Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox iii DEDICATION This recovery plan is dedicated to the memory of Devra Kleiman and Linda Munson, who passed away in 2010. They were both instru mental in developing this plan and in constructing effective recovery actions for island foxes. Devra served on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Island Fox Recovery Coordination Group, and as such was an aut hor of this document. She was truly a giant in conservation biology a nd generously lent her consid erable talents to island fox recovery. She was a passionate advocate of implementing recovery actions in a scientific manner, and of appropriate e nvironmental education, and she successfully integrated the mainland zoo community into the island fox conservation effort. Her forthright, direct style of communication enlivened many recovery team meetings. Linda Munson was one of the world's leadi ng carnivore pathologists, and led studies of island fox disease and pathology sin ce 1999. She conducted hundreds of island fox necropsies, and it is not hyperbol e to say that all of our cu rrent insight into island fox health issues is due to her tireless work. Linda led the Island Fox Health Group since 1999, and under her guidance they were always the most disciplined, effective and productive of the island fox recovery t eam working groups. Among the issues she discovered or brought to the fo refront were the unique, is land-specific parasite fauna of island foxes, the nature of the canine distemper strain on Santa Catalina Island and the endemic distemper-like virus found na turally in island fox populations, chronic amyloidosis, ear tumors on Santa Catalina, a nd neonatal deaths from maternal neglect. Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox iv Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox v EXECUTIVE SUMMARY In 2004, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (F WS) listed four of th e six subspecies of island fox endemic to the California Ch annel Islands as endangered under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act), following cat astrophic population declines (69 FR 10335). Th e San Miguel Island fox ( Urocyon littoralis littoralis ) went from an estimated 450 individual s to 15; the Santa Rosa Island fox ( U. l. santarosae ) declined from over 1,750 individuals to 15; the number of Santa Cruz Island foxes ( U. l. santacruzae ) went from approximately 1,450 individuals to approximately 55; and the Santa Catalina Island fox ( U. l. catalinae ) declined from over 1,300 to 103. The San Clemente Island fox ( U. l. clementae ) and the San Nicolas Island fox ( U. l. dickeyi ) were not federally listed, as their population numbers had not experienced similar declines. However, bot h non-federally listed subspecies could experience the same type of population declin e as those subspecies that are federally listed. Additionally, all six subspecies are listed as th reatened by the State of California. Therefore, the San Clemente and San Nicolas Island fox subspecies are included for discussion in this plan where appropriate. The Channel Islands inhabited by island f oxes are owned by four major landowners: the National Park Service (NPS), the U.S. Navy (Navy), The Nature Conservancy (TNC), and the Santa Catalina Island Conservancy (CIC). Although San Miguel Island is owned by the Navy, it is within Channel Islands National Park and is managed by the NPS. The NPS, TNC, and CIC manage the islands where the listed subspecies occur. The FWS guides the recovery planning process for the four federally-listed island fox subspecies unde r the Act. In addition, the State of California has regulatory authority over th e island fox on non-Federal lands because the species is listed as threatened unde r the California Endangered Species Act. The two primary known threats that resulted in the listing of the four subspecies of island fox as federally endangered we re: 1) predation by golden eagles ( Aquila chrysaetos ) (San Miguel Island fox, Santa Rosa Is land fox, and Santa Cruz Island fox) and 2) the transmission of canine distem per virus (Santa Catalina Island fox). Additionally, because the si ze of each island fox populati on was small, they were highly vulnerable to stochastic events and the effects of low genetic diversity. Other threats that either contributed to the declin e of island foxes or c ontinue to affect the island fox subspecies and/or their habitat include habita t degradation from grazing; other diseases and parasites; competition with feral cats, deer, and pigs; and mortality from vehicle strikes. We note however, ma ny of these threats are not present on all islands, such as vehicle strike s, feral cats, pigs, and deer. The current knowledge regarding the evol ution, ecology, behavior, and population biology of island foxes has been amasse d by numerous researchers from around the Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox vi country. Collaboration with researchers has been, and will continue to be, critically important in understanding island fox natu ral history and recovery challenges. Recovery of each subspecies of island fox will be achieved by removing, or substantially reducing, known threats and increasing populati ons to viable levels for long-term survival of each subspecies. Th e strategy of this re covery plan is to continue the current recovery efforts and to improve and expand recovery actions as necessary. Recent and ongoing island fox recovery effort s include: removing golden eagles from the northern Channel Islands; re ducing the threat of disease; breeding island foxes in captivity and reintroducing them to the wild; monitoring wild island fox populations; removal of non-native species (e.g., golden eagle prey); and while not part of island fox recovery effo rts, reintroducing bald eagles ( Haliaeetus leucocephalus ) with the goal of deterring golden eag les from establishing territories on the Channel Islands. Additionally, ongoing act ivities that contribute to a long-term conservation strategy include: conducting research on behavioral ecology and reproductive biology; increasing island fox education and out reach activities to reduce anthropogenic impacts; restoring island habitat; and assessing the demographic impact of other threats such as mortality from vehicles, competition with feral cats, and emerging disease issues (e.g., ear cancer). Since 1999, island fox recovery efforts by the land management agencies (NPS, TNC, and CIC) have included efforts to reduce the two major threats to island foxes that caused the precipitous declines. Mortality due to golden eagle predation on the three island fox subspecies from the northern Cha nnel Islands (San Miguel, Santa Rosa, and Santa Cruz Islands) has been reduced. The threat posed by disease to Santa Catalina Island foxes continues to be ameliorated w ith disease mitigation efforts. All land management efforts have included bringing wild island foxes into captivity to serve as a temporary sanctuary from threats, increasi ng populations of each subspecies through captive breeding, and releasing captive individua ls back into the wild. For a period of time, the entire San Miguel Island and Sant a Rosa Island fox populat ions were held in captivity. Reintroduction was eminently succes sful. Released foxes had high survival and reproductive success, and recovering fox populations grew rapidly. This allowed management agencies to cease all captive breeding and reintroduction by 2008. Recovery efforts to date have increased the numbers of foxes on all islands and reduced the risk of extinction. Wild popul ations of island foxes have been re- established on San Miguel and Santa Rosa Is lands. Predation has been a negligible mortality factor on San Miguel Island and Santa Cruz Island, where annual survival of island foxes has remained greater than 80 percent since 2004 for San Miguel Island and since 2008 for Santa Cruz Island. A nnual survival has be en greater than 80 percent on Santa Rosa Isla nd since 2008, though eagle predation occurred again in 2010. Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox vii Following disease mitigation efforts, the Santa Catalina Island fox population is increasing. The threat of disease, such as that posed by ear tumors, is of continued concern for the Santa Catalina Island fox. Ot her potential threats to the Santa Catalina Island foxes include competiti on with feral cats and mortal ity from vehicle strikes. As of 2013, island fox populat ions increased to >1,000 i ndividuals on Santa Catalina and Santa Cruz Islands, almost 900 on Sant a Rosa Island, and close to 600 on San Miguel Island. Additionally, all island fox s ubspecies currently have annual survival estimates greater than 80 percent. Recovery Goal: The goal of this recovery plan is to recover the San Miguel Island fox, the Santa Rosa Island fox, the Sant a Cruz Island fox, and the Santa Catalina Island fox so they can be delisted (removed from listing under the Act) when existing threats to each respective subspecies have been ameliorated, thereby stabilizing and augmenting their populations. Each listed subspecies may be considered for downlisting or delisting independe ntly of the other subspecies. Recovery Objectives: Recovery objectives identif y mechanisms for measuring progress toward and achieving the recovery goal for each subspecies. Achieving the recovery goal requires: 1) increasing the popula tion size to levels and demographic rates that are self-sustaining, and 2) reduci ng or eliminating the current threats to the survival of each subspecies. Recovery Objective 1: Each federally listed subspecies of island fox exhibits demographic characteristics consistent with long-term viability. Recovery Objective 2: Land managers are able to respond in a tim ely fashion to predation by nesting golden eagles or significant predation rates by transient golden eagles, to potential or incipient disease outbreaks, and to ot her identified threats using th e best available technology. In order for any one of the f our listed subspecies of isla nd fox to be considered for downlisting from endangered to threatened stat us, recovery objective 1 should be met. In order for any one of the f our listed subspecies of isla nd fox to be considered for delisting from endangered or threatened to delisted status, recovery objective 1 and recovery objective 2 should be met. Recovery Criteria Recovery criteria are measurable standards fo r determining that a species has achieved its recovery objectives and may be consid ered for downlisting or delisting. The Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox viii recovery criteria presented in this recovery plan represent our best assessment of the conditions that would most likely result in a determination that downlisting and/or delisting of the San Miguel Island fox, Sant a Rosa Island fox, Santa Cruz Island fox, or Santa Catalina Island fox is warranted. Population Risk-based Recovery Criteria Recovery criterion E/1 was developed to address recovery objective 1. Recovery Criterion E/1: An island fox subspecies has no more than 5 percent risk of qua si-extinction over a 50-year period. This risk level is based upon the following: Quasi-extinction is define d as a population size of 30 individuals. The risk of extinction is calculated based on the combined lower 80 percent confidence interval for a 3-year runn ing average of popula tion size estimates, and the upper 80 percent confidence interv al for a 3year running average of mortality rate estimates. This 5 percent (or less) risk level is su stained for at least 5 years, during which time the population trend is not declining. A declining trend is defined as the 3- year risk-level being greate r in year 5 than year 1. This risk-based recovery criterion is based on models developed separately for each listed subspecies. Threat-based Recovery Criteria To meet recovery objective 2, recove ry criteria C/1 and C/2 are achieved. Recovery Criterion C/1 - Golden Eagle Predation: To reduce the threat of extinction to th e San Miguel Island fox, the Santa Rosa Island fox, and the Santa Cruz Island fox from golden eagle predation: 1. A golden eagle management strategy is developed and approved by the land manager(s) in collaboration with the FWS, including review by the appropriate Integrated Island Fox Recovery Team (IRT) Technical Expertise Group (TEG) or the equivale nt. This strategy must include: Response tactics (including the use of helicopters and net-guns) to capture nesting golden eagles and any transient golden eagle responsible for significant island f ox predation per the golden eagle response strategy; Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox ix Tactics to minimize the establishment of successful nesting golden eagles; An established island fox monitoring program for each subspecies that is able to detect an annual isla nd fox predation rate caused by golden eagles of 2.5 percent or greater , averaged over 3 years; and An established mortality rate or population size threshold for each subspecies of island fox that, if re ached due to golden eagle predation, would require the land manager(s) to bring island foxes into captivity for safety. 2. The golden eagle prey base of deer and elk is removed from Santa Rosa Island. At present, golden eagle s are not known to prey upon Santa Catalina Island foxes. If mortality as a result of golden eagle predation becomes a threat to the Santa Ca talina Island fox, the golden eagle management strategy will be implemented. Recovery Criterion C/2 - Disease: To reduce the threat of extinction to th e San Miguel Island fox, the Santa Rosa Island fox, the Santa Cruz Island fox, a nd the Santa Catalina Island fox from disease: 1. A disease management strategy is developed, approved, and implemented by the land manager(s) in collaboration with the FWS, including review by the appropriate IRT TEG or the equiva lent. This strategy must include: Identification of a portion of each s ubspecies that will be vaccinated against canine distemper virus and rabies, the diseases posing the greatest risk and for which vaccines ar e safe, effective, and available. Vaccinations to be provided and numbers vaccinated will be developed in consultation with appropria te subject-matter experts; Identification of actual and potential pathogens of island foxes, and the means by which these can be prevented from decimating fox populations; Measures to prevent diseases in island foxes; A monitoring program that provides for timely detection of a disease outbreak, and an associated em ergency response strategy as recommended by the appropriate subject-matter experts; and A process for updating the disease management strategy as new information arises. Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox x Recovery Actions The actions identified below are those th at, in our opinion, are necessary to bring about the recovery of island foxes. Thes e actions are subject to modification as dictated by new findings, changes in species status, and the completion of recovery actions. 1. Reduce mortality for each subspecies of island fox to ensure populations persist at sustainable levels. 2. Conduct captive breeding and reintroduction of isla nd foxes to increase population size. 3. Establish island fox mo nitoring strategies. Estimated Total Cost of Recovery San Miguel Island fox: $1,076,000 Santa Rosa Island fox: $1,076,000 $5,257,500 Grand Total: $8,485,500, plus costs that are unable to be determined at this time. Date of Recovery: If recovery criteria are met, we estimate the northern Channel Is lands fox subspecies (San Miguel Island fox, Santa Rosa Island f ox, and Santa Cruz Island fox) could be recovered by 2020 (4 years) and the Sant a Catalina Island fox by 2024 (8 years). Long-term Conservation Strategy The long-term conservation strategy include d herein identifies actions that would further the conservation of th e island fox. Long-term conservation may be benefitted by conducting research on behavioral ecol ogy and reproductive biology; increasing island fox education and outre ach activities to reduce anth ropogenic impacts; restoring island habitat; and assessing the demographic impact of other threats such as mortality from vehicles, competition with fe ral cats, and emerging disease issues (e.g., ear cancer). At this time, these activitie s are not essential fo r preventing extinction and are not required for downlisting or deli sting a particular is land fox subspecies; however, these activities could substantially enhance the long-term conservation of the species and may also increase our scientif ic understanding of the island fox. In the event that an island fox subspecies is recovered and delisted, completion of these actions may further reduce the potential for any of the subspecies to be relisted in the future.

Background A. INTRODUCTION The island fox ( Urocyon littoralis ), a diminutive relativ e of the gray fox ( U. cinereoargenteus ), is endemic to the Californi a Channel Islands. Island foxes inhabit six of the eight Channel Island s (San Miguel Island, Santa Rosa Island, Santa Cruz Island, Santa Ca talina Island, San Nicolas Island, and San Clemente Island) and are recognized as a distinct subspecies on each of the six islands (Figure 1). Both morphologic and genetic distinctions support the classification of separate subspecies for each island (C ollins 1993; Gilbert et al. 1990; Goldstein et al. 1999; Wayne et al. 1991a). 1. Legal Status Four of the six island fox subspecies expe rienced catastrophic declines in the late 1990s, primarily due to golden eagle pred ation on the northern Channel Islands (San Miguel Island, Santa Rosa Islan d, and Santa Cruz Island) and canine distemper virus (CDV) outbreak (Table 1) on Santa Catalina Island (Timm et al. 2009). In June 2001, the Center for Biologi cal Diversity petiti oned the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) to list the four subspecies in catastrophic decline as endangered as defined by the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). In 2004, the FWS listed the San Miguel Is land fox, Santa Rosa Island fox, Santa Cruz Island fox, and Santa Catalina Isla nd fox as endangered (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2004) pursuant to the Ac t. The remaining two subspecies, the San Nicolas Island fox ( U. l. dickeyi ) and San Clemente Island fox ( U. l. clementae ), did not experience the same type of population declines and thus, were not federally listed. However, concerns about the status of the San Clemente Island fox population prompted the Navy to enter into a Conservation Agreement with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS-LA-3287.1) and to undertake proactive measures to under stand and mitigate potential impacts. The California Fish and Game Commission listed the island fox as a rare species in 1971. All animals that had been determin ed to be rare on or before January 1, 1985 were designated as \"threatened species \" at that time. The IUCN (World Conservation Union) listed the entire species as Critically Endangered in 2001 (Sillero-Zubiri and Macdonald 2004). The San Clemente Island fox ( U. l. clementae ) and the San Nicolas Island fox ( U. l. dickeyi ) are not federally listed, as their population numbers did not experience similar declines. However, all six subsp ecies are listed as threatened by the State of California. Therefore, the San Clemente Island fox ( U. l. clementae ) and the San Nicolas Island fox ( U. l. dickeyi ) subspecies are included for discussion in this plan. Following the Federal listing of the island fox in 2004, the FWS considered designating critical habitat for the four lis ted subspecies. However, in its final Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 2 determination concerning critical habitat for the island fox (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2005), the FWS concluded that no habitat met the definition of critical habitat in the Act and theref ore, did not designate any critical habita t for any of the four subspecies. Critic al habitat is defined in s ection 3(5)(A) of the Act in part as: the specific areas within the ge ographical area occupied by a species, at the time it is listed in accordance with the Act, on which are found those physical or biological features essential to the conservation of the species and that may require special management considerat ions or protection. The FWS did not designate any critical hab itat for the island fox because : 1) the island fox is a habitat generalist and an opportunistic omnivore; 2) the primary reasons for the listing of the fox were predation and dis ease; and 3) prior to predation by golden eagles and the outbreak of disease, habita t did not appear to be a limiting factor despite human-induced habita t changes that have occurred. The FWS concluded that there are no specific areas where physic al or biological feat ures are essential to the conservation of the species and that may require special management considerations or protection; therefore, designating cri tical habitat would not be beneficial.

Affected Agencies, Landowners, and Partners Islands inhabited by island foxes are owned by four major landowners: the National Park Service (NPS), the U.S. Navy (Navy), The Nature Conservancy (TNC), and the Santa Catalina Island Conservancy (CIC), all of whom have management authority for wildlife on thei r lands (Figure 1, Table 2). The NPS, TNC, and CIC manage the islands where th e listed subspecies occur. The FWS guides the recovery planning process for the four listed island fox subspecies under the Act. Additionally, the State of California has regulatory authority over the island fox on non-Federal lands. The bulk of the current knowledge rega rding the evolution, ecology, behavior, and population biology of island foxes ha s been amassed by researchers from California institutions, including the Univ ersity of California (Los Angeles, Davis, Santa Barbara, and Santa Cruz), Ca lifornia State Universi ty (Los Angeles), the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History, and the non-pr ofit Institute for Wildlife Studies (IWS). In addition, researchers from a numb er of other U.S. institutions and organizations, including the Associat ion of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA), Conservation Breeding Specialist Gr oup (SSC/IUCN), the Honolulu Zoo, the Lincoln Park Zoo, New Mexico State Univ ersity, the Santa Barbara Zoo, the Saint Louis Zoo, and the U.S. Geological Su rvey - Biological Resource Discipline (USGS-BRD) have contributed to the unders tanding of island fox natural history and recovery challenges. Collaboration with researchers has been, and will continue to be, critical ly important for island fox recovery efforts. Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 4 Figure 1.

Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 6 3. Integration of Conservation and Recovery Efforts By 1999, island fox populations on the norther n Channel Islands were considered to be in need of immediate conser vation action (Coonan et al. 1998; Roemer 1999). The NPS convened a multi-disciplinary group of experts in 1999 (Island Fox Conservation Working Group) to ev aluate available island fox status information and develop strategies to r ecover the island fox populations to viable levels. This was a loose affiliation of public agency representatives, landowners, conservancies, zoological institutio ns, non-profits, and academics concerned about conservation efforts for the island fox. This group met annually from 1999 through 2004 and broadened its focus to include concerns about all six island f ox subspecies. The working group served as a forum for information exchange and evaluation of recovery efforts. To address most issues, the group further divi ded into subject matter groups, such as management of wild populations, manage ment of captive popul ations, island fox husbandry, veterinary issues, policy issues, and educational outreach needs. The group reported annually on the status of island foxes on all islands and listed findings regarding threats to the species and appropriate mitigation actions (Coonan and Rutz 2001, 2002, 2003; Coonan et al. 2004, 2005b). In 2004, after four of the six subspecies were federally listed, the island fox Integrated Recovery Team (IRT; s ee Appendix 1) was established and incorporated the expertise of all 70+ individuals from the former working groups. At the same time, the island fox Recovery Coordination Group (RCG; see Appendix 1) was established with repr esentatives from each of the land management agencies as well as additiona l canid experts. The FWS' goal for the RCG was both to draft the r ecovery plan using the knowle dge and expertise of the IRT and to advise the FWS on immediate conservation needs. Tasks regarding management and recovery of island foxes were developed by the RCG and submitted to a task force for analysis; each task was formally referred to as a Technical Analysis Request (TAR). E ach task force group was comprised of individuals from the larger IRT. In add ition to incorporating the information into this recovery plan, the RCG forwarded the resulting analyses to the FWS, with recommendations for recovery actions needed immediately. The FWS then transmitted the analyses and recommendatio ns to the land management agencies so that ongoing recovery efforts could take advantage of the best available information prior to the formal completi on of an approved recovery plan. Since 2004, the land management agencies have received recommendations regarding releases from captivity and post-releas e monitoring, management and husbandry for captive populations, management of golden eagles, and establishment of a mainland captive population. The RCG also organized two population viability analysis meetings for the four federally listed subspecies, a monitoring workshop, and coordinated the annual island f ox meetings in 2005 and 2006. In 2007, the Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 7 meeting marked a return to the format of the working group, focusing on status updates for all subspecies and results of recent research, as well as consideration of issues by small workgroups. The Island Fox Working Group has met annually through 2014. B. BIOLOGICAL INFORMATION 1. Description and Taxonomy A diminutive relative of the mainla nd gray fox, the island fox weighs approximately 1.8 to 3.0 kilograms (kg) (3 to 6 pounds (lb)) and stands approximately 30 centimeters (cm) (12 in ches (in)) tall. The island fox is distinguished from the gray fox by its darker pelage and its smaller size (Collins 1982); most linear measurements of island foxes are 25 percent smaller than those of the gray fox. The dorsal coloration is grayis h-white and black, and the base of the ears and sides of the neck and limbs are cinnamon-rufous in color (Moore and Collins 1995). The underbelly is a dull white, and the tail is conspicuously short. Island foxes display sexual size dimorphism , with males being larger and heavier than females (Collins 1982, 1993). The island fox was first described as Vulpes littoralis by Baird in 1857 from the type locality on San Miguel Island, Sa nta Barbara County, California (Baird 1857). Merriam (1888, in Hall and Kelson 1959) reclassified the island fox into the genus Urocyon and later described island fo xes from Santa Catalina, San Clemente, and Santa Cruz Islands as three separate species (U. catalinae , U. (1937) revised Merriam's classifica tion, placing foxes from all islands under the species U. littoralis and assigning each island populat ion a subspecific designation ( U. l. catalinae on Santa Catalina Island, U. l. clementae on San Clemente Island, U. l. dickeyi on San Nicolas Island, U. l. littoralis on San Miguel Island, U. l. santacruzae on Santa Cruz Island, and U. l. santarosae on Santa Rosa Island). Recent morphological and genetic studi es support this division of the U. littoralis complex into six subspecies, each restricted in range to a single island (Collins 1991a, 1993; Gilbert et al. 1990; Goldstei n et al. e et al. 1991a, 1991b). 2. Distribution, Evol ution, and Genetics Island foxes inhabit the six largest Calif ornia Channel islands off the coast of southern California (San Miguel Island, Santa Rosa Island, Santa Cruz Island, San Nicolas Island, Santa Catalina Island, and San Clemente Island). Until recently, colonization of the islands by foxes wa s thought to have occurred sometime during the Pleistocene, before human pres ence on the islands. This was supported by genetic evidence that suggested all island foxes are descended from one colonization event (George and Wayne 1991), possibly from chance, over-water Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 8 dispersal by rafting on floating debris (Moore and Collins 1995). However, recent re-dating of island fox fossils indi cates that the earlie st known island fox remains are no more than 6,000 years old (R ick et al. 2009). This raises the possibility that Native Americans transported foxes from the mainland to the northern islands sometime after human contact (10,000-13,000 years ago). Island foxes may have reached the southern Channel Islands (San Nicolas, San Clemente, and Santa Catalina Islands) much more recently (2,200 to 3,800 years ago), and were most likely introduced to these islands by Native Americans as pets or semi-domesticates (Collins 1991a, 1991b). Island fox remains recently recovered from San Nicolas Island extend this time period to approximately 5,200 years before presen t (Vellanoweth 1998). Morphologically, the species exhibits inter- island variability in size, nasal shape and projection, and the number of tail vert ebrae (Collins 1982). Genetic evidence supports the separation of the species into six distinct subspecies, and confirms the pattern of dispersal, though perhap s not the timing, suggested by archeology and geology. A study of genetic variability in DNA restriction fragments in island foxes (Gilbert et al. 1990) revealed that inter-island variability was greater than intra-island variability. Phylogeny based upon restriction fragment variability supports the geological eviden ce for the sequence of isolation of each island, and each population, as rising sea levels separated Santarosae into the northern Channel Islands. Santa Cruz Island separated from the other northern islands first, about 11,500 years ago, fo llowed by the separation of San Miguel Island and Santa Rosa Island about 9,500 years ago. Together with the fossil record, restriction fragment evidence indi cates that San Clemente Island was the first southern Channel Island colonized, probably by immigrants from San Miguel Island. Dispersal then occurred from Sa n Clemente Island to San Nicolas and Santa Catalina Islands. Island forms generally have less genetic variability than their mainland counterparts. Mainland gray foxes we re found to be more variable in morphology, allozymes , mitochondrial DNA, and hypervariable nuclear DNA than island foxes (Goldstein et al. 19 99; Wayne et al. 1991a). The island fox populations with the fewest numbers of individuals, San Miguel Island and San Nicolas Island, showed the least genetic variability, and the San Nicolas Island population was actually monomorphic (s howing no variation) in allozyme, hypervariable minisatellite and micros atellite DNA, and mitochondrial DNA, which is highly unusual among mammals. This lack of variability could be attributed either to extensive inbreeding or to bottlenecking resulting from low population densities (George and Wayne 1991). On San Miguel and San Nicolas Islands, the species has apparently ex isted for thousands of years at low effective population sizes (150 to 1000), with low genetic variability (Wayne et al. 1991a, Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 9 1991b). The Santa Rosa Island and San Miguel Island populations have been shown to be closely related (Wayne et al. 1991b). Recently, Aguilar et al. (2004) found c onsiderable variation at the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in San Nicolas Island foxes, which contain genes that code for disease resistance and kin recognition. Modeling by the authors suggests that the pattern of MHC and neutral marker variation in San Nicolas Island foxes was caused by an extrem e bottleneck (a decline to fewer than 10 animals) in the past 10 to 20 generations. Recently, genetic relatedness among indi viduals was determined for the San Miguel Island and Santa Rosa Island captiv e populations (Gray et al. 2001; Gray 2002). Analysis of island fox blood samples from 1988 and from the captive population in 2001 indicated that the level of variation in is land foxes on the two islands had declined since 1988. During that time period, there was a reduction in the number of alleles at some loci and, at some loci, a complete loss of polymorphism . However, there are no apparent deleterious effects of inbreeding in island foxes (Coonan et al. 2010). 3. Habitat Use and Food Habits The island fox is a habitat generalist, o ccurring in all natural habitats on the Channel Islands, although it prefers areas of diverse topography and vegetation (von Bloeker 1967; Laughrin 1977; Moore and Collins 1995). Island foxes occur in valley and foothill grasslands, southern coastal dune, coastal bluff, coastal sage scrub, maritime cactus scrub, island chaparral, southern coastal oak woodland, southern riparian woodland, Bishop and To rrey pine forests, and coastal marsh habitat types. Crooks and Van Vuren ( 1996) found island foxes to prefer fennel (Foeniculum vulgare) and to avoid ravines and sc rub oak patches on Santa Cruz Island. Island foxes may use non-native gras slands less than ot her habitats, even though insect prey is abundant in grassl ands, because grasslands are denser and may be more difficult to forage in (Roemer and Wayne 2003). Also, low vegetation types such as grasslands ma y render island foxes more vulnerable to aerial predators (Roemer 1999). Island foxes are omnivores and forage opportu nistically, eating a wide variety of seasonally available plants and animal s (Collins 1980; Collins and Laughrin 1979; Crooks and and Dow 1981; Laughrin 1973, 1977; Moore and Collins 1995). Island foxes feed on a wide variety of insect prey, such as grasshoppers, crickets, and katydids (Crooks and Van Vuren 1995; Moore and Collins 1995) and Jerusalem crickets (Stenopelmatus fuscus) when seasonally available (Moore and Collins 1995). Island foxes prey on native deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) on all islands and also likely prey upon introduced house mice (Mus musculus) on Santa Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 10 Catalina Island and introduced rats (Rattus rattus) on Santa Catalina, San Miguel, and San Clemente Islands. Deer mice ma y be especially important prey during the breeding season, because they are larg e, energy-rich food items that adult foxes can bring back to their growing pups (Garcelon et al. 1999). In addition to small mammals, island foxes prey on gr ound-nesting birds such as (Sturnella in the diet are amphibians, rept iles, and the carrion of marine mammals (Collins and Laughrin 1979). Island foxes f eed on a wide variety of native plants, including the fruits of Arctostaphylos, (Moore and Collins 1995). San Miguel Island foxes rely more on the fruits of sea-fig, Carpobrotus chilensis (Collins 1980; Crowell 2001). A comprehe nsive treatment of island fox diet is found in Moore and Collins (1995). The island fox is a docile canid , exhibiting little fear of humans in many instances. Although primarily noctu rnal, the island fox is more diurnal than the mainland gray fox (Collins and Laughrin 1979; Crooks and Van Vuren 1995; Fausett 1993), possibly a result of hist orical absence of large predators and freedom from human harassment on the islands (Laughrin 1977). 4. Social Organiza tion and Reproduction Island foxes generally have sm aller territories, exist at higher densities, and have shorter dispersal distances than mainland fox species, characteristics typical of vertebrate populations on islands (Roeme r 1999; Roemer et al. 2001a). Island fox home range size and confi guration are dependent on la ndscape features, resource distribution, fox population density, habita t type, season, and sex of the animal (Fausett 1982; Laughrin 1977; Crooks and Van Vuren 1996; Thompson et al. 1998). Recorded home-range estimates range from 0.24 square kilometer (km 2) (0.09 square mile (mi2)) in mixed habitat (Crook s and Van Vuren 1996) and 0.87 km2 (0.34 mi2) in grassland Cruz Island, to 0.77 km2 (0.3 mi2) in canyons on San Clemente Island (Thompson et al. 1998). Island fox territory size on Santa Cruz Island varied from 0.15 to 0.87 km2 mi2) during a period of moderate to high fox density (7 island foxes per km2 [18 per mi2]) (Roemer et al. 2001a). Research on Santa Cruz Island found that island foxes, like most foxes, exist as socially monogamous pairs occupying discre te territories (Roemer et al. 2001a). Territory configuration cha nged after the death and repl acement of paired male foxes, but not after the death and replacem ent of paired females or juveniles, indicating that adult males are involved in territory formation and maintenance. Despite being socially monogamous and territoria l, island foxes are not necessarily genetically monogamous. On Santa Cruz Island, 4 of 16 offspring whose parents were identified by paternity analysis were a re sult of extra-pair Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 11 fertilizations (Roemer rred between foxes from adjoining territories. Island fox courtship activities occur from late January to early March (Moore and Collins 1995). In the island fox captive breeding facility on San Miguel Island, copulations were observed during the first 2 weeks of March 2000, and copulation for the successful pairs li kely occurred between mid- February and early March (Coonan and Rutz 2001, 2002). Young are born from early to late April after a gestation period of approximately 50 to 53 days. Births occurred in the NPS' island fox captive breeding facilities from April 1 to April 25 (Coonan et al. 2010). Island foxes give birth to their young in simple dens, unde r shrubs, or in the sides of ravines (Laughrin 1973). Litter size ranges from one to five (Moore and Collins 1995); mean litter size for 24 dens on Santa Cruz Island was 2.17 (Laughlin 1977). The average number of foxes produced in 51 litters in captivity from 1999 to 2004 was 2.4 (Coonan et al. 2005b ). Like other fox species, island foxes exhibit biparental car e (care by both parents), ev idenced by the capture of adult male foxes in the same traps as pups and observations of adults and known offspring foraging together (Garcelon et al. 1999; Roemer 1999). By 2 months of age, young foxes spend most of the day outsi de the den and will remain with their parents throughout the summer. Some pups disperse away from their natal territories by winter, although others may st ay on their natal terr itories into their second year. Although island foxes are physio logically capable of breed ing at the end of their first year (Laughrin 1977), most breeding i nvolves older animals. Coonan et al. (2000) found that only 16 percent of 1 to 2 year old females bred over a 5-year period on San Miguel Island, in contrast to 60 percent of older females. Roemer (1999) found yearling females to have lowe r fertility than older females on Santa Cruz Island. However, females reintroduced from captive facilities on San Miguel Island have produced litters at 1 year of age (Coonan et al. 2010). Prior to the catastrophic popul ation declines of the 1990s, adult island foxes were reported to live an average of 4 to 6 years (Moore and Collins 1995); Coonan et al. (1998) recorded eight i ndividuals on San Miguel Isla nd that lived 7 to 10 years in the wild. 5. Mortality Sources an d Population Dynamics In an effort to describe the basic biol ogy and life history ch aracteristics of the island fox, the following section descri bes current and historic sources of mortality to the island fox, as well as the population dynamics of the species. In many cases, there is an overlap between the sources of mortality described here and the current threats to the species. Ho wever, the specific threats to the species Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 12 are considered more fully in the section of this document entitled, \"Threats to the Species.\" (a) Golden Eagles. Predation by golden eagles drove the island fox subspecies on San Miguel, Santa Cruz , and Santa Rosa Islands to near extinction in the late 1990s (Roemer 1999; Roemer et al. 2001b; Coonan et al. 2005c). Golden eagle predatio n has continued to be the primary mortality factor for foxes on the northern Channel Islands. The extirpation of bald eagles ( Haliaeetus leucocephalus ) from the Islands as a re sult of dichlorodiphenyltr ichloroethane (DDT) may have facilitated golden eagle coloniza tion. Bald eagles historically bred on the islands and aggression by breeding bald eagles may have discouraged foraging golden eagles from establishing residence. Bald eagles are represented in the prehis toric fossil record of the northern Channel Islands (Guthrie 1993) and bred there until 1960, when nest failures, as a result of DDT cont amination, extirpat ed them from the northern Channel Islands (Kiff 1980). The northern Channel Islands (Anacapa, Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, and San Miguel Islands) likely supported more than 14 pairs of bald eagles before their decline (Kiff 1980). Bald eagles normally rely on marine resources as a food resource base (Newsome et al. 2010); while gol den eagles traditionally focus on terrestrial species (Collins and Latt a 2009). Additionally, on much of the northern Channel Islands, historic sh eep grazing changed the predominant vegetation from shrub to non-native gr asslands, which offered foxes much less cover from aerial predators. Except for golden eagles, red-tailed hawks ( Buteo jamaicensis ) are the only other confirmed avian predator of island foxes (Laughrin 1980; Moore and Collins 1995), and likely only prey on island fox pups, not on adult island fox. There have been unconfirmed historical reports of predation by bald eagles, but there is no current or recent evidence to suggest that foxes are a dominant pr ey item of bald eagles. Island fox remains have been found in bald eag le nests; however, it is not known whether the individuals were depred ated or scavenged (Collins et al. 2005). (b) Canine Distemper Virus. A CDV outbreak was the cause of decline for the island fox subspecies on Sant a Catalina Island (Timm et al. 2009). This disease remains a potential mort ality factor for island foxes and is capable of causing a catastroph ic decline (Timm et al. 2000, 2002; Kohlmann et al. 2005). Recent serological surveys recorded the presence Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 13 of antibodies reactive against CDV in w ild foxes on all islands (Clifford et al. 2006, Coonan et al. 2010), suggesting that exposure to CDV or a similar morbillivirus has occurred in all is land fox subspecies, with survival of many infected individuals. A natural CDV-like morbillivirus is thus likely circulating within is land fox populations, and confers some immunity to CDV. The endemic CD V-like strain is apparently less virulent than other stra ins of CDV, and has no apparent effect on fox populations (Coonan et al. 2010). (c) Other Factors. Additional mortality factors for island foxes include, but are not limited to, vehicle strikes on roads, other diseases, and parasites. At least one case of isla nd fox mortality due to shooting by an unknown person(s) was confirmed in 2007 on Santa Catalina Island (King and Duncan 2008). Collision with motor vehicles remains a threat to island foxes on San Nicolas and San Clemente Islands (Moore and Collins 1995) and on Santa Catalina Island (Munson 2010). On Santa Catalina Island, annual averages of four foxes pe r year were killed by vehicles from 2002 to 2007. More than 30 foxes are killed by vehicles annually on San Clemente Island (Garcelon et al. 2008). On San Nicolas Island, an average of 17 foxes was killed by vehicles annually between 1993-2013, with 22 foxes killed by vehicles in 2013 (F. Ferrara, U.S. Navy, pers. comm. 2014). This average includes only foxes that were killed instantly. We believe it is likely that some foxes were hit and later succumbed to their injuries, or that there are juve niles who did not survive following the death of the mother. Because we do not have a method to document this type of mortality, the actual annual mortality due to vehicles is likely higher. However, vehicle speed limits have been lowered, speed limits are enforced, road shoulders are mowed, and outreach and awareness have increased in an attempt to reduce vehi cle related mortalit y on San Nicolas Island. Island foxes have shown previous expos ure to infectious agents such as canine parvovirus, canine adenovirus, can ine corona virus, canine herpes virus, and toxoplasmosis (Garcelon et al. 1992; Roemer et al. 2001b; Clifford et al 2006), but di sease resulting from these infectious agents was not found to be a mortality factor until CDV and toxoplasmosis was confirmed in a dead fox on Santa Ca talina Island in 1999 (Munson 2010). Different island fox subspecies have been exposed to multiple serovars of Leptospira in the past, but leptospirosis was not a mortality cause until 2010, when a Leptospira outbreak on Santa Rosa Island was associated with the mortalities of two radio-co llared foxes (Coonan and Guglielmino 2012). Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 14 The recent finding of ear tumors in Sa nta Catalina Island foxes, confirmed to be a source of mortality in wild f oxes, is of high enough frequency to be considered a concern (Coonan et al . 2010). The first case of this ceruminous gland carcinoma, a rare but aggressive malignant tumor, was diagnosed in 2001. The tumors are prim arily confined to the ears of the animals, but in some cases spread to the head and neck region and eventually may metastasize (Munson 2010). The disease has been found in all Santa Catalina Island fox age groups, except pups. In 2004, veterinarians found that a high proporti on of the adults either had these tumors or showed signs of tissue cha nges that are possible precursors to tumor development (Munson 2010). The tumors are associated with severe otitis and infections of Otodectes (ear mites). Otodectes are present in island fox populations on other isla nds; however, the tumors only occur in Santa Catalina Island foxes. Parasites have not been confirmed as a mortality source, except for rare cases of complications from Spirocerca (nematode) infection (Munson 2010). In a species-wide survey, Spirocerca was found in a high prevalence of necropsied island foxes, but in most cases appeared to have little effect on individual health (Munson 2010). Preliminary genetic analysis and the location of lesions suggest that the Spirocerca found in island foxes may be a di fferent species than S. lupi , which occurs in domestic dogs and other North American carnivores on the mainland. Currently, Spirocerca is not a major health conc ern for most island foxes. However, if island foxes are to be brought to the mainland, efforts should be made to prevent transmission of Spirocerca from island foxes to mainland carnivores and vice versa. Heavy parasite infections by hookworms (Uncinaria stenocephala) and a lungworm (Angiocaulus gubernaculatus) may have contributed to two mortalities in the San Miguel Island f ox subspecies (Coonan et al. 2005c). Angiocaulus is not found in other island f ox subspecies (Faulkner et al. 2001). Unusual infection by acanthocephalans (spiny-headed worms) was detected in San Miguel Island foxes in 2011-2012, and may have contributed to the death of at l east one radio-collared fox (Coonan 2013). (d) Population Dynamics. Even in the absence of catastrophic mortality sources, island fox populati ons may have fluctuated markedly over time (Laughrin 1980). Resident s of Santa Cruz Island occasionally noted periods of island fox scarcity and abundance. Santa Catalina Island fox population levels were low in 19 72 and again at low density in 1977 (Laughrin 1980). However, by 1994 the adult Santa Catalina Island fox population was estimated at over 1,300 i ndividuals (Roemer et al. 1994). The San Nicolas Island fox population wa s considered to be at very low Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 15 densities in the early 1970s (Laughrin 1980), and may have reached approximately 500 individuals by 1984 (Kovach and Dow 1985, as cited by Wayne et al. 1991b). Demographic analysis indicated that island fox survival was positively related to the previous year's El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillations (ENSO) events in the drier southern islands and negatively related to current and previous year's ENSO events in the wetter northern islands (Bakker et al. 2009; see Appendix 2). Thus, indirect evidence suggests an effect of climate on island fox survival. C. HISTORICAL POPULATION STATUS AND OBSERVED DECLINES OF ISLAND FOX POPULATIONS The four federally listed island fox subs pecies (San Miguel Island fox, Santa Rosa Island fox, Santa Cruz Island fox, and Sant a Catalina Island fox) all experienced precipitous population declin es in the latter half of the 1990s (see Table 1) (Coonan et al. 2000, 2005c; Roemer 1999; Ro emer et al. 2001b; Timm et al. 2000). Island fox populations on San Miguel, Santa Rosa, and Santa Cruz Islands declined by 90 to 95 percent and, prior to removal of foxes from the wild for captive breeding, were estimated to have a 50 percent chance of extinction over 5 to 10 years (Roemer 1999; Roemer et al. 2001b). Thus, by 1999 researchers considered island fox subspecies on the nor thern Channel Islands to be critically endangered (Coonan et al. 1998; Roemer 1999), as was the Santa Catalina Island subspecies by 2000 (Timm et al. 2000). The decline of island foxe s in the northern Channel Islands is considered a consequence of hyperpredation (Roemer et al. 2001b). The presence of non- native species (feral pigs on Santa Cruz Island and mule deer and elk on Santa Rosa Island) and the absence of bald eagle s enabled golden eagles to colonize the islands successfully and prey heavily on island foxe s, which evolved in the absence of predators. Fox carcass char acteristics that i ndicated golden eagle predation included evisceration , degloving , spinal cord separation, and the presence of golden eagle feathers at ca rcass sites (Roemer et al. 2001b, Coonan et al. 2005c). Additional evidence of eagle pr edation included an increase in golden eagle sightings on the northern Channel Islands, discovery of nesting golden eagles (previously unknown from the Cha nnel Islands), and th e presence of pig and island fox remains in golden eagle nests (Collins and Latta 2006). A mathematical model of hyperpredation s howed that pigs would have been a necessary food source to support a large, resident golden eagle population (Roemer 1999; Roemer et al. 2001b, 2002) and that as few as six golden eagles could have driven the island fox populati ons to the lows recorded during the 1990s. In 1999, prior to golden eagle remova l efforts, there were estimated to be as many as 27 golden eagles on the northe rn Channel Islands (Latta et al. 2005). Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 16 Based on an analysis of extinction like lihood, Roemer (1999) concluded that if mortality and reproduction con tinued at rates similar to those observed just prior to intervention, both the San Miguel Island fox and the Santa Cruz Island fox, and likely the Santa Rosa Island fox, would d ecline to extinction. Successful long- term suppression of golden eagles would lik ely require removal of the non-native prey base (feral pigs removed from Sa nta Cruz Island and deer and elk removed from Santa Rosa Island), as well as the su ccessful restoration of bald eagles to the northern Channel Islands (Coona n 2003; Coonan et al. 2005a). 1. San Miguel Island Laughrin surveyed San Miguel Island f oxes in the early 1970s (Laughrin 1973). Trap success (number of fox captures pe r available trap) was high (43 percent) and Laughrin concluded that island fox popul ations were stable at 2.7 island foxes per km2 (7 per mi2). In the late 1970s, the San Miguel Island fox density averaged 4.6 island foxes per km2 (11.9 per mi2) and the island-wide population was estimated to be 151 to 498 individuals (Collins and Laughrin 1979). In 1993, the NPS began a long-term monitoring program for San Miguel Island foxes, using standardized mark-recaptur e methods (Roemer et al. 1994). Adult density on two grids was 7.8 island foxes per km 2 (20.2 per mi2) and 8.0 island foxes per km2 (20.7 per mi2) in 1993, and the island-wide esti mate was about 300 foxes (Coonan et al. 1998). A third grid was added th e following year. That grid, the Dry Lakebed grid, recorded the highest dens ity then known for island foxes in 1994 (15.9 island foxes per km2 [41.2 per mi2]) and the island-wide estimate rose to 450 adult foxes. Annual monitoring documented a substantia l decline in the Sa n Miguel Island fox population between 1994 and 1999 (Coonan et al. 1998; Coonan et al. 2000; Coonan et al. 2005c), when the estimat ed island-wide population steadily and sharply declined, falling to only 15 adu lts in 1999. In 1999, the NPS brought 14 San Miguel Island foxes into captivity (4 males and 10 females) to initiate a captive breeding program. The only known indivi dual left in the wild at that time, a previously radio-tagged female (C oonan et al. 2005c), was brought into captivity in 2003, but died in December of that year. A necropsy indicated the fox had healed scars on the intercostal muscles between her ribs, suggesting she had survived a predation attempt (Coonan et al. 2004). The cause of the San Miguel Island fox population decline was almost certainly predation by golden eagles (Roemer 1999; Roemer et al. 2001b; Coonan et al. 2005c). During a radio-telemetry stu dy in 1998 and 1999, six of eight collared foxes died within 4 months, four of which were preyed upon by golden eagles (Coonan et al. 2005c). Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 17 2. Santa Rosa Island Laughrin (1980) surveyed the Santa Rosa Island fox population in 1972, reporting a trap success rate of 50.0 percent and a density of 4.2 island foxes per km2 (10.9 per mi2), which coincides with an isla nd-wide population estimate of 898 individuals. No other prev ious data are available for the Santa Rosa Island fox population except for surveys conducted from 1998 to 2000. Based on island size, Roemer et al. (1994) estimated th e island-wide population to be 1,780 adult foxes. More recent trapping data as we ll as anecdotal evidence suggest that the Santa Rosa Island fox population experienced a decline similar to that of the Santa Cruz Island fox and San Miguel Is land fox (Roemer et al. 2001b; Coonan et al. 2005a). Roemer (1999) reported that during 132 trap nights in 1998, only 9 individuals were captured ( 10 total fox captures), for a trap success rate of 7.5 percent. In 2000 and 2001, the NPS brought the remaining 15 wild Santa Rosa Island foxes into captivit y for captive breeding (Coonan and Rutz 2002). No further fox sign was seen on Santa Rosa Island after May 2001 (Coonan et al. 2005a). Given the proximity of Santa Rosa Isla nd to Santa Cruz and San Miguel islands, the concurrent timing of the population d ecline, and the pres ence of golden eagle nests, golden eagle predation was the likely cause of the decline of the Santa Rosa Island fox (Roemer 1999; Roemer et al . 2001b). Golden eagle breeding was confirmed on the island in 2003 (Latta et al. 2005). Both currently and formerly active golden eagle nests were found in two eagle breeding territories, Trap Canyon and Trancion Canyon. Some nests we re used in successive years. Layering of prey remains in the nests indicated that golde n eagles had been successfully breeding (fledgi ng young) on Santa Rosa Is land since as early as 1997, and island fox remains in the lower layers confirmed predation of eagles upon island foxes (Latta et al. 2005; Collins and Latta 2006). The examined nests on Santa Rosa Island did not contain feral pig remain s, indicating that the examined nests were established after pigs were eradicated from the island (post 1992). Examination of golden eagle nest s on Santa Rosa Island found remains of island foxes as well as mule deer fawns, island spotted skunks ( Spilogale gracilis 2001; and Latta 2006). The prevalence of mule deer fawns in the prey remains underscored th eir importance for golden eagle breeding on Santa Rosa Island. Golden eagles are also known to eat carrion and carcasses from the annual cull of deer and elk that occurred in November and December, supporting wintering golden eag les. In addition, fawn av ailability in the spring allowed nesting eagles to successfully fl edge young. The non-native deer and elk (Cervus elaphus ) were managed by the former owners of Santa Rosa Island for a sport-hunting operation. In 2011, large s cale efforts to remove the non-native mule deer and elk on Santa Rosa Island were implemented as part of a court Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 18 settlement (National Parks and Cons ervation Association v. Kennedy, United States District Court for the Central District of Ca lifornia, No. CV 96-7412-WJR (RNBx) to remove the deer and elk by the end of 2011) (NPS 1998). Monitoring in 2013 verified the success of these effo rts and all elk and all but a few deer remained at the end of 2013. The NPS and a cooperator plan to remove any remnant deer. 3. Santa Cruz Island Santa Cruz Island is the largest of the Ch annel Islands and historically supported high densities of island foxes (Laughrin 1973). An early population estimate for the Santa Cruz Island fox was believed to be no more than 3,000 individuals (Laughrin 1971). Between 1973 and 1977, Laughrin (1980) estimated the Santa Cruz Island fox population to be 1,968 indi viduals based on an average density of 7.9 island foxes per km 2 (20.5 per mi2). However, island-wide population estimates extrapolated from annual Santa Cr uz Island fox densities on two grids in 1993 suggest the population decreased from a high of approximately 1,000 to 1,300 foxes (which is believed to be a mo re accurate estimate than previous population estimates; Roemer et al. 1994) to an estimated 55 adults in 2001 (Dennis et al. 2001, 2002), while trapping efficiency was 2.9 percent in 1998 (Roemer 1999). All available evidence indi cates the decline of the Santa Cruz Island fox was caused by golden eagle predation (Roemer 1999; Roemer et al. 2001b). From August 1993 to September 1995, golden eag les were linked to 19 of 21 fox mortalities on the western end of Santa Cr uz Island. Examination of golden eagle nests on Santa Cruz Island found remains of island foxes as well as island spotted skunks ( Spilogale gracilis amphialus ), feral pigs 2001; Collins and Latta 2006). Santa Cruz Island foxes were brought into captivity for breeding in 2002 to provide a \"safety net\" against extinc tion and offspring to supplement the wild population. 4. Santa Catalina Island Santa Catalina Island fox numbers appear to have fluctuated widely over the past 30 years. During surveys from 1972 to 1977, Laughrin (1980) caught only 2 individuals, and trap su ccess was 3.0 percent, a lthough Propst (1975) caught 55 individuals with a trap success rate of 11 percent. Between 1988 and 1991, average density increased, ranging from 2.6 island foxes per km 2 (6.7 per mi2) to 12.7 island foxes per km2 (32.9 per mi2) (Garcelon et al. 1991). The Santa Catalina Island fox population increase d to an estimated 1,342 foxes by 1994 (Roemer et al. 1994). Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 19 The Santa Catalina Island fox population experienced a catastrophic decline of more than 90 percent from 1999 to 2000. Sightings of dead and dying foxes, retrieval of a fox carcass infected with CDV, and confirmation of antibodies against CDV in live foxes suggest this de cline was likely due to the introduction of canine distemper to the Santa Cata lina Island fox population (Timm et al. 2000). The outbreak occurred principally on the large, eastern portion of the island, which is separated by a narrow is thmus from the smaller western end. Trap success on the eastern side of the island dropped from 26.0 percent in 1998 to 1.0 percent in 1999 and 2000, while rema ining stable at approximately 36.0 percent on the western portion. The Sa nta Catalina Island fox population was reduced to perhaps 100 foxes by 2000, mostly on the west end (Timm et al. 2002). Currently, there is considerable concern about the high rate of ceruminous gland carcinoma (ear tumors) in Santa Catalina Island foxes and how it might affect the recovery and long-term viability of the population (Coonan et al. 2010; W. Vickers, Institute for Wildlife Studies. pers. comm. 2014). Santa Catalina Island has a human population of approximately 4,000, a large population of domestic dogs ( Canis familiaris ), and a considerable number of feral cats ( Felis catus ). Santa Catalina Island also has the highest degree of human activity and accessibility of any of the Channel Islands (over 1,000,000 visitors per year). 5. San Clemente Island The earliest density estimate on San Clem ente Island was 4.2 island foxes per km 2 (10.9 per mi2) (Laughrin 1973). Wilson (1976) r ecorded fox density to be 5.7 island foxes per km2 (14.8 per mi2) and island-wide popul ation size to be 2,000 foxes. The San Clemente Island fox population has been monitored annually since 1988 (except for the years 1998 a nd 2006). Population sampling between 1988 and 1991 found densities of 4.8 island foxes per km2 (12.4 per mi2) to 9.1 island foxes per km2 (23.6 per mi2) (Garcelon et al. 1991). Roemer et al. (1994) found similar densities and estimated an island-wide population of 1,003 foxes. However, Garcelon (1999) estimated that the San Clemente Island fox population ranged between 506 and 875 indi viduals from 1989 to 1999. Data from grid trapping indicate that from 1990 to 2000 the San Clemente Island fox population experienced a gradual decl ine from over 800 foxes to fewer than 600, but the population stabilized, if not in creased thereafter, and as of 2004, the population estimate was over 750 foxes (Gar celon 1999, Schmidt et al. 2005a). Densities in 2004 ranged from 2.4 island foxes per km2 (6.2 per mi2) in grassland to 12.6 island foxes per km2 (32.6 per mi2) in scrub/dune habitats (Schmidt et al. 2005a). Concerns about the status of the San Clemente Island population prompted the Navy and the FWS to enter into a Conservation Agreement (2003) Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 20 and undertake proactive measures to unders tand and mitigate potential threats. Since 2004, the population has increase d, and in 2013, the adult population estimate reached 1002 (Bridges et al. 2014). The causes of population fluctuations of foxes on San Clemente Island are unknown; however, predator management activities to protect the federally endangered San Clemente loggerhead shri ke might have been a contributing factor. As part of this program, the Navy initially focused on non-native predators (cats and rats), but in 1999 im plemented control measures for native predators as well, including the San Clem ente Island fox (Department of the Navy 1999). In 1999, the Navy euthanized 13 foxes and relocated 15 to zoos (Garcelon 1999). After 1999, San Clemente Island foxes in San Clemente Island loggerhead shrike breeding territories were shock-coll ared or captured and held in captivity for the duration of the San Clemente Is land loggerhead shrike breeding season. Shock collaring and removal of San Clemente Island foxes to captivity were suspended in 2003. Accidental poisoning from rodenticides used for pest management has also caused San Clemente Island fox mortalities (Munson 2010); however, there are no records of isla nd foxes having been poisoned on other islands. Feral cats exist on the island in high densities (Phillips and Schmidt 1997) and could be competing with San Cl emente Island foxes for prey and may expose them to pathogens. 6. San Nicolas Island Laughrin (1980) reported a density of 0.12 San Nicolas Island fox per km 2 (0.3 per mi2) in 1977, which suggested an island -wide estimate of only 7 animals. Laughrin's reported low trap success rate (4.7 percent) is comparable to the low trap success rates on San Miguel and Santa Rosa Islands at the latter end of the population declines recorded there in the late 1990s. The San Nicolas Island fox population declined to fewe r than 30 individuals in the mid-1970s, coincident with the termination of a supplemental feeding program (Laughrin 1980) and an increase in the feral cat population on the island (Kovach and Dow 1982). Using genetic data, Aguilar et al. (2004) estimat ed that the population had declined to fewer than 10 individuals during the bottl eneck. Following the initiation of a feral cat eradication program in 1980, San Nico las Island fox numbers increased from approximately 120 to 600 foxes in 4 years (Kovach and Dow 1985). Grid densities in 2004 ranged from 8.4 island foxes per km2 (21.8 per mi2) to 20.1 island foxes per km2 (52 per mi2), and the island-wide population was estimated to be 548 foxes (Garcelon and Schm idt 2005). The island-wide population estimate in 2009 was 619 individuals; in 2012 it declined to 4 60 individuals; and in 2013, declined again to 341 individuals (F. Ferrara, U.S. Navy, pers. comm. 2014; Hudgens and Garcelon 2014). Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 21 D. THREATS TO THE SPECIES Section 4(a)(1) of the Act identifies five major categories of threats, which are considered when a species is listed. Th ese are (a) the present destruction, modification, or curtailment of its ra nge, (b) overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes, (c) di sease or predation, (d) the inadequacy of existing regulatory mechan isms, and (e) other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence. Each of these potential categories of threats is analyzed below. Factor A: Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment of the Species' Habitat or Range Although it is difficult to quantify the effect s of past habitat lo ss and/or alteration on the status of island foxe s, habitat on all islands occupied by island foxes has been heavily affected by livestock grazing, cultivation, and other disturbances. A century and a half of overgrazing by non-na tive herbivores (e.g., sheep, goats, deer, elk, cattle, pigs, and horses) has resu lted in substantial impacts to the soils, topography, and vegetation of the islands (Johnson 1980; Coblentz 1980; Clark et al. 1990; Peart et al. 1994; O'Malley 1994) . Much of the native coastal sage scrub, chaparral, and oak woodland ha bitats have been replaced by other vegetation, especially non-native annual grasses (Brumbaugh 1980; Clark et al. 1990; Klinger et al. 1994). Annual grassla nds constitute less preferred habitat for island foxes (Laughrin 1977; Roemer a nd Wayne 2003) and do not provide cover from predators such as golden eagles (Roemer 1999; Roemer et al. 2001b; Coonan et al. 2005c). In 1987, the Califor nia Department of Fish and Game (CDFG), now recognized as California Depa rtment of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW), recommended that the island fox retain its classification as threatened under State law because of continued habitat degr adation from herbivorous mammals on Santa Rosa, Santa Cruz, Santa Catalina, and San Clemente Islands (CDFG 1987). Since that time, non-native species remova l programs have eradicated or reduced the introduced herbivore populations on ma ny of the Channel Islands, including a recent complete removal of over 5,000 feral pigs from Santa Cruz Island (Parkes et al. 2010), and the removal of all elk and all but a few deer from Santa Rosa Island, resulting in an island that is essentially ungulate free (Coonan, pers. comm. 2014). On Catalina Island, all but one pig and three female goats have been removed resulting in an island that is essentially pig and goat free (Garcelon et al. 2005, King, Santa Cata lina Island Conservancy, pe rs. comm. 2014). On San Nicholas Island, feral cats were recently removed (Hanson 2012). Although some plant species have increased in number following the removal of non-native herbivores and omnivores from the islands, other aspects of recovery of the native habitats can be slow (H ochberg et al. 1979). In particular, community composition can be altered by the spread of non-native plants that Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 22 were able to gain a foothold during th e period of disturbance. These non-native species continue to invade and modify island fox habitat resulting in lower diversity of vegetation, less diverse habitat structure, and reduced food availability. At present, habitat degr adation by herbivores continues only on Santa Catalina Island, primarily by bison. However, effects from past grazing activity, such as loss of tops oil or spread of non-native species, continue to occur on all islands. Habitat modi fication also occurs as a result of facilities or recreational development. Although it is possible that th ese habitat changes may have affected island foxes at some point in the past, populations re mained relatively st able prior to the commencement of golden eagle predation in the mid-1990s and disease in 1999. Also, habitat alteration has not been a hi ndrance to the rapid r ecovery of the fox that has taken place. Factor B: Overutilization for Comme rcial, Recreational, Scientific, or Educational Purposes Island foxes were used in the past for pelts and ceremonial uses by Native Americans (Collins 1991b); however, this is no longer occurring. Therefore, island foxes are not currently exploited for commercial, recreationa l, scientific, or educational purposes. However, scientis ts are continually performing recovery efforts through FWS-issued 10(a)(1)(A) recovery permits. These research activities are not known to be a threat to island foxes. Factor C: Disease or Predation Disease Island foxes are vulnerable to canine and other diseases. The catastrophic population decline of Sant a Catalina Island foxes during 1999 to 2000 was caused by CDV; probably vectored to the island by a raccoon ( Procyon lotor ) (Timm et al. 2009). Analysis of CDV isolated from a Santa Catalina Is land fox indicated it to be most closely related to the CDV strain found in mainland raccoons (Coonan et al. 2010; Timm et al. 2009) and a number of stowaway raccoons have been recently removed from Santa Catalina Island (Coonan 2013). Disease remains a concern for Santa Catalina Island foxes, since the island has high accessibility and a sizable human population. All island fox populations have been surveyed for CDV, canine parvovirus, canine adenovirus, canine herpes virus, canine corona leptospirosis, and toxoplasmosis 1999; Roemer et al. 2001b; Clifford et al. 2006). An tibodies against can ine parvovirus and canine adenovirus are highly prevalent in most island fox populations, with the prevalence differing between islands and years (Garcelon et al. 1992; Coonan et Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 23 al. 2000; Roemer et al. 2001b; Clifford et al. 2006). Differences may be explained in part by differences in test sensitivities in the labs used for these surveys; the most recent survey used a la b with the most sensitive tests (Clifford et al. 2006). This recent survey in dicated that Santa Catalina Island fox subspecies apparently has no protection agai nst canine adenovirus (Clifford et al. 2006). The recent finding of ear tumors in Santa Catalina Island foxes, confirmed to be a source of mortality in wild foxes, is of high enough frequency to be considered a concern (Coonan et al. 2010). The ear in flammation associated with cancer in Santa Catalina Island foxes may be due in part to Otodectes mite infections (Schwemm 2008). Treatment with aracicide may reduce the incidence of ear mite infection and thus inflammation (Coonan 2011). The disease risk that domestic cats pose to island foxes is unclear. Pathogen sharing between island foxes and cats is mi nimal, but not absent (Clifford et al. 2006). A Santa Catalina Island fox morta lity was known to be infected with Toxoplasma sp., an infectious agent that may have been acquired from cats (Timm et al. 2009). Infection with CDV in cats has been previously reported (Appel et al. 1974; Ikeda et al. 2001), a nd infected cats are capable of shedding CDV into the environment (Munson 2010). Two cats from Santa Catalina Island with CDV antibodies were also seropos itive for feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukemia virus (FeLV), which make cats more vulnerable to other diseases and increases sheddi ng of disease organisms, including toxoplasmosis ( and Mullins 1991; Pedersen and Barlough 1991; Lin et al. 1992). Is land foxes may be exposed to T. gondii oocysts shed in cat feces, in addition to the tissue cysts in prey items (Tenter et al. 2000). Toxoplasma has been documented to cause mortality in dogs (Dubey et al. 1989) and a Santa Catalina Island fox (M unson 2010). Concurrent distemper and T. gondii infection is associated with a high level of mortality in gray foxes (Davidson et al. 1992; Kelly and Sleema n 2003) and domestic dogs (Brito et al. 2002; Moretti et al. 2006). Although caliciviruses have been shown to infect a variety of hosts and could possibly be passed between cats and foxe s (Smith et al. 1998), calicivirus exposure is not correlated among foxes a nd cats, and presence of calicivirus antibodies in foxes on islands without cats suggests this interaction is not necessary for fox infection (Clifford et al. 2006). Although competition with cats is likely a more pressing threat to th e island fox, the presence of cats on San Clemente and Santa Catalina Islands may in itiate or help propagate an infectious disease epidemic, as pathogens such as distemper and rabies could circulate among these sympatric carnivores (Cliffo rd et al. 2006). Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 24 Other mammals are a potential source of pathogens for island foxes, such as bats infected with rabies. Although rabies has never been found in island wildlife, if it were to occur, it would be difficult to e ffectively mitigate an outbreak. Hence the only defenses are a vaccination program a nd a subset of each fox subspecies are vaccinated against rabies. Predation On the northern Channel Isla nds, golden eagle predation was the primary threat to island foxes from the mid-1990s until 2007 (Coonan et al. 2005a; Coonan et al. 2010, Coonan 2013). Golden eagle predation was the cause of 13 of 15 mortalities of wild-born a nd released island foxes on San Miguel and Santa Rosa Islands from 2003 to 2005 (Coonan and Schwemm 2009). Golden eagle predation accounted for 69 of 92 Santa Cruz Island fox mortalities from December 2000 through June 2007 (Schmidt et al. 2007; R. Wolstenholme, The Nature Conservancy, pers. comm. 2007). The onset of golden eagle predation resu lted in the population decline of Santa Cruz Island foxes as demonstrated by the de crease in annual survivorship from 83 percent in 1994 to 39 per cent in 1995 (Roemer et al . 2001b). San Miguel Island fox survivorship was 12 percent from 1998 to 1999, the tail end of the decline (Coonan et al. 2005c). As golden eagle s were removed from the northern Channel Islands, annual Santa Cruz Isla nd fox survivorship increased to 80 percent by 2003, a level that was previously estimate d by demographic modeling to be the minimum necessary for recove ry (Miller et al. 2001; Coonan et al. 2005a). Survival rates on Santa Cruz Island have remained above 90 percent since 2011 (C. Boser, The Nature Conservancy, pers. comm. 2014; Coonan 2014). There are a number of resident domestic dogs in the interior of Santa Catalina Island and in the leeward coves and cam ps, many within active island fox territories as well as in th e city of Avalon and the town of Two Harbors. In 2005, two deadly interactions occurred be tween Santa Catalin a Island foxes and domestic dogs (IWS 2006; King, Santa Ca talina Island Conservancy, pers. comm. 2014). Factor D: Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms As identified above, the primary causes of the island fox population declines were attributed to the unprecedented and u nnatural levels of predation by golden eagles, the spread of canine distempe r through the Santa Catalina Island fox subspecies, and the degradation of hab itat by introduced herbivores. Federal, State, and local laws have not been suffi cient to prevent island fox declines from these causes. Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 25 In 1971, the State of California listed th e island fox as rare (a designation later changed to threatened), which means that either an incidental take permit is required under the California Endanger ed Species Act (Section 2081(b)) for otherwise lawful projects or a scientific collecting permit/research memorandum of understanding (Section 2081( a)) is required to take, collect, capture, mark, or salvage for scientific, educational, an d non-commercial propagation purposes. State law does not require Federal agencies to avoid or compensate for impacts to the island fox and its habitat. No regulatory mechanisms have been sp ecifically designed for the protection of the four listed island fox subspecies, ex cept for prohibitions against bringing pets ashore within Channel Islands Nati onal Park. Section 2.15 of the superintendent's compendium prohibits pets from all NPS islands, except for guide dogs for visually impaired persons. However, dogs have been used to eradicate pigs from Santa Rosa a nd Santa Cruz Islands, albeit with implementation of stringent quarantine pr ocedures. Prohibitions against bringing dogs ashore are difficult to enforce (e.g., boaters have been observed bringing pets onshore to all three northern Channel Islands with island fox populations) (P. Schuyler, Independent Biologist, pers. co mm. 2006). There is no prohibition of mainland animal visitation to Santa Cata lina Island, and there is no requirement for health certification for dogs coming to the island, where the most tourist traffic and private residents occur, thus increas ing the risk of exposing Santa Catalina Island foxes to disease. On Santa Ro sa Island, the special use permit for the commercial hunting operation allowed for island-resident employees of the permittee to have \"ranch dogs\" on the is land, though that practice ended in 2011 with the expiration of the permit and cessa tion of hunting activities (Coonan, pers. comm. 2014). Several Federal laws apply to the mana gement of NPS and Navy lands. These laws and guidelines include the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the Endangered Species Act. The NPS management is further dictated by Department of the Interior policies a nd NPS policies and guidelines, including NPS guidelines for natural resource s management (NPS 1991), the Channel Islands National Park General Management Plan (NPS 1985), and the NPS Organic Act (16 U.S.C. 1, 2, 3, and 4). Bo th the NPS and the Navy have adequate authority to manage the land and ac tivities under their administration for conservation of the island fox (e.g., feral animal removal). In addition to removing golden eagles, their prey ba se must be removed to prevent recolonization. Feral pigs have been re moved from Santa Cruz Island, and all the elk and all but a few deer have been removed from Santa Rosa Island, with complete removal of the few remaining deer likely by early 2014. San Miguel Island is owned by the Navy, but the NPS has responsibility for management of the natural, historic, and scientific resources of San Miguel Island Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 26 through a Memorandum of Agreement (M OA) originally signed in 1963, an amendment signed in 1976, and a suppl emental Interagency Agreement (IA) signed in 1985. The MOA states that the \"paramount use of the islands and their environs shall be for th e purpose of a missile test range, and all activities conducted by, or in behalf of, the Departme nt of the Interior on such islands, shall recognize the priority of such use\" (Depar tment of the Navy 1963). In addition to San Miguel Island, Santa Cruz Island and Sa nta Rosa Island lie wholly within the Navy's Pacific Missile Test Center (PMTC) Sea Test Range. The 1985 IA provides for PMTC to have access to and use of portions of those islands, for expeditious processing of any necessary pe rmits by the NPS, and for mitigation of damage to NPS resources from any such activity (Department of the Navy 1985). To date, conflicts concerning protection of sensitive resources on San Miguel Island have not occurred. Federal protection of golden eagles by th e Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act of 1962, as amended, has increased th e golden eagle population in mainland California (B. Walton, Santa Cruz Predatory Bird Re search Group, pers. comm. 2004), and golden eagles have expanded their range. The protections extended to golden eagles limit management alternativ es; removal of golden eagles requires a depredation permit from the FWS and leth al removal has not been authorized. Such a permit would allow golden eagles to be taken by firearms, traps, or other suitable means except by poison or from aircraft (50 CFR 22. 23). A California State law (California Fish and Wildlife Code, section 3511) passed in 2003 allows the take of golden eagles and several othe r \"fully protected\" species, after a 30- day public notice period, for the purpose of recovering endangered species. Regulatory mechanisms relevant to contro l of feral cats are discussed in the section on feral cats below. Factor E: Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting its Continued Existence Several other factors, including climat e change, competition from introduced species, stochastic environmental factors and road mortalities may have negative effects on island foxes and their habitats. Climate change Climate change was not included as a threat in the listing rule for the island foxes (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2004). Current climate change predictions for terrestrial areas in the Northern Hemis phere indicate warmer air temperatures, more intense precipitation events, and increased summer continental drying (Field et al. 1999, Cayan et al. 2005, IPCC 2007). It is unknown at this time if climate change in California will result in a warmer trend w ith localized drying, higher Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 27 precipitation events, or other effects, and predictions of climatic conditions for smaller sub-regions, let alone small o ffshore islands, remains uncertain. Competition with feral cats The CDFG, in recommending the retention of the threatened classification of the island fox under State law, cited the presence of competition with feral cats on Santa Catalina Island (CDFG 1987). Feral cats weigh on average twice as much as island foxes and may negatively aff ect foxes through direct aggression, predation on young, competition for food resources, and disease transmission (Laughrin 1978). Direct aggression between foxes and cat s has been documented in the wild, primarily near leased coves and campgr ounds that provide food and shelter (D. Guttilla, Santa Catalina Island Conservancy, pers. comm. 2007). On Santa Catalina Island, frequent cap ture of cats in canyon bottoms and island foxes higher on slopes (Propst 1975) was attributed to competition and displacement of foxes by cats. On San Nicolas Island , where feral cat and island fox diets overlapped by 80 percent, foxes were ab sent from areas w ith cat densities exceeding 4 cats per km 2 (10 per mi2) (Kovach and Dow 1982; Phillips et al. 2007). After a large number of feral cat s were removed from San Nicolas Island, foxes moved into areas previously occ upied by cats (Laughrin 1978; Kovach and Dow 1982). California State law (Food and Agricu ltural Code 31752.5) prohibits lethal control of feral cats unless cats are held for a minimum of 3 days. On Santa Catalina Island, this law could prevent th e CIC from controlling or managing feral cats on the interior of the island, as it does not have adequate facilities to hold cats. The multiple ownership of the island further complicates the application of regulations and other strategies to addr ess the resident feral cat population on the island. A Feral Animal Task Force c onvened by the City of Avalon, with representatives of the CIC and other isla nd stakeholders, is working to address feral and free-ranging cats in the city and on the rest of the island. San Clemente Island, the other island with feral cats, is under federal jurisdiction, and thus is not bound by this State law. Feral cats we re recently removed from San Nicolas Island (Hanson 2012). Lack of genetic variation and st ochastic environmental factors As a population becomes genetically homoge neous, its susceptibility to disease, parasites, and extinction increases (O'Bri en and Evermann 1988) as its ability to evolve and adapt to environmental change is diminished (Templeton 1994). The four listed island fox subspecies have all su ffered large declines and are at risk of having reduced or low genetic diversity due to the population bottlenecks they have experienced (San Miguel Island f ox: Gray 2002; Gray et al. 2001; San Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 28 Nicolas Island fox: Gilbert et al. 1990; Wayne et al. 1991a; Go ldstein et al. 1999) (see Biological Information section fo r more complete discussion, p. 7). However, it should be noted that, al though island foxes have little genetic variability and lost more during the recent decline, they are probably tolerant of low genetic variation, occasional bottlen ecks, and higher inbreeding (Coonan et al. 2010). The extremely small population sizes of the San Miguel Island fox and Santa Rosa Island fox made them vulnerable to extinction. Island endemics have a high extinction risk due to isolation and sm all population sizes (M acArthur and Wilson 1967), both of which make them more vulne rable to stochastic events such as drought or wildfires (Miller et al. 2001; Kohlman et al. 2005 ). In addition, lack of genetic variation may make a population less capable of overcoming stochastic events and the relationship between stocha stic events and low genetic diversity can become synergistic . Therefore, the interrela tionship between demographic risk (stochasticity) and geneti c risk (low genetic diversity ) can increase the risk of extinction. Road mortalities The lack of fear of human activities in wild island foxes coupled with relatively high levels of vehicle traffic on the southe rn Channel Islands re sult in a number of vehicle collisions each year. Death from vehicle collision on roads is the largest known source of mortality on San Nicola s and San Clemente Islands, accounting for approximately 17 island fox mortalities annually on San Nicolas Island (F. Ferrara, U.S. Navy. pers. comm. 2014) and a minimum of 26 foxes per year between the years 1991 and 1995 on San Clem ente Island (Garcelon 1999). In 2013, 43 foxes died from vehicular trauma (Bridges et al. 2014). On Santa Catalina Island, annual averages of four f oxes per year were killed by vehicles from 2003 to 2007 (Schmidt et al. 2004; Schmidt et al. 2005b; IWS 2006; IWS 2007; King and Duncan 2008), but the number of foxes killed has increased in the past several years as the fox numbers have increased: in 2011, 16 foxes were killed by vehicles, and in 2013, 12 foxe s were killed by vehicles (King and Duncan 2013). Vehicle collisions on the northern Channel Islands are less common due to low traffic volume and r ough dirt roads, which reduce vehicle speed. Competition with deer and pigs for food items Deer and elk consume fruits that are also preferred by island foxes. For example, mule deer and elk on Santa Rosa Island have been known to heavily browse the federally endangered Santa Rosa Island manzanita ( Arctostaphylos confertiflora ), the fruits of which have been found in island fox feces (Coonan, pers. comm. 2011). Similarly, pigs consume a variety of plant and animal items that are also Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 29 used by island foxes. Recent feral ungul ate removal programs on both Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa Islands have removed this source of competition, with the exception of a few remaining deer on Santa Rosa Island. 1. Summary of Listing Factors A through E Listing Factor A, the present or th reatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of habitat or range, was not c onsidered a substantia l threat at listing. However, habitat modification, in the form of conversion of sh rublands to alien annual grasslands by grazing, facilitated predation by golden ea gles by decreasing cover available to island foxes. Additionally, habitat alteration has and continues to occur from vegetation type conversion, development, and/or fire. Thus, introducing measures and practices to main tain habitat integrity is recommended for attaining the long-term conservati on of the island fox (see LONG-TERM CONSERVATION STRATEGY). Listing Factor B, overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes, was not considered a threat at the time of listing and is not consid ered a threat at this time. The primary threats to the island fox are encompassed within Listing Factor C, pertaining to disease or predation. Predation by golden eagles was one of the primary threats to the island fox at the time of listing and although stil l considered to be a threat to island fox populations on the northern Cha nnel Islands, the degr ee of this threat has been decreased as a result of ongoing management practices. At the time of listing it was noted that a disease outbreak is believed to be the cause of the Santa Catalina Island fox population decline. Island fox populations will always be at risk of a disease outbreak, especially on Santa Catalina Island; however, the risk potential for disease outbreak can be a nd has been reduced. Listing Factor D, inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanis ms, were not considered to be reasons for island fox decline at time of listing but were identified to have impeded or precluded the implementation of island fox recovery efforts, including The Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act of 1962, as amended, California Fish and Game Code, section 3511, and California Food and Agricultural Code 31752.5. However, successful recovery strategi es have been developed within the constraints of these regulatory controls . Listing Factor E, including climate change, competition from introduced speci es, stochastic environmental factors, and road mortality may have negative effects on island foxes and their habitats. E. RECOVERY AND CONSERVATION EFFORTS 1. Recovery Actions for List ed Island Fox Subspecies Recent island fox recovery efforts to date have included efforts to ameliorate the impact of golden eagle predation on the three island fox subsp ecies that occur on the northern Channel Islands and disease on Santa Catalin a Island foxes. All of Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 30 these efforts have included captive breeding of island foxes to increase each of the four subspecies' populations to viable levels. Northern Channel Islands In April 1999, the Island Fox Working Group concluded that: Predation by golden eagles was the pr imary mortality factor acting on the island fox populations; Disease or parasites may have compo unded the effects of predation; and The size of each of these three island fox populations was critically small and natural reproductive potential and recruitment were low. At the time, the group agreed that estab lishing an island fox sa nctuary and captive breeding program was necessary to safegua rd individuals and to augment natural recruitment into the population. The NPS began initiating emergency actio ns in 1999. The objectives were to remove the primary mortality factor affecting island foxes (golden eagle predation), and to recover island fox popul ations to viable levels via captive breeding. The NPS' island fox rec overy strategy (Coonan 2003) utilized demographic modeling (Miller et al. 2001) to set the program size and determine the augmentation schedule for captive breeding. To achieve desired annual augmentation rates, the model estimated that an on-island ca ptive population of 20 breeding pairs would be required. Removal of Golden Eagles Golden eagle translocation from the northern Channel Islands commenced in summer 1999. Golden eagles were trapped and subsequently released in northeastern California. Satellite teleme try affixed to the first 12 translocated golden eagles confirmed that none of the relocated eagles attempted to return to the islands for the 1.5 year life of the transmitter. Between November 1999 and July 2006, 44 golden eagles, including 22 adults or near adults, were removed from Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa Islands (Latta et al. 2005; Coonan et al. 2010). Most adult a nd subadult eagles were trapped using a radio-controlled bow net set over dead or live bait (Jackman et al. 1994). Two helicopter net-gunning operations (O'Gar a and Getz 1986) on Santa Cruz Island in June and October 2002 failed to capture any golden eagles, due to the difficulty in forcing eagles to ground in the ru gged topography and dense vegetation. Ten nestlings were removed by hand from seven different nests (five from Santa Cruz Island and two from Santa Rosa Island) a nd fostered into mainland golden eagle nests or released via hacking . By mid-2005, seven golden eagles were estimated to remain on the northern Channel Islands, and the removal efforts were yielding Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 31 diminishing returns. In June 2006, a pair of nesting golden eagles was successfully captured via a net-gun from a helicopter using improved equipment and methods. This pair was removed fr om Santa Cruz Island and their single chick was removed from the nest by hand (Coonan et al. 2010). These represent the last eagles captured and removed from the islands. Since 2006, two golden eagle predation events occurred where multiple individuals were preyed upon. In early 2007, 10 radio-collared foxes died from eagle predation on Santa Cruz Island, though helicopter and ground surveys failed to locate any golden eagles. In winte r-spring 2010, 7 radio- collared foxes died from predation on Santa Rosa Island; tw o golden eagle sightings were recorded on Santa Rosa Island in that time peri od, and feathers coll ected at three fox mortality sites were identified as golden eagle feathers (Coonan and Guglielmino 2012). As on Santa Cruz, helicopter survey s failed to locate any golden eagles. Genetic analysis of the f eathers confirmed their golde n eagle origin, and further identified them as coming from three highly-related individua ls, likely juvenile sibling eagles (Talbot et al., in prep.). With the exception of the two scenarios described above, eagle predation on northern Channel Island foxes has been al most negligible since 2006. Island fox annual survival has remained above 90 percent for most of that period, and populations have steadily incr eased. Any predation has been short-term in nature and has likely been the result of dispersi ng, juvenile or sub-a dult eagles; no adult golden eagles have attempte d nesting on the northern Ch annel Islands (Coonan et al. 2010). Nesting adult golden eagles pres ent a higher threat to foxes, because eagle energetic requirement s during breeding are high a nd are satisfied by the delivery of small prey items to the ne st (as opposed to carrion) (Coonan et al. 2010). Other golden eagle genetic work suppor ts the long-term success of eagle translocation efforts. Sonsthagen et al. (2012) investigated the genetics of mainland golden eagles and those translocat ed from the islands, finding that the island population was likely th e result of one colonizat ion event. The likelihood of another successful golden eagle col onization is low, given changes in non- native prey availability (see belo w) and monitoring/mitigation by land management agencies. Island fox recovery may ultimately depend on promoting ecological conditions that dissuade golden eagle use of the Ch annel Islands, includ ing maintaining the islands free of non-native herbivores and restoring bald eagle s to the northern Channel Islands. In 2005-2006, 5,036 feral pigs were remove d from Santa Cruz Island, with no individuals known to be remaining on the island (Macdonald and Walker 2007; Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 32 Morrison et al. 2007). In 2011, removal of the non-native mule deer and elk on Santa Rosa Island was implemented as part of a court settleme nt (NPS 1998). Elk were quickly removed and as of 2014, all but a few mule deer had been removed from Santa Rosa Island. Thus, in 2014, the northern islands were effectively ungulate-free for the first time since the mid-19th Century. The recent, successful restoration of bald eagles to the Channel Islands may also provide a deterrent to future golden eagl e colonization of the islands. Sixty-one bald eagles were released on Santa Cr uz Island as the result of annual experimental reintroductions of juven ile bald eagles from 2002 to 2006 (Coonan et al. 2010). By 2013, there were estim ated to be at least 40 bald eagles occupying Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, a nd Anacapa Islands. In spring 2006, two bald eagle pairs established nests on Santa Cruz Island, and each successfully fledged a single chick (Coonan et al. 2010) . These breeding pa irs represented the first active and successful bald eagle ne sts on the northern Ch annel Islands since the late 1950s (Kiff 1980). In 2013 there were 8 breeding pairs of bald eagles on the northern Channel Islands, and 6 young we re fledged from their nests (Sharpe 2014). Captive Breeding The critically low island fox populations on the northern Channel Islands and on Santa Catalina Island in 1999/2000, prompt ed management agencies to begin captive breeding on each of the islands where federally listed subspecies occurred. Captive breeding was conducted on each is land, rather than on the mainland, due to the potential for vectoring pathogens to the islands by animals raised in mainland facilities. Island foxes had never been bred in captivity before, and so island managers and others worked with the zoo community and drew from other captive canid programs to develop all as pects of island fox husbandry: pen size and shape, diet, breeding strategies, vete rinary care, and release methods (Coonan et al. 2010). Island foxes br ed successfully in captivit y on all islands (see below), though the programs encountered obstacles such as stress, male aggression, female abandonment and an outbreak of mastitis, all of which reduced reproductive success and prompted research and adjustment in captive breeding methods. Cessation of captive breeding and reintroduction 10 years after the programs began speaks to the program's success; by the program's end, reproduction in the reintroduced wild populations was outp acing that in captivity. Upon receiving recommendations from a panel of experts in 1999, the NPS began captive breeding on San Miguel Island in the summer of 1999, with construction of pens and capture of wild island fo xes for captive propagation. By January 2000, 14 island foxes had been captured and placed in the pens; the remaining wild fox was captured in 2001. Four of the captured foxes were males and were paired with four females for breeding, and 8 of the 15 potential founders Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 33 eventually bred in captivity. In 2004, af ter five years of breeding, the San Miguel Island fox captive population had increased to 50 animals, exceeding the target captive population size of 40 animals and allowing initia l releases back to the wild in fall 2004. The San Miguel Island fox captive breeding and reintroduction program ended in 2007, due to high reproducti ve success and survival in the wild. During 9 years of captive breeding, 53 pups were born in captivity, and 62 foxes released to the wild. The recovering wild population steadily increased since releases began in 2004 (Coonan and Schwemm 2009; Coonan et al. 2010). A captive breeding program was initiated for Santa Rosa Island in 2000. The initial captive population on Santa Rosa Is land was 15 animals, which proved to be the island's remaining fox population. Some females were pregnant when captured, and three litters we re born in captivity in 2000. With an increase to 56 foxes in 2003, the captive population on Santa Rosa Island exceeded the target captive population size of 40 foxes, and initial releases began in winter 2003/2004. Annual releases continue d through 2008, after which captive breeding was ceased on Santa Rosa Island. In 9 years of captive breeding, 87 pups were born in captivity, and 93 foxes (i ncluding some of the foxes originally brought into captivity) were released to the wild (Coonan et al. 2010). Captive breeding was also conducted on Sa nta Cruz Island as a joint venture by the NPS and TNC. The status of eag les and foxes on Santa Cruz Island was assessed at the 2001 meeting of the Is land Fox Conservation Working Group, and consensus was that captive breeding wa s warranted. In February 2002, a 10-pen captive breeding facility was built on Sa nta Cruz Island by the NPS and TNC. Between 2001 and 2003 this facility was stocked with 18 adult island foxes caught as known pairs or i ndividuals from separate areas of the island. Captive- born pups of breeding pairs were releas ed in 2002 and 2003, but experienced high mortality and were pulled back into cap tivity in 2004. A sec ond facility with 27 pens was added in 2004 to accommodate cap tive born individuals (Schmidt et al. 2007). No releases occurred in 2004 or 2005, and the captive population grew to 62 animals in 2005. After capturing the last breeding golden eagle pair in June 2006, releases of captive indi viduals began in July 2006 and concluded in July 2008 (Hudgens and Sanchez 2009). On Santa Catalina Island, captive bree ding was developed by IWS, funded by the CIC (see below). Parasites Parasites have not specifical ly been considered a dis ease threat to wild island foxes; however, parasite burdens in captiv e individuals were a cause of concern. For this reason, fecal parasite surveys were conducted for captive foxes on San Miguel, Santa Rosa, and Santa Cruz Isla nds as part of a risk assessment for treating endoparasites in captive island foxes (C oonan, pers. comm. 2011). A Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 34 panel convened by USGS-BRD for a risk assessment (Sohn and Thomas 2005) determined that there was little clinical justification for the widespread use of anthelmintics in island foxes, given that non-ta rget parasites might be killed by these drugs, with dire consequences for treated foxes. The panel compiled a list of preferred anthelmintics, recommended dosages, and contraindications , should treatment for internal parasites be required. Canine heartworm ( Dirofilaria immitis ) was suspected to be a threat to island foxes because positive Dirofilaria antigen tests were docum ented in four of the six island fox subspecies (San Miguel Island Fox, Santa Cruz Island fox, Santa Rosa Island fox, and San Nicolas Island fox) (Roemer et al. 2000). However, necropsies of over 400 island foxes from all islands have found no evidence of heartworm or heartworm disease (Muns on 2010; Coonan et al. 2010). In fact, these results suggest tests for Dirofilaria antigen are not specific and possibly cross-react with another pa rasite antigen, and given th e geographic distribution of Dirofilaria antigen-positive foxes with Spirocerca infections, cross-reaction with Spirocerca antigens by these tests is very likely (Coonan et al. 2010). In 2013, necropsies of five radio-colla red San Miguel Island foxes revealed substantial, and in several cases ma ssive, parasitism by an unidentified Acanthocephalan (spiny-headed) parasite in the intestines (Coonan 2014). The parasite burdens were associated with colitis, enteritis and emaciation, and likely contributed to mortality of the i ndividuals. Acanthocephalans, which occasionally cause mortality in sea otters ( Enhydra lutris ), have not been previously recorded in island foxes. Disease Island foxes are thought to be vulnerable to canine and other diseases. The catastrophic decline on Sa nta Catalina was caused by CDV (Timm et al. 2009). Therefore, proactive and ongoing mitigation for disease is being implemented for island foxes. Island foxes on all island s are vaccinated against CDV and rabies, the two diseases for which active mitigation measures could not be implemented in a timely manner once an outbreak was detected. The number of foxes vaccinated on each island is generally the number required to start a captive breeding program (75-100), were the populat ion to be affected by an epidemic (see Appendix A in Coonan 2011, and Appe ndix 3 and 4 of this plan). Epidemic response plans, which are require d for delisting (see Recovery Criteria) are being developed for each island fox subsp ecies and represent a critical tool in disease mitigation. The plans provide gui delines to ensure diseases, even novel ones, are appropriately detected and m itigated. Detection is primarily by maintaining a sample of radio-collar ed, unvaccinated sentinel animals and monitoring them for mortality signals at least once a week. When a mortality Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 35 signal is detected, carcasse s are retrieved and sent for necropsy to determine mortality cause and possible presence of dis ease. If a disease is detected, decision trees and the use of the incident command system guide selection and implementation of appropriate responses. An epidemic response plan has been developed for San Clemente Island (Hudgens et al. 2011), and plans are currently being developed for the northern Cha nnel Islands and Sa nta Catalina Island (Hudgens et al. 2013; Hudgens et al., in prep.). Mon itoring of radio-collared foxes for survival rate and mortality cause is currently being conducted for five of the six island fox subspecies (Coonan 2013) . Serology is conducted at least once every 5 years on each fox subspecies to de tect presence of antibodies to various diseases. The results indicate wide variation among the six subspecies in seroprevalence to CDV, canin e adenovirus, canine parvovi rus, canine herpes virus and canine coronavirus (Coonan et al. 2010). None of the seroprevalence values were associated with population decline. The relatively high seroprevalence of canine parvovirus and canine adenovirus in some island fox populations without accompanying mortality suggests that th ese viruses are endemic and of low pathogenicity in island foxes (Munson 2010). Radio-telemetry monitoring as well as in formation from annual trapping efforts have revealed the occurren ce of other diseases in island foxes. These include toxoplasma and ceruminous gland tumors (in Santa Catalina Island foxes), leptospirosis (in Santa Rosa Island foxe s), 2012). Ceruminous gland tumors occur in the ear canals of one third of adult foxes on Santa Catalina Island, and are associated with seve re inflammation and the presence of ear mites. Experimental treatment of mites with ivermectin has reduced inflammation in fox ears on the island (Coonan 2011). Guidelines for vaccination (Appendix 4), pr eparation of epidemic response plans, regular serosurveys and collection of othe r biomaterials, and quarantine protocols for dogs or foxes moved between Sant a Cruz, Santa Rosa, San Miguel, San Clemente, and San Nicolas Islands (Appendi x 6) have all been developed by the Fox Health Group of the Island Fox C onservation Working Group (Munson 2010; Coonan 2010, 2011, 2012). Santa Catalina Island In response to the catastr ophic Santa Catalina Island fox decline that was due to CDV, the CIC, which owns and manages 88 percent of the island, contracted with the IWS to develop and implement island fox recovery actions between 1999 and 2005. Beginning in 2006, CIC assumed full responsibility for Santa Catalina Island fox conservation efforts. CIC and IWS implemented the following f our recovery actions (Kohlmann et al. 2005): Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 36 1. Intensive mark-recapture sampling to estimate Santa Catalina Island fox population size after the decline was detected; 2. Translocation of juvenile Santa Ca talina Island foxes from the dense population on the western end of the is land to the eastern end, where foxes had been essentially extirpated; 3. Vaccination of nearly the entire Santa Catalina Island fox population against CDV following trials of vaccin e safety and efficacy using captive individuals; and 4. A captive breeding program to augmen t the Santa Catalina Island fox population. In 2001 and 2002, 22 juvenile Santa Catalina Island foxes were tr anslocated from the west end of the island to the east e nd. Survival of these individuals was very high; in 2004, at least 77 pe rcent (n=17) of the transloc ated foxes were known to be alive, with at least 6 individuals reproducing in thei r new locations (Coonan et al. 2010). Nearly 50 percent of the transl ocated foxes started reproducing in their new locations within a year of being moved. The gray fox, a close relative of the isla nd fox is known to be highly susceptible to CDV and modified live CDV vaccines (Hal lbrooks et al. 1981). As a result of this susceptibility, trials were conducte d on captive Santa Catalina Island foxes and demonstrated that a new recombin ant vaccine (Merial Purevax Ferret\u00ae, Merial, Inc., Athens, GA) was both sa fe and induced antibody production. Following these trials, vaccination of wild Santa Catalina Island foxes began in 2000 (Timm et al. 2000), and currently a ll six island fox subspecies (including two non-federally listed subspecies) are vaccinated against CDV (Coonan et al. 2010). In 2000, the CIC in conjunction with IWS established a captive breeding program for Santa Catalina Island foxes. Between 2000 and 2002, 27 Santa Catalina Island foxes were brought into captivity. From 2001 to 2004, 79 individuals were released from captivity, in cluding 37 captive-born pups and 20 of the original wild-captured adults. Survival of captive- born pups was very high (Schmidt et al. 2005b). In 2003, the first wild pup was born to a released captive-born individual (Clifford 2006). Reproduction by released individuals has continued and both translocated and captive-bred foxes have formed pairs with each other and with resident wild foxes. Based on the high su rvival (75 percent) of foxes released from 2001 to 2003, and the natural productiv ity of foxes in th e wild, the captive breeding effort on Santa Ca talina Island was terminat ed after the 2004 breeding season. Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 37 Although wildlife biologists and conservationists have recommended removal of feral cats from Santa Catalina Is land for decades (Anon 1931; Propst 1975; Collins and Martin 1985; Menke and Mill er 1985; S. Sillett, Smithsonian Center, Wa shington, D.C., pers. comm. 2004; Backlin et al. 2005; Clifford et al. 2006), there is still no l ong-term, island-wide feral cat management program on Santa Catalina Island. For the last 20 years, the local humane society has practiced trap-neuter-release in Avalon and Two Harbors, where cats are maintained in unconfined feeding colonies ranging from 5 to 75 cats each. These colonies attract reproductively intact cats from surrounding wildland areas and serve as disposal sites for unwanted pets (Guttilla 2007). During the annual Santa Ca talina Island fox trapping efforts from 2004 to 2007, feral cats that were captured incidentally were tested for feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (F IV). Diseased cats were euthanized and healthy cats were sterilized, pit-tagge d, and vaccinated for rabies (Guttilla and Stapp 2010). The CIC has continued to co llect data on disease prevalence, diet, and feral cat distribution across the isla nd; however, the low trapping-success-rate and difficulty in detecting feral cats has precluded the ability to accurately calculate feral cat population estimates (Guttilla 2007). Additionally, the introduction of animals, domestic or exo tic, to the island has not been regulated and municipal and county regulations are outdated and not enforced. Furthermore, public opposition to lethal cont rol hinders efforts to fundraise for the development and maintenance of a feral cat control program. Staff from CIC now pursue and rem ove stowaway raccoons and opossums (Didelphis virginiana ) reported from the island (King and Duncan 2014). Raccoons are the likely source of CDV th at decimated the Santa Catalina Island fox population in 1999-2000 (Munson 2010). 2. Conservation Efforts for non-Listed Island Fox Subspecies Conservation efforts are currently impl emented by the Navy for San Nicolas and San Clemente Island foxes, the two island fox subspecies that are not federally listed. In 2003, the FWS and the Navy signed a Conservation Agreement to facilitate implementation of conserva tion measures for the island fox on San Clemente Island. Implementation of the Conservation Agreement has supported ongoing research, improved population m onitoring, and impact minimization measures to reduce the potential of th reats to the island fox on San Clemente Island. The FWS currently coordinates with the Navy regarding conservation measures to benefit island foxes on San Nicolas and San Clemente Islands. The effort includes an evaluation of popul ation status, identification of directions for future Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 38 research, and recommendations on c ontinuing the following conservation measures: Including effects on island foxes in all NEPA documents and mechanisms to minimize effects to island foxes; Continuing measures to minimize mo rtality from vehicle strikes; Continuing public awareness campai gns concerning island fox biology and status; Reducing potential adverse effects from pest management on the island fox; Prohibiting dogs on San Clemente Island or San Nicolas Island; Continuing feral cat control on San Clemente Island and; Maintaining refuse bin modifica tions on San Nicolas Island and implementing bin modifications on San Clemente Island. To reduce the impact of vehicles as a mo rtality source, speed limits have been established and education programs have been developed targeting island personnel. The Navy has modified refuse bins, and discourages hand-feeding of island foxes. Feral cats were recently removed from Sa n Nicolas Island in an effort funded by the Montrose Settlements Restoratio n Program and implemented by Island Conservation and IWS. A total of 59 feral cats were removed by live trapping and hunting in 2009-2010 (Hanson 2012). Efforts to control feral cats on San Clem ente Island began in 1986 (Phillips and Schmidt 1997; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Se rvice 2004). When cat eradication efforts were interrupted for a 6-month interval, cat populations rebounded to pre- control levels and, in some instances, doubl ed in size (Phillips and Schmidt 1997). However, in areas where control was maintained for three consecutive seasons, cat numbers were reduced by 20 to 50 percent (Phillips and Schmidt 1997). Feral cat removal continues on San Clemente Island (D. Garcelon, Institute for Wildlife Studies, pers. comm. 2014). 2014). The Institute for Wildlife Studies removed 328 cats from San Clemente Island in 2009, 276 cats in 2011, and 166 cats in 2012 (Biteman et al 2010; 2012; 2013). Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 39 3. Monitoring Efforts Monitoring island fox populations has been, and will continue to be, a necessary activity. Given the success of recent recovery efforts, risk to all subspecies has decreased substantially. However, some ri sk will remain even after recovery and de-listing because of the inherently sm all subspecies population sizes, lack of genetic diversity as a result of bottlen ecks, and isolation from other potential population sources. Island fox monitori ng has been conducted for a number of years on each of the Channel Islands. Although methods have varied among islands and through the years, island fox monitoring is practically standardized across the islands, thanks to work by the IRT and the Island Fox Working Group. Island fox population monitoring became st andardized in the 1990s, when density estimation from grid trapping was used on f our of the six islands (Roemer et al. 1994). Recent efforts have used demogr aphic modeling with >25 years of fox monitoring data to refine monitoring so th at it is threat-based and able to gauge recovery (Rubin et al. 2007, Bakker and Doak 2009, Bakker et al. 2009, Coonan et al. 2010). Monitoring Plans A multi-year and highly collaborative monitoring planning process has been completed by the IRT and the RCG. The process included: Issuance of the Technical Analysis Request (TAR) 2.1 \"Development of Population Monitoring Plans for Free-Ranging Island Foxes\" to identify island fox monitoring needs (see Appendix 5). Development of estimates of dem ographic parameters by V. Bakker and colleagues through the compilation and robust analysis of island fox population data (B akker et al. 2009). Development of a population viabilit y analysis (PVA) by D. Doak and V. Bakker (see Appendix 2) to prov ide the conceptual framework for understanding island fox demographi cs and threats to island fox viability (Bakker and Doak 2009). Development of a set of guidelines by the Island Fox Health Technical Expertise Group (TEG) (see Appendix 3), which outlines recommendations for monitoring the health of wild island foxes. Development of a monitoring plan for San Clemente Island foxes (Spencer et al. 2006) to serv e as a framework for TAR 2.1. The Conservation Biology Institute (CBI) coordinated the development of island- specific monitoring protocols with land managers, TEGs, and statisticians to Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 40 identify monitoring needs and to develop the most robust and efficient monitoring protocols for each island. Rubin et al . (2007) developed specific monitoring recommendations for each of the four lis ted subspecies, as well as for the San Nicolas Island fox. Recommendations c onsidered managers' goals, ecological and physical characteristics of the islands as they relate to monitoring needs and constraints, population modeling, evalua tion of statistical robustness, and assessment of island representation (see Ta ble 1 in Appendix 5). The monitoring plan for each island includes a scenario fo r monitoring survival and cause-specific mortality rates and two alte rnative scenarios for trapping to collect demographic data, such as population size and density (see Appendix 5). F. CURRENT STATUS AND TREND 1. San Miguel Island fox On San Miguel Island, no foxes existed in the wild during the period of captive breeding. Reintroduction to the wild began in 2004 and ended in 2007, by which time 62 foxes had been released. Surviv al and reproduction was high for released foxes and the population grew rapidly; th e annual rate of increase averaged 76 percent from 2004-2013. The estimated adu lt population increased from less than 100 in 2006 to approximately 550 in 2013 (Table 1; Coonan et al. 2010, Coonan 2014). Relatively few San Miguel Island foxes ha ve died from predation since re- introduction. Although occasionally eagles have taken foxes, it has not affected fox annual survival, which has stayed a bove 90 percent for most of period from 2004-2013. In 2013, however, island fox survival declined to about 80 percent, and five of the 11 mortalities that occurred in radio-collared foxes had evidence of a parasite never before recorded in island foxes (Coonan 2014). Necropsy of those foxes revealed acanthocephalans (s piny-headed worms) in massive amounts in the lower intestine, associated w ith enteritis (inflammation of the lower intestine), colitis, and emaciation. Acan thocephalans likely contributed to the death of four of the foxes. Specimens of the parasite are cu rrently being studied to identify it to species, which will suggest likely intermediate hosts (sand crabs or lizards, depending on wh ether the parasite is Prolificollis or Oncicola ). Continued monitoring of mortality causes wi ll determine whether the parasite is a significant mortality source for San Miguel foxes, and requires management. Tracking population estimates for the tota l population (both adu lts and juveniles) reveals that it has hovered around 550 foxes since 2010, and this may very well represent carrying capacity for the island (Coonan 2014). This is supported by the general decline in reproductive effort as the population has increased. In 2013, only three pups were caught on the San Mi guel monitoring grids, compared to 32 the previous year. The low reproductive output is likely due both to high fox Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 41 density and extended drought. The combin ation of low mortality and robust population growth puts the San Miguel Is land fox subspecies at acceptably low risk of extinction, according to the recovery planning tool (see R ecovery Criteria). 2. Santa Rosa Island fox Santa Rosa Island foxes were brought in to captivity in 2000, a year after San Miguel Island foxes. As on San Miguel Island, there were no foxes in the wild during the period of captivity. Releases to the wild occurred in 2003-2008, during which time 93 foxes were released. As on San Miguel Island, there was considerable reproductive succe ss in the wild, along with variable mortality (see below), and the recovering population gr ew rapidly. The estimated adult population grew from about 40 animals in 2005 to 732 in 2013 (Coonan et al. 2010, Coonan 2014), with an averag e annual rate of increase ( , lambda) of 60 percent. The high reproductiv e success and survival in the wild allowed the Santa Rosa Island captive breeding and reintr oduction program to cease operations in 2008. When juveniles were included, th e island-wide population estimate was 894 in 2013 (Table 1). This is likely not cl ose to carrying capac ity, since the rate of increase for both the a dult and total population con tinues to be high (Coonan 2014). The Santa Rosa Island population may ultimately approach 1,200 - 1,500 adults, similar to neighb oring Santa Cruz Island. The released and recovering fox population on Santa Rosa Island incurred greater mortality than did the neighboring popul ations on San Miguel and Santa Cruz Islands (Coonan al. 2010; Coonan and Guglielmino 2012; Coonan by golden eagles was signifi cant in 2004-2005, and again in 2010. Golden eagles bred on the island, at two territori es, through 2005. Morphological and molecular analysis of feathers from fox kill sites in 2010 suggested that predation was the work of three closely related, juvenile golden eagles which likely had dispersed to the is land from the mainland (P. Trail, U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service - National Fi sh and Wildlife Forensics Laboratory, Ashland, Oregon, pers. comm. 2014; S. Ta lbot, U.S. Geological Survey, pers. comm. 2014). Although occasional eagle predation may occur on Santa Rosa Island and the other northern islands, it ha s not contributed sign ificantly to annual mortality since 2010. Also, golden eagles are unlikely to co lonize the islands again, because the alien ungulate prey ba se has been removed, and predation mortality - and eagle presence - is tracked via monitoring of radio-collared foxes. Overall predation accounted for 33 of 73 island fox mortalities from 2003-2013 on Santa Rosa Island (Coonan, pers. comm. 2014). Mortality cause was not determined in 29 cases, due to advanced decay of the carcass. Other mortality causes included entrapment in drain pipes (3 cases); intestinal intussusception (collapse of one section of the intestin e into another, 1 case); cholecystitis Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 42 (inflammation of the gall bladder caused by gallstones, 2 cases); leptospirosis (2 cases); and emaciation (3 cases, following wounds). Leptospirosis on Santa Rosa Island, as well as acanthocephalans on Sa n Miguel Island, both illustrate the dynamic nature of pathogens in island foxe s. Leptospira had been observed rarely in island foxes until 2010, when 19 of 31 Santa Rosa Island fox blood samples had antibodies for Leptospira, many at very high titers (Coonan and Guglielmino 2012). This apparent outbreak was confir med by culturing urine samples in early 2011, which showed that both island f oxes and island spotted skunks were shedding the pathogen. Lower titers and seroprevalence in late 2010 suggested the outbreak had run its course. Th ese two cases, discovered by mortality monitoring of radio-collared foxes, underscore the need for disease monitoring and mitigation plans (e.g., epidemic response plans). Significant mortality during the early pha se of reintroduction and again in 2010 prevented the Santa Rosa subspecies fr om attaining the level of biological recovery that the San Miguel and Santa Cr uz Islands subspecies had attained by 2013. By that year, the Santa Rosa Isla nd fox subspecies had one three-year average of population and mortality es timates, below the 5 percent extinction isocline (see Appendix 2). Five such th ree-year estimates are required to meet Recovery Criterion 1, and so the Santa Rosa subspecies is likely to meet this recovery criterion by 2017. 3. Santa Cruz Island fox Between 2001 and 2003, the NPS and TNC br ought 18 Santa Cruz Island foxes into captivity, leaving no mo re than 100 individuals in the wild (Coonan and Rutz 2002; Coonan et al. 2004). Sixteen of the 18 founders, and a number of captiveborn foxes bred in captivity produ ced a total of 85 pups over 6 breeding seasons. By summer 2006, the captive popul ation had increased to 81 individuals. Due to the impact of golden eagle predati on on released Santa Cruz Island foxes, few were released from captivity prio r to 2006. Seven of 12 captive-born Santa Cruz Island foxes released to the wild in 2002 to 2003 died from golden eagle predation within 5 weeks of release (Coonan et al. 2005a). The remaining captive-born animals were brought back into captivity by January 2004, and no Santa Cruz Island foxes were released in 2004 or 2005. A high survival rate (approximately 80-p ercent survival in 2003) coupled with excellent reproduction in the wild, incr eased the wild Santa Cruz Island fox population to at least 156 known individua ls by early 2006, with an island-wide estimate of 207. With the removal of the last known nesti ng golden eagle pair from Santa Cruz Island in June 2006, releases of captive-bor n pups resumed in July 2006. Survival Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 43 rates of captive foxes were much highe r than in previous release attempts (survival of captive born foxes released in 2006 was 67 percent in 2007). Therefore, the remaining foxes were released in 2007 and 2008 and the captive breeding facility was closed. Since that time golden eagle predation on foxes has decreased. Only 10 of 37 recorded mo rtalities in 2008-2013 were ascribed to golden eagle predation. As of 2013 the to tal estimated population of Santa Cruz Island foxes was 1,354 and the survival ra te has been greater than 90 percent since 2011 (Table 1; C. Boser, The Natu re Conservancy, pers. comm. 2014). As on San Miguel and Santa Rosa Islands, there have been occasional golden eagle sightings on Santa Cruz Island, and perhaps one predation mortality per year, but it has had a negligible effect on f ox survival and population growth. Pathogens such as acanthocephalans or Leptospira have not been found on Santa Cruz Island. Recent serological testing showed no exposure of Santa Cruz Island foxes to any of five pathogens (canin e adenovirus, CDV, canine parvovirus, canine coronavirus and canine herpes virus) (Coonan et al. 2010). As on San Miguel and Santa Catalina Is lands, Santa Cruz Island foxes have reached the threshold of density and mort ality combinations that denote biological recovery. Estimates for 2013 demonstrate fi ve three-year aver ages of mortality and population safely below the 5 percent extinction isocline for the subspecies (see Appendix 2). The population may ha ve reached carrying capacity, as on San Miguel Island. Adult population estimat es for Santa Cruz Island in 2010-2012 were 907, 827, and 1,073 foxes, respectivel y; though there wa s no statistical difference among those estimates (Table 1; C oonan et al. in press; C. Boser, The Nature Conservancy, pers. comm. 2014). 4. Santa Catalina Island fox Like the Santa Cruz Island fox subspeci es, Santa Catalina Is land foxes recovered fairly quickly from the population lo ws in 1999-2000, with a total population estimate (including pups) in 2013 of 1,852 individuals, of which 1,594 were adults (Table 1; King, Santa Catalina Island Conservancy, pers. comm. 2014). The population has steadily increased since 2000, and may be approaching carrying capacity, with a total population estimate (i ncluding pups) of around 1,500 foxes in 2011 and 2012. As of 2014, the CIC annually monitored fox population size by transect trapping in the fa ll, and maintained a large sample of radio-collared foxes, including unvaccinat ed disease sentinels, for mortality monitoring. Disease remains a concern for Santa Catalina Island foxes, since the island has high accessibility and a sizable human population with domestic dogs and cats, many likely unvaccinated. Furthermore, seven raccoons and two opossums were removed from the island between 2007 and 2013, typically arriving as stowaways Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 44 on boats (King and Duncan 2014). The strain of CDV that caused the catastrophic decline of Santa Catalina Island foxes in 1999-2000 was most closely related to that observed in raccoons (Timm et al. 2009). The CIC vaccinates over 300 foxes annua lly (about 80 percent of all foxes captured) against CDV and rabies. Recent serology indicated low, but nonetheless present, seroprevalence to C DV in Santa Catalina Island foxes, and some seroprevalence to canine adenoviru s, canine parvovirus and canine corona virus (King and Duncan 2014). Santa Catalina Island foxes continue to have an unusually high incidence of ceruminous gland tumors, cancers occurring in the ear canal and associated with inflammation from ear mites. Treatment with ivermectin has been found to reduce inflammation and inci dence of cancer (Coonan 2011). Other sources of mortality include, but are not limited to, effects from competition with feral cats and mortality from vehicle strikes. 5. San Clemente Island fox Recent trends in annual population estim ates indicate that the San Clemente Island fox is increasing ( is equal to 1.15), and the total population size in 2013 was estimated to be 1,000 foxes (M. Booker, U.S. Navy, pers. comm. 2014). Previously, Coonan (2003) had reported an estimated population size of 680 adult San Clemente Island foxes. Schmidt et al. (2005a) reported an estimated population size of 396 individuals in 2004, after applying density corrections. San Clemente Island fox survey, mon itoring, and population estimate methods changed in 2007. The 2007 San Clemente Island fox population estimate, based upon the new methodologies, ranges from 302 individuals to 727 individuals (Garcia and Associates 2008). The 2009/2010 population was estimated to be 714 individuals (Coonan 2011). 6. San Nicolas Island fox Island foxes have been monitored annu ally on three permanent grids on San Nicolas Island since 2000. Over that time, the population has mainly been stable, with some of the highest island fox dens ities ever recorded (up to 15 foxes per square kilometer). However, while indivi dual foxes appear to be in good health, the population currently seems to be in the midst of a sustained decline which began in 2010. The island-wide populat ion estimate in 2009 was 619 individuals; in 2012 it declined to 460 individuals; and in 2013, declined again to . comm. 2014; Hudgens and Garcelon 2014). Most the decline may be due to ne gative density-dependence causing the population to correct after exceeding carrying capacity or it is a result of extended drought conditions limiting resources. Fera l cats were removed from the island in Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 45 2009-2010, but cat trapping activities had no effect on island fox survival. Additionally, a disease outbr eak has not been ruled out . Serology results from 2013 indicated that 62 percent of tested f oxes had measurable titers for CAV; 30 percent were high titers i ndicating recent exposure. N one of the 27 previously unvaccinated foxes tested positive for CDV, but 7 had titers of 1:8 but less than 1:16 which were considered suspect (Hudgens and Garcelon 2014). Canine parvovirus was not detected in 2013, t hough it was detected in 16 percent of 2009 samples and in nearly 99 pe rcent of samples from 2001-2003. 7. Summary On the northern Channel Islands, gold en eagle removal and captive breeding programs with reintroductions have redu ced the risk of extinction for the San Miguel Island fox, Santa Rosa Island fox, and Santa Cruz Island fox and have allowed the re-establishmen t of wild populations on Santa Rosa and San Miguel Islands. Although there is still some pred ation by golden eagles, there have been no golden eagle nests on the northern Ch annel Islands since 2006, which has likely been attributable to the efforts associated with golden eagle capture and translocation, feral pig and ungulate erad ication, and reintr oduction of bald eagles. Although mainland animals are not permitted to be transferred to the northern islands, the possibil ity of unintentional or il legal introduction exists. Thus the introduction of infectious dis ease remains a potential threat to Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, and San Miguel Island foxes. On the southern Channel Islands, fo llowing captive breeding and disease mitigation efforts, the Santa Catalina Isla nd fox population is increasing. Disease remains a concern for Santa Catalina Is land foxes, since th e island has high accessibility and a sizeable human populat ion. Of the two non-listed subspecies (San Clemente Island fox and San Nicolas Island fox), San Clemente Island foxes appear to be stable, while the San Nicola s Island foxes currently appear to be in the midst of a sustained decline which be gan in 2010. Potential threats to Santa Catalina, San Nicolas and San Clemente Island foxes include competition with feral cats, vehicle strikes, and the introduction of inf ectious disease. Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 46 Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 47 II. Recovery Strategy The two primary known threats that resulted in the listing of the four subspecies of island fox (San Miguel Island fox, Sa nta Rosa Island fox, Santa Cruz Island fox, and Santa Catalina Island fox) as endangered were predation by golden eagles and the transmission of disease. Additionally, because the population size of each island fox subspecies is small, they are threatened by stochastic events and the effects of low genetic diversity. Recovery of each subspecies will be achieved by removing, or substantially reduc ing, known threats, such as predation by golden eagles and disease-related mo rtality, and increasing populations to viable levels for long-term survival of each subspecies. The strategy of this recovery plan is to continue the curr ent recovery efforts and to improve and expand recovery actions as necessary. Recent and ongoing island fox recovery efforts include: removing golden eagle s from the northern Channel Islands; reducing the threat of disease; breeding island foxes in captiv ity and reintroducing them to the wild; monitoring wild is land fox populations; reintroducing bald eagles; and the removal of non-native sp ecies (e.g., non-native herbivores). Long-term conservation of the subspecies will benefit from: conducting research on behavioral ecology and reproductive bi ology; increasing island fox education and outreach activities to reduce anthropogenic impacts; restoring island habitat; and assessing the demographic impact of other threats such as mortality from vehicles, competition with feral cats, and emerging disease issues (e.g., ear cancer). These are addre ssed under the Long-term Cons ervation Strategy section. All known golden eagles have been remove d from the northern Channel Islands and yet predation by golden eagles remain s a potential threat to the long-term recovery of island fox populations, includi ng the southern Cha nnels Islands. Even one pair of nesting golden eagles appears to put significant pressure on island fox populations, wher eas island fox populations can sustain some predation by transient birds, as occurred in 2007- 2013 (see Sections 1.B.5. and 1.E). Thus, golden eagle monitoring and the removal of nesting birds need to continue, and management agencies need to be prepared to respond if and when new golden eagles nest on any of the Channel Islands . The successful reintroduction of bald eagles has resulted in the re-establishment of the first bald eagle nests on the northern Channel Islands in over 50 years and their continued presence is expected to be a long-term deterrent to the potential recoloni zation of the islands by golden eagles. A subset of island foxes is vaccinated for CDV and rabies on all islands each year. However, resident and transient domesti c dogs remain in contact with Santa Catalina Island foxes, and the potential for new disease transmission from dogs, cats, and other anthropogenic sources ex ists throughout the Channel Islands. Therefore, reducing the threat of disease will require av oiding introduction of new Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 48 pathogens or novel strains of existing pathogens to the Channel Islands and continued implementation of the epidemic response plans. Captive breeding and reintr oduction of all four endange red island fox subspecies has occurred on the Channel Islands as a means to provide a safe haven from predators and to augment the wild populat ions. Increasing the wild populations to levels with vital rates that minimize the risk of extin ction is integral to island fox recovery. On-island captive breeding a nd reintroduction were conducted from 1999-2008 and ceased due to the success of reintroductions and the rapid growth of recovering populations. All foxes th at were in captivity on Santa Catalina Island and the three northern Channel Islands have been reintroduced to the wild. Timely threat detection and assessment of appropriate management actions is critical to maintain island foxes, which exist in a landscape that has been fundamentally altered by human impact s. Bakker and Doak (2009), provide guidance on the monitoring intensity needed to detect threats imposed by golden eagles and disease before those threats unduly impact island fox populations. We encourage frequent communication among the land managers in an effort to achieve the most cost-effective and rapid recovery of each island fox subspecies while standardizing recovery efforts as much as possible using the best available science and peer review. Manage ment activities need to include: Monitoring island foxes over the long-term; Adapting as new information is gathered; Ensuring that population declines can be detected rapidly; Determining causes of decline; and Eliminating causes of decline as rapidly as is feasible. The Channel Islands' ecosystems have been significantly altered and degraded over the past 2 centuries as a result of the introduction of non-native plant and animal species, unsustainable livestock grazing, and other anth ropogenic activities (e.g., chemical pollution). Additional and increasing human impacts on all islands, such as additional proposed visitation on NPS land (NPS 2013), and increasing use of islands by private boaters who sometimes bring dogs and stowaway animals, may increase the like lihood of transferring diseases to the islands via intentional or unintentional introduction of mainla nd species. Due to the increasing risk of dis ease introduction on the islands, it is important that landowners and land managers retain the ability to use motorized vehicles to access, capture, and quarantine isla nd foxes in remote areas. Managed efforts to restore ecosystems (e.g., removal of invasive species on some islands, including deer, elk, pi gs, sheep, rats, and cattle), will likely continue to affect the island ecosystems, with both positive and negative effects on island fox recovery. Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 49 III. Recovery Goals, Objectives, and Criteria A. RECOVERY GOAL The goal of this recovery plan is to recover the San Miguel Island fox, the Santa Rosa Island fox, the Santa Cruz Island fox, and the Santa Catalina Island fox so they can be delisted (removed from th e List of Threatened and Endangered Species) when existing threats to each respective subspecies have been ameliorated such that their populations have been stabilized and have increased. The interim goal is to recover these subs pecies to the point that they can be downlisted from endangered to threatened status. B. RECOVERY OBJECTIVES Recovery objectives are discrete targets that, when taken together, comprise the conditions that indicate a species may be warranted for delisting. Recovery objectives identify mechanisms for meas uring progress toward and achieving the recovery goal. Achieving the recovery goal requires: 1) increasing the population size and demographic rates to self-sustaining leve ls; and 2) reducing or eliminating the current threats to the surviv al of each subspecies. 1. Recovery Objective 1: Each federally listed subspecies of island fox exhibits demographic characteristics consistent with long-term viability. 2. Recovery Objective 2: Land managers are able to respond in a timely fashion to predation by nesting golden eagles or signif icant predation rates by transien t golden eagles, to potential or incipient disease outbr eaks, and to other identifie d threats using the best available technology. For an island fox subspecies to be cons idered for downlisting from endangered to threatened status, recovery objective 1 is met. For an island fox subspecies to be co nsidered for delisting, recovery objective 1 and recovery objective 2 are met. Each listed subspecies may be cons idered for downlisting or delisting independently of the other subspecies. Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 50 C. RECOVERY CRITERIA An endangered species is defined in the Endangered Species Act as a species that is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range. A threatened species is one that is li kely to become endangered within the foreseeable future throughout all or a si gnificant portion of its range. When we evaluate whether or not a species warrant s downlisting or delisting, we consider whether the species meets either of these definitions. A recovered species is one that no longer meets the Act's definitions of either threatened or endangered. Determining whether a species should be downlisted or delisted requires consideration of the of the same five categories of threats ( i.e., the five threat factors, A-E) which were considered wh en the species was listed and which are specified in section 4(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act. The island fox recovery criteria are meas urable standards for determining whether an island fox subspecies has achieved its recovery objectives and may be considered for downlisting or delisting. The recovery criteria presented in this recovery plan represent our best assessment of the c onditions that would most likely result in a determination that down listing and/or delisti ng of the San Miguel Island fox, Santa Rosa Island fox, Santa Cruz Island fox, or the Santa Catalina Island fox is warranted. Achieving the prescribed recovery criteria is an indication that the species is no longer threatened or endangered. Because an actual change in status (d ownlisting or delisting) re quires a separate rulemaking process that is based on a status assessment, including an analysis of the same five factors that were analyzed at listing, the Recovery Criteria below pertain to and are organized by these factors. Each Recovery Criterion applies to all four subspecies, except where noted otherwise. Factor A: The present destruction, modi fication or curtailment of its habitat or range. We believe that, if the threats under f actors C and E are ameliorated, then the improvements in the habitat that are expect ed to occur with removal of herbivores responsible for habitat degradation may be a long-term benefit to the island fox, but is not necessary for recovery. Ther efore, we are not proposing recovery criteria under this factor. Factor B: Overutilization for commercial, scientific or educational purposes. Overutilization is not currently known to be a threat for this species. Therefore, no recovery criteria are ne cessary for this factor. Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 51 Factor C: Disease or predation. To address recovery objec tive 2, disease and predation pressures must be reduced. This will have been accomplished if the following have occurred: C/1: Golden eagle predation: a. To reduce the threat of extincti on to the San Miguel Island fox, the Santa Rosa Island fox, and the Santa Cruz Island fox, the rate of golden eagle predation is reduced and maintained at a level that is no longer considered a threat to island fox recovery through development of a golden eagle management strategy. The strategy will be developed by the land manager(s) in consultation with the FWS and will include review by the appropriate IRT Technical Exper tise Group or the equivalent. This strategy includes: Response tactics (including the use of helicopters and net-guns) to capture nesting golden eagles and any transient golden eagle responsible for significant isla nd fox predation per the golden eagle response strategy. Tactics to minimize the establishment of successful nesting golden eagles; An established island fox monitoring program that is able to detect an annual island fox predation ra te caused by golden eagles of 2.5 percent or greater, averaged ove r 3 years (Bakker and Doak 2009); and An established mortality rate or population size threshold that, if reached due to golden eagle predation, would require the land manager(s) to bring island foxes into captivity for safety. b. The golden eagle prey base of d eer and elk is removed from Santa Rosa Island. At present, golden eagles are not known to prey upon Santa Catalina Island foxes. If mortality as a resu lt of golden eagle predation becomes a threat to the Santa Catalina Island fox, implement the above measures as necessary. C/2: A disease management stra tegy is developed, approved, and implemented by the land manager(s) in consultation with the FWS and includes review by the appropriate IR T TEG or the equivalent. This strategy includes: Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 52 Identification of a portion of each population that will be vaccinated against diseases posing the greatest risk for which vaccines are safe and effective. Vaccinations to be provided and numbers vaccinated will be developed in consultation with appropriate subject-matter experts; Identification of actual and potential pathogens of island foxes, and the means by which these can be prevented from decimating fox populations; Disease prevention; A monitoring program that provides for timely detection of a disease outbreak, and an associated em ergency response strategy as recommended by the appropriate subject-matter experts; and A process for updating the disease st rategy as new information arises. Factor D: Inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms. We believe that if the threats under factors C and E are ameliorated, then additional regulatory mechanisms (be yond existing ones) are not necessary. Therefore, we are not proposing Rec overy Criteria under this factor. Factor E: Other natural or manm ade factors affecting its continued existence. To address recovery objective 1 for each of the four subspecies, the subspecies must be protected from other natural or manmade factors known to affect their continued existence. This will have been accomplished if the following has occurred: E/1: An island fox subspecies has no more than 5 percent risk of quasi- extinction over a 50-year period (addresse s objective 1). This risk level is based on the following: Quasi-extinction is define d as a population size of 30 individuals. The risk of extinction is calcula ted based on the combined lower 80 percent confidence interval for a 3 year running aver age of population size estimates, and the upper 80 percent confidence interval for a 3 year running average of mortality rate estimates. This 5 percent (or less) risk level is sustained for at least 5 years, during which time the population trend is not declining. A declining Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 53 trend is defined as the 3-year risk-l evel being greater in year 5 than year 1. This risk-based recovery criter ion is based on models developed separately for each listed subspecies. A description of the models can be found in Appendix 2. Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 54 Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 55 IV. Recovery Program A. RECOVERY ACTION NARRATIVE The actions identified below are those th at, in our opinion, are necessary to bring about the recovery of island foxes. Thes e actions are subject to modification as dictated by new findings, changes in sp ecies status, and the completion of recovery actions. Each action has be en assigned a priority as follows: Priority 1: An action that is taken to prevent extinction or to prevent the species from declining irreversibly. Priority 2: An action that is take n to prevent a significant decline in species population/habitat quality or some other significant negative impact shor t of extinction. Priority 3: All other acti ons necessary to provide for full recovery of the species. 1. Reduce mortality and maintain productivity for each subspecies of island fox to sustainable levels. Two major mortality factors have been identified, golden ea gle predation and disease. Therefore, most actions iden tified below address these two factors. 1.1. Reduce rate of golden eagl e predation and maintain at a level that is no longer considered a threat to island f ox recovery. Implement and maintain an active monitoring/response progr am for golden eagles as needed. 1.1.1. Develop and implement a formal golden eagle management strategy. This should include plans for monitoring, control, removal, and contingency in case of golden eag le return after removal. The golden eagle management strategy should have the flexibility to adapt to new information and changing conditions, and to evaluate all known means of capturing golde n eagles, including helicopter use in remote areas, or suppressi ng their ability to prey on island foxes. 1.1.1.1. Develop and implement a formal golden eagle management strategy for San Miguel Island (Priority 1). 1.1.1.2. Develop and implement a formal golden eagle management strategy for Sant a Rosa Island (Priority 1). Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 56 1.1.1.3. Develop and implement a formal golden eagle management strategy for Sant a Cruz Island (Priority 1). 1.1.2. Monitor for golden eagle activity. Conduct annual monitoring at minimum during the nesting season to detect any resident golden eag les. Monitoring should include aerial and ground surveys as needed and training for all field staff to identify and report all eag le sightings. Maximize all opportunities to locate golden eagles whenever any field activities are undertaken. 1.1.2.1. Monitor for golden eagle ac tivity on San Miguel Island (Priority 2). 1.1.2.2. Monitor for golden eagle ac tivity on Santa Rosa Island (Priority 2). 1.1.2.3. Monitor for golden eagle ac tivity on Santa Cruz Island (Priority 2). 1.1.3. Remove golden eagles to maintain the Channel Islands free of resident golden eagles. If golden eagles are seen or signs are found of their presence, steps should be taken to determine whether capture and removal to the mainland is necessary. Continue to consult with eagle experts for additional techniques to capture and/or manage golden eagles. Due to the proven difficulty of cap turing golden eagles (Latta et al. 2005) all options for capturing golden eagle should be considered. Improve golden eagle capture by developing and implementing new methods and new technologies. Continue golden eagle trappi ng and removal efforts until all resident golden eagles have been removed from the northern Channel Islands. 1.1.3.1. Complete initial removal of golden eagles from northern Channel Islands. Continue golden eagle tra pping and removal efforts until all resident golden eagles ha ve been removed from the northern Channel Islands. 1.1.3.1.1. Complete initial removal of golden eagles from San Miguel Island (Priority 1). Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 57 1.1.3.1.2. Complete initial removal of golden eagles from Santa Rosa Island (Priority 1). 1.1.3.1.3. Complete initial removal of golden eagles from Santa Cruz Island (Priority 1). 1.1.3.2. Control resident golden eagle s on the Channel Islands, as needed, after 1.1.3.1. above is co mplete to sustain island fox populations. 1.1.3.2.1. Control resident golden eagles on the Channel Islands, as needed, to sustain island fox populations on San Miguel Island (Priority 1). 1.1.3.2.2. Control resident golden eagles on the Channel Islands, as needed, to sustain island fox populations on Santa Rosa Island (Priority 1). 1.1.3.2.3. Control resident golden eagles on the Channel Islands, as needed, to sustain island fox populations on Santa Cruz Island (Priority 1). 1.1.3.3. Identify and manage any activ ities or food sources that are attractants for golden eagles. Minimize the availability of food resources for golden eagles to inhibit successful establishment of te rritories/reproduction and to direct eagles toward capture baits.

Conduct research needed to understand and eliminate golden eagle residency on Santa Rosa Island (Priority 3). 1.1.3.4.3. Conduct research needed to understand and eliminate golden eagle residency on Santa Cruz Island (Priority 3). 1.2. Avoid introduction of new pathoge ns, or novel strains of existing pathogens, to the Channel Islands by restricting or regulating movements of wild and domestic animals to the islands. The small size of island fox populations and genetic homogeneity means that infectious disease has an unusua lly high potential to cause population crashes or even extinction. Island f oxes have a history of exposure to infectious disease, but may be immu nologically na\u00efve to pathogen strains that are endemic to the mainland bu t absent from the Channel Islands. Additional details and guidance for this recovery action provided by the island fox health TEG can be found in Appendix 3. Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 59 1.2.1. The ban on bringing pets to Channel Islands National Park, and to TNC land on Santa Cruz Island, sh ould be well-publicized and strictly enforced. 1.2.1.1.

Where there is a clear benefit to bringing domestic dogs to the northern Channel Islands, the quara ntine guidelines established for dogs brought to Santa Cruz Island to assist with pig eradication efforts should be followed (see Appendix 6). 1.2.2.1. Where there is a clear benefit to bringing domestic dogs to San Miguel Island, the quarantine guidelines established for dogs brought to Santa Cruz Island to assist with pig eradication efforts need to be followed (see Appendix 6) (Priority 1). 1.2.2.2. Where there is a clear benefit to bringing domestic dogs to Santa Rosa Island, the quarantine guidelines established for dogs brought to Santa Cruz Island to assist with pig eradication efforts need to be followed (see Appendix 6) (Priority 1). 1.2.2.3. Where there is a clear benefit to bringing domestic dogs to Santa Cruz Island, the quarantine guidelines established for dogs brought to Santa Cruz Island to assist with pig eradication efforts need to be followed (see Appendix 6) (Priority 1). 1.2.3. Movement of non-native species or carcasses to the northern Channel Islands should be avoided wherever possible. 1.2.3.1.

Develop a management strategy for responding to new introductions of animals to Sa nta Cruz Island (Priority 3). 1.2.5.4. Develop a management strategy for responding to new introductions of animals to Santa Catalina Island (Priority 3). 1.3. Implement preventative management to avoid extinction or quasi- extinction of wild populations in th e event of devast ating epidemics. PVA models suggest that the probabi lity of extinction in the face of a rabies or CDV epidemic could be substantially reduced by maintaining a \"vaccinated core\" of animals. This a pproach involves maintaining a small number of animals protected from infection by vaccination. These animals act as a \"safety net,\" intended to survive any epidemics that occur and then to form a founder group fr om which subsequent recovery may occur. PVA models suggest that, assuming vaccination is 100 percent protective, maintaining a \"vaccinated core\" of 80 to 100 vaccinated individuals per island fox subspecies dramatically reduces the probability of population extinction, even when there is a comparatively high (10 percent) probability of a rabies ep idemic in any one year (Schwemm 2007). Additional details and guidance for this recovery action provided by the island fox health TEG can be found in Appendix 3. 1.3.1.

Vaccines against canine parvovirus and adenovirus should to be tested on Santa Cruz Island foxes (Priority 3). 1.3.1.3.4. Vaccines against canine parvovirus and adenovirus should to be tested on Santa Catalina Island foxes (Priority 3). 1.3.2. On each island, maintain vaccinati on cover for rabies and CDV in at least 80 to 100 island foxes. On islands where wild fox popul ations number fewer than 100 individuals, all island foxes should be vaccinated. On Santa Cruz Island, vaccination should be focuse d in one or two localized areas, but specifically in primary access corridors, such as Prisoner's Harbor up canyon to the central valley. On Santa Catalina Island, vaccination efforts should be con centrated around the city of Avalon (where disease introduction is most likely to occur) and around the isthmus (where infecti on could potentially pass between the eastern and wester n subpopulations). However, because of the many points of access to Santa Catalina Island, island-wide vaccination is preferred. When a vaccine is first intr oduced, a proportion of vaccinated individuals should be radio-collared on each island to allow determination of whether vaccination has any negative consequences for island foxes in the absence of an epidemic. 1.3.2.1. On San Miguel Island, maintain vaccination cover for rabies and CDV in at least 80 to 100 island foxes (Priority 1). 1.3.2.2.

Using radio-telemetry, monitor a sample of foxes on each island to detect fox mortalities. At least 10 island foxes selected for radio-collars as part of routine monitoring (as opposed to after a vaccine is first introduced) should not be vaccinated; this allows them to act as sentinels of infection, allowing early detection of future epidemics.

Further research should be conducted as appropriate on other infectious and noninfecti ous diseases that appear likely, on the basis of pathological and demographic analyses, to threaten the Santa Catalina Island fox population (Priority 2). 2. Manage captive island fox populations for recovery. On-island captive breeding and reintr oduction were conducted from 1999-2008 and ceased due to the success of rein troductions and the rapid growth of recovering populations. Cap tive populations of island f oxes were critical to the species' conservation and can continue to be important in the recovery and long- term conservation (see Long-term Conserva tion section) of the four listed subspecies. Captive breeding must be conducted in accordance with the FWS Captive Propagation Policy. Foxes were in itially brought into captivity to prevent extinction from the threat of golden ea gle predation on the northern Channel Islands, and the threat of disease on Sa nta Catalina Island. Captive reproduction has ensured that the island foxes did not go extinct and has contributed to recovery of wild populations by providing individuals for release as the current threats have been brought under control. Captive breeding can be phased out as wild populations recover, but the long-t erm persistence of island foxes (see Long- term Conservation section) may benefit fr om redundant, genetically diverse, and sustainable mainland populations of one or two subspecies. Manage the on-island captive populations of island foxes to augment the wild populations. Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 70 2.1. Continue captive management of island foxes as necessary to provide individuals for release. 2.1.1.

Continue to maintain a Sa nta Cruz Island fox studbook and continue to use the studbook to ai d decisions on fox pairing and release (Priority 2). 3. Establish island fox monitoring strategies. Monitoring of island fox populations has b een, and will continue to be, a crucial activity. Given the inherent risk of small insular populations, robust monitoring of island fox populations and their threats is a key co mponent of recovery and long-term conservation. Such long-term monitoring strategies should incorporate the best established methods to trac k population dynamics and to detect and understand the causes of population declines in a timely manner. To that end, an effective monitoring strategy should be ab le to address each of the following monitoring objectives: Tracking the status of island fox r ecovery, particularly relative to recovery criteria; Guiding island-specific management decisions in a timely manner; Refining parameter estimates for po pulation viability analyses and facilitating cross-island comparisons; and Monitoring to detect a potential fu ture and/or current catastrophic population decline. 3.1. Develop and implement a monitoring strategy for each listed island fox subspecies to detect population dec lines and determine population trends. Monitoring parameters need to be ta rgeted for the purpos e of tracking and determining recovery. These parameters include: Mortality rates (with associated cause-specific mortality rates); Population trend (e.g., , lambda); and Population size, possibly relative to a required minimum population size as informed by PVA. These parameters would provide info rmation necessary for the evaluation of extinction risk based upon the PVA and aid in determining the current Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 74 level of risk to an island fox populat ion (Recovery Criterion 1) as well as aiding in determining the progress to wards recovery. These parameters were presented and reviewed at the second PVA Workshop convened at University of California, Davis in December 2006, including refinement of parameters in the context of r ecovery criteria, to identify desired precision levels. Based on this work shop, the following parameters and associated precision levels have been chosen for the purpose of tracking and determining recovery: Annual estimate of island-wide popul ation size, with an 80 percent confidence interval. Annual estimate of mortality, with an 80 percent confidence interval and cause-specific mortality rates suffi cient to detect a rate of eagle predation of 2.5 percent or grea ter (Bakker and Doak 2009). In addition, these data would provide a means of monitoring for disease outbreaks and facilitate health rese arch and vaccine efficacy tests. Estimate of trend in population size , which can be estimated either from annual abundance estimates or from population models. This estimate has no targeted precision; rather the precision of the trend estimate would be determined by the precision of the population estimates and possibly by precision of mortality rates (see Appendix 5). 3.1.1. Develop and implement a monitoring strategy for San Miguel Island fox subspecies to detect population declines and determine population trends (Priority 1). 3.1.2. Develop and implement a monitoring strategy for Santa Rosa Island fox subspecies to detect population declines and determine population trends (Priority 1). 3.1.3.

Long-term Conservation Strategy The long-term conservation strategy identi fies actions that would further the conservation of the island fox. At this time, these activities are not essential for preventing extinction and are not required for downlisting or delisting a particular island fox subspecies; howeve r, these activities could substantially enhance the long-term conservation of the species a nd may also increase our scientific understanding of the island fox. In the ev ent that an island fox subspecies is recovered and delisted, comp letion of these actions could provide conservation benefits that could prevent fu ture decline of the species. We have identified the following long-term conservation actions: Establish a mainland captive is land fox population on which to conduct research to better unders tand fox behavior, ecology and reproduction, and disease and vaccine efficacy. Increase public awareness to reduce potential threats from anthropogenic activities. Assess the demographic impact of other threats such as mortality from vehicle strikes and compet ition with feral cats. Restore island habitat. Establish conservation agreements. 1. Establish a mainland captive island fox population on which to conduct research to better understand fox behavior, ecology and reproduction, and disease and vaccine efficacy. The establishment of a ma inland captive island fox populat ion could contribute to island fox conservation through improve d opportunities for research and increased opportunities for educating and affecting public attitudes towards the island fox which could result in greater support for island fox conservation programs. A mainland population might al so provide a source population for re- colonization should the subspecies become extinct. Note: unless a subspecies is extinct in the wild, any island fox housed for any reason on the mainland will not be released back to their respectiv e island and will remain on the mainland. A mainland captive island fox population can serve as an acce ssible source of individuals for research. There are still many unanswered questions concerning the best husbandry and management methods for successful captive breeding. Mainland facilities are mo re accessible to veterinary and husbandry experts and more efficient in terms of costs and logi stics. The ability to conduct research trials on the islands is limited. Furthermor e, such trials are currently not possible on the islands because existing captive br eeding facilities have closed. The Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 102 source for a mainland captive population can come from any of the existing island fox subspecies, including non-listed s ubspecies, although TAR 3.6 \"Assessment of the potential benefits and costs of long-term captive populations on the mainland and/or islands\" suggests that the Santa Cruz Island fox population would be the best choice, because this subspecies has the most genetic diversity and the island population is recovering ra pidly. Note: Unless otherwise approved by the FWS and CDFW, only in jured, un-releasab le foxes or abandoned pups that are incapable of surviving in the wild w ill be considered for transfer to zoos. Given that space and resources are limite d to establish redundant populations for each of the four endangered subspecies of island fox it is unrealistic to expect to have a redundant population of each subsp ecies. In the event of a catastrophic loss, two alternatives exist to repopulate an island: 1) use individuals from another existing wild island fox subspeci es; or 2) use individuals from an established mainland captive population where one, or at most two, subspecies would be maintained. As noted above, the Santa Cruz Island fox population has been identified as the best choice to ha ve individuals represented on the mainland for long-term captive populations because this subspecies has the most genetic diversity and the island populat ion is recovering rapidly. Therefore, every effort should be made to provide opportunities to establish this mainland program, including healthy animals that might not otherwise meet the criteria of injured, un-releasable foxes or abandoned pups that ar e incapable of surviv ing in the wild. Below is a list of activities that would benefit island fox research: 1.1 Develop a captive mainland island fox population for research and educational outreach purposes. Develop a long-range strategy for establishing a mainland captive island fox population in accordance with the FWS Captive Propagation Policy and CDFW Policy. This strategy should strive to maximize the genetic and demographic viability of the mainland populations while avoiding or minimizing any detrimental impacts to wild populations. See Appendix 7 for steps necessary in establishing a mainland captive population. Identify and prioritize research que stions that could be addressed using the captive mainland population. This might be achieved by forming a standing advisory committee to review proposals, prioritize projects, and help identify funding sources. Select ed research questions include: 1) determine the best management practices for husbandry to maximize reproduction and ensure animal welfare (e.g., mate selection, housing requirements); 2) biomedical research on Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 103 captive populations to help eliminate and/or control disease threats to the wild and captiv e island fox populations; and 3) development of management and husbandry techniques to maximize fox survival post-relea se (see Appendix 8 for details). 2. Establish, expand and cont inue island fox education and outreach programs. The main objectives of the educatio n and outreach programs include: reduce threats that are under the c ontrol of island managers, residents, visitors, and regulatory agencies; increase public suppor t for existing and future programs dealing with island fox population re covery, threat abatement, habitat improvement and sustainable use of ha bitats; and developm ent of long-term funding support, including fund-ra ising activities, for island fox recovery efforts. Below is a list of such activities that would aid in isla nd fox education and outreach: 2.1 Develop and establish on-i sland education programs. Provide island fox information to re sidents, staff, and visitors to the Channel Islands. On each island with foxes, develop self-guided kiosks, exhibits, and/or programs to provide curr ent information about island foxes and recovery efforts. 2.2 Develop and establish ma inland education programs. Identify educational and outreac h opportunities that could be addressed using the captive mainland population. Develop strong collaborations with existing organizations (e.g., Friends of the Island Fox, Inc. ) working on mainland education programs. All zoos that house island fox popul ations, particularly those in southern California, should include an education program with an assessment requirement of the educ ation programs effectiveness. Mainland island fox exhibits shou ld provide accurate and timely information on the status of and threats to island foxes. Develop island fox presentations, traveling exhibits and publications to be presented or deployed in mainland schools, symposia, meetings and other venues. Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 104 Develop school curriculum materi als on island foxes, consistent with California education standard s that can be used in mainland classrooms prior to student field trips to an island. 2.3 Develop cost effective methods fo r enhancing public awareness and support for island fox recovery. Utilize the media to enhance publ ic awareness and support for island fox recovery programs. Develop an appropriate set of professional evaluation tools (Measures of Success) to help managers and agencies evaluate the effectiveness of the general and island-wide education and awareness programs. Develop an effective set of co mmunication venues for island fox researchers and land managers. 2.4 Continue and expand, as appropriate , the annual island fox conference, and develop a web-based literatur e depository and/or a regular newsletter or list-server to enhance communication. Establish a web-based island fox l iterature library where educators and researchers can access information about the island fox. Develop and publish an annual repo rt on island fox recovery and conservation efforts. 3. Assessing the demographic imp act of other threats such as mortality from vehicle strikes, co mpetition with feral cats, and emerging disease issues (e.g., ear cancer). The threat from anthropogenic sources such as vehicles, competition with feral cats, emerging diseases and other mortality factors may impact island fox population dynamics. Research into the e ffects of these potentia l threats will help the design of long-term conservation strategies. 4. Restoring island habitat. Ultimately the long-term survival and vi ability of the island fox may depend on maintaining and restoring some of the composition, structure, and function of native ecosystems on the islands that have been altered in the past 150 years. These actions include promoting ecologica l conditions that dissuade golden eagle use of the Channel Islands. Preserving and restoring native ecosystem structure and function while preserving significant cultural resources and provid ing for recreationa l opportunities are Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 105 explicit management goals of the NPS; TNC and CIC share similar goals. While island foxes were no doubt components of fo rmerly intact ecosystems, there is no assurance that those intact ecosystems we re optimal in terms of sustaining the largest populations of foxes. For example, the conversion of some shrublands to grasslands during the ranching period may have provided for increased populations of island foxes. On the ot her hand, in the face of aerial predation, shrublands may confer differential advant age to foxes. Consequently, ecosystem restoration activities will need to respond adaptively to the response of island fox populations. The goal of ecosystem restoration is to maintain and restore native ecosystem composition, structure, and function in a manner that does not compromise island fox recovery. Ultimately, activities will restore native ecosystem integrity in a manner that enhances island fox recove ry and long-term conservation, while protecting other listed and sensitive speci es. Because each of the Channel Islands differs significantly in their native ecosystem structure and composition, maintenance and restoration should be ta ilored to each isla nd individually. Below is a list of activities that would aid in ecosystem recovery: 4.1 Identify non-native plants and anim als that may compromise island fox viability and evaluate their imp act on fox populations. Removal or control should be conducted if imp acts are significant or potentially significant and the means for practic able removal or control exists. 4.2 Minimize the likelihood of new non- native species introductions through the use of education, regulation, sanitation, and best management practices. 4.3 Reintroduce or enhance native ecosyst em elements and processes that have been lost or compromised as a result of anth ropogenic activities. 4.4 Prevent excessive human-caused im pacts to island ecosystems' native structure and function to the extent practicable. 4.5 Minimize, to the extent feasible , mechanical, chemical, or acoustic impacts to island foxes and den sites during restoration activity, especially during the breeding and pup-rearing seasons. 4.6 Protect natural water supplies in island fox ha bitat from damage, and avoid eliminating island fox water sources. 4.7 Monitor island fox food resources du ring restoration efforts, including native animal prey populations and plant resources. Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 106 If these food resources change adversely during restoration activity, manage adaptively to provide for adequate food resources during the restoration period. 4.8 Monitor and adaptively manage dist ribution of habitat types on each island during restoration activities to assure sufficient ecosystem services for island foxes, such as hunting habitat, resting habitat, and protective cover (against predation). Although island foxes have historic ally occurred in nearly all vegetation types, maintaining th e native array of these types provides a buffer against unanticipated ecological catastrophe. 4.9 Where non-native species may repres ent a supportive habitat function (food, cover), plan ecosystem restorati on actions to assure alternate prey or other resources provid ed by the non-native species are available and sufficient during the restoration period. 4.10 As naturally-ignited landscape fire on the Channel Islands is rare and most ecosystem elements, including is land foxes, have not been selected for fire resilience, minimize th e likelihood of anthropogenic fire. 5. Establishment of Conservation Agreements. Even with successful mitigation of current threats and the recovery of island fox subspecies to viable population levels, the intrinsically small population sizes of the subspecies and their insular vulnerabili ties subject the differe nt subspecies to the continued threat of catastrophic decline from any number of causes. To reduce the potential for future cata strophic population declines and the consequent need to relist the San Miguel Island fox, the Santa Rosa Island fox, the Santa Cruz Island fox, or the Santa Catalina Island fox post-recovery: A Cooperative Management Agreement should be developed between the land manager(s) and the FWS to address l ong-term conservation needs. The agreement should be designed to respond effectively to any future significant population decline and include: The land manager's strategy and commitment to continue monitoring island fox subspecies such that a ny substantial popul ation decline is detected in a timely manner; and The land manager's strategy to addr ess the long-term conservation of island foxes at the time of proposed delisting.

APPENDIX 2: DISCUSSION OF THE RISK-BASED RECOVERY CRITERION Models were developed for the San Mi guel Island fox, Santa Rosa Island fox, Santa Cruz Island fox, and Santa Catalina Island fox to gain insight into the factors influencing the risk of extincti on for each subspecies population over a 50 year time period (Bakker et al. 2009). The model is a two-stage (pup v. non-pup; i.e., considering only two lif e stages, pups (< 1 year ol d) and animals referred to as adults (> 1 year old )) stochastic matrix model. Demographic rates are simulated based on established relationships with environmental conditions such as golden eagle numbers, island fox densit ies, and weather conditions. The model carefully incorporates uncertainty in our knowledge of island foxes into model predictions. Based on the output of model simulations, it is possible to predict the risk of a population reaching quasi-extinction usi ng adult mortality rate and adult population size. These risk predictions can be plotted as isoclines (see Figures 1a through 1d: a graph has been created fo r each subspecies). Each isocline identifies the risk of the particular subspecies reaching the determined quasi- extinction level of 30 foxe s over the determined timeframe of 50 years based on current mortality rates and population sizes. To use these graphs to assess attainment of recovery criterion 1, one plots the average adult mortality rate against th e average adult population size calculated over three (3) years along w ith their 80% confidence intervals. From the location of this point relative to the risk isoclines, one would be able to identify the current predicted risk of quasi-extinction for the subspecies based upon the model. Recovery criterion 1 is attained when the plotted point and its mortality and population size confidence intervals lie enti rely below the isocline delineating 5% risk of quasi-extinction. Management to avoid quas i-extinction rather than true extinction (e.g., zero individuals) helps account for uncertain ty in models, especially uncertainty associated with population dynamics at small sizes, and it focuses efforts on maintaining populations at levels at whic h management action is most feasible. This approach is used commonly in es timating risk for a population (Morris and Doak 2002), and has been used in the devel opment of risk-based recovery criteria (e.g., Northern right, Fin, and Sperm wh ales). The choice of an appropriate threshold depends on a range of biological and socio-political factors (Burgman et al. 1993). A quasi-extinction threshold of 30 individuals was selected for each of the federally listed island fox subspecies populations. Note: The isoclines provided are to serv e for illustrative purp oses and to provide a visual reference to estimate the ri sk of quasi-extinction based upon the appropriate parameters. The actual risk of quasi-extinction is to be calculated. Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 132 The isoclines associated with the risk of quasi-extinction for each subspecies should be adjusted with ne w information, as necessary.

APPENDIX 3: GUIDELINES AND RECOMMENDATIONS ON VACCINATION PROTOCOLS, CO LLECTION OF HEALTH DATA, AND FUTURE RESEARCH NEEDS RELATED TO FOX HEALTH. This appendix includes additional details associated with Recovery Actions 1.2 to 1.4 of the Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox and was developed in coordination with the Fox Hea lth Technical Expertise Group. Recovery Action 1.2 - Avoid introduction of new pathogens, or novel strains of existing pathogens, to the Channel Islands by restricting or regulating movements of wild and domest ic animals to the islands. Movement of both domestic and wild mamm als to the northern Channel Islands is not permitted under Channel Islands Nati onal Park regulations, although a small number of domestic dogs have been brought to Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz Islands in association with the various forms of hunting operations. Additionally, there is a chronic risk of animals (particularly do mestic dogs, cats, and rats) being brought ashore unofficially from boats. Where there is a clear benefit to bringing such animals to the islands, veterinary experts familiar with threats to island foxes should be consulted to develop appropriate quarantine or containment protocols. Restricting animal movements to Santa Ca talina Island is more difficult than to the northern Channel Islands because Sant a Catalina Island is composed entirely of private land, has thriving resident and visitor populations, and has easily accessible regularly scheduled transport to and from the mainland. Efforts to minimize animal movement to the isla nd could include education campaigns, developing partnerships with the City of Avalon and others, and adopting regulations restricting such move ment and controlling feral cats. Education campaigns should be extended to mainland-based boaters that may inadvertently transport stowaway wild life such as raccoons to the islands. Management and Removal of Introduced Mammals All islands should have protocols in place to deal with invasive animal introductions. Protocols should be communicated to non-fox personnel so that proper steps are taken in the event of disc overy of invasive animals on boats or on an island. Parties involved with protocol de velopment should be cognizant that return of wild animals to the mainland for release back into the wild may risk introduction of unique infec tious agents (such as Spirocerca or island-evolved viral strains) to na\u00efve mainland wildlife populations, and is not advisable. Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 138 Protocols should address: 1) requiring return of a boat to the mainland before exit of a stowaway animal; 2) capture protocols developed with other agencies which might be invo lved (depending on the island) such as the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW), the U.S. Navy, or the City of Avalon; 3) preconditions, indications, and protocols for lethal removal whic h should be developed with input from CDFW; 4) samples such as blood and feces which should be taken from captured invasive anim als; 5) protocols for determining whether animals which have been lethally removed should be necropsied or otherwise tested for disease. Recovery Action 1.3 - Implement Pr ophylactic Management to avoid extinction or quasi-extinction of wild populations in the event of devastating epidemics. Any prophylactic vaccination against canine distemper virus (CDV) would need to take into account serol ogical evidence that a strain of CDV is currently circulating within the wild populations on Santa Cruz and Santa Catalina Islands with no documented ill effect s (strains with similarly benign effects occurred on San Miguel Island and Santa Rosa Island but may have been eliminated by vaccination when all foxes were taken into captivity and vaccinated). These strains may confer immunity to more da ngerous strains; their eradication through vaccination should be avoided if possibl e. Maintaining a \"core group\" of a minimum of 80-100 CDV vaccinated individu als of each subspecies should allow such viruses to continue circulating in the unvaccinated proportion of each population. Larger numbers of animals ma y be vaccinated within \"core\" areas if managers wish to increase the likelihood of higher survival percentages in the event of a CDV epidemic. Prophylactic vaccination against rabies should take into account the public health concerns that are associated with rabi es, the risks to personnel incurred when handling potentially infected foxes for th e purpose of vaccination in the event of an epidemic, and the potential desire of managers to increase the likelihood of survival percentages that are greater th an the minimums required to avoid quasi- extinction. Maintaining a core group of a minimum of 80 - 100 individuals vaccinated against rabies, plus as many a dditional individuals in the population as can be opportunistically vaccinated, is advi sable in order to maximize the number of foxes that would be expected to surv ive an epidemic. This approach would also reduce the level of th reat to human and domestic animal populations that are in contact with island foxes. 1.3.1 - Test safety and antibody response to vaccination in captive island foxes under appropriate research protocols. Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 139 1.3.1.1 - Conduct CDV vaccination tria ls by administering two vaccinations at different bodily loca tions on island foxes during a single vaccination event . Purevax recombinant CDV vaccine has been shown to be safe for use in island foxes, and to trigger seroc onversion after admi nistration of two intramuscular doses of vaccine given two weeks apart. However, field application of the vaccine would be more practicable if protection could reliably be achieved in the course of a single handling ev ent, recently done successfully with wild dogs. 1.3.1.2 - Assess the efficacy of standard inactivated rabies vaccines in producing an antibody response in island foxes This may be achievable using serum already banked from captive island foxes. Further studies are likely to be necessary if initial investigations suggest a poor immune response to rabies vaccination as implemented. Recombinant subunit rabies vaccines also need to be tested for safety and ability to induce an antibody respons e. Additionally, rabies vaccine delivered in bait should be assess ed for ability to induce an antibody response. 1.3.1.3 - Vaccines against canine parvovi rus and adenovirus should be tested on island foxes Inactivated and monovalent modified live vaccines should be considered for testing with the knowledge that inactivated vaccines may not induce a robust antibody response and modified-liv e vaccines may induce disease. While an epidemic of parvovirus or ad enovirus is unlikely to occur in the near future because of evidence of extensive exposure in the current populations, testing vaccines would be appropriate to have knowledge of their safety and effects if fu ture vaccination is needed. 1.3.2 - On each island, maintain vaccination cover for rabies and CDV in at least 80 to 100 island foxes All vaccinated foxes should be perm anently marked, and detailed records should be maintained on the vaccinati on status of all island foxes handled, whether in the wild or in captivity. This is important to avoid confusion in the future interpretation of serology results. Given uncertainties about the immune stat us of island foxes given single vs. repeated doses of vaccine, and the desi rability of retaining nonlethal CDV strains in circulation on the islands if possible, it would be advisable to identify (and mark) the individuals to be vaccinated, and then re-vaccinate as many as possible. Because of attriti on and failure to capture vaccinated individuals, new indi viduals may need to be vaccinated annually to maintain a Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 140 core population of vaccinated island foxes. Less systematic approaches risk protecting too few island foxes (if sing le doses of vaccine do not confer protection, and only a proportion can be recaptured for boosters), or too many island foxes (if single doses are eff ective but assumed not to be so). Recovery Action 1.4 - Establish monitori ng and response strategies to detect and manage infectious disease threats to island fox population persistence. 1.4.1 - Monitor to detect disease-related mortality Ensure that management activities to avoid introducing new infectious diseases to island fox populations, and to avoid complete extinction in the face of devastating epidemics, are combined with mechanisms to detect, and respond to, any outbreaks that could occur. All staff working on the Channel Isla nds, irrespective of their duties and expertise, should be trained to recogni ze and immediately report sick or dead carnivores, including island foxes. A ll staff should be trained to avoid exposure to diseases. Necropsies should be performed as soon as possible for all carnivores that die from causes other than trauma to dete rmine if the cause was an infectious disease potentially transm issible to island foxes. 1.4.2 - Annually collect blood samples from a proportion of island foxes on all islands to evaluate ongoing di sease risks to island fox populations Decisions about whether or not clinical interventions are justified will depend not only on information on mortality but also on the immune status of the population concerned. For example, a recent study suggests that foxes on all islands have been exposed to CDV a nd canine parvovirus (Clifford et al. 2006), indicating some degree of populat ion protection and therefore little need to intervene if a small number of deaths were detected. However, patterns of exposure are lik ely to be dynamic and in small isolated populations pathogen populations can easily die out leaving the host population entirely susceptible to reinfection a generation later. Island fox blood samples should be collect ed from a representative proportion of each subspecies during each year. If achievable, these samples should be collected, at a minimum, from each island fox population during each year including: all radio-collared individuals; 25 individuals sampled in a previous year; up to 25 previously un-sampled adults from a variety of age classes and geographical location; and Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 141 as many previously un-sampled yearli ngs and pups (aged >5 months to avoid maternal antibodies) as possible. 1.4.3 - Develop response strategies fo r responding to island fox deaths from infectious diseases known to represent serious threats to the persistence or recovery of the wild populations. This strategy should include: a list of the veterinarian s and other relevant expe rts willing and able to advise on appropriate management, a nd their emergency contact details; a protocol for expediting transporta tion of relevant personnel to the affected island(s); facilities, equipment and supplies on site for investigating an outbreak; facilities, equipment and supplies on s ite for vaccination, quarantine, or treatment if indicated; measures to contact and work with th ese individuals if a disease outbreak occurs; and a stockpile of traps to capture isla nd foxes if needed for vaccination. Intervention for rabies Intervention in a rabies epidemic ma y or may not be advisable, and is dependent on many factors. These in clude the percentage of the population that had been previously vaccinated, the geographic extent of detected disease, the availability of oral bait-based vaccine, and the number of personnel available to implement an intervention strategy who are vaccinated against rabies and properly trained. Immediate vaccination of all wild island foxes on the affected island, preferably commenc ing in areas remote from the index case, is advisable if oral bait-based vaccines are available, and have been tested and shown to be safe for island foxes. Trapping and vaccinating could pose unacceptable risks to personnel, and should not be utilized unless absolutely necessary, and only after consultation with the island fox health expertise group and other experts. Th e intensity of monitoring should be increased island-wide to de tect both sick and dead animals. Euthanasia is recommended for sick animals. Rabies vaccination of human staff on the Channel Islands would also be advisa ble under these circumstances. Regular training should be conducted to mini mize the likelihood of inadvertent human exposure to rabies in the event of an epidemic. Intervention for canine distemper Intervention in a CDV epidemic may or may not be advisable, and is dependent on many factors. These in clude the percentage of the population Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 142 that had been previously vaccinated, the geographic extent of detected disease, the availability of adequate isolation, and levels of staff training. Intervention could include immediate vaccination of all wild island foxes on the affected island, preferably commencing in areas remote from the index case, however trapping and vaccinating could potentially increase the spread of the disease via contaminated equipment or personnel. The intensity of monitoring should be increased island-wide to detect both sick and dead animals. Euthanasia of sick animals may be advisable after veterinary exam or consultation if isolation from other island foxes, both in the wild and in captivity, cannot be assured. Bringing apparently health y foxes into captivity may also be inadvisable unless strict i ndividual quarantine measures are possible, since some apparently healthy individuals could be incubating the disease. Screening of accumulated serum samples should be commenced immediately. Further blood sampling of the wild is land fox population could be used to track the epidemic; serum from juve niles (aged 5-12 months) would be particularly helpful in this regard. Maintain a stockpile of Merial Purevax Ferret vaccine sufficient to protec t a population in the face of a CDV outbreak at a central location and use as needed on whichever of the islands may be affected. Merial Purevax Fe rret is the only vaccine against CDV that is both safe for use in island fo xes and also triggers seroconversion; however, it is only available intermittently. Intervention for parvovirus or adenovirus Sick island foxes may be taken into ca ptivity, isolated, a nd treated if proper isolation facilities and trai ned personnel are available. Scat surveys should be conducted to evaluate the pr evalence of virus-induced diarrhea. If the virus were to be isolated from any sample, th e strain should be investigated. As for CDV, screening of accumulated serum samples should be commenced immediately, as should prospective sampling to track the progression of the epidemic. Samples from juveniles (age d 5-12 months) would be particularly valuable for the latter purpose. Literature Cited Clifford, D.L., island fox ( ) implications for conservation.

APPENDIX 4: GUIDELINES FO R VACCINATION AND SAMPLING OF CAPTIVE AND WILD POPULATIONS Review of appropriateness of vaccination Canine distemper and rabies are th e diseases most likely to cause extinction, so vaccination is st ill considered important. Canine distemper virus (CDV) and rabi es vaccines are available and safe for the foxes and the ecosystem. Because of continued endangered status, it is desirable to provide a safety net through core popul ation vaccination. As long as monitoring is continuing, vaccination does not entail significant extra effort or cost. A proportion of foxes in larger popula tions should not be vaccinated against CDV in order to allow circulat ion of existent endemic wild viral strains. There are no concerns with assuring that wild rabies viral strains circulate in the population, so vaccination of a larger proportion of the population against this disease is acceptable for maximum fox and human protection in the event of an outbreak. Rabies has a public health aspect that may influence vaccination numbers, epidemic response, and locations of vaccinated core populations. Vaccinating a greater proportion of the population than the minimum required to avoid extinction (based on modeling) is a possible alternative to direct epidemic response and / or resumption of captive population maintenance in the event of an epidemic. Vaccination recommendations: The vaccines to use are Merial's Pure vax\u00ae Ferret Distemper Vaccine for CDV and Merial's 3\u00ae for rabies. Vaccinate all captive foxes for CDV and rabies Vaccinate all captured foxes against rabies EXCEPT radio-collared disease sentinels Vaccinate all opportunistically caught anim als on islands with small populations (SMI and SRI) against CDV. When the populations reach 50% of the recovery goal, transition to the long-te rm core vaccination program. On islands with larger populations, a minimum of 20 radio-collared animals should not be vaccinated so that they can serve as a disease sentinel population for early detection of an epidemic. These individuals should be juveniles (1 - 2 years old if possible), and should be distributed as randomly as possible across the island. On islands with larger populations, v accinate core group(s) totaling a minimum of 80 - 100 animals against CDV and rabies in strategic geographic location(s) in perpetuity. The decision to vaccinate animals radi o-collared for purposes other than disease sentinels depends on management goals.

On islands with larger populations, CDV vaccinate additional foxes up to the number that managers desire to have remaining after an epidemic.

Continue collection and archiving of serum and bl ood from selected animals for health monitoring. The most valuable animals to bleed are pups and AC I, the disease sentinels, and other unvaccinated animals that were previously bled. If populations are large enough: Sample as many previously unvaccinat ed (against CDV) age class I and pups > 5 mo old as possible (target number 25-50, including yearlings that are being radio-collared). Sample all unvaccinated (against C DV) radio-collared animals (target number 25-50) Sample 25-50 unvaccinated (against C DV) age class II or above animals that were bled in a previous year. On islands with smaller populations: Sample all unvaccinated (against CDV) foxes over 5 months of age (up to a target number of 100). Animals found to have naturally occurri ng (not vaccine-induced) CDV antibodies should have serology repeated yearly if possible in orde r to determine persistence and fluctuation of antibodies in respon se to exposure to wild viral strains Conduct a serosurvey for antibodies to C DV, canine parvovirus (CPV), canine adenovirus (CAV), and Toxoplasma as often as yearly, but no less often than every 5 years. Using samples collecte d under the protocol in #1 above, test approximately 100 - 125 samples per island. The cost per sample is approximately $50 - 75. If insufficient funds are available, then test 25 juveniles (giving priority to radio-collared animals) and 25 previously bled adults (giving priority to radio-collared animals). 2. Collect feces from 20 wild foxes on each island per year for parasite surveillance and store in 5 - 10% formalin for future analysis. 3. Record body weight and body condition sc ore whenever foxes are handled. 4. Record injuries or other lesions and take photographs if possible Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 147 E. APPENDIX 5: TECHNICAL ANALYSIS REQUEST 2.1 - DEVELOPMENT OF POPULATION MONITORING PLANS FOR FREE-RANGING ISLAND FOXES The draft \"Island Fox Strategy for Rec overy\" dated June 14, 2006, calls for long- term monitoring of all wild populations via the best established methods, to monitor population dynamics and to ensure that population dec lines are detected rapidly and their causes unde rstood. A technical analysis is required to identify the specific objectives (i.e. parameters, precision) of such a monitoring program and to develop statistically robust me thods to meet these objectives. The following outlines the goals of this analys is, suggests which Technical Expertise Groups should be included, and provid es a generalized process by which a monitoring plan can be developed for each island: 1) The goals of this analyses are to: a) assess management objectives and need s related to the fox population on each island, and to recommend monitori ng protocols designed specifically to address these management needs. b) recommend monitoring protocols to collect population parameters necessary for development and refinement of PVAs that may be used to guide management activities. c) recommend monitoring protocols to collect population parameters necessary to determine if recovery criteria, as adopted in the USFWS Recovery Plan, are reached. d) recommend monitoring protocols to collect population parameters necessary for cross-island comparisons to increase our knowledge about island fox population dynamics. e) recommend topics of future research modules which, although not part of a long-term monitoring plan, may be complementary to long-term monitoring activities. In addition, each monitoring plan sh ould include recommendations that facilitate the collection of animal health measures necessary to track population health as per the recomme ndation of the Fox Health Technical Expertise Group. 2) Although the actual development of each island-specific monitoring plan is anticipated to be carried out by qualified contractors, the following Technical Expertise Groups (\"TEG\") should be invol ved in the concep tual development of monitoring plans and participate in a regular review of the plans as they are developed: a) Population Modeling b) Wild Population Management c) Fox Health Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 148 A Task Force including the Chair of each of the above TEGs and/or their designated representatives should be av ailable for discussi on or review of issues as necessary. As work progresses, additional topics may be identified and included in plan development. 3) The following general steps and analyses should be included in developing each plan: a) Collect and review information pertinen t to each island, including past and current monitoring programs, monitori ng data, and ecological and physical characteristics of the islands as they relate to monitoring needs and constraints. b) Identify and articulate monitoring ob jectives using input from managers and the Task Force. c) Analyze existing protocols to evalua te whether they are generating the appropriate parameters needed to m eet current monitoring objectives. For example, a representation analysis of current trapping protocols should be conducted to determine how well trapping efforts represent habitat variability (e.g. vegetation, topography, di stance to shoreline, or general location on the island) and management issues (e.g. distance to roads) on the island. d) Develop recommended protoc ols, possibly with alternative scenarios, for i) monitoring survival and cause specific survival ii) sampling (trapping) to co llect demographic data e) Obtain input from managers and Ta sk Force on the above protocols and alternative scenarios to determin e feasibility and whether desired parameters will be generated. f) Obtain input from a statistician on the above protocols and alternative scenarios to determine if met hods are statistically robust. g) Prepare draft and final monitoring pl ans for each island, allowing time for review and input from ma nagers and Task Force.

APPENDIX 6: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DOG ENTRY AND EXIT FROM THE NORTHERN CHANNEL ISLANDS (SANTA CRUZ, SANTA ROSA, AND SAN MIGUEL ) AND THE NAVY ISLANDS (SAN CLEMENTE AND SAN NICOLAS) Northern Islands: Pre-Movement Quarantine All dogs destined for shipment must be pl aced in a quarantine facility for 30 days before transport to any of the norther n Channel Islands. The purpose of this quarantine facility is to pr event infection of the dogs af ter they have been tested and treated for parasites and infectious diseases. The fac ility should be: 1) isolated from contact with other carnivores , and 2) an all-in/all-out facility (no entry of new animals during the 30 days ). If possible, the dogs should be individually housed and the substrate shoul d be concrete or other surface that can be disinfected. Vaccination All dogs will have a current vaccination for the following: DHPP(LC)- Modified Live Virus Vaccines Canine distemper virus Canine infectious hepatitis (canine adenovirus) Canine parainfluenza virus Canine parvovirus Leptospirosis Coronavirus Killed Vaccines: Rabies Bordetella (kennel cough) Canine influenza H3N8 The entire vaccination series will be completed at least one month, but no more than six months, prior to the dog's arrival on the island. Dogs vaccinated less than one month prior to transport may shed modified vaccine virus or viruses acquired through natural exposure before being protected by vaccines. Dogs remaining on the island must be v accinated annually with killed or subunit vaccines only (if available). If modified live vaccines must be used, the dogs should be kept in quarantine for 30 days after vaccination. Parasites All dogs must be negative for heartworms ( Dirofilaria immitis ) by DiroCheck\u00ae or SNAP\u00ae tests and be screened for microfiliaria six months before being Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 152 transported to the island. Dogs must th en be placed on an appropriate heartworm preventative and kept on preventative tr eatments while on-island. Recommended preventative treatments are Hear tgard Plus\u00ae or Interceptor\u00ae. All dogs must test negative for endoparasi tes prior to transpor t to the island. Three consecutive fecal samples over a 5 day period must be tested for endoparasites using both zinc and sugar floatation methods. Dogs with positive fecal tests should be treated with appropria te anthelmintics and then re-tested until they have three consecutive fecal samp les test negative. If dogs are not individually housed, then all contact anim als must also be treated and retested. Dogs should be rechecked by th e same protocol annually. During quarantine, all dogs must be checked for ectoparasites, including Sarcoptes , Demodex and Otodectes mites. If positive for any mite, the dogs should be appropriately treated and rech ecked until negative. If dogs are not individually housed, all contact animals should also be tr eated and retested. Once negative for ectoparasites, the dogs s hould be placed on an appropriate preventative before being transported to the island. Recommended preventative treatments are Interceptor\u00ae or Frontline\u00ae. Health Certificate All dogs must be given a complete physic al exam by a licensed veterinarian to confirm that they are in good general health and free of evidence of any infectious diseases within ten days of being tran sported to the island. The examination should include confirmation of vaccinati on status, confirmation of negative heartworm, endoparasite, and ectoparasite tests (including ear mites) and a negative Lyme disease test. Post-transport Quarantine Vaccinated animals can still be subclinically infected with inf ectious agents, such as canine distemper, and can therefore act as a source of infection for island foxes. Most dogs that mount an effective immune response to canine distemper virus clear the virus from their system within two weeks of exposure and cease to shed the virus. Also, most subclinical diseas es caused by other agents usually become apparent within three weeks. Therefore al l dogs transported to the islands must be quarantined on-island for three weeks in a location and fac ility that is inaccessible to island foxes. Dogs should be physically assessed by a veterinarian if possible before being released from quarantine. Feces and urine from quarantined dogs should be disposed of in such a manner that foxes are not exposed to either feces or urine or the effluent from the disposal areas (see facility recommendations below). Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 153 Periodic fecal parasite checks should be done every 3 - 6 months while dogs are on the island. Inter-Island Travel and Re-entry Requirements The requirements for vaccination, parasite screening and quarantine are triggered each time a dog travels from the mainland to an island or travels between islands. Dog Holding/Quarantine Fa cility Recommendations Dog holding pens should be constructed in such a way as to have both inner fences and an outer perimeter fence separated from the dog holding pens by at least a 30 foot buffer space to prevent aer osol exposure to island foxes. In addition, multiple strands of electrified wi re should be strung on the top of the fence to further discourage foxes from climbing into the facility. This fence design incorporates features that have been successful in keeping wild foxes from entering the Santa Catalina Island fox breeding facility. Storage of food and equipment should be in a secure off-site location to further deter foxes from attempting entry into the dog holding facility. Rubber boots should be worn inside the peri meter fence and a shoe bath and brush should be provided to step in as leav ing to avoid carrying feces outside the perimeter on shoe bottoms. All fecal waste from dog holding pens will be collected and disposed of in a waste digestion tank or sewage system. Effluent from digestion tanks will discharge underground into the earth. No efflue nt from the digestion tank will be discharged above ground. Pens will period ically be washed down with water. If no concrete trough is present to catch r unoff from runs, especially during rains, a ditch should be dug around the outside of the dog runs (inside of perimeter fence) to prevent rain runoff from ca rrying dog waste through or under perimeter fence. Recommendations for dogs leaving the island: Because domestic dogs residing on any of the northern Channel Islands may have acquired intestinal parasites from the f oxes that may not have been controlled by routine monthly parasite preventatives, a nd might not be detected by routine fecal parasite checks, it is recommended that the dogs have pre-depa rture precautionary parasite treatment. Treatments listed are by parasite type. Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 154 For Spirocerca: Doramectin 10 mg/ml (1%) strength injectable (Dectomax or generic) Dose = 0.4 mg/kg subcutaneously ever y 2 weeks beginning 6 months before departure from the island Examples: A 20 kg (44 lb) dog would get 0.8 ml (ml's are the same as cc's) each dosing. 25 kg - 1.0 ml each dose 30 kg - 1.2 ml each dose 35 kg - 1.4 ml each dose Ivermecin is the alternative treatment if doramectin is not available, but DO NOT GIVE BOTH DORAM ECTIN AND IVERMECTIN: Ivermectin 10 mg/ml (1%) (Ivomec or generic) Dose = 0.3 mg/kg every 2 weeks on same schedule as above. Examples: A 20 kg (44 lb) dog would get 0.6 ml each dosing 25 kg - 0.75 ml each dose 30 kg - 0.9 ml each dose 35 kg - 1.05 ml each dose Certain dogs are overly sensitive to Dora mectin or Ivermectin, and can have symptoms of toxicity after dosing. Sympto ms can be mild to severe (from mild lethargy or GI symptoms to seizures and collapse). A veterinarian should be consulted immediately if any significant symptoms occur with these or any of the drugs outlined. For Mesocestoides: Praziquantel 56.8 mg/ml strength injectable (Droncit or generic) Caution - avoid giving this drug on the same day as Doramectin or Ivermectin because both may cause lethargy, GI ups et, or other symptoms in some dogs Dose = 0.2 ml / 2.3 kg (5 lb) body wt subcutaneously (to a maximum of 3 cc) - give 3 doses, 3 weeks apart. Examples: A 20 kg (44 lb) dog would get 1.8 ml subcutaneously. 25 kg - 2.2 ml each dose 30 kg - 2.6 ml each dose 35 kg - 3.0 ml each dose Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 155 For Coccidia (Isospora, possibly others): Sulfadimethoxine 500 mg tablets (Al bon or generic) Dose = 50 mg/kg the first day orally, then 25 mg/kg daily. Treatment should start 3 weeks before de parture and continue daily till 2 weeks after arrival. Examples: A 20 kg (44 lb) dog would get 1,000 mg (2 of the 500 mg tablets) the first day, then 1 tablet (500 mg) each day thereafter 2 5 kg-1,250 mg (2 \u00bd tablets) the first day, then 625 mg (1 \u00bc tabs) each day 30 kg-1,500 mg (3 tablets) the first day, then 750 mg (1 \u00bd tabs) each day 35 kg -1,750 mg (3 \u00bd tablets) the first day, then 875 mg (1 \u00be tabs) each day For Uncinaria, Toxocara / Toxascaris: Fenbendazole 100 mg/ml oral suspension (Panacur) Dose = 50 mg/kg orally once a day for 3 days, then repeat the 3 day course 3-day treatment should be given 3 times pr ior to departure from the island at 3 week intervals Examples: A 20 kg dog would get 1,000 mg (10ml) orally daily for 3 days each dosing 25 kg - 1,250 mg (12.5 ml) 30 kg - 1,500 mg (15 ml) 35 kg - 1,750 mg (17.5 ml) The suggested schedules above are approximate. Multiple drugs should not be given on the same day, so scheduled tr eatments should be staggered. An exception is that the daily dose of sulfad imethoxine (Albon) can be given at the same time as any one of the other drugs. Associated fecal parasite analysis: A set of 3 fecal samples should be colle cted over a 5 day period for analysis by both zinc and sugar flotation methods prior to initiation of treatment. A second 3 sample set of fecal samples should be co llected and analyzed ~7 days (to allow for analysis time) before the dogs leave the island. After departure of dogs from the is land, options for sterilization of dog housing areas for the purposes of reducin g or eliminating parasite eggs are: The top 6 inches of soil can be removed and buried below 18 inches of normal soil. Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 156 The area can be protected from foxes - becau se parasite eggs are very persistent in the environment, the area should be kept protected for 10 years. The soil (or other surface) can be steame d with a steam pressure cleaner - this works well for hard surfaces like wood or c oncrete, and can be effective with soil, but depth of penetration of the steam is difficult to determine with certainty. Hydrated lime or sodium borate may be mixe d with the soil to kill parasites with desiccation and heat. Concrete areas can be treated with bleach or ammonia. Movement of Working Military Dogs on and off the Navy Islands (Nicolas & Clemente): It is recognized by the fox health group th at military operational considerations are sometimes at odds with previously recommended protocols for dogs entering the islands, especially requirements for quarantine periods. If quarantine periods are not possible, we recommend that all feas ible measures should be taken so that there is no direct exposure of foxes to wo rking dogs and their waste materials. We also recommend that all military working dogs taken to the islands be current on their vaccines and currently on a monthly parasite preventative. We also strongly recommend that no military working dogs come to the island within 2 months of any overseas deployment. This is to make it more likely that any infectious diseases acquired during a deployment will have been detected clinically or through testing pr ior to entry to the island.

Develop methodologies to encourage ma ximum breeding success, together with methods for monitoring and record keeping. Determine the \"Best Management Practices\" for housing, managing and breeding captive Island foxes through testing of different housing and management protocols. Analyze re search results on the social and reproductive behavior of wild island foxes to inform captive husbandry and management. Using an adaptive management paradigm , ensure that captive facilities conform to the best animal care st andards known for comparable species and facilities. Strive to achieve cap tive breeding success rates for island foxes that are comparable with the most successful canid breeding program in the AZA's Canid Taxon Advisory Group (TAG). B. Conduct research using captive island fox populations to enhance their welfare and breeding success in captivity, and to help identify, eliminate and control threats to the recovery and sustainability of wild island fox populations. Analyze mechanisms of mate choice and mate compatibility, e.g. determine the differences in behavioral characteristics of successful and unsuccessful mated pairs a nd the underlying cause(s). Analyze husbandry and management f actors contributing to reproductive success and failure, e.g. determine when in the reproductive cycle failure occurs; determine factors contributing to pup loss; determine the best pen design and management practices for captive island foxes; determine the best management practices for facilitating successful mate choice and producing successful breeding pairs. Conduct biomedical research on capti ve populations to help eliminate and/or control disease threats to the wild and captive island fox populations, e.g. develop and test vacc ines using captive individuals to help develop protocols and practices fo r vaccinations of wild island foxes. Conduct and perfect semen collect ion, cryo-preservation and semen banking for a genetic bank. Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 160 C. Develop \"Best Management Practices\" for rearing island foxes for release into the wild and for their reintroduction. Identify and conduct research on the management and husbandry factors that influence post-release survival of island foxes. Develop the most cost-effective me thods of housing and rearing island foxes to preserve their ability to su rvive in the wild. Develop objectives for evaluation of success of management protocols. Develop \"Best Management Practices\" for releasing island foxes into the wild and for post-release management and monitoring. Variables that need consideration include, in prior ity order, feeding regimes before and after release, post-release support (e .g. food supplementation and shelter), individual differences in island f ox behavior, pre-release housing and adaptation to release sites, social groupings, and medical exams. Include for each variable how, what, how much, when, and for how long. 1. Develop standardized protocols for pre-release preparation. 2. Develop objectives for evaluation of reintroduction success. 3. Develop and implement standardi zed techniques for post-release management and monitoring.

APPENDIX 10: GLOSSARY OF TERMS IN THE RECOVERY PLAN FOR FOUR SUBSPECIES OF ISLAND FOX Age class Foxes are aged according to tooth eruption and wear patterns on the first upper molar (Wood 1958; Roemer 1999) and are assigned to discrete age classes: pups (Age Class 0), young adults (Age Class 1: 7 months to 2 year s), adults (Age Class 2: 2 to 3 years), mature adults (Age Class 3: 3 to 4 years) and old adults (Age Class 4: greater than 4 years) (Roemer 1999). Allee effects Allee effects occur when population growth rate decreases with declining de nsity. Allee effects are expected to occur at very small population sizes and may arise due to mate scarcity, inbreeding, or disruption in social behavior. Allele An allele is one member of a pair or series of genes that occupy a specific position on a specific chromosome. Allelic diversity Allelic diversity is the av erage number of alleles per locus. Allozyme Allozymes are variable forms of the same enzyme. They differ because they originate from different genetic sequences. Studying allozyme variation in a population is an indirect measure of the genetic variation of the population. In this type of study, whole proteins are analyzed instead of the genes they originated from. If there is no genetic variation in a population (monomorphic = \"one form\"), the entire population uses just one form of the gene. If the population shows polymorphisms (\"many forms\") of allozymes, this can be used to describe how much variati on is present. Anthelmintics Anthelmintics are agents used to treat parasitic worms in animals. Bottleneck A population undergoes a bottleneck when a combination of environmental conditions occurs that causes a serious redu ction in the size of a population. A population th at has undergone a bottleneck often has reduced genetic diversity. Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 166 Caliciviruses Members of the Caliciviri dae family of viruses. Calicivirus infections commonly cause acute gastroenteritis, which is the inflammation of the stomach and intestines. Symptoms can include vomiting and diarrhea. Contraindication A contraindication is a specific situation in which a drug, procedure, or surgery should not be used, because it may be harmful to the patient. Degloving A type of injury where an extensive section of skin is completely torn off the underlying tissue, severing its blood supply. Demographic A characteristic used to describe some measurable aspect of a population, such as growth rate, age structure, birth rate, a nd gross reproduction rate. Diurnal An animal that is diurnal is active during the daytime and rests during th e night, as opposed to an animal that is nocturnal, or mostly active during the nighttime. DNA restriction fragments A DNA restriction fragment is a DNA fragment resulting from the cutt ing of a DNA strand by a restriction enzyme by a pr ocess called restriction. Each restriction enzyme is highly specific, recognizing a particular short DNA sequence and cutting both DNA strands at specific points within this site. Restriction fr agments can be analyzed using techniques such as ge l electrophoresis or used in recombinant DNA technology. Docile canid A docile canid refers to any of the various widely distributed carnivorous or omnivorous mammals of the family Canidae, which includes the foxes, wolves, dogs, jackals, and coyotes, that are easily managed or handled. Endoparasite An endoparasite is a parasite that inhabits the internal organs or tissues of an animal or plant Effective population size The effective population size refers to the average number of individuals in a population that actually contribute genes to succeeding generations by breeding. This number is generally lower than the observed population size. Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 167 Evisceration To remove the entrails of; disembowel. Founder A founder is an individual that established a population. The founders referred to in this recovery plan are the indi viduals that were captured from the wild and brought into captivity, establishing the captive breeding programs. Hacking Hacking is a technique used in the captive release of birds of prey where shelter and food is provided for a bird prior to fledging and is continued to be provided until the fledging becomes independent. Heterozygosity Heterozygosity is the pr oportion of individuals heterozygous at loci divided by the number of loci. Heterozygous Heterozygous refers to an individual that possesses two different forms of a particular gene, one inherited from each parent. Hyperpredation Analogous to apparent competition (Holt 1977), hyperpredation occurs when a prey species that can sustain high predation rates subsidizes the extinction of another prey species by acting as an alternate food resource for a shared predator (Courchamp et al. 1999). Hypervariable DNA Usually used to describe the sequences of DNA that do not have a function in th e organism, a.k.a. \"junk\" DNA. These sequences are especially useful for determining differences within the population, because these regions of DNA are not critical and can vary greatly from one individual to another with no consequence. Inbreeding depression Inbreeding depression is an increased expression of deleterious alleles in i ndividuals, resulting in an overall decline in the vigor of a population, due to mating among relatives. Intraspecific aggression Intraspecific aggression refers to aggression among members of a single species. Isocline An isocline is a series of lines with the same slope. For our purposes, an isocline graph provides a way Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 168 to visually identify wher e an island fox population stands in regards to current on-island parameters. Leptospira Very slender aerobic spir ochetes; free-living or parasitic in mammals. Loci (plural of locus) In genetics, the locus is a specific place on a chromosome where a gene is located. Major Histocompatibility Genetic loci that encode for three classes of Complex (MHC) transmembrane (cell) proteins. These proteins induce the organism's immune response. This region is especially important in genetic studies since these types of genes are found in all vertebrates and are numerous, making these regions a rich source of information regarding genetic evolutionary lineage. Th ere can be hundreds of alleles of each MHC locus. Metastasize The spreading of cancer cells from their original site to other parts of the body. Microsatellite DNA Pieces of the same small DNA sequence which are repeated, often in non-coding genetic regions of the chromosome (\"junk\" DNA that does not contain any genes). For example, if a small nucleotide sequence normally repeats within a species' genome, it may repeat a different number of times in different individuals. The numbe r of repeats is easily detected and serves as a basis for measuring the genetic variability w ithin the population. Minisatellite DNA Similar to microsatellite DNA, minisatellites are longer DNA sequences (1000 to 5000 bases long) of 20-50 repeats. Mitochondrial DNA The DNA within an organism 's cells that is located inside the mitochondria, not inside the nucleus. Mitochondrial DNA is matern ally inherited in most species and is used widely to assess taxonomic relationships and differences among populations and species. Mitochondrial DNA analysis (mtDNA) can be used to examine older biological samples that lack cellular material with a nucleus (nucleated), such as hair, bones, and teeth. Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 169 Morbillivirus Morbillivirus is a genus of viruses in the family of Paramyxoviridae that includes the causative agents of measles, phocine distemper, and rinderpest. Necropsy A necropsy is an examination and dissection of a dead body to determine cause of death or the changes produced by disease. Oocyst An oocyst is the thick-wa lled and Toxoplasma. Otitis a bacterial infection of the ear. Pelage Pelage is the wool, fur, or hair coat of a mammal. Phylogeny Phylogeny is the evolutionary development and history of a species or higher taxonomic grouping of organisms. Polymorphism Polymorphism is the existence of two or more forms of individuals within the same animal species (independent of se x differences). Prophylactic management Implementation of protective measures to prevent disease or extinction. Quasi-extinction Quasi-extinction is a drop in numbers of individuals to some very low level at which the population is expected to be critical ly imperiled. At quasi- extinction, population dynami cs are expected to be immediately and adversely affected by factors such as Allee effects, inbreeding depression, and demographic randomness. At this point, management options are severely constrained. Serological A serological test or survey pertains to the measurement and characterization of antibodies, antigens, and other imm unological substances in body fluids (serum), usually blood. Serovar A group of closely related microorganisms distinguished by a characte ristic set of antigens. Stochastic events Chance or random events. Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 170 Sympatric Sympatric refers to popul ations or closely related species that occupy the same or overlapping geographic areas wit hout interbreeding. Synergistic Different actions combined or correlated, working together. Toxoplasmosis An intracellular tissue infection of a parasite from the genus Toxoplasma , particularly in mammals and birds. Vital rates Rates of those components; such as birth, marriage, fertility, and death; which indicate the nature and possible changes in a population. Even when population numbers are st able, there may be changes in the vital rates. References for Glossary Courchamp, F., M. Langlais, and G. Sugiha ra. 1999.

APPENDIX 12: SUMMARY OF COMMENTS Summary of Comments On September 14, 2012, we published a Notice of Availability in the Federal Register of the Draft Recovery Plan fo r Four Subspecies of Island Fox (Draft Plan) for a 60-day comment period ending on November 13, 2012, for Federal agencies, State and local governments, a nd members of the public (77 FR 56858). In accordance with our peer review policy published on July 1, 1994 (59 FR 34270), we solicited expert opinions from four knowledgeable individuals with scientific expertise that included familiarity with canids, carnivores , the geographic region in which the spec ies occurs, and conservation biology principles relevant to the species. We received responses from two of the four peer reviewers. This section provides a su mmary of general demographic information including the total number of letters from various affiliations and also provides a summary of major comments, as appropriate. All le tters of comment on the draft plan are kept on file in the Ventura Fish and Wildlife Office at 2493 Portola Road, Suite B, Ventura, CA 93003. The following is a breakdown of the number of letters received, by affiliation: Federal agencies 2 State agencies 1 Environmental/conserva tion organizations 1 Academia/professional 1 Individual citizens 1 A total of six letters were receive d, each containing varying numbers of comments. Some of the comments were dupl icated between letters. Most letters provided new information or suggestions for clarity. Where appropriate, we incorporated new information into the fina l version of the recovery plan. Some comments dealt with matters of opinion, which did not provide information relevant to the recovery of island fox a nd did not result in changes to the draft plan. A few of the comments concurred with parts of the dr aft plan and while these review comments were helpful, they generally did not result in changes. We did not receive any commen ts that we considered controversial or significant in the sense of making a difference in th e fundamental way that recovery of the island fox is being approached. Informa tion and comments not incorporated into the final version of the recovery plan we re considered, noted, and are on file with the entire package of agency and public comments. Major comments that were not incorporated or that require additional clarifica tion in addition to their incorporation are addressed below. Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 174 Summary of Comments and Our Responses Comment: One commenter strongly disagree d with the statement on page 84, section 4.4: \"Prevent dist urbance of island ecosystem s' native structure and function to the extent practicable,\" stati ng that, \"island ecosystems are inherently unstable; that is the natural state of th e system. Attempting to impose stability on that system may be legally necessary, but it is not ecologically appropriate and will have unintended consequences.\" Response: We recognize the issues associat ed with trying to maintain an ecosystem at pre-human condition and the difficulty in restoring these affected ecosystems and have modified the text accordingly. We have changed, \"Prevent disturbance of island ecosystems' native structure and function to the extent practicable\" to \"Prevent excessive human-caused impacts to island ecosystems' native structure and f unction to the extent practicable\". We believe the decades of heavy disturbance by human associated ac tivities, including grazing, have altered the landscape over time to such a degree that in order to maintain some stability, actions must be taken to prevent furthe r human induced ecosystem change while stabilizing and restoring, to the ex tent practicable, past human induced disturbances. Comment: One commenter expressed concern that Santa Rosa Island is grouped with the other northern Channel Islands that experienced 'hypermortality' as a result of golden eagle predation, yet th e information provided in the document indicates that while othe r islands have rebounded dramatically, Santa Rosa has not, and over 4 months in late 2006, 10 foxe s (12% of the total population at that time) died of something other than eagl e predation indicating there may be other sources of mortality on Santa Rosa Island that need to be considered. Response: In those cases in which the cause could be determined, the vast majority was golden eagle predation. Predation by golden eagles accounted for 33 of 77 island fox mortalities from 2003-2013 on Santa Rosa Island. The cause of mortality was not determined in 29 cases due to advanced decay of the carcass. Other mortality causes included entrapment in drain pipes (3), intestinal intussusception (collapse of one section of the intestin e into another; 1 case), cholecystitis (inflammation of the gall bladder caused by gallstones, 2 cases), leptospirosis (2), and emaci ation (3, following wounds). Comment: One commenter expressed concern th at the natural source and rate of mortality is nowhere to be found in the document, and that various values are periodically described as hi gh or low, but there is no baseline to compare these numbers. Response: There are very little da ta from fox populations that aren't influenced by catastrophic mortality f actors, except for the rec overing populations without influence by predation/disease. Surviv al has been very hi gh in the recovering populations - 90% and above. The only pr e-decline \"background\" survival rates we are aware of are those from San Mi guel Island in 1993-1994, and those were close to 100% for adults and above 70% for pups (Coonan et al. 2005). On Santa Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 175 Cruz Island, 1993-1994, the survival rate wa s also close to 100% (Roemer et al. 2001). Comment: Two commenters suggested includi ng bald eagle reintroductions as part of the recovery program. Response: We believe bald eagle reintroductio n falls outside the scope of this document. The reintroduction of bald eagles to the Channel Islands began in 1980 on Catalina Island and in 2002 for the northern Channel Islands. Reintroductions to the northern Channel Is lands have been a major focus of the Montrose Settlements Restoration Progr am. While bald eag le reintroductions have benefited the recovery of island f oxes on the northern Channel Islands, these efforts started in 2002, prior to the Fe deral listing which occurred in 2004. Therefore, while we include bald eagle reintroductions as part of the ongoing recovery efforts being conducted for is land foxes, we did not include the reintroduction of bald eagles as a recovery action within the recovery plan since this program was initiated prior to Federal listing. Comment: One commenter expressed concer n about the lack of monitoring within the Long-Term Conservation section given that island systems are always under threat by their isolated nature. Response: We believe that we have appropria tely addressed this concern in the recovery plan. As part of the Long-Te rm Conservation section, we identify the establishment of Conservation Agreemen ts between the land manager(s) and the FWS to address long-term conservation needs, one of which is, \"The land manager's strategy and commitment to c ontinue monitoring island fox subspecies such that any substantial population declin e is detected in a timely manner.\" We believe this is appropriate given that, even with successful mitigation of current threats and the recovery of island fox subs pecies to viable population levels, the intrinsically small population sizes of the subspecies and their insular vulnerabilities subject the different s ubspecies to the continued threat of catastrophic decline from any number of causes. Comment: One commenter asked, \"What evidence is there for bald eagle effects on golden eagles (preventing gol den eagles from nesting)?\" Response: We are not aware of any direct evid ence or studies that address this comment. However, we believe the extirpation of bald eagles ( Haliaeetus leucocephalus ) from the Channel Islands as of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT ) may have facili tated golden eagle colonization. Bald eagles historically bred on the islands and aggression by breeding bald eagles may have discou raged foraging golden eagles from establishing residence. Comment: Two commenters suggested that we should mention in the disease section that the threat of rabies is so gr eat that all fox subspecies are vaccinated against it. Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 176 Response: We have added the following text and believe it is worth mentioning here separately. \"Although rabies has ne ver been found in island wildlife, if it were to occur, there would be no way to effectively mitigate an outbreak. Hence the only defense is a vaccination program.\" Comment: One commenter expressed disagreement with the long-term conservation actions requiring maintenance of a vaccinated subpopulation because these types of actions run counter to the natural in stability of island populations. Response: Although rabies has never been found in island wildlife, if it were to occur, there would be no way to effectively mitigate an outbreak. Hence the only defenses are a vaccination program and a subset of each fox subspecies are vaccinated against it. Furthermore, reducing the threat of disease will require 1) preventing introduction of new pathogens or novel strains of ex isting pathogens to the Channel Islands by eliminating vis itation by mainland animals, and 2) the continuation of the vaccination program s already established on each of the northern Channel Islands and Santa Catalina. Although mainland animal visitation is prohibited on the northern Ch annel Islands, eviden ce exists that dogs are frequently brought to the islands. Th erefore, continued pr oactive vaccination of a core population of island foxes remain s the only viable alternative to protect these populations from CDV and rabies. Additionally, future vaccinations for any delisted subspecies will potentially help prevent the need for relisting under the Endangered Species Act. Comment: One commenter suggested the st atement \"predation by golden eagles remains a threat to the lo ng-term recovery of wild island fox populations\" should be reconsidered in the light of manage ment actions and the resulting lack of breeding by golden eagles on th e islands and greatly redu ced predation by golden eagles on foxes Response: We agree. Timely threat det ection and assessment of appropriate management actions is critical to main tain responsible management of island foxes, which exist in a la ndscape that has been fundamentally altered by human impacts. We have modified the document to reflect this by inserting \"potential.\" The sentence now reads, \"All known golde n eagles have been removed from the northern Channel Islands, yet predation by golden eag les remains a potential threat to the long-term recovery of w ild island fox populations, including in the southern Channel Islands.\" We note, even one pair of nesting golden eagles appears to put significant pr essure on island fox popul ations, whereas island fox populations can sustain some predation by transient eagles, as occurred in 2007- 2013. Thus, golden eagle monitoring and the removal of nesting birds need to continue, and management agencies need to be prepared to respond if and when golden eagles nest on any of the Channel Islands. Comment: One commenter suggested we revise Recovery Criteria 1 that states, \"risk level is sustained fo r at least 5 years, during which time the population trend is not declining\" to include text identi fying what defines a declining trend. Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 177 Response: We agree and have included the fo llowing text to define a declining trend. For the purpose of this recovery pl an, \"A declining trend is defined as the 3-year risk-level being greater in year 5 than year 1.\" Comment: One commenter suggested we m odify Recovery Objective 2 to reflect the reduced likelihood of predation by golden eagles. Response: We agree and have modified the te xt for Recovery Objective 2, from \"Land managers are able to respond in a timely fashion to potential and ongoing predation by golden eagles, to potential or incipient disease outbreaks, and to other identified threats\" to \"Land managers are able to respond in a timely fashion to predation by nesting golden eagles or significant predati on rates by transient golden eagles, to potential or incipient disease outbreaks, and to other identified threats using the best available technology.\" Comment: One commenter suggested that it is counterproductive to develop a formal golden eagle strategy beyond the strategies that have already been successfully developed and implemented. Response: We believe it is still necessary to have a strategy in place and have recommended the existing strategy be includ ed as part of the epidemic response plan. We believe the guidelines set forth for detecting disease-related mortality events is applicable to detecting mort ality of island foxe s by golden eagles. Guidance has been provided on the monitori ng intensity needed to detect threats imposed by golden eagles and disease befo re those threats unduly impact island fox populations. Comment: One commenter suggested the fo llowing text, as described in the Recovery Actions Section, \"Manage capti ve populations of island foxes for recovery\" implies that the r ecovery action is ongoing. Response: To address this comment, we ha ve inserted the following text: \"If required, conduct captive breeding and reintroduction of island foxes to increase population size (captive breeding and reintroduction were conducted from 1999- 2008 and ceased due to the success of re introductions and rapid growth of recovering populations).\" Comment: One commenter disagreed with text that states, \"Quick and accurate detection of possible future declines is paramount to maintaining viable fox populations,\" stating that \"i slands did manage to reta in viable populations through numerous historic bottlenecks, despite documented reductions to <10 individuals in at least one case.\" Response: Based on the complexities associated with island ecosystems and the inherent risks they face, timely threat detection and assessment of appropriate management actions is critical to main tain responsible management of island foxes, which exist in a la ndscape that has been fundamentally altered by human impacts. Guidance has been provided fo r the monitoring intensity needed to detect threats imposed by golden eagles and disease before those threats unduly impact island fox populations. Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 178 Comment: One commenter expressed concern th at the species is being relegated to permanent maintenance, given the fact that new threats to small, island populations will always arise and that once these factors are mitigated to the best of our ability, island fox populations shoul d be allowed to pursue their natural trajectory, even if that means instabil ity and potential extinction on individual islands. Response: We recognize the issues associat ed with trying to maintain an ecosystem at pre-human conditions and the difficulty in restoring these affected ecosystems and have modified the text accordingly. We have changed, \"Prevent disturbance of island ecosystems' native structure and function to the extent practicable\" to \"Prevent excessive human-caused impacts to island ecosystems' native structure and f unction to the extent practicable.\" We believe the decades of heavy disturbance by human associated ac tivities, including grazing, have altered the landscape over time to such a degree that in order to maintain some stability, actions must be taken to prevent future human induced ecosystem change while stabilizing and restoring, to the ex tent practicable, past human induced disturbances. Comment: One commenter expressed concern th at golden eagles being observed but not actively preying upon island foxes w ill be allowed to remain on the island. Response: We have reflected this change in the document which now reads, \"Response tactics (including the use of helicopters a nd net-guns) to capture nesting golden eagles and transient golden eagles re sponsible for significant island fox predation, per the gol den eagle response strategy.\" Comment: One commenter expressed concern about vaccination on Santa Cruz and Santa Catalina Islands being focuse d on one or two localized areas. Response: We agree and have updated the text to reflect this change. On islands where wild fox populations number fewer th an 100 individuals, all island foxes should be vaccinated. On Santa Cruz Is land, vaccination should be focused in one or two localized areas, but specifi cally in primary access corridors, such as Prisoner's Harbor up canyon to the cent ral valley. On Sa nta Catalina Island, vaccination efforts should be concentrat ed around the city of Avalon (where disease introduction is most likely to occur) and around the isthmus (where infection could potentially pass between the eastern and western subpopulations). However, because of the many points of access to Santa Catalina Island, island- wide vaccination is preferred. Comment: One commenter suggested that we not exclude animals killed by trauma from being necropsied, stating that \"disease may predispose an animal to death by other sources, including roadkill.\" Response: We agree. We have removed the language \"from causes other than trauma.\" Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 179 Comment: One commenter recommended that we note that it is not feasible to maintain more than one subspecies as a genetically diverse, sustainable population within mainland Association of Zoos and Aquariums accredited zoos due to space limitations. Response: We believe this is already identified with the existing text, which states, \"may benefit from redundant, geneti cally diverse, and sustainable mainland populations of one or two subspecies.\" Comment: One commenter suggested sections should be updated to reflect the fact that captive breeding and reintroduction has ceased. Response: We agree. We have included text, where appropriate, to reflect this update. An example of text inserted is as follows: \"On-island captive breeding and reintroduction were conducted from 1999-2008 and ceased due to the success of reintroductions and the rapid gr owth of recovering populations.\" Comment: One commenter was unable to find in the document an outline for future serology testing work. The comme nter assumed CDV, CPV, and CAV will be screened for each year, but asked if any others would be screened, such as Leptospirosis and toxoplasma? Response : Appendix 4 \"Guidelines for Vaccination and Sampling of Captive and Wild Populations\" of the Recovery Pl an states, \"Conduct a serosurvey for antibodies to CDV, canine parvovirus (CPV), canine adenovirus (CAV), and Toxoplasma as often as yearly, but no less often than every 5 years. At this time, while leptospirosis is not included in the serology list, it's a pathogen that is monitored for using the post-mo rtem (necropsy) surveillance. Comment: One commenter noted there were some difficulties in comparing seroprevalence across years because differe nt labs/tests were used and inquired whether there is a particular lab that will be used each year or at least a standardized testing protocol. Response: Difficulties in comparing seroprevalence across years may be explained in part by differences in test sensitivities in the labs used for these surveys between 1988 and 2006. Since the 2006 survey, the Island Fox Health Advisory Group recommended Cornell Univer sity serve as the single lab to be used for island fox serology. The lab at Cornell University has been used since that date so that testing is standardized and cross-island comparisons can be made. Comment: One commenter suggested that the subspecies determination for a mainland captive island fox population be consid ered as soon as possible, prior to further investment being made in (and va luable spaces filled by) San Clemente Island foxes. Response: We agree. According to the \"Asse ssment of the potential benefits and costs of long-term captive populations on the mainland and/or islands\" suggests that the Santa Cruz Island fox population would be the best choice, because this subspecies has the most genetic divers ity and the island population is recovering rapidly. Recovery Plan for Four Subspecies of Island Fox 180 Comment: One commenter suggested we add \"Only injured, unreleasable foxes or abandoned pups that are incapable of su rviving in the wild will be considered for transfer to zoos.\" Response : We agree that at one time this was the responsible way for moving forward as a result of the incredibly lo w numbers of individuals present on each island; however, given that space and resources are limite d to establish redundant populations for each of the four endange red subspecies of island fox, it is unrealistic to expect to have a redun dant population of each subspecies. According to the \"Assessment of the poten tial benefits and costs of long-term captive populations on the mainland and/or islands,\" the Santa Cruz Island fox population would be the best choice, because this subspecies has the most genetic diversity and the isla nd fox population is recovering ra pidly. Therefore, based on the long-term conservation st rategy that identifies acti ons that would further the conservation of the island fox, we do not be lieve it is in the best interest at this time to remove island foxes from islands other than Santa Cruz for the genetically diverse mainland captive population. We also believe that in order to establish a genetically diverse mainla nd captive population, we ca nnot rely only on those foxes that are injured, unreleasable, or abandoned pups that are incapable of surviving in the wild; healthy foxes that will best represent and meet the needs for fulfilling this activity will also be necessary. Comment: One commenter agreed that we s hould establish, expand and continue island fox education and outreach program s, but we should add an assessment requirement so the effectiveness of education programs can be ensured. Additionally, the statement that \"All zoos that house island fox populations, particularly those in southern Califor nia should include a robust education program\" leads to difficulty in measuring \"robust.\" Response: We agree and have modified the text accordingly. All zoos that house island fox populations, particul arly those in southern Ca lifornia, should include an education program with an assessment requirement of the education programs effectiveness. An example of an effective program is defined as a 10 percent increase in public awareness, such that 10 percent of visito rs learn that island foxes are unique to the Ch annel Islands and the species ' could be at risk of contracting mainland diseases from mainland animals.
