This phenomenon is called \"weight los s resistance\" (\"WLR\"). Lack of willpower doesn't ade quately explain this experience, as evidenced by people who muster extraordinary discipline with \"diet and exercise\" f or month after month, and yet the weight just doesn't come o ff. While increasing numbers of Americans, both adults and ch ildren, are overweight and want to lose weight, modern medi cine has failed to provide a viable solution. This problem is perpetuated by the industries that feed off this fat epidemic, including the food (diet foods a nd sodas), pharmaceutical and insurance industries. No one drug or fad surgery can really provide opti mal weight, or optimal health. This is because the \"ca use\" of weight loss resistance is multi-factorial, or web-l ike. The Problem with \"Diet and Exercise\" \"Diet and exercise\", is clearly unsuccessful in th e long- term for the vast majority. This is because it fla wed in its conception. As we are learning, \"diet\" does not wo rk, because when we restrict calories, the body's metabolism ad justs and eventually becomes even more resistant to weight lo ss. Over 90% of people who \"diet\" are heavier five years lat er. This concept of diet is being slowly replaced by \"lifest yle\", which means that we re-construct for ourselves a new sust ainable way of shopping, cooking, eating, sleeping and exer cising (see below). However, there remains confusion about wha t and how to eat (see below). While \"exercise\" is necessary for optimal health, the type and intensity of exercise advocated for weight loss and maintenance has inherent problems. The first is th at most forms of \"aerobic\" exercise essentially trade-in a joint for fat. After a few years of running, biking or swimming, o r even use of the newer machines, people begin to \"burn out\" t heir knees, backs, shoulders or necks. This is due to the un-n atural repetitive motion several times per week, as well a s other factors discussed below. Intense aerobics also produces free-radicals, the sparks that ignite inflammation and block weight loss. The Hormonal Connection Another problem with intense aerobics is the way t he body interprets this activity, leading to a conditi on called \"adrenal fatigue\" (see prior article in Yoga Living ). 20,000 years ago, we only did \"aerobics\" when we were bein g chased by lions or running from natural disaster. After a period of such intense activity, an early human would either rest or rest- in-peace (!). Our pets live this way--periods of i ntense activity, followed by even longer periods of rest. Humans are also designed to vary their activities with the sea sons, becoming more and less active as the days get longe r and shorter. In addition, when we watch an Indiana Jon es movie, the body thinks it is being chased by natives--it c annot distinguish a movie from reality. So we go from st ressor to stressor, 16 hours a day, without a change of seaso n. In response to this stress, the adrenal glands put out several \"fight or flight\" hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol . While very helpful in short bursts, these hormones in the long-term raise blood sugar, raise blood pressure, damage mus cle, bone, joints and skin, suppress the immune system, impair the gastro-intestinal (\"GI\") system, and alter sleep an d neurotransmitter balance. Adrenal hormones also have an intimate relationshi p with sex and thyroid hormones, so they can cause or be a ffected by thyroid disease, birth control pills and peri-menop ause, making WLR more problematic. Finally. we are learn ing more about the sugar/fat modulating hormones, inclu ding insulin, glucagon, leptin (made by the fat cells th emselves) and others. They interact with all the other hormones discussed above, so true health requires a global approach to the hormonal systems of the body. Inflammation and Toxicity as Major Missing Links Inflammation is a natural fire that the body uses to dis- assemble tissues and kill internal predators. It w orks through multiple chemical mediators, such as prostaglandins and cytokines. However, if the inflammation process do es not turn off, it begins to alter our metabolism and cause WL R. One major cause of chronic inflammation is chronic toxi city. Toxins are substances and activities that \"poison\" the body. There are several types, including chemical, biological, physical, and psycho-spiritual. We can also think of them as \"exo-toxins\", coming from outside the body, and \"en do- toxins\", coming from within. Chemical toxins include: heavy metals, pesticides, drugs (legal and illegal), alcohol, cigarette smoke, and certain substances made by the liver. Biological toxins in clude certain foods, bacteria, yeast and parasites, and t heir waste products. Psycho-spiritual toxins include chronic anger, anxiety, negative thoughts, addictions and unhealth y mental practices. While each toxin individually may be sa fe or manageable, the total load (we now carry as many as 300 modern chemicals in our body) can overwhelm our nat ural detoxification systems. The interaction of multipl e toxins is called \"the cocktail effect\". These toxins poison our enzymes, which are needed to de- activate other toxins, generate energy, burn fat an d build tissue, to name just a few functions. Toxins also damage the integrity of our GI tract leading to malabsorption, leaky gut, constipation and further toxicity. These dysfuncti ons then confuse the immune system, leading to allergy, recu rrent infection, and autoimmune disease. Sleep deprivation or poor quality sleep can be con sidered a toxin in itself, as it has clear effects on metab olism and inflammation. The sum total of these conditions stoke the fire o f inflammation that smolders in our brains, blood ves sels, joints, skin and organs, and confuses our hormonal systems. As we get older, we accumulate more and more of th ese toxins in our bones, muscle and fat. Losing weight (and other activities) causes a release of these toxins from t hese tissue banks back into our circulation, essentially poison ing ourselves from within, causing worsening inflammati on. In some ways, getting older, i.e. getting arthritic, d emented, depressed, osteoporotic, bald and fat, can be simpl y thought of as the accumulated damage from these toxins and inflammation. The good news is that we can reverse this toxicity and the resulting inflammation starting at any age. With s trategic detoxification and lifestyle change, we can slow do wn and even reverse aging and WLR. Toxic Foods and Food Allergy Besides the clear toxicity of commercial foods, wi th pesticides, artificial hormones, antibiotics, genet ically modified proteins (60% of soy and corn) and chemica lly manipulated nutrients (such as high-fructose corn s yrup), another important consideration is that of allergy and intolerance. Many of us are allergic to one or several foods. The biggest culprits are: sugar, dairy, wheat and glute n and soy. This is in part because of over-exposure since earl y childhood, as well as the fact that these foods are not the sa me as they were 10, 100, or 1000 years ago. Many people aren' t aware of 5/11/08-5 wlr_af.wpf \"Weight Loss Resistance\" M Cheikin MD Page 2 these allergies, or intolerance, because the body a dapts, as it does to a toxic job or home environment. However, after a period of vacation from these toxins, their re-intr o-duction may demonstrate a clear deterioration in health. A n elimination and then re-challenge is often more dia gnostic than skin, blood or energy tests for allergy. Dairy is a highly controversial and important toxin/allergen since it has been highly marketed as a good source of calcium, protein and vitamin D, and helpf ul for weight loss. The Weight-Watchers program, one of t he most successful diet/lifestyle plans, is heavily based o n dairy. However, there is growing evidence that dairy in mo st forms is pro-inflammatory (see Campbell's book). When one consumes an allergenic food on a regular basis, even a small amount, this stokes the immune system to produce inflammation and also calls on the adrenal glands to produce cortisol and adrenaline. Therefore, eating an allergenic food in and of itself may be a major cau se of WLR. Some people are lucky to find that elimination of just one food, such as dairy, wheat or coffee allows weight to begin to drop off without any other changes in lifestyle. M ost people will need a more comprehensive approach, however. Lastly, there is a growing convergence of opinion that the optimal diet should emphasize organic food, green v egetables, colored fruits, seeds and nuts, less grains (especi ally processed ones), more water and more raw foods. Food process ing and cooking can destroy up to 80% of nutritional value. Victoria Bourtenko's book distinguishes between feeling full vs feeling satisfied. The common habit of looking through the cabinets after finishing a meal suggests that the body is lo oking for something that is missing from the Standard America n Diet (\"SAD\"). Like building a house without nails or with substa ndard pipes, lacking just one critical nutrient or consum ing altered nutrients may cause subtle or serious illness which tends to worsen over time. The Unique Role of Yoga While most exercise is stress-producing, classic y oga, with it's meditative quality, is one of the few for ms of exercise that provide stretch, strength, and at the same tim e can re- balance hormonal and neuro-transmitter systems. Th e trick is to do yoga gently, not aggressively. It also is po rtable, cheap and does not utilize the repetitive unnatural movem ent of aerobic machines. Yoga also allows us to explore o ur thought processes, which are always involved in weight issu es. Steps Toward Reversing Weight Loss Resistance Based on the above, the following steps can be eff ective for a sustainable lifestyle with optimal health and weight: 1. Get informed. Read and learn. Be critical of concepts that have been drilled in since childhood. 2. Get real. Take an honest assessment of where you are with your weight, diet and lifestyle. Clarify your prio rities and identify the obstacles that get in your way (see Ho bbs book on time management). 3. Get inspired. Methods to stoke your enthusiasm for health include journaling, joining a yoga class, and findi ng friends and a community that support your efforts. On the other hand, find ways to defend yourself against those who may sabotage your efforts, including family members and co-worke rs. 4. Get help . Find a knowledgeable and like-minded practitioner who can do the proper tests and provid e objective feedback. 5. Get tested. Evaluate toxins and allergies using the best methods available. Even if some are not \"covered\" by insurance--this investment is like fixing your car or home; and without it, you can waste time and money. 6. Get prepared. Design a comprehensive program that involves: healthy foods, supplements, gentle aerobics, gentle yoga, journaling, support people, and a regular sch edule or ritual that keeps your momentum going. Some people like to make one change at a time; others plan for a month or two and then implement a comprehensive program all at once. 7. Get started. Make a commitment to a new way of eating and living. In opposition to fast foods, the \"slow food\" movement emphasizes the importance and privilege of preparing our meals using organic local foods. By applying these principles, health will improve and weight will stabilize naturally.
