Witnessed his getting better and in less pain, I asked her help with my embarrassed problem of frequent urination in night sleep. Before treatment, I often got up every 3 hours. Now, I can sleep through 6 hours. It is great improvement to my daily sleep and I feel much energetic. Thank you, Wendy. I recommend her wholeheartedly. She's the best, fighting back pain for a while and she does magic, very professional, knowledgeable, I have no words to describe my gratitude. Highly recommended. Mar Gio My 83 years old Mom got shingles last December, though she was able to take anti-virus prescription medicine within 48 hours after the rash developed, the rash expanded very fast to her entire legs and bottoms, and the severer nerve pain she suffered got worse each day. It was very scary to us and the doctor said it could take a few weeks before it gets better, for many patients, especially for the elderly, the lingering pain could last for months or even years. So we decided to try acupuncture with Dr. Li, as we heard/learned that's probably the most effective treatment to stop shingle nerve pain. We prepared for a lengthy treatment when we started acupuncture with Dr. Li. At the first treatment, in addition to acupuncture, Dr. Li also applied some external medicine on the rashes. The rash blisters quickly dried in the next couple of days. My mom said the pain eased a little it and the burning pain stroke less frequently. On the third day, we had the second treatment with Dr. Li. It was UNBELIEAVABLE that my Mom said that though she still felt pain on the way home, the pain was almost gone at the night! The next day she woke up pain free!!! That's a miracle!! We didn't expect that acupuncture could work so fast and I talked to some friends who have family members treated shingles with other acupuncture doctors, none of them totally got rid of shingles pain in just TWO treatments! Even a high school friend of mine in China, whose mother also got shingles earlier last year, told me that her mother was treated with the very experienced acupuncture doctor in China and was recovered after a few month. Thank you so much Dr. Li for your highly skilled, precise acupuncture treatment! I could not imagine otherwise how much my 83-year-old Mom would suffer. For anyone who seeks treatment on shingles or other areas with acupuncture, I highly recommend Dr. Li. I came to Wendy after trying different options treating my vertigo problem. and now I feel so much better! I even brought my husband and Wendy also helped him as well. Wendy is not only a good professional but also very positive and nice person! thank you! Svetlana zaretsky When I first came to Wendy, I had not have a menstrual cycle in nearly 2 years. I was getting headaches and having shoulder pain. After seeing her for only 3 months, somewhat regularly, I started on a healthy menstrual cycle and no longer needed to come as regularly. I have been told by western medical doctors I should be on hormonal pill and it would likely be difficult to conceive. I am so grateful for Wendy's help in my journey back to feeling healthy and feminine again! Thank you! M.D 11/21/2019 I brought my mom to Wendy after she tried everything to reduce her pain due to sciatica nerve clamp. My mom felt much better after the first session with Wendy. I recommend everyone with any kind of pain to come here and try acupuncture. It is really amazing what Wendy can do. Elvira, 9/28/2019 I have been coming to Wendy from last two months. I used to take 25 to 30 pain killers per month. Now I take 3 or 4 in a month. Migraines have come down a lot. I used to have migraines for 20 days a month. Now I get 3 times a month. I really feel blessed that I came to Wendy. I truly recommend to people who suffer to at least try. You will for sure benefit. S. Anitha 9/21/19 I have been coming to see Weihui here for over two years now. She always listens to my concerns, takes care of a problem. Something it might be just a tune up. Her personality brings a lot of calm into my life. A.S. 8/3/2019 8/10/19 Turned to acupuncture + herbs for chronic cough with the use of cupping, scraping, acupuncture + herbs, I noticed an improvement in my cough + in the clearing of my throat. I will continue treatment hoping I can strength my lungs etc so that this is almost unnoticeable. Karen I have been coming here for over 2 years. I have had 3 surgeries in that time. She has help me recover and go on to lead a wonderful life. She is very caring and also gives me learning lessons about life as we go through my treatments on a weekly basis. I will continue to come. My over all well being both physical of spiritual is fantastic. Shawn 7/13/19 I really love coming in to see Wendy. Her acupuncture relieves stress and makes my back pain much more bearable. She also has helped with my digestion by settling my stomach. You should definitely try her treatments. WB As for my first experience with acupuncture therapy, I am very pleased with so far positive results. I came to Wendy 6 months ago with severe lower back pain (mostly at night), indigestion symptoms, autoimmune system problems (uveitis lichen sclerosis), menstrual irregularities, and acne on my face. In the past 6 months, my back pain subside from level 10 to 4, no significant stomach issue at this time, as well as enjoying acne on my face is gone. I feel very blessed to find this alternative form of healing although it should be my first choice. I made numerous visits to western medicine doctors.
