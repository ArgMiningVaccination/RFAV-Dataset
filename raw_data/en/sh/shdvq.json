The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices issued recommendations for an additional primary mRNA COVID -19 vaccine dose for immunocompromised persons and a COVID -19 vaccine booster dose in eligible groups.

On November 2, 2021, after a systematic review of available data, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices made an interim recommendation for use of the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 vaccine in children aged 5- 11 years in the United States for prevention of COVID -19. The Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 vaccine has high efficacy (>90%) against COVID -19 in children aged 5- 11 years, and benefits outweigh risks for vaccination. Vaccination is important to protect children against COVID -19 and reduce community transmission of SARS-CoV -2.Source: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7045e1.htmCOVID- 19 vaccine safety publications Surveillance for Adverse Events After COVID -19 mRNA Vaccination.

If PCV15 is used, this should be followed by a dose of PPSV23. -Adults aged 19 years of age or older with certain underlying medical conditions or other risk factors who have not previously received a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine or whose previous vaccination history is unknown should receive a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (either PCV20 or PCV15). If PCV15 is used, this should be followed by a dose of PPSV23.Influenza Vaccines There were two presentations: -Phase II safety and study of the coadministration of Fluzone \u00ae HighDose Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine and -1273 COVID-19 vaccine ( Moderna) -Cell culture -based inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV4) now FDA approved for ages 6 months Five IIV4s are now approved for this age groupHepatitis B Vaccines ACIP voted for the following recommendations: -The ACIP recommends the following groups should receive hepatitis B vaccines Adults 19 through 59 years Adults 60 years and older with risk factors for hepatitis B infection -The ACIP recommends the following groups may receive hepatitis B vaccines Adults 60 years and older without known risk factors for hepatitis B infectionOrthopoxviruses Vaccines The genus Orthopoxvirus contains a number of species, such as smallpox and monkeypox. ACIP voted for five recommendations for the use of the JYNNEOS\u00ae vaccine for persons who are at risk for occupational exposure -laboratory personnel and for designated response team members -healthcare personnel who administer ACAM2000 or care for patients infected with replication competent orthopoxvirusesEbola vaccine ACIP voted for two recommendations for the use of the rVSV G-ZEBOV -GP vaccine -Pre-exposure vaccination with rVSVG -ZEBOV -GP vaccine is recommended for healthcare personnel involved in the care and transport of suspect or confirmed Ebola virus disease patients at Special Pathogens Treatment Centers -Pre-exposure vaccination with rVSV G-ZEBOV -GP vaccine is recommended for laboratorians and support staff at Laboratory Response Network (LRN) facilities that handle specimens that may contain replication competent Ebola virus (species Zaire ebolavirus ) in the United StatesFor more information, The findings and conclusions in this report are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the official position of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Thank You "}
