Using crystals as a form of [self-care](https://www.oprahdaily.com/life/health/g25939272/self-care-tips/) have particularly risen in popularity, appearing all over Instagram, on the shelves of yoga studios, and perhaps even on your coworker's desk. For starters, proponents believe that crystals are conduits for the healing energy of the earth when used correctly. \"Crystals emit positive, uplifting, energizing, and calming vibrations that help you achieve a more peaceful mind and a revitalized physical state of being,\" explains Heather Askinosie, co-founder of [Energy Muse](https://www.energymuse.com/), an online crystal shop. [Each crystal is said to have a different effect](https://www.oprahdaily.com/life/a35045011/types-of-crystals/) on the mind and body. Crystals' vibrations are said to arise from the unique way their atoms and molecules move and interact, says Amy Mercree, holistic health expert and author of [The Mood Book: Crystals, Oils, and Rituals to Elevate Your Spirit](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1454933186). These vibrations and energies can then supposedly affect our human bodies\u2014and minds. \"Our bodies are dynamic, electromagnetic organisms\u2014we have physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual energy flowing through us all the time,\" Mercree says. \"Crystals are a fun and unique way to help direct and influence that energy towards greater health when used with the right intention.\" Although it may sound a bit, err, bohemian, our ancestors have valued crystals for ages. \"Humans have used stones for healing and energetic purposes for thousands of years,\" explains [Keveney Avila](https://www.keveneyevanne.com/), an animal intuitive and certified practitioner in energy mastery. According to Avila, ancient Egyptians used crystals for healing and protection; sacred Indian texts explain specific healing properties of various crystals and how to use them to treat illnesses; Chinese medicine often includes the use of crystals; and ancient Greeks and Romans used crystals for protection in battle and in medical treatment\u2014just to name a few examples. So perhaps it's not so far-fetched that in modern days, we're turning to the potential healing powers of crystals and stones. Or is it? First, what do healing crystals do? \"There's no scientific research that backs up the claim that crystals can be used to cure disease,\" says Navya Mysore, MD, a primary care physician and medical director of [One Medical](https://www.onemedical.com/). Because illnesses are not caused by negative energy or wavelengths, crystals technically can't cure disease in the way that crystal proponents explain, she says. However, let's not disregard the power of crystals so fast. While there's no scientific evidence that they can fix medical conditions, they could have some mental and even physical benefits thanks to the so-called placebo effect, Mysore notes. \"Similar to the way we put faith in the power of prayer and other religious beliefs, placing hope in healing stones may not be so far-fetched.\" While it can get a bad rap, the placebo effect is real, Mysore says. The benefits of the placebo effect are strongly supported by [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3602922/). Plus, the power of positive thinking\u2014whether related to possibly-powerful rocks or not\u2014has been shown to affect health outcomes in patients who are going through treatments. Plus, crystals probably aren't doing you any harm. Unless you're overspending on an expensive therapeutic treatment or only relying on crystals to boost your well-being, Mysore says that adding some gems to your life [can increase your positive energy](https://www.oprahdaily.com/life/health/a25655113/how-to-be-more-positive/) and [confidence](https://www.oprahdaily.com/life/health/a27310247/how-to-be-more-confident/), or remind you of an intention. The bottom line: Consider crystals something to add to your healing toolkit, as Suzanne Monroe, founder of [The International Association of Wellness Professionals](https://iawpwellnesscoach.com/about-us/) and author of [The Holistic Cookbook & Lifestyle Guide](https://wellnesscoachconnect.com/product/the-holistic-cookbook-lifestyle-guide/), suggests. Like anything related to your health and wellness\u2014from green juice to [yoga](https://www.oprahdaily.com/life/health/g31672490/best-yoga-apps/) to [meditation](https://www.oprahdaily.com/life/health/g29861798/best-meditation-apps/)\u2014crystals can be an addition to your routine, but not a substitute for a doctor's orders nor a be-all, end-all solution. Our well-being can't only be summed up by numbers and data, Monroe notes. \"And if crystals can support us in a way that we can't see but we can feel, isn't that powerful enough?\" How to choose your crystals: Ready to dabble in the purported powers of these stones? The first step to working with crystals is to determine your most immediate health or wellness needs, like easing anxiety or increasing serenity, and choose a crystal accordingly (more on that below). Crystals are used in many different ways. Some, like rose quartz, make beautiful accent pieces in your home and create a loving atmosphere. Crystals can also be worn as necklaces or other types of jewelry\u2014and with colors ranging from green to black to pink, you're sure to find an option that matches your mood and wardrobe. Others exert their calming powers when you carry them with you, while there's a variety you'll want to hold while meditating or practicing deep breathing. Keep reading to figure out which kind of crystal would be best for you. Clear Quartz This neutral energy conductor is a great stone for beginners. It can add more energy and charge to your intentions while meditating. Black Tourmaline This protective stone purportedly helps to block negative energy from entering your space or impacting your own personal energy, Askinosie says. Place this crystal by your front door, on your desk, or in the four corners of a room to protect your environment. Amethyst Whether you're looking for solace from a busy day or help falling asleep, amethyst offers calming energy, Askinosie says. Try placing it in your bedroom for relaxing vibes. Citrine This bright, sunny stone radiates joy, happiness and light, Askinosie says. \"When you're feeling down, reach for citrine as a reminder to tap into your inner happiness.\" Aquamarine \"These stones can help you speak your truth, especially when worn as a necklace, by amplifying the energy of your throat chakra,\" Mercree says. They can assist with creative projects, and also they're said to be a good accessory if you're having a difficult conversation. Rose Quartz Known as the stone of love, rose quartz can help open your heart up to all types of romance, Askinosie says. \"Hold it over your heart to align it with the energy of love.\" Keep it in the bedroom, for obvious reasons. Tiger Eye \"This stone is very grounding, which helps you be present in your physical body,\" Mercree notes. It's said to help improve athletic performance. Try wearing this bracelet when you need an extra oomph to get through a tough yoga class. Moonstone Astrologer Lisa Stardust says that moonstone hearkens new beginnings by inspiring us to get in touch with our truest nature and emotions. It helps the heart and sacral chakra to be open to new opportunities and possibilities. Green Calcite Stardust calls green calcite a \"road opener\" crystal, which gives a boost of energetic fuel when we're feeling stuck. The crystal, which encourages transformation through healing, is said to ease the blockages that may be keeping us from growing. Pink Opal Are you one to get easily riled up? If so, Stardust recommends pink opal, whose properties include releasing anger and tension. You're a stone's throw away from serenity. Kyanite Stardust says this dusky blue stone can help bolster the mind-body link. The stone is said to help foster intuition, useful for daily life or for that [burgeoning tarot practice](https://www.oprahdaily.com/life/a35325092/tarot-for-beginners/). Pyrite Per Stardust, pryite is an all-purpose stone, bringing \"protection on all levels.\" It's especially helpful in warding off \" [energy vampires](https://www.oprahdaily.com/life/relationships-love/a29623497/energy-vampires/),\" or people who drain you. Selenite The crystal supposedly clears out the day's accrued bad vibes and envelops you in a more peaceful flow of energy. For an instant boost, wave the selenite wand around you (or around a friend who's having a hard day). Okay, you've got your precious stones. Now what? Regardless of which one you choose, make sure to \"charge\" your crystal by letting it sit in a sunny window sill or outside in direct sunlight or moonlight for at least four hours, Mercree says. \"Soaking up sunlight and moonlight helps your crystals hold more energy,\" she explains. Then, in the same way that you need a sense of direction in order to be most productive, so does your crystal, Askinosie says. \"Giving your crystal a job allows you to set your intention for the work you'll do together.\" When setting your intention, try to get specific as possible, suggests Askinosie. If you're trying to bring more energy into your life, visualize how you would feel with that added boost. If you're trying to cultivate more peace, think calming thoughts. To \"program\" your crystal, Askinosie recommends sitting quietly, holding the stones in both of your hands, and thinking about your goal. \"The stone then absorbs your intention, and becomes activated,\" she says. You can then use the crystal in whatever way works for you, such as wearing it as jewelry, placing it in your desk or on a windowsill, or simply holding it in your hand every time you need to be reminded of your intention. As Askinosie notes, no matter your goals, all crystals can help you on your journey toward better well-being when used with intention. For example, perhaps your intention is to speak up for yourself more at work, or maybe you purchased a rose quartz crystal to invite romance into your life. Think of your crystal as a touchstone \u2014 both literally and figuratively\u2014that can help you remember your purpose as you go about your daily life.
