One thing is for certain, you can't afford to be let down by low immunity when you need to train, compete and chase PB's. Fortunately Nature's Best have a range supplements and vitamins to help you boost your immune system so you can ensure you get all the support your body needs to carry on working at peak performance levels. Multivitamins Cover all your bases with a multi-vitamin, but do make sure it is made with the specific needs of athletes and physically active people in mind. Our Multi-Guard\u00ae Sport is ideal as it combines all the vitamins and minerals your body needs. We also include some fantastic extras which aren't always found in even the most complete multi's, such as magnesium, which helps hard working muscles relax and can promote better sleep and recovery, and a full spectrum of antioxidants to buffer free radicals created by training and exercise. Vitamin C The harder you train, the higher your body's demand for vitamin C. We offer sports people two equally fantastic choices: high dose tablets (which also include bioflavonoids and rosehip) that release 1000mg slowly throughout the day to keep your immune system topped up with this important vitamin, or a 500mg dosage for more sensitive systems or smaller athletes. Vitamin C is a staple vitamin to boost the immune system, so make sure yours is of the highest quality and efficacy. Vitamin D3 Living in the UK, we have more need for vitamin D3 supplements than most. The body cannot create vitamin D without substantial amounts of sun exposure, and cannot store it either, meaning that our grey days and long winters leave us deficient in this important vitamin. Vitamin D supports the immune system and also contributes to long-term bone health, absolutely critical if you want to carry on training, competing and enjoying your sport long into the Masters category. Echinacea Vitamins can help you strengthen and support your immune system, but what immune system supplement should you take if you're feeling the early effects of a cold or other mild infection? Our Echinacea cold and flu relief tablets are a natural, very effective way to boost the immune system without taking any remedies which could leave you too drowsy to train (or risk your natural status, if you are a drug-tested athlete). Using the power of nature to fight against infection, this traditional herbal immunity booster is the perfect supplement to turn to when you feel the first signs of a cold, cough or sniffle. There's no downtime in sport, so you need supplements which support and protect your immune system all year round.
