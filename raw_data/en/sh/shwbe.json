There seems to be a general assumption that the synergistic therapeutic effects of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) derive from the complex interactions between the multiple bioactive components within the herbs and/or herbal formulations. However, evidence to support these synergistic effects remains weak and controversial due to several reasons, including the very complex nature of CHM, misconceptions about synergy and methodological challenges to study design. In this review, we clarify the denition of synergy, identify common errors in synergy research and describe current methodological approaches to test for synergistic interaction. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of these models in the context of CHM and summarize the current status of synergy research in CHM. Despite the availability of some scientic data to support the synergistic effects of multi-herbal and/or herb-drug combinations, the level of evidence remains low, and the clinical relevancy of most of these ndings is undetermined. There remain signicant challenges in the development of suitable methods for synergistic studies of complex herbal combinations. Keywords: synergy, Chinese herbal medicine, interaction, isobologram, combination index, system biology INTRODUCTION The \"one drug, one target, one disease\" approach has for some time remained the conventional pharmaceuticalapproachtothedevelopmentofmedicinesandtreatmentstrategies.However,over the last decade, this mono-substance therapy model has gradually shifted toward the adoption of combination therapies, in which multiple active components are employed. This paradigm shift has been partly driven by its limited eectiveness in chronic diseases, treatment resistance, and sideeectsofsyntheticmono-drugs.Recentevidencehasdemonstratedthatcombinationtherapy could provide greater therapeutic benets to diseases such as AIDS, cancer, atherosclerosis and diabetes, all of which possess complex etiology and pathophysiology and therefore are dicult toZhou et al. Synergy in Chinese Herbal Medicine treat using single drug target approach ( Devita et al., 1975; Chesney et der Hoorn, 2004; Weber andNoels,2011 ).Moreover,advancesinanalyticalchemistryand molecular biology methods have broadened our understandin g of therapeutic targets of diseases and potential multi-targe t treatment approaches. Signicant progress has been made in the study of synergistic eects of drugs. For instance, a rece nt studyhasdemonstratedthesynergisticeectofthecombinat ion of metformin and aspirin in treating pancreatic cancer ( Yue et al., 2014 ). In parallel, research into synergistic interactions of multi-componentherbalpreparationsandtheirinteractionsw ith pharmaceutical drugs has also attracted great interest in re cent years. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been used over thousands of years for the management of disease, maintenan ce of health, and prolongation of life expectancy in China and other Asian countries such as Japan and Korea. Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) is a key modality of TCM, in which up to 20 herbs are used in combination in a complex herbal formulation . Substantial progress has been made over the last decades in th e study of ecacy and mode of actions of some commonly used herbs and formulations ( Lam et al., 2006; Kong et al., 2009 ). However,evidencetosupportsynergisticeectsofmultipleher bs andtheiractivecomponentsremainscontroversial.Forexam ple, some studies have suggested that meaningful synergistic an d therapeutic eects of herbal formulations were unlikely due t o the low/extremely low levels of active components existed in the herbs ( Williamson, 2001; Danz et al., 2002 ). This has led to skepticism that herbal therapies are merely placebo eects (Tausk, 1998 ). In contrast, numerous studies have demonstrated thatherbal extractsasa whole and/ormultiple herbs incomplex formulations oer better ecacies than equivalent doses of individual active ingredients and/or herbs when used alone , highlighting the signicance of synergistic action in herb al therapies ( Leonard et al., 2002; Scholey and Kennedy, 2002; Zhang et al., 2014 ). In this article, we aim to present a comprehensive review of the current status of research on the synergisticeectsofCHMandhowtheyareeectivelymeasured. DEFINITION OF SYNERGY Generally, synergy is dened as the interaction of two or mor e agents to produce a combined eect greater than the sum of their individual eects ( van Vuuren and Viljoen, 2011 ). In medicinal research eld, however, the understanding of syn ergy is complicated. Spinella (2002) has classied the concept of synergy broadly into two main categories based on the mode of actions\u2014pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic synergy (Spinella, 2002 ). The rst type of synergy describes two or more agents that work on the same receptors or biological targets that result in enhanced therapeutic outcomes throug h their positive interactions. The second type of synergy resul ts from interactions between two or more agents during their pharmacokineticprocesses(absorption,distribution,metab olism and elimination) leading to changes of the agents quantitat ively inthebodyandhencetheirtherapeuticeects( Spinella,2002 ).TheconceptofsynergyisanintrinsicpartofTCMphilosophy and is often described in a more holistic way. The complex synergistic interactions among the herbs in complex CHM formulations (Fufang) are believed to be able to enhance the bioavailability of active components, promote therapeuti c eects, and/or reduce toxicity ( Jia et al., 2004 ). The design of herbal formulations follows the principle of compatibility , called \"Peiwu,\" which requires the considerations of dieren t interrelationships of herbal ingredients including synerg ism (Xiang Xu), assisting (Xiang Shi), detoxication (Xiang Sha and Xiang Wei), antagonism (Xiang Wu), and rejection (Xiang Fan) (Jia et al., 2004 ). Based on this principle, dierent herbs are combined following \"Jun-Chen-Zuo-Shi\" (also known as \"Emperor-Minister-Assistant-Courier\")ruletoachievedes irable eectsand/ortominimizeside-eects.\"Jun\"isthemainherbin a herbalformulawitharelativelyhigherratiodirectlytarg etingthe disease;\"Chen\"isanadjuvantherbtopromotetherapeuticeec t of the to target the accompanying symptoms; \"Zuo\" isusuallyusedforreducingtheside-eectsoftheherbalfor mula; \"Shi\" is the herb that guides the active ingredients to reach the targetorgansortoharmonizetheiractions. It is important not to confuse synergistic eect with additive eect. Synergy occurs when two or more drugs/compounds are combined to produce a total eect that is greater than the sum of the individual agents ( Chou, 2010; Breitinger, 2012 ), while an additive eect is an add up of individual eects where each individual agent is not aecting the other (no interactions). The concept that the additive eect of two drugs is their \"arithmet ic sum\" is a misconception. The additive eect is not simply the sum of the eects of A plus B. For instance, if agents A and B exert an inhibitory eect as 60 and 70% at certain dosage level , respectively,itisincorrecttostatetheiradditiveeectis1 30%at this dosage. The additive eect needs to be determined using a morecomplexmathematicalalgorithmequation. Comparing combination activity to individual activity at th e samedosageoreectlevelisacommonerrorinsynergystudies . A large amount of papers were found to report synergistic eect when the ED 50value of a combination was signicantly lower than that of each individual component with a P<0.05. This approach seems logical, but it actually cannot distinguis h between an additive eect and a synergistic eect as it is still th e comparisonbetweencombinationandindividualeects.Simil ar errors are very common in animal and clinical trials where it is dicult to apply rigorous synergy determining methods due to practical reasons (e.g., costs, curation of the study, ethi cal issues, etc). In these studies, researchers estimated syne rgism by simply comparing the eect of the combination with that of individual components, which unfortunately would lead to a wrong conclusion. Thus, more ecient and practical models need to be developed to determine synergistic eects of multi- componentpreparationsinanimalandhumanstudies. METHODS TO QUANTIFY SYNERGY Currently, no unied methodology is available for synergy research to facilitate the dierent understandings of the mod e Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org 2 July 2016 | Volume 7 | Article 201Zhou et al. Synergy in Chinese Herbal Medicine of action of synergy; this has led to the question that whethe r the drug interactions observed are genuine synergistic eec ts (Chou,2010 ).However,severalmethodologicalapproacheshave been developed and combinational drug therapies. Loewe additivity and Bliss independent are the two oldest and major reference classes for synergy studies in the last f ew decades ( Tang et al., 2015 ). Loewe additivity is usually applied for the case where the drugs have similar modes of action on the same target or pathway (pharmacokinetic) ( Tang et al., 2015). In contrast, the Bliss independence model is expected to hold truth for non-interacting drugs that elicit their respo nses independently (pharmacodynamic) ( Tang et al., 2015 ). In recent years, many other methods based on these two models have been developed and adapted for the study of synergistic eects of multi-component preparations. Some of the most popular models including the combination index and isobole method (both derived from Loewe additivity), systems biology analys is (used for multi-target synergy), and several specic assays for synergisticstudiesofantimicrobialagentsarediscussed here.The strengths and limitations of these methods are summarized i n Table1. Combination Index Recently it has been demonstrated that synergy follows physicochemical mass-action law, which briefly states that t he ratio between the concentration of reactants and products is constant for a chemical reaction mixture that is in equilibri um. From mass-action law, a simplied mathematic equation for the combination index (CI) was further developed for the quantitative determination of synergy in multiple agents ac ting on the same target/receptor ( Chou, 2010 ). Synergism occurs whentheCIvalueis <1(themoretheCIvalueapproaches0,the strongerthesynergisticeect);additiveeectoccurswhent heCI value is equals to 1, and antagonism happens when the CI value is>1. TheCIisapracticalmodelusedfortheanalysisofsynergyof amulti-componentcombinationinaxedratio.Tocalculatet he CI,thedose-responsecurves(inhibitoryeect,stimulatory eect, etc.) of individual components A and B and their combination in a xed ratio are determined using the same assay. The doses of each individual component that achieves a specied eect (e.g. 50%, ED 50) are determined. Further, the doses of A and B required in the combination to produce the same level of eect can be calculated. Then, based on the doses, the synergism/addition/antagonism is calculated accordi ng to Equation (1) below for two agents and Equation (2) for multipl e agents. In addition, computer software including \"CalcuSyn\" and its third-generation \"CompuSyn\" have been developed, which greatly facilitates the CI analysis ( Patrick Reynolds and Maurer, 2005; Chou, 2006 ). By inputting the dose-eect data of agents 1 and 2 and their combination, the software can generate a Fa (eect level)-CI curve, which demonstrates a complete dataset of CI values (represent antagonistic/additive/syn ergistic interactions) at all tested doses. Also, a CI-Fa (eect level s) can be generated (an example is shown in Figure1). This model can also be applied for the determination of interaction samong multiple agents in a mixture. The calculation is based on Equation (2), which demonstrates n-drug combination at x% inhibition. Examples using CI model for the determination of synergistic interaction in CHM are discussed in Section Synergistic Interactions within Single Herb Analyzed by CI to produceachoseneectlevel(usuallyED 50) d1tod2=thedosesofindividualconstituentinthecombination requiredtoproducethesameeect,respectively. It is worth mentioning that many studies also reported a synergistic eect when certain pharmacological eects can be observed with a drug combination, but not with one or more of itsindividualcomponents.Thiseectisclassiedaspotentiat ion or augmentation rather than synergism based on Chou's theory (Chou, 2010 ). If an individual component does not generate an eect when used alone, the D1 value is equals to 0, thus the synergy cannot be determined in the CI equations. This potentiation or augmentation eect can be considered as a form ofcomplementaryinteractions. Isobole Method Isobologram, was rst introduced by Fraser in 1870 based on Loewe additivity ( Fraser, 1872 ). This method has been widely accepted as one of the most practical models in terms of experimental design and eectiveness to illustrate t he synergistic/additive/antagonistic interactions. Simila r to the CI model, the isobole method requires the determination of dose- response relationship of the combination and its individual components independently to assess if synergism exists. This is expressed as a dose response curve on an isobole graph as shown in Figure2. The isobole is an \"iso-eect\" curve, in which a combination of components (A or B) at dierent dose levels is represented on the graph, the axes of which are the dose-axes of the individual constituent (A and B). The dashed line joining the points (i.e. ED 50of A and B) which represent the same dosage required from the combination as the sum of the individual component to reach the same eect. If the dots of the combination falls on this dashed line, it represen ts an additive eect, i.e., no interactions between components A and B. If synergy occurs the curve becomes \"concave.\" The opposite applies for antagonism representing by a \"convex\" isobole (Figure2). It is also possible to have synergy at one dose combination and antagonism at another, with the same substances and this would give a complicated isobole with a wave-likeorevenellipticalappearance. In theory, isobologram and Fa-CI plot are both based on the same CI equation and therefore should yield an identical conclusion. However, isobologram explains synergy from a Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org 3 July 2016 | Volume 7 | Article 201Zhou et al.

Time-kill assayPositive/negative interactions among multi-components in the mixture are determined via comparing individual and combinational bacteri cidal activity over a series of time intervals.1) One of the best methods to study synergy of antimicrobial agents. 2) The bacterial cidal effect is monitored over time which is not possible with the frequently used MIC assays.1) The method is labor intensive and requires a number of steps where variables may be introduced. 2) Difcult in interpretation of results because relatively few antibiotic concentrations are examined. 3) Rely on the reading at one time point (usually 24h) as the sole determinant of the interaction. dose-orientedperspective(reachingthesametherapeuticact ivity but with a lower dose level required), while Fa-CI plot from an eect-oriented perspective (resulting in a higher therapeut ic activity at the same dosage level). Additionally, Fa-CI plot can be used to determine multi-component interactions, whereas isobologram is only feasible for a two drug combination as it is notpossibletoconstructmultidimensionalisobologramcurv es. Both CI and isobologram models are designed for evaluating the synergistic/antagonistic interaction between two or m oresingle-entity agents acting on the same target/receptor. Even though these models have been recently used for analyzing possible synergistic interactions in simple herbal formula (herb-pair), they are by and large less adequate for evaluation of the complex interactions among multiple bioactive components of CHM formulations ( Gu and Chen, 2014 ) (for more detailed discussions see Section Current Status of Synergy Research in Chinese Herbal Medicine). Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org 4 July 2016 | Volume 7 | Article 201Zhou et al. Synergy in Chinese Herbal Medicine FIGURE 1 | An example of utilizing CI model to determine synergy fo r the combination of agent AB in certain xed ratio. (A) Dose-effect curves for A, B, and AB, respectively. (B)CI value-Fa (Fa: fraction affected level) curve for AB gener ated from CalcuSyn based on the dose-response curves shown i n(A). It demonstrated that synergistic effect is starting from 60% e ffective level (Fa =0.6) and this synergistic effect continues to increase (CI <1) at higher effect levels in AB. Systematic Analysis/System to System (S2S) The CI and isobologram methods both require combination- by-combination evaluations of individual components in a mixturespecicallyactingonthesametarget/receptor.Howe ver, for a complex combinational therapy especially TCM multi- herb formulations, which often contain hundreds of potentia lly bioactive components that may act on a network targets, it is technically impossible to use these two models to evaluate all combinations of bioactive components on each of the target on e byone. Asystematicanalysis(orS2S)approachintegratingliteratu re, experimentaldata,andcomputationalscienceshasbeenrecen tly developed to address the multi-target synergistic actions. To conduct this analysis, the three-dimensional structures o f individual compounds in the combination are obtained from relevant database, handbooks or literature, and the known crystal structures of all the key genes/proteins associated with targeted disease are retrieved from relevant data banks or databases. The network constructions between agents and targeted protein/genes are then constructed viaa molecular docking approach. Molecular docking is usually applied for computer-assisted drug design, which predicts the predominan t binding mode(s) of a ligand with a protein of known structure. Here, it is used to analyse binding modes between the potentia l activecompoundsandtheircorrespondingtargetproteinsbase d on their structure binding modes, in order to generate a drug - target network. The predicted interaction between bioactiv e and targeted receptors from the generated network can either be conrmedbyliteratureorvalidatedthroughexperimentalst udies (WangX.etal.,2012;Leungetal.,2013 ).Thismodelinvestigates the multi-target mechanisms of action of multi-constituen ts mixtures and identies the key active components, which can bind to most of the corresponding targets. In addition, this method can be used in drug development through selecting and combiningthemostactivecomponentsthatactonthemaximum amount of the protein or gene targets. This minimal eectivecomposition with denite constituents and controllable qual ity can optimize the composition of the mixture while maintaining theircurativeeects( Lietal.,2012;Liangetal.,2012 ). The S2S approach has gained popularity as a promising and valuabletooltoevaluatesynergyofcomplexherbalformulat ions (Lee, 2015 ). However, due to the poor understanding of the chemical and pharmacological properties of bioactive constituentsofmanyTCMherbs,theapplicationofthismethod instudyingsynergisticeectsofTCMherbstogaininsightof the holistic approach of CHM remains a challenge ( Wang X. et al., 2012). Models Used in Microbiology Studies In microbiology, several bioassays and mathematics models have been developed and applied to the investigations of the synergistic anti-bacterial eects of individual bioact ive components of Chinese herbs and antibiotic agents including diusionassay,checkerboardarray,andtime-killassay. Diffusion Assay This is a simple, visual and qualitative microbiology assay t hat can be used to investigate the combinational eect of individ ual components used together. Inhibition/kill studies in agar o r broth,microscopyandmolecularanalysisareusedtoinvestig ate the mode of action of antimicrobial agents. In this method, each individual test samples (A or B) and their combination (A+B) are placed in separate wells or disc on agar containing pathogenic organisms, and their inhibition zones are compare d. Iftheinhibitionzoneofthecombinationislargerthanthat from A or B, positive interactions are noted. Should the inhibitio n zone of the combination be smaller than A or B independently, then negative interactions are noted. Since it only compares the inhibition zone of combination with individual component, i t cannot dierentiate synergism from additive eect. Moreover, thismethodissubjecttomanyvariableswhichmayinfluencet he resultsandisusedasaqualitativeguideonly.

Dose A and Dose B are the individual concentrations of Compon ents A and B; Dose AB are the concentrations of A and B in the combination. The dashed line shows zero interaction between A and B, which represents a si mple additive effect. The effect of the combination equals the sum of the effects from individual co mponents. (A)Effect of synergy: the dot is underneath the dashed line. (B)Effect of antagonism: The dot is above the dashed line; Addition: The dot is on the dashed li ne. Checkerboard Array This method is used for evaluating synergistic interaction s of antimicrobial agents against bacteria or fungi. In this met hod, theeectsofinteractionsareassessedthroughtheserialdi lution of two agents A and B [two-fold dilution to four times of estimatedminimuminhibitoryconcentration(MIC); Hsiehetal., 1993). A checkerboard is constructed in a two dimension array with the same amount of series dilutions of agent A and agent B in x and y-axis. Thus, each tube/well in the middle of checkerboard contains a unique combination of agent A and B being tested. With the addition of cell viability dyes such as resazurin or MTT, the inhibitory activity of individu al, and the combination of components can be visually assessed and quantied by fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC ). In addition, the turbidity of the wells prior to and after incuba tion with the microbe can be assessed for their dierence, which ca n then also be used as an indicator of MIC. This method is easy to carry out and interpret the interactions between two agent s, andmulti-concentrationscanbetestedsimultaneously.Ho wever, factors such as compound/herb solubility in the wells, biol m formation, and interactions between the compounds/herbs wi th the indicator dyes, all of which can be problematic for the turbidometric and/or colorimetric readings, can result in the inaccurateassessmentofviabilityofthetestmicrobe. Time-Kill Assay This method provides descriptive information on the relationship between bactericidal activity and the concen tration ofatestsubstance.Theprincipleinvolvesexposingtheinhibi tor to a selected pathogen and, at selected time intervals, aliqu ots are sampled and serially diluted. The dilutions are plated out , incubated at optimum conditions for the test organism, and the colony for forming units (CFU) are counted and plotted logarithmicallyagainsttime.Dependingonthecurveofthed ose response, either an additive, synergistic, or antagonistic eects is determined. Since this method can monitor the bactericid al eect over dierent time-points, it is quite labor intensive an drequires a number of steps where variables may be introduced. It is dicult to interpret results because relatively few ant ibiotic concentrationsareexamined. CURRENT STATUS OF SYNERGY RESEARCH IN CHINESE HERBAL MEDICINE For the last decades, it is well-accepted that combined drug therapies may provide better clinical outcomes in the treatmen t ofsomeconditionssuchashypertension,cancer,depressiona nd HIVinfection.Syntheticpharmaceuticaldrugsareusuallysin gle chemical entities acting on a single biological target. Com bined drug therapies are formulated in a fashion to augment the total eects in treating the target condition, reduce the sid e eect via dose-sparing of the active components, or address dierent metabolic interdependence, mediators or risk facto rs of diseases through a variation of independent biomolecular targets. However, due to the limitation of the methodology currently available, it is still challenging to identify the best possible combinations from the large amount of the existing drugs, evaluate their molecular interactions, and establis h their ecacyandsafety( Orlo,2005 ). In contrast to western style combined drug therapies where chemical properties and pharmacological eects of individual compounds are well-dened, Chinese herbal formulations are constructed according to TCM theories (\"Peiwu\" and \"Jun- Chen-Zuo-Shi\"). Despite the long history of clinical use and a solid theoretical basis, the multi-component and multi-ta rget nature of CHM poses a huge challenge to the study of the mechanismsofaction,includingsynergisticeectsunderpinn ing the complex herbal formulations ( Wang et al., 2009 ).

Synergy in Chinese Herbal Medicine and understanding of synergistic eects of Chinese herbal formulation. In this study, we conducted a thorough literat ure search(keywordsused:\"Synergism\"or\"Synergy\"or\"Synerg istic\" and\"Chineseherbalmedicine\"or\"Chinesemedicinalherbs\" )in PubMed and Google scholar from the period of 1990 to 2015. The numbers of studies using proper synergy models are shown inFigure3.Keystudiesidentiedaresummarizedin Table2. Synergy Reflected in Chemical Fingerprint Chemical ngerprint studies high-performance liquid resolutionmethodshavebeenconductedtodetectchangesin the amount of pharmacologically active compounds in individual herbs when given in combination ( Han et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2011; Kaliappan et al., 2014 ). During the decocting preparation, the chemical composition is often altered due to solvent's polarity, heating eects or changed pH environment ( Li, 2014). These changes in chemical composition could account for the increased therapeutic eects and/or reduced side eects Chishao), which commonly used to promote blood circulation and remove stasis, were markedly altered when given together du e to the formation of non-volatile, water soluble salts durin g the decoction process ( Li et al., 2006 ). In addition, the amount of aconitine, a toxic component of Aconitum carmichaeli Debx. (Fuzi) is signicantly reduced due to its chemical reaction with tannineunderhightemperature. Chemical ngerprint studies have also shown that new compounds are formed when herbs are given in combination during the preparation. For instance, Wang Y. L. et al. (2012) identied four new compounds in a Radix Polygalae ( Yuanzhi) andAcorusTatarinowiiRhizoma( Shichangpu )combinationthat were not detected in the individual extracts ( Wang Y. L. et al., 2012). Although, the biological eects of these new compounds werenotevaluatedinthisstudy,itprovidespossibleexplanati ons for the changes in pharmacological properties when herbs are usedincombination. Synergistic Interactions within Single Herb Analyzed by CI or Isobologram Method Individual herbal extracts consist of a complex mixture of bioactive compounds, concomitant agents and other minor substances among which interactions can occur leading to synergistic eects. For example, Ginkgo biloba extract has been property ( Dutta Royetal.,1999 ),whichcouldcontributetoitstherapeuticeects for enhancing blood flow ( Zhang and Xue, 2012 ). Synergistic interaction between ginkgolides A and B, two bioactive components of Ginkgo biloba, been demonstrated in a platelet aggregation testusingtheisobolemethod( Williamson,2001 ). In a study conducted by Lin et al. (2007) , the anti-cancer property of four lines (human PCa22 Rv1, and LNCaP cells) ( Lin et al., 2007 ). Interestingly, as revealed by the CI analysis using CalcuSyn software, a signicantly stronger anti-cancer eect was observed when the four compounds were combined at the same ratio as in the original herb extract when compared with that of each individual compound highlighting the synergistic property of these compounds present in Wedlia chinensis . It is worth mentioningthattheanti-canceractivitywassignicantly reduced when any one of these bioactive compounds was removed from thecombination,indicatingthesignicanceofthefourbio active compoundsactingasawhole. Kan et al. (2008) demonstrated the anti-cancer activities of the three major phthalides mixture [butylidenephthalide (BL P), senkyunolide A (SKA), and z-ligustilide (LGT)] from Angelica sinensiswith the same ratio as they were in the extract on colon cancer HT-29 cell line. Although three phthalides mixt ure demonstrated synergistic cytoxic eects, it was shown that t he anti-proliferative eects of the whole A. sinensis extract was still signicantlyhigherthanofthecorrespondingphthalidemixt ure. Therefore,itsuggestedpositiveinteractionsofactivecom ponents and other co-existing components within the herb ( Kan et al., 2008). Synergistic Interactions within Multi-Herbal Combinations Synergistic Interactions in Herb-Pair Analyzed by CI or Isobologram Method Multiple herbs are commonly used in Chinese herbal formulations, and pose further methodological challenges in synergy research. Salvia miltiorrhiza (Danshen) andPueraria lobate(Gegen) are commonly used in combination for the treatment of coronary heart disease ( Sieveking et al., 2005; Koon et al., 2011; Ng et al., 2011 ). A study conducted by Cheung et al. (2012) demonstrated that the anti-atherogenic eects of Danshen-Gegen combination in a 7:3 additive anti-foam cell formation, and anti-vSMC proliferation,respectively.Thiswastherststudydemonstrat ing the feasibility of applying CI analysis in the synergy study of herbalcombinations( WingShingCheungetal.,2012 ). Several other studies have been conducted to investigate synergistic interactions of two-by-two combinations in co mplex formulations. For example, synergistic eects of ve commonly tested in an in vitro study (Yi and Wetzstein, 2011 ). In this study, individual extracts were paired at 1:1 ratio an d their anti-cancer activities were compared in SW-479 colon cancer cell line using CI model by CalcuSyn software.

The results indicates that Radix Curcumae share the most common targets with Fructus Gardeniae (15), while less common targets with Moschus and Borneolum (8 and 1, respectively). Further integrated network shows that Radix Curcumae represents the principal component for the prevention of CCVD, and other three medicines serve as adjuvant ones to assist the effects of the principal component, which together probably display synergistic actions.Tao et combination DGR [6,7-dimethylesculetin (D), geniposide (G), and rhein (R) ] from Yinchenhao decoction, exerts a more robust therapeutic effect than any one or two of the three individual compounds by hitting multiple targets in a rat model of hepatic injury.Wang et al., 2013 Invivo Yin-Chen-Hao-Tang (YCHT): Artemisiaannua L.

Identifying active Chemical Constituents Contributing to Synergistic Interactions In recent years, a new methodology that combining CI model and fractionation technique was developed for identifying a nd isolating synergistic interacted active constituents. Fo r example, in a study by Xu et al. (2014) , synergistic anti-oxidant activities ofAstragalus membranaceus (AME) and Paeonia Lactiflora (PL) combination were reported. In this study, AME and PL extracts residueswerecombinedanddierentfractionswereobtained byfurther sequential extraction with dierent solvents.

Synergy in Chinese Herbal Medicine FIGURE 3 | Histogram showing the general increase in synergy of Chinese herbal medicine related publications in the years 1999-2015 (up to June only for 2015) from a bibliographic search in PubMed and Google Scholar database carried out in June 2015. by HPLC-ESIMS/MS including calycosin, and formonoetin foetida (Wang et al., 2014 ). These studies have clearly demonstrated a relatively ecient method to isolate and identify active compounds from herbal combinati on, providing an exemplar for mechanistic study of synergistic eects of CHMs. However, it is worth pointing out that the fractionation method employed in these two studies discarde d the \"inactive\" fractions and therefore, their possible inter actions with the active compounds were not tested/considered. Indee d, it has been demonstrated that the antioxidant eects of the active components isolated from Salvia plebeian R. Br. were much weaker than that of the crude extracts, indicating that the components \"inactive\" may play a role in the pharmacological eects of the herbal combinations (GuandWeng,2001 ). Systematically Determine Synergistic Interactions within Multi-Herb Formulations system (S2S)\" or \"systematic analysis\" methods integrating chemomic and systems biology have recently been employed in the study of synergistic eects of complex herbal formulations. This method analyses the multi-target actio ns of mixed chemical constituents with a system of targeted protein/receptors [see Section Systematic Analysis/System to System (S2S)], thus it is more suitable for the complex nature of TCM formula. For example, Liu Wei Di Huang Wan is a classic TCM formula used to manage various complex diseases such as hypertension and esophagus carcinoma. It consists of 6 herbal ingredients including Shu Di Huang (Rehmanniae Radix Praeparata), Shan Zhu Yu (Corni Cortex), Shan FuLing (Poria), and Ze Xie (Alismatis Rhizoma), each of them were found to have multiple pharmacological eects. Liang et al. (2014) attempted to evaluate the mechanisms underlying the interactions of hundreds of chemical constituents in the formula on their potential biological targets by utilizing a novel network pharmacology approach. It was found that the key synergistic interactions occur on multiple systems includin g maintaining homeostasis in endocrine system, immune syste m andmetabolism.However,thesignicanceofthisstudyisli mited due to the fact that not all potentially bioactive ingredients from the formula were identied and that their pharmacologic al properties were thoroughly dened. Nevertheless, the result s havedemonstratedtheholisticmodeofactionofaherbformu la targeting on a network based multi-systems, and highlighted the diculties associated with synergistic research in CHM (Liangetal.,2014 ). Li et al. (2012) attempted to illustrate the synergistic mechanisms underpinning the \"Jun-Chen-Zuo-Shi\" theory of CHM in a study of Danshen formula (CDF) using a systems- pharmacological network model. CDF Danshen Borneolum ) as the courier (\"Shi\") herb. In this study major bioactive compounds that have high oral bioavailability from each herb were screened and selec ted through a robust in silicomodel OBioavail 1.1. Based on the available pharmacological data of these candidate compounds , their potential targets were searched through \"PharmMapper Server,\" and those targets that were related to the pathologi cal processes of CVD were selected. Thus, the compound-target network was constructed, and the interactions/relationshi p of the compounds from each herb work on the same or dierent Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org 11 July 2016 | Volume 7 | Article 201Zhou et al. Synergy in Chinese Herbal Medicine targets for CVD was investigated. The results demonstrated that candidate compounds from Danshen tackled 39 out of total 41 validated CVD targets (except eNOS and ACE2), whereas that fromSanqiinteracted with 36 potential targets, 34 of which overlapped with Danshen's targets. Furthermore, the network analysis showed that the compounds from Danshen targeted the whole CVD systems, whereas that of Sanqiplaced emphasis on the modulation of vascular smooth muscle cells providing evidence to support the former as the \"Jun\"/key herb and the latter as the \"Chen\"/adjuvant herb in the formula ( Li et al., 2012 ). In a similar study, the underlying cardio- and cerebrovascular protective mechanism of a (Yujin),FructusGardeniae (Zhizi), Moschus (Shexiang), andBorneolum network reconstruction method through matching bioacti ve components with good oral bioavailability with their potenti al targets on cardio- and cerebrovascular system. The data sho wed that 58 bioactive compounds identied from the herbs in the formulawereshowntointeractwith32potentialtargetsrela ting to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases (CCVD). It was suggested that Radix Curcumae was the keyherb inthis formula as it contained the most candidate compounds that possessed high degree distribution on CCVD related targets (8 targets ) followed by Fructus Gardeniae as the minister herb (5 targets), Moschus (2 targets) as the adjuvant herb and Borneolum (0 targets)asthemessengerherb( Taoetal.,2013 ). In addition, systems biology can also be used to screen the active components from the complex formula that act on the major therapeutic targets. Shuanglong formula (SLF), consi sting ofPanax ginseng andS. miltiorrhiza , is a popular Chinese herbal formulation for the treatment of myocardial infarct ion (MI) (Liang et al., 2012 ).Liang et al. (2012) employed a S2S method using cell lines, isolated tissue and animal models to optimize the phytochemical composition of SLF and revealed that the cardiac protective eect of SLF is primarily through synergistic interactions between ginsenosides and salvia acids fromPanax ginseng andS. miltiorrhiza, respectively ( Liang et al., 2012 ). Based on these results a new formulation, NFSL6 consistingtotalginsenosidesandtotalsalvianolicacids atratioof 7:3 was successfully developed using pharmacological screen ing. Similarly, Wang et al. (2013) applied systematic analysis in the study of Yinchenhao decoction L.), classical formula used for treating hepatic injury syndrome . Three major active components including 6,7-dimethylescul etin (D), geniposide (G) and rhein (R) were found to be the main contributors to the ecacy of the formula and the D- G-R combination synergistically reduced histologic chang es and metabolic biomarkers,andmodied15targetproteinexpressionsinther at hepaticinjurymodel( Wangetal.,2013 These studies the \"system to system\" or \"systems-pharmacological network\" models are applicable to the study of synergistic eects in complex herbal formulation s. The results appear to support the rationality of \"Jun-Chen- Zuo-Shi\" theory of complex Chinese herbal formulations and promoted the understanding of the multi-componentsinteractions in these formulations. In addition, by explori ng the active fractions/components from a formula, it facilitates the development of new formulations and/or new drug candidates. However, these methods reply heavily on the availability of the chemical and pharmacological data concerning the active components in some well-studied herbs/herbal formulas and therefore are not applicableto many herbs or herbal formulas i n which their active components unknown and molecular targets unclear. Synergistic Interactions between Chinese Herbal Medicine and Pharmaceutical Drugs Due to the rapid expansion of the concurrent use of pharmaceutical medicines and Chinse herbal medicine, resea rch intotheirinteractionsandtheunderlyingmechanismsisur gently needed. Some of these interactions may be therapeutically benecial via synergism to enhance therapeutic eects or via antagonism to reduce side eects. Most of the synergistic studies available relate to anti-cancer therapies. For exam ple, anti-cancer properties of Polyphyllin I (PPI-active component from Adams et al., 2007; Chan et al., 2009; Kong et al., 2010 ), but their ecacy is generally weaker than that of chemotherapeutic agents such as platinum (Pt), 5-Fluorouraci l (5-Fu), and irinotecan (CPT-11). However, when PPI or EVO were combined with Pt or 5-Fu, it produced a signicantly stronger inhibition rate than Pt or 5-Fu alone on freshly- removedgastriccancertissuesfrompatients.TheCIvalueswe re found to be <1 in all combinations at fraction aected (Fa) =80%, indicating a synergistic anti-cancer eect ( Yue et al., 2013). Lin et al. (2014) demonstrated that the combination of aqueousextractoftheleavesandfruitof Camptothecaacuminate (AE-CA) and cisplatin (platinum analogs) exerted synergistic cytotoxicityeectsinHEC-1AandHEC-1Bhumanendometrial carcinoma cells. This study also demonstrated that the cytoto xic eect of the mixed AE-CA extracts was signicantly stronger than that of camptothecin (CPT), a chemotherapeutic drug isolated from C. acuminate . However, the AE-CA extracts produced similar eects on cell-cycle regulation and the accumulation of cyclin-A2 and Therefore, were investigated using estr ogen receptor-responsive and non-responsive breast cancer cells (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines). SCS extracts alone induced around 50% cell death after 24 h treatment. When combined with low doses of tamoxifen (which did exert any signicant cytotoxic eect on its own), SCS extracts produced 80% cell death after 24 h treatment, which was proved to be a synergistic eect based on the method of CI using Calcusyn software( Yaacobetal.,2014 ). Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org 12 July 2016 | Volume 7 | Article 201Zhou et al. Synergy in Chinese Herbal Medicine A study by Seo et al. (2014) has shown that a mixture of curcumin, a main bioactive component of Curcuma longa and NVP-BEZ 235 (a potent inhibitor of PI3K and mTOR) can synergistically induce apoptosis in human renal carcinom a caki cells ( Seo et al., 2014 ). The mixture of 2 \u00b5M NVP-BEZ235 and 30 \u00b5M curcumin signicantly provoked cell shrinkage, membrane blebbing, chromatin damage in the nuclei and DNA fragmentation; none of these eects were as signicant when curcumin and NVP-BEZ235 were used alone. Isobologram analyses demonstrated that there were synergistic activit ies betweencurcuminandNVP-BEZ235. Synergistic Interactions between Chinese Herbal Medicine and Antibiotics in Microbiology Studies Synergistic eects between antibiotics and herbal medicine have also been extensively studied. Agar diusion assay is often used for screening the anti-bacterial activity of individu al agent, and used as qualitative guide for positive/negative interac tion guide for agents' mixture. For (pseudolaric gentiopicrin, rhein and alion) extracte d from CHMs (herbal source was not stated in the paper) were tested on agar diusion assay, and only pseudolaric acid B showed signicant fungicidal activity with growth inhibit ion zones ranging from 8 to 25mm against C. albicans ,C. Furthermore, a positive interaction was observed between pseudolaric acid B and fluconazole in the agar diusion assay on the same disc, where there was no microcolony growth in the cross-sectional area of pseudolaric acid B and fluconazol e observed ( Jiang et al., 2010 ). In addition, checkerboard array and time-kill assay are commonly used methods to quantitive ly determinethesynergism/addition/antagonisminteractio ns.Jang et al. (2014) explored the synergistic antibacterial activities of baicalein, a flavonoid originally isolated from root of S. baicalensis Georgi, with ampicillin and/or gentamicin against a range of oral bacteria strains. Their results showed that bo th baicalein-ampicillin and baicalein-gentamicin combinati ons demonstrated synergistic by checkerboard array ( Jang et al., 2014). In addition, time-kill array results conrmed the positive interaction between baicalen-ampicillin and baical en- gentamicin, respectively, which showed substantially stron ger bactericidal eect in combination compared with individual eect from 0 to 24 h ( Jang et al., 2014 ). Similarly, Hwang et al. (2013)alsoutilizedchecker-boardarraytoanalysethesynergisti c eect between class of flavonoids, antibiotics such cefotaxime Their result s showedthatamentoflavonehadaconsiderableantibacterial eect and exerted synergistic interactions with antibiotics aga inst all bacterial strains tested (FICI 0.5) except for Streptococcus mutans. This synergistic eect was suggested to be largely mediated by the formation of hydroxyl radical by nicotinami de adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADH) depletion ( Hwang etal.,2013 ).CONCLUSION In this review, we have claried the denition of synergy from two angles pharmacodynamics (enhanced therapeutic actions on the same target) and pharmacokinetics (no direct interaction but with multi-target behavior), as well as eluc idated the common misconceptions of synergy. It is critical to distinguish between synergistic eects and simple additive eects of individual herbs or active ingredients in a complex herbal formulation. Several rigorous analytical methods s uch as isobolographic analysis, combination index (CI), and systems biology have been developed for the quantitative evaluations of synergistic eects. These methods have great ly facilitated the development and standardization of combinat ion therapies (e.g., chemotherapy treatment) in conventional western medicine. However unlike western medicine where the chemical and pharmacological properties of individual drugs are clearly dened, herbal medicine often contains numerous active ingredients, which can all contribute to th eir synergy eects. This poses a huge challenge in the study of synergistic eects of herbal medicine and a dierent research approach is needed to accurately evaluate and quantify these eects. We have also summarized current available methods for the study of synergistic eects of CHM. These methods have been successfully used to determine the nature (i.e., synerg istic, additive, or antagonistic) of the interactions within sing le herbs, multiple herbal formulations or between pharmaceutical drug s and herbal medicine. Each of these methods has strengths and weaknesses and therefore careful consideration should b e given when designing a synergistic study of herbal medicine. For example, the CI and isobologram models are relatively fast and simple and are ideal for studying the interactions of a small number of active components or herbal extracts in which their chemical and pharmacological properties are well-dened. However, the CI or isobologram methods are designed for mono-target therapies, and it is of limited use in demonstrating synergistic eects in complex combined therapies especially those in CHM. S2S mode/systems biology methods approach the issues from a systematic perspective, which is consistent with the holistic approach of Chinese medicine. This network system may be more suited for the study of synergistic mechanisms underlying complex herbal formulations. However, these methods rely on the availabil ity of large amount of chemical and pharmacological data, which are absent at the moment for most of the herbs and herbal formulations. More research into the chemical and molecular/pharmacological bases of herbal medicine and the ir bioactive components is needed before these analyses can be appliedmorebroadly. In summary, synergy research on CHM is still at its infancy.Thecurrentlyavailablemethodshavevarioussign icant limitationsonthesynergystudiesofCHM;moremethodologica l developmentisurgentlyneededinthefuture.Despitesynergist ic eects demonstrated in numerous pharmacological studies, these ndings do not always represent the clinical therapeutic superiority.
