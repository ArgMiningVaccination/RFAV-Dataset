About 1/3 of the nation's physicians are generalists, or \"primary care\" doctors, although that percentage is declining as more physicians choose to become specialists. Generalists include fields such as internists, family physicians, and pediatricians. Specialists focus on a particular disease, system, or body part; examples include neurologists, oncologists, and cardiologists, to name a few.
