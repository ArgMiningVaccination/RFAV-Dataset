My name is Molly Howell and I am the Immunization Director of for the North Dakota Department of Health. I do not have testimony for HB1306 but want to let you know I am available virtually to answer questions, if needed. Additionally, attached is a list of studies that have been previously published regarding vaccine s, autism and SIDS. Thank You.

Measles, Mumps, Rubella Vaccination and Autism: A Nationwide Cohort Study PDF available here Annals of Internal Medicine March 2019 The study strongly supports that MMR vaccination does not increase the risk for autism, does not trigger autism in susceptible children, and is not associated with clustering of autism cases after vaccination. It adds to previous studies through significant additional statistical power and by addressing hypotheses of susceptible subgroups and clustering of c ases. 2. Autism Occurrence by MMR Vaccine Status Among US Children With Older Siblings With and Without Autism http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2275444 The Journal o f the American Medical Association April 2015 In this large sample of privately insured children with older siblings, receipt of the MMR vaccine was not associated with increased risk of ASD, regardless of whether older siblings had ASD. These findings ind icate no harmful association between MMR vaccine receipt and ASD even among children already at higher risk for ASD. 3. Safety of Vaccines Used for Routine Immunization of U.S. Children: A Systematic Review http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25086160 Pediatrics August 2014 We found evidence that some vaccines are associated with serious AEs; however, these events are extremely rare and must be weighed against the protective benefits that vaccines provide. 4. Vaccines are Not Associated with Autism: An Evidence -Based Meta -Analysis of Case -Control and Cohort Studies 2 01/18/2021 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24814559 Vaccine June 2014 Findings of this meta-analysis suggest that vaccinations are not associated with the development of autism or autism spectrum disorder. Furthermore, the components of the vaccines (thimerosal or mercury) or multiple vaccines (MMR) are not associated with the development of autism or autism spectrum disorder. 5. On-time Vaccine Receipt in the First Year Does Not Adversely Affect Neuropsychological Outcomes http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/125/6/1134 Pediatrics Smith, M and Woods, C June 2010 Timely vaccination during infancy has no adverse effect on neuropsychological outcomes 7 to 10 years later. These data may reassure parents who are concerned that children receive too many vaccines too soon. 6. Vaccines and Autism: A Tale of Shifting Hypotheses http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/596476 Clinical Infectious Diseases Offit, Paul and Gerber, Jeffrey S. February 2009 Twenty epidemiologic studies have shown that neither thimerosal nor MMR vaccine causes autism. These studies have been perfor med in several countries by many different investigators who have employed a multitude of epidemiologic and statistical methods. The large size of the studied populations has afforded a level of statistical power sufficient to detect even rare associations . These studies, in concert with the biological implausibility that vaccines overwhelm a child's immune system, have effectively dismissed the notion that vaccines cause autism. Further studies on the cause or causes of autism should focus on more -promisin g leads. 7.

Addressing Parents' Concerns: Do Multiple Vaccines Overwhelm or Weaken the Infant's Immune System? http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/109/1/124 Pediatrics Offit, Paul A., Quar les, Jessica, et al. 2002 Current studies do not support the hypothesis that multiple vaccines overwhelm, weaken, or \"use up\" the immune system. On the contrary, young infants have an enormous capacity to respond to multiple vaccines, as well as to the man y other challenges present in the environment. By providing protection against a number of bacterial and viral pathogens, vaccines prevent the \"weakening\" of the immune system and consequent secondary bacterial infections occasionally caused by natural inf ection. 10.

Pediatrics B, D'Elia L, Chariotti F, Salmaso S. January 2009 Given the large number of statistical comparisons performed, the few associations found between thimerosal exposure and neuropsychological development might be attributable to chance. The associations found, although statistically significant, were based on small differences in mean test scores, and their clinical relevance remains to be determined. 15.

Grether, PhD January 2008 The DDS data do not show any recent decrease in autism in California despite the exclusion of more than trace levels of thimerosal from nearly all childhood vaccines. The DDS data do not support the hypothesis that exposure to thimerosal during childhood is a primary cause of autism. 16.

Burbacher, PhD April 2005 The results indicate that MeHg is not a suitable reference for risk assessment from exposure to thimerosal -derived Hg. Knowledge of the toxicoki netics and developmental toxicity of thimerosal is needed to afford a meaningful assessment of the developmental effects of thimerosal -containing vaccines. 19.

Conflicting results were found at different HMOs for certain outcomes. For resolving the conflicting findings, studies with uniform neurodevelopmental assessments of children with a range of cumulative thimerosal exposures are needed. 22.

September 2008 This study provides strong evidence against association of autism with persistent MV RNA in the GI tract or MMR exposure. Autism with GI disturbances is associated with elevated rates of regression in language or other skills and may represent an endophenotype distinct from other ASD. 30. Measles Vaccination and Antibody Response in Autism Spectrum D isorders https://adc.bmj.com/content/93/10/832.abstract? Archives of Disease in Childhood Gillian Baird, F.R.C.Paed.

Pervasive Developmental Disorders in Montreal, Quebec, Canada: Prevalence and Links With Immunizations http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&cmd=Retrieve&dop t=AbstractPlus&list_uids=16818529&query_hl=2&itool=pubmed_docsum Pediatrics Eric Fombonne, MD July 2006 The prevalence of pervasive developmental disorder in Montreal was high, increa sing in recent birth cohorts as found in most countries. Factors accounting for the increase include a broadening of diagnostic concepts and criteria, increased awareness and, therefore, better identification of children with pervasive developmental disorders in communities and epidemiologic surveys, and improved access to services. The findings ruled out an association between pervasive developmental disorder and either high levels of ethylmercury exposure comparable with those experienced in the United St ates in the 1990s or 1- or 2-dose measles -mumps -rubella vaccinations. 32. MMR t=Abstract&list_uids=15364187&query_hl=38 9 01/18/2021 The Lancet Liam Smeeth, MRCGP September 11, 2004 Our findings suggest that MMR vaccination is not associated with an incre ased risk of pervasive developmental disorders. 33.

Given the real risks of not vaccinating and that the risks and existence of variant ASD remain theoretical, current policies should continue to advocate the use of the MMR vaccine. 34. Neurologic Disorders t=Abstract&list_uids=12415036&query_hl=64 Pediatrics Annamari Makela, MD November 2002 We did not identify any association between MMR vaccination and ence phalitis, aseptic meningitis, or autism. 35. No Evidence for of Measles -Mumps FRCPsych October 2001 No evidence was found to support a distinct syndrome of MMR -induced autism or of \"autistic enterocolitis.\" T hese results add to the recent accumulation of large -scale epidemiologic studies that all failed to support an association between MMR and autism at population level. When combined, the current 10 01/18/2021 findings do not argue for changes in current immunization prog rams and recommendations. 36. Vaccines for Measles, Mumps, rubella and varicella in children Vaccines for and varicella in children - Di Pietr antonj, C - 2020 | Cochrane Library Cochrane Review Di Pietrantonj, C, et al. April 2020 This study assessed currently available literature and analyzed the evidence regarding how effective MMR, MMR+V and MMRV vaccines are and if they cause unwanted effects. They found 138 studies with more than 23 million children to analyze. Overall, the st udies found that MMR, MMRV, and MMR+V vaccine did not cause autism (2 studies 1,194,764 children). Our review shows that MMR, MMRV and MMR+V vaccines are effective in preventing the infection of children by measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox, with no e vidence of an increased risk of autism or encephalitis and a small risk of febrile seizure. Vaccines and SIDS 1. Yang YT and Shaw J. Sudden infant death syndrome, attention - deficit/hyperactivity disorder and vaccines: longitudinal population analyses . Vaccine 2018;36:595-598. The authors analyz ed six years of vaccine uptake data for 3-month-olds from the National Immunization Survey and state -level National Vital Statistics SIDS reports and found vaccination coverage for routinely used childhood vaccines was not associated with an increased risk of SIDS. 2. Moro PL, Arana J, Cano M, Lewis P, Shimabukuro TT. Deaths reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, United States, 1997-2013 . CID 2015;61:980- 987. The authors examined deaths reported to VAERS in the United States during a 16-year period, with nearly half of the deaths attributed to SIDS. As with the previous 2001 study, SIDS reports progressively decreased over time, during which the addition of seven -valent pneumococcal vaccine and rotavirus vaccine were added to the recommended vaccine schedule, and the DTaP -HepB-IPV combination vaccine was licensed for use. 11 01/18/2021 3.

PLoS ONE 2011;6(1):e16363. The authors found no increased risk f or sudden unexplained death (SUD) and any vaccination in the time windows of 0 -7 days or 0-14 days after vaccine receipt. 4. Vennemann, MMT, Butterfab -Bahloul T, Jorch G, et al. Sudden infant death syndrome: no increased risk after immunisation . Vaccine 2007;25: 336-340. The authors investigated the risk of SIDS with immunization in the first year of life, particularly with a hexavalent vaccine containing 15 differe nt antigens. They found no increased risk of SIDS in the 14 days after immunization. As with previous studies, patients with SIDS were vaccinated less frequently and later than those infants without SIDS. 5.

Lack of association between hepatitis B birth immunization and neonatal death: A population -based study from the Vaccine Safety Datalink Project . Pediatr Infect Dis J 2004;23:656- 661. The authors evaluated more than 360,000 births during a five -year period to determine if a correlation existed between hepatitis B vaccine receipt at birth and neonatal death. The authors found no relationship between hepatitis B vaccine receipt at birth and neonatal death, and the proportion of deaths from unexpected causes (e.g., SIDS) was not different between vaccinated and unvaccinated infants. 6. Fleming PJ, Blair PS, Platt MW, Tripp J, Smith IJ, et al. The UK accelerated immunisation programme and sudden unexpected death in infancy: case -control study . BMJ 2001;322:1- 5. In the early 1990s, the schedule for routine infant immunizations in the United Kingdom was accelerated to give the vaccines at an earlier age. The authors found that the accelerated immunization program did not increase the risk of SIDS in a study population of 17.7 million infants. Immunization uptake was lowest among the infants who died from SIDS. 7. Jonville -Bera AP, Autret-Leca E, Barbeillon, Paris -Llado J and the French Reference Centers for SIDS.

The authors conducted a two-year prospective study on the vaccination status of infants with SIDS who died between 1 and 3 months of age to assess whether 12 01/18/2021 vaccination in creased the risk of SIDS in this population in France. The authors found DTPP \u00b1 Hib immunization did not increase the risk of SIDS. 8. Silvers LE, Ellenberg SS, Wise RP, Varricchio FE, Mootrey GT, et al. The epidemiology of fatalities reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System 1990-1997 . Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf 2001; 279-285. The authors examined fatalities reported to VAERS in the United States during a seven -year period and found that reports peaked in 1992-1993 and then declined, with nearly half of the deaths attributed to SIDS. The trend in decreasing SIDS rates correlated with the 1992 American Academy of Pediatrics recommendation for infants to slee p on their side or back and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development \"Back to Sleep\" campaign in 1994. The authors concluded that these data support findings of past controlled studies showing that the temporal association between infan t vaccination and SIDS is coincidental and not causal. 9. Griffin MR, Ray WA, Livengood JR, Schaffner W . Risk of sudden infant death syndrome after immunization with the dip htheria -tetanus -pertussis vaccine . New Engl J Med 1988;319(10):618-623. The authors evaluated recent immunization with DTP as a possible risk factor for SIDS during a 10-year period in Tennessee. They found no increase in the risk of SIDS after immunizatio n with DTP vaccine and no correlation between SIDS and age at first immunization. Additionally, the rate of SIDS decreased in the first week after immunization. 10. Hoffman HJ, Hunter JC, Damus K, Pakter J, Peterson DR, et al. Diphtheria -tetanus - pertussis immunization and sudden infant death: results of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Cooperative Epidemiological Study of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome R isk Factors . Pediatrics 1987;79:598-611. The authors investigated the possible association between diphtheria-tetanus - pertussis (DTP) immunization and subsequent occurrence of sudden infant death in the United States using data from a national SIDS epidemi ological database. They found no temporal association between SIDS and DTP vaccine receipt. Infants with SIDS were less likely to have been immunized than infants without SIDS. 11.
