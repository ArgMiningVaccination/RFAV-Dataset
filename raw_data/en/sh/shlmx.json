Ombudsman Ethical Principles Independence The Ombudsman is independent in structure, function and appearance to the highest degree possible within the organization. Neutrality and impartiality The Ombudsman, as a designated neutral resource, remains unaligned and impartial. The Ombudsman strives to promote procedural fairness in the content and administration of practices, processes and policies. The Ombudsman does not engage in any situation which could create a conflict of interest. Confidentiality The Ombudsman holds all communications with those seeking assistance in strict confidence and does not disclose confidential communications unless given permission to do so. The only exception to this privilege of confidentiality is where there appears to be imminent risk of serious harm. Informality The Ombudsman, as an informal resource, does not participate in any formal adjudicative or administrative procedure related to concerns brought to his/her attention. The Ombudsman's Office is a voluntary program and no one is required to use Ombudsman services. If a student chooses to meet with the Ombudsman, the student will be understood to have agreed to abide by these ethical principles, including agreeing not to call the Ombudsman to testify with respect to confidential communications.
