FRANCIS HOSPITAL C ERTIFICATE OF NEED APPLICATION TO PERMANENTLY ADD 10 ACUTE CARE BEDS MADE OPERATIONAL UNDER PROCLAMATION 20 -36 October 2022 INTRODUCTION Franciscan Health System, doing business as CHI Franciscan Health, a Washington not- for- profit corporation (\"FHS\") , owns and operates St. Francis Hospital, located in Federal Way. St. Francis Hospital is currently a 124 -bed hospital of which 118 of the beds are acute care (96 med/surg beds and 22 OB beds) beds and six are Level II nursery basinets. In March 2022, St. Francis submitted a certificate of need (CN) application to add 24 acute care beds. This application, assigned CN# 22- 40, is pending, and a decision is expected by November 17, 2022. As allowed u nder the Governor's Proclamation 20 -36, St. Francis Hospital has been operating 10 beds in excess of its current licensed 124 beds since early 2020. These 10 beds are separate and distinct from the 24- bed addition unde r current CN review . In order to retain these beds, and consistent with the Department's August 9, 2022, COVID -19 Waiver Offboarding guidance/process powerpoint, application. Assuming both CN applic ations are approved, St. Francis will ultimately have 34 additional beds, and will be licensed for 158 beds. There is no capital expenditure for the 10 beds associated with this project since the rooms are currently operational. There is also no additional staffing required for the 10 beds. The 10 beds are currently located in an observation unit that was designed to meet all applicable inpatient codes. FHS timely submitted our change of approved use application to Construction Review Services in August consis tent with the COVID Glidepath requirements ( CRS# 61374848). Please note that this CN application assumes the exact same admissions and patient day projections as included in the current 24 bed CN request. The purpose of this CN application is not to capture additional volume, rather it is to provide additional relief in the day -to-day operations of the Hospital. The 10 beds achieve this by slightly reduc ing midnight occupancy levels: with the 24 additional beds, midnight occupancy on medical/surgical beds was expected to be 73% in 2026 , with the 10 additional beds, it is expected to be 68% . This relief helps optimize current staffing and processes; and provides flexibility during sur ge periods. 1 SECTION 1 Applicant Description 1.

Provide a detailed description of the proposed project. If it is a phased project, describe each phase separately. For existing facilities, this should include a discussion of existing services and how these would or would not change as a result of the project. As noted in the introduction, this CN application requests approval to permanently add the ten (10) beds made operational in early 2020 under the Public Health Emergency Procla mation 20 -36. As noted in the letter of intent in Exhibit 2, these beds are consistently occupied with 8 -10 patients on average. There is no capital expenditure to add these beds and there is no incremental staffing required. 2. If your project involves the addition or expansion of a tertiary service, confirm you included the applicable addendum for that service. Tertiary services are outlined under WAC 246 -310- 020(1)(d)(i). This project does not propose the expansion of a tertiary service. 3. Provide a breakdown of the beds, by type, before and after the project. If the project will be phased, include columns detailing each phase. Table 2 details St. Francis' current and proposed bed configuration. Table 2 St. Francis Hospital Current and Proposed Bed Configuration Current (Licensed Beds) Proposed Bed Addition (CN Application #22 -40) Proposed Beds with Approval of 10 Beds Operated Under PHE #20 -36 and CN#22 -40 General Acute Care 118 142 152 PPS Exempt Psych 0 0 0 PPS Exempt Rehab 0 0 0 NICU Level II 6 6 6 NICU Level III 0 0 0 NICU Level IV 0 0 0 Specialized Pediatric 0 0 0 Skilled Nursing 0 0 0 Swing Beds 0 0 0 Total 124 148 158 Source: Applicant 64. Indicate if any of the beds listed above are not currently set -up, as well as the reason the beds are not set up. All of the 118 licensed acute care beds listed in Table 2 are currently set- up as are the 10 beds requested in this application. However, and due to patient care needs (unable to cohort because of isolation, behavior, hospice, privacy or family issues) the number of available beds can and does vary slightly. 5. With the understanding that the review of a Certificate of Need application typically takes six to nine months, provide an estimated timeline for project implementation, below. For phased projects, adjust the table to include each phase. Table 3 provides the anticipated timeline for this project. Table 3 St. Francis Hospital Proposed Timeline for 10 -Bed Addition Event Anticipated Month/Year Anticipated CN Approval June 2023 Design Complete NA Construction Commenced NA Construction Completed NA Facility Prepared for Survey June 2023 Facility Licensed - Project Complete WAC 246 -310 -010(47) July 2023 Source: Applicant 6. Provide a general description of the types of patients to be served as a result of this project. The new beds will be general med/surg beds and provide care primarily to adults. The most common conditions treated at St. Francis include general medical, pulmonary conditions, septicemia, OB, orthopedics, medical cardiology, interventional cardiology (including emergency and elective PCI), general surgery, neurology, gastroenterology, and oncology. 7. Provide a copy of the letter of intent that was already submitted according to WAC 246- 310- 080. A copy of the letter of intent and transition plan submitted consistent with the Governor's COVID Glide Path is included in Exhibit 2 . 7 8. Provide single- line drawings (approximately to scale) of the facility, both before and after project completion. For additions or changes to existing hospitals, only provide drawings of those floor(s) affected by this project. The requested drawings for the areas affected by the project are included in Exhibit 3 . 9. Provide the gross square footage of the hospital, with and without the project. The project does not include any new space, just a reconfiguration of existing. The gross square footage of St. Francis with and without the project is 241,340 square feet. 10. If this project involves construction of 12,000 square feet or more, or construction associated with parking for 40 or more vehicles, submit a copy of either an Environmental Impact Statement or a Declaration of Non - Significance from the appropriate governmental authority. [WAC 246 -03- 030(4)] This project does not involve any construction; therefore, this question is not applicable. 11. If your project includes construction, indicate if you've consulted with Construction Review Services (CRS) and provide your CRS project number. While this project does not involve construction, we have submitted a change in use application to CRS (CRS# 61374848). 8Section 4 Need (WAC 246 -310- 210) 1. List all other acute care hospitals currently licensed under RCW 70.41 and operating in the hospital planning area affected by this project. If a new hospital is approved, but is not yet licensed, identify the facility. St. Francis is located in the Southeast King Hospital Planning Area (Southeast King). Southeast King is a large geography spanning from the Puget Sound to the west, the King/Pierce County line to the South, the Cascade foothills to the East and south Bellevue and the eastern shore of Lake Washington in the north. There are four other hospitals located in this Planning Area. Each is listed in Table 4. Table 4 also includes the number of licensed and available/set up beds. Per the DOH Bed Survey, it should be noted that available/set- up beds in the planning area decreased between 2019 and 2020. Table 4 Southeast King Hospital Planning Area Hospitals, Licensed and Set Up Bed Capacity, 2019 and 2020 Hospital Acute Care Licensed Beds Acute Care Available/ Set Up Beds (2019) Acute Care Available/ Set Up Beds (2020) Acute Care Available/ Set Up Beds (202 1) Total Licensed Beds Total Available/ Set Up Beds (2019) Total Available/ Set Up Beds (2020) Total Available/ Set Up Beds (2021) MultiCare Auburn Medical Center 131 108 108 108 195 172 172 172 MultiCare Covington Hospital 58 58 43 43 58 58 43 43 Virginia Mason Franciscan - St. Elizabeth Hospital1 25 25 25 25 25 25 25 25 Virginia Mason Franciscan - St. Francis Hospital 118 118 118 118 124 124 124 124 UW Medicine - Valley Medical Center 321 311 308 308 341 328 328 328 Total 653 620 602 602 743 707 692 692 Source: DOH Bed Survey 2020 (for 2019) and 2021 (for 2020). Total licensed beds include psych, rehab and neonatal in addition to acute care. 1 Virginia -Mason Franciscan - St. Elizabeth hospital is licensed for 38 beds; however, as a critical access hospital, bed capacity is limited to 25 beds and therefore only 25 beds are counted in the bed need methodology. 92. For projects proposing to add acute care beds, provide a numeric need methodology that demonstrates need in thi s planning area. The numeric need methodology steps can be found in the Washington State Health Plan (sunset in 1989). In preparing the current 24 bed CN application, St. Francis consulted with the Certificate of Need Program (the Program), and it was agreed that despite the availability of full year 2020 CHARS data, and most likely full year 2021 CHARS data by the time that application move d into ex -parte, 2019 was reasonable to use as the baseline due to COVID's anticipated short- term impact on hospital inpatient days. As such, our projections for that application rely on 2019 as the baseline, and we continue to use 2019 in this application. There are a total of 653 acute care licensed beds and 620 set- up beds in the Planning Area. The numeric bed need methodology is included in Exhibit 4 . Step 10 of the methodology based on set- up beds identifies a need of 9 beds in 2023 growing to a need of 29 beds when the project opens and 72 beds by the 3 rd year of the project's operation. While bed need was calculated based on set- up beds, when licensed beds are used there is a need for beds by 2026 or within 3 years of the project being made operational. While we used 2019 data, we did review 2020 CHARS data. It shows only a 0.6% decrease in Southeast King resident days between 2019 and 2020, and a bed need methodology using 2020 as the baseline year continues to support a need for additional beds in the planning area. For reference, the 2020 bed need methodology is also presented in Exhibit 4 . It should be noted, during the public comment on the 24 bed CN application, MultiCare reiterated the need for additional beds, both in the Planning Area and at St, Francis . Per MultiCare: we agree that additional acute care bed capacity is needed in the Southeast King community . MultiCare Auburn receives a substantial number of transfers from St. Francis, and additional capacity at St. Francis could improve access to healthcare services. A summary of Step 10 from the numeric need methodology using 2019 as the baseline and set-up acute care beds is found in Table 5 . 10Table 5 Acute Care Bed Need Methodology Output Summary: Step 10 (Set -up Beds) 2019 2020 2021 2022 620 620 620 620 620 620 620 620 Gross Bed Need (Set -up Beds) 553 572 590 609 629 649 671 692 714 Net Bed Need/Surplus (Set -up Beds) (67) (48) (30) (11) 9 29 51 72 94 Source: Bed need methodology internal analysis 3. For existing facilities proposing to expand, identify the type of beds that will expand with this project. The 10 beds St. Francis proposes to retain will be used for general med/surg patients. As noted in response to earlier sections, St. Francis will increase its med/surg bed capacity from 96 to 14 8; assuming both projects ( CN application #22 -40 and this application) are approved. 4. For existing facilities, provide the facility's historical utilization for the last three full calendar years. The firs t table should only include the type(s) of beds that will increase with the project, the second table should include the entire hospital. Table 6 details patient days for the past three full calendar years for the type of beds that will increase with the project. Table 7 details the same information for the entire hospital. 11Table 6 St. Francis Acute Care Patient Days and Discharges, 2019 -2021 Excludes all Newborns2 Bed Type3 Project -Specific Only 79.1% 86.0% 22 22 22 OB 1,254 1,253 1,207 OB Patient Occupancy 27.8% 26.7% 26.7% Acute Care Licensed beds 118 118 118 Acute Care Available beds 118 118 118 Acute Care Discharges 7,257 6,806 6,974 Acute Care Patient days 30,681 29,938 Care % Occupancy 71.2% 69.3% 74.9 % Source: Applicant, discharges and days from CHARS, excludes all newborns and 6 level II bassinets Table 7 St. Francis Patient Days and Discharges, 2019 -2021 Excludes Normal Newborns Entire Hospital CY2019 CY2020 CY2021 Licensed beds 124 124 124 Available beds 124 124 124 Discharges 7,583 7,181 7,411 Source: Applicant, discharges and days from CHARS, excludes normal newborns (normal newborns do not occupy licensed beds so they are excluded in both Tables 6 and 7. 2 All newborns are excluded, including Level II, because there is no change to Level II basinets with this project. 3 Acute care beds are licensed only as such, however operationally St. Francis designates 96 beds as Med/Surg beds and 22 beds as OB/Postpartum beds 12 5. Provide projected utilization of the proposed facility for the first seven full years of operation if this project proposes an expansion to an existing hospital. Provide projected utilization for the first ten full years if this project proposes new facility. For existing facilities, also provide the information for intervening years between historical and projected. The first table should only include the type(s) of beds that will increase with the project, the second table should include the entire hospital. Include all assumptions used to make these projections. Tabl e 8 includes the intervening years of FY22 -FY23 in addition to the first seven full years of the project. This data assumes approval of the 24 beds requested in application # 22-40. Table 9 provides the same information for all acute care beds and the Level II Neonatal unit. In an effort to be conservative, SFH has assumed no growth in patient days beyond the 3 rd full year of the project. As noted in the introduction, St. Francis also did not assume any change in patient days from the 24 -bed addition application with this application. If the 10 beds requested in this application are not approved, SFH would operate at a higher occupancy level. Table 8 St. Francis Hospital Acute Care Patient Days and Discharges, FY2019 -FY2030 Excludes all Newborns Source: Applicant internal data, excludes all newborns The assumptions used to project discharges and patient days include: 24 b ed addition opens on July 1, 2023. The 10 beds requested in this application are made permanent in July 2023. Growth in census was anticipated with the opening of the 24 additional M ed/Surg beds only. Acute care days include Med/Surg services and Obstetrics services. ALOS for OB was held constant through the projection period based on FY2021 actual (ALOS of 1.76). Med/Surg ALOS SFH's FY2021 actual ALOS for Med/Surg patients.

The planning area is projected to grow at 3.25% annually (estimated annual growth rate of inpatient days for the Southeast King bed need methodology with 2019 as a baseline). In the intervening years, OB patient day growth was held to 0.5% annually (this is the same rate of growth as the female age 15 -44 age cohort). LOS held constant based on FY21 actual LOS (ALOS of 1.76). Growth in Med/Surg days in FY24, FY25, and FY26 is based on growth in patient days in the Southeast King Planning Area (3.25% annually). In addition, it is assumed St. Francis will be able to retain patients who have had to be transferred from the ED because of lack of capacity, resulting in an ADC growth of 2.0 in FY24; 1.0 ADC in FY25. For the last several years St. Francis has had to transfer between 56 and 93 patients per month. With the additional bed capacity, it has been assumed that a portion of these patients can be 'recaptured' and returned to St. Francis.

It has been assumed that the Level II discharges remain at a constant percentage of OB discharges (33.2%). ALOS remains constant based on FY21 actual LOS (ALOS of 2.20). Financial statements based upon the above utilization assumptions are included in Exhibit 5. 14 6. For existing facilities, provide patient origin zip code data for the most recent full c alendar year of operation. The requested information is included in Exhibit 6 . 7. Identify any factors in the planning area that currently restrict patient access to the proposed services. As detailed in Table 10, in 2019, St. Francis had the 3 rd highest midnight occupancy of all acute care hospitals in Washington State (7 5.5%); by 20 21, St. Francis was experiencing the 7th highest occupancy of any hospital statewide (7 4.9%). Between 2015 and 2021, occupancy at St. Francis has had a range of 69.5% to 78.3% . St. Francis has very little ability to increase its occupancy because of the limited Med/Surg capacity. It is worth noting that four of Franciscan Health's hospitals were consistently in the Top 10. Table 8 Top 10 Hospitals with Highest Percentage Occupancy 2015 - 2021 Hospital Name 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 (Hospital Unit is defined is acute), MDC19 is excluded from Harborview's occupancy data. Since 2015, and even with the opening of the new MultiCare Covington Hospital (which added 58 beds to the planning area), occupancy of hospitals in Southeast King has increased (this is demonstrated in Table 11). As can be seen in Table 11 , St. Francis has consistently had the highest occupancy, and has consistently operated above the State Health Plan target occupancy level. 15Table 9 Acute Care Occupancy (% of Licensed Beds) of Southeast King Hospitals 2015 - 2021 Target Midnight Occupancy per State Health Plan 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 newborns (Hospital Unit is defined is acute). St. Francis is the only Southeast King hospital located west of I -5. Approximately 45% of St. Francis' discharges come from the zip codes west of I -5. Additionally, of those who live west of I -5, more than one- third of patients who have an inpatient encounter are hospitalized at St. Francis; a rate nearly 40 percentage points higher than any other hospital in the Southeast King planning area. In addition, as was noted in the 24- bed application, St. Francis and MultiCare Covington serve different and distinct geographic areas of the SE King Planning Area. On the inpatient side, excluding normal newborns, in 2021, there were 419 unique DRGs for patients hospitalized at SFH. At MHS Covington, excluding normal newborns, there were a total of 262 DRGS; only 60% of what is seen at SFH. SFH also provides two tertiary services: an elective PCI program and a Level II nursery. SFH holds a Level IV trauma designation. Covington does not operate any tertiary service and does not have a trauma designation from the State. All of these factors are likely reflected in the nearly 40% higher case mix index differential of the two hospitals: 1.52 for SFH and 1.10 for Covington4. Case mix reflects the diversity, clinical complexity, and resource needs of all the patients in the hospital. A higher CMI indicates a more complex and resource -intensiv e case load. 4 Source: Washington State Hospital Association, Discharge Summary Report, 2021. 16As stated earlier, the State Health Plan's adjusted target occupancy for a hospital the size of St. Francis is 65%. St. Francis has, over the past three years, consistently exceeded the State Health Plan target of 65% with occupancy levels between 69 -75% as depicted in Table 11. More relevant to this project, the percent midnight occupancy of the 96 med/surg beds grew to nearly 86% during the most recent fiscal year ( Table 12). This is 32% higher than the standard. In FY2019, the med/surg beds were at 95% occupancy or greater at midnight approximately 5% of the time; by FY2021, this percentage had doubled. Forty -four percent of the time in FY19, midnight occupancy was 85% or greater; by FY2021, this had increased to 55%. Clearly, these high occupancy levels impact access. Note, occupancy data in Table 12 will not match occupancy data presented in other tables throughout the document as this table presents the number of inpatients in a bed at midnight each day by unit and type of bed on the unit.

However, it is helpful to look at St. Francis' 2020 experience, as well as 2021 and Q1 2022. This data confirms that more beds are needed to ensure the health care needs of the communities it primarily serves are being adequately met. In FY2021, St. Francis had an average daily med/surg census (all acute care beds less OB beds) of 82.4 and was at a med/surg occupancy level of nearly 86%, well above the 65% target midnight occupancy standard. With the inclusion of all acute care beds, St. Francis's ADC was 90.7 and 77% occupancy. While St. Francis averaged 77% average midnight occupancy for acute care beds in the most recent fiscal year (FY 2021), internal data shows that mid -day/mid -week (between 10AM and 1 PM), census is typically 30% higher, meaning that there were significant days and times of day when no beds were available, and patients were held in the ED or transferred to other hospitals. This trend has continued into Q1 2022. In fact, the Joint Commission noted in a recent survey the excessive levels of ED boarding at SFH; which is directly attributable to a lack of beds. St. Francis' continued high levels of occupancy is reducing its ability to serve its community. Table 13 illustrates the average number of patients that had to be transferred from the St. Francis Emergency Department each month as a result of lack of capacity or in limited cases, lack of clinical capability. Assuming an ALOS of only 4 days, the ADC in 2021 of these patient transfers, assuming all could have been accommodated at St. Francis, was 7.25. Table 11 Average Monthly and Yearly Emergency Department Transfers from St. Francis CY 2018 CY 2019 CY 2020 CY 2021 Monthly 93 91 67 55 Yearly 1,112 1,100 805 662 Source: Applicant In addition to the lack of capacity at St. Francis, there are a number of factors in the geography and socioeconomics of the communities served by St. Francis that make access more challenging than in many other King County communities. These challenges are compounded by the Public Health Emergency demonstrating that these communities are no longer assured accessible health care. 18Access to care for patients within the community who must use public transportation is particularly compromised: The King County Metro trip planner indicates when buses are running on schedule it takes approximately one hour to get from Federal Way to MultiCare Auburn Medical Center, requiring two transfers and then walking 0.4 miles from the bus station to the medical center. Travelling to Valley Medical Center is an even greater burden. Travel time to Valley Medical Center is nearly 2 hours, requiring three to four bus transfers. The communities served by St. Francis are among the most diverse and underserved in the state, and the socioeconomics of South King County have been extensively vetted by King County Public Health and other organizations, including Washington's Department of Health. For example, Public Health -Seattle & King County, Evergreen Health, VM Franciscan Health (St. Elizabeth Hospital, St. Francis Hospital, and St. Anne Hospital), Kaiser Permanente, MultiCare Health System (Auburn Medical Center and Covington Medical Center), Navos, Overlake Medical Center, Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, Seattle Children's, Swedish Medical Center (Ballard Campus, Cherry Hill Campus, First Hill Campus, Issaquah Campus), UW Medicine (Harborview Medical Center, Northwest Hospital & Medical Center, UW Medical Center and Valley Medical Center), Virginia Mason and the Washington State Hospital Association collectively produced the King County Community Health Needs Assessment 2018/2019. That Report found: \"People of color and low -income residents are at disproportionate risk of being uninsured and having poor health and social outcomes. Many health and social indicators \u2014such as housing quality, alcohol related deaths, obesity, lack of health insurance, and smoking \u2014show regional patterns of inequity. South King County is home to some of the most racially and ethnically diverse communities in our county, and experiences disparities in multiple health and social indicators. King County Public Health developed a tool to assess social and economic risk related to COVID -19 outcomes. Although the tool was designed to assess disparities in COVID -19 outcomes, many of the factors that cause disparities in these also related to general health care disparities. As illustrated in Figure 1 , residents of Southeast King including the areas surrounding St. Francis have both high social and economic risk placing residents at risk of disparities and vulnerability. 19Figure 1 : King County Social and Economic Risk Index Source: King County Public Health Social and Economic Disparities In the 2021/2022 King County Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA), residents of South King County, had a significantly shorter life expectancy compared to the King County Average (79.3 years compared to 81.7 years in King County), and of particular concern is that life expectancy in this region of the county has been declining for 10 years. This is likely due to the high level of chronic disease burdens in these communities, including statistically higher prevalence of chronic illnesses (hypertension and diabetes) compared to King County overall. 8. Identify how this project will be available and accessible to underserved groups. Admission to each of the FHS facilities and programs is based on clinical need. Services are made available to all persons regardless of age, race, color, creed, sex, national origin, ethnicity, religion, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, physical, me ntal or other disability, citizenship, medical condition, or income. A copy of Franciscan Health's policies is included as Exhibit 7 . 20 For hospital char ity care reporting purposes, the Department divides Washington State into five regions. St. Francis is located in the King County Region. Acc ording to 2018 -2020 charity care data produced by the Department (the latest data available), the three- year charity care average for the Region, excluding Harborview, was 1. 32% of gross revenue and 2.98% of adjusted revenue. During the same time frame, St. Francis's charity care was 1.61% and 4.31%, respectively. The percentage of charity care included in the pro forma is 1.37% of total revenue, which is based on St. Francis's actual FY2021; and is still beyond the King County average. 6 In addition to providing charity care at a higher rate than King County hospitals, excluding Harborview, St. Francis cares for a large percentage of Medicaid patients. St. Francis's percentage of Medicaid patients is 230% higher than the average of the other hospitals located in the Southeast King Planning area as shown in Table 14. Given the net need demonstrated by application of the acute care bed need projection methodology , FHS is confident that the case has been made for the beds to be made permanent at St. Francis. In the unlikely event that the CN Program does not identify numeric need for this project, Table 14 demonstrates the ability to approve the project under Criterion 2, which reads: CRITERION 2: Need for Multiple Criteria Hospital bed need forecasts are only one aspect of planning hospital services for specific groups of people. Bed need forecasts by themselves should not be the only criterion used to decide whether a specific group of people or a specific institution should develop additional beds, services or facilities. Even where the total bed supply serving a group of people or planning area is adequate, it may be appropriate to allow an individual institution to expand. 6 St. Francis notes that due to data extraction issues in the CHARS inpatient data base, there are no self -pay patients included in the 2019 data forward. This was an extraction issue only, not an upload issue. St. Francis has and will continue to serve self -pay patients. 21Standards: b. Under certain conditions, institutions may be allowed to expand even though the bed need forecasts indicate that there are underutilized facilities in the area. The conditions might include the following: The proposed development would significantly improve the accessibility or acceptability of services for underserved groups; or The proposed development would allow expansion or maintenance of an institution which has staff who have greater training or skill, or which has wider range of important services, or whose programs have evidence of better results than do neighboring and comparable institutions; or The proposed development would allow expansion of a crowded institution which has good cost, efficiency or productivity measures of its performance while underutilized services are located in neighboring and comparable institutions with higher costs, less efficient operations or lower productivity. In such cases, the benefits of expansion are judged to outweigh the potential costs of possible additional surplus.

For incomplete years, identify whether the data is annualized. Each requested data item is included in Exhibit 5. Utilization projections and assumptions were previously provided in Section 4, Question 5. 2. Identify the hospital's fiscal year. St. Francis's fiscal year ends on June 30. 3. Provide the following agreements/contracts: Management agreement Operating agreement Development agreement Joint Venture agreement St. Francis does not have any of the above agreements or contracts. This question is not applicable. 4. Provide documentation of site control. This could include either a deed to the site or a lease agreement for the site. If a lease agreement is provided, the terms must be for at least five years with options to renew for a total of 20 years. Included in Exhibit 8 is documentation from the King County Assessor's office demonstrating that CommonSpirit Health owns the site on which the hospital is located. 245. Provide county assessor information and zoning information for the site. If zoning information for the site is unclear, provide documentation or letter from the municipal authorities showing the proposed project is allowable at the identified site. If the site must undergo rezoning or other review prior to being appropriate for the proposed project, identify the current status of the process. Included in Exhibit 8 is documentation from the King County Assessor's office documenting that CommonSpirit Health owns the site on which the hospital is located , and its present use is a hospital. 6. Complete the table on the following page with the estimated capital expenditure associated with this project. If you include other line items not listed below, include the definition of the line item. Include all assumptions used to create the capital expenditure estimate. There are no capital expenditures for this project. Therefore, this question is not applicable. 7. Identify the entity responsible for the estimated capital costs. If more than one entity is responsible, provide breakdown of percentages and amounts for all. There are no capital expenditures for this project. Therefore, this question is not applicable. 8. Identify the start -up costs for this project. Include the assumptions used to develop these costs. Start -up costs should include any non -capital expenditure expenses incurred prior to the facility opening or initiating the proposed service. St. Francis is an existing operation. No start- up period is anticipated. 9. Identify the entity responsible for the start -up costs. If more than one entity is responsible, provide a breakdown of percentages and amounts for all. As discussed in response to the previous question, there is no start up period. This question is not applicable. 10. Provide a non -binding contractor's estimate for the construction cost s for the project. There are no capital expenditures for this project. Therefore, this question is not applicable. 25 11. Provide a detailed narrative supporting that the costs of the project, including any construction costs, will probably not result in an unreasonable impact on the costs and charges for health services in the planning area. There are no capital expenditures for this project. Therefore, this question is not applicable. 12. Provide the projected payer mix for the hospital by revenue and by patients using the example table below. Medicare and Medicaid managed care plans should be included within the Medicare and Medicaid lines, respectively. If \"other\" is a category, define what is included in \"other.\" St. Francis's projected payer mix is detailed in Table 15. Total hospital payer mix was assumed to change slightly because payer mix for med/surg patients is different from OB patients. The majority of the increase in patient days is assumed to be for med/surg patients. Table 15 St. Francis Hospital Projected Payer Mix Payer Mix Percentage by Gross Revenue Percentage by Patient Medicare 41.1% 43.0% Medicaid 22.0% 27.1% Commercial/Managed Care 100.0% 100.0% Source: Applicant 13. If this project proposes the addition of beds to an existing facility, provide the historical payer mix by revenue and patients for the existing facility. The table format should be consistent with the table shown above. St. Francis's historical payer mix based on Fiscal Year 2021 is detailed in Table 1 6. 26 Table 1613 St. Francis Hospital Historical Payer Mix (FY 2021) Payer Mix Percentage by Gross Revenue Percentage by Patient Medicare 40.8% 40.7% Medicaid 22.1% 24.2% Commercial/Managed Care 100.0% 100.0% Source: Applicant 14. Provide a listing of all new equipment proposed for this project. The list should include estimated costs for the equipment. If no new equipment is required, explain. There is no equipment proposed for this project. T his question is not applicable. 27Section 6 Structure and Process of Care (WAC 246 -310- 230) 1. Identify all licensed healthcare facilities owned, operated, or managed by the applicant. This should include all facilities in Washington State as well as any out-of-state facilities. Include applicable license and certification numbers. The requested information on other facilities owned/operated and or affiliated with Franciscan Health is included in Exhibit 9 . In addition, facilities that are part o f VM Franciscan Health are also included in Exhibit 9. 2. Provide a table that shows full time equivalents (FTEs) by type ( e.g., physicians, management, technicians, RNs, nursing assistants, etc.) for the facility. If the facility is currently in operatio n, include at least the most recent full year of operation, the current year, and projections through the first three full years of operation following project completion. There should be no gaps. All FTE types should be defined. The requested information is included in Exhibit 10. Note that the projections are the same as that included in the current CN for the 24 beds. 3. Provide the basis for the assumptions used to project the number and types of FTEs identified for this project. Salary expense corresponds to the FTEs needed to provide the service. FTEs increase in accordance with the increase in patient days. As required by CN Program guidelines, the projected FTEs do not assume any compensation increases. 284. Identify key staff ( e.g., chief of medicine, nurse manager, clinical director, etc.) by name and professional license number, if known. The key clinical staff are as follows: Table 14 St. Francis Hospital Key Staff Name Title Professional License Number Aparna Ananth, MD Division VP, Associate Chief Medical Officer King Region MD00045928 Holly Cook, RN Director, Nursing Operations RN00112119 Source: Applicant 5. Describe your methods for staff recruitment and retention. If any barriers to staff recruitment exist in the planning area, provide a detailed description of your plan to staff this project. While St. Francis is an operating unit of FHS, it is also a related organization to VM Franciscan Health . As such staff re cruitment and retention falls under VM Franciscan Health. Therefore, VM Franciscan Health fully acknowledges the current workforce issues experienced by all health care providers, due in part to COVID burnout and challenged by the desire to support and embrace diversity, inclusion, and equity. To ensure the workforce needs are a top priority, VM Franciscan Health employs a Director of Workforce Development. All levels of CommonSpirit Health and VM Franciscan Health are focused on workforce development, retention and efficiencies, including signing bonuses and referral bonuses for front line clinical staff, mid -year market increases, broad based appreciation bonuses, and staffing incentives for extra shifts. For an organization the size of VM Franciscan Health, and because this project proposes an expansion of an existing facility, and importantly, the rightsizing of it to support current and projected volumes, the staffing needs noted in Exhibit 1 0 are relatively small. In an effort to assure that we always have the staff needed to support our existing and proposed new programs, VM Franciscan Health offers a competitive wage and benefit package as well as numerous other recruitment and retention strategies. It also recognizes that this is an extraordinary time with regard to staffing. Updated patient care areas and a less crowded environment will help to provide a more attractive experience for staff. Specific strategies for clinical, ancillary and support staff include: VM Franciscan Health offers, and will continue to offer, a generous benefit package for both full and part time employees that includes Medical, Dental, Paid Time Off/Extended Illness/Injury Time, Employee Assistance Plans, and a Tuition Reimbursement Program, among other benefits. 29 VM Franciscan Health posts all of its openings on our website via our online applicant tracking system. In addition to our own website, VM Franciscan Health has agreements with several job boards including Indeed.com, Health -e-Careers, and Washington HealthCare News to name a few. VM Franciscan Health currently has contracts with more than 40 technical colleges, community colleges, and four -year universities throughout the United States that enable us to offer either training and/or job opportunities. In addition, VM Franciscan Health Education Services staff serves on healthcare program advisory boards and as clinical or affiliate faculty at a number of local institutions. VM Franciscan Health constantly monitors the \"wage\" market, adjusting as necessary to ensure that our hospitals' wage structures remains competitive. VM Franciscan Health provides a career counselor who is available to all staff to encourage development and growth within the healthcare industry. This is furth er supported through a tuition reimbursement program and referrals to state and federal funds for continuing education. In addition, the Franciscan Foundation has annual scholarships available for current employees to advance their education. VM Franciscan Health's various facilities serve as clinical training sites for healthcare specialties such as nursing, diagnostic imaging, physical/occupational therapy, and pharmacy, (to name a few). V M Franciscan Health also offers various other recruitment strategies (i.e., new nursing grad events, nursing school class visits, job fairs, career days, direct e- mail campaigns, etc.) as other ways to bring new healthcare workers to the VM Franciscan Health organization. V M Franciscan Health works closely with agency personnel, not only to negotiate rates but to also ensure that agency staff is able to provide the same high -quality skill level that VM Franciscan Health requires of our own employees. VM Franciscan Health holds residency program RN career fairs twice a year to help recruit and train new RNs. They go through a formal residency program at the site and in the department, they are hired into. VM Franciscan Health also attends campus career fairs and speaks with graduating RN classes about our opportunities and training for new nurses. We advertise on popular job boards as well as specialty niche sites . Based on the above, St. Francis has demonstrated that it has the necessary infrastructure in place to recruit the additional staff needed for this project. 30 6. For new facilities, provide a listing of ancillary and support services that will be established. St. Francis is not a new facility. This question is not applicable. 7. For existing facilities, provide a listing of ancillary and support services already in place. The existing ancillary and support services, and an indication as to whether they are provided in house or under agreement, are provided in Table 18. Table 15 Ancillary and Support Services Services Provided Vendor Linen service In-house Pathology Cellnetix Janitorial services In-house Biomedical In-house Dietary In-house Respiratory Therapy In-house Source: Applicant 8. Identify whether any of the existing ancillary or support agreements are expected to change as a result of this project. No existing ancillary or support agreements are expected to change as a result of this project. 9. If the facility is currently opera ting, provide a listing of healthcare facilities with which the facility has working relationships. St. Francis works closely with most healthcare providers in Southeast King County, as well as the larger South King County region, Tacoma, the greater Pierce County area, and Seattle. This includes EMS, primary care and specialty clinics, other hospitals, nursing homes, assisted living communities, home health and hospice. 3110. Identify whether any of the existing working relationships with healthcare facilities listed above would change as a result of this project. No existing working relationships are expected to change as a result of this project. 11. For a new facility, provide a listing of healthcare facilities with which the facility would establish working relationships. This question is not applicable. 12. Provide an explanation of how the proposed project will promote continuity in the provision of health care services in the planning area, and not result in an unwarranted fragmentation of services. The additional med/surg beds will promote continuity of care particularly considering the access issues outlined in the Need section. St. Francis' already high occupancy is compounded by the community's health disparities, and socioeconomic challenges. An adequate number of med/surg beds, located close to where patients reside, provides the best opportunity to assure patients get timely care, and that continuity from the hospital to the other levels of care in their local communities is maintained. Approval of the project will promote timely access to inpatient service by enhancing St. Francis's bed capacity. 13. Provide an explanation of how the proposed project will have an appropriate relationship to the service area's existing health care system as required in WAC 246- 310- 230(4). As noted above, St. Francis has a long track record of working closely with EMS, other existing hospitals, and other health care systems throughout the Puget Sound Region. St. Francis collaborates with area nursing homes, assisted living, adult family homes, home health, and hospice agencies as well as outpatient providers. St. Francis also supports area primary care and specialists, as well as insurers to assure care coordination, smooth transitions of care, and reduced rehospitalization and ED visits. 32 14. Identify whether any facility or practitioner as sociated with this application has a history of the actions listed below. If so, provide evidence that the proposed or existing facility can and will be operated in a manner that ensures safe and adequate care to the public and conforms to applicable federal and state requirements. a. A criminal conviction which is reasonably related to the applicant's competency to exercise responsibility for the ownership or operation of a health care facility; or b. A revocation of a license to operate a healthcare facility; or c. A revocation of a license to practice as a health profession; or d. Decertification as a provider of services in the Medicare or Medicaid program because of failure to comply with applicable federal conditions of participation. No facility or pra ctitioner associated with the application has any history with respect to the above. 33 Section 7 Cost Containment (WAC 246 -310- 240) 1. Identify all alternatives considered prior to submitting this project. At a minimum include a brief discussion of this project versus no project. The only alternative to this certificate of need was to have a transition plan to remove the beds from operation by October 27. 2. Provide a comparison of this project with alternatives rejected by the applicant. Include t he rationale for considering this project to be superior to the rejected alternatives. Factors to consider can include, but are not limited to patient access to healthcare services, capital cost, legal restrictions, staffing impacts, quality of care, and cost or operation efficiency. Table 19 details the requested information. Table 16 Advantages and Disadvantages Make the 10 beds Permanent Beds Removed from Service Patient Access to Health Care Services Reduces barriers to access for our community. Continue to face occupancy pressures and patient access is compromised. Capital Costs Most efficient use of capital as no capital investment required. Not applicable Staffing Impact More efficient use of staffing with additional bed capacity. Not applicable Quality of Care Positive im pact on inpatient capacity as likely to reduce ED boarding and transfers . Not applicable Cost or Operational Efficiency Lower costs and enhanced operational efficiency through less boarding in the ED, reduced transfers , optimizing staffing and improving workflow . No opportunity to improve operational efficiency. Space will continue to be used inefficiently. Legal None Not applicable Source: Applicant 34 3. If the project involves construction, provide information that supports conformance with WAC 246- 310- 240(2): The costs, scope, and methods of construction and energy conservation are reasonable; and The project will not have an unreasonable impact on the costs and charges to the public of providing health services by other persons. T here is no construction proposed for this project. This question is not applicable. 4. Identify any aspects of the project that will involve appropriate improvements or innovations in the financing and delivery of health services which foster cost containment, and which promote quality assurance and cost effectiveness. As a result of more efficient operations, the cost per patient day is reduced with this project. Also, as noted throughout this application, St. Francis currently operates at extremely high census. As a result, clinical staff often find themselves spending considerable time and energy engaged in non- clinical activity (i.e., monitoring/managing patients in hallways, moving patients from one area to another, calling other units to arrange logistics, etc.). Alleviating this problem through the addition of acute beds will result in a much more efficient use of staff time and skill. In addition, while not specific to staff and system efficiencies, the ability for St. Francis to care for patients needing care in a timely manner is expected to improve overall patient satisfaction and ultimately, outcomes. The purpose of this CN application is not to capture additional volume, rather it is to provide additional relief in the day- to -day operations of the Hospital. The 10 beds achieve this by slightly reducing midnight occupancy levels: with the 24 additional beds, midnight occupancy on medical/surgical beds was expected to be 73% in 2026 , with the 10 additional beds, it is expected to be 68% . This relief helps optimize current staffing and processes; and provides flexibility during surge periods. 35Exhibit 1 Organizational Chart 36 Figure 1 Organizational Chart St. Francis Hospital St. Clare Hospital St. Anne HospitalSt. Anthony HospitalSt. Joseph Medical CenterSt. Michael Medical CenterVirginia Mason Medical Center Franciscan Health System dba CHI FranciscanVirginia Mason Franciscan Health St. Elizabeth HospitalCommonSpirit Health Virginia Mason Health System 37Ketul Patel CEO, Virginia Mason Franciscan Health & Division President, Pacific Northwest, CommonSpirit Health David Schultz SVP , Operations Virginia Mason Franciscan Health Russell Wooley COO St. Francis Hospital Holly Cook, RN Director, Nursing OperationsAparna Ananth, MD Division VP , Associate Chief Medical Officer, King RegionMichael Anderson, MD Division SVP and Chief Medical Officer Virginia Mason Franciscan Health Hannah Bennett, RN Director, Perioperative ServicesKelle Dragich, RN Director, Family Birth CenterJim Shreve Manager, Diagnostic Imaging / Women's Health & Breast Center Carrie Roberts, Program Manager, BariatricsMarvin O'Quinn President and COO , CommonSpirit Health 38Exhibit 2 Letter of Intent 394041Exhibit 3 Single Line Drawings 42432019 Baseline Bed Need Methodology 44Step 1 1. 2010-2019 Total Resident Days Excludes MDC 19 and MDC 15, Rehab Service Line 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Adjusted to Exclude All Psychiatric Patient Days 2-A. 2010-2019 Total Resident Days (from Step 1) Excludes MDC 19, MDC 15, Rehab 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Patient Days Excludes MDC 19, MDC 15, Rehab 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Southeast King 192 are 4 psychiatric hospitals statewide: Navos, Seattle: Located in HSA 1 and Southeast King Planning Area Lourdes Counseling Center, Richland: Located in HSA 3 and Benton-Franklin Planning Area 2C. 2010-2019 Total Resident Days Adjusted to Exclude All Psychiatric Patient Days Excludes MDC 19, MDC 15, Rehab 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 in HSA 1 and Southeast King Planning Area 46STEP 3: Historical Average Use Rates 3-A. 2010-2019 Total Resident Days Adjusted to Exclude All Psychiatric Patient Days (from Step 2-C.)

Bad Debt: assumed to be 0 .93% of gross revenue (based on FY 2021). All information provided in current dollars. No inflation is assumed. Project start date 7 /1/2023 The per patient day assumption is based on adjusted patient day. The estimated adjusted patient days are as follows: Ad justed Patient Days by Fiscal days were used for the following financial assumptions: Other Operating R evenue, Supplies, Purchased Services -Other, Rentals and Leases and Other Direct Expenses1. Other operating revenue: The assumption was $37 per adjusted patient day for the variable portion of the revenue. The fixed portion of the revenue was assumed to remain constant based on FY2021 actuals (less CARES Act Revenue). Outpatient utilization was assumed to increase by 2% per year Deductions from Revenue are provided for the hospital with and without the project. G ross patient revenue for the 'without' scenario was calculated using the same rates and utilization of services as in the baseline period of FY2021. Payer mix for the 'with' scenario changes slightly because of the increase in patient days associated with med/surg volumes . No reimbursement changes were used in the pro forma. Thus, the net patient revenue per case changes slightly from the baseline period of FY2021. No increase in charges was assumed. Other operating revenue which includes the cafeteria and gift shop sales , was assumed to be $ 37 per patient day . 1 In addition to the variable component based on adjusted patient days, there is also a fixed component for Purchased Services -Other ($128,000) and Other Direct Expenses ($52,000). 78 Salary expense corresponds to the FTEs needed to provide the service. FTEs increase in accordance with the increase in patient days. This level of productivity is based upon the productivity that occurred in FY2021. The statement does not include any compensation increases. Employee benefits are kept at the same percentage of salary as FY2021 or 23.1% throughout the projection period. Purchased Services -Utilities: Without the project, Purchased Services -Utilities are assumed to be the same as FY2021. With THE PROJECT, an increase of $29,000 has been assumed annually associated with an increase of 2% of the utility expense in FY2021. Insurance: Without the project, Insurance is assumed to be the same as FY2021. With THE PROJECT, an increase of $57,000 which is an increase of 2% of the insurance expense in FY2021. Licenses and Taxes: 0.9515% of net patient revenue for B&O taxes for the without project and 1% of net patient service revenue for the project. Depreciation expense that is independent of the project is provided from our internal fixed asset system and assumes there is zero capital spending in the projected years (years beyond FY21). Accordingly, the depreciation expense is decreasing each year as historical assets become fully depreciated. Depreciation expense associated with THE PROJECT has $16,098,000 of Building Costs being depreciated over 30 years and $4,388,000 of Equipment costs being depreciated over 10 years. Administrative adjustments are discounts provided to patients on a case by case basis. Administrative adjustments for THE PROJECT are calculated at $7.00 per admission. Administrative adjustments for THE WITHOUT are from our system and are about 1.15% of gross revenues. Purchased services -other : This line item contains fees paid to CHI Franciscan's parent company, CHI, for services provided to CHI Franciscan such as Legal, Compliance, Information Technology, and Revenue Cycle. This line item also includes payments to vendors for such things as, laundry service, security services, etc. Several of St. Francis's support departments, such as Dietary, are managed by outside companies that have expertise in managing these types of services. Payments for these type of management services are included in this expense category. The vast majority of these costs are fixed and do not fluctuate with changes in volumes. Those services that do fluctuate to volume have a cost assumed to be $53 per adjusted patient day. Supplies expense increases proportionate to the increase in patient days. Supplies were assumed to be $ 480 per adjusted patient day . With the exception of the capital associated with the Project, there is no other capital spending. Depreciation expense is the natural wind down of past capital spending combined with the deprec iation associated with the Project. Medical professional fees are assumed to remain unchanged with the project. 79 Rentals and leases are assumed to increase by $10 per adjusted pati ent day (for specialized medical equipment.) Licenses and taxes are assumed to be fixed with the exception of B&O tax which is assumed to be approximately 1% of the net patient service revenue. Other direct expenses are assumed to be fixed with the exception of an annual increase of $52,000 that is associated with the general assessment that CHI's parent company charges and is recorded in this expense category. Also, a small amount of costs are assumed to be variable at $16 per adjusted patient day. These variable costs include but are not limited to: bank fees, dues/subscriptions, education, travel postage. Contractual Allowances: Other under Contractual Adjustments refers to contractual adjustments which do not fall into the categories which are listed above (Medicare, Medicaid, Workers Compensation, Other Government Programs, or Negotiated Rates). This is a standard template VMFH uses for all CN proformas, and in the case of St. Francis' historical financials, there have been zero Other contractual adjustments. Other Adjustments and Allowances/Administrative Adjustments under Deductions from Revenue refer to administrative adjustments that St. Francis makes to its gross revenue. Types of adjustments that may be included are reductions in gross revenue for procedures which are part of a package of services, or other reductions to gross revenue (not including contractual adjustment, bad debt or charity care) which St. Francis uses for business/administrative needs. 80Attachment 1 St. Franc is Hospital Revised Financials 81Wi thout the Project 82HOSPITAL INFORMATION COMPARISON STATEMENT OF REVENUE & EXPENSE-UNRESTRICTED -

D. \"Eligibility Qualification Period\" means that Patients approved to be eligible shall be granted Financial Assistance for all eligible accounts incurred for services received twenty - 106Effective Date: July 1, 2022 Page 2 of 6 Addendum Finance G-003A -3: Financial Assistance - Washington Governance Policy Addendum \u00a9 Copyright 2022 CommonSpirit Health. For Internal Use Only four (24) months prior to the determination date (plus the fourteen (14) day determinati on period), and prospectively for a period of six (6) months following the determination date. If eligibility is approved based on Presumptive Eligibility criteria, Financial Assistance will also be applied to all eligible accounts incurred for services received twenty -four (24) months prior to the determination date. ELIGIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE A. No minimum account balance shall be required for a patient to qualify for Financial Assistance. B. Pursuant to the terms of the Financial Assistance Policy, unless eligible for Presumptive Financial Assistance, certain eligibility criteria must be met in order for a patient to qualify for Financial Assistance. This Addendum updates such eligibility criteria with the following: Any patient whose Family Income is at or below 300% percent of the FPL shall receive a full discount from his or her account balance for Appropriate Hospital Based Medical Services and Emergency Care or Emergency S ervices provided to the patient after payment, if any, by third-party payers or sponsors . Any patient whose Family Income is between 301% to 350% of the FPL shall receive discounted care up to 75% , which may be reduced from his or her account balance for Appropriate Hospital Based Medical Services and Emergency Care or Emergency Serv ices provided to the p atient after payment, if any, by third-party payers or sponsors, and any amounts reasonably related to assets considered as set forth in the Hospital Facility's Policy on Asset Testing. Any patient whose Family Income is between 351% to 400% of the FPL shall receive discounted care up to 50% from his or her account balance for Appropriate Hospital Based Medical Services and Emergency Care or Emergency Serv ices provided to the patient after payment, if any, by any third- party payers or sponsors, and any amounts reasonably related to assets considered as set forth in the Hospital Facility's Policy on Asset Testing. In the event a Hospital Facility provides discounted care greater than what is required above (either through amounts generally billed (\"AGB\"), self-pay, or other discounts) the patient shall receive that greater discounted care amount. C. With respect to those assets that may be taken into consideration, Hospital Facility will seek only such information regarding assets as is reasonably necessary and readily available to determine the existence, availability, and value of such assets . Hospital Facility will consider assets and collect information related to such assets as required by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid ( \"CMS \") for Medicare cost reporting. Such information may include reporting of assets convertible to cash and unnecessary for the patient's daily living. Duplicate forms of verification will not be requested and only one current account statement is required to verify monetary assets. If no documentation for an asset is available, a written and signed statement from the patient or guarantor is sufficient. 107Effective Date: July 1, 2022 Page 3 of 6 Addendum Finance G-003A -3: Financial Assistance - Washington Governance Policy Addendum \u00a9 Copyright 2022 CommonSpirit Health. For Internal Use Only Asset information will not be used for collection activities. The following types of assets shall be excluded from consideration: The first $5,000 of monetary assets for an individual or $8,000 of monetary assets for a family of two, plus an additional $1,500 of monetary assets for each additional family member. The value of any asse t that has a penalty for early withdrawal shall be the value of the asset after the penalty has been paid; Any equity in a primary residence; Retirement plans other than 401(k) plans; One motor vehicle and a second motor vehicle if it is necessary for empl oyment or medical purposes; Any prepaid burial contract or burial plot; and Any life insurance policy with a face value of $10,000 or less. D. \"Patient Cooperation Standards,\" as defined in the Financial Assistance Policy, shall only apply to the extent they: allow the Hospital Facility to pursue reimbursement from any third-party coverage that may be identified to the Hospital Facility, in accordance with WAC 246-453-020(1); allow the Hospital Facility to make every reasonable effort to determine the existence or nonexistence of third-party sponsorship that might cover in full or in part the charges for services provided to each patient, in accordance with WAC 246-453-020(4); and do not impose application procedures for charity care sponsorship which place an unreasonable burden upon the responsible party, taking into account any physical, mental, intellectual, or sensory deficiencies or language barriers which may hinder the responsible party's capability of complying with the application procedures, i n accordance with WAC 246-453-020(5). E. Eligibility for Financial Assistance requires that a person be a Washington State resident and that the medical services sought are Appropriate Hospital -Based Medical Services, as opposed to services which are investigational, elective or experimental in nature. If a person is not a Washington State resident, that person is not eligible for Financial Assistance when that person enters Washington State solely for the purpose of seeking medical care. Refugees, asylees, and those seeking asylum are exempt from the Washington State residency requirement for Financial Assistance eligibility. Also exempt from the Washington State residency requirement are those patients in need of Emergency Care or Emergency Services. Financial Assistance will not be denied based on immigration status. Exceptions to residence and scope of services requirements outlined in this paragraph may be made with the approval of the Hospital Facility Chief Financial Officer or their designee. THE METHO D FOR APPLYING FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE A. For the purposes of reaching an initial determination of sponsorship status, Hospital Facilities shall rely upon information provided orally by the responsible party. The Hospital Facility may require the responsible party to sign a statement attesting to the accuracy of the information provided to the Hospital Facility for purposes of the initial determination of 108Effective Date: July 1, 2022 Page 4 of 6 Addendum Finance G-003A -3: Financial Assistance - Washington Governance Policy Addendum \u00a9 Copyright 2022 CommonSpirit Health. For Internal Use Only sponsorship status, in accordance with WAC 246-453-030(1). In accordance with WAC 246-453-020(1), if the initial determination of sponsorship status indicates that the responsible party may meet the criteria for classification as an indigent person, collection efforts directed at the responsible party will be precluded pending a final determination of that classification, provided that the responsible party is cooperative with the H ospital Facility 's reasonable efforts to reach a final determination of sponsorship status . B. In accordance with WAC 246-453-030(2), in addition to the documents listed in the Financial Assistance Policy, any one of the following documents shall be considered sufficient evidence upon which to base the final determination of charity care sponsorship status, when the income information is annualized as may be appropriate: Forms approving or denying eligibility for Medicaid or state-funded medical assistance; Forms approving or denying unemployment compensation; or Written statements from employers or welfare agencies. C. If there is indication that due to the patient's mental, physical or intellectual capacity, or due to a language barrier, completing the application procedure would place an unreasonable burden on the patients, the Hospital Facility will take reasonable measures to facilitate the application process, including engaging an interpreter to assist the patient through the application process if necessary. D. Hospital Facilities shall make every reasonable effort to reach initial and final determinations of eligibility for financial assistance in a timely manner. Nevertheless, Hospital Facilities shall make those determinations at any time, even after the Application Period, upon learning of facts or receiving the documentation described herein, indicating that the responsible party's income is equal to or below three hundred percent (300%) of the federal poverty guidelines as adjusted for family size. The timing of reaching a final determination of eligibility for financial assistance shall have no bearing on the Hospital Facility's identification of charity care deductions from revenue as distinct from bad debts. WAC 246- 453-020(10). E. Any responsible party who has been initially determined to meet the criteria for receiving financial assistance shall be provided with at least fourteen (14) calendar days or such time as the person's medical condition may require, or such time as may be reasonably necessary to secure and to present documentation described within WAC 246-453-03 0 prior to receiving a final determination of sponsorship status. F. In accordance with WAC 246-453-030(4), in the event that the responsible party is not able to provide any of the documentation described above, the Hospital Facility shall rely upon written and signed statements from the responsible party for making a final determination of eligibility for classification as an indigent person. G. In accordance with WAC 245-453-030(5), information requests from the Hospital Facility to the responsible party for the verification of income and family size shall be limited to that which is reasonably necessary and readily available to substantiate the responsible party's qualification for charity sponsorship, and may not be used to discourage applications for such sponsorship. Only those facts relevant to eligibility may 109Effective Date: July 1, 2022 Page 5 of 6 Addendum Finance G-003A -3: Financial Assistance - Washington Governance Policy Addendum \u00a9 Copyright 2022 CommonSpirit Health. For Internal Use Only be verified, and duplicate forms of verification shall not be demanded. H. The Hospital Facility shall notify persons applying for financial assistance of their final determination of sponsorship status within fourteen (14) calendar days of receiving information in accordance with WAC 246-453-020(7); such notification shall include a determination of the amount for which the responsible party will be held financially accountable. I. In the event that the Hospital Facility denies the responsible party's application for financial assistance, the Hospital Facility shall notify the responsible party of the denial within fourteen (14) days and provide the basis for the denial . J. In the event that a responsible party pays a portion or all of the charges related to Appropriate Hospital Based Medical Services and Emergency Care or Emergency Services, and is subsequently found to have met the financial assistance criteria at the time that services were provided, any payments in excess of the amount determined to be appropriate shall be refunded to the patient within thirty (30) days of achieving the charity care designation. WAC 246-453-020(11). K. In accordance with WAC 246-453-020(6), Hospital Facilities shall not require deposits from those responsible parties whose income is equal to or below three hundred percent (300%) of the federal poverty guidelines as adjusted for family size, as indicated through an initial determination of sponsorship status . L. For services provided to patients on or after July 1, 2022, the following procedures will apply for identifying patients and/or their guarantors who may be eligible for health care coverage through Washington medical assistance programs or the Washington Health Benefit Exchange: As a part of the application process for determining eligibility for Financial Assistance and charity care, Hospital Facility will query as to whether a patient or their guarantor meets the criteria for health care coverage under medical assistance programs under chapter 74.09 RCW or the Washington Health Benefit Exchange. As part of the Financial Assistance process, Hospital Facility staff will also work with patients/families who do not have applicable third-party coverage to assess whether such patients/families may be eligible for Medicaid and/or health care coverage through Washington's Health Benefit Exchange (RCW 43.71). Staff will provide assistance with Medicaid and Qualified Health Plan applications and including but not limited to providing the patient/family with information about the application process, assisting patients through the application pr ocess, providing necessary forms that must be completed, and/or connecting the patient/family with other agencies or resources who can assist the patient/family in completing such applications. In providing assistance to the application process, Hospital Facility will take into account any physical, mental, intellectual, sensory deficiencies or language barriers which may hinder either the patient or their guarantor from complying with the application procedures and will not impose procedures on the patient or guarantor that would constitute an unreasonable burden. If the patient or guarantor fails to make reasonable efforts to cooperate with 110Effective Date: July 1, 2022 Page 6 of 6 Addendum Finance G-003A -3: Financial Assistance - Washington Governance Policy Addendum \u00a9 Copyright 2022 CommonSpirit Health. For Internal Use Only Hospital Facility in applying for coverage under chapter 74.09 RCW or the Washington Health Benefit Exchange, Hos pital Facility is not obligated to provide charity care to such patient. The Hospital Facility shall not require a patient to apply for any public or private programs where the patient is categorically ineligible or has been deemed ineligible in the prior 12 months. PRESUMPTIVE ELIGIBILITY In the event the responsible party's identification as an indigent person is obvious to Hospital Facility personnel, and the Hospital Facility personnel are able to establish the position of the income level within the broad criteria described in RCW 70.170.060, based on the individual life circumstances contained within the Financial Assistance Policy or otherwise, the Hospital Facility is not obligated to establish the exact income level or to request documentation from the responsible party, unless the responsible party requests further review. APPEALS A. All responsible parties denied financial assistance shall be provided with, and notified of, an appeals procedure that enables them to correct any deficiencies in documentation or request review of the denial and results in review of the determination by the Hospital Facility's chief financial officer. B. Responsible parties shall be notified that they have thirty (30) calendar days within which to request an appeal of the final determination of their eligibility for financial assistance. Within the first fourteen (14) days of this period, the Hospital Facility shall not refer the account at issue to an external collection agency. If the Hospital Facility has initiated collection activities and discovers an appeal has been filed, it shall cease collection efforts until the appeal is finalized. After the fourteen (14) day period, if no appeal has been filed, the hospital may initiate collection activities. C. If the final determination of the appeal affirms the previous denial of financial assistance, the Hospital Facility shall send written notification to the responsible party and the Department of Health in accordance with state law. All other terms set forth in CommonSpirit Governance Policy Finance G -003, Financial Assistance, remain unaltered. 111 Effective Date: July 1, 2022 Page 1 of 11 Financial Assistance Policy \u00a9 Copyright 2022 CommonSpirit Health. COMMONSPIRIT HEALTH GOVERNANCE POLICY SUBJECT: Financial Assistance EFFECTIVE DATE: July 1, 202 2 POLICY NUMBER: Finance G -003 ORIGINAL EFFECTIVE DATE: July 1, 2021 POLICY Pursuant to Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 501(r), in order to remain tax -exempt, each CommonSpirit Health Hospital Organization is required to establish a written Financial Assistance Policy (FAP) and an Emergency Medical Care Policy which apply to all Emergency Medical Care and Medically Necessar y Care (herein referred to as EMCare) provided in a Hospital Facility. The purpose of this Policy is to describe the conditions under which a Hospital Facility provides Financial Assistance to its patients. In addition, this Policy describes the actions a Hospital Facility may take in the event of nonpayment of a patient account. SCOPE This Policy applies to CommonSpirit and each of its tax -exempt Direct Affiliates1 and tax - exempt Subsidiaries2 that operate a Hospital Facility (referred to individually as a CommonSpirit Hospital Organization and collectively as CommonSpirit Hospital Organizations). It is the policy of CommonSpirit to provide, without discrimination, EMCare in CommonSpirit Hospit al Facilities to all patients, without regard to a patient's financial ability to pay. PRINCIPLES As Catholic health care providers and tax -exempt organizations, CommonSpirit Hospital Organizations are called to meet the needs of patients and others who seek care, regardless of their financial abilities to pay for services provided. The following pr inciples are consistent with CommonSpirit's mission to deliver compassionate, high-quality, affordable healthcare services and to advocate for those who are poor and vulnerable. It is the desire of CommonSpirit Hospital Organizations that the financial abi lity of people who need health care services does not prevent them from seeking or receiving care. 1 A Direct Affiliate is any corporation of which CommonSpirit Health is the sole corporate member or sole shareholder, as well as Dignity Community Care, a Colorado nonprofit corporation. 2 A Subsidiary refers to either an organization, whether nonprofit or for-profit, in which a Direct Affiliate holds the power to appoint fifty percent (50%) or more of the voting members of the governing body of such organization or holds fifty percent (50%) or more of the voting rights in such organization (as evidenced by membership powers or securities conferring certain decision -making authority on the Direct Affiliate) or any organization in which a Subsidiary holds such power or voting rights. 112 Effective Date: July 1, 2022 Page 2 of 11 Financial Assistance Policy \u00a9 Copyright 2022 CommonSpirit Health. CommonSpirit Hospital Organizations will provide, without discrimination, Emergency Medical Care to individuals regardless of their eligibility for Financia l Assistance or for government assistance in CommonSpirit Hospital Facilities. CommonSpirit Hospital Organizations are dedicated to providing Financial Assistance to persons who have health care needs and are uninsured, underinsured, ineligible for a gove rnment program, or otherwise unable to pay, for non -emergent Medically Necessary Care provided in CommonSpirit Hospital Facilities. APPLICATION A. This Policy applies to: All charges for EMCare provided in a Hospital Facility by a CommonSpirit Hospital Organization. All charges for EMCare provided by a physician or advanced practice clinician who is employed by a CommonSpirit Hospital Organization if such care is provided within a Hospital Facility. All charges for EMCare provided by a physician or adva nced practice clinician who is employed by a Substantially -Related Entity that occurs within a Hospital Facility. Non-covered Medically Necessary Care provided to patients where the patient would bear responsibility for the charges, such as charges for da ys beyond a length of stay limit or in circumstances where the patient's benefits have been exhausted. Collection and recovery activities shall be conducted in accordance with the CommonSpirit Governance Policy Finance G -004, Billing and Collections . B. Coordination with Other Laws The provision of Financial Assistance may be subject to additional laws or regulations pursuant to federal, state or local laws. Such law governs to the extent it imposes more stringent requirements than this Policy. In the event that a subsequently adopted state or local law directly conflicts with this Policy, the CommonSpirit Hospital Organization shall, after consultation with its local CommonSpirit Legal Team representative, CommonSpirit Revenue Cycle leadership, and CommonSp irit Tax leadership, be permitted to adopt an addendum to this Policy before the next policy review cycle, with such minimal changes to this Policy as are necessary to achieve compliance with any applicable laws. DEFINITIONS Amounts Generally Billed (AGB) means the maximum charge a patient who is eligible for Financial Assistance under this Financial Assistance Policy is personally responsible for paying, after all deductions and discounts (including discounts available under this Policy) have been applied and less any amounts reimbursed by insurers. No patient eligible for Financial Assistance will be charged more than the AGB for EMCare provided to the patient. CommonSpirit calculates the AGB on a Facility -by-Facility basis u sing the \"lookback\" method by multiplying the \"Gross Charges\" for any EMCare that it provides by AGB percentages, which are based upon past claims allowed under Medicare and private insurance as set forth in 113 Effective Date: July 1, 2022 Page 3 of 11 Financial Assistance Policy \u00a9 Copyright 2022 CommonSpirit Health. federal law. \"Gross Charges\" for these purposes means the amount listed on each Hospital Facility's chargemaster for each EMCare service. Application Period means the time provided to patients by the CommonSpirit Hospital Organization to complete the Financial Assistance application. It expires on the later of (i) 365 days from the patient's discharge from the Hospital Facility or the date of the patient's EMCare, or (ii) 240 days from the date of the initial post -discharge bill for the EMCare received at a Hospital Facility. CommonSpirit Entity Servi ce Area means, for purposes of this Policy, the community served by a Hospital Facility as described in its most recent Community Health Needs Assessment, as described in IRC Section 501(r)(3). Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) is conducted by a H ospital Facility at least once every three (3) years pursuant to IRC Section 501(r)(1)(A); each CommonSpirit Hospital Organization then adopts strategies to meet the community health needs identified through the CHNA. Eligibility Determination Period - For purposes of determining Financial Assistance eligibility, a Hospital Facility will review annual Family Income from the prior six -month (6) period, or the prior tax year as shown by recent pay stubs or income tax returns and other information. Proof of earnings may be determined by annualizing the year -to-date Family Income, taking into consideration the current earnings rate. Eligibility Qualification Period - After submitting the Financial Assistance application and supporting documents, patients app roved to be eligible shall be granted Financial Assistance for all eligible accounts incurred for services received twelve (12) months prior to the determination date , and prospectively for a period of six (6) months from the determination date. If eligi bility is approved based on Presumptive Eligibility criteria, Financial Assistance will also be applied to all eligible accounts incurred for services received twelve (12) months prior to the determination date. Emergency Medical Care, EMTALA - Any patien t seeking care for an emergency medical condition within the meaning of Section 1867 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395dd) at a Hospital Facility shall be treated without discrimination and without regard to a patient's ability to pay for care. Fur thermore, any action that discourages patients from seeking EMCare, including, but not limited to, demanding payment before treatment or permitting debt collection and recovery activities that interfere with the provision of EMCare, is prohibited. Hospital Facilities shall also operate in accordance with all federal and state requirements for the provision of care relating to emergency medical conditions, including screening, treatment and transfer requirements under the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) and in accordance with 42 CFR 482.55 (or any successor regulation). Hospital Facilities should consult and be guided by any CommonSpirit EMTALA Policy, EMTALA regulations, and applicable Medicare/Medicaid Conditions of Participation in determining what constitutes an emergency medical condition and the processes to be followed with respect to each. Extraordinary Collection Actions (ECAs) - The Hospital Facility will not engage in ECAs against an individual prior to making a reasona ble effort to determine eligibility under this 114 Effective Date: July 1, 2022 Page 4 of 11 Financial Assistance Policy \u00a9 Copyright 2022 CommonSpirit Health. Policy. An ECA may include any of the following actions taken in an effort to obtain payment on a bill for care: Selling an individual's debt to another party except as expressly provided by federal law; and Reporting adverse information about the individual to consumer credit bureaus. ECAs do not include any lien that a Hospital Facility is entitled to assert under state law on the proceeds of a judgment or compromise owed to an individual (or his or her rep resentative) as a result of personal injuries for which the Facility provided care. Family means (using the Census Bureau definition) a group of two or more people who reside together and who are related by birth, marriage, or adoption. According to Inte rnal Revenue Service (IRS) rules, if the patient claims someone as a dependent on his or her income tax return, that person may be considered a dependent for purposes of the provision of Financial Assistance. If IRS tax documentation is not available, fami ly size will be determined by the number of dependents documented on the Financial Assistance application and verified by the Hospital Facility. Family Income is determined consistent with the IRS definition of Modified Adjusted Gross Income for the applicant and all members of the applicant's Family. In determining eligibility, CommonSpirit Hospital Organization may consider the 'monetary assets' of the patient 's Family. However, for purposes of this determination, monetary assets will not include retirement or deferred compensation plans. Federal Poverty Level Guidelines (FPL) are updated annually in the Federal Register by the United States Department of He alth and Human Services under the authority of subsection (2) of Section 9902 of Title 42 of the United States Code. Current guidelines can be referenced at http://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty -guidelines . Financial Assistance means assistance provided to patients for whom it would be a financial hardship to fully pay the expected out -of-pocket expenses for EMCare provided in a Hospital Facility and who meet the eligibility criteria for such assistance. Fina ncial Assistance is offered to insured patients to the extent allowed under the patient's insurance carrier contract. Guarantor means an individual who is legally responsible for payment of the patient's bill. Hospital Facility (or Facility) means a hea lthcare facility that is required by a state to be licensed, registered or similarly recognized as a hospital and that is operated by a CommonSpirit Hospital Organization. Medically Necessary Care means any procedure reasonably determined (by a provider) to be necessary to prevent, diagnose, correct, cure, alleviate, or avert the worsening of any condition, illness, injury or disease that endangers life, cause suffering or pain, results in illness or infirmity, threatens to cause or aggravate a handicap, or cause physical deformity or malfunction, or to improve the functioning of a malformed body member, if there is no other equally effective, more conservative or less costly course of treatment available. Medically Necessary Care does not include elective or cosmetic procedures only to improve aesthetic appeal of a normal, or normally functioning, body part. 115 Effective Date: July 1, 2022 Page 5 of 11 Financial Assistance Policy \u00a9 Copyright 2022 CommonSpirit Health. Operates a Hospital Facility - A Hospital Facility is considered to be operated either by use of its own employees or by contracting out the operatio n of the Facility to another organization. A Hospital Facility may also be operated by a CommonSpirit Hospital Organization if the CommonSpirit Hospital Organization has a capital or profits interest in an entity taxed as a partnership which directly opera tes a state licensed Hospital Facility or which indirectly operates a state licensed Hospital Facility through another entity taxed as a partnership. Presumptive Financial Assistance means the determination of eligibility for Financial Assistance that may rely on information provided by third -party vendors and other publicly available information. A determination that a patient is presumptively eligible for Financial Assistance will result in free or discounted EMCare for the period during which the indivi dual is presumptively eligible. Substantially -Related Entity means, with respect to a CommonSpirit Hospital Organization, an entity treated as a partnership for federal tax purposes in which the Hospital Organization owns a capital or profits interest, or a disregarded entity of which the Hospital Organization is the sole member or owner, that provides EMCare in a state licensed Hospital Facility, unless the provision of such care is an unrelated trade or business described in IRC Section 513 with respect to the Hospital Organization. Uninsured means an individual having no third -party coverage by a commercial third -party insurer, an ERISA plan, a Federal Health Care Program (including without limitation Medicare, Medicaid, SCHIP and TRICARE), Worker's Com pensation, or other third -party assistance to assist with meeting his or her payment obligations. Underinsured means an individual with private or public insurance coverage, for whom it would be a financial hardship to fully pay the expected out -of-pocket expenses for EMCare covered by this Policy. ELIGIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE A. Financial Assistance Available for EMCare A patient who qualifies for Financial Assistance will receive free or discounted EMCare, and as such will never be responsible for more than AGB for EMCare. Financial Assistance shall be provided to patients who m eet the eligibility requirements as described herein and have established residency within the CommonSpirit Entity Service Area as defined by the most recent Hospital Facility CHNA, unless the visit is urgent or emergent or occurs within a California Hospi tal Facility. Residents of countries outside the United States of America are not eligible for financial assistance without prior approval from the Hospital Facility Chief Financial Officer (or his or her designee), unless the visit is urgent or emergent. All scheduled services for patients who reside outside the CommonSpirit Entity Service Area require prior approval from the Hospital Facility Chief Financial Officer (or his or her designee). If an ordering provider has requested services at a Hospital Fa cility and the same service is also provided at another facility closer to the patient's residence and outside the CommonSpirit Entity Service Area, the Hospital Facility may request the ordering provider to re -evaluate the services and request the service s be performed closer to the patient's residence. B. Financial Assistance Not Available for Other than EMCare 116 Effective Date: July 1, 2022 Page 6 of 11 Financial Assistance Policy \u00a9 Copyright 2022 CommonSpirit Health. Financial Assistance is not available for care other than EMCare. In the case of care other than EMCare, no patient will be responsible for more than the net charges for such care (gross charges for such care after all deductions and insurance reimbursements have been applied). C. Amount of Financial Assistance Available Eligibility for Financial Assistance will be considered for those individuals who are Uninsured, Underinsured, ineligible for any government health care benefit program, and who are unable to pay for their care, based upon a determination of financial need in accordance with this Policy. The granting of Financial Assistance shall be based on an individualized determination of financial need, and shall not take into account any potential discriminatory factors such as age, ancestry, gender, gender identity, gender expression, race, color, national origin, sexual orientation, marital s tatus, social or immigrant status, religious affiliation, or any other basis prohibited by federal, state, or local law. Unless eligible for Presumptive Financial Assistance, the following eligibility criteria must be met in order for a patient to qualify for Financial Assistance: The patient must have a minimum account balance of ten dollars ($10.00) with the CommonSpirit Hospital Organization. Multiple account balances may be combined to reach this amount. Patients/Guarantors with balances below ten dol lars ($10.00) may contact a financial counselor to make monthly installment payment arrangements. The patient must comply with Patient Cooperation Standards as described herein. The patient must submit a completed Financial Assistance Application (FAA). D. Charity Care Up to 200% of the FPL - Any patient whose Family Income is at or below 200% of the FPL, including, without limitation, any Uninsured or Underinsured patient, is eligible to receive Financial Assistance up to a 100% discount from his or her ac count balance for eligible services provided to the patient after payment, if any, by any third -party(ies). 201% - 400% of the FPL - Any patient whose Family Income is at or above 201% but lower than 400% of the FPL, including, without limitation, any Uninsured or Underinsured patient, is eligible to receive Financial Assistance reducing his or her account balance for eligible servic es provided to the patient after payment, if any, by any third -party(ies), to an amount no more than the Hospital Facility's AGB. E. Patient Cooperation Standards A patient must cooperate with the Hospital Facility in providing the information and documenta tion necessary to determine eligibility. Such cooperation includes completing any required applications or forms. The patient is responsible for notifying the Hospital Facility of any change in financial situation that would impact the assessment of eligib ility. A patient must exhaust all other payment options, including private coverage, federal, state and local medical assistance programs, and other forms of assistance provided by third parties prior to being approved. An applicant for Financial Assista nce is responsible for applying to public programs for available coverage. He or she is also expected to pursue public or private health insurance payment options for care provided by a CommonSpirit Hospital Organization within a Hospital Facility. 117 Effective Date: July 1, 2022 Page 7 of 11 Financial Assistance Policy \u00a9 Copyright 2022 CommonSpirit Health. A pat ient's and, if applicable, any Guarantor's cooperation in applying for applicable programs and identifiable funding sources, shall be required. A Hospital Facility shall make affirmative efforts to help a patient or patient's Guarantor apply for public an d private programs, which may include coverage under a health insurance exchange, commercial health insurance, or health plan coverage purchased through COBRA. If a Hospital Facility determines that coverage under a health insurance exchange, commercial he alth insurance, or a COBRA plan is potentially available, and that a patient is not a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary, the Hospital Facility may require that the patient or Guarantor (i) provide the Hospital Facility and applicable foundation with inform ation necessary to determine the monthly premium for such patient, and (ii) cooperate with Hospital Facility and foundation staff to determine whether he or she qualifies for premium assistance, which may be offered (through designated foundation funds) fo r a limited time to assist in securing the insurance coverage mentioned above. F. Uninsured Patient Discount Non-covered services under an insurance policy and patients/Guarantors that provide evidence that no health insurance coverage exists either throug h an employer -provided program or a governmental program such as Medicare, Medicaid or other state and local program to pay for the medically necessary health care services rendered to the patient, shall be eligible for an Uninsured Patient Discount. This Discount shall not apply to cosmetic or non - medically necessary procedures and will only be available for eligible services. Each Hospital Facility shall calculate and determine the discount from gross charges available to eligible patients. The Financia l Assistance described above supersedes this Uninsured Patient Discount. If it is determined that the application of Financial Assistance will further reduce the patient's bill, Hospital Facility will reverse the Uninsured Patient Discount and apply the ap plicable adjustments under the Financial Assistance Policy. G. Self-Pay Discount For those Uninsured patients who do not qualify for any of the financial assistance discounts described in this Policy, Hospital Facilities may apply an automatic (self -pay) di scount to a patient's bill in accordance with CommonSpirit Revenue Cycle guidelines and procedures. This self -pay discount is not means -tested. THE METHOD FOR APPLYING FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE All patients must complete the CommonSpirit FAA to be considered for Financial Assistance, unless they are eligible for Presumptive Financial Assistance. The FAA is used by the Hospital Facility to make an individual assessment of financial need. To qualify for assistance, patient must provide bank or checki ng account statements evidencing the patient's available resources (those convertible to cash and unnecessary for the patient's daily living) and at least one (1) piece of supporting documentation that verifies Family Income is required to be submitted alo ng with the FAA. Supporting documentation may include, but is not limited to: Copy of the individual's most recently filed federal income tax return; Current Form W -2; 118 Effective Date: July 1, 2022 Page 8 of 11 Financial Assistance Policy \u00a9 Copyright 2022 CommonSpirit Health. Current paystubs; or Signed letter of support. The Hospital Facility may, at its discr etion, rely on evidence of eligibility other than described in the FAA or herein. Other evidentiary sources may include: External publicly available data sources that provide information on a patient/Guarantor's ability to pay; A review of patient's outstanding accounts for prior services rendered and the patient/Guarantor's payment history; Prior determinations of the patient's or Guarantor's eligibility for assistance under this Policy, if any; or Evidence obtained as a result of exploring appropriate alternative sources of payment and coverage from public and private payment programs. In the event no income is evidenced on a completed FAA, a written document is required which describes why income information is not available and how the patient or Guarantor supports basic living expenses (such as housing, food, and utilities). Financial Assistance applicants who participate in the National Health Services Corps (NHSC) Loan Repayment Program are exempt from submitting expense information. PRESUMPTIVE ELIGIBILITY CommonSpirit Hospital Organizations recognize that not all patients and Guarantors are able to complete the FAA or provide requisite documentation. Financial counselors are available at each Hospital Facility location to assist any individual seeking application assistance. For patients and Guarantors who are unable to provide required documentation, a Hospital Facility may grant Presumptive Financial Assistance based on information obtained from other resources. In particular, p resumptive eligibility may be determined on the basis of individual life circumstances that may include: Recipient of state -funded prescription programs; Homeless or one who received care from a homeless or free care clinic; Participation in Women, Infants and Children programs (WIC); Food stamp eligibility; Eligibility or referrals for other state or local assistance programs (e.g., Medicaid); Low inco me/subsidized housing is provided as a valid address; or Patient is deceased with no known spouse or known estate. This information will enable Hospital Facilities to make informed decisions on the financial needs of patients, utilizing the best estimate s available in the absence of information provided directly by the patient. A patient determined eligible for Presumptive Financial Assistance will receive free or discounted EMCare for the period during which the individual is presumptively eligible. Medicaid patients who receive non -covered medically necessary services will be considered for Presumptive Financial Assistance. Financial assistance may be approved in instances prior to the Medicaid effective date. If an individual is determined to be pres umptively eligible, a patient will be granted Financial Assistance for a period of twelve (12) months ending on the date of presumptive eligibility 119 Effective Date: July 1, 2022 Page 9 of 11 Financial Assistance Policy \u00a9 Copyright 2022 CommonSpirit Health. determination. As a result, Financial Assistance will be applied to all eligible accounts incurred for servi ces received twelve (12) months prior to the determination date. The presumptively eligible individual will not receive financial assistance for EMCare rendered after the date of determination without completion of a FAA or a new determination of presumpti ve eligibility. For patients, or their Guarantors, who are non -responsive to a Hospital Facility's application process, other sources of information may be used to make an individual assessment of financial need. This information will enable the Hospital Facility to make an informed decision on the financial need of non -responsive patients, utilizing the best estimates available in the absence of information provided directly by the patient. For the purpose of helping financially needy patients, a Hospita l Facility may use a third -party to review a patient's, or the patient's Guarantor's, information to assess financial need. This review utilizes a healthcare industry -recognized, predictive model that is based on public record databases. The model incorpor ates public record data to calculate a socio -economic and financial capability score. The model's rule set is designed to assess each patient based upon the same standards and is calibrated against historical Financial Assistance approvals by the Hospital Facility. This enables the Hospital Facility to assess whether a patient is characteristic of other patients who have historically qualified for Financial Assistance under the traditional application process. When the model is utilized, it will be deploy ed prior to bad debt assignment after all other eligibility and payment sources have been exhausted. This allows a Hospital Facility to screen all patients for Financial Assistance prior to pursuing any ECAs. The data returned from this review will constit ute adequate documentation of financial need under this Policy. In the event a patient does not qualify for presumptive eligibility, the patient may still provide requisite information and be considered under the traditional FAA process. Patient accoun ts granted presumptive eligibility status will be provided free or discounted care for eligible services for retrospective dates of service only . This decision will not constitute a state of free or discounted care as available through the traditional appl ication process. These accounts will be treated as eligible for Financial Assistance under this Policy. They will not be sent to collection, will not be subject to further collection action, and will not be included in Hospital Facility bad debt expense. Patients will not be notified to inform them of this decision. Additionally, any deductible and coinsurance amount claimed as a Medicare bad debt shall be excluded from the reporting of charity care. Presumptive screening provides a community benefit by enabling a CommonSpirit Hospital Organization to systematically identify financially needy patients, reduce administrative burdens, and provide Financial Assistance to patients and their Guarantors, some of whom may have not been responsive to the FAA proc ess. NOTIFICATION ABOUT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE Notification about the availability of Financial Assistance from CommonSpirit Hospital Organizations shall be disseminated by various means, which may include, but not be limited to: Conspicuous publication of notices in patient bills; 120 Effective Date: July 1, 2022 Page 10 of 11 Financial Assistance Policy \u00a9 Copyright 2022 CommonSpirit Health. Notices posted in emergency rooms, urgent care centers, admitting/registration departments, business offices, and at other public places as a Hospital Facility may elect; and Publication of a summary of this Policy on the Hospital Facility's website, as provided in Addendum A, and at other places within the communities served by the Hospital Facility as it may elect. Patients may obtain additional information regarding the Hospital Facility's AGB percentage and how the AGB percentages were calculated from a Hospital Facility's financial counselor as provided in Addendum A. Such notices and summary information shall include a contact number and shall be provided in English, Spanish, and other primary languages spoken by the population served by an individual Hospital Facility, as applicable. Referral of patients for Financial Assistance may be made by any member of the CommonSpirit Hospital Organization non -medical or medical staff, including physicians, nurses, fin ancial counselors, social workers, case managers, chaplains, and religious sponsors. A request for assistance may be made by the patient or a family member, close friend, or associate of the patient, subject to applicable privacy laws. CommonSpirit Hospit al Organizations will provide financial counseling to patients about their bills related to EMCare and will make the availability of such counseling known. It is the responsibility of the patient or the patient's Guarantor to schedule consultations regardi ng the availability of Financial Assistance with a financial counselor. A provider listing will be published by each CommonSpirit Hospital Facility on its website, on or before July 1, 2021, and will be updated by management periodically (but no less than quarterly) thereafter. ACTIONS IN THE EVENT OF NON -PAYMENT The actions a CommonSpirit Hospital Organization may take in the event of nonpayment with respect to each Hospital Facility are described in a separate policy, CommonSpirit Governance Poli cy Finance G -004, Billing and Collections . Members of the public may obtain a free copy of this Policy by contacting the Hospital Facility Patient Access/Admitting department, as provided in Addendum A. APPLICATION OF PROCEDURES CommonSpirit Revenue Cycle leadership is responsible for the implementation of this Policy.

For Internal Use Only. COMMONSPIRIT HEALTH GOVERNANCE POLICY SUBJECT: Billing and Collections EFFECTIVE DATE: July 1, 2022 POLICY NUMBER: Finance G -004 ORIGINAL EFFECTIVE DATE: July 1, 2021 POLICY The purpose of this Policy is to provide clear and consistent guidelines for conducting billing, collections, and recovery functions in a manner that promotes compliance with Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 501(r) and applicable collection laws and regulations, patient satisfaction, and efficiency. This Policy outlines the circumstances under which Hospital Facilities will undertake collections actions on delinquent patient accounts related to the provision of Emergency Medical Care and Medically Necessary Care (herein referred to as EMCare) and identif ies Permissible Collections Activities. This Policy describes the actions that a Hospital Facility may take to obtain payment of a bill for EMCare in the event of non - payment, including, but not limited to, any permissible collection actions. SCOPE This Policy applies to CommonSpirit Health and each of its tax -exempt Direct Affiliates1 and tax-exempt Subsidiaries2 that operate a Hospital Facility (referred to individually as a CommonSpirit Hospital Organization and collectively as CommonSpirit Hospital Organizations). It is the policy of CommonSpirit to follow the highest standards of ethics and integrity in their conduct of collections and recovery activities and to follow collections protocols for the fair treatment to all CommonSpirit Hospital Organiz ations patients at each Hospital Facility. PRINCIPLES After CommonSpirit Hospital Organization patients have received services, Hospital Facilities will bill patients/Guarantors and applicable payers accurately and in a timely manner. During this billing and collections process, staff will provide quality customer service and timely follow - up, and all outstanding accounts will be handled in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations. In addition, CommonSpirit values require that all individuals b e treated with 1 A Direct Affiliate is any corporation of which CommonSpirit Health is the sole corporate member or sole shareholder, as well as Dignity Community Care, a Colorado nonprofit corporation. 2 A Subsidiary refers to either an organization, whether nonprofit or for -profit, in which a Direct Affiliate holds the power to appoint fifty percent (50%) or more of the voting members of the governing body of such organization or holds fifty percent (50% ) or more of the voting rights in such organization (as evidenced by membership powers or securities conferring certain decision -making authority on the Direct Affiliate) or any organization in which a Subsidiary holds such power or voting rights. 123 Effective Date: July 1, 202 2 Page 2 of 10 Billing and Collections Policy \u00a9 Copyright 2022 CommonSpirit Health. For Internal Use Only. reverence and compassion. CommonSpirit has defined certain collections actions to be in conflict with CommonSpirit's organizational values and have prohibited their use at any time. APPLICATION A. This Policy applies to: All charges for EM Care provided in a Hospital Facility by a CommonSpirit Hospital Organization. All charges for EMCare provided by a physician or advanced practice clinician who is employed by a CommonSpirit Hospital Organization, to the extent such care is provided within a Hospital Facility. All charges for EMCare provided by a physician or advanc ed practice clinician who is employed by a Substantially -Related Entity that occurs within a Hospital Facility. Non-covered Medically Necessary Care provided to patients where the patient would bear responsibility for the charges, such as charges for days beyond a length of stay limit or in circumstances where the patient's benefits have been exhausted. Any collection and recovery activities conducted by the Hospital Facility or a designated supplier of billing and collections services (Designated Supplier) , or its third -party collection agents of a Hospital Organization to collect amounts owed for EMCare described above. All third -party agreements governing such collection and recovery activities must include a provision requiring compliance with this Polic y and indemnification for failures as a result of its noncompliance. This includes, but is not limited to, agreements between third - parties who subsequently sell or refer debt of the Hospital Facility. B. Coordination with other laws The provision of Financial Assistance and billing and collection of patient accounts may now or in the future be subject to additional regulation pursuant to federal, state, or local laws. Such law governs to the extent it imposes more stringent requirements than this Poli cy. In the event that a subsequently adopted state or local law directly conflicts with this Policy, the CommonSpirit Hospital Organization shall, after consultation with its local CommonSpirit Legal Team representative, CommonSpirit Revenue Cycle leaders hip and CommonSpirit Tax leadership, be permitted to adopt an addendum to this Policy before the next policy review cycle, with such minimal changes to this Policy as are necessary to achieve compliance with any applicable laws. PRINCIPLES Through the use of billing statements, written correspondence, and phone calls, CommonSpirit Hospital Organizations will make diligent efforts to inform patients/Guarantors of their financial responsibilities and available Financial Assistance options, as well as foll ow up with patients/Guarantors regarding outstanding accounts. As Catholic health care providers, CommonSpirit Hospital Organizations are called to meet the needs of patients and others who seek care, regardless of their financial abilities to pay for the services provided. Finally, CommonSpirit Hospital Organizations are designated as charitable (i.e., tax -exempt) organizations under IRC Section 501(c)(3). Pursuant to IRC Section 501(r), among other 124 Effective Date: July 1, 202 2 Page 3 of 10 Billing and Collections Policy \u00a9 Copyright 2022 CommonSpirit Health. For Internal Use Only. things, in order to remain tax -exempt, each CommonSpir it Hospital Organization must do the following with respect to patients receiving EMCare at any Hospital Facility: Limit the amounts individuals eligible for Financial Assistance are charged for EMCare to not more than the Amounts Generally Billed (AGB) to individuals who have insurance covering such Care; Bill less than gross charges to individuals eligible for Financial Assistance for all other medical care; and Not engage in Extraordinary Collections Actions before the Hospital Facility has m ade reasonable efforts to determine whether the individual is eligible for assistance under CommonSpirit Governance Policy Finance G -003, Financial Assistance. DEFINITIONS Amounts Generally Billed (AGB) means the maximum charge a patient who is eligible for Financial Assistance under this Financial Assistance Policy is personally responsible for paying, after all deductions and discounts (including discounts available under this Policy) have been applied and less any amounts reimbursed by insurers. No pat ient eligible for Financial Assistance will be charged more than the AGB for EMCare provided to the patient. CommonSpirit calculates the AGB on a Facility -by-Facility basis using the \"lookback\" method by multiplying the \"Gross Charges\" for any EMCare that it provides by AGB percentages, which are based upon past claims allowed under Medicare and private insurance as set forth in federal law. \"Gross Charges\" for these purposes means the amount listed on each Hospital Facility's chargemaster for each EMCare s ervice. Application Period means the time provided to patients by the CommonSpirit Hospital Organization to complete the Financial Assistance application. It expires on the later of (i) 365 days from the patient's discharge from the Hospital Facility or t he date of the patient's EMCare, or (ii) 240 days from the date of the initial post -discharge bill for the EMCare received at a Hospital Facility. Emergency Medical Care, EMTALA - Any patient seeking care for an emergency medical condition within the mean ing of Section 1867 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395dd) at a Hospital Facility shall be treated without discrimination and without regard to a patient's ability to pay for care. Furthermore, any action that discourages patients from seeking EMCar e, including, but not limited to, demanding payment before treatment or permitting debt collection and recovery activities that interfere with the provision of EMCare, is prohibited. Hospital Facilities shall also operate in accordance with all federal and state requirements for the provision of care relating to emergency medical conditions, including screening, treatment and transfer requirements under the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) and in accordance with 42 CFR 482.55 (or a ny successor regulation). Hospital Facilities should consult and be guided by any CommonSpirit EMTALA Policy, EMTALA regulations, and applicable Medicare/Medicaid Conditions of Participation in determining what constitutes an emergency medical condition an d the processes to be followed with respect to each. Extraordinary Collection Actions (ECAs) - The Hospital Facility will not engage in ECAs against an individual prior to making a reasonable effort to determine eligibility under the Hospital Facility's FAP. An ECA may include any of the following actions taken in an effort to obtain payment on a bill for care: 125 Effective Date: July 1, 202 2 Page 4 of 10 Billing and Collections Policy \u00a9 Copyright 2022 CommonSpirit Health. For Internal Use Only. Selling an individual's debt to another party except as expressly provided by federal law; and Reporting adverse information about the individua l to consumer credit bureaus. ECAs do not include any lien that a Hospital Facility is entitled to assert under state law on the proceeds of a judgment, settlement, or compromise owed to an individual (or his or her representative) as a result of personal injuries for which the Facility provided care. Financial Assistance means assistance provided to patients for whom it would be a financial hardship to fully pay the expected out -of-pocket expenses for EMCare provided in a Hospital Facility and who meet the eligibility criteria for such assistance. Financial Assistance is offered to insured patients to the extent allowed under the patient's insurance carrier contract. Financial Assistance Policy (FAP) means CommonSpirit Governance Policy Finance G - 003, Financial Assistance , which describes CommonSpirit's Financial Assistance program, including the criteria patients/Guarantors must meet in order to be eligible for Financial Assistance as well as the process by which individuals may apply for Financial Assi stance. Guarantor means an individual who is legally responsible for payment of the patient's bill. Hospital Facility (or Facility) means a healthcare facility that is required by a state to be licensed, registered, or similarly recognized as a hospital and that is operated by a CommonSpirit Hospital Organization. In reference to the performance of billing and collection activities, the term \"Hospital Facility\" may also include a Designated Supplier. Medically Necessary Care means any procedur e reasonably determined (by a provider) to be necessary to prevent, diagnose, correct, cure, alleviate, or avert the worsening of any condition, illness, injury or disease that endangers life, cause suffering or pain, results in illness or infirmity, threa tens to cause or aggravate a handicap, or cause physical deformity or malfunction, or to improve the functioning of a malformed body member, if there is no other equally effective, more conservative or less costly course of treatment available. Medically Necessary Care does not include elective or cosmetic procedures only to improve aesthetic appeal of a normal, or normally functioning, body part. Notification Period means the 120 -day period beginning on the date the Hospital Facility provides the first po st-discharge billing statement for the EMCare. A Facility will refrain from engaging in an ECA during the Notification Period, unless reasonable efforts have been made to determine a patient is eligible for Financial Assistance. Operates a Hospital Facili ty - A Hospital Facility is considered to be operated either by use of its own employees or by contracting out the operation of the Facility to another organization. A Hospital Facility may also be operated by a CommonSpirit Hospital Organization if the CommonSpirit Hospital Organization has a capital or profits interest in an entity taxed as a partnership which directly operates a state licensed Hospital Facility or which indirectly operates a state licensed Hospital Facility through another entity taxed a s a partnership. Presumptive Financial Assistance means the determination of eligibility for Financial Assistance that may rely on information provided by third -party vendors and other publicly available information. A determination that a patient is pres umptively eligible for Financial Assistance will result in free or discounted EMCare for the period during which the individual 126 Effective Date: July 1, 202 2 Page 5 of 10 Billing and Collections Policy \u00a9 Copyright 2022 CommonSpirit Health. For Internal Use Only. is presumptively eligible. See also Presumptive Eligibility in CommonSpirit Governance Policy Finance G -003, Financial Assistanc e. Substantially -Related Entity means, with respect to a CommonSpirit Hospital Organization, an entity treated as a partnership for federal tax purposes in which the Hospital Organization owns a capital or profits interest, or a disregarded entity of which the Hospital Organization is the sole member or owner, that provides EMCare in a state licensed Hospital Facility, unless the provision of such care is an unrelated trade or business described in IRC Section 513 with respect to the Hospital Organization. Suspending ECAs when a Financi al Assistance Application (FAA) is Submitted means a Facility (or other authorized party) does not initiate an ECA, or take further action on any previously initiated ECAs, to obtain payment for the EMCare until either: The Facility has determined whether the individual is FAP -eligible based on a complete FAP application and met the reasonable efforts requirement, as defined herein, with respect to a completed FAA; or In the case of an incomplete FAA, the individual has failed to respond to requests for additional information or documentation within a reasonable period of time (thirty (30) days) given to respond to such requests. Uninsured means an individual having no third -party coverage by a commercial third -party insurer, an ERISA plan, a Federal Health Care Program (including without limitation Medicare, Medicaid, SCHIP, and TRICARE), Worker's Compensation, or other third -party assistance to assist with meeting his or her payment obligations. Underinsured means an individual with private or public ins urance coverage, for whom it would be a financial hardship to fully pay the expected out -of-pocket expenses for EMCare covered by this Policy. BILLING PRACTICES CommonSpirit Hospital Organizations will follow standard procedures in collecting on accounts related to EMCare provided at a CommonSpirit Hospital Facility as follows: A. Insurance Billing For all insured patients, Hospital Facilities will bill applicabl e third -party payers (based on information provided or verified by the patient/Guarantor, or appropriately verified from other sources) in a timely manner. If an otherwise valid claim is denied (or not processed) by the payer due to an error by a Hospital Facility, the Hospital Facility will not bill the patient for any amount in excess of what the patient would have owed had the payer paid the claim. If an otherwise valid claim is denied (or not processed) by a payer due to factors outside of the Hospital Facility's control, staff will follow up with the payer and patient as appropriate to facilitate resolution of the claim. If resolution does not occur after reasonable follow -up efforts, Hospital Facilities may bill the patient or take other actions consis tent with payer contracts. B. Patient Billing 127 Effective Date: July 1, 202 2 Page 6 of 10 Billing and Collections Policy \u00a9 Copyright 2022 CommonSpirit Health. For Internal Use Only. All patients/Guarantors will be billed directly and timely and receive a statement as part of the Hospital Facility's normal billing process. For insured patients, after claims have been processed by all availa ble third -party payers, Hospital Facilities will bill patients/Guarantors in a timely manner for their respective liability amounts as determined by their insurance benefits. All patients/Guarantors may at any time request, and the Hospital Facility will provide, an itemized statement for their accounts. If a patient disputes his or her account and requests documentation regarding the bill, staff will provide the requested documentation in writing within ten (10) days (if possible) and will h old the account for at least thirty (30) days before referring the account for collection. Hospital Facilities shall approve payment plan arrangements for patients/Guarantors who indicate they may have difficulty paying their balance in a single installme nt. Revenue Cycle leadership has the authority to make exceptions to this provision on a case -by-case basis for special circumstances (in accordance with operating procedures). Hospital Facilities are not required to accept patient -initiated payment arrang ements and may refer accounts to a third -party collection agency as outlined below if the patient defaults on an established payment plan. C. Collection Practices Any collection activities conducted by the Facility, a Designated Supplier, or its third - party collection agents will be in conformance with all federal and state laws governing debt collection practices. All patients/Guarantors will have the opportunity to contact the Hospital Facility regarding Financial Assistance, payment plan options, and ot her applicable programs that may be available with respect to their accounts, as provided in Addendum A. o A Hospital Facility's FAP is available free of charge. o Individuals with questions regarding a Hospital Facility's FAP may contact the financial counse ling office by phone or in person. In compliance with relevant state and federal laws, and in accordance with the provisions outlined in this Policy, Hospital Facilities may engage in collection activities, including Permissible ECAs, to collect outstandi ng patient balances. o General collection activities may include phone calls, statements, and other reasonable efforts in accordance with standard industry practices. o Patient balances may be referred to a third -party for collection at the discretion of the Facility and in compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local non -discrimination practices. The Facility will maintain ownership of any debt referred to debt collection agencies, and patient accounts will be referred for collection only with the following caveats: There is a reasonable basis to believe the patient owes the debt. All third -party payers identified by the patient/Guarantor in a prompt and ti mely manner that have been properly billed, and the remaining debt is the financial responsibility of the patient. Hospital Facilities shall not bill a patient for any amount the insurance company or a third-party is obligated to pay. Hospital Facilities will not refer accounts for collection while a claim on the account is pending payment from a third -party payer. However, claims which remain in \"pending\" status with a third -party payer for an unreasonable length of time despite efforts to facilitate reso lution may be re -classified as \"denied.\" 128 Effective Date: July 1, 202 2 Page 7 of 10 Billing and Collections Policy \u00a9 Copyright 2022 CommonSpirit Health. For Internal Use Only. Hospital Facilities will not refer accounts for collection when the insurance claim was denied due to a Hospital Facility error. However, a Hospital Facility may still refer the patient liability portion of such cl aims for collection if unpaid. Hospital Facilities will not refer accounts for collection where the patient has initially applied for Financial Assistance, and the Hospital Facility has not yet made reasonable efforts (as defined below) with respect to the account. Upon receipt of a notice of Bankruptcy Discharge, CommonSpirit Hospital Organizations will cease all collection attempts, including assignment to a collection agency. The patient/debtor will not be contacted by any method, including phone calls, letters, or statements after receipt of the notification. All communication, if necessary, must occur with the trustee or the attorney assigned to the case. o No Facility shall send any unpaid self -pay account to a third -party collection agent as long as the patient or Guarantor is engaged in Patient Cooperation Standards, as defined in CommonSpirit Governance Policy Finance G -003, Financial Assistance . REASONABLE EFFORTS AND EXTRAORDINARY COLLECTION ACTIONS Before engaging in ECAs to obtain payment for EMCare, Hospital Facilities must make reasonable efforts to determine whether an individual is eligible for Financial Assistance. In no event will an ECA be initiated prior to 120 days (or longer, if required by applicable law) from the date the Facility p rovides the first post -discharge billing statement (i.e., during the Notification Period) unless all reasonable efforts have been made. The following scenarios describe the reasonable efforts that a Facility must take before engaging in ECAs. A. Engaging i n ECAs - Notification Requirement With respect to any EMCare provided in the Facility, a patient must be notified about the FAP as described herein, prior to initiating an ECA. The notification requirement is as follows: o Notification Letter - The Hospital Facility will notify a patient about the FAP by providing the individual with a written notice (Notification Letter) at least thirty (30) days prior to initiating an ECA. The Notification Letter must: Include a plain lang uage summary of the FAP; Indicate Financial Assistance is available for eligible individuals; and Identify the ECA(s) that the Hospital Facility (or other authorized party) intends to initiate to obtain payment for the EMCare if the amount due is not paid or an FAA is not submitted before a specified deadline, which is no earlier than the last day of the Application Period. o Oral Notification - In conjunction with the provision of the Notification Letter, the Hospital Facility will attempt to orally notify the patient about how to obtain assistance under the FAP during the registration process, using the most current telephone number provided by the patient. This attempt will be documented contemporaneously. o Notification in the Event of Multiple Episodes of Care - The Hospital Facility may satisfy this notification requirement simultaneously for multiple episodes of EMCare and notify the individual about the ECAs the Facility intends to initiate to obtain payment for multiple outstanding bills for EMCare. H owever, if a Facility aggregates an individual's outstanding bills for multiple episodes of EMCare before initiating one or more ECAs to obtain payment for those bills, it will have not have made reasonable efforts to determine whether the individual is FA P-eligible unless it refrains from initiating the ECA(s) until 120 days after the first post - discharge billing statement for the most recent episode of EMCare included in the aggregation. 129 Effective Date: July 1, 202 2 Page 8 of 10 Billing and Collections Policy \u00a9 Copyright 2022 CommonSpirit Health. For Internal Use Only. B. Reasonable Efforts when a Patient Submits an Incomplete FAA The H ospital Facility will suspend any ECAs already initiated against the patient/Guarantor until Financial Assistance eligibility has been determined. The Hospital Facility will provide a written notification to the patient with a list of required documentatio n the patient or Guarantor must provide to consider the FAA complete and give the patient thirty (30) days to provide the necessary information. The notification will include the contact information, including telephone number and physical location of the Facility or department within the Facility that can provide information about and assist with the preparation of the FAP. C. Reasonable Efforts when a Completed FAA Is Submitted If a patient submits a completed FAA during the Application Period, the Hospital Facility must: o Suspend any ECAs to obtain payment for the EMCare. o Make a determination as to whether the individual is FAP -eligible for the EMCare and notify the individual i n writing of this eligibility determination (including, if applicable, the assistance for which the individual is eligible) and the basis for this determination. o If the Hospital Facility determines the individual is FAP -eligible for the EMCare, the Hospita l Facility must do the following: Refund the individual any amount he or she has paid for the EMCare (whether to the Hospital Facility or any other party to whom the Hospital Facility has referred or sold the individual's debt for the EMCare) that exceeds the amount he or she is determined to be personally responsible for paying as a FAP -eligible individual. Take all reasonably available measures to reverse any ECA, including the removal of any adverse information that was reported to a consumer reporting a gency or credit bureau from the individual's credit report. o If the Hospital Facility determines the individual is not FAP -eligible for the EMCare, the Facility will have made reasonable efforts and may engage in the Permissible ECAs. D. Reasonable Efforts w hen No FAA Is Submitted within ninety (90) days after the First Post -Discharge Billing Statement for the Most Recent Episode of EMCare The Facility will issue the Notification Letter as described under Reasonable Efforts - Engaging in ECAs - Notification Requirement. If no FAA is received within thirty (30) days after the Notification Letter has been sent, the requirement to engage in reasonable efforts to determine FAP -eligibility will have been satisfied. Thus, the Hospital Facility may enga ge in ECAs that are permitted under this Policy beginning 120 days after the first post -discharge billing statement. Waiver - Under no circumstances will a Hospital Facility accept from any individual a waiver, whether oral or written, that an individual does not wish to apply for Financial Assistance, for the purpose of satisfying the requirements to engage in reasonable efforts described in this Policy. E. Permissible Extraordinary Collections Actions 130 Effective Date: July 1, 202 2 Page 9 of 10 Billing and Collections Policy \u00a9 Copyright 2022 CommonSpirit Health. For Internal Use Only. After making reasonable efforts, which includes the no tification requirement, to determine Financial Assistance eligibility as outlined above, a Hospital Facility (or other authorized party) may engage in the following ECAs to obtain payment for EMCare: o Selling an individual's debt to another party except as expressly provided by federal law; and o Reporting adverse information about the individual to consumer credit bureaus. A Hospital Facility will refrain from ECAs against a patient if he or she provides documentation that he or she has applied for health care coverage under Medicaid, or other publicly - sponsored healthcare programs, unless or until the individual's eligibility for such programs has been determined and any available coverage from third parties for the EMCare has been billed and processed. F. Reasonable Efforts - Third -Party Agreements With respect to any sale or referral of an individual's debt related to EMCare to another party (except for those debt sales not considered an ECA as described in the Internal Revenue Service Treasury Regulations ) the Hospital Facility will enter into and, to the extent applicable, enforce a legally binding written agreement with the party. To meet the requirement to engage in reasonable efforts to determine an individual's FAP -eligibility, these agreements must, at a minimum, include the following provisions: o If the individual submits an FAA (whether complete or incomplete) after the referral or sale of the debt but before the end of the Application Period, the party will Suspend ECAs to obtain payment for the EMCare. o If the individual submits an FAA (whether complete or incomplete) after the referral or sale of the debt but before the end of the Application Period and is determined to be FAP - eligible for the EMCare, the party will do the following in a timely m anner: Adhere to procedures specified in the agreement and this Policy so that the individual does not pay, and has no obligation to pay, the party and the Hospital Facility together more than he or she is required to pay for the EMCare as a FAP -eligible i ndividual. If applicable, and if the party (rather than the Hospital Facility) has the authority to do so, take all reasonably available measures to reverse any ECA (other than the sale of a debt) taken against the individual. o If the third -party contractor refers or sells the debt to a subsequent party (the fourth party) during the Application Period, the third -party will obtain a written agreement from that subsequent party including all the elements described under this section. o The third -party contractor must make reasonable attempts to work with a patient with unpaid bills to resolve his/her account. Aggressive or unethical collection practices are not tolerated. G. Reasonable Efforts - Providing Documents Electronically A Hospital Facility may provide a ny written notice or communication described herein electronically (for example, by email) to any individual who indicates he or she prefers to receive the written notice or communication electronically. FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE DOCUMENTATION A. Processing Requests 131 Effective Date: July 1, 202 2 Page 10 of 10 Billing and Collections Policy \u00a9 Copyright 2022 CommonSpirit Health. For Internal Use Only. CommonSpirit's values of human dignity and stewardship shall be reflected in the application process, financial need determination, and granting of assistance. Requests for Financial Assistance shall be processed promptly, and Hospital Facilitie s shall notify the patient or applicant in writing within thirty (30) to sixty (60) days of receipt of a completed application. A Hospital Facility will not make a determination of eligibility on information it has reason to believe is false or unreliable or obtained through the use of coercive practices.

Basis for Opinion We conducted our audit s in accordance with audit ing standards generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAS). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor 's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of CommonSpirit and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audits. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United Sta tes of America, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financ ial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about CommonSpirit 's ability to continue as a going concern for one year after the date that the financial statements are issued . Auditor's Responsibilit ies for the Audit of the Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor 's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS will always detect a materia l misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or Ernst & Young LLP Suite 1700 18101 Von Karman ey.com A member firm of Ernst & Young Global Limited 2209 -4095816 2 the override of intern al control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements. In performing an audit in accordan ce with GAAS, we: Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit pro cedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of CommonSpirit 's internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements. Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that r aise substantial doubt about CommonSpirit 's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control -related matters that we identified during the audit. Other Information Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the Management Discussion and Analysis o f Financial Condition and Results of Operations but does not include the financial statements and our auditor 's report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information, and we do not express an opinion or any form of as surance thereon. In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and consider whether a material inconsistency exists between the other information and the financial statements, or the other inf ormation otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work performed, we conclude that an uncorrected material misstatement of the other information exists, we are required to describe it in our report.

ORGANIZATION CommonSpirit Health is a Colorado nonprofit public benefit cor poration exempt from federal and state income taxes. CommonSpirit Health was c reated by the alignment of Cath olic Health Initiatives (\"CHI\") and Dignity Health in February 2019. CommonSpirit Health is a Catholic heal th care system sponsored by the public juridic person, Catholic Health Care Federation (\"CHCF\"). CommonSpirit Health owns and operates health care facilities i n 21 states and is the sole corporate member (parent corporation) of other primarily nonprofit corporations that are exempt from federal and state income taxes. As of June 30, 2022, CommonSpirit Health is comprised of approx imately 2,200 care sites, consisting of 142 hospitals, including academic health centers, major teaching ho spitals, and critical access facilities, community health services organizations, accredited nursing colleges, hom e health agencies, living communities, a medical foundation and other affiliated medical groups, and other facil ities and services that span the inpatient and outpatient continuum of care. CommonSpirit Health also has offs hore and onshore captive insurance companies. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include Comm onSpirit Health and its direct affiliates and subsidiaries (together, \"CommonSpirit\"). CommonSpirit Health and substantially all of its direct affili ates and subsidiaries have been granted exemptions from federal income tax as charitable organizations under Secti on 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation - The accompanying consolidated f inancial statements of Common Spirit were prepared in accordance with accounting princi ples generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\") and include the accounts of all wholly-owned affiliates and affilia tes over which CommonSpirit exercises control or has a controlling financial interest, after elimination of inte rcompany transactions and balances. Reclassification - In the year ended June 30, 2022, CommonSpirit reclassified asse ts and liabilities previously held for sale, as ministries in North Dakota and Minnesota no l onger met the requirements as held for sale. The assets and liabilities were classified as held for sale, within other current assets and other accrued liabilities - current, respectively, in the a udited consolidated balance shee t as of June 30, 2021, but have been reclassified for all periods presented to the respective financial statement lin e items in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Additional depreciation expense related to the recl assification was recorded in the year ended June 30, 2022, and is immaterial to the consolidated financial state ments. 10 The adjusted balances as of June 30, 2021, in the consolidated financial statement presentation for applicable lines, are included below as a result of the held for sale recl assification above (in millions): Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U .S. GAAP requir es management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amou nts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. CommonSpirit considers cr itical accounting policies to be those that require more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements, including the following: recognition of net patient revenue, which includes c ontractual discounts and adjustments; price concessions and charity care; fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities in business combinations; recorded values of depreciable and amortizable assets, investme nts and goodwill; reserves for self-insured workers' compensation and professional and general liabilities; contingent liabilities; and assumptions for measurement of pension and other postretirement benefit liabili ties. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that it believes are r easonable under the particular circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash and liquid marketable securities with an original mat urity of three months or less. Inventories - Inventories, primarily consisting of pharmacy drugs and medic al and surgical supplies, are stated at the lower of cost or net rea lizable value, determined using the first-in, first-out method. Inventories are recorded in other current assets in the a ccompanying consolidated balanc e sheets. Broker Receivables and Payables for Unsettled Investment Trades - CommonSpirit accounts for its investments on a trade date basis. Amounts due to/from brokers for investme nt activity represent transactions that have been initiated prior to the consolidated balance sheet date, but are formally settled subsequent to the consolidated balance sheet date. These balances are recorded within other cu rrent assets and other accr ued liabilities - current, respectively. See No tes 6 and 12. Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale - Assets and liabilities held for sale represent assets and liabi lities that are expected to be sold within one year. A group of assets and liab ilities expected to be sold within one year is classified as held for sale if i t meets certain criteria. The a ssets and liabilities held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying value or fair value less cost to sell. Such v aluations include estimates of fair values generally based upon firm offers, discounted cash flows and incremental d irect costs to transact a sale (Level 2 and Level As Originally As Presented Reclassifications Adjusted Other current assets 2,712 $ (358) $ 2,354 $ Long-term investments 19,480 17 Property and equipm ent, net 16,002 272 16,274 Right-of-use operating lease assets 1,863 29 1,892 Ownership interests in health-related activitites 3,107 34 3,141 Other long-term assets, net 1,785 6 1,791 Total assets subject to reclassification 44,949 $ - $ 44,949 $ Other accrued liabilities - current 2,984 $ (53) $ 2,931 $ Operating lease liabilitites 1,750 51 1,801 Other accrued liabilities - long-term 1,017 1 1,018 Long-term debt, net of current portion 14,540 1 14,541 Total liabilities subject to reclassification 20,291 $ - $ 20,291 $ 11 3 inputs). These balances are recorded within other current ass ets and other accrued liabilities - current, respectively. See No tes 3, 6 and 12. Investments and Investment Income - Short-term investments consist of investments with an origin al maturity of more than three months up to one year. Long-term investments consist of investments with original maturities greater than one year. The CommonSpirit Board of Stewardship Trustees Investment Commi ttee establishes guidelines for investment decisions. Within those guidelines, CommonSpirit invests in equ ity and debt securities which are measured at fair value and are classified as trad ing securities. Accordingly, un realized gains and losses on marketable securities are recorded within excess (defic it) of revenues over expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and changes in net assets, and cash flows from the p urchases and sales of marketable securities are reported as a component of oper ating activities in the accompan ying consolidated statements of cash flows. CommonSpirit also invests in alternative investments through li mited partnerships. Alternative investments are comprised of private equity, real estate, hedge fund and other investment vehicles. C ommonSpirit receives a proportionate share of the investment gains and losses of the p artnerships. The limited partnerships generally contract with managers who have full discretionary authority ov er the investment decisions, within CommonSpirit's guidelines. These alternative investment vehicle s invest in equity securities, fixed income securities, currencies, real estate, commodities, and derivativ es. CommonSpirit accounts for its own ership interests in these alte rnative investments under the equity method, the value of which is based on the net asset value (\"NAV\") practica l expedient and is determined using investment valuations provided by the external investment managers, fund m anagers or gener al partners. Alternative investments generally are not marketable, and many alternative investments have underlying investments that may not have quoted market values. The estimat ed value of such investments is subject to uncertainty and could differ had a ready market existed. Such d ifferences could be material. CommonSpirit's risk is limited to its capital investment in each investment and cap ital call commitments, as discussed in Note 8. Investment income or loss is included in excess (deficit) of re venues over expenses unless the income or loss is restricted by donor or law. Income earned on tax-exempt borrowi ngs for specific construction projects is offset against interest expense capita lized for such projects during c onstruction. Also recorded in investments are assets limited as to use set a side by CommonSpirit for future long-term purposes, including amounts held by trustees under bond indenture agreeme nts, funds set aside for self-insurance programs, amounts contributed by donors with stipulated restrictions, and amounts held for mission and ministry purposes. Liquidity - Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, patient an d other accounts receivable, broker receivables, and provider fee receivables are the financial ass ets available to meet exp ected expenditure needs within the next year. Additionally, although intended to satisf y long-term obligations, management estimates that approximately 80.7% of the CommonSpirit Health Operating Invest ment Pool, LLC (\"CSH OIP\"), as stated at June 30, 2022, could be utilized within the next year, if neede d. CommonSpirit also has credit facility programs, as described in Note 13, available to meet unanticipated liquid ity needs. Deferred Financing Costs and Original Issu e Discounts/Premiums on Bond Indebtedness - CommonSpirit amortizes deferred financing costs and original issue discounts /premiums on bond indebtedness over the estimated average period the related bonds will be outstanding, which approximates the effective interest method. Both deferred financing costs and original issue discounts/prem iums are recorded with the related debt. Property and Equipment - Property and equipment are stated at cost if purchased and a t fair market value upon receipt if acquired through a bus iness combination or donated, or upon the date of impairment, if impaired. Depreciation of property and equipment is recorded using the st raight-line method. Amortization of finance lease assets is included in depreciati on expense. Estimated useful li ves by major classifica tion are as follows: L a n d i m p r o v e m e n t s 2 t o 4 0 y e a r s B u i l d i n g s a n d i m p r o v e m e n t s 5 t o 6 5 y e a r s E q u i p m e n t 3 t o 4 0 y e a r s S o f t w a r e 3 t o 1 0 y e a r s 12 Asset Impairment - CommonSpirit routinely evaluates the carrying value of its l ong-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the c arrying amount of the asset, or related group of assets, may not be recoverable from estimated future undiscount ed cash flows generated by the underlying tangible assets. When the carrying value of an asset exceeds th e estimated recoverability, an asset impairment charge is recognized. The impairment tests are based on financi al projections prepared by management that incorporate anticipated results from programs and initiatives b eing implemented and mar ket value assessments of the assets. If these projections are not met, or if negative trends occur that impact the future outlook, the value of the long-lived assets may be impaired. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually on various dates and when an event or circumstance indicates the value of the reporting unit or intangible asset may be impaired. CommonSpirit uses the income and market approaches to estimate the fair valu e of its reporting units and uses the income approach to estimate the fair value of its indefinite-lived int angible assets. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge is recognized. See Note 11. Fair Value of Financial Instruments - The carrying amounts reported in the accompanying consolidat ed balance sheets for assets and liabilities, such as cash and cash equiva lents, patient accounts receivable, interests in unconsolidated foundations, excess insurance receivables, commu nity investment loans, broker receivables and payables on unsettled investment trades, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximate fair value due to the nature of these items. The fai r value of investments is dis closed in Note 8. Derivative Instruments - CommonSpirit utilizes derivative arrangements to manage inte rest costs and the risk associated with changing interest rates. CommonSpirit records d erivative instruments on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as e ither an asset or liability mea sured at its fair valu e. See Notes 8 and 14. CommonSpirit does not have derivative instruments that are desi gnated as hedges. Interest cost and changes in fair value of derivative instruments are included in change in fair value and cash payments of interest rate swaps in nonoperating income, net, in the accompanying consolidated s tatements of operations and changes in net assets. Ownership Interests in Health-Related Activities - Generally, when the ownership interest in a health-related activity is more than 50% and CommonSpirit has a controlling in terest, the ownership interest is consolidated, and a noncontrolling interest is recorded in net assets without donor restrictions. When the ownership interest is at least 20%, but not more than 50%, or CommonSpirit has the ab ility to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the investee, it is account ed for under the equity method, and the income or loss is reflected in revenue from health-related activities, ne t. Ownership interests for which CommonSpirit's ownership is less than 20% or for which CommonSpirit does not h ave the ability to exercise significant influence are measured at cost. See Note 10. Self-Insurance Plans - The liability for self-insured reserves and claims represent s the estimated ultimate net cost of all reported and unreported losses incurred through Jun e 30. Actuarial estimates of uninsured losses at June 30, 2022 and 2021, have be en accrued as liabilities and in clude an actuarial estimate for claims incurred but not reported (\"IBNR\"). CommonSpirit has insurance coverage in p lace for amounts in excess of the self-insured retention for workers' compensation and professional and genera l liabilities. The current and long-term portions of these liabilities are reflected accordingly in other accrued liabilities - current and other accrued liabilities - long-term in the acco mpanying consolidated balance sheets. CommonSpirit is also self-insured for certain employee medical benefits. The liability for IBNR claims for these benefits is included in other accrued liabilities - current in the accompanying conso lidated balance sheets. Patient Accounts Receivable and Net Patient Revenue - Patient service revenue is reported at the amounts that reflect the consideration CommonSpirit expects to be paid in ex change for providing patient care. These amounts are due from patients, third-party payors (including health ins urers and government programs), and others, and include consideration for retroactive revenue adjustments due t o settlement of audits and reviews. Generally, performance obligatio ns for patients receiving inpatient acute care services and outpatient services are recognized over time as services are provided. Net patient revenue is prim arily comprised of hospital and physician services. Performance obligations are generally satisfied over a period o f less than one year. As such, CommonSpirit has elected to apply the optional ex emption provided in Financial A ccounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2015-14, Revenue From Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) , and 13 is not required to disclose the aggregate amount of the transac tion price allocated to perf ormance obligations that are unsatisfied or partially unsa tisfied at the end of the repo rting period. CommonSpirit determines the transaction price based on standard charges for services provided, reduced by contractual adjustments provided to third-party payors, discoun ts provided to uninsured and underinsured patients in accordance with CommonSpirit's financial assistance policy, and implicit price concessions provided to uninsured and underinsured patients. CommonSpirit determines it s estimates of contractual adjustments and discounts based on contractual agreements, its discount policy, and historical experience. CommonSpirit determines its estimate of implicit price concessions based on its historical collection experience with these classes of patients using a portfolio approach as a practical e xpedient to account for patie nt contracts as collective groups rather than individually. CommonSpirit relies on the res ults of detailed reviews of historical write-offs and collections in estimating the collectability of accounts re ceivable. Updates to the hindsight analysis are performed at least quarterly using primarily a rolling eighteen -month collection history and write-off data. Subsequent changes to estimates o f the transaction price are ge nerally recorded as adjustments to net patient revenue in the period of the change. Subsequent changes that are determined to be the result of an a dverse change in a third-party payor's ability to pay are recorded as bad debt expense in purchased services and other in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and cha nges in net assets. Bad debt ex pense for 2022 and 2021 was not significant. Agreements with third-party payors typically provide for paymen ts at amounts less than established charges. A summary of the payment arrangements included in net patient rev enue follows: Medicare: Payments for inpatient services are generally made on a prospectively determined rate based on clinical diagnosis. Certain facilities receive cost-based reimb ursement. Hospital outpatient services are generally paid based on prospectively determined rates. Physici an services are paid based upon established fee schedules. Medicaid: Payments for inpatient services are generally made on a prospectively determined rate based on clinical diagnosis or on a per case or per diem basis. Hospital outpatient services and physician services are paid based upon established fee schedules, a cost basis reimbur sement methodology, or discounts from established charges. Commercial: Payments for inpatient and outpatient services prov ided to patients covered under commercial insurance policies are paid using a variety of payment methodol ogies, including per diem and case rates. Self-Pay and Other: Payment agreements with uninsured or underi nsured patients, along with other responsible entities, including institutions, other hospitals a nd other government payors, are based on a variety of payment methodologies. Net patient revenue includes estimated settlements under paymen t agreements with third-party payors. Settlements with third-party payors are accrued on an estimated basis in the period in which the related services are rendered and adjusted in future periods as final settlement s are determined. These settlements are estimated and evaluated based on the terms of the payment agreement with the payor, correspondence from the payor, and historical settlement activity. Premium Revenue - CommonSpirit has at-risk agr eements with various payors to p medical to enrollees. Under these agreemen ts, CommonSpirit receives monthl y payments based on th e number of enrollees, regardless of services actually performed by CommonSpirit. Comm onSpirit accrues costs when services are rendered under these contracts, including estimates of IBNR cla ims and amounts receivable/payable under risk- sharing arrangements. The IBNR accrual includes an estimate of the costs of services for which CommonSpirit is responsible, including out-of-network services, and is recor ded in other accrued liabilities - current. Financial Assistance (Charity Care) - Charity care is free or disco unted health services provided t o persons who cannot afford to pay and who meet CommonSpirit's criteria for f inancial assistance. The amount of services written off as charity quantified at customary charges was $2.0 billion for 2022 and 2021. CommonSpirit estimates the cost of charity car e by calculating a ratio of co st to usual and customary charges and applying that ratio to the usual and customary uncompensated charges associat ed with providing care to patients who qualify for charity care. This amount is not included in net patient re venue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and changes in net assets. The estimated cost of charity care associated with write-offs in 2022 and 2021 was $473 million and $507 million, respectively. See Note 20. 14 Other Operating Revenue - Other operating revenue includes grant revenues, including f unds received from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Eco nomic Security Act (\"CARES PRF\" ), American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (\"ARP Rural\"), retail pharmacy revenues, management services revenues , rental revenues, cafeteria revenues, certain contributions released from restri ctions, gains on sales of ass ets and joint venture interests, and other nonpatient care revenues. See Note 4. Contributions and Net Assets With Donor Restrictions - Gifts are reported as net assets with donor restrictions if they are received with donor stipulations that limit the use of the donated assets. When a donor restriction expires, that is, when a stipulated time restriction ends or pu rpose restriction is met, net assets with donor restrictions related to capital pu rchases are reclassified as n et assets without donor restrictions and reflected as net assets released from restrictions used for the purchase of property and equipment in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and changes in net assets , whereas net assets with do nor restrictions related to other gifts are reclassified as net assets without restricti ons and recorded as other operating revenue. Gifts received with no restrictions a re recorded as contributions in operating revenues. Gifts of long-lived operating assets, such as property and equipment, are reported as additio ns to net assets without donor restrictions, unless otherwise specified by the donor. Unconditional promises to give cash and other assets to CommonS pirit are recorded at fair value at the date the promise is received using a disco unt rate based on the U.S. Tre asury yield rates and are generally due within five years. Conditional promises to give are recorded when the condi tions have been substantially met. Donor indications of intentions to give are not recorded; such gifts are recorded at fair value o nly upon actual receipt of the gift or pledge. Investment income on net assets with donor restrictions is classified pursuant to the intent or requirement of the donor. Total net assets with donor restrictions are $1.1 billion as of June 30, 2022 and 2021. Of these net assets with donor restrictions, endowment net assets totaled $295 million a nd $272 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Endowment assets, which are primarily to be used for equipment and expansion, research and education, or charity purposes, include donor-restricted funds that CommonSpi rit must hold in perpetuity or for a donor- specified period. Changes in endowment net assets primarily rel ate to investment returns, contributions, and appropriations for expenditures. CommonSpirit preserves the fai r value of these gifts as of the date of donation unless otherwise stipulated by th e donor. Donor-restricted endo wment funds are classified as net assets with donor restrictions until those amounts are appropriated for expenditu re. CommonSpirit considers the following factors in making a determination to a ppropriate or accumulate donor-re stricted endowment funds: (1) the duration and preservation of the fund, (2) the purposes of the organization and the donor-restricted endowment fund, (3) general economic conditions, (4) the possi ble effects of inflation and deflation, (5) the expected total return from income and the appreciation of investments, (6) other resources of Com monSpirit, and (7) the investment policies of CommonSpirit. CommonSpirit has investment and spending policies for endowment assets designed to provide a predictable stream of funding to programs supported by its endowments while seeking to maintain the purchasing power of the endowment assets. Endowment assets are invested in a manner that is intended to p roduce results that achieve the respective benchmark while assuming a moderate level of investment risk. A ctual returns in any giv en year may vary from this amount. To satisfy its long-term rate-of-return objectives , CommonSpirit relies on a total return strategy in which investment returns are achieved through both capital appr eciation (realized and unrealized) and current yield (interest and dividends). CommonSpirit targets a diversif ied asset allocation to ach ieve its long-term return objectives within prudent risk constraints. Community Benefits - As part of its mission, CommonSpirit provides services to th e poor and benefits for the broader community. The costs incurred to provide such services are included in excess (d eficit) of revenues over expenses in the accompanying con solidated statements of operati ons and changes in net assets. CommonSpirit prepares a summary of unsponsored community benefit expense in accordance with Internal Revenue Service Form 990, Schedule H, and the Catholic Health Association of th e United States (\"CHA\") publication, A Guide for Planning and Reporting Community Benefit . See Note 20. Interest Expense - Interest expense on debt issued for construction projects is capitalized until the projects are placed in service. Interest expense, net, includes interest and fees on debt, net of these capitalized amounts. See Note 16. 15 Income Taxes - CommonSpirit has established its status as an organization e xempt from income taxes under Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(3) and the laws of the sta tes in which it operates, and as such, is generally not subject to federal or state income taxes. However, CommonSp irit's exempt organizations are subject to income taxes on net income deriv ed from a trade or business, re gularly carried on, which does not further CommonSpirit's exempt purposes. No significant income tax provi sion has been recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for net income derived from a n unrelated trade or business. CommonSpirit's for-profit subsidiaries account for income taxes related to its opera tions. The for-profit subsidiaries recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of their assets and liabilities, along with net operating loss and tax credit carryovers, for tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition cr iteria. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. Income tax interest and penalties are recorded as income tax ex pense. For the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, CommonSpirit's taxable entities recorded an immaterial am ount of interest and penalties as part of the provision for income taxes. CommonSpirit's taxable entities did not have any material unrecognized income tax expense as of June 30, 2022 and 2021. CommonSpirit reviews its tax positions quarterly and has determined that there are no material uncertain tax positions that require reco gnition in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Performance Indicator - Management considers excess (deficit) of revenues over expen ses to be CommonSpirit's performance indicator. Excess (deficit) of reven ues over expenses includes all changes in net assets without donor restrictions except for the effect of cont ributions with donor restrictions, contribution from business combinations, changes in accounting principles, net as sets released from restrictions used for purchase of capital and operations, change in funded status of pension a nd other postretirement benefit plans, gains and losses from discontinued operations, and other changes, includi ng change in ownership interests held by controlled subsidiaries and change in accumulated unrealized de rivative gains and losses. Operating and Nonoperating Activities - CommonSpirit's primary purpose is to provide a variety of healt h care- related activities, education and other benefits to the communi ties in which it operates. Activities directly related to the furtherance of this purpose are recorded as operating ac tivities. Other activities outside of this mission are reported as nonoperating activities. Such activities include ne t investment income (loss), loss on early extinguishment of debt, income tax expense, interest cost and c hanges in fair value of interest rate swaps, contributions from business combinations, other components of n et periodic postretirement costs, and the nonoperating component of Joint Operating Agreement (\"JOA\") inc ome share adjustments. Recent Accounting Pronouncements - In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-14, Compensation - Retirement Benefits - Defined Benefit Plans - General (S ubtopic 715-20) Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans , which applies to employer sponsored defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. The amendments modify, remove and add certain disclosure requirements. CommonSpirit adopted this updated disclosure requ irements for the annual period ended June 30, 2022. See Note 17. Subsequent Events - CommonSpirit has evaluated subsequent events occurring between the end of the most recent fiscal year and September 2 2, 2022, the date the consoli dated financial statements were issued. See Notes 3, 4 and 14. 3. ACQUISITIONS, AFFILIATIONS AND DIVESTITURES Yavapai Regional Medical Center - In November 2020, a consolidat ed affiliate of CommonSpirit, D ignity Community Care (\"DCC\"), and Yavap ai Community Hospital Associat ion, dba Yavapai Regional Medical Center (\"YRMC\"), an Arizona non profit corporatio n, effected a b usiness combination which transferred the sole membership of YRMC and its applicable subsidiaries to DCC for n o cash consideration. YRMC owns and operates two acute care hospitals, a regional wellness center, a n i m a g i n g c e n t e r , a n e t w o r k o f p r i m a r y a n d specialty physician clinics, and a fundraising foundation in th e Prescott, Arizona area. The transaction resulted in the recognition of a $507 million gain in the year ended June 3 0, 2021, recorded in contribution from business combinations in nonoperating income (loss) in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and changes in net assets, and $5 million recorded in contribution from business combinations for net assets with 16 donor restrictions, calculated as the fair value of the excess of identifiable assets acquired over liabilities assumed, determined based on Level 3 inputs, including estimated future cash flows and probability-weighted performance assumptions. Virginia Mason Health System - In January 2021, CommonSpirit formed a new integrated health system through the creation of a Joint Operating Company (\"JOC\"), Virginia Mas on Franciscan Health (\"VMFH\"), a Washington nonprofit corporation, bringing together CommonSpirit Francisca n Health System and Virginia Mason Health System (\"VMHS\"). With the addition of an acute hospital and oth er care sites from VMHS, VMFH now operates eleven hospitals and nearly 300 sites of care within the Pacifi c Northwest. The JOC is a controlled subsidiary of CommonSpirit. Based on the terms of the JOC agreement, CommonSp irit will consolidate the operations of VMHS and accounted for the business combination using the acqui sition method of accounting. The agreement did not include consideration and resulted in the recognition o f a $511 million gain in the year ended June 30, 2021, recorded in contribution from business combinations in no noperating income (loss) in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and changes in net assets , and $73 million recorded in contribution from business combinations for net assets with donor restrictions, c alculated as the fair value of the excess of identifiable assets acquired over liabilities assumed, determin ed based on Level 3 inputs, including estimated future cash flows and probability -weighted performance assumpti ons. The following summarizes the fair value estimate of YRMC's and VMHS's assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of November 1, 2020, and January 1, 2021, respective ly (in millions): Other - In February 2022, CommonSpirit entered into a definitive agreem ent to acquire two hospital facilities, one in western Kansas and one in northern Colorado, and the tra nsaction was finalized in May 2022. The acquired facilities support the mission and strategy to expand the scope and quality of care in those rural and surrounding communities, and will be managed b y Centura Health pursuant to the existing JOA. The purchase price is immaterial to the consolidated financial statements. In March 2021, CommonSpirit sold a portion of its investment in a joint venture resulting in a pretax gain of $523 million, which is included in other operating revenue in the co nsolidated statements of operations and changes in net assets. Income tax expense of $93 million is recorded in no noperating income (loss) rel ated to the transaction. CommonSpirit will continue to acc ount for its remaining interes t in the joint venture under the equity method. Held for Sale - In April 2022, CommonSpirit and Trinity Health signed an agre ement for Trinity Health to acquire all facilities and assets of MercyOne, a regional health system in Iowa. MercyOne has operated under a JOA between Trinity Health and CommonSpirit. The transaction close d in September 2022, for a purchase price of $613 million. As such, certain assets and liabilities of the I owa ministries are classified as held for sale, within other current assets and other accrued liabilities - current, r espectively, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2022.

COVID-19 PANDEMIC In December 2019, a novel strain o f coronavirus, known as COVID -19, was first detected. The virus spread worldwide and in March 2020 was d eclared a pandemic by the Worl d Health Organization. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention co nfirmed the first case in the United States in February 2020, and with the rapid spread across all 50 states, the United States government passe d new laws designed to help the nation respond to this pandemic. The CARES PRF funds provide stimulus in the form of financial a id to cover extensive emergency funding to hospitals and providers through existing mechanisms to prevent, prepare for, and respond to COVID-19. For the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, CommonSpirit has received a pproximately $21 million and $478 million, respectively, under CARES PRF in the form of grants as reimburs ement through the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund for lost revenues attributable to COVID -19. These funds are not required to be repaid upon attestation and compliance with certain terms and conditio ns. For the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, $27 million and $690 million, respectively, has been recognized within other operating revenue as earned. As of June 30, 2022 and 2021, $9 million and $15 million, respectivel y, of deferred revenue is included within other accrued liabilities - current, in the consolidated balance shee ts. CommonSpirit will continue to monitor the terms and conditions of CARES PRF funding and the impact of the pande mic on revenues and expenses. Additional CARES PRF funds totaling $259 million were received in July and August 2022 that will be recognized in 2023. Additional relief to address the continued impact of COVID-19 w as provided through the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (\"ARP Rural\"), in addition to the CARES PRF funds. For the year ended June 30, 2022, CommonSpirit has received approximately $149 million ARP Rural funds in the form of grants recorded as other operating revenues. To date, CommonSpirit also recei ved $2.8 billion in funds under the Medicare Accelerated and Advance Payment Program, which was received in the entirety prior to fiscal yea r 2022. These payments are advances that will be recouped by withholding future M edicare fee-for-service payment s for claims until such time as the full accelerated payment has been reco uped. As of June 30, 2022 and 2021, the terms and conditions in effect at that Cash and cash equivalents 35 $ Patient accounts receivable, net 148 Other current assets 50 Long-term investments 70 Property and equipm ent, net 362 Right-of-use operating lease assets 121 Ownership interests in health-related activities 117 Other long-term assets, net 5 Total assets held for sale 908 $ Current portion of long-term debt 1 $ Accounts payable 16 Accrued salaries and benefits 49 Medicare advances 32 Other accrued liabilities - current 45 Operating lease liabilities 104 Other accrued liabilities - long-term 2 Long-term debt, net of current portion 1 Total liabilities held for sale 250 $ 18 time prescribed that any outstanding balance remaining after 29 months from date of receipt are subject to interest of 4%. As such, as of June 30, 2022, $793 million is recorded a s a current liability in Medicare advances and $32 million is recorded in current liabilities as held for sale. A s of June 30, 2021, $1.4 billion was recorded as a current liability in Medicare a dvances, and $1.1 billion was re corded in Medicare advances - long-term. CommonSpirit had deferred approximately $416 million of employe r payroll taxes through June 30, 2022, pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enh ancement Act, of which $208 million was paid in December 2021, and $208 million is record ed as a current lia bility in accrued salaries and benefits. CommonSpirit recorded $67 million of Employee Retention Credits under CARES PRF during the year ended June 30, 2022. These funds relate to qualified wages paid betwe en April 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020, and are recorded in other operating revenue. While the aid received from the p rograms above provides much ne eded assistance during this crisis, CommonSpirit is unable to assess the extent to which the amount s and benefits received, or to be received, will offset the negative impacts on its results of consolidated oper ations and financial position arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. 5. NET PATIENT REVENUE The percentage of inpatient and outpatient services, calculated on the basis of usual and customary charges, is as follows for the years ended June 30: Patient revenue, net of contractual discounts and adjustments a nd implicit price concessions, is comprised of the following for the years ended June 30 (in millions): Government payor type includes M edicare fee for service, Medica re capitated, Medicare managed care fee for service, Medicaid fee for servi ce, Medicaid capitated and Medic aid managed care fee for service patient accounts. Contracted payor type includes contracted rate payors and comme accounts. 2,279 Net patient revenue 30,490 $ 28,996 $ 19 Total operating revenues by serv ice line are as follows for the years ended June 30 (in millions): 6.

CASH AND INVESTMENTS CommonSpirit's cash and investments include consolidated member ship interests in the CommonSpirit Health Operating Investment Pool, LLC (\"CSH OIP\") as of June 30, 2022 and 2021. Short-term and long-term investments also include assets limited as to use set aside by CommonSpirit for future long-term purposes as outlined below (in millions): 8. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS CommonSpirit accounts f or certain assets and liabilities at fai r value or on a basis that approximates fair value. A fair value hierarchy for valuation inputs categorizes the input s into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. Each fair value measurement is reported in one of the three levels and is determined by the lowest level of input tha t is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are: Level 1: Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical ass ets or liabilities as of the measurement date. Financial assets in this category include money market fu nds, U.S. Treasury securities and listed equities. Level 2: Pricing inputs are based upon qu oted prices for similar instrum ents in active market s, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not ac tive, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabiliti es. Financial assets and liabilities in this category generally include asset-backed securities, corporate bonds and loans, municipal bonds, and derivative instruments. Level 3: Pricing inputs are generally unobservable for the assets or liabilities and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the investment. Th e inputs into the determination of fair value require management's judgment or estimation of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques that include option pricing models, discounted cash flow models, and similar techni ques. 2022 2021 Cash and cash equivalents 2,592 Short-term investments 596 1,124 for self-insured claims 1,758 1,888 Under bond indenture agreements for debt service 78 85 Donor-restricted 579 607 Other 613 707 Total assets lim ited as to use 3,028 3,287 Unrestricted cash and investments 16,247 $ 20,663 $ 21 The following represents assets and liabilities measured at fai r value or at the NAV practical expedient on a recurring basis as of June 30 (in millions): Quoted Prices in Activ e Significant Markets for Other Significant Identical Observ able Unobserv able Instruments Inputs Inputs (Lev el 1) (Lev el 2) (Lev el 3) Total Assets Cash and short-term investm ents 2,963 $ 420 $ - $ 3,383 $ U.S. government securities 944 476 - 1,420 U.S. corporate bonds 73 588 - 661 U.S. equity securities 1,553 3 - 1,556 Foreign government securities - 79 - 79 Foreign corporate bonds 1 192 - 193 Foreign equity securities 1,558 1 - 1,559 Asset-backed securities - 143 - 143 Private equity - - 64 64 Multi-strategy hedge funds 10 - - 10 Real estate 28 1 29 Comm unity Investm ent Program - - 127 127 Other investm ents 172 177 - 349 Assets measured at fair value 7,302 $ 2,080 $ 191 $ 9,573 Assets at NAV 9,772 L ess: Assets classified as held for sale included above (70) Total assets 19,275 $ Liabilities Derivative instruments - $ 234 $ - $ 234 $ Other 1 - 100 101 Total liabilities 1 $ 234 $ 100 $ 335 $ 2022 22 Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring ba sis reflected in the table above are reported in short- term investments, long-term investments, current liabilities an d other liabilities - long term in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Level 2 and 3 instruments listed in the fair value hierarch y tables above use the following valuation techniques and inputs: For marketable securities, such as U.S. and foreign government securities, U.S. and fore ign corporate bonds, U.S. and foreign equity securitie s, mortgage and asset-backed s ecurities, and structured debt, in the instances where identical quoted market prices are not readily available, fair value is determined using quoted market prices and/or other market data for comparable instruments and transactions in establishing prices, discounted cash flow models and other pricing models. These inputs to fair value are included in industry-standard valuation techniques, such as th e income or market approach. Co mmonSpirit classifies all such investments as Level 2. For private equity investments wh ere no fair value is readily a vailable, the fair value is determined using models that take into account relevant information considered m aterial. Due to the significant unobservable inputs present in these valuations, CommonSpirit classifies all such investments as Level 3. Quoted Prices in Activ e Significant Markets for Other Significant Identical Observ able Unobserv able Instruments Inputs Inputs (Lev el 1) (Lev el 2) (Lev el 3) Total Assets Cash and short-term investments 3,543 $ 289 $ - $ 3,832 $ U.S. government securities 1,350 489 - 1,839 U.S. corporate bonds 120 1,314 - 1,434 U.S. equity securities 2,969 5 - 2,974 Foreign government securities - 256 - 256 Foreign corporate bonds 1 825 - 826 Foreign equity securities 3,008 1 - 3,009 Asset-backed securities - 146 - 146 Private equity - - 65 65 Real estate 49 1 - 50 Community Investment Program - - 132 132 Other investments 234 182 - 416 Assets measured at fair value 11,274 $ 3,508 $ 197 $ 14,979 Assets at NAV 8,971 Total assets 23,950 $ Liabilities Derivative instrum ents - $ 472 $ - $ 472 $ Other 4 - 9 0 9 4 Total liabilities 4 $ 472 $ 9 0 $ 566 $ 2021 23 The fair value of collateral held under securities lending prog ram is classified as Level 2. The collateral held under this program is placed in commingled funds whose underlyi ng investments are valued using techniques similar to those used for the marketable securities noted above . Amounts reported do not include noncash collateral of $56 million and $209 million as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The fair value of assets and liabilities for derivative instrum ents, such as interest rate swaps classified as Level 2, is determined using an industry standard valuation mod el, which is based on a market approach. A credit risk spread (in basis points) is added as a flat spread to the discount curve used in the valuation model. Each leg is discounted and the difference between the present v alue of each leg's cash flows equals the fair value of the swap. Investments that are measured using the NAV per share practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. The NAV amounts presented in the table above a re intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented in the consolidated ba lance sheets. Related to investments valued using the NAV per share practical expedient, management also performs, on a regular basis when information is available, various validation s and testing of NAV provided and determines that the investment managers' valuation techniques are compliant wit h fair value measuremen t accounting standards. Level 3 financial assets tota ling $51 million were recorded thr ough contributions from business combinations in 2021 related to the fo rmation of CSH OIP. The following table and explana tions identify attributes relati ng to the nature and risk of investments for which fair value is determined using a calculated NAV as of June 30, 2022 (in millions): (1) This category includes private eq uity funds that specialize in providing capital to a variety of investment groups, including, but not limited to, venture capital, leverag ed buyout, mezzanine debt, distressed debt, and other situations. There are no provisions for redemptions durin g the life of these funds. Distributions from each fund will be received as the underlying investments of the funds are liquidated, estimated at June 30, 2022, to be over the next 12 years.

The primary objective for these funds is to seek attractive long-term, risk-adjusted absolute r eturns. Under certain circumstances, an otherwise redeemable investment or portion thereof could become restricted. The following table reflects the various redemption frequencies, notice periods, and any applica ble lock-up periods or gates to redemption as of June 30, 2022: (3) This category includes investmen ts in real estate funds that in vest primarily in institutional-quality commercial and residential real estate assets within the U.S. a nd investments in publicly traded real estate investment trusts. Investments representing 15% of the value of investments in this category do not have provisions for redemptions during the life of these funds. Dist ributions will be received as the underlying investments of the funds are liquidated, estimated at June 30, 2022, to be over the next 11 years. (4) This category includes investme nts in commingled funds that inv est primarily in domestic and foreign debt and fixed income securities, the majority of which are traded i n over-the-counter markets.

LEASES CommonSpirit enters into operatin g and finance leases primarily for buildings and equipment and determines if an arrangement is a lease at in ception of the contract. For lea ses with terms greater than 12 months, CommonSpirit records the related right-of-use asset (\"ROU\") and lease liabil ity at the present value of lease payments over the contract term using a risk-free interest rate, subject to certa in adjustments. CommonSpirit does not separate contract lease and non-lease components except for a class of u nderlying assets related to supply agreements, which include associated equipmen t. Certain building lease agre ements require CommonSpirit to pay maintenance, repairs, property t axes and insurance costs, which are variable amounts based on actual costs incurred during each applicable p eriod. Such costs are not incl uded in the determination of the ROU asset or lease liability. Lease costs also include escalating rent payments th at are not fixed at commencement but are based on the Consumer Price Index or other measure of cost inflation. Fu ture changes in the indices are included within variable lease costs. Certain leases include one or more option s to renew the lease at the end of the initial term, with renewal terms that generally extend the lease at the then market rate of rental payment. Certain leases also include an option to buy the underlying asset at or a short tim e prior to the termination of the lease. All such options are at CommonSpirit's discretion and are evaluated at t he commencement of the lease, with only those that are reasonably certain of ex ercise included in determining the appropriate lease term and lease type. 34 The components of lease cost, net for the year ended June 30 ar e as follows (in millions): Following is supplemental consol idated balance sheet informatio n related to leases as of June 30 (in millions): Supplemental cash flow and other i nformation related to leases for the years ended June 30 are as follows (in millions): 2022 2021 Operating lease cost 298 $ 336 $ Variable lease cost 181 152 Short-term rent ex pense 81 69 Amortization of right-of-use assets 33 41 Interest on finance lease liabilities 10 11 Sublease income (10) ( 5 ) Total lease cost, net 593 $ 604 $ Lease Type Balance Sheet Classification 2022 2021 Operating Leases: Operating lease ROU assets Right-of-use operating lease assets 1, 715 $ 1,892 $ Operating lease obligations - current Other accrued liab ilities - current 263 281 Operating lease obligations - long-term Operating lease liabilit ies 1,626 1,801 Finance Leases: Finance lease ROU assets Property and equipment, net 299 293 Current finance lease liabilities Current portion of long-term d ebt 38 36 Long-term finance lease liabilities Long-term debt, net of curre nt portion 305 334 2022 2021 ROU assets obtained in ex change for new operating lease liabili ties 248 $ 371 $ ROU assets obtained in exchange for new finance lease liabiliti es 58 175 Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liab ilities: Operating cash flows from operating leases 312 346 Operating cash flows from finance leases 10 11 Financing cash flows from finance leases 34 34 Weighted-average remaining lease term: Operating leases 9 years 11 yearsFinance leases 18 years 19 years Weighted-average discount rate: Operating leases 2.0% 2.0% Finance leases 4.0% 4.0% 35 Commitments related to operating and finance leases for each of the next five years and th ereafter as of June 30, 2022, are as follows (in millions): 16.

RETIREMENT PROGRAMS CommonSpirit maintains defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans that cover most Dignity Health and CHI employees. Benefits for both types of pl ans are generally based on age, years of service and employee compensation. Certain of CHI's plans were frozen in previous years, and benef its earned by employees through that time period remain in the retirement plans where employees continue to rece ive interest credits and vesting credits, if applicable. Actuarial valuations are performed for all of the plans. These valuations are dependent on various assumptions. These assumptions include the discount rate and the expected ra te of return on plan assets (for pension), which are important elements of expense and liability measurement. Ot her assumptions involve demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality, turnover, and the rate of co mpensation increases. CommonSpirit evaluates all assumptions in conjunction with the valuation updates and modif ies them as appropriate. In the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, the actuarial gains and losses were primaril y driven by the change in discount rate assumption. Pension costs and other postretir ement benefit costs are alloca ted over the service period of the employees in the plans. The principle underlying this accounting is that employe es render service ratably over the period, and therefore, the effects in the acc ompanying consolidated stateme nts of operations and changes in net assets follow the same pattern. Net actuarial gains and losses are amortized to expense on a plan-by-plan basis when they exceed the accounting corridor. The accounting corridor is a de fined range within which amortization of net gains and losses is not required and is equal to 10% of the greater o f the plan assets or benefit obligations. Gains or losses outside of the corridor are subject to amortization over the average employee future service period. Contributions to the defined benefit pension plans are based on actuarially determined amounts sufficient to meet the benefits to be paid to plan participants.

Contributions to these funded plans are anticipated at $163 million in 2023, whi ch exceeds the funding policy minimum contributions.

The asset allocation policy for the pension plans for 2021 is a s follows: domestic fixed income, 12%; international fixed income, 2%; domestic equity, 32%; international equity, 2 6%; private equity, 10.5%; hedge funds, 9%; real assets, 6%; and cash and opportunistic, 2.5%. CommonSpirit's investment strategy for the assets of the pensio n plans is designed to achieve returns to meet obligations and grow the assets of the portfolios longer term, consistent with a prudent level of risk. The strategy balances the liquidity needs of the pension plans with the long -term return goals necessary to satisfy future obligations. The target asset allocation is diversified across traditional and non-traditional asset classes. Diversification is also achieved through participation in U.S. and non-U.S. markets, market capitalization, and investment manager style and philosophy. The complementary inve stment styles and approaches used by both traditional and alternative invest ment managers are aimed at re ducing volatility while capturing the equity premium from the capital markets over the long term. Risk toler ance is established through consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status, and corporate financial condit ion. Consistent with CommonSpirit's fiduciary responsibilities, the fixed income allocation generally provide s for security of principal to meet near-term expenses and obligations. Periodic reviews of the market values and corresponding asset allocation percentages are performed to determine wheth er a rebalancing of the portfol io is necessary. CommonSpirit's pension plan portfolio return assumptions for 20 22 and 2021 were based on the long-term weighted-average returns of comparative market indices for the asset classes represented in the portfolio and expectations about future returns. The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future s ervice, are expected to be paid (in millions): CommonSpirit maintains defined contribution retirement plans fo r most employees. Employer contributions to those plans of $407 million and $362 million for 2022 and 2021, respectively, included in salaries and benefits in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and chan ges in net assets, are primarily based on a percentage of a partic ipant's contribution. 2022 2021 Cash and cash equivalents government 2%U.S. corporate bonds securities 14% 763 8,001 $ 41 18. COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENT LIABIL ITIES, GUARANTEES AND OTHER The following summary encompasses matters related to litigation , regulatory and compliance matters, and developments thereto. General - The health care industry is subject to voluminous and complex laws and regulations of federal, state and local governments. Compliance with such laws and regulation s can be subject to future government review and interpretation as well as regulatory actions unknown or una sserted at this time. These laws and regulations include, but are not necessarily limited to, the rules governin g licensure, accreditation, controlled substances, privacy, government program participation, government reimburse ment, antitrust, anti-kickback, prohibited referrals by physicians, false claims, and in the case of tax-e xempt organizations, the requirements of tax exemption. Management believes C ommonSpirit is materially in co mpliance with all applicable laws and regulations of the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Compliance w ith such laws and regulations is complex and can be subject to future governmental interpretation as well as significant regulatory action, including fines, penalties and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs . Certain CommonSpirit entities have been contacted by governmental agencies regarding alleged violations of Medicare practices for certain services. Additionally, certain CommonSpirit entities have identified and self-disclosed potential instances of noncompliance with applicable regulations. In the opinion of ma nagement after consultation with legal counsel, the ultimate outcome of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on CommonSpirit's consolidated financial statements. In recent years, government activ ity has increased with respect to investigations and allegations of wrongdoing. In addition, during the course of business, CommonSpirit become s involved in civil litigation. Management assesses the probable outcome of unresolved litigation and inve stigations and records contingent liabilities reflecting estimated liability exp osure. Following is a discuss ion of matters of note. Pension Plan Litigation - In April 2013, Dignity Health was served with a class action lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California b y a former employee alleging breaches of fiduciary duty and other claims under ERISA in connection with the Dignit y Health Pension Plan (\"DHPP\"). Among other things, the complaint originally alleged th at, because Dignity Health is not a church or an association of churches, the DHPP does not qualify as a \"ch urch plan\". The complaint als o challenged the constitutionality of ERISA's church plan exemption. Dignity Health and the sponsoring religi ous orders established the DHPP and determined the DHPP was a church plan that should be exempt from ERISA, in cluding ERISA's funding requirements, and received private letter rulings from the Internal Revenue Servi ce that confirmed its church plan status. The plaintiff sought to represent a class comprised of participants and beneficiaries of the DHPP as of April 2013, when the complaint was filed. In July 2014, the District Court ruled that only a church or an association of churches may establish a church plan; the DHPP did not qualify as a chu rch plan since Dignity Health was not a church when the plan was established, and, therefore, DHPP was not exempt from ERISA. Dignity Health appealed the decision. In July 2016, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued its opinion, which affirmed the District Court's order and held that a church plan must be established by a church or by an association of churche s and must be maintained either by a church or by a church-controlled or church-a ffiliated organization whose pri ncipal purpose or function is to provide benefits to church employees. The Ninth Circuit remanded the case to the District Court for fu rther proceedings. Dignity Health appealed the decision to the United States Supre me Court, which agreed to hear Dignity Health's case together with those of two other faith-based health system s facing similar challenges to church plan status. In June 2017, the Supreme Court issued its unanimous opinion re versing the decision of the Ninth Circuit. The Court concluded that the 1980 amendment to Section 3(33)(C) of ERISA was intended by Congress to expand the types of pension plans that could qualify as church plans t o include plans maintained by faith-based organizations such as Dignity Health and regardless of who firs t established the plans. The decision did not determine whether Dignity Health satisfied the requirements to maintain a church plan. In fact, the Court specifically noted that it was not deciding (1) whether any hos pital was sufficiently associated with a church for its pension plan to qualify for the church plan exemption, or ( 2) whether an internal retirement committee could qualify as a \"principal purpose\" organization entitled to maint ain a church plan. The Supreme Court remanded the case to the Ninth Circuit fo r further action based on its d ecision. Based on the Supreme Court's decision, the Ninth Circuit return ed the case to the District Court to continue the proceedings with regard to the two outstanding questions and ot her claims that were not decided by the Supreme 42 Court. The plaintiff amended its original complaint in November 2017, and Dignity Health filed a motion to dismiss the case in December 2017 . The motion was heard in Marc h 2018. In September 2018, the District Court issued its ruling denying Dignity Health's motion to dismiss. T he decision was primarily based upon the procedural standard that requires the Court to accept the plain tiff's allegations in the amended complaint as true and does not permit Dignity Health to refute those allegations. As a result, the Court found that the amended complaint was sufficient to withstand dismissal at this stage, but encouraged the parties to further develop the factual record as a basis to c onsider Dignity Health's objectio ns in the future. The parties subsequently agreed to settle the litigation. In M arch 2022, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California granted final approval of the s ettlement agreement. The settlement resolves all claims asserted in the litigation and releases the named defend ants and certain other releases in exchange for certain mandatory cash contributions to the DHPP over a five-ye ar period, certain one-time payments, and non- monetary relief with respect to DHPP administration and accrued benefits protection, bringing the litigation to a full and final end. The terms of the settlement do not material ly change the commitments Dignity Health has and continues to honor with respect to the DHPP. The settlement wi ll have no impact on the financial position or results of operations of CommonSpirit. Seismic standards - T h e S t a t e o f C a l i f o r n i a i s s u e d s eismic safety standards in 199 4 which have since been amended on several occasions. Th e regulations called for struct ural building upgrades to be in place by January 2013. Subsequent legislation extended the date of required imp rovements to 2030. Buildings improved or built to the new seismic standards may remain in an acute care servic e beyond 2030. Each of the acute care service buildings at CommonSpirit's Cali fornia facilities either: (1) already meets the standards in effect until 2030, (2) is not subject to these sta ndards, (3) will not be used for acute care services beyond the extended deadline, or (4) is scheduled to undergo re mediation before applicable deadline dates. The amount of capital required for meeting the 2030 standards, both structural or non-structural, is not yet determined, but is anticipated to be material. In addition to the foregoing, in late 2014, the State of Califo rnia created a new seismic performance category allowing buildings that were previously required to be decommis sioned in 2030 to remain in use indefinitely if they could be retrofitted to meet certain new standards. Common Spirit is undertaking the necessary evaluation of its buildings, to be completed by 2024, to test the viability o f their continued use beyond 2030. Long-term Contracts - CommonSpirit has entered into certain Master Services Agreeme nts (\"MSAs\") with related parties for the purchase of revenue cycle management se rvices that terminate in fiscal years 2031 and 2033. The agreements are amended from time to time and are subj ect to annual adjustments for inflation and achievement of certain performance levels, which reflect market terms. These amounts are recorded in purchased services and other in the accompanying statements of operations and changes in net assets. The MSAs are subject to significant penalties for cancellation without cause. Purchase Commitments - CommonSpirit has entered into various agreements that requir e certain minimum purchases of goods and services, including management services agreements for information and clinical technology and sponsorship agreem ents, at levels consistent wit h normal business requirements. Excluding the long-term contracts noted above, outstanding unconditional purc hase commitments were approximately $378 million at June 30, 2022. 19. FUNCTIONAL EXPENSES CommonSpirit provides health care services, including inpatient , outpatient, ambulatory, long-term care and community-based services to individuals within the various geog raphic areas supported by its facilities.

UNSPONSORED COMMUNITY BENEFIT EXPENSE (UNAUDITED) Unsponsored community benefits are programs or activities that provide treatment and/or promote health and healing as a response to identified community needs. These bene fits (a) generate a low or negative margin, (b) respond to the needs of special populations, such as persons li ving in poverty and other d isenfranchised persons, (c) supply services or programs that would likely be discontinu ed, or would need to be provided by another nonprofit or government provider, if the decision was made on a purely financial basis, (d) respond to public health needs, and/or (e) involve education or research that imp roves overall community health. The unpaid costs of Medicaid/Medi-Cal includes $225 million and $493 million in direct benefit expense related to the California provider fee program in 2022 and 2021, respec tively, and direct offsetting revenue related to the program of $529 million and $1.0 billion for 2022 and 2021, res pectively. Benefits for the Poor include services provided to persons who are low-income or med ically indigent and cannot afford to pay for health care services because they have insuff icient resources and/or are uninsured or underinsured. Serving these populations helps to achieve health equity. Benefits for the Broader Community refer to programs in the general communities that CommonSpirit serves, including but beyond those for low-income and vulnerable person s. Most services for the broader community are aimed at improving the health and welfare of the overall commun ity. CommonSpirit provides services to nonprofit organizations that promote the total health of their local comm unities, including the development of and connection to health and social services, support for affordabl e housing and healthy food, increasing opportunities for jobs and job training, and expanding access to health care for uninsured and underinsured persons. Financial Assistance (Charity Care) is free or discounted health services provided to persons who c annot afford to pay and who meet CommonSpirit' s criteria for financial assis tance.
