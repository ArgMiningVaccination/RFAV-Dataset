Became a doctor of naturopathy and a health educator. Supervised more than 30,000 fasts between 1925 and 1970. Published \"Dr. Shelton's Hygienic Review.\" Wrote more than forty books. Operated a health school in San Antonio, Texas. Promoted Natural Hygiene. Much persecuted for his outspoken denunciation of orthodox medicine. Died in Texas. As expected, this booklet is an outspoken condemnation of vaccination, which Shelton regarded as a \"filthy practice\" originating in religious superstition. The first chapter presents vaccination as dangerous, based on testimonials and epidemiological records. He cites newspaper accounts of people harmed by vaccines, and cases from medical journals. Such anecdotal evidence doesn't necessarily prove anything. In chapter two he argues from logic and empirical evidence that vaccination is ineffective in conferring immunity. The whole vaccination practice is predicated on the belief that diseases such as smallpox and diphtheria confer immunity to themselves. Not true, says Shelton, citing many examples of recurrences. The answer to infectious diseases is \"scrupulous hygiene,\" not inoculations with septic matter. In chapter three, Shelton urges readers not to contribute money to medically-controlled organizations like the Red Cross that promote vaccinations. This booklet may be somewhat outdated, as vaccines may have changed a bit since its time. But its principles are still worthy of consideration. Questions remain: Vaccines consist of \"septic matter (pus)\" from infected animals, says Shelton. If we grant that all vaccinations are toxic, are they still acceptable as lesser evils? Compulsory vaccination is still criminal, he answers. How do vaccines work? Shelton's simple answer is that they don't work. I wish he had gone into the science of immunology and less into mere anecdotes and testimonials, but he seems to deny the validity of immunology. This booklet is worth reading. Typos detract from its readability, but not much from its credibility. Although not a recent book, the data presented is conclusive proof that the vaccines for smallpox and many other diseases mentioned, were not only not helpful in preventing the diseases they were supposedly inoculating against, but also harmful to a great many. A short book, but a great read none the less. "}
