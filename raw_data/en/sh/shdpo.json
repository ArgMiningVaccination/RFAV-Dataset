Chiropractic care finds the root cause of the problem that lead to such as muscle spasms, pinched nerves, neck pain, leg pain, back pain, sciatica, and headaches. Chiropractic is safe, non-invasive, and effective treatment that uses gentle manual adjustments to the spine to relieve pain in the back, neck, head, arms, and legs without drugs or surgery. Stress, bad posture, injuries, and other factors can cause spinal joints to lock and muscles to contract, resulting in a misalignment of the vertebrae that can pinch or irritate nearby nerves, resulting in pain, loss of movement, and a poor quality of life. Chiropractic adjustment is a procedure in which a highly trained Doctor of Chiropractic uses their hands or a small mechanical adjusting instrument to apply a controlled, specific, and gentle force to a spinal joint to restore proper motion and improve function of the nervous system. The goal of this procedure, also known as spinal manipulation, is to improve spinal motion and improve your body's physical function.

Dr Alex Asaturov provides both classic, hands-on chiropractic care and gentle instrument adjusting with the Arthrostim. An Arthrostim is a hand held mechanical adjusting instrument that Dr. Alex uses to deliver very precise, pain-free and effective spinal manipulations without the force or thrust applied by manual adjusting techniques. The Arthrostim treatment provides great results for a wide variety of people in Seattle who need pain and injury relief. If you have ever felt nervous about trying chiropractic care for natural pain relief because you expect popping, cracking and discomfort, then Arthrostim adjusting is for you. In fact, this gentle and extremely precise instrument provides the same benefits of our chiropractor's traditional adjustments to a wider variety of patients, including those who are very sensitive to touch like children and seniors. When the instrument is engaged, it will vibrate 12 times per second, delivering a percussive, yet gentle, non-force manipulation, bringing the vertebrae back into correct alignment with no twisting, popping or cracking. Additionally, the vibration rate of the Arthrostim stimulates the body's proprioceptors (sensory nerve receptors) that regulate correct alignment and motion of the musculoskeletal system. The result is a simultaneous mixture of relief and relaxation that our patients rave about. The Arthrostim can be an integral part of treatment for any condition that can be alleviated by chiropractic care. This includes everything from back and neck pain to sciatica, headaches, whiplash and bulging or herniated discs and more.

Current research shows that minor discomfort or soreness following spinal manipulation typically fades within 24 hours.

The noise is caused by the change of pressure within the joint, which results in gas bubbles being released. There is usually minimal, if any, discomfort involved. We utilize drop tables and specialized adjusting instruments (Arthrostim) that are gentle, specific, and highly effective - no popping necessary! Yes.
