Short-term market outlook Valmet reiterates the good short-term market outlook for pulp, and board and paper, the good/ satisfactory short-term market outlook for automation, the satisfactory short-term market outlook for energy, and tissue and the satisfactory/weak short-term market outlook for services. President and CEO Pasi Laine: The strong development in Paper continued \"Valmet's orders received amounted to EUR 700 million in the third quarter of 2020. Orders received increased in the Paper business line and in China. Orders received decreased in the Pulp and Energy, Automation and Services business lines. Our order backlog amounted to EUR 3,311 million. The short-term market outlook for pulp, and board and paper is good. Valmet's net sales remained at the previous year's level, and the Comparable EBITA increased to EUR 91 million, corresponding to a margin of 10.9 percent. Our balance sheet remained strong with a gearing of 18 percent. The COVID-19 pandemic continued to impact our operations in the third quarter. Travel restrictions and lower capacity utilization in graphical paper mills had a negative impact on Services order intake and net sales. Despite COVID-19, A utomation services order intake remained at the previous year's level, while capital order intake in Automation decreased. COVID-19 has not caused major impacts on Valmet's capital business. Our whole organization has performed well under the new circumstances and found new ways to operate, which can be utilized to improve Valmet's processes also after the pandemic. Furthermore, certain expenses were lower due to the pandemic. In the beginning of July, Valmet acquired 14.9 percent of Neles. During the quarter, Valmet increased its ownership gradually to 29.5 percent and proposed a statutory merger between Valmet and Neles. We see that the combination would create excellent long-term value to the shareholders of both companies. It has excellent industrial logic and would form a strong platform for further business growth especially in automation systems and valves. During the quarter, we entered into an agreement to acquire PMP Group in Poland. PMP supplies process technologies and services for tissue, board and paper machines globally, focusing on small and medium- sized tissue machines and board and paper machine rebuilds. PMP's product portfolio and presence in strategic markets will create new business opportunities for Valmet. The company employs about 650 people and we warmly welcome the new colleagues to Valmet.\" Valmet's Interim Review , % 3,311 3,425 -3 % Net sales 832 857 -3 % 2,573 2,444 5 % Comparable earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (Comparable EBITA) 91 81 11 % 218 198 10 % % of net sales 10.9 % 9.5 % 8.5 % 8.1 % Earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (EBITA) 87 83 5 % 208 196 6 % % of net sales 10.5 % 9.7 % 8.1 % 8.0 % Operating profit (EBIT) 79 73 9 % 184 172 7 % % of net sales 9.5 % 8.5% 7.1 % 7.0 % Profit before taxes 75 70 6 % 174 164 6 % Profit for the period 57 51 12 % 131 121 9 % Earnings per share, EUR 0.38 0.34 12 % 0.88 0.80 9 % Earnings per share, diluted, EUR 0.38 0.34 12 % 0.88 0.80 9 % Equity per share, EUR2 6.81 6.13 11 % 6.81 6.13 11 % Cash flow provided by operating activities 94 126 -25 % 418 113 >100% Cash flow after investments -380 102 -100 -102 -2 % Return on equity (ROE) (annualized) 17 % 17 % Return on capital employed (ROCE) before taxes (annualized) 17 % 19 % Equity to assets ratio2 38 % 38 % Gearing2 18 % 6 % 1The calculation of key figures is presented on page 44. 2At end of period.

Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on Valmet The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted Valmet's operations during the reporting period. Travel restrictions and lower capacity utilization in graphical paper mills had a negative impact on orders received and net sales of the Services business line. Many customers restricted access to their sites, which led to disturbances especially in field services and mill improvement projects. Also the Automation business line suffered from access restrictions to some customer sites. The Pulp and Energy, and Paper business lines have managed challenges caused by COVID-19 well, and therefore COVID-19 has not caused major impacts on the capital business. The organization has performed well under the new circumstances and found new ways to operate, which can be utilized to improve Valmet's processes also after the pandemic. For example, the increased use of industrial internet and remote connections have resulted in lower travel expenses. On April 21, 2020, Valmet announced that due to financial and production related reasons, especially because of the decreasing workload and in order to prepare for the potential widening of the business impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, the company starts co-determination negotiations on April 21, 2020 for temporary lay-offs. The employees under negotiations are the Services business line employees in Finland and EMEA area organization in Finland. The planned lay-offs are temporary and they last up to 90 days at maximum. At the time of the announcement, it was estimated that the need for lay-offs concerns around 200 employees. On April 24, 2020, Valmet announced that the co-determination negotiations had been completed, and as a result 72 employees in the Services business line in Finland and 105 employees in the EMEA area organization in Finland will be temporarily laid-off due to low workload. The lay-offs concern all employee groups. The lay-offs can be implemented until the end of October and the scope and length of a lay-off can vary up to 90 days at maximum. Structural changes Valmet announced on January 21, 2020 that it is planning changes in the Fabrics Business Unit which is part of the Services Business Line in order to secure the unit's profitability and future competitiveness. The most important action in the preliminary plan was to move the dryer fabric and wide filter fabric production from Tampere in Finland to Valmet's unit in Portugal. Valmet started co-determination negotiations in Fabrics' operations in Tampere on January 21, 2020. Valmet announced on March 17, 2020 that the co-determination negotiations have been completed. Valmet will relocate the dryer fabric and wide filter fabric production from Finland to Portugal. As a consequence of the relocation and re-organizing of the work, the need for workforce reduction in Tampere will be 78 persons mainly during 2021. In addition, the possibility for temporary lay-offs and part- time work remains if capacity adjustments need to be done later this year. For those affected by the reductions, Valmet will provide support measures like support for studies and re-employment. Valmet announced on May 26, 2020 that it continues measures to improve the long-term competitiveness of its stable business especially related to Mill Improvements and Rolls and Workshop Services business Valmet's Interim Review , January-September 2020| 15mainly in EMEA. The aim is to improve the profitability and competitiveness of the respective businesses by optimizing the local presence globally and streamlining the way to operate. The measures are planned to be implemented during 2020 and they may include permanent lay-offs and the restructuring of selected operations. In total the estimated amount of headcount reductions is up to 200 positions. Valmet's stable business employs altogether approximately 8,300 persons globally.

On February 5, 2020, Valmet announced the Board of Directors' decision to raise Valmet's financial targets for Comparable EBITA margin and return on capital employed. Valmet's new target for Comparable EBITA margin is 10-12% (previously 8-10%). The new target for Comparable return on capital employed (ROCE) before taxes is at least 20% (previously 15-20%). Valmet's other financial targets remained unchanged. Valmet's financial targets are the following: Financial targets Net sales for stable business to grow over two times the market growth Net sales for capital business to exceed market growth Comparable EBITA: 10-12% Comparable return on capital employed (pre-tax), ROCE: at least 20% Dividend payout at least 50% of net profit Continued focus on improving profitability Valmet continues to focus on improving profitability through various actions in e.g. sales process management, project management and project execution, in procurement and quality, as well as in technology and R&D.

Valmet has also set a target for quality cost savings and is adding focus on root cause analysis of quality deviations. Furthermore, Valmet is continuing to adopt the Lean principles and methodology. Valmet is constantly focusing on new technologies and R&D to improve product cost competitiveness and performance. The renewal of Valmet's ERP system will increase efficiency once implemented. Progress in sustainability During July-September 2020, Valmet progressed with the actions defined in its Sustainability360 agenda. Valmet conducts supplier sustainability audits with a certified third-party auditor to ensure its suppliers operate in compliance with Valmet's Sustainable Supply Chain Policy and local and international law. In addition to on-site audits, Valmet has piloted remote auditing in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In September 2020, Valmet's mid-year review discussions were completed by 98 percent of the employees included in the annual review process. Valmet also finished the enrollment process for its global mentoring program, which will include reverse mentoring for the first time. At the end of September, Valmet's lost time incident frequency rate (LTIF) for own employees was 1.6 (2.0 at the end of September 2019) and the total recordable incident frequency rate (TRIF) for own employees was 3.3 (4.4 at the end of September 2019). In September Valmet launched an external reporting portal for its stakeholders for managing events related to health, safety, environment and continuous improvement in all Valmet's operations. Valmet also continued to implement its global coronavirus management strategy. Valmet's Interim Review , January-September 2020| 17Lost time incident frequency (LTIF)1 and total recordable incident frequency (TRIF)2, own employees LTIF, rolling 12 of injuries resulting in an absence of at least one work day per million hours worked. 2LTIF + medical treatment and restricted work cases Lawsuits and claims Several lawsuits, claims and disputes based on various grounds are pending against Valmet in various countries, including product liability lawsuits and claims as well as legal disputes related to Valmet's deliveries. Valmet is also a plaintiff in several lawsuits. Valmet announced on December 22, 2016 that it has received a reassessment decision from the Finnish tax authority for Valmet Technologies Inc. The reassessment decision is a result of a tax audit carried out in the company, concerning tax years 2020-2012. During the first quarter 2017 Valmet paid additional taxes, late payment interests and penalties in total of EUR 19 million related to the reassessment decision. Valmet considers the Finnish tax authority's decision unfounded and has appealed of the decision. Valmet's management does not expect to the best of its present understanding that the outcome of these lawsuits, claims and disputes will have a material adverse effect on Valmet in view of the grounds currently presented for them, provisions made, insurance coverage in force and the extent of Valmet's total business activities. Corporate Governance Statement and Remuneration Report Valmet has prepared a separate Corporate Governance Statement and a Remuneration Report for 2019, which comply with the recommendations of the Finnish Corporate Governance Code for listed companies.

The maximum number of shares to be repurchased shall be 5,000,000 shares, which corresponds to approximately 3.3 percent of all the shares in the Company. The Company's own shares may be repurchased otherwise than in proportion to the shareholdings of the shareholders (directed repurchase). The Company's own shares may be repurchased using the unrestricted equity of the Company at a price formed on a regulated market on the stock exchange main list maintained by Nasdaq Helsinki Ltd on the date of the repurchase.

Share-based incentive plans Valmet's share-based incentive plans are part of the remuneration program for Valmet's key personnel. The purpose of the plans is to align the goals of shareholders and management to increase the value of the Company, to ensure management commitment, and to offer them a competitive, ownership-based reward scheme. Any shares to be potentially awarded are, or have been, acquired through public trading, and therefore the incentive plans have no diluting effect on the share value. Long-term incentive plan 2018-2020 In December 2017, the Board of Directors of Valmet Oyj approved a long-term share-based incentive plan for Valmet's key employees. The plan includes three performance periods, which are the calendar years 2018, 2019 and 2020 .

Valmet's Interim Review , January-September 2020| 21In its meeting on December 19, 2019, the Board of Directors of Valmet decided to use the authorization granted by the Annual General Meeting held on March 21, 2019 to acquire the Company's own shares. Based on the authorization, the Board decided to initiate a fixed-term share buy-back program for the purpose of acquiring the Company's own shares to meet part of the obligations arising from the LTI Plan and the Restricted Shares Pool incentive plans. The share acquisitions began on February 10, 2020 and ended on February 24, 2020. The total number of acquired shares was 270,000. The shares were acquired at market price in public trading on Nasdaq Helsinki Ltd.

Valmet's Interim Review , January-September 2020| 22Risks and business uncertainties Valmet's operations are affected by various strategic, financial, operational and hazard risks. Valmet takes measures to exploit emerging opportunities and to limit the adverse effects of potential threats. The assessment of risks related to sustainable development holds an important role in risk management. If such threats materialized, they could have material adverse effects on Valmet's business, financial situation and operating result, or on the value of shares and other securities. The objective of Valmet's risk management is to ensure the implementation of an effective and successful strategy for achieving both long- and short-term goals. The task of Valmet's management is to regulate risk appetite. In assessing risks, Valmet takes into consideration the probability of the risks and their estimated impact on net sales and financial results. Valmet's management estimates that the Company's overall risk level is currently manageable in proportion to the scope of its operations and the practical measures available for managing these risks. Financial uncertainty in the global economy, coupled with fluctuations in exchange rates and tightening financial market regulations, may have an adverse effect on the availability of financing from banks and capital markets and could reduce the investment appetite of Valmet's customers. Valmet estimates that the high proportion of business derived from stable business (Services and Automation) and the geographical diversification will reduce the possible negative effects that market uncertainties may have. If global economic growth weakens, it might have adverse effects on new projects under negotiation or on projects in the order backlog. Some projects may be postponed, suspended, or canceled. In the case of long-term delivery projects, initial customer advance payments are typically 10-30 percent of the value of the project, and customers make progress payments as the project is implemented. This significantly decreases the risks and financing requirements related to Valmet's projects. Valmet continually assesses its customers' creditworthiness and their ability to meet their obligations. As a rule, Valmet does not finance customer projects. If economic growth slows down significantly, the markets for Valmet's products may shrink, which may lead to, for example, tougher price competition. Changes and uncertainty in future regulation and legislation can also have critical effects, especially on the energy business. Large fluctuations in energy prices can affect the global economy. These fluctuations can also affect Valmet and its customers, especially in the energy business. Changes in labor costs and the prices of raw materials and components can affect Valmet's profitability. Wage inflation is continuing, but Valmet's goal is to offset this at least partly through increased productivity and strict price discipline. It is possible, however, that tough competition in some product categories will make it difficult to pass on cost increases to product prices. On the other hand, some of Valmet's customers are raw material producers and their ability to operate and invest may be enhanced by strengthening commodity prices and hampered by declining commodity prices. To ensure a high level of quality in both production and services, it is important to sustain a high level of competence and talent availability. This includes, for example, maintaining efficient recruitment programs, utilization of existing talent and sharing knowledge globally. Through acquisitions, Valmet may become exposed to risks associated with new markets and business environments. The actual acquisition process also includes risks. Other risks associated with acquisitions Valmet's Interim Review , January-September 2020| 23include, but are not limited to, integration of the acquired business, increased financial risk exposure, retention of key personnel and achieving the targets set for the acquired business. Management of project business risks important An important part of Valmet's business consists of project business. Pulp business projects in particular can be large, thus project-specific risk management is crucial. Key risks related to projects are project cost estimation, scheduling, project risk management, quality and performance risks, and materials management risks. Risk analysis shall, as a minimum, take place for all significant project quotations. The work concerning threat and opportunity assessment continues during the execution phase of the project. Risk management is based on careful planning and continuous, systematic monitoring and evaluation. Project risks are managed by improving and continuously developing project management processes and the related systems. There may be changes in the competitive situation of Valmet's individual businesses, such as the emergence of new, cost-effective competition in the markets. Valmet can safeguard its market position by developing its products and services, and through good customer service and local presence. Availability of financing crucial Securing the continuity of Valmet's operations requires sufficient available funding under all circumstances. Valmet estimates that its liquid cash assets and committed credit limits are sufficient to secure its immediate liquidity and to ensure the flexibility of financing. The average maturity of Valmet's non-current debt, excluding lease liabilities, is 2.5 years. Loan facilities include customary covenants, and Valmet is in clear compliance with the covenants at the balance sheet date. Net working capital and capital expenditure levels have a key impact on the adequacy of Valmet's financing. Setting aside investments into the renewal of the ERP system, Valmet does not expect any significant increase in annual capital expenditure and estimates that it is well-positioned to keep capital expenditure at the level of total depreciation. Of the financial risks that affect Valmet's profit, currency exchange rate risks are among the most substantial. Exchange rate changes can affect Valmet's business, although the wide geographical scope of the Company's operations reduces the impact of any individual currency. Economic insecurity typically increases exchange rate fluctuations. Valmet hedges its currency exposures linked to firm delivery and purchase agreements. Changes in legislation and the way authorities interpret regulation, for example regarding taxation, can also have an impact on Valmet's financials. As at September 30, 2020 , Valmet had EUR 680 million (EUR 685 million ) of goodwill on its statement of financial position. Valmet assesses the value of its goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate that a risk of impairment exists. Valmet has not identified any indications of impairment during the reporting period. The principles used for impairment testing are presented in the Financial Statements. COVID-19 pandemic Depending on the success in suppressing the COVID-19 pandemic and in case the outbreak will be further prolonged, there could be further adverse impact on Valmet's operations, customer investment activity, project deliveries, supply chain and availability of financing for both Valmet and its customers. Valmet currently has a large order backlog, strong balance sheet and liquidity coupled with a flexible organization, Valmet's Interim Review , January-September 2020| 24and a structured way to operate in changing circumstances. This will aid Valmet in mitigating the global challenges caused by COVID-19. Events after the reporting period On October 12, 2020, Valmet announced that it sustains its goal to merge Valmet and Neles despite Neles' Board of Directors' negative response to Valmet's proposal, which Neles had announced on the same day. On October 13, 2020, Valmet issued a guidance for 2020, in which Valmet estimates that net sales in 2020 will remain at the previous year's level in comparison with 2019 (EUR 3,547 million) and Comparable EBITA in 2020 will increase in comparison with 2019 (EUR 316 million). On October 15, 2020, Valmet announced that it has completed the acquisition of PMP Group in Poland, effective as of October 1, 2020, following the agreement that was announced on September 11, 2020. PMP Group is a provider of technologies and services for the paper industry. The enterprise value of the acquisition is approximately EUR 64 million, plus a conditional and capped earn-out component. The acquired business becomes a part of Valmet's Paper business line. PMP Group supplies process technologies and services for tissue, board and paper machines globally, focusing on small and medium- sized tissue machines and board and paper machine rebuilds. The net sales of the company were approximately EUR 70 million in the fiscal year 2019. The company employs about 650 people in Poland, China, USA and Italy. PMP will be included in Valmet's financial reporting for the first time in Valmet's fourth quarter financial reporting 2020. There have been no other subsequent events after the review period that required recognition or disclosure. Guidance for 2020 unchanged Valmet reiterates its guidance issued on October 13, 2020, in which Valmet estimates that net sales in 2020 will remain at the previous year's level in comparison with 2019 (EUR 3,547 million) and Comparable EBITA in 2020 will increase in comparison with 2019 (EUR 316 million). Short-term outlook General economic outlook according to IMF The global economy is climbing out from the depths to which it had plummeted during the Great Lockdown in April. But with the COVID-19 pandemic continuing to spread, many countries have slowed reopening and some are reinstating partial lockdowns. While recovery in China has been faster than expected, the global economy's long ascent back to pre-pandemic levels of activity remains prone to setbacks. Global growth is projected at -4.4 percent in 2020, a less severe contraction than in IMF's June 2020 forecast. For 2021, the growth forecast is 5.2 percent, and the level of global GDP in 2021 is expected to be a modest 0.6 percent above that of 2019. After the rebound in 2021, global growth is expected to gradually slow to about 3.5 percent into the medium term. The uncertainty surrounding the projection is unusually large, as the forecast rests on public health and economic factors that are inherently difficult to predict.

Valmet Oyj is domiciled in Helsinki, and its registered address is Keilasatama 5, 02150 Espoo, Finland. The Company's shares are listed on Nasdaq Helsinki Ltd. These condensed consolidated interim financial statements were approved for issue on October 27, 2020 . Basis of presentation These condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 - Interim financial reporting and in conformity with IFRS as adopted by the European Union. The financial information presented in these condensed consolidated interim financial statements has not been audited. These condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Group's annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 , which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS. Valmet Group has applied new standards and interpretations published by IASB that are effective for the first time for financial reporting periods commencing on January 1, 2020 . These standards and interpretations did not have a material impact on the results or financial position of the Group, or the presentation of these condensed consolidated interim financial statements. Except for the above, the accounting policies applied in the preparation of these condensed consolidated interim financial statements are consistent with those followed in the preparation of the Group's annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 . In these condensed consolidated interim financial statements, the figures are presented in million euros subject to rounding, which may cause some rounding inaccuracies in aggregate column and row totals. Key exchange rates Average rates Period-end rates Q1-Q3/2020 Review , January-September 2020| 33Reporting segments and geographic information The Group's Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) is the President and CEO of Valmet. Valmet's four business lines are highly integrated through complementing product and service offerings and joint customer projects. Thus, the operations and profitability of Valmet is reported as a single reportable segment with the key operative decisions being made by the CODM at the Valmet Group level. One key indicator of performance reviewed is Earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (EBITA). Performance is also assessed through Comparable EBITA, i.e. with EBITA excluding certain items of income and expense that reduce the comparability of the Group's performance from one period to another. The alternative performance measures of EBITA and Comparable EBITA are published by Valmet as part of regulated financial information to enable users of the financial information to prepare more meaningful analysis on Valmet's performance. Items affecting comparability consist of income and expenses arising from activities that amend the capacity of Valmet's operations, such as restructuring costs and gains or losses on sale of businesses or non-current assets, income and expenses incurred outside Valmet's normal course of business, such as impairment charges and gains or losses recorded as a result of settlement payments to/from third parties (e.g. penalties incurred as a result of tax audits or settlements to closed law suits) as well as income and expenses arising from changes in legislation expected to affect Valmet temporarily only (e.g. customs or other tariffs imposed by authorities on Valmet's products).

Entity-wide information Valmet has operations globally in over 35 countries . Measured by net sales, the top three countries in January-September 2020 were the USA, Brazil and China, which together accounted for 37 percent of total net sales. In January-September 2019 , the top three countries were the USA, China and Finland, which together accounted for 41 percent of total net sales.

Paper, and Pulp and Energy business lines' revenue is derived from large long-term capital projects, for which revenue is mostly recognized over time based on the cost-to-cost method. Service business line's revenue arises from large volume of short-term contracts with relatively low individual value, for which revenue is mainly recognized at a point in time. Automation business line's revenue consists of long-term contracts and short-term service contracts. The nature of long-term contracts, and therefore also the revenue recognition method, is similar to capital projects although with average contract values being lower. Revenue for short-term service contracts is recognized at a point in time. Nature of revenue in each area in any given reporting period is driven by volume and size of ongoing capital projects.

During the reporting period Valmet had not entered into any material contracts where the period between when Valmet transfers a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or more. Neither were there any ongoing projects from previous reporting periods for which the former would apply. The creditworthiness of a customer is verified before entering into a contract. However, if a risk of non- payment arises after contract inception, the probability of collection of consideration is re-evaluated and if assessed improbable, recognition of revenue is discontinued. An allowance for non-collectability of open receivables and contract assets is established as concluded appropriate. Valmet receives payments from customers based on invoicing schedules as set out in the customer contracts. Changes in contract assets and liabilities are due to Valmet's performance under the contracts. Amounts due from customers under revenue contracts primarily relate to Valmet's right to consideration Unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements Valmet's Interim Review , January-September 2020| 36for work completed but not yet invoiced at the reporting date. These assets are transferred to trade receivables when right to consideration becomes unconditional, which is typically at the time when Valmet has contractual right to issue an invoice. Significant part of amounts due to customers relate to advance consideration received from customer in long-term capital contracts for which revenue is recognized over time. These amounts are recognized as revenue as (or when) Valmet performs under the contracts. Following tables provide specification of movements in amounts due from customers under revenue contracts and amounts due to customers under revenue contracts over the reporting period. Revenue recognized in the period also includes revenue recognized related to performance obligations satisfied in previous periods, the amount of which however is insignificant.
