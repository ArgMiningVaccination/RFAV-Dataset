What does it all mean? All the different terms can get confusing, we know! So, we created this 5-minute Rupa Health Holistic Medicine Glossary Guide to help you on your journey. Osteopathic Medicine (DO) A fully licensed physician with full medical practice rights. A DO has nearly identical training to MDs and is a highly regulated profession with full practice rights in the US, including surgery and more. Naturopathic Medicine (ND) A medical license. Other than Osteopathic Medicine, Naturopathic Medicine is the only other term in this list that is an official medical degree that a person can obtain. A Naturopathic Doctor is a person with a specific degree and licensure, and it is a highly regulated term. However, they have significantly fewer practice rights than an MD and DO in the United States. They are regulated state-by-state, and not all states license NDs. Functional Medicine A post graduate certification Functional medicine is an individualized root cause medicine approach to healthcare. These practitioners consider factors like diet, genetics, hormonal changes, and other lifestyle components as potential causes and treatments for patients' diseases. To be eligible for certification as a functional medicine practitioner, you must have a master's degree in a health-related field with one of the following credentials: Medical Doctor, Doctor of Osteopathy, Doctor of Chiropractic (DC), Naturopathic Doctor (ND), Dentist, Nurse Practitioner (NP), Acupuncturist (LAc), Pharmacist, mental health professionals, or an equivalent degree from countries outside of the US. Physician Assistant (PA), Registered Nurse (RN), Registered Dietitian (RD), Occupational Therapist (OT), and Physical Therapist (PT) must hold at least a bachelor's level degree in their field as long as their education was completed prior to the entry-level education change. Integrative Medicine Board certification for doctors and/or an approach to medicine. - A fellowship and board certification obtained by an MD / DO from an accredited medical school - A style of practicing medicine that is \"healing-oriented,\" \"takes account of the whole person, including all aspects of lifestyle,\" and incorporates alternative modalities How is Functional Medicine Different from Integrative Medicine? Many people use the terms interchangeably, and they're similar but slightly different. Both are focused on getting to the root cause, are holistic and individualized, and prioritize lifestyle, nutritional, and behavioral changes over pharmaceuticals.The difference is with the approach to getting to the root cause diagnosis. Integrative medicine is a board-certified fellowship that MDs and DOs can take and obtain as an official credential. Functional medicine offers both fellowships and post-graduate certifications for post-graduate medical professionals. Functional Nutrition A post-graduate certification for Nutritionist that teaches a whole-body approach. It focuses on therapeutic food plans, micronutrient testing, supplement protocols, and mind-body modalities such as meditation, yoga, breathing techniques, and other lifestyle-oriented coaching practices to support behavior change. Health Coach Health Coaches commonly work in Integrative or Functional Medicine clinics and provide support and accountability to patients after diagnosis. To practice as a health coach, you must be certified by the National Board for Health and Wellness Coaching (NBHWC). Root Cause Medicine Root Cause Medicine focuses on the root cause of disease, just like Functional and Integrative Medicine. It is not a certification but is commonly used interchangeably with Functional and Integrative medicine. Many Health Care Providers who are not Certified in Functional or Integrative Medicine but still focus on \"root cause\" will label themselves as a root cause practitioner. Alternative Medicine Alternative Medicine is any form of \"medicine\" that is outside traditional (allopathic) Western medicine. It spans a wide array and includes both licensed practitioners (Naturopathic Physicians, Acupuncturists, Chiropractors, etc.) and other healthcare modalities like reiki, energy healing, herbalism, etc. Homeopathic Medicine A specific approach to healing. Homeopathy is a medical system based on the belief that the body can cure itself. There are no official \"homeopathic doctors\" in the United States; however, Naturopathic Doctors have training in this. Homeopathy was developed in the late 1700s in Germany. It's common in many European countries, but it's not quite as popular in the United States. Those who practice it use tiny amounts of natural substances, like plants and minerals, to stimulate the healing process. Holistic Medicine An approach to health and healing. Holistic medicine is more of a mindset and an approach to treating a patient rather than an actual type of medicine. There is no licensing or credentialing to become a \"holistic doctor .\" Holistic medicine is an umbrella term that all of the above titles we have discussed can fall under. "}
