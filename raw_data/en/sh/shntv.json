In 2008, I received my Masters in Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine from the New England School of Acupuncture, one of the top 3 acupuncture schools in the nation. Studying in Boston gave me exposure to cutting edge research and educators in integrative healthcare through NESA's relationships with Harvard's Osher Center for Integrative Medicine and Tufts University School of Medicine. As part of my training to be an acupuncturist, I have worked in both major city hospitals and small inner city clinics, with pediatric and adult populations for a total of 10 clinical rotations and 720 training hours.

She met her husband of over 20yrs working on ambulances together. In 2001, she moved to a Level 1 Trauma ER in Downtown Denver woking as a Trauma Tech. After 10yrs or so, she was ready to move on to helping people in different ways. While she believes that we are great at putting people's bodies back together, she saw a real lack of support for mental/emotional health in the healthcare setting. After starting her family of two boys and moving to the mountains above Boulder, she faced some health set backs of her own and was introduced to a modality called RTT (Rapid Transformational Therapy). It created such an incredible impact in her own life and physical health, she knew this was the path she had been searching for since leaving the ER. She was certified as a Rapid Transformational Therapy Practitioner in 2020 and has loved every minute of her work. RTT helps the client to uncover the subconscious limiting beliefs and habits that is running in the background of our day to day life. And since our subconscious rules about 95% of our thoughts, feelings, reactions, and triggers, it's vital that we understand what exactly our subconscious is holding on to and why, especially when we want to establish changes in our life without the struggle. She uses tools like light hypnosis to quickly and efficiently go directly to the source to reveal and heal the subconscious \"safety programing\" running in the background that's holding us back. It's so efficient, incredibly most clients only need 1-3 sessions. If you'd like to learn more or wonder if RTT could help you finally make the changes you have been wanting in life, Amy offers Free Discovery calls.
