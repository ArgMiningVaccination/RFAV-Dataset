But ignorance and embarrassment are often to blame.", "sitename": "The Guardian", "date": "2002-01-27", "cleaned_text": "Mine is a spheroid measuring 37mm by 43mm by 31mm which means it has roughly the dimensions of a misshapen, oversized walnut. It weighs 22g - about the weight of a packet of crisps after you've taken a decent handful. These details are important because, unlike other sex organs (and yes, we are talking about a sex organ), in this case, size does matter. Pause for much head scratching. Surveys suggest that only one in eight of you will know what I'm on about. Male readers, fret not. In case you didn't check the byline, I'm not talking about that much-discussed but frequently elusive female sex organ. (Unfortunately, for all concerned, that particular item is generally somewhat smaller than a walnut.) No, I'm talking about the prostate gland, a little secretion factory located beneath the bladder against the rectum. In research conducted by the Prostate [Cancer](https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer) Charity (PCC), only 12 per cent of respondents knew its function - that is to produce some of the fluids that, along with sperm, go to make up semen. To be honest, despite having written about men's health for a few years now, I only found out myself recently. The point is I'd never really thought about the thing until somebody asked me to. And ignorance like this is a killer. As men get older, testosterone causes the prostate to grow. The walnut can become an orange. The effect of that pressing against your urethra is obvious - frequent, trickly peeing. By the age of 80, four out of five men are troubled by this - an enlarged prostate is a normal part of ageing and not usually life-threatening, but any growth still needs to be viewed seriously for the obvious reason that it could be cancer. Especially as the early symptoms of prostate cancer are similar to those of benign prostate problems. Prostate cancer kills 700 men every month. In men under 60, the age-group in which the disease is most aggressive, rates have increased by 50 per cent in 20 years, yet in the PCC survey, 40 per cent of respondents didn't realise that frequent peeing could be a symptom of the disease. Certainly Sheffield city councillor Andrew White wasn't aware of this. Neither, apparently, was his doctor. 'I was 44 years old and getting up six times a night to urinate,' Andrew recalls. 'Then I got a pain in the groin. I was a welder then and thought I'd pulled a muscle at work. My doctor treated me for cystitis and a groin strain. But over Christmas I was peeing every 20 minutes or so and the groin was getting worse. I went back to the doctor. He gave me a sick note because I couldn't work. Again, he put it down to a groin strain. Two weeks later I went back again and he gave me another sick note.' It was only after this third visit that Andrew's GP twigged the possible cause. He called Andrew back for tests and then referred him to a consultant urologist. After a biopsy, prostate cancer was diagnosed. He had radiotherapy and, to suppress testosterone levels, hormone treatment. Eight years later, Andrew has pushed a motion through Sheffield City Council calling on the government to introduce prostate screening for men over 50. In about half of cases, prostate cancer is not usually diagnosed until it is in an advanced state and traditionally survival rates after five years have been low - around 50 per cent. But, as Professor Tim Oliver revealed at the Men's Health Forum's recent conference, things could improve considerably in the future. 'For 50 years we have felt that surgery and the chemical suppression of hormones were the only options,' Professor Oliver says, 'but trials in progress suggest it is increasingly safe to consider intermittent treatment with hormones. This reduces side-effects and enhances quality of life. I believe we could double survival rates using this technique.' So, if treatment is improving is there a case, as Andrew White argues, for screening men to catch any cancer sooner rather than later? One of the reasons that organisations such as the Prostate Cancer Charity are not, currently, in favour of screening is that diagnostic tests are still rather primitive. The digital rectal examination (DRE), for example, may sound like the latest in hi-tech procedures but it is nothing more - or, worse luck, less - than a finger up the bottom. Because of the location of the prostate, a skilled doctor can get a good sense of its size from such an inspection. But, the anecdotal evidence is that doctors are as unenthusiastic about giving a DRE as patients are about receiving one. Dr Ian Banks, chair of the Men's Health Forum, says: 'When I speak at conferences I often ask male GPs how many of them have told a male patient that he needs a DRE but that they would do it at the next appointment. Half of them put their hands up. I suspect they are the honest half.' Indeed. You also wonder how many of those men never go and see a GP again. So, embarrassment can kill as well as ignorance. However, I can exclusively reveal, there's really nothing to a DRE. Before the digit dives, more gel is slapped around than at a hairdresser's dinner party with the result that before you can say, 'Is it in yet?', the deed has been done. Anyway, the DRE is only a guide and recently more scientific ways have been developed to measure the gland including ultrasound scans and blood tests. The PSA (Prostate Specific Anitgen) test measures a specific prostate antigen in the blood; raised levels suggest an enlarged gland and could be used in prostate cancer screening. But, says the PCC's Chris Hiley, 'the PSA needs careful interpretation as it can give ambiguous results especially in the lower range of abnormal values. It may show a prostate problem, but not cancer or be normal even when cancer is present, so it always requires follow-up. If, in the future, a more effective PSA test or something measuring a different marker more accurately became available I'd be more in favour of screening, especially in younger men in whom the disease is most aggressive.' In the meantime, men must screen themselves - if you have some symptoms, see a doctor and be persistent. Even if, as in most cases, the growth of the prostate is benign, it can, if it is causing problems, be shrunk using drugs or natural therapies. And on the basis that prevention may be preferable to a DRE, there are also several things men can do to keep their prostates small and healthy, things that may help their sex lives, too. Lycopene, an antioxidant found in tomatoes, including processed ones like tomato sauce, can lower PSA. A prostate-friendly diet would also be high in vitamin B6 and the minerals zinc and selenium. (Zinc is found in shellfish, yogurt, beans, lean meat and seeds, including pine, sunflower and particularly pumpkin.) Fatty acids from linseeds and oily fish, such as sardines and salmon may also be helpful. The prostate contracts during orgasm and some men like to have it stimulated during sex. Chris Meletis of the National College of Naturopathic Medicine in the USA calls it 'the forgotten sex organ'. He says, 'Researchers believe sensations that occur in it during ejaculation heighten orgasmic feelings. It also makes vital contributions to sperm function.' Erectile dysfunction (or impotence) can be a symptom of prostate cancer - the disease is one of the specific medical conditions for which Viagra can be prescribed - and an enlarged prostate will hamper your sex life in a number of ways. For a start, you may well be tired from getting up to pee all night. 'Fatigue and sexual arousal are incongruent,' says Meletis, 'while if the bladder is full, mood and orgasm are hampered. The pressure on the bladder during sex can be distracting. Men also feel a build-up of tension in the prostate region as their bodies get excited which can be uncomfortable for men with enlarged prostates.' Given all that, perhaps it should come as no surprise that many traditional remedies for low libido and impotence actually effect the prostate. Two natural treatments which have some research evidence to support them are the herb saw palmetto, which is the most popular complementary treatment for prostate problems in the USA, and pygeum, the extract of the bark of an African evergreen tree. They can both prevent testosterone converting into dihydrotestosterone (or DHT), the form of the hormone that appears to cause the prostate to grow. US research also suggests that saw palmetto is at least as effective as drugs in treating people with benign enlarged prostates and has none of the side effects such as loss of libido. One side effect it does have, though, is that it can artificially lower a PSA test reading. Perhaps the easiest natural prostate therapy to get hold of is the humble stinging nettle. Available as tea or freeze-dried and very nice in soup. Not recommended raw.
