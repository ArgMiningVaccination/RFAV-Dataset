Ayurveda is an intelligent, ancient wisdom that supports a healthy and radiant life. It is one of the world's first holistic healing systems from India dating back about 5,000 years. 'Ayu' means life and 'veda' means knowledge. Thus, it is the knowledge of life. It is a vast body of knowledge that teaches individuals how to thrive with their unique mind-body type. We are all different and thus our diet, exercise, and lifestyle routines should be individualized and change with the season. Individual Consultations Are you struggling with gas, bloat or indigestion? Do you have difficulty sleeping? Are you struggling with constipation or loose stools? Do you have skin issues? Acne, psoriasis, eczema? Do you experience hormonal issues and issues related to your menses? Are you planning to conceive within the next year? Are you experiencing issues with conception right now? Are you busy, stressed or burnt out from life? Are you exhausted trying to balance a career, relationships and your health? Ayurveda understands that mind, body + spirit are connected, and thus it is impossible to individually treat imbalance in a vacuum. Rather, the whole being must be taken into account. I use a holistic approach drawing from Ayurvedic, yogic and spiritual wisdom to offer you an integrative approach so that you can restore balance and feel whole. During an individual consultation, we uncover where imbalance stems from, and craft a wellness plan to restore balance. There are many natural healing modalities we can utilize such as proper diet, exercise, self-care techniques, yoga, breathing, meditation, aromatherapy and herbs. My passion is to support you on your journey, and help you radiate from the inside out. I have successfully guided others to bring their mind, body + spirit into balance so that they feel vibrant and well. I know I can help you, too! Are you ready to take ownership of your well-being, build mind-body awareness and cultivate a healthy relationship with yourself? Shri Wellness is here to support you on your journey toward the radiant and abundant life you have always dreamed of. Set up a complimentary conversation to discuss where you see yourself and what is holding you back. Shri Wellness is based in Denver, Colorado but works with clients remotely worldwide at this time. Clients seen by appointment only. "}
