Ripple, Department of Forest Ecosystems and Society, Oregon State Uni- versity, Corvallis, OR of the world's vertebrates have experienced large population and geographic range declines due to anthropogenic threats that put them at risk of extinction. The largest vertebrates, dened as megafauna, are especially vulnerable. We analyzed how human activities are impacting the conservation status of megafauna within six classes: mammals, ray-nned sh, cartilaginous sh, amphibians, birds, and rep- tiles. We identied a total of 362 extant megafauna species. We found that 70% of megafauna species with sucient information are decreasing and 59% are threatened with extinction. Surprisingly, direct harvesting of megafauna for human consumption of meat or body parts is the largest individual threat to each of the classes exam- ined, and a threat for 98% (159/162) of threatened species with threat data available. Therefore, minimizing the direct killing of the world's largest vertebrates is a priority conservation strategy that might save many of these iconic species and the functions and services they provide.

The main causes of verte- brate biodiversity declines are overexploitation and habitat loss associated with an increasing human population and per capita resource use (Homann et al., 2010; Maxwell, Fuller, Brooks, & Watson, 2016; Ripple et al. 2017a).

The ongoing biodiversity crisis has prompted researchers to explore how species' life history traits relate to their threat status (Dirzo et al., 2014). Although it is known that the largest species of terrestrial mammals are at a high risk of extinction (Ripple et al., 2015, 2016; Smith, Smith, Lyons, & Payne, 2018), especially from anthropogenic sources, threats to megafauna across all major classes of ver- tebrates taken together have not been fully considered (Ripple et al., 2017b). Here, we construct a list of species that qualify as megafauna based on new criteria of body size thresholds for six classes of vertebrates. Specically, we dened megafauna as vertebrate species that are unusually large compared with other species in the same class. This approach builds on published denitions of megafauna that are based mostly on terrestrial mammals from the Pleistocene (Supporting Infor- mation Table S1; Martin & Klein, 1989). In doing so, the megafauna concept becomes context dependent and not xed on one specic minimum body size or mass for all taxa (Hansen & Galetti, 2009). Motivated by previously published thresholds, which mostly ranged between 40 and 100 kg (Sup- porting Information Table S1), we dene mass thresholds for megafauna separately for each class. Thus, we considered megafauna to be all species 100 kg for mammals, ray-nned sh, and cartilaginous sh, and all species 40 kg for amphib- ians, birds, and reptiles, because they have smaller body sizes, on average, compared with large mammals and sh. These new megafauna mass thresholds extend the num- ber and diversity of species included as megafauna, thereby allowing for a broader analysis of the status and ecological eects of the world's largest vertebrates. Under this frame- work, we herein provide an analysis of the status, trends, and key threats to megafauna, and report on the ecological con- sequences of their decline. We end by outlining priority con- servation strategies to help ensure the survival of the Earth's remaining megafauna in marine, freshwater, and terrestrial ecosystems. By considering megafauna across classes, our analysis highlights similarities for the threats faced by species that dier geographically, taxonomically, and in their habitats. 2METHODS We obtained body mass data from the Amniote database for mammals, reptiles, and birds (Myhrvold et al., 2015), and acquired body lengths from FishBase for ray-nned and cartilaginous sh (Froese & Pauly, 2000) and AmphibiaWeb for amphibians (AmphibiaWeb, 2016). Using the 1,735 sh species with known maximum lengths and masses in FishBase, we modeled the relationship between length andmass (both log transformed) with a generalized additive model, which allows for nonlinearity. We used this model to predict masses for all species in FishBase with known maximum lengths and unknown masses. For amphibians, we used the allometric equations given in Pough (1980) to predict masses from total and snout-to-vent lengths given in AmphibiaWeb species accounts. After determining body masses, we restricted our analysis to only those species that met our megafauna criteria ( 100 kg for mammals and sh and40 kg for birds, amphibians, and reptiles). We merged the body mass data with information on species-level extinction risk from the IUCN Red List (ver. 2018.1) using species' scientic names and taxonomic synonyms. Species not found in the IUCN Red List, because they have yet to be assessed, were listed separately but excluded from further analysis. We also excluded extinct (EX), extinct in the wild (EW), and data-decient (DD) species from most of the analysis, focusing only on those classied as critically endangered (CR), endangered (EN), vulnerable (VU), near threatened (NT), or least concern (LC). We did, however, calculate the percentages of megafauna and all vertebrates that have gone extinct since 1500 CE (the timeframe used in the IUCN Red List). Lastly, we grouped the species by class for the following classes: ray-nned sh (Actinopterygii), cartilaginous sh (Chondrichthyes), birds, mammals, reptiles, and amphibians. Other minor sh classes contained no species with masses 100 kg and thus were only included in the results for all vertebrates together. We determined the percentages of species threatened and decreasing for both species classied as megafauna and for all vertebrates with available data. We also estimated the percentages of megafauna species by class that are threatened within various ecosystem types as dened by the IUCN Red List (Marine, Freshwater, and Terrestrial). The threats faced by species were assessed using coded information from the IUCN Red List threats classica- tion scheme (IUCN, 2018). Only threatened species with coded threat information available were included in this portion of the analysis. To separate threats related to live- stock/aquaculture and crops, and those related to harvesting and logging, we split two of the top-level threats categories. Specically, we split the \"Agriculture & aquaculture\" cate- gory (2) into agricultural perennial \"Hunting & terrestrial and 5.3: \"Logging & wood harvesting\"). Finally, we manually recorded the reasons for harvesting of each megafauna species based on information in the IUCN Red List fact sheets and Arkive (2018).RIPPLE ET AL . 3o f1 0 3RESULTS A total of 362 extant species qualied as megafauna based on our taxonomy-based size thresholds (Supporting Informa- tion Tables S2-S4). We excluded 77 species (38 mammals, 16 ray-nned sh, 6 reptiles, and 17 cartilaginous sh) from subsequent analyses (unless otherwise noted) because they were either extinct in the wild (EW; two species), extinct (EX; seven species), data decient (DD; 48 species), or not listed in the IUCN Red List (20 species) (Supporting Informa- tion Table S3). Close to half of the remaining 292 megafauna species were mammals ( n=140), n=1) (Supporting Information Table S2). Megafauna species are more threatened and have a rel- atively higher percentage of decreasing populations than all vertebrates together. Of the 39,493 (non-DD/EW/EX) vertebrate species in the IUCN Red List, 21% are cata- logued as threatened and 46% have decreasing populations (Figure 1, Supporting Information Table S4). In contrast, of the 292 megafauna species, 70% have decreasing popula- tions and 59% are threatened (Figure 1). Generally, freshwa- ter ecosystems contain the highest proportion of threatened megafauna, while marine systems contain a lower proportion of threatened megafauna (Supporting Information Figure S1). Notably, the top-ranked threat within each megafauna class was direct harvesting by humans, although there were typ- ically multiple co-occurring threats, mostly related to habi- tat degradation (Figure 2). Meat consumption was the most common motive for harvesting megafauna for all classes except reptiles where harvesting eggs was ranked on top (Figure 3). Other leading reasons for harvesting megafauna included medicinal use, unintended bycatch in sheries and trapping, live trade, and various other uses of body parts such as skins and ns (Figure 3). Over half (64%) of the threatened megafauna were listed by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) because of threats involving global trade in these species (Supporting Informa- tion Table S5). Since 1500 CE, 2% of assessed megafauna species have gone extinct compared to 0.8% of all assessed vertebrates (Supporting Information Table S4). Interestingly, within each of the six vertebrate classes, some of the largest individual species were threatened with extinction (Figure 4, Supporting Information Table S2). 4DISCUSSION Our results suggest that we are in the process of eating the world's megafauna to extinction. Megafauna are heavily exploited for human consumption (Figure 3) and are, on aver- age, 2.75 times more likely to be threatened by extinction thanother vertebrate species that have been assessed by the IUCN (and are not DD, EW, or EX) (Supporting Information Table S4). This means that seven out of 10 of our largest and most iconic fauna will experience further population declines in the near future, and three out of ve could go extinct. Declines of the largest vertebrate species will jeopardize ecosystem ser- vices to humans and generate cascading evolutionary and eco- logical eects on other species and processes (Estes 2011; Estes, Heithaus, McCauley, Pleistocene extinctions reinforce our ndings regard- ing the elevated extinction risk of extant megafauna. Since the late Pleistocene, humans have emerged as a \"super-predator\" (Darimont, Fox, Bryan, & Reimchen, 2015), specializing in killing prey larger than their individual body mass, similar to gray wolves ( Canis lupus ) and orcas ( Orcinus orca ). the wake of growing human populations, their increased geo- graphic range, and improved tool use, many large terrestrial mammals went extinct during the late Pleistocene (Sandom, Faurby, Sandel, & Svenning, 2014). The strong extinction bias toward species of large size is highly unusual and unmatched over the prior 65 million years (Smith et al., 2018). Humans, commonly using projectile weapons, dier from other preda- tors of large prey, such as lions ( Panthera leo ) and wolves, in their ability to cause death at a distance (Worm, 2015). Attacking from a safe distance enables the tackling of very large, dangerous prey with much less risk to the predator, com- pared with the physical combat required for all non-human predators on land and sea. In addition, the limitation of preda- tor numbers through natural prey availability does not hold for humans, whose global population grows disproportion- ately to its sustainability because of our ability to produce food. The impact of the human appetite for large prey was rst felt on land with the extinction of the Pleistocene megafauna in terrestrial systems, and more recently extended to marine and freshwater ecosystems as humans enhanced their shing skills with sophisticated technology (Jackson et al., 2001). Histor- ically, human hunters have preferentially targeted large prey items as a way of signaling their tness - a pattern that may be continuing today in the form of trophy hunting (Darimont, Codding, & Hawkes, 2017). Following this habitual (or pos- sibly hard-wired) pattern of humans focusing on the largest size classes in our prey spectrum, direct harvesting for meat or egg consumption is still a dominant threat for all megafauna classes (Figures 2 and 3). The current trend is consistent with optimal foraging theory, which predicts that predators attempt to gain the most benet (e.g., large vulnerable prey) at the least cost (Stephens & Krebs, 1986). But in today's world, the reasons for continuing such a practice are unclear, because the vast majority of human food is produced by agriculture and aquaculture, and most \"wild\" meat likely comes from smaller bodied species, which are more plentiful. Despite this4o f1 0 RIPPLE FIGURE 1 Megafauna extinction risk and trends. Shown are percentages of species classied as (a) threatened (IUCN Red List Category Vulnerable, Endangered, or Critically Endangered) and (b) with decreasing population trend. Data are separated by megafauna (dark green) versus al l vertebrate species (blue) in each class, and for all vertebrates combined (IUCN, 2018). Numbers of megafauna species in each class followed by numbers of all IUCN-assessed species in each class are indicated at the bottom of each panel. Only species with IUCN Red List category and population trend data are counted for panels (a) and (b), respectively. Megafauna are dened here as species with 100 kg body mass for mammals, ray-nned sh, and cartilaginous sh, and 40 kg for amphibians, birds, and reptiles pattern, humanity's predatory behavior can cause declines in megafauna because a given rate of exploitation will reduce populations of large animals more quickly, because on aver- age, they tend to be less abundant and productive, than smaller species. Although consideration should be given to the fact that megafauna can be an important food source for some peo- ple in developing countries, bushmeat hunting for food and medicinal products may harvest millions of tonnes of animal biomass per year in the southern hemisphere (Cawthorn & Homan, 2015), and worldwide, threatens over 300 terres- trial mammal species with extinction, some of which are large size (Ripple et al., 2016). In certain cases, if people no longer eat wild meat for subsistence, they may need to obtain suf-cient nutrients from agricultural sources that could result in other impacts to habitats. The surge in demand for Asian tradi- tional medicinal products also exert heavy tolls on the largest species, which are often the most appealing, for various rea- sons (Ellis, 2013). There is good reason to raise further awareness of the declining status of large vertebrates. Nine megafauna species went extinct or became extinct in the wild between the 1760s and 2012, and in each case this was due to excessive hunting or a combination of hunting and habitat degradation (Supporting Information Table S6). The reasons for hunting these species to extinction were for the acquisition of meat for consump- tion or for body parts such as skins, horns, organs, and antlersRIPPLE ET AL . 5o f1 0 Rayfinned fish ( = 29) Reptiles ( n = 20)All megafauna ( n = 162) Cartilaginous fish ( n = 38) Mammals ( threatened species FIGURE 2 Current threats to megafauna. Shown are percentages of threatened megafauna species in each class facing dierent types of threats. We used the top-level coded threat data on species Red List fact sheet pages, grouping threats 5.1/5.4 together as \"Harvesting,\" 5.2/5.3 as \"Logging,\" 2.1/2.2 as \"Cropping,\" and 2.3/2.4 as \"Livestock/aquaculture.\" Only threatened species with coded threat information available (145/155) were used for this plot. Only the seven most common threats for each group are shown. No panel is shown for the single threatened amphibian species, the Chinese giant salamander. It was threatened by harvesting, system modications, pollution, logging, energy, and cropping. Similarly, no panel is shown for the single threatened bird species, the Somali Ostrich, which was threatened by harvesting, livestock, and cropping for traditional medicine or trophies (Supporting Information Table S6). Persecution is a major cause of mortality for many of the large carnivores in terrestrial systems (Ripple et al., 2014). Due to their slow life history traits, involving delayed reproduction and few ospring, megafauna are extremely vul- nerable to shing, trapping, and hunting pressures (Johnson, 2002). In addition to intentional harvesting, much of this mor- tality is due to bycatch in snares and traps in terrestrial systems or gillnets, trawls, and longlines in aquatic systems. Many of the megafauna species are simultaneously aected by various types of habitat degradation (Figure 2). When taken together, these threats to habitats can have major negative cumulative eects on vertebrate species (Betts et al., 2017; Shackelford, Standish, Ripple, & Starzomski, 2018). Consistent with our results, overexploitation and habitat loss (mainly from agri- culture) are considered major twin threats to biodiversity in general (Maxwell et al., 2016). The world's terrestrial mammalian megafauna are more prone to elevated extinction risk than all terrestrial mam- mal species considered as a group (59% vs. 21% threatened,Supporting Information Table S4). Megafaunal mammals in marine systems are faring relatively better, with only nine of 33 species (27%) currently assessed as threatened, although 28 more species are data decient (Supporting Information Tables S2-S4). Indeed, many of the largest marine mammals are in the process of recovering after the global cessation of industrial whaling in 1986 (Magera, Flemming, Kaschner, Christensen, & Lotze, 2013). This bold action required global cooperation and enforcement and has been successful in halt- ing and reversing extinction threats for most of the great whales, with some notable exceptions such as the North Atlantic right whale ( Eubalaena glacialis ) (Taylor & Walker, 2017). Eorts to rebuild depleted sh populations worldwide have been more limited, but with some regional successes (Neubauer, Jensen, Hutchings, & Baum, 2013; Worm et al., 2009). The situation appears particularly dire for cartilaginous sh; sharks, skates, and rays include the highest proportion (9%) of species 100 kg of any of the classes examined here, and are more threatened, on average than any other marine group (Figure 1; Dulvy et al., 2014; Worm et al., 2013).

Numbers of threatened megafauna species are shown in the panel titles. Reasons for harvesting were determined using species Red List fact sheet pages as well as Arkive.org species accounts (Arkive, 2018). Only the six most common reasons for each group are shown (other reasons are grouped under \"Other\"). No panel is shown for the single threatened amphibian species, the Chinese giant salamander. It is hunted for meat and live trade. Similarly, no panel is shown for the single threatened bird species, the Somali Ostrich, which is hunted for meat, eggs, skins, and feathers large ray-nned sh are highly threatened in both marine and freshwater systems (Supporting Information Table S2). The single threatened megafauna bird species, the Somali ostrich ( Struthio molybdophanes ) (Figure 4), is killed for its meat, feathers, and leather. Egg collection is also a major concern. Other threats include logging, livestock, and crop- ping. Of the amphibians, only one species 40 kg exists, the Chinese Giant Salamander ( Andrias davidianus ) (Figure 4), and it is critically endangered. This salamander, which can grow to 1.8 m long, is considered a living fossil and is one of only three living species in a family that dates back 170 million years (Chen et al., 2018). However, it is considered a delicacy in Asia, and consequently is threatened by hunt- ing. Other threats include development, pollution, and crop- ping. Since the 1980s, 14 nature reserves have been created to conserve the Chinese Giant Salamander (Arkive, 2018), but population numbers are still declining (Supporting Informa- tion Table S1), and its imminent extinction in the wild has now been predicted (Turvey et al., 2018). We also identied 33 (assessed non-DD/EW/EX) reptile megafauna species, of which 27 (82%) are threatened (Figure 1). Even with thisextraordinary level of threat, reptiles have often been less prominent in global conservation eorts. This is at least par- tially due to the paucity of available information on their extinction risk and threats reflecting a lack of attention (B\u00f6hm et al., 2013). All of the 20 threatened reptile species with coded threat data are at risk due to harvesting (Figure 2). The top reasons for harvesting reptiles include egg collection and meat acquisition (Figure 3). An additional seven reptile megafauna are listed as threatened but lack coded threat data, a situation that should be remedied by the IUCN as soon as possible (Tingley, Meiri, & Chapple, 2016). The ecosystem impacts that the loss of megafauna may entail are likely out of proportion to their dwindling numbers and small collective biomass. The ongoing loss of megafauna alters the structure and function of their ecosystems, often in ways that are surprising and disruptive (Estes et al., 2011, 2016). Known examples include impacts on seed dispersal, nutrient cycling, re, and small animals when large terrestrial herbivores decline (Ripple et al., 2015), or the destabiliza- tion of sh communities that experienced a loss of sharks and other large predators (Britten et al., 2014). Interestingly, theseRIPPLE ET AL . 7o f1 0 FIGURE 4 Largest megafauna species in each major vertebrate group.

Whale shark (EN) flesh is highly valued in some Asian markets and the demand for shark-n soup threatens this species. Leatherbacks (VU) are threatened by sheries bycatch as well as human consumption of eggs and meat. Belugas (CR) are threatened by overshing for meat and caviar, which will soon cause global extinction of the remaining natural wild populations. Elephant (VU) poaching is critically elevated due to an increased demand for ivory. The Chinese Giant Salamander (CR) is threatened by hunting, as its flesh is considered a delicacy in Asia. Somali ostriches (VU) are shot for food, leather, and feathers. The largest marine mammal, the blue whale ( Balaenoptera musculus ), is not shown8o f1 0 RIPPLE ET AL . eects are transmitted both through consumptive and noncon- sumptive mechanisms, whereas the presence of megafauna predators fundamentally alters the behavior and distribution of prey species even in the absence of direct predation events (Heithaus, Frid, Wirsing, & Worm, 2008). Megafauna are also of critical importance for conservation because the largest species are often flagship species, umbrella species, key- stone, and engineer species or highly charismatic species (Courchamp et al., 2018; Ripple et al., 2015). Preserving the remaining megafauna is likely going to be a dicult and complex task, as megafauna are represented by a diversity of taxa using assorted (terrestrial, freshwater, marine) habitats, and scattered across jurisdictions around the world. Based on the research presented here, we argue that any successful conservation strategy must consider min- imizing the direct killing of megafauna as a priority solu- tion, because it appears to be a major driver of extinc- tion threat. Given the low abundances of most threatened megafauna (abundance is one of the IUCN's criteria for list- ing species as threatened), the impacts of such a strategy on food supply would likely be minimal, but economic values, cultural practices, and social norms might complicate the pic- ture. We believe creating an informed public is an important rst step as educational campaigns can reduce demand for highly valuable megafauna species. For example, shark n commerce has declined following eective media campaigns involving Chinese celebrities (Dell'Apa, Smith, & Kaneshiro- Pineiro, 2014). For charismatic megafauna species threat- ened by human harvesting, additional well-organized pleas by celebrities might be very eective, but this is not enough on its own. Where possible, it is also essential to use legal means to lower the harvesting of the concerned species, as these can be more eective than campaigns based on ethical and moral grounds. Legal tools limiting collection and trade would help raise awareness and implicate major economic actors respon- sible for the overexploitation of many of these species. Ensur- ing that scientically established harvesting quotas or bans are established and respected is a key step toward maintaining robust megafauna populations. In order to achieve eective megafauna conservation, a large group of nations needs to take coordinated action soon. Wealthier countries must stop exacerbating the problem by inflating demand and prices for meat, medicinal, and orna- mental products from megafauna. For example, governments could sponsor public awareness campaigns or fund organi- zations that provide information about the plights of specic megafauna species, ecosystem services of megafauna, as well as health concerns and the lack of proven benets for some types of wildlife-based medicinal products (Still, 2003; Weiss & Tschirhart, 1994). The success of the International Whaling Commission sug- gests that a multinational initiative for saving the full diversity of vertebrate megafauna has merit. New international agree-ments should include conventions to share the nancial bur- den of responsibility among nations, especially the developed ones. This might help to facilitate accomplishments under existing conventions that are already trying to preserve biodi- versity such as CITES, the Convention on Biological Diver- sity, and for marine areas, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. At the local scale, it is important that nations that harbor megafauna within their jurisdictions, limit through harvesting laws and informational campaigns, the exploitation of megafauna while at the same time, protect critical habitat. In conclusion, our heightened abilities as hunters must be matched by a sober ability to consider, critique, and adjust our behaviors to avoid consuming the last of the Earth's megafauna (Darimont et al., 2015; Worm, 2015). As direct mortality is a dominant threat to megafauna and live megafauna entails larger economic benets (e.g., ecotourism and ecosystem services) than dead megafauna, it appears that conservation dollars may be best spent on addressing direct mortality threats head-on, wherever possible.
