Even quite young people are exploring mindfulness meditation and talking about karma and life purpose. I've supported patients on their spiritual/life paths with homeopathy since my very early days in practice, having been blessed with an introduction to a whole range of esoteric remedies in my first days in college. Back then I didn't understand their context as well as I do now, but I did create a set of essences or Harmonics from these amazing remedies in 2003, which we recently tweaked to refine the focus for today's energy and issues. It can sometimes be difficult for a 'classical' homeopath to put the patient's spiritual journey into the context of selecting an appropriate remedy, particularly if someone comes in saying they are working on their base chakra or trying to release karma or having issues around soul families. For me it is also uncomfortable and often inappropriate to be digging and delving into what can seem like irrelevant issues such as desires and aversions in food or bowel habits, which is often part of the standard homeopathic process, when the discussion is of a spiritual nature. With the more esoteric approach to homeopathy and a clairsentience (or knowing) that comes from somewhere deep within, this is a fascinating topic and one which responds so well to homeopathic treatment. Calling it treatment, however, makes it sound medicalised and to me, because I so strongly associate remedies with being energetic/vibrational/esoteric, I just see working on this level as an extension of everyday practice but using different tools or remedies. Very often when I'm helping people with emotional issues such as anxiety or anger, we will get to a point when even the patient realises this is more than skin deep and connections are made and life patterns recognised. This can be an amazing process, bringing deep insight and healing. It's an awakening for some people about what they are doing here, how they behave and where it comes from. And the esoteric remedies are a tool to help people move through an issue, to let go of a hurt or to open up to their life purpose, as appropriate. So what sort of remedies am I talking about? There are of course many more remedies than those which came out of the Prometheus group in the 1990s and with which I love to work. Peter Tumminello's provings of the gem and crystal immersion remedies is powerful and inspiring information to work with through remedies such as Rose Quartz, Diamond, Lapis Lazuli, Amethyst and so on. Melissa Assilem gave us beautiful 'proofings' in Matridonal Remedies; Gifts of the Mother - bringing through new information on amazing remedies like Placenta, Umbilical Cord and Lac Humanum (mother's milk). You don't have to think too hard to imagine what these remedies are going to address! Just to put things in perspective though, remedies like Sulphur, one of our oldest and most common remedies, can also do wonders for people working on the spiritual or life path. You don't need an amazing sounding remedy to get amazing results! You need a remedy that addresses where you are resonating and what you are working with and that can help you to move forward. Sometimes you need a remedy to integrate the work you have been doing; to help settle in a remedy which came before or may come after and which clears your view of where you are heading. For me homeopathic remedies - whether meditative or traditional - are amazing tools for transformation and at this time in our planetary and personal evolution they are really coming to the fore! Energies are shifting rapidly, things are changing greatly and many people are experiencing chaos, uncertainty and a lack of clarity in their lives. A lot of people feel the universe/source has deserted them because of what is going on around them, but this is partly a lack of understanding of the times we are in and largely a result of being ungrounded. Life can be simple and complex at the same time. So let's have a little dip into a few of the remedies and situations I may work with on this level. At this point I would say that while I love to share my experiences of homeopathy, I find it particularly difficult to put into words the 'energy' of these remedies. All of these remedies I 'feel' as a resonant frequency, I 'see' how they fit with a patient, and I 'know' when the fit is right. This is my pleasure and passion in homeopathy! Oak (Quercus Robur) - Oak brings strength and courage and is helpful in situations where the patient and his ancestors have been worn down and defeated by life. There can be a lack of learning through experience so the same pattern may be repeated over many generations, many lifetimes or even many times in one lifetime! While Oak has an affinity for all of the energy centres, it has a particularly strong affinity for the base centre bringing grounding, awareness and flexibility. These continually repeating patterns can produce a hardness and spiritual rigidity and the remedy can soften this tendency. It also has a strong affinity for the brow centre, helping to clear the fog of life's uncertainty so the patient can see what is needed next. Winchelsea Sea Salt - Made from sea water taken from the English Channel near Dungeness nuclear power station, this remedy is very similar to Natrum Mur (table salt) and Aqua Marina (sea water), but I find it useful in cases where Nat Mur isn't doing what I would expect or doesn't hold. Like Natrum Mur, the remedy has symptoms of dryness, skin problems related to the sun, they both want time alone and both are useful in the treatment of colds, allergies, herpes, etc. From the meditative proving we know that Sea Salt has an affinity for 'kidney energy', the inherited pattern of creative energy that is passed from generation to generation. It is a 'clearing' remedy on all levels, so will detox on the physical as well. It is able to reach back to past traumatic events taken on and carried by the patient or their ancestors. It can help to heal deep hurt held in any energy centre, to assist people to let go of old burdens of grief and resentment, and it is a remedy of new beginnings. Umbilical Cord - My greatest successes with this remedy have been for patients in 'cutting the cord'. Perhaps a child who is too tied to a parent and needs to let go to move out into the world, an adult who feels too connected to their parent and has not got over a grief, or someone who feels tied to a malevolent and needy partner. It can also be useful for someone who feels tied to past life issues, a partner in this life or another, or a job situation. Rainbow (aka Spectrum) - Tasmania is often called the island of rainbows because we have so many rainbows down here, so I have a real affinity with this lovely remedy. While the proving tells us that this is a remedy that encourages the flow of fluid energy and which lightens heaviness in any form, I frequently use it as an integration remedy. It's a useful remedy to help us 'settle in' the action of a previous remedy and get the most out of it. It's a very grounding remedy, which is often needed in this time and place, and will help where there is resistance to change (which can sometimes be self-sabotage) or there are no clear signs for another remedy. In the proving the themes which emerged were disconnection, building bridges, understanding, guidance and support. Aspiration is also a keynote of Rainbow, as it sheds light on the significance of purpose and on the choices people make either to fulfil that purpose or to avoid it. With all the colors of the energy centres encompassed in the remedy, one imagines this remedy would have some benefit for everyone. Clay - This is a great remedy and we only have to think about the properties of clay to imagine the type of situations it is likely to help. While it is a water balance remedy and is helpful for thick claggy mucous and similar, on the emotional level it is a remedy which deals with feelings that are locked away, stuck, unexpressed. It can bring insight for people who are stuck in a situation and can find no way out, stuck in a career, an oppressive relationship or circumstance where there is a stalemate. The sensation would be more like walking through mud or clay than that strong sense of physical attachment we see in Umblical Cord. On the spiritual level these people are also stuck and lack awareness of how they have got to this point, and any or all of the energy centres may be shut down. This remedy can bring movement on any level! Rose Quartz is a remedy many homeopaths know from Peter Tumminello's beautiful proving and book. It was also proved by the Prometheus Group in 1995 in several different forms and I just love this remedy. This is a remedy for the troubled soul particularly with regard to relationships. There is a deep sense that something is wrong with life and a great anxiety. There is often a sense of isolation and abandonment and a feeling of being trapped in their loneliness with no purpose or direction beyond daily routine. A major indication for this remedy can be a history of never having been able to form a stable, long-lasting relationship leading to lack of confidence, despite all appearances. Rose Quartz is a huge remedy for the heart centre, so it has a great affinity for affairs of the heart! Apple Tree Helps to align the spiritual with the physical where the body is not doing what the spirit wants! Heals the aura following trauma or great shock (including vaccination), particularly where the person does not understand what has happened.. A great remedy for children. Enables fearful children to feel safe, where they are blocked off from joy. Helps with troubled sleep. Blockage in the sacral centre with congestion in the physical organs. Moldavite was formed when a meteorite hit the earth producing a dark green, glass-like crystal. The keynote of this remedy is Truth. Helps with spiritual unfoldment, and teaches us to be more powerful and disciplined. It allows us to discern the truth and remove fear. It is one of the purest remedies for spiritual protection. Purple (the color) The highest vibration of all color remedies, purple is a remedy of transformation. Helps break down resistance and allows you to contact your spiritual light. Upturns and uproots old patterns. These are just a few of the many wonderful remedies the universe has gifted us for working on our spiritual and life path. If you have something that is troubling you and don't quite know what to do next, the best step is to organise a consultation so we can work towards resolution. A consultation of this nature, will be no different than a standard homeopathic consultation but the direction may be different or the end result may be different. Again, you may need a dose of Natrum Mur or Sulphur to clear the way and the key is following the trail of the energy to find the key to unlock the door.
