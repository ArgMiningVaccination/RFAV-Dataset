Some people breeze through shot #1 and are hit harder by shot #2, while others may react more to the first (rare, but it happens), while others have very minimal to no effects. We have come up with a protocol that can support the body and ease side effects without the worries of interfering with the immune response and creation of antibodies. We have noticed that some of our patients had zero side effects on both shots, no side effects on the first but mild to moderate (to even bordering on severe symptoms) on the second shot (and occasionally even the first shot), so really, it's all over the map. So far, there has been no real stand out with regard to side effects as far as Moderna vs Pfizer vs Johnson and Johnson, one way or another. I have had patients with severe flu symptoms for 4 to 5 days with persistent fatigue for weeks, I had one patient who got very enlarged tender lymph nodes that took weeks to resolve, and still other patients that have had no issues. Here are the most common side effects of Moderna and Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine shots according to the FDA website: - severe allergic reactions - non-severe allergic reactions such as rash, itching, hives, or swelling of the face - injection site pain - tiredness - headache - muscle pain - chills - joint pain - fever - injection site swelling - injection site redness - nausea - feeling unwell - swollen lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy) - diarrhea - vomiting - arm pain One is thing is clear to me though, you cannot go into these vaccines without being prepared because you do not know how your body is going to handle it. Some of the reactions are induced by the immune imprinting process but some, I suspect, are reactions to one (or more) of the \"excipients\" (or fillers). To learn more about each vaccine including which excipients are in which brand, you can go online to the FDA official website: Pfizer: [https://www.fda.gov/media/144414/download](https://www.fda.gov/media/144414/download) Moderna: [https://www.fda.gov/media/144638/download](https://www.fda.gov/media/144638/download) Johnson and Johnson: to do to mitigate these side effects: To begin with, I tell my patients to go into it treating it like a mini-COVID. Starting one week out and continuing for 2-3 weeks post, strongly support the immune system, take known homeopathics that can help support detox systems and limit inflammation. These are things that are not going to interfere with the purpose of the vaccine. Protocol for Prevention of COVID Vaccine Side Effects: First and foremost: HYDRATE, HYDRATE, HYDRATE!!! Drink your equivalent of body weight (pounds) in ounces. For instance, if you weigh 140 lbs, that's 140 fluid ounces of water a day. Break it up in increments throughout your day. As I always say, \"The solution to pollution is dilution\"!! Basics: eat healthy, avoid sugar, processed flours, fried foods, and alcohol. Get plenty of rest. Go for walks in nature. Since the second shot has the bigger reputation of being the troublemaker, plan around it and keep your schedule very light.
