When the liver becomes con- gested, symptoms such as headaches, dizziness, dry eyes, tendonitis, menstrual pain, digestion issues, dif-ficulty sleeping, low energy, aches and pains, and more can result. One thing to take note of is that the liver regenerates between 1-3 a.m. So, if you are staying up too late at night, you are not allowing the liver time to regener-ate, and if you are waking up between these times, your liver is trying to tell you that it needs some attention. Also, we need to consider the number of environ-mental toxins to which we are exposed to that stress the detoxifi-cation path-ways of the liver and in-crease our likelihood of dis-ease states. These toxins in-clude indus- trial poisons, heavy metals like mercury, lead, and cadmium, elec- tromagnetic pollution, irradiat ion of foods, genetically modified foods, and other dyes and chemicals in our food, water, and air. This is why it is important to eat local, organic foods, to dri nk pure water, and to take some time to do deep breathing. Minimizing cell phone, computer, wi-fi, heavy metal, and chemical exposure will also benefit your health. So, if there are any angry or irritable inhabitants in your house, spring cleaning includes the liver, and there are lots of natural remedies that are helpful. Need to Feel Happier? Clean the Liver... By Amy Jo Howard ND Rhythms are an important part of life. The heart has a rhythm, breathing has a r hythm, the flow of our spinal fluid has a rhythm , and even the progression of our daily activities has a rhythm. When one of these rhythms becomes out of sync, we often feel it in some way, whether phys ically or emotionally, or both. In natural health, Spring brings awareness to the rhythm of Wood energy. Th e element Wood conveys to us an energy that allows adaptability, flexibility, the ability to set and achieve goals, to make quick decisions, and to have stable health. When we do not have a balance of the Wood element in our lives because of stress, poor diet, environmental toxins, negative thoughts and attitudes, lack of exercise , and other stressors, this energy does not flow through us. In turn, the stagnant energy creates reactions of anger, resent-ment, frustration, irritability, quick tempered-ness, and bitterness. These emotional blockages affect the function of the liver. The liver has over 5,000 f unctions in the body, in- cluding regulating bile se cretion for breaking down fats, removing waste products and bacteria from the blood, detoxifying the body from prescription drugs and other substances, storing key vitamins and minerals, regulating blood clotting, converting glucose into glycogen for energy storage, and pro- 61781 Spring Newsletter 2014.indd 2 3/21/2014 11:49:05 AM..Reducing Irritability Beet Salad beets, finely grated or chopped 2 Tbsp. cold-pressed, extra virgin olive oil Juice of \u00bd lemon (organic is best) Crushed garlic to taste (optional) Whisk the olive oil and lemon juice together and mix with the grated beets. Eat 1 - 2 Tbsp. of this salad daily, with other food, much like a condiment! Liver Cleansing Recipes Herbally , consider Liver Cleanse Formula, Gall Bladder Formula, Chinese Mood Elevator, Chinese Liver Balance, Chinese Blood Build, and of course, Dandelion tea. The Essential Oil Blends Juva Cleanse and Juva Flex are fantastic to use aromatically and topically. Homeopathic Remedies to address the liver include Chelidonium, Lycopodium, Nat sulph, and Nux vomica. Working with the meridians, or the energy path- ways, for the liver and gallbladder will aid in restor- ing energy flow to those organs and the body areas that they affect. To trac e the Gallbladder Meridian, place your fingertips outside of your eyes on both sides of your body. Now, begin moving your fingertips up over your head, down your back and legs, and down to the outside of your fourth toes. To trace the Liver meridian, place your fingertips on the outside of the big toes on both sides of your body. Now, move your fingertips up the front of the body, ending when you reach your rib-cage. It is best to trace each meridian pathway three times, tracing on both sides of the body. As you can see, liver health is very important to your optimal health, and Spri ng provides a great opportu- nity for cleansing the liver and bringing the body back into homeostasis. So, if you are looking to feel hap-pier, healthier, and better th an ever, clean your liver! Consider scheduling an appoi ntment for a health con- sultation with one of the natu ropaths at Herbs, Etc. to help personalize your liver cleansing program. Liver Loving Foods Eat an abundance of: broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, kale, cauliflower, artichokes, squash, pumpkin, sweet potatoes, yams, green beans, carrots, beets (beetroot), celery, cucumber, eggplant, garlic, ginger, kohlrabi, mustard greens, okra, onion, parsley & chives.

Now, one courageous doctor is pointing to mounting evidence that leaves no doubt \u2014 GMO foods are even worse than we were told . As this respected doctor points out in a riveting article, no long-term human studies have ever supported GMO safety. Shock- ingly, the World Health Organization only requires a mere 90 days of testing to claim that GMOs are safe. Well, no one dies from smoking cigarettes within 90 days of starting to smoke, either! Yet while lifetime studies still have not been done on humans, sc ientists have done these studies on animals \u2014 and what they found is stunning. Lab mice fed just a 33 percent GMO diet begin developing aggressive cancers (particularly breast cancer), liver failure, and kidney failure. Shockingly, 50 percent of the males and 70 percent of the female animals on the GMO diet succumbed to early death at an age equivalent to 40 to 50 human years. While more people have begun to fight back against GMOs, the big GMO companies spend millions of dollars to defeat laws that would require GMO labeling. Quite simply, these big companies know that GMO crops are cheaper to grow, and there- fore, more profitable. In the meantime, many health experts now warn us to take the only positive action available to protect our health \u2014 avoiding GMOs as much as humanly possible. But cons idering the fact that GMOs are hidden in over 30,000 food products, that is not an easy task. Fortunately, one courageous doctor has stepped up to the plat e.

Previously em-ployed by the City of Big Rapids for over twenty-seven years and working as an operator at the water plant in Big Rapids for a signifi- cant amount of that time, Julie hadn't always realized that she wanted to be a naturopath. She says that her mother had her doing a lot of natural things for a long time and wanted her to go to classes, but she never did. How-ever, after her mom passed away, Julie says she finally went to one of Bessheen's classes, and that \"one class hooked me.\" She says, once she got into it and saw how simple it was (though she clari- fies that although the approach is sim-ple, it's still not an easy path to fol- low), she knew it was what she wanted to do. What's more is that Julie wanted to do something with her training and wanted to bring access to natural health to Big Rapids. She says that the power of flower remedies helped bring this into fruition. Be-fore she opened her store, she was \"being\" Larch and taking it, wearing it, and using it in every possible way. Then, \"I just went with it.\" On Mother's Day weekend, 2014, it will be the 5 th anni- versary of the open-ing of The Herb Shoppe. Julie says her store has a very relaxing atmosphere, and she gets lots of compli- ments that peo-ple \"just like to be here.\" Her store carries a variety of Na- ture's Sunshine herbs, Young Liv-ing essential oils, homeopathics, flower remedies, books, and teas. The store also hosts an infrared sauna, Body Vibes, foot detoxes, massages, and natural health consultations.

In her natural health consultations, Julie sees the need for peo- ple to learn the basics of nutrition, including gaining information about vitamins and minerals. A lot of peo-ple also look for help regarding detoxing, weight and glandular issues, parasites, and parasite cleansing. One of her favorite bodywork therapies to do is BEST (Bio Ener- getic Synchronization Technique). Julie has achieved the Elite Diplomat level in this technique which re-leases emotions that are tied up in muscles. She feels that we can't get well if we don't connect our emotions to our health. The motto that Julie uses in her work is: \"The journey to better health begins with a single step.\" She re-lates that becoming a naturopath has opened her eyes to a whole new way of looking at things. Some of the biggest changes that have impacted her life are, of course, chang- ing her diet and find- ing a new way of eat-ing but also in con- necting with people who need help. Fur-ther, she shares that her life has more peace and serenity; it has brought balance into her life, and she \"can't imagine ever going back to another way of thinking.\" For current and future naturopathic students, she says that you can't do it half way; make it your life focus. The Herb Shoppe is lo- cated at 209 N. Michigan Ave. in Big Rapids, and can be reached by phone at 231-527-1510 or visit the website at wwwherbshoppeonline.com. Julie offers the advice to \"put your heart and soul into it.\" 61781 Spring Newsletter 2014.indd 9 3/21/2014 11:49:07 AMPAGE 10 Dances of Universal Peace Welcome New Instructors NITE is pleased to an- nounce the addition of new members to its in- structing staff.
