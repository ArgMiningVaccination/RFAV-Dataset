Under pressure from everyone fromconsumers to Congress -- and tempted by huge grants -- major hospitals andmedical schools have embraced therapies that they once dismissed as quackery.So accepted, in fact, have alternative medical treatments become that an entirecenter of the National Institutes of Health is now devoted to it. But the questionremains: Do these treatments actually work? FRONTLINE examines thecontroversy over complementary and alternative medical treatments.Visit \"The Alternative Fix\" Web site for more on this story. [URL:http://www.pbs.org/frontline/shows/altmed]A Note to Teachers: For classes in Social Studies, Language Arts and Health; Grade level9th - 12thThese teaching activities are designed to help students explore the history of thegovernment's involvement in medicine, the popularity of alternative medicine intoday's society and the dangers that some alternative medicines may pose.According to a 1991 national survey, one-third of the population acknowledgedusing alternative medicine. Currently, Americans spend $48 billion a year onalternative therapies. The National Center for Complementary and AlternativeMedicine (NCCAM) defines complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) as\"a group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, and productsthat are not presently considered to be part of conventional medicine.\" TheNCCAM Web site goes on to state: \"While some scientific evidence existsregarding some CAM therapies, for most there are key questions that are yet tobe answered through well-designed scientific studies -- questions such aswhether they are safe and whether they work for the diseases or medicalconditions for which they are used.\" The FRONTLINE documentary \"TheAlternative Fix\" examines some of the myriad alternative practices, supplementsand therapies, as well as the motivations of those who pursue them. Thisprogram provides a provocative picture of health care today and provides anavenue for students to:Explore their understanding of current health issuesResearch the development of the Federal Drug AdministrationExamine how literature and media influence public policyLesson Plans2PRE-VIEWING LESSON PLAN:What is Complementary and Alternative Medicine?Students will identify the various kinds of CAM through large groupdiscussion and individual research.VIEWING LESSON PLAN:Student Viewing GuidesTeachers can assign one of two Viewing Guides -- a true and false guide ora short answer guide -- which requires students to take notes on keypractices and individuals depicted in the film.POST-VIEWING LESSON PLANS:Regulating Drugs: The Creation of the FDAStudents will learn about the history and function of the FDA.

It was written by Pat Grimmer, chair of the Social StudiesDepartment at Carbondale Community High School in Carbondale Illinois. EllenGreenblatt of University High School San Francisco was an adviser.3PRE-VIEWING LESSON PLAN:What is Complementary and Alternative Medicine?This lesson will take 50 - 60 minutes.Materials Needed:Students will need Internet access, writing materials and student handouts.Lesson Objectives:In this lesson, students will:Evaluate their understanding of alternative medicinesCompare complementary medicine and alternative medicineExamine five categories of CAM therapiesResearch the popularity of these therapiesShare their research findings with their classmatesProcedure:Part One:1. Write the word \"alternative\" on the board and ask the students to define it.Try to get the response that it means a choice outside of the norm.2. Now add the word \"medicine\" and ask students to brainstorm differentkinds of alternative medicines.3. Finally ask students to guess how many Americans use this form ofmedicine. Tell them that in a survey, 33 percent of Americans reportedusing alternative medicines.Part Two:Divide the students into five groups and assign each group to research one of thefollowing categories of alternative medicine as defined on the NCCAM Web siteat:http://nccam.nih.gov/health/whatiscam/Alternative Medical SystemsMind-body InterventionsBiologically Based TherapiesManipulative and Body-based MethodsEnergy TherapiesPoint out to the students that there are two sections to the student handout. Tell them to research Section I on the handout as a group. Tell them to research Section II on the handout independently. Each of the five groups of students should present a short research reportto their classmates. Invite the students to consider what impact the \"placebo effect\" has onstudies involving alternative medicine. Explain that when people believe atherapy will work, they may sense an improvement. This is a phenomenonknown as the placebo effect and it makes it difficult to verify if the patient is4actually improving. For more information on the placebo effect, pointstudents to \"The Placebo Effect\" on \"The Alternative Fix\" Web site. [URL:http://www.pbs.org/frontline/shows/altmed/snake/placebo.html]Method of AssessmentStudents should turn in their research handout and the notes they take during thegroup presentations.Media Literacy Note: Students need to be aware that Web sites sometimespresent only one view of an issue.

They will look at concerns facing society today andcompare them to the problems of the Progressive Era.This lesson is divided into two steps. (Note: Each step can be completedindependently.)Step One \"Regulating Drugs and Services\" requires 30 - 40 minutes.Step Two \"History of the FDA\" requires 40 - 50 minutes.Materials needed:Students will need Internet access, writing materials and a random selection ofpopular magazines.Lesson Objectives:In this lesson students will:Explore the jurisdiction of the FDAExamine major issues facing the FDA todayTrace the development of the FDAStep One \"Regulating Drugs and Services\"Procedure:The FDA has a complex history. Regulation of food and drugs can be tracedback to colonial times. In 1948, the federal government began inspectingimported drugs. Today, the FDA is a scientific, public health and regulatoryagency responsible for overseeing a large number of consumer products. Todetermine how much the students know about this agency, write the followingquestions on the board or an overhead: What kinds of food and health products does the United States Food andDrug Administration regulate? What products or services are excluded from regulation? What products or services receive major attention from the FDA today?Students can brainstorm answers to these questions by examining copies ofcurrent magazines. Teachers can obtain magazine copies, up to two or threemonths old, from the school library. Have the students skim the magazines andtake notes on articles and advertisements that illustrate:Products or services regulated by the FDAProducts or services not regulated by the FDAProducts or services that receive major attention by the FDAGive the students five-10 minutes to examine magazines and then ask studentswhat answers they found. List the answers on the board.Students should check their answers by selecting \"What FDA Regulates\" and12\"What the FDA Does Not Regulate\" found on the FDA's Web site at:http://www.fda.gov/opacom/hpview.htmlUsing the same Web page, have students select \"Hot Topics\" in the upper rightcorner. Ask the students to name some hot topics and list these on the board. Ask the students to read two articles on any of the topics listed. As a large group, discuss which of these topics may have been ofconcern at the turn of the 20th century when the Pure Food and DrugAct and the Meat Inspection Act were passed?Step Two \"History of the FDA\"Procedure:The article \"History of the FDA,\" on the FDA's Web site, traces the developmentof the modern FDA from 1906 with the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act.The article, written by John P.
