However, as it is a natural sweetener, you might want to know about the safety of jaggery for babies. Offering jaggery to your baby at the right age and in age-appropriate amounts is essential to ensure the baby's safety. Besides, it can help prevent the baby from developing a liking to sweet tastes. Jaggery is often made with concentrated sugarcane juice, date palm sap, or coconut sap. Keep reading as we tell you more about the safety of jaggery for babies, the right age to feed it, its possible health benefits and side effects, and the right way to include jaggery in your baby's diet. Is Jaggery Good For Babies? Jaggery is usually preferred to white sugar [(1)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4237481/). Pediatricians recommend avoiding sugar for babies under 12 months of age [ (2)](https://www.aap.org/en-us/advocacy-and-policy/aap-health-initiatives/HALF-Implementation-Guide/Age-Specific-Content/Pages/Infant-Food-and-Feeding.aspx). Jaggery can be considered an alternative but should be fed in moderation. [(10)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5664771/). When Can Babies Start Having Jaggery? Babies can have jaggery as soon as they start eating solids, which is around the age of [six months](https://www.momjunction.com/articles/babys-6th-month-a-development-guide_00103340/). However, the appropriate age may vary for each baby. Therefore, consult a doctor or pediatric nutritionist to know the right age to introduce jaggery to your baby. Once you have the doctor's approval, you may introduce unprocessed powdered jaggery by adding it to infant foods, such as porridge and purees. However, before introducing jaggery, do ask your doctor about the ideal amount you can use for your baby. Health Benefits Of Jaggery For Infants The nutritional composition of this ancient superfood changes depending on the source - sugarcane, date palm, or coconut. However, there are some general benefits of jaggery, irrespective of the source. - Energy-dense: Jaggery can serve as an energy booster and intensifies the total energy value of traditional foods given to the babies while weaningi [X]Process of gradually transforming a baby's diet from breast milk to solids and other fluids [(3)](https://motherchildnutrition.org/india/complementary-feeding-guidelines.html). [(3)](https://motherchildnutrition.org/india/complementary-feeding-guidelines.html). - Nutrient supply: Jaggery is a mineral-rich food which contains iron, calcium, sodium, and potassium. It also has traces of a few vital vitamins that could be beneficial for your baby [(4)](https://www.longdom.org/open-access/review-on-recent-advances-in-value-addition-of-jaggery-based-products-2157-7110-1000440.pdf). Moderate consumption of jaggery could contribute to the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of the baby. - Iron deficiency: When consumed with a well-balanced diet, jaggery, an iron-rich food, could help supplement iron [(5)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12503656). In the long run, this could help manage iron-deficiency anemiai [X]A health condition caused due to low levels of iron in the body . - Bone health: Calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium are some of the vital minerals that are crucial for maintaining bone health. Jaggery contains all these trace minerals and thus may support bone health. However, there are better sources for these nutrients, and you do not have to use jaggery exclusively for these minerals. - Digestive health: As per traditional practice in India, jaggery is consumed after a meal since it is believed to be a digestive aid. However, there are no scientific studies to back this belief. You may give jaggery water or syrup once in a while to your young infant to help support digestion. - Immunity: In Ayurvedic sciences, jaggery is used to treat various ailments and serves as an immune booster food. However, clinical trials on the same are lacking. Nevertheless, the presence of trace minerals and vitamins in jaggery may help babies combat infections in the long run. - Liver detoxification: The use of jaggery with ginger for liver detoxification is documented in traditional medicine ( [6](https://jaims.in/index.php/jaims/article/view/907)). Alternative medicine believes that jaggery is an unrefined sugar with no additives, but rich in antioxidants, like Vitamin C, and could clean or detox the liver. However, there are no clinical studies to back this theory. - Overall health: Jaggery is often used for the treatment of cold, cough, and flu in traditional medicine. Besides, it is also believed to cure intestinal worms and [prevent constipation](https://www.momjunction.com/articles/newborn-baby-constipation-causes-symptoms-remedies_00802473/). However, clinical studies to validate these uses are limited. Consuming jaggery can have some health benefits. However, its consumption in infants and toddlers must be limited due to some probable side-effects. Remember that jaggery is considered better when compared to white sugar. But it is still a form of sugar and cannot be overconsumed. Possible Side-Effects Of Jaggery In Infants Excess consumption may lead to the following unwanted effects. - Sweet addiction: Avoid feeding excess jaggery since it may cause the baby to become addicted to its sweet taste [(7)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2147592/). - Adverse reactions: Jaggery, in general, is considered as anti-allergic. However, it might cause sensitivity or intolerance in some cases. Thus, if you observe any signs of sensitivity or intolerance like mild rashes on your baby, then discontinue feeding and consult a pediatrician. - Childhood obesity: Traditionally, jaggery, a gluten-free food, is used to [increase the weight](https://www.momjunction.com/articles/baby-not-gaining-weight-reasons-tips_00705237/)of an infant. However, excessive consumption can significantly increase the risk of obesity in children because jaggery is still a form of sugar. According to a study that was conducted by the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/childhood.html), about 12.7% of all children aged between two and five had obesity. - Tooth decay: Jaggery is about 80% simple sugar, which can cause cavities and tooth decay when consumed in excess. Thus, make sure you rinse the baby's mouth with water after feeding jaggery. Ways To Include Jaggery In Your Infant and Toddler's Diet Try to access organic jaggery because standard non-organic jaggery could contain compounds such as sulfur dioxide that may not be good for the baby's health.

It is also known to help dissolve mucus and clear it in the respiratory tract [(12)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772502222002116). However, more clinical studies and trials are needed to validate jaggery's use for respiratory issues, especially in babies. 4. Does jaggery cause kidney stones?

Generally, you can store jaggery in the refrigerator for two months after opening the packet. Also, it is advisable to thaw the refrigerated jaggery before feeding it to the babies [(1)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4237481/).

Moderate amounts of jaggery, when added to food can enhance an infant's nutrition and provide energy, manage iron deficiency, and detoxify the liver. However, excess jaggery may cause sweet addiction, mild rashes, or tooth decay. Always use organic jaggery for infants as they are safer.
