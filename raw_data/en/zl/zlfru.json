We're beaming proud to showcase this fine array of herbal teachers, foraging experts, wild foodies, and writers. Juliet Blankespoor Juliet is a card-carrying plant geek who channels her plant obsessions through writing, photography, and herb gardening, along with a sizable houseplant predilection. She is an ambitious entrepreneur\u2014her earliest enterprise was a get-rich-quick-scheme involving papaya trees (a monumental flop, on all accounts). Juliet's been sharing her passion for plants for over twenty-five years, and has owned just about every type of herbal business you can imagine: an herbal nursery, a medicinal products business, a clinical practice, and now, an herbal school. After graduating from the University of Florida with a degree in botany, Juliet continued her studies by attending programs at the Northeast School of Botanical Medicine, the California School of Herbal Studies, and the Southwest School of Botanical Medicine. Her herbal teachers and lineage include 7Song, James Snow, and the legendary herbalist Michael Moore, now an ancestor. Juliet founded the Chestnut School in 2007 and embarked on her writing career with the [Blog Castanea](https://chestnutherbs.com/herbal-blog-juliet-blankespoor/) in 2011. After many years of teaching intensive, all-outdoor herbal programs, Juliet has finally accepted she's a raging introvert and her teachings are best suited to the virtual sphere, including her line-up of online courses. She has steered the school's focus toward bioregional herbalism from its onset and is now shepherding it towards holistic herbalism and social justice. Leading the school is her biggest inspiration for personal growth, and the enterprise serves as fertile ground for economic activism. Juliet abhors chaos, injustice, and small-mindedness to the point of fist-clenching moments of potty-mouth proportions. On a good day, she exhales, unfurls her palms, and creates beauty through art and compassion. Most importantly, she wears pink on the daily as an amulet to hard-heartedness and as a rose-torch of hope for humanity. Her first book, [The Healing Garden: Cultivating and Handcrafting Herbal Remedies](https://chestnutherbs.com/about/cultivating-medicinal-herbs-a-guidebook-to-growing-healing-plants-in-the-home-garden/), published in April of 2022.

Asia began her journey into healing and plant-based medicine after early years of chronic pain. The experience\u2014 which pushed her into a deep search for healing, both within and without\u2014 led her to the altar of the green world, where she fell irrevocably in love with plants. She began her formal study of herbs with Juliet Blankespoor and the Chestnut School of Herbal Medicine and has continued to study, seek, listen and learn ever since. Asia's work is a unique combination of western and energetic herbalism, stone medicine, earth-centered shamanism and intuitive healing.
