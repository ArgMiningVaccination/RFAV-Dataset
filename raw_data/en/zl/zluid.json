Diagnosing Your Cancer Head and neck cancer affects the mouth, throat, tongue, nose and sinuses and salivary glands. Oral and oropharyngeal, laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers are included in this group of diseases. At Winship, our multidisciplinary team of experts treat a variety of malignant tumors of the head and neck including: - sarcomas such as rhabdomyosarcoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma, acinic cell carcinoma and adenoid cystic carcinoma Our experts also treat benign conditions including congenital tumors, salivary tumors and tumors of the jaw. There are several ways your physician may diagnose your head and neck cancer: - Physical examination. - Imaging via CT, MRI or PET scans with reviews by head and neck cancer radiology experts. - Endoscopy: flexible or rigid endoscopes are used to look for abnormal tissue throughout the head and neck. - Biopsy: a small sample of tissue is examined by a pathologist under a microscope to look for cancerous cells. Learn About Cancer For reliable, in-depth information about cancer symptoms, staging and diagnosis, visit [CancerQuest](http://www.cancerquest.org/patients), an educational and outreach program at Emory University. Your Treatment Options Winship's head and neck specialists provide one or more of the following types of treatment: Surgery: the main purpose of surgery for head and neck cancer patients is to remove the tumor and some of the healthy tissue around it so that there is an adequate margin of resection. Reconstructive surgical options are also discussed before the start of treatment. Chemotherapy: Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill or slow the growth of cancer cells. Chemotherapy may be used in combination with surgery or radiation to maximize the treatment. It can also be used to treat advanced disease by itself or as part of a clinical trial program. Radiation: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill cancer cells. It may also be used in combination with a chemotherapy drug that makes the radiation more effective. Proton therapy: Proton therapy is the next generation of radiation oncology. It uses protons to treat cancerous tumors throughout the body and can be more targeted than conventional forms of radiation treatment. This can lead to fewer side effects. The Emory Proton Therapy Center is the only center of its kind in Georgia to offer patients access to this advanced radiation therapy. [Learn about proton therapy for head and neck cancer.](https://emoryproton.com/cancers-treated/head-and-neck-cancers-and-tumors/) Immunotherapy: At Winship, this type of treatment is available as a standard of care and uses your body's immune system to recognize and to enhance its ability to tackle cancer cells. Targeted therapies: Winship's most promising research in treating head and neck cancer is in personalized medicine and targeted therapies. In targeted therapies, investigators look for new drugs that more selectively target cancer cells with fewer side effects. Supportive Services In addition to delivering the highest quality medical care, we recognize the importance of the psychological and emotional aspects of living with a cancer diagnosis and of dealing with treatment. Our [supportive oncology](../living-with-cancer/supportive-and-palliative-care.html) team addresses these issues in a timely manner with additional support from [counselors](../living-with-cancer/psychiatric-oncology.html), [nurse navigators](../living-with-cancer/nurse-navigators.html), [dietitians](../living-with-cancer/nutrition-services.html) and [social service](../living-with-cancer/social-services.html) professionals.
