American Clay American Clay creates surfaces reminiscent of classic interiors throughout history. Bring the natural warmth and sunshine of Provence into your kitchen ... take a bath surrounded by the tranquil and earthy feel of a Japanese bath or travel to a vibrant Tuscan Villa every time you enter your dining room. Whether you live along the coast, in an urban townhouse, or on a sprawling ranch, the possibilities are endless with American Clay. American Clay plasters are a natural way to finish any interior. Nontoxic and made in the USA, our plasters are a healthy alternative to paint, wallpaper, cement, acrylic, and gypsum plasters. American Clay offers thousands of colors, unlimited textures, and a depth not found in other finishes. Clay plasters help create a healthy environment by \"buffering\" the effects of moisture in a room. This continual exchange of moisture into dry air inhibits the growth of mold, toxins and pollens and reduces energy use. Warm to the touch in winter and cool to the touch in summer, our plasters bring healthier comfort to interior spaces.
