Naturopathic Medicine is a natural approach to health and healing that recognizes the integrity of the whole person. Methods of treatments are chosen to work with the patient's vital force, respecting the intelligence of the natural healing process. The practice of Naturopathic Medicine comes from six underlying principles of healing. Naturopathic physicians try to remove obstacles to healing and recovery and seek to identify and remove the underlying causes of illness rather than to merely eliminate or suppress symptoms. Naturopathic physicians follow three guidelines to avoid harming the patient that include minimizing side effects of substances, suppressing symptoms and respecting the self-healing process. Naturopathic physicians educate their patients and encourage self-responsibility for healthand treat each patient by taking into account individual physical, mental, emotional, genetic, environmental, social, and other factors. Since total health also includes spiritual health, we encourage individuals to pursue their personal spiritual development. Acupuncture can be traced back at least 2,500 years and the general theory of acupuncture is based on the concept that there are patterns of energy flow (Qi) through the body that are essential for health. It is thought that disruptions of this flow may be responsible for disease. Acupuncture can correct imbalances of flow at points close to the skin. Acupuncture involves stimulation of locations on the skin by a variety of techniques. The most studied form of stimulation of acupuncture points involves penetration of the skin by thin, solid, metallic needles, which are manipulated manually or by electrical stimulation. Massage Therapy promotes healing. Whether you are suffering from disease, illness, injury, pain or stress or you are a doctor treating patients, medical massage therapy speeds healing and recovery.
