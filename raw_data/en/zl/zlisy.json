Scant attention has been given to exploring more marginal complementary therapies. The ethnographic detail is designed to make an important contribution to the growth of writing on complementary health. This book shows how the study of the marginal gives way to particular insights about the mainstream of health policy. It relates complementary medicine's resurgence to wider debates on modernity and postmodernity, individuation and individuality, the philosophy of the body and lay beliefs. Citation McClean, S.
