Thus, it has become increasingly important for policymakers and the general public to have an accessible, easy-to-understand portrait that shows how older Americans are faring. Older Americans 2010: Key Indicators of Well- Being (Older Americans 2010) provides a comprehensive picture of our older population's health and well-being. It is the fifth chartbook prepared by the Federal Interagency Forum on Aging-Related Statistics (Forum), which now has 15 participating federal agencies. As with the earlier volumes, readers will find here an accessible compendium of indicators drawn from the most reliable official statistics. The indicators are again categorized into five broad groups: population, economics, health status, health risks and behaviors, and health care. Many of the estimates reported in Older Americans 2010 were collected in 2007 and 2008, the years straddling the large-scale financial downturn that began in December 2007. Thus, although this was an economically challenging time, the data reported in Older Americans 2010 do not in all cases reflect this crisis. The Forum did produce a short report, Data Sources on the Impact of the 2008 Financial Crisis on the Economic Well-being of Older Americans at the end of 2009 that provides information about data sources that may shed light on the effects of the economic downturn on the well-being of older Americans. While federal agencies currently collect and report substantial information on the population age 65 and over, there remain gaps in our knowledge. Two years ago, in Older Americans 2008, the Forum identified six data need areas: caregiving, elder abuse, functioning and disability, mental health, pension measures, and residential care. in Older Americans 2010 , we provide updated information on the status of data availability for those specific areas and add a new call for data on end-of-life issues. We continue to appreciate users' requests for greater detail for many existing indicators of well-being. The Forum encourages extending age reporting categories, oversampling older racial and ethnic populations, collecting data at lower levels of geography, and including the institutionalized population in national surveys. By displaying what we know and do not know, this report challenges federal statistical agencies to do even better. The Older Americans reports reflect the Forum's commitment to advancing our understanding of where older Americans stand today and what they may face tomorrow. I congratulate the Forum agencies for joining together to enhance their work and present the American people with a valuable tool. Last, but not least, none of this work would be possible without the continued cooperation of millions of American citizens who willingly provide the data that are summarized and analyzed by staff in the federal agencies. We invite you to suggest ways in which we can enhance this biennial portrait of older Americans.Please send comments to us at the Forum's website (http://www.agingstats.gov). I hope that our compendium will continue to be useful in your work. Katherine K.

Once again, this report uses data from over a dozen national data sources to construct broad indicators of well-being for the older population and to monitor changes in these indicators over time. By following these data trends, more accessible information will be available to target efforts to improve the lives of older Americans. With the exception of the indicator on nursing home utilization, for which new data are not available at this time, all indicators from the last edition reappear in Older Americans 2010. The Forum hopes that this report will stimulate discussions by policymakers and the public, encourage exchanges between the data and policy communities, and foster improvements in federal data collection on older Americans. By examining a broad range of indicators, researchers, policymakers, service providers, and the federal government can better understand the areas of well-being that are improving for older Americans and the areas of well-being that require more attention and effort. Structure of the Report Older Americans 2010 is designed to present data in a nontechnical, user-friendly format; it complements other more technical and comprehensive reports produced by the individual Forum agencies. The report includes 37 indicators that are grouped into five sections: Population, Economics, Health Status, Health Risks and Behaviors, and Health Care. A list of the indicators included in this report is located in the Table of Contents on page IX.Each indicator includes the following: An introductory paragraph that describes the relevance of the indicator to the well-being of the older population. One or more charts that graphically display analyses of the data. Bulleted highlights of salient findings from the data and other sources. The data used to develop the indicators and their accompanying bullets are presented in table format in Appendix A. Data source descriptions are provided in Appendix B. A glossary is supplied in Appendix C. Selection Criteria for Indicators Older Americans 2010 presents 37 key indicators that measure critical aspects of older people's lives. The Forum chose these indicators because they meet the following criteria: easy to understand by a wide range of audiences. Based on reliable, nationwide data (sponsored, collected, or disseminated by the federal government). Objectively based on substantial research that connects them to the well-being of older Americans. Balanced so that no single area dominates the report. measured periodically (not necessarily annually) so that they can be updated as appropriate and show trends over time. Representative of large segments of the aging population, rather than one particular group.About This Report VConsiderations When Examining the Indicators Older Americans 2010 generally addresses the U.S. population age 65 and over. Mutually exclusive age groups (e.g., age 65-74, 75-84, and 85 and over) are reported whenever possible. data availability and analytical relevance may affect the specific age groups that are included for an indicator. For example, because of small sample sizes in some surveys, statistically reliable data for the population age 85 and over often are not available. Conversely, data from the population younger than age 65 sometimes are included if they are relevant to the interpretation of the indicator. For example, in \"Indicator 11: Participation in the Labor Force,\" a comparison with a younger population enhances the interpretation of the labor force trends among people age 65 and over. To standardize the age distribution of the 65 and over population across years, some estimates have been age adjusted by multiplying age-specific rates by age-specific weights. If an indicator has been age adjusted, it will be stated in the note under the chart(s) as well as under the corresponding table(s) in Appendix A. Because the older population is becoming more diverse, analyses often are presented by sex, race and Hispanic origin, income, and other characteristics. Updated indicators in Older Americans 2010 are not always comparable to indicators in Older Americans 2000, 2004, Update 2006, or Older Americans 2008. The replication of certain indicators with updated data is sometimes difficult because of changes in data sources, definitions, questionnaires, and/or reporting categories. A comparability table is available on the Forum's website at http://www.agingstats.gov to help readers understand the changes that have taken place. The reference population (the base population sampled at the time of data collection) for each indicator is clearly labeled under each chart and table and defined in the glossary. Whenever possible, the indicators include data on the U.S. resident population (i.e., people living in the community and people living in institutions). However, some indicators show data only for the civilian noninstitutionalized population. Because the older population residing in nursing homes (and other long-term care institutional settings) is excluded from samples based on the noninstitutionalized population, caution should be exercised when attempting to generalize the findings from these data sources to the entire population age 65 and over. This is especially true for the older age groups. For example in 2008, only 86 percent of the population age 85 and over was included in the civilian noninstitutionalized population as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau. 9699 95 86Civilian noninstitutionalized population as a percentage of the total resident population by age July 1, 2008 Source: U S Census Bureau Populat on Estimates July 1 2008 Survey Years In the charts, tick marks along the x-axis indicate years for which data are available. The range of years presented in each chart varies because data availability is not uniform across the data sources. To standardize the time frames across the indicators, a timeline has been placed at the bottom of each indicator that reports data for more than one year. Accuracy of the Estimates Most estimates in this report are based on a sample of the population and are, therefore, subject to sampling error. standard tests of statistical significance have been used to determine whether the differences between populations exist at generally accepted levels of confidence or whether they occurred by chance. Unless otherwise noted, only differences that are statistically significant at the 0.05 level are discussed in the text. To indicate the reliability of the estimates, standard errors for About This Report Viselected estimates in the chartbook can be found on the Forum's website at http://www.agingstats. gov. Finally, the data in some indicators may not sum to totals because of rounding. Sources of Data The data used to create the charts are provided in tables in the back of the report (Appendix A). The tables also contain data that are described in the bullets below each chart. The source of the data for each indicator is noted below the chart. Descriptions of the data sources can be found in Appendix B. Additional information about these data sources is available on the Forum's website at http://www.agingstats.gov . Occasionally, data from another publication are included to give a more complete explanation of the indicator. The citations for these sources are included in the \"References\" section (page 66). For those who wish to access the survey data used in this chartbook, contact information is given for each of the data sources in Appendix B. Data Needs Because Older Americans 2010 is a collaborative effort of many federal agencies, a comprehensive array of data was available for inclusion in this report. However, even with all of the data available, there are still areas where scant data exist. Although the indicators that were chosen cover a broad range of components that affect well-being, there are other issues that the Forum would like to address in the future. These issues are identified in the \"Data Needs\" section (page 63). Mission The Forum's mission is to encourage cooperation and collaboration among federal agencies to improve the quality and utility of data on the aging population. To accomplish this mission, the Forum provides agencies with a venue to discuss data issues and concerns that cut across agency boundaries, facilitates the development of new databases, improves mechanisms currently used to disseminate information on aging-related data, invites researchers to report on cutting-edge analyses of data, and encourages international collaboration. The specific goals of the Forum are to improve both the quality and use of data on the aging population by: Widening access to information on the aging population through periodic publications and other means. Promoting communication among data producers, researchers, and public policy- makers. Coordinating the development and use of statistical databases among federal agencies. identifying information gaps and data inconsistencies. investigating questions of data quality. Encouraging cross-national research and data collection on the aging population. Addressing concerns regarding collection, access, and dissemination of data. Financial Support The Forum members provide funds and valuable staff time to support the activities of the Forum.

The indicators assembled in this chartbook show the results of decades of progress. Older Americans are living longer and enjoying greater prosperity than any previous generation. Despite these advances, inequalities between the sexes and among income groups and racial and ethnic groups continue to exist. As the baby boomers continue to age and America's older population grows larger and more diverse, community leaders, policymakers, and researchers will have an even greater need to monitor the health and economic well-being of older Americans. in this report, 37 indicators depict the well-being of older Americans in the areas of demographic characteristics, economic circumstances, overall health status, health risks and behaviors, and cost and use of health care services. Selected highlights from each section of the report follow. Population The demographics of aging continue to change dramatically. The older population is growing rapidly, and the aging of the baby boomers, born between 1946 and 1964 (and who begin turning age 65 in 2011), will accelerate this growth. This larger population of older Americans will be more racially diverse and better educated than previous generations. Another significant trend is the increase in the proportion of men age 85 and over who are veterans. In 2008, there were an estimated 39 million people age 65 and over in the United States, accounting for just over 13 percent of the total population. The older population in 2030 is expected to be twice as large as in 2000, growing from 35 million to 72 million and representing nearly 20 percent of the total U.S. population. (See \"Indicator 1: Number of Older Americans.\") In 1965, 24 percent of the older population had graduated from high school, and only 5 percent had at least a bachelor's degree. By 2008, 77 percent were high school graduates or more, and 21 percent had a bachelor's degree or more. (See \"Indicator 4: Educational Attainment.\")The number of men age 85 and over who are veterans is projected to increase from 400,000 in 2000 to almost 1.2 million by 2010. The proportion of men age 85 and over who are veterans is projected to increase from 33 percent in 2000 to 66 percent in 2010. (See \"Indicator 6: Older Veterans.\") Economics most older people are enjoying greater prosperity than any previous generation. There has been an increase in the proportion of older people in the high-income group and a decrease in the proportion of older people living in poverty, as well as a decrease in the proportion of older people in the low-income group just above the poverty line. Among older Americans, the share of aggregate income coming from earnings has increased since the mid-1980s, partly because more older people, especially women, continue to work past age 55. Finally, on average, net worth has increased almost 80 percent for older Americans over the past 20 years. Yet major inequalities continue to exist with older blacks and people without high school diplomas reporting smaller economic gains and fewer financial resources overall. Between 1974 and 2007, there was a decrease in the proportion of older people with income below poverty from 15 percent to 10 percent and with low income from 35 percent to 26 percent; and an increase in the proportion of people with high income from 18 percent to 31 percent. (See \"Indicator 8: Income.\") In 2007, the median net worth of households headed by white people age 65 and over ($280,000) was six times that of older black households ($46,000). This difference is less than in 2003 when the median net worth of households headed by older white people was eight times higher than that of households headed by older black people. (See \"Indicator 10: Net Worth.\") The large increase in net worth in past years may not continue into the future due to recent declines in housing values. Labor force participation rates have risen among all women age 55 and over during the past four decades. As new cohorts of baby boom women approach older ages they are participating in the labor force at higher rates than previous Highlights XVgenerations. labor force participation rates among men age 55 and over have gradually begun to increase after a steady decline from the early 1960s to the mid-1990s. (See \"Indicator 11: Participation in the Labor Force.\") Health Status Americans are living longer than ever before, yet their life expectancies lag behind those of other developed nations. Older age is often accompanied by increased risk of certain diseases and disorders. large proportions of older Americans report a variety of chronic health conditions such as hypertension and arthritis. Despite these and other conditions, the rate of functional limitations among older people has declined in recent years. Life expectancy at age 65 in the United States is lower than that of many other industrialized nations. In 2005, women age 65 in Japan could expect to live on average 3.7 years longer than women in the United States. Among men, the difference was 1.3 years. (See \"Indicator 14: Life Expectancy.\") The prevalence of certain chronic conditions differs by sex. Women report higher levels of arthritis (55 percent versus 42 percent) than men. Men report higher levels of heart disease (38 percent versus 27 percent) and cancer (24 percent versus 21 percent). (See \"Indicator 16: Chronic Health Conditions.\") Between 1992 and 2007, the age-adjusted proportion of people age 65 and over with a functional limitation declined from 49 percent to 42 percent. (See \"Indicator 20: Functional Limitations.\") Health Risks and Behaviors Social and lifestyle factors can affect the health and well-being of older Americans. These factors include preventive behaviors such as cancer screenings and vaccinations along with diet, physical activity, obesity, and cigarette smoking. Health and well-being are also affected by the quality of the air where people live and by the time they spend socializing and communicating with others. Many of these health risks and behaviors have shown long-term improvements, even though recent estimates indicate no significant changes.There was no significant change in the percentage of people age 65 and over reporting physical activity between 1997 and 2008. (See \"Indicator 24: Physical Activity.\") As with other age groups, the percentage of people age 65 and over who are obese has increased since 1988-1994. In 2007-2008, 32 percent of people age 65 and over were obese, compared with 22 percent in 1988-1994. However, over the past several years, the trend has leveled off, with no statistically significant change in obesity for older men or women between 1999-2000 and 2007-2008. (See \"Indicator 25: Obesity.\") The percentage of people age 65 and over living in counties that experienced poor air quality for any air pollutant decreased from 52 percent in 2000 to 36 percent in 2008. (See \"Indicator 27: Air Quality.\") The proportion of leisure time that older Americans spent socializing and communicating\u2014such as visiting friends or attending or hosting social events\u2014declined with age. For Americans age 55-64, 13 percent of leisure time was spent socializing and communicating compared with 8 percent for those age 75 and over. (See \"Indicator 28: Use of Time.\") Health Care Overall, health care costs have risen dramatically for older Americans. In addition, between 1992 and 2006, the percentage of health care costs going to prescription drugs almost doubled from 8 percent to 16 percent, with prescription drugs accounting for a large percentage of out-of-pocket health care spending. To help ease the burden of prescription drug costs, medicare Part d prescription drug costs, began in January 2006. After adjustment for inflation, health care costs increased significantly among older Americans from $9,224 in 1992 to $15,081 in 2006. (See \"Indicator 30: Health Care Expenditures.\")Highlights XVIFrom 1977 to 2006, the percentage of household income that people age 65 and over allocated to out-of-pocket spending for health care services increased among those in the poor/near poor income category from 12 percent to 28 percent. (See \"Indicator 33: Out-of-Pocket Health Care Expenditures.\") The number of Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in Part d prescription drug plans increased from 18.2 million (51 percent of beneficiaries) in June 2006 to 22.2 million (57 percent of beneficiaries) in December 2009. In December 2009, 61 percent of plan enrollees were in stand-alone plans and 39 percent were in Medicare Advantage plans. In addition, approximately 6.2 million beneficiaries were covered by the Retiree Drug Subsidy (See \"Indicator 31: Prescription Drugs.\")Population 1Indicator 1: Number of Older Americans Indicator 2: Racial and Ethnic Composition Indicator 3: Marital Status Indicator 4: Educational Attainment Indicator 5: Living Arrangements Indicator 6: Older VeteransPopulationPopulation 2Number of Older Americans The growth of the population age 65 and over affects many aspects of our society, challenging policymakers, families, businesses, and health care providers, among others, to meet the needs of aging individuals.

The older population grew from 3 million in 1900 to 39 million in 2008. The oldest-old population (those age 85 and over) grew from just over 100,000 in 1900 to 5.7 million in 2008. The baby boomers (those born between 1946 and 1964) will start turning 65 in 2011, and the number of older people will increase dramatically during the 2010-2030 period. The older population in 2030 is projected to be twice as large as their counterparts in 2000, growing from 35 million to 72 million and representing nearly 20 percent of the total U.S. population.The growth rate of the older population is projected to slow after 2030, when the last baby boomers enter the ranks of the older population. From 2030 onward, the proportion age 65 and over will be relatively stable, at around 20 percent, even though the absolute number of people age 65 and over is projected to continue to grow. The oldest-old population, however, is projected to grow rapidly after 2030, when the baby boomers move into this age group. The U.S. Census Bureau projects that the population age 85 and over could grow from 5.7 million in 2008 to 19 million by 2050. Some researchers predict that death rates at older ages will decline more rapidly than is reflected in the U.S. Census Bureau's projections, which could lead to faster growth of this population. 1-3 2010Population 3INDICATOR 1 number of Older Americans continued Reference population: These data refer to the resident population.

This proportion is partly affected by the state fertility and mortality levels and partly by the number of older and younger people who migrate to and from the state. In 2008, Florida had the highest proportion of people age 65 and over, 17 percent. maine, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia also had high proportions, over 15 percent. The proportion of the population age 65 and over varies even more by county. In 2008, 36 percent of McIntosh County, North Dakota, was age 65 and over, the highest proportion in the country. In several Florida counties, the proportion was over 30 percent. At the other end of the spectrum was Chattahoochee County, Georgia, with only 3 percent of its population age 65 and over.Older women outnumbered older men in the United States, and the proportion that is female increased with age. In 2008, women accounted for 58 percent of the population age 65 and over and for 67 percent of the population 85 and over. The United States is fairly young for a developed country, with 13 percent of its population aged 65 and over in 2008. Japan had the highest percent of 65 and over (22 percent) among countries with at least 100,000 population. The older population made up more than 15 percent of the population in most European countries, 20 percent in Germany and Italy. Data for this indicator' s charts and bullets can be found in Tables 1a, 1b, 1c, 1d, 1e, and 1f on pages 72-76.Population 4Racial and Ethnic Composition As the older population grows larger, it will also grow more diverse, reflecting the demographic changes in the U.S. population as a whole over the last several decades. By 2050, programs and services for older people will require greater flexibility to meet the needs of a more diverse population.

Blacks made up 9 percent, Asians made up 3 percent, and Hispanics (of any race) accounted for 7 percent of the older population. Projections indicate that by 2050 the composition of the older population will be 59 percent non-Hispanic white, 20 percent Hispanic, 12 percent black, and 9 percent Asian.The older population among all racial and ethnic groups will grow; however, the older Hispanic population is projected to grow the fastest, from just under 3 million in 2008 to 17.5 million in 2050, and to be larger than the older black population. The older Asian population is also projected to experience a large increase. in 2008, just over 1 million older Asians lived in the United States; by 2050 this population is projected to be almost 7.5 million. Data for this indicator' s charts and bullets can be found in Table 2 on page 76.Population 5INDICATOR 3 Marital Status Marital status can strongly affect one's emotional and economic well-being. Among other factors, it influences living arrangements and the availability of caregivers for older Americans with an illness or disability.

Over three-quarters of men age 65-74 were married, compared with over one-half (57 percent) of women in the same age group. The proportion married is lower at older ages: 37 percent of women age 75-84 and 15 percent of women age 85 and over were married. For men, the proportion married also is lower at older ages but not as low as for older women. Even among the oldest old, the majority of men were married (55 percent). Widowhood is more common among older women than older men. Women age 65 and over were three times as likely as men of the same age to be widowed, 42 percent compared with 14 percent. In 2008, 76 percent of women age 85 and over were widowed, compared with 38 percent of men.relatively small proportions of older men (8 percent) and women (10 percent) were divorced in 2008. A smaller proportion (4 percent) of the older population had never married. All comparisons presented for this indicator are significant at 0.10 confidence level. Data for this indicator' s charts and bullets can be found in Table 3 on page 77.Population 6INDICATOR 4 Educational Attainment Educational attainment influences socioeconomic status, which in turn plays a role in well-being at older ages. Higher levels of education are usually associated with higher incomes, higher standards of living, and above-average health. Educational attainment of the population age 65 and over, selected years 1965-2008 NOTE: A single question which asks for the highest grade or degree completed is now used to determine educational attainment.

About 22 percent of older non-Hispanic whites had this level of education. The proportions were 12 percent and 9 percent, respectively, for older blacks and Hispanics.Population 8INDICATOR 5 Living Arrangements The living arrangements of America's older population are linked to income, health status, and the availability of caregivers. Older people who live alone are more likely than older people who live with their spouses to be in poverty.

Older black, Asian, and Hispanic women were more likely than non-Hispanic white women to live with relatives other than a spouse. Older non-Hispanic white women and black women were more likely than women of other races to live alone (41 percent and 42 percent, respectively, compared with about 22 percent for older Asian women and 27 percent for older Hispanic women). The percentages of non-Hispanic white and black women living alone are not statistically different. Also, the percentages of older Asian and older Hispanic women living alone are not statistically different. Older black men lived alone about three times as often as older Asian men (30 percent compared with 11 percent). Older black men lived alone more often than older non-Hispanic white men (18 percent). The percentages of older Asian and older Hispanic men living alone (11 percent and 13 percent, respectively) are not statistically different. Older Hispanic men were more likely (15 percent) than non-Hispanic white men (6 percent) to live with relatives other than a spouse.

The official poverty definition is based on annual money income before taxes and does not include capital gains, earned income tax credits, or noncash benefits. To determine who is poor, the U.S. Census Bureau compares family income (or an unrelated individual's income) with a set of poverty thresholds that vary by family size and composition and are updated annually for inflation. People identified as living in poverty are at risk of having inadequate resources for food, housing, health care, and other needs.

SOURCE : U.S. Census Bureau, Current Population Survey, Annual Social and Economic Supplement , 1960-2008. 18 to In 1959, older people had the highest poverty rate (35 percent), followed by children (27 percent) and those in the working ages (17 percent). By 2007, the proportions of the older population and those of working age living in poverty were about 10 percent and 11 percent, respectively, while 18 percent of children lived in poverty. Older women (12 percent) were more likely than older men (7 percent) to live in poverty in 2007. People age 65-74 had a poverty rate of 9 percent, compared with 11 percent of those age 75 and over. Race and ethnicity are related to poverty among older men. In 2007, older non-Hispanic white men were less likely than older black men, older Hispanic men, and older Asian men to live in poverty\u2014about 5 percent compared with 17 percent of older black men, 13 percent of older Hispanic men, and 10 percent of older, Asian men. However, the percentage of older Hispanic men is not significantly different than older black men or older Asian men. Older non-Hispanic white women (9 percent) and older Asian women (12 percent) were less likely than older black women (27 percent) and older Hispanic women (20 percent) to live in poverty. However, older non-Hispanic white women in poverty were not statistically different from Asian women in poverty. All comparisons presented for this indicator are significant at 0.10 confidence level. Data for this indicator' s charts and bullets can be found in Tables 7a and 7b on pages 81-82 . 2010Economics 13Income The percentage of people living below the poverty line does not give a complete picture of the economic situation of older Americans. Examining the income distribution of the population age 65 and over and their median income provides additional insights into their economic well-being. Income distribution of the population age 65 and over, 1974-2007 NOTE: The income categories are derived from the ratio of the family's income (or an unrelated individual's income) to the corresponding poverty threshold. Being in poverty is measured as income less than 100 percent of the poverty threshold. Low income is between 100 percent and 199 percent of the poverty threshold. Middle income is between 200 percent and 399 percent of the poverty threshold. High income is 400 percent or more of the poverty threshold.Reference population: These data refer to the civilian noninstitutionalized population.SOURCE: U.S. Census Bureau, Current Population Surve y, Annual Social and Economic Supplement, 1975-2008. High income Middle income Low 1974, the proportion of older people living in poverty and in the low income group has generally declined so that, by 2007, 10 percent of the older population lived in poverty and 26 percent of the older population were in the low income group. In 2007, people in the middle income group made up the largest share of older people by income category (33 percent). The proportion with a high income has increased over time. The proportion of the older population having a high income rose from 18 percent in 1974 to 31 percent in 2007. All comparisons presented for this indicator are significant at 0.10 confidence level. Data for this indicator' s charts and bullets can be found in Tables 8a and 8b on pages 83-84.The trend in median household income of the older population also has been positive. In 1974, the median household income for householders age 65 and over was $20,838 when expressed in 2007 dollars. By 2007, the median household income had increased to $29,393.Economics 14INDICATOR 9 Sources of Income Most older Americans are retired from full-time work. Social Security was developed as a floor of protection for their incomes, to be supplemented by other pension income, income from assets, and to some extent, continued earnings. Over time, Social Security has taken on a greater importance to many older Americans.

The share of income from pensions increased rapidly in the 1960s and 1970s to a peak in 1992 and has fluctuated since then. The share of income from assets peaked in the mid-1980s and has generally declined since then. The share from earnings has had the opposite pattern\u2014declining until the mid-1980s and generally increasing since then. In 2008, aggregate income for the population aged 65 and over came largely from four sources. Social Security provided 37 percent, earnings provided 30 percent, pensions provided 19 percent, and asset income accounted for 13 percent. About 89 percent of people age 65 and over live in families with income from Social Security. About three-fifths (59 percent) are in families with income from assets, and two-fifths (44 percent) with income from pensions. About two-fifths (38 percent) are in families with earnings. About 1 in 20 (5 percent) are in families receiving cash public assistance. Among married couples and nonmarried people age 65 and over in the lowest fifth of the income distribution, social security accounts for 83 percent of aggregate income, and cash public assistance for another 8 percent. For those whose income is in the highest income category, social security, pensions, and asset income each account for almost a fifth of aggregate income, and earnings accounts for the remaining two-fifths.Economics 15sources of income continued Sources of income for married couples and nonmarried people who are age 65 and over, by income quintile, percent distribution, 2008 Percent 2 11Other Public assistance Earnings Pensions Asset Income Social Security Lowest fifth Second fifth Third fifth Income LevelFourth fifth Highest fifth NOTE: A married couple is age 65 and over if the husband is age 65 and over or the husband is younger than age 55 and the wife is age 65 and over.

The financial situation of 2008 was the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s. This downturn could affect income received in 2008 by the population age 55 and over. People aged 50-64 may have been most affected by the downturn and people age 65 and over may have been least affected by the downturn. 6 Between the peak of October 9, 2007, and through January 2009, the Wilshire 5000 index of broad stock holdings decreased by 47 percent. 7 Retirement accounts of those 50 and over lost 18 percent of their value over the 12 months 8 and by May 2009, retirement accounts lost $2.7 trillion or 31 percent since september 2007.9 The economic downturn also resulted in rising unemployment, decreasing spending, and falling housing prices with threats of foreclosure. 10 There is likely to be a negative impact on the economic well-being of current and future retirees although it is unclear the extent of the negative impact. 7 Data for this indicator' s charts and bullets can be found in Tables 9a, 9b, and 9c on pages 85-86.Economics 16INDICATOR 10 Net Worth Net worth (the value of real estate, stocks, bonds, and other assets minus outstanding debts) is an important indicator of economic security and well-being. Greater net worth allows a family to maintain its standard of living when income falls because of job loss, health problems, or family changes such as divorce or widowhood. Between 1984 and 2007, the median net worth In 2007, the median net worth of households of households headed by white people age headed by married people age 65 and older 65 and over increased by 112 percent, from ($385,000) was more than 2.5 times that of $131,800 to $280,000. The median net worth households headed by unmarried people in the of households headed by black people age 65 same age group ($152,000). and over increased 55 percent from $29,700 to $46,000. In 1984, the median net worth of households headed by white people age 65 and over was four times that of households headed by black people over 65. In 2007, the median net worth of older white households was six times that of older black households. This difference is less than it was in 2003, when the median net worth of white older households was eight times higher than older black households.Economics 17INDICATOR 10 Net Worth continued Overall, between 1984 and 2007, the median Between 1984 and 2007, the median net worth net worth of households headed by people age of households headed by people age 65 and over 65 and older increased by 106 percent (from without a high school diploma increased by 21 $114,900 to $237,000). The increase over percent. Almost all of this increase occurred the last two years, from 2005 to 2007, was 15 between 2005 and 2007; between 1984 and percent (from $206,600 to $237,000). 2005, the median net worth in these households remained approximately the same. By contrast, In 2007, households headed by people age 65 between 1984 and 2007, the median net worth and over with at least some college reported a of older households headed by those with some median household net worth ($434,400) more college or more increased by 73 percent. than five times that of households headed by older people without a high school diploma ($78,000).

Some older Americans work out of economic necessity. Others may be attracted by the social contact, intellectual challenges, or sense of value that work often provides.

The participation rate for men age 62-64 declined from 76 percent in 1963 to a low of 45 percent in 1995, and has gradually increased since then. In 2008, the participation rate for men age 62-64 was 53 percent. Men age 65-69 also have experienced a gradual rise in labor force participation following a period of decline in the late 1960s and 1970s. The labor force participation rate for men age 65-69 declined from a high of 43 percent in 1967 to 24 percent in 1985. Their participation rate leveled off from the mid-1980s to the early 1990s and remained in the 24 to 26 percent range. Beginning in the mid-1990s, the labor force participation rate began to increase and reached 36 percent in 2008. The participation rate for men age 70 and over showed a similar pattern from 1963 to 2008. In 1993, the labor force participation rate for men age 70 and over reached a low of 10 percent after declining from 21 percent in 1963. Since reaching the lows of the mid-1990s, the participation rate for men age 70 and over has trended higher and reached 15 percent in 2008.Economics 19INDICATOR 11 Participation in the Labor Force continued NOTE: Data for 1994 and later years are not strictly comparable with data for 1993 and earlier years due to a redesign of the survey and methodology of the Cu rrent Population Sur vey.

The increase has been largest among women age 55-61, rising from 44 percent in 1963 to 65 percent in 2008, with a majority of the increase occurring after 1985. For women age 62-64, 65-69, and 70 years and over, most of the increase in labor force participation began in the mid-1990s. The labor force participation rate for older women reflects changes in the work experience of successive generations of women. many women now in their 60s and 70s did not work outside the home when they were younger, or they moved in and out of the labor force. As new cohorts of baby boom women approach older ages, they are participating in the labor force at higher rates than previous generations. As a result, in 2008, 65 percent of women age 55-61 were in the labor force, compared with 44 percent of women age 55-61 in 1963. Over the same period, the labor force participation rate for women age 62-64 increased from 29 to 42 percent, while the rate for women age 65-69 increased from 17 percent to 26 percent. The difference between labor force participation rates for men and women has narrowed over time. Among people age 55-61, for example, the gap between men's and women's rates in 2008 was 11 percentage points, compared with 46 percentage points in 1963. Data for this indicator' s charts and bullets can be found in Table 11 on page 88 .Economics 20Total Expenditures Expenditures are another indicator of economic well-being that show how the older population allocates resources to food, housing, health care, and other needs.

Household annual expenditures by expenditure category, by age of reference person, percent distribution, 2008 NOTE: Other expenditures include apparel, personal care, entertainment, reading, education, alcohol, tobacco, cash contributions, and miscellaneous expenditures. Data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey by age group represent average annual expenditures for consumer units by the age of reference person, who is the person listed as the owner or renter of the home. For example, the data on people age 65 and over reflect consumer units with a reference person age 65 or older. The Consumer Expenditure Survey collects and publishes information from consumer units, which are generally defined as a person or group of people who live in the same household and are related by blood, marriage, or other legal arrangement (i.e., a family), or people who live in the same household but who are unrelated and financially independent from one another (e.g., roommates sharing an apartment). A household usually refers to a physical dwelling, and may contain more than one consumer unit.

The share is largest (38 percent) for households with reference person age 75 and older, even though this group is the most likely to own without a mortgage. As a share of total expenditures, health care expenditures increase dramatically with age. For the 75 and older group, the share (14 percent) is twice as high as it is for the 55-64 year old group (7 percent), and is equal to the share the older group allocates to transportation (14 percent). For the 75 and older group, vehicle insurance accounts for nearly one-fourth of transportation expenditures, and for a larger share of total expenditures (3.3 percent) than drugs (2.4 percent) and medical supplies (0.5 percent) combined. Regardless of age group studied, the share of total expenditures allocated to food is about 12 to 13 percent. Food at home accounts for 7 to 8 percent of total expenditures, and food away from home accounts for 4 to 5 percent of expenditures.

This is slightly higher than the occurrence of such problems among all U.S. households which was 39 percent in 2007. The prevalence of housing cost burden, or expenditures on housing and utilities that exceeds 30 percent of household income, has increased for all U.S. households but is slightly more prevalent among households with people age 65 and over in 2007.

It represents the average number of years of life remaining to a person at a given age if death rates were to remain constant. In the United States, improvements in health have resulted in increased life expectancy and contributed to the growth of the older population over the past century. Life expectancy at ages 65 and 85, by sex, selected years 1900-2006 NOTE: The life expectancies (LEs) for decennial years 1910 to 1990 are based on decennial census data and deaths for a 3-year period around the census year. The LEs for decennial year 1900 are based on deaths from 1900 to 1902. LEs for years prior to 1930 are based on the death registration area only. The death registration area increased from 10 states and the District of Columbia in 1900 to the coterminous United States in 1933. LEs for 2000-2006 are based on a newly revised methodology that uses vital statistics death rates for ages under 66 and modeled probabilities of death for ages 66 to 100 based on blended vital statistics and Medicare probabilities of dying and may differ from figures previously published.

Life expectancies at both age 65 and age 85 have increased. Under current mortality conditions, people who survive to age 65 can expect to live an average of 18.5 more years, about 4 years longer than people age 65 in 1960. The life expectancy of people who survive to age 85 today is 6.8 years for women and 5.7 years for men. Life expectancy varies by race, but the difference decreases with age. In 2006, life expectancy at birth was 5 years higher for white people than for black people. At age 65, white people can expect to live an average of 1.5 years longer than black people. Among those who survive to age 85, however, the life expectancy among black people is slightly higher (6.7 years) than white people (6.3 years).Life expectancy at age 65 in the United States is lower than that of many other industrialized nations.

Between 1981 and 2006, age-adjusted death rates for all causes of death among people age 65 and over declined by 21 percent. Death rates for heart disease and stroke declined by about 50 percent. Age-adjusted death rates for diabetes increased by 29 percent since 1981, and death rates for chronic lower respiratory diseases increased by 50 percent.Heart disease and cancer are the top two leading causes of death among all people age 65 and over, irrespective of sex, race, or Hispanic origin. Other causes of death vary among older people by sex and race and Hispanic origin. For example, men have higher suicide rates than do women at all ages, with the largest difference occurring at age 85 and over (43 deaths per 100,000 population for men compared with 3 per 100,000 for women). Non-Hispanic white men age 85 and over have the highest rate of suicide overall at 48 deaths per 100,000. 13 Data for this indicator' s chart and bullets can be found in Tables 15a, 15b, and 15c on pages 95-99.Health Status 27INDICATOR 16 Chronic Health Conditions Chronic diseases are long-term illnesses that are rarely cured. Chronic diseases such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, and diabetes are among the most common and costly health conditions. Chronic health conditions negatively affect quality of life, contributing to declines in functioning and the inability to remain in the community. 14 Many chronic conditions can be prevented or modified with behavioral interventions. Six of the seven leading causes of death among older Americans are chronic diseases.

Women report higher levels of arthritis and hypertension than men. Men report higher levels of heart disease and cancer.There are differences by race and ethnicity in the prevalence of certain chronic conditions. In 2007-2008, among people age 65 and over, non-Hispanic blacks report higher levels of hypertension and diabetes than non-Hispanic whites (71 percent compared with 54 percent for hypertension and 30 percent compared with 16 percent for diabetes). Hispanics also report higher levels of diabetes than non-Hispanic whites (27 percent compared with 16 percent), but lower levels of arthritis (42 percent compared with 51 percent).

The percentage with trouble hearing was higher for people age 85 and over (60 percent) than for people age 65-74 (28 percent). Eleven percent of all older women and 18 percent of all older men reported having ever worn a hearing aid. Vision trouble affects 18 percent of the older population, 15 percent of men and 19 percent of women. Among people age 85 and over, 28 percent reported trouble seeing.The prevalence of edentulism, having no natural teeth, was higher for people age 85 and over (34 percent) than for people age 65-74 (20 percent). Socioeconomic differences are large. Forty-two percent of older people with family income below the poverty line reported no natural teeth compared with 23 percent of people above the poverty threshold.

Seventy-eight percent of those age 65-74 report good or better health. At age 85 and over, 66 percent of people report good or better ratings. This pattern is also evident within race and ethnic groups.Regardless of age, older non-Hispanic white men and women are more likely to report good health than their non-Hispanic black and Hispanic counterparts. non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics are similar to one another in their positive health evaluations.

Fourteen percent had difficulty performing one or more IADLs but had no ADL limitations. Approximately 25 percent had difficulty with at least one ADL and 4 percent were in a facility. The age-adjusted proportion of people age 65 and over with a functional limitation declined from 49 percent in 1992 to 42 percent in 2007. There was a steady decrease in the percent with limitations from 1992 until 1997. From 1997 to 2007 the overall levels have not significantly changed although a smaller proportion of this population is in a facility compared with earlier years. Women have higher levels of functional limitations than men. In 2007, 47 percent of female medicare enrollees age 65 and over had difficulty with ADLs or IADLs, or were in a facility, compared with 35 percent of male medicare enrollees.

Older women without a high school diploma were less likely to have had a mammogram than older women with a high school diploma. In 2008, 49 percent of women age 65 and over without a high school diploma reported having had a mammogram in the preceding 2 years, compared with 66 percent of women who had a high school diploma and 76 percent of women who had at least some college education. Data for this indicator' s charts and bullets can be found in Table 22 on page 107 .Health Risks and Behaviors 38Diet Quality Nutrition plays a significant role in the health of older Americans. A healthful diet can reduce cardiometabolic risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. The increase in the size of the older population is paralleled by an increase in the prevalence of chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease. 20 Since diet is a modifiable lifestyle factor, dietary improvement can lead to reduced disease risk and improved health in older adults. The Healthy Eating Index-2005 (HEI-2005)21,22 measures how well diets conform to the recommendations of the 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans23 and myPyramid,24 USDA's food guidance system (http://www.MyPyramid.gov). Average dietary component scores as a percent of federal diet quality standards,a population age 65 and olde r, by age group, 2003-2004 aFederal diet quality standard is the Healthy Eating Index-2005; bDark green and orange vegetables; cSolid fats, alcoholic beverages, and added sugars. NOTE: The Healthy Eating Index-2005 (HEI-2005) comprises 12 components. Scores are averages across all adults and reflect long-term dietary intakes. The scores are expressed here as percentages of recommended dietary intake levels. A score corresponding to 100 percent indicates that the recommendation was met or exceeded, on average. A score below 100 percent indicates that average intake does not meet recommendations. Nine components of the HEI-2005 address nutrient adequacy. The remaining three components assess saturated fat, sodium, and calories from solid fats, alcoholic beverages, and added sugars, all of which should be consumed in moderation. For the adequacy components, higher scores reflect higher intakes; for the moderation components, higher scores reflect lower intakes because lower intakes are more desirable. For all components, a higher percentage indicates a higher-quality diet.Reference population: These data refer to the resident noninstitutionalized population.

To meet federal guidelines, older Americans would need to reduce their intake of foods containing solid fats and added sugars, limit alcoholic beverages, and reduce their sodium (salt) intake. Healthier eating patterns would also include more vegetables, whole grains, oils, and nonfat/lowfat milk products. Data for this indicator' s charts and bullets can be found in Table 23 on page 108.In 2003-2004, the average diet of older Americans (age 65 and older) met or exceeded the federal diet quality standards for three components: whole fruit, total grains, and meat and beans; however, nine dietary components fell short. On average, the diets of Americans 75 years and older were superior in quality to the diets of their younger counterparts, ages 65-74, for total fruit, dark green and orange vegetables and legumes, whole grains, milk, and oils; however, for total vegetables, 65-74-year-olds fared better than those 75 and older. The diet quality standards were met or exceeded by both age groups for whole fruit, total grains, and meat and beans.Health Risks and Behaviors 39INDICATOR 24 Physical Activity Physical activity is beneficial for the health of people of all ages, including the 65 and over population. It can reduce the risk of certain chronic diseases, may relieve symptoms of depression, helps to maintain independent living, and enhance overall quality of life. 25,26 Research has shown that even among frail and very old adults, mobility and functioning can be improved through physical activity .27 Percentage of population age 45 and over who reported engaging in regular leisure time physical activity, by age group, 1997-2008 85 and over75-8465-7445-64 \"Regular leisure time physical activity\" is defined as \"engaging in light-moderate leisure time physical activity for greater than or equal to 30 minutes at a frequency greater than or equal to five times per week, or engaging in vigorous leisure time physical activity for greater than or equal to 20 minutes at a frequency greater than or equal to three times per week.\" Reference population: These data refer to the civilian noninstitutionalized population.SOURCE: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics, National Health Interview Surve y.0102030405060708090100 In 2007-2008, 22 percent of people age 65 and over reported engaging in regular leisure time physical activity. The percentage of older people engaging in regular physical activity was lower at older ages, ranging from 25 percent among people age 65-74 to 11 percent among people age 85 and over. Although there was no significant change in the percentage reporting physical activity between 1997 and 2008 among all people 65 and over, there were small increases among people 75-84. Men age 65 and over are more likely than women in the same age group to report engaging in regular leisure time physical activity (27 percent and 18 percent, respectively, in 2007-2008). Older non-Hispanic white people report higher levels of physical activity than non-Hispanic black people (23 percent compared with 13 percent for non-Hispanic blacks in 2007-2008). Other forms of physical activity also contribute to overall health and fitness. Strength training is recommended as part of a comprehensive physical activity program among older adults and may help to improve balance and decrease risk of falls. 28 Fourteen percent of older people reported engaging in strengthening exercises in 2007-2008.

Most of the decrease during this period is the result of the declining prevalence of cigarette smoking among men (from 29 percent in 1965 to 11 percent in 2008). For the same period, the percentage of women who smoke cigarettes has remained relatively constant, increasing slightly from 10 percent in 1965 before declining to 8 percent in 2008. Among older men, blacks have a higher rate of smoking than do whites (18 percent and 10 percent, respectively). The percentage of older women who smoke is similar among whites and African Americans.A large percentage of both men and women age 65 and over are former smokers. in 2008, 55 percent of older men previously smoked cigarettes, while 31 percent of women age 65 and over were former smokers.

Air pollution can aggravate heart and lung disease, leading to increased medication use, more visits to health care providers, admissions to emergency rooms and hospitals, and even death. An important indicator for environmental health is the percentage of older adults living in areas that have measured air pollutant concentrations above the level of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) national standards. Ozone and particulate matter (PM) (especially smaller, fine particle pollution called PM 2.5) have the greatest potential to affect the health of older adults. Fine particle pollution has been linked to premature death, cardiac arrhythmias and heart attacks, asthma attacks, and the development of chronic bronchitis. Ozone, even at low levels, can exacerbate respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma. 33-37 Any standard 8hr Ozone Particulate Matter (PM 2.5) 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000Percentage of people age 65 and over living in counties with \"poor air qualit y,\" 2000-2008 0102030405060708090100Percent In 2008, 36 percent of people age 65 and over lived in counties with poor air quality for ozone compared with 52 percent in 2000. A comparison of 2000 and 2008 shows a reduction in PM 2.5. In 2000, 41 percent of people age 65 and over lived in a county where PM 2.5 concentrations were at times above the EPA standards compared with 11 percent of people age 65 and over in 2008.The percentage of people age 65 and over living in counties that experienced poor air quality for any air pollutant decreased from 62 percent in 2000 to 38 percent in 2008.Health Risks and Behaviors 43INDICATOR 27 Air Quality continued Air quality varies across the United States; thus, where people live can affect their health risk. Each state monitors air quality and reports findings to the EPA. In turn, the EPA determines whether pollutant measurements meet the standards that have been set to protect human health. Counties with \"poor air quality\" for any standard in 2008 NOTE: The term \"poor air quality\" is defined as air quality concentrations above the level of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). The term \"any standard\" refers to any NAAQS for ozone, particulate matte r, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and lead. Reference population: These data refer to the resident population.SOURCE: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, Air Quality System; U.S. Census Bureau, Population Projections, 2000-2008. In 2008, nearly 42 percent of the population lived in a county where measured air pollutants reached concentrations above EPA standards. This percentage was fairly consistent across all age groups, including people age 65 and over.Overall, approximately 127 million people lived in counties where monitored air in 2008 was unhealthy at times because of high levels of at least one of the six principal air pollutants: ozone, particulate matter (PM), nitrogen dio-xide, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and lead. The vast majority of areas that experienced unhealthy air did so because of one or both of two pollutants\u2014ozone and Pm.

Medicare covers a variety of services, including inpatient hospital care, physician services, hospital outpatient care, home health care, skilled nursing facility care, hospice services, and (beginning in January 2006) prescription drugs. Utilization rates for many services change over time because of changes in physician practice patterns, medical technology, Medicare payment amounts, and patient demographics.

Overall, between 1992 and 1999, the hospitalization rate increased from 306 hospital stays per 1,000 Medicare enrollees to 365 per 1,000. The rate then decreased to 336 per 1,000 enrollees in 2007. The average length of a hospital stay decreased from 8.4 days in 1992 to 5.6 days in 2007.skilled nursing facility stays increased significantly from 28 per 1,000 Medicare enrollees in 1992 to 81 per 1,000 in 2007.

There were 11,359 visits and consultations per 1,000 Medicare enrollees in 1992, compared with 13,914 in 2005. The number of home health care visits per 1,000 Medicare enrollees increased from 3,822 in 1992 to 8,376 in 1996. Home health care use increased during this period in part because of an expansion in the coverage criteria for the Medicare home health care benefit. 38 Home health care visits declined after 1997 to 2,295 per 1,000 enrollees in 2001. The decline coincided with changes in Medicare payment policies for home health care resulting from implementation of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. The visit rate increased thereafter to 3,409 per 1,000 enrollees in 2007.Use of skilled nursing facility and home health care increased with age. In 2007, there were 32 skilled nursing facility stays per 1,000 Medicare enrollees age 65-74, compared with 227 per 1,000 enrollees age 85 and over. Home health agencies made 1,713 visits per 1,000 enrollees age 65-74, compared with 7,333 per 1,000 for those age 85 and over.

Average costs rose substantially with age. Average health care costs varied by demographic characteristics. Average costs among non-Hispanic blacks were $18,098 in 2006, compared with $14,144 among Hispanics. Low-income individuals incurred higher health care costs; those with less than $10,000 in income averaged $21,033 in health care costs whereas those with more than $30,000 in income averaged only $12,440.Costs also varied by health status. Individuals with no chronic conditions incurred $5,186 in health care costs on average. Those with five or more conditions incurred $25,132. Average costs among residents of long-term care facilities were $57,022, compared with only $12,383 among community residents. Access to health care is determined by a variety of factors related to the cost, quality, and availability of health care services. The percentage of older Americans who reported they delayed getting care because of cost declined from 9.8 percent in 1992 to about 5 percent in 1997 and remained relatively constant thereafter. The percentage who reported difficulty obtaining care varied between 2 percent and 3 percent.Health Care 51INDICATOR 30 Health Care Expenditures continued Health care costs can be broken down into different types of goods and services. The amount of money older Americans spend on health care and the type of health care that they receive provide an indication of the health status and needs of older Americans in different age and income groups.

Average costs per person were $2,107 in 2004. Average out-of-pocket costs also increased, though not as much as total costs because private and public insurance covered more of the cost over time. Older Americans paid 60 percent of prescription drug costs out of pocket in 1992, compared with 36 percent in 2004. Private insurance covered 38 percent of prescription drug costs in 2004; public programs covered 25 percent.Costs varied significantly among individuals. Approximately 8 percent of older Americans incurred no prescription drug costs in 2004. About 24 percent incurred $2,500 or more in prescription drug costs that year.Health Care 53INDICATOR 31 Prescription drugs continued Under Medicare Part D, beneficiaries may join a standalone prescription drug plan or a Medicare Advantage plan that provides prescription drug coverage in addition to other Medicare-covered services.

Approximately 6.2 million beneficiaries were covered by the retiree drug subsidy. Beneficiaries who were not in Part D plans and not covered by the retiree drug subsidy either had drug coverage through another source (e.g., TRICARE, Federal Employees Health Benefits plan, Department of Veterans' Affairs, current employer) or did not have drug coverage.In December 2009, 6.1 million Part D enrollees were receiving low-income subsidies. many of these beneficiaries had drug coverage through the Medicaid program prior to enrollment in Part d. Chronic conditions are associated with high prescription drug costs. In 2004, older Americans with no chronic conditions incurred average prescription drug costs of $800. Those with five or more chronic conditions incurred $3,862 in prescription drug costs on average.

Medicare covers mostly acute care services and requires beneficiaries to pay part of the cost, leaving about half of health spending to be covered by other sources. Many beneficiaries have supplemental insurance to fill these gaps and pay for services not covered by Medicare. Prior to 2006, many beneficiaries received prescription drug coverage through supplemental insurance. Since January 2006, beneficiaries have had the option of receiving prescription drug coverage under Medicare through stand-alone prescription drug plans or through some Medicare Advantage health plans. * Includes people with private supplement of un known sponsorship.

NOTE: Out-of-pocket health care expenditures exclude personal spending for health insurance premiums. Including expenditures for out-of-pocket premiums in the estimates of out-of-pocket spending would increase the percentage of household income spent on health care in all years. People are classified into the \"poor/near poor\" income category if their household income is below 125 percent of the poverty level; otherwise, people are classified into the \"other\" income category. For people with no out-of-pocket expenditures the ratio of out-of pocket spending to income was set to zero.

From 1977 to 2006 the percentage of household income that people age 65 and over allocated to out-of-pocket spending for health care services increased among those in the poor/near poor income category from 12 percent to 28 percent. Increases were also observed for those in poor or fair health (from 10 percent to 13 percent) as well as for those in excellent, very good, or good health (from 6 percent to 8 percent). In 2006, as in the 6 previous years, over one- half of out-of-pocket health care spending by noninstitutionalized people age 65 and over was used to purchase prescription drugs. The percentage of out-of-pocket spending for prescription drugs increased from 2000 to 2004 (54 percent to 61 percent, respectively) then decreased starting in 2005. in 2006, people age 85 and over spent a lower proportion of out-of-pocket dollars than people age 65-74 on dental services and office-based medical provider visits but a higher proportion on other health care (e.g., home health care).

Medicaid covered 7 percent of health care costs of Medicare enrollees age 65 and over, and other payers (primarily private insurers) covered another 19 percent. Medicare enrollees age 65 and over paid 19 percent of their health care costs out of pocket, not including insurance premiums. In 2006, 47 percent of long-term care facility costs for medicare enrollees age 65 and over were covered by Medicaid; another 45 percent of these costs were paid out of pocket. Twenty-six percent of prescription drug costs for medicare enrollees age 65 and over were covered by Medicare, 45 percent were covered by third- party payers other than Medicare and Medicaid (consisting mostly of private insurers), and 26 percent were paid out of pocket. seventy- seven percent of dental care received by older Americans was paid out of pocket. Sources of payment for health care vary by income. Lower-income individuals rely heavily on Medicaid; those with higher incomes rely more on private insurance. lower-income individuals pay a lower percent of health care costs out of pocket, but have a higher average cost for services than individuals with higher incomes.

This increase may be because VHA fills important gaps in older veterans' health care needs not currently covered or fully covered by Medicare, such as mental health services, long-term care (nursing home care and community-based care), and specialized services for the disabled. In addition, as the largest integrated health care system in the country, VHA provides broader geographic access to these important services. Veterans age 65 and over enrolled in or receiving care from the Veterans Health Administration, 1990-2008 NOTE: Department of Ve terans Affairs (VA) enrollees are veterans who have signed up to receive health care from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). VA patients are veterans who have received care each year through VHA. The methods used to calculate VA patients differ from those used in Older Americans 2004 and Older Americans Update 2006. Veterans who received care but were not enrolled in VA are now included in patient counts. VH A Vital Status files from the Social Security Administration (SSA) are now used to ascertain veteran deaths.

An additional 1.2 million older veterans were enrolled to receive health care from the VHA but did not use its services in 2008. Reforms and initiatives implemented by the V A since 1996 have led to an increased demand for VHA services among veterans despite the short-term decline in the numbers of older veterans (see \"Indicator 6: Older Veterans\"). Some of the changes include: implementing enrollment for VHA health care and opening the system to all veterans (1999) and reopening enrollment to Priority 8 veterans with incomes up to 110 percent of the Geographic Means Test/Veterans Means Test Thresholds (2009).Older veterans continue to turn to VHA for their health care needs, despite their eligibility for other sources of health care. VHA estimates that approximately one-third of its enrollees age 65 and over are enrolled in medicare Part D. Approximately 22 percent of enrollees age 65 and over have some form of private insurance. Another 14 percent are enrolled in TRICARE for Life and 12 percent are eligible for Medicaid. In contrast, about 4 percent of VHA enrollees age 65 and over report having no other public or private coverage. 41 Data for this indicator' s chart and bullets can be found in Table 35 on page 130.Health Care 58Residential Services Some older Americans living in the community have access to various services through their place of residence. Such services may include meal preparation, laundry and cleaning services, and help with medications. Availability of such services through the place of residence may help older Americans maintain their independence and avoid institutionalization.

Respondents were asked about access to these services, but not whether they actually used the services. A residence (or unit) is considered a long-term care facility if it is certified by Medicare or Medicaid; or has three or more beds and is licensed as a nursing home or other long-term care facility and provides at least one personal care service; or provides 24-hour, seven-day-a-week supervision by a non-family, paid caregiver.

The percentage of people residing in community housing with services and in long-term care facilities was higher for the older age groups; among individuals age 85 and over, 7 percent resided in community housing with services, and 15 percent resided in long-term care facilities. Among individuals age 65-74, 98 percent resided in traditional community settings. Among residents of community housing with services, 87 percent reported access to meal preparation services; 84 percent reported access to housekeeping/cleaning services; 72 percent reported access to laundry services; and 51 percent reported access to help with medications. These numbers reflect percentages reporting availability of specific services, but not necessarily the number that actually used these services. Sixty-five percent of residents in community housing with services reported that there were separate charges for at least some services.Health Care 59INDICATOR 36 residential services continued Percentage of Medicare enrollees age 65 and over with functional limitations, by residential setting, 2007 NOTE: Community housing with services applies to respondents who reported they lived in retirement communities or apartments, senior citizen housing, continuing care retirement facilities, assisted living facilities, staged living communities, board and care facilities/homes, and other similar situations, AND who reported they had access to one or more of the following services through their place of residence: meal preparation; cleaning or housekeeping services; laundry services; help with medications.

Among long- term care facility residents, 83 percent had at least one ADL limitation. Thirty-six percent of individuals living in community housing with services had no ADL or instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) limitations. The availability of personal services in residential settings may explain some of the observed decline in nursing home use.Residents of community housing with services tended to have similar incomes to traditional community residents, and higher incomes than long-term care facility residents. Thirty-eight percent of long-term care facility residents had incomes of $10,000 or less in 2007, compared with 13-14 percent of traditional community residents and residents of community housing with services. Over one-half (56 percent) of people living in community housing with services reported they could continue living there if they needed substantial care.

In this report, the Forum updates those six areas, identifying new data sources when available, and provides information on one additional topic area. These topics have been identified by the Forum as priority areas for data collection efforts related to older Americans: caregiving, elder abuse, functioning and disability, mental health and cognitive functioning, pension measures, residential care, and end-of-life issues. Caregiving Informal (unpaid) family caregivers provide the majority of assistance that enables chronically disabled older people to continue to live in the community rather than in specialized care facilities. The annual economic value of informal eldercare exceeds national spending on formal (paid) care. 42 Many of these chronically disabled older adults have considerable needs, with some requiring at least 50 hours per week of personal assistance with functional activities. 43 informal family caregivers of older people with high levels of personal care needs can face considerable strain providing such care. In recent years, it has become clear that data are needed to monitor the amount, sources, and outcomes of informal caregiving. In 2009, a new nationally representative data collection effort, the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS), was funded. NHATS, a representative study of older adults, along with a supplemental survey of informal caregivers, will provide researchers and policy makers with improved national estimates of caregiving and its impact on care recipients and caregivers. There remain data gaps across the spectrum of care providers. recent data are not available for nursing homes or their residents or providers of home care or their clients. Data are also not available about newly emerging providers and it is not possible to combine information across all caregivers or all receivers of care.Residential Care A general shift in state Medicaid long-term care policy and independent growth in private-pay residential care has led to an increasing set of alternatives to home care and traditional skilled nursing facilities. residential care outside of the traditional nursing home is provided in diverse settings (e.g., assisted living facilities, board and care homes, personal care homes, and continuing-care retirement communities). A common characteristic is that these places provide both housing and supportive services. supportive services typically include protective oversight and help with instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) such as transportation, meal preparation, and taking medications, and more basic activities of daily living (ADLs) such as eating, dressing, and bathing. Despite the growing role of residential care, there has been little national data on the number and characteristicsof facilities and the people living in these settings. in Older Americans 2008, the Forum reported that federal agencies were working to design a new survey to obtain these estimates. As of 2010, the National Survey of Residential Care Facilities (NSRCF) is being fielded as the first-ever national survey of residential care providers. residential care facilities include places such as: assisted living residences; board and care homes; and personal care homes that are licensed, registered, listed, certified, or otherwise regulated by a state. The NSRCF is designed to produce estimates of these places and their residents. It will allow for the identification of varied levels of supportive care and assistance by housing arrangement. The NSRCF will fill a set of essential data gaps related to residential care facilities. Beyond residential care facilities, there remains a need for data to address questions about differences in health care costs by type of housing arrangement. For example, data are needed to assess how health care costs of older adults living in congregate housing settings compare to those that live in other settings.Data Needs 64Elder Abuse In 1998, the Institute of Medicine at the National Academies reported a \"paucity of research\" on elder abuse and neglect, with most prior studies lacking empirical evidence. 44 In response to this report, the Committee on National Statistics and the Committee on Law and Justice convened an expert panel to review the risk and prevalence of elder abuse and neglect. The panel published its report in 2003, finding that there are no reliable national estimates of elder abuse, nor are the risk factors clearly understood. 45 The need for a national study of elder abuse and neglect is supported by the growing number of older people, increasing public awareness of the problem, new legal requirements for reporting abuse, and advances in questionnaire design. Following the 2003 report, the National Institute on Aging funded a series of grants to develop survey methodologies for abuse and neglect surveillance. The CDC (with the assistance of the member agencies of the Elder Justice Working Group) has developed preliminary definitions for elder maltreatment as a first step in designing recommended data elements for use in elder maltreatment surveillance. Additionally, a new indicator is being included in the Healthy People 2020 initiative, increasing the number of states that collect and publicly report incidences of elder maltreatment. Functioning and Disability information on trends in functioning and disability is critical for monitoring the health and well-being of the older population. However, the concept of disability encompasses many different dimensions of health and functioning and their multifaceted interactions with the environment. Furthermore, specific definitions of disability are used by some government agencies to determine eligibility for benefits. As a result, disability is often measured in different ways across surveys, and this has led to disparate estimates of the prevalence of disability. To the extent possible, population-based surveys designed to broadly measure disability in the older population should use a common conceptual framework. Longitudinal data that can be used to monitor changes in patterns and in transitions in functional status also are needed.There are several current national and international activities that will result in greater depth and comparability in information on functioning and disability. Federal agencies continue to work together to find ways to compare existing measures of functioning and disability across different surveys and to develop new ways to measure this complicated, multidimensional concept. For example, the disability questions developed by an Interagency Workgroup for the American community survey are being adopted by other federal surveys. Methodological research on these newly developed disability measures is being conducted as part of the National Health Interview Survey. The new National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS) includes measures of disability and functional status that will capture multiple components of disability, including the intersection of environment and physical and cognitive functioning, as well as the relationship between limitations and overall health and quality of life. in response to a request from national Institute on Aging, the National Academies recently convened a panel to investigate additional ways to address these complex issues. Their workshop report describes a number of innovative ways to enhance comparability and improve validity across surveys and in different settings. 46 International developments include work from the Washington Group on Disability Statistics, a UN-sponsored city group, and the Budapest Initiative on Health State, a UNECE-WHO-Eurostat task force, to develop comparable questions sets to measure functioning across a range of domains. The Washington Group also is developing questions to access the impact of environmental factors including assistive devices on participation in society. The questions developed by these groups are undergoing cognitive and operational testing at the U.S. National Center for Health statistics. in addition, a set of nationally representative longitudinal studies of the older population provides tools to monitor the dynamics of disability using comparable or harmonized measures. 47 Mental Health and Cognitive Functioning Research that has helped differentiate mental disorders from \"normal\" aging has been one of the Data Needs 65more important achievements of recent decades in the field of geriatric health. Depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, and alcohol and drug misuse and abuse, if untreated, can be severely impairing, even fatal. despite interest and increased efforts to track all of these disorders among older adults, obtaining national estimates has proven to be difficult. International efforts by the Washington Group on Disability Statistics and the Budapest Initiative on Measuring Health State are underway to develop comparable short sets of survey questions to measure cognitive and psychological functioning along with measures of sensory functioning, mobility, upper body functioning, pain, fatigue, communication, and learning. While there are several studies which report estimates of the prevalence of Alzheimer's, one of the major barriers to reliable national estimates of prevalence is the lack of uniform diagnostic criteria among the national surveys that attempt to measure dementia or Alzheimer's. A meeting convened by the NIA in 2009 to describe the prevalence of Alzheimer's concluded that most of the variation in prevalence estimates is not driven primarily by the reliability of the measures or instruments per se but by systematic differences in the definition of dementia. Research is underway to address the challenges in developing consistent indicators of cognitive and mental health. Although not intended to be a platform for the diagnosis of neurological disorders, the NIH Toolbox on the Assessment of Neurological and Behavioral Functions will allow different epidemiological studies to collect harmonized or comparable measures on many domains of cognitive, emotional, motor, and sensory function. Pension Measures As pension plans shift away from defined-benefit pensions and annuities to defined contribution plans, official statistical sources on income and poverty fail to measure substantial amounts of retirement income formerly provided by defined-benefit pensions. The common practice is to transfer retirement plan accumulations to irAs and to take the money out of IRAs as irregular payments. These payments are not included as money income in the most widely used government surveys. improved measurement of withdrawals from retirement investment accounts (deferred income in IRAs and 401ks) would result in improved measurement of retirement income. End-of-Life Issues The end of life is recognized as a uniquely difficult time for patients and their families. many issues tend to arise, including decisions about medical care; caregiving, both formal and informal; transitions in living arrangements among community, assisted living, and nursing homes; financial impacts; whether to use advance directives and living wills, etc. documented problem areas include poor management of pain and symptoms; lack of communication by providers; decision-making processes regarding treatment; and insufficient attention to patient preferences. 48 The end of life has been the subject of many studies and reports, including an institute of medicine (IOM) report in 2003 titled \"Describing Death in America: What We Need to Know.\" 49 The IOM report documented many gaps in our knowledge on how well the needs of individuals near the end of life are being met. Some questions identified in the IOM report are: Where are people dying and how much of the end of their lives is spent in those settings? Who is providing care for them as they die? Do institutional settings support family presence at the end of life? Are physical and psychological symptoms being identified and treated (including but not limited to pain)? How many persons experience impaired cognitive function before death? How do patients and loved ones perceive their quality of life at various time points prior to death? Are loved ones supported through the grieving process? To this end, there is a need for national data to monitor the experiences of older adults nearing death as well as those closely linked to these individuals. Information on some of these topics will be available with the release of Health, United States, 2010, which will include a special feature on death and dying. 50References 66References Horiuchi S.

Data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey by age group represent average annual expenditures for consumer units by the age of reference person, who is the person listed as the owner or renter of the home. For example, the data on people age 65 and over reflect consumer units with a reference person age 65 or older. The Consumer Expenditure Survey collects and publishes information from consumer units, which are generally defined as a person or group of people who live in the same household and are related by blood, marriage, or other legal arrangement (i.e., a family), or people who live in the same household but who unrelated and financially independent from one another (e.g., roommates sharing an apartment). A household usually refers to a physical are dwelling, and may contain more than one consumer unit.

The American Housing Survey (AHS) universe is limited to the household population and excludes the population living in nursing homes, college dormitories, and other group quarters. The AHS is a representative sample of approximately 60,000 households in the U.S. and because it is a statistical sample, the estimates presented are subject to both sampling and nonsampling errors. Because the AHS is a household survey, its population estimates are likely to differ from estimates based on a population survey. The estimated number of households with a resident age 65 and over reflects changes in Census weights: 1985 and 1989 data are consistent with 1980 Census weights; 1995, 1997, 1999 data with 1990 Census weights; and 2001, 2003, 2005, and 2007 with 2000 Census weights. NoTE: Data are available biennially for odd years. Housing cost burden is defined as expenditures on housing and utilities in excess of 30 percent of reported income. Physical problem categories include plumbing, heating, electricity, hallways, and upkeep. See definition in Appendix A of the American Housing Survey summary volume, American Housing Survey for the United States in 2007, Current Housing Reports, H150/07, U.S. Census bureau, 2008. Crowded housing is defined as housing in which there is more than one person per room in a residence. The subcategories for housing problems do not add to the total number with housing problems because a household may have more than one housing problem.

NoTE: Death rates for 1981-1998 are based on the 9th revision of the International Classification of Disease (ICD-9). Starting in 1999, death rates are based on ICD-10. For the period 1981-1998, causes were coded using ICD-9 codes that are most nearly comparable with the 113 cause list for the ICD-10 and may differ from previously published estimates. Population estimates for July 1, 2000, and July 1, 2001, are postcensal estimates and have been bridged to be consistent with the race categories used in the 1990 Decennial Census. These estimates were produced by the National Center for Health Statistics under a collaborative arrangement with the U.S. Census Bureau. Population estimates for 1990-1999 are intercensal estimates, based on the 1990 Decennial Census and bridged estimates for 2000. These estimates were produced by the Population Estimates Program of the U.S. Census Bureau with support from the National Cancer Institute (NCI). For more information on the bridged race population estimates for 1990-2001, see http //www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/bridged_race.htm. Death rates for 1990-2001 may differ from those published elsewhere because of the use of the bridged intercensal and postcensal population estimates.

NoTE: The Healthy Eating Index-2005 (HEI-2005) comprises 12 components. Scores are averages across all adults and reflect long-term dietary intakes. The scores are expressed here as percentages of recommended dietary intake levels. A score corresponding to 100 percent indicates that the recommendation was met or exceeded, on average. A score below 100 percent indicates that average intake does not meet recommendations. Nine components of the HEI-2005 address nutrient adequacy. The remaining three components assess saturated fat, sodium, and calories from solid fats, alcoholic beverages, and added sugars, all of which should be consumed in moderation. For the adequacy components, higher scores reflect higher intakes; for the moderation components, higher scores reflect lower intakes because lower intakes are more desirable. For all components, a higher percentage indicates a higher-quality diet. Reference population : These data refer to the resident noninstitutionalized population.

Below poverty (99 percent or less) is defined as people living below the poverty threshold. People living above poverty are divided between those with incomes between 100-199 percent of the poverty threshold and those with incomes of 200 percent or more of the poverty threshold. A multiple imputation procedure was performed for the missing family income data (unknown poverty). A detailed description of the multiple imputation procedure is available from http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis htm via the Imputed Income Files link under data year 2006. Classification of health insurance is based on a hierarchy of mutually exclusive categories. Health insurance categories are mutually exclusive. Persons who reported both Medicaid and private coverage are classified as having private coverage. Starting with 1997 data, state-sponsored health plan coverage is included as Medicaid coverage. Starting with 1999 data, coverage by the Children's Health Insurance Program (CH P) is included with Medicaid coverage. In addition to private and Medicaid, the other Insurance category includes military and other government. Persons not covered by private insurance, Medicaid, CHIP, state-sponsored or other government-sponsored health plans (starting in 1997), Medicare, or military plans are considered to have no health insurance coverage. Persons with only Indian Health Service coverage are considered to have no health insurance coverage. Reference population: These data refer to the civilian noninstitutionalized population.

NoTE: out-of-pocket health care expenditures exclude personal spending for health insurance premiums. Including expenditures for out-of-pocket premiums in the estimates of out-of-pocket spending would increase the percentage of household income spent on health care in all years. People are classified into the \"poor/near poor\" income category if their household income is below 125 percent of the poverty level; otherwise, people are classified into the \"low/middle/high\" income category. The poverty level is calculated according to the U.S. Census Bureau guidelines for the corresponding year. The ratio of a person's out-of-pocket expenditures to their household income was calculated based on the person's per capita household income. For people whose ratio of out-of-pocket expenditures to income exceeded 100 percent, the ratio was capped at 100 percent. For people with out-of-pocket expenditures and with zero income (or negative income) the ratio was set at 100 percent. For people with no out-of-pocket expenditures the ratio was set to zero. These methods differ from what was used in Older Americans 2004, which excluded persons with no out-of-pocket expenditures from the calculations (17 percent of the population 65 and older in 1977, and 4.5 percent of the population age 65 and older in 2004).

Each monitor measures the concentration of a particular pollutant in the air. Monitoring data indicate the average pollutant concentration during a specified time interval, usually 1 hour or 24 hours. AQS also contains meteorological data, descriptive information about each monitoring station (including its geographic location and its operator), and data quality assurance or quality control information. The system is administered by EPA, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, Information Transfer and Program Integration Division, located in Research Triangle Park, n.c.

The survey is conducted for the Department of Housing and Urban Development by the U.S. Census Bureau. The AHS encompasses a national survey and 21 metropolitan surveys and is designed to collect data from the same housing units for each survey. The national survey, a representative sample of approximately 60,000 housing units, is conducted biennially in odd-numbered years; the metropolitan surveys, representative samples of 3,500 housing units, are conducted in odd-numbered years on a 6-year cycle. The AHS collects data about the inventory and condition of housing in the United States and the demographics of its inhabitants. The survey provides detailed data on the types of housing in the United States and its characteristics and conditions; financial data on housing costs, utilities, mortgages, equity loans, and market value; demographic data on family composition, income, education, and race; and information on neighborhood quality and recent movers. Race and Hispanic origin: Data from this survey are not shown by race and Hispanic origin in this report.

The ATUS measures how people living in the United States spend their time. Estimates show the kinds of activities people do and the time they spent doing them by sex, age, educational attainment, labor force status, and other characteristics, as well as by weekday and weekend day. ATUS respondents are interviewed one time about how they spent their time on the previous day, where they were, and whom they were with. The survey is a continuous survey, with interviews conducted nearly every day of the year and a sample that builds over time. About 13,000 members of the civilian noninstitutionalized population age 15 and over are interviewed each year. Race and Hispanic origin: Data from this survey are not shown by race and Hispanic origin in this report.

The survey contains both a diary component and an interview component. Data are integrated before publication. The data presented in this chartbook are derived from the integrated data available on the CE website. The published data are weighted to reflect the U.S. population. In the interview portion of the CE, respondents are interviewed once every 3 months for 5 consecutive quarters. respondents report information on consumer unit characteristics and expenditures during each interview. Income data are collected during the second and fifth interviews only. Race and Hispanic origin: Data from this survey are not shown by race and Hispanic origin in this report. For more information, contact: E-mail: CEXINFO@bls.gov Phone: 202-691-6900 Website: http://www.bls.gov/cex Current Population Survey The Current Population Survey (CPS) is a nationally representative sample survey of about 60,000 households conducted monthly for the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) by the U.S. Census Bureau. The CPS core survey is the primary source of information on the labor force characteristics of the civilian noninstitutionalized population age 16 and over, including a comprehensive body of monthly data on the labor force, employment, unemployment, persons not in the labor force, hours of work, earnings, and other demographic and labor force characteristics. In most months, CPS supplements provide additional demographic and social data. The Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC) is the primary source of detailed information on income and poverty in the United States. The ASEC is used to generate the annual Population Profile of the United States, reports on geographical mobility and educational attainment, and is the primary source of detailed information on income and poverty in the United States. The ASEC, historically referred to as the March supplement, now is conducted in February, March, and April with a sample of about 100,000 addresses. The questionnaire asks about income from more than 50 sources and records up to 27 different income amounts, including receipt of many noncash benefits, such as food stamps and housing assistance. Race and Hispanic origin: In 2003, for the first time cPs respondents were asked to identify themselves as belonging to one or more of the six racial groups (white, black, American Indian and Alaska native, Asian, native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander, and Some Other Race); previously they were to choose only one. People who responded to the question on race by indicating only one race are referred to as the race alone or single-race population and individuals who chose more than one of the race categories are referred to as the Two-or-More-Races population. The CPS includes a separate question on Hispanic origin. Starting in 2003, people of Spanish/ Hispanic/Latino origin could identify themselves as Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, or Other Spanish/Hispanic/Latino. People of Hispanic origin may be of any race. The 1994 redesign of the CPS had an impact on labor force participation rates for older men and women. (See \"Indicator 11: Participation in the Labor Force.\") For more information on the effect of the redesign, see \"The CPS After the Redesign: Refocusing the Economic Lens.\" 52 For more information regarding the CPS, its sampling structure, and estimation methodology, see \"Explanatory Notes and Estimates of Error.\" 53 For more information, contact: Bureau of labor statistics department of Census Every 10 years, beginning with the first census in 1790, the United States government conducts a census, or count, of the entire population as mandated by the U.S. Constitution. The 1990 and 2000 censuses were taken April 1 of their respective years. As in several previous censuses, two forms were used: a short form and a long form. The short form was sent to every household, and the long form, containing the 100 percent questions plus the sample questions, was sent to approximately one in every six households. The Census 2000 short-form questionnaire included six questions for each member of the household (name, sex, age, relationship, Hispanic origin, and race) and whether the housing unit was owned or rented. The long form asked more detailed information on subjects such as education, employment, income, ancestry, homeowner costs, units in a structure, number of rooms, plumbing facilities, etc. Race and Hispanic origin: in census 2000, respondents were given the option of selecting one or more race categories to indicate their racial identities. People who responded to the question on race indicating only one of the six race categories (white, black, American Indian and Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander, and Some Other Race) are referred to as the race alone or single-race population. Individuals who chose more than one of the race categories are referred to as the Two-or-More-Races population. The six single-race categories, which made up nearly 98 percent of all respondents, and the Two-or-More-Races category sum to the total population. Because respondents were given the option of selecting one or more race categories to indicate their racial identities, Census 2000 data on race are not directly comparable with data from the 1990 or earlier censuses. As in earlier censuses, census 2000 included a separate question on Hispanic origin. in census 2000, people of Spanish/Hispanic/Latino origin could identify themselves as Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, or Other Spanish/Hispanic/Latino. People of Hispanic origin may be of any race.

In 1992, the study had an initial sample of over 12,600 people from the 1931-1941 birth cohort and their spouses. The HRS was joined in 1993 by a companion study, Asset and Health Dynamics Among the Oldest Old (AHEAD), with a sample of 8,222 respondents (born before 1924 who were age 70 and over) and their spouses. In 1998, these two data collection efforts were combined into a single survey instrument and field period and were expanded through the addition of baseline interviews with two new birth cohorts: Children of the Depression Age (1924-1930) and War Babies (1942-1947). Plans call for adding a new 6-year cohort of Americans entering their 50s every 6 years. In 2004, baseline interviews were conducted with the Early Boomer birth cohort (1948-1953). Telephone follow-ups are conducted every second year, with proxy interviews after death. Beginning in 2006, one-half of this sample has an enhanced face-to-face interview that includes the collection of physical measures and biomarker collection. The Aging, Demographics, and Memory Study (ADAMS) is a supplement to HRS with the specific aim of conducting a population-based study of dementia. The combined studies, which are collectively called HRS, have become a steady state sample that is representative of the entire U.S. population age 50 and over (excluding people who resided in a nursing home or other institutionalized setting at the time of sampling). HRS will follow respondents longitudinally until they die (including following people who move into a nursing home or other institutionalized setting). The HRS is intended to provide data for researchers, policy analysts, and program planners who make major policy decisions that affect retirement, health insurance, saving, and economic well-being. The study is designed to explain the antecedents and consequences of retirement; examine the relationship between health, income, and wealth over time; examine life cycle patterns of wealth accumulation and consumption; monitor work disability; provide a rich source of interdisciplinary data, including linkages with administrative data; Appendix B 139monitor transitions in physical, functional, and cognitive health in advanced old age; relate late- life changes in physical and cognitive health to patterns of spending down assets and income flows; relate changes in health to economic resources and intergenerational transfers; and examine how the mix and distribution of economic, family, and program resources affect key outcomes, including retirement, spending down assets, health declines, and institutionalization.

MEPS, which began in 1996, is the third in a series of national probability surveys conducted by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality on the financing and use of medical care in the United States. MEPS predecessor surveys are the National Medical Care Expenditure Survey (NMCES) conducted in 1977 and the National Medical Expenditure Survey (NMES) conducted in 1987. Each of the three surveys (i.e., NMCES, NMES, and MEPS) used multiple rounds of in-person data collection to elicit expenditures and sources of payments for each health care event experienced by household members during the calendar year. The current MEPS Household Component (HC) sample is drawn from respondents to the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). To yield more complete information on health care spending and payment sources, followback surveys of health providers were conducted for a subsample of events in MEPS (and events in the MEPS predecessor surveys).Since 1977, the structure of billing mechanism for medical services has grown more complex as a result of increasing penetration of managed care and health maintenance organizations and various cost-containment reimbursement mechanisms instituted by medicare, medicaid, and private insurers. As a result, there has been substantial discussion about what constitutes an appropriate measure of health care expenditures. 54 Health care expenditures presented in this report refer to what is actually paid for health care services. More specifically, expenditures are defined as the sum of direct payments for care received, including out-of-pocket payments for care received. This definition of expenditures differs somewhat from what was used in the 1987 NMES, which used charges (rather than payments) as the fundamental expenditure construct. To improve comparability of estimates between the 1987 NMES and the 1996 and 2001 MEPS, the 1987 data presented in this report were adjusted using the method described by Zuvekas and Cohen. 51 Adjustments to the 1977 data were considered unnecessary because virtually all of the discounting for health care services occurred after 1977 (essentially equating charges with payments in 1977). A number of quality-related enhancements were made to the MEPS beginning in 2000, including the fielding of an annual adult self-administered questionnaire (SAQ). This questionnaire contains items on patient satisfaction and accountability measures from the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS\u00ae; previously known as the Consumer Assessment of Health Plans), the SF-12 physical and mental health assessment tool, EQ-5D EuroQol 5 dimensions with visual scale (2000-2003), and several attitude items. Starting in 2004, the K-6 Kessler mental health distress scale and the PH2 two-item depression scale were added to the SAQ. Race and Hispanic origin: Data from this survey are not shown by race and Hispanic origin in this report. For more information, contact: mePs Current Beneficiary Survey The Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) is a continuous, multipurpose survey of a representative sample of the Medicare population designed to help the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) administer, monitor, and evaluate the Medicare program. The MCBS collects information on health care use, cost, and sources of payment; health insurance coverage; household composition; sociodemographic characteristics; health status and physical functioning; income and assets; access to care; satisfaction with care; usual source of care; and how beneficiaries get information about medicare. mcBs data enable cms to determine sources of payment for all medical services used by Medicare beneficiaries, including copayments, deductibles, and noncovered services; develop reliable and current information on the use and cost of services not covered by Medicare (such as long-term care); ascertain all types of health insurance coverage and relate coverage to sources of payment; and monitor the financial effects of changes in the Medicare program. Additionally, the MCBS is the only source of multidimensional person-based information about the characteristics of the Medicare population and their access to and satisfaction with Medicare services and information about the Medicare program. The mcBs sample consists of medicare enrollees in the community and in institutions. The survey is conducted in three rounds per year, with each round being 4 months in length. MCBS has a multistage, strati fied, random sample design and a rotating panel survey design. Each panel is followed for 12 interviews. in-person interviews are conducted using computer-assisted personal interviewing. A sample of approximately 16,000 people are interviewed in each round. However, because of the rotating panel design, only 12,000 people receive all three interviews in a given calendar year. information collected in the survey is combined with information from CMS administrative data files and made available through public-use data files. Race and Hispanic origin: The MCBS defines race as white, black, Asian, Native Hawaiian or Pacific islander, American indian or Alaska native, and other. People are allowed to choose more than one category. There is a separate question on whether the person is of Hispanic or Latino origin. The \"other\" category in Table 30c on page 121 consists of people who answered \"no\" to the Hispanic/Latino question and who answered something other than \"white\" or \"black\" to the race question. People who answer with more than one racial category are assigned to the \"other\" category.

NHIS is the principal source of information on the health of the civilian, noninstitutionalized, household population of the United States. Interviewers collect data on illnesses, injuries, impairments, and chronic conditions; activity limitation caused by chronic conditions; utilization of health services; and other health topics. Information is also obtained on personal, social, economic, and demographic characteristics, including race and ethnicity and health insurance status. The survey is reviewed each year, core questionnaire items are revised every 10-15 years (with major revisions occurring in 1982 and 1997), and special topics are added or deleted annually. in 2006, a new sample design was implemented. This design, which is expected to be in use through 2014, includes all 50 states and the District of Columbia, as the previous design did. Oversampling of the black and Hispanic populations has been retained in 2006 to allow for more precise estimation of health characteristics in these growing minority populations. The new sample design also oversamples the Asian population. In addition, the sample adult selection process has been revised so that when black, Hispanic, or Asian people age 65 and over are Appendix B 141present, they have an increased chance of being selected as the sample adult. The new design reduces the size of NHIS by approximately 13 percent relative to the previous sample design. The interviewed sample for 2008 consisted of 28,709 households, which yielded 74,236 people in 29,421 families. More information on the survey methodology and content of NHIS can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis.htm. Race and Hispanic origin: Starting with data year 1999, race-specific estimates in NHIS are tabulated according to 1997 standards for federal data on race and ethnicity and are not strictly comparable with estimates for earlier years. The single race categories for data from 1999 and later conform to 1997 standards and are for people who reported only one racial group. Prior to data year 1999, data were tabulated according to the 1977 standards and included people who reported one race or, if they reported more than one race, identified one race as best representing their race.

Each survey's sample was selected using a complex, stratified, multistage, probability sampling design. interviewers obtain information on personal and demographic characteristics, including age, household income, and race and ethnicity directly from sample persons (or their proxies). In addition, dietary intake data, biochemical tests, physical measurements, and clinical assessments are collected. The NHANES program includes the following surveys conducted on a periodic basis through 1994: the first, second, and third National Health Examination Surveys (NHES I, 1960-1962; NHES II, 1963-1965; and NHES III, 1966-1970); and the first, second, and third National Health and Nutritional Examination Surveys (NHANES I, 1971-1974; NHANES II, 1976-1980; and NHANES III, 1988-1994). Beginning in 1999, NHANES changed to a continuous data collection format without breaks in survey cycles. The NHANES program now visits 15 U.S. locations per year, surveying and reporting for approximately 5,000 people annually. The procedures employed in continuous nHAnes to select samples, conduct interviews, and perform physical exams have been preserved from previous survey cycles. nHes i, nHAnes i, and nHAnes ii collected information on people 6 months to 74 years of age. nHAnes iii and later surveys include people age 75 and over. With the advent of the continuous survey design (NHANES III), NHANES moved from a 6-year data release to a 2-year data release schedule. Estimates for 1999-2000, and later, are based on a smaller sample size than estimates for earlier time periods and, therefore, are subject to greater sampling error. Race and Hispanic origin: Data from this survey are not shown by race and Hispanic origin in this report.

The division of Vital statistics obtains information on births and deaths from the registration offices of each of the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and Northern Mariana Islands. Geographic coverage for births and deaths has been complete since 1933. Demographic information on the death certificate is provided by the funeral director based on information supplied by an informant. Medical certification of cause of death is provided by a physician, medical Appendix B 142examiner, or coroner. The mortality data file is a fundamental source of cause-of-death information by demographic characteristics and for geographic areas such as states. The mortality file is one of the few sources of comparable health-related data for smaller geographic areas in the United States and over a long time period. mortality data can be used not only to present the characteristics of those dying in the United States but also to determine life expectancy and to compare mortality trends with other countries. Data in this report for the entire United States refer to events occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia; data for geographic areas are by place of residence. Race and Hispanic origin: race and Hispanic origin are reported separately on the death certificate. Therefore, data by race shown in Tables 14b, 15b, and 15c include people of Hispanic or non-Hispanic origin; data for Hispanic origin include people of any race.

It is a representative sample of U.S. individuals (men, women, and children) and the family units in which they reside. Starting with a national sample of 5,000 U.S. households in 1968, the PSID has reinterviewed individuals from those households annually from 1968 to 1997 and biennially thereafter, whether or not they are living in the same dwelling or with the same people. Adults have been followed as they have grown older, and children have been observed as they advance through childhood and into adulthood, forming family units of their own. Information about the original 1968 sample individuals and their current coresidents (spouses, cohabitors, children, and anyone else living with them) is collected each year. In 1997 and 1999, in order to enhance the representativeness of the study, a refresher sample of 511 post 1968 immigrant families was added to the PSID. With low attrition rates and successful recontacts, the sample size grew to approximately 8,330 as of 2007. Psid data can be used for cross-sectional, longitudinal, and intergenerational analyses and for studying both individuals and families. The central focus of the data has been economic and demographic, with substantial detail on income sources and amounts, employment, family composition changes, and residential location. Based on findings in the early years, the PSID expanded to its present focus on family structure and dynamics as well as income, wealth, and expenditures. Wealth and health are other important contributors to individual and family well-being that have been the focus of the PSID in recent years. The PSID wealth modules measure net equity in homes and nonhousing assets divided into six categories: other real estate and vehicles; farm or business ownership; stocks, mutual funds, investment trusts, and stocks held in IRAs; checking and savings accounts, CDs, treasury bills, savings bonds, and liquid assets in IRAs; bonds, trusts, life insurance, and other assets; and other debts. The PSID measure of wealth excludes private pensions and rights to future Social security payments. Race and Hispanic origin: The PSID asks respondents if they are white, black, American Indian, Aleut, Eskimo, Asian, Pacific Islander, or another race. Respondents are allowed to choose more than one category. They are coded according to the first category mentioned. Only respondents who classified themselves as white or black are included in Table 10 on page 87. For information, contact: Population Projections The population projections for the United States are interim projections that take into account the results of Census 2000. These interim projections were created using the cohort-component method, which uses assumptions about the components of population change. They are based on Census Appendix B 1432000 results, official postcensus estimates, as well as vital registration data from the National Center for Health Statistics. The assumptions are based on those used in the projections released in 2000 that used a 1998 population estimate base. Some modifications were made to the assumptions so that projected values were consistent with estimates from 2001 as well as census 2000. Fertility is assumed to increase slightly from current estimates. The projected total fertility rate in 2025 is 2.180, and it is projected to increase to 2.186 by 2050. mortality is assumed to continue to improve over time. By 2050, life expectancy at birth is assumed to increase to 81.2 for men and 86.7 for women. net immigration is assumed to be 996,000 in 2025 and 1,097,000 in 2050. Race and Hispanic origin: interim projections based on census 2000 were also done by race and Hispanic origin. The basic assumptions by race used in the previous projections were adapted to reflect the Census 2000 race definitions and results. Projections were developed for the following groups: (1) non-Hispanic white alone, (2) Hispanic white alone, (3) black alone, (4) Asian alone, and (5) all other groups. The fifth category includes the categories of American Indian and Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian and Other Pacifc Islander, and all people reporting more than one of the major race categories defined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). For a more detailed discussion of the cohort- component method and the assumptions about the components of population change, see \"Methodology and Assumptions for the Population Projections of the United States: 1999 to 2100.\" 55 While this paper does not incorporate the updated assumptions made for the interim projections, it provides a more extensive treatment of the earlier projections, released in 2000, on which the interim series is based.

The survey included a wide range of questions on health insurance, medical care costs, income, assets and liabilities, labor force participation and work experience, housing and food expenses, and living arrangements. The sample consisted of a representative subsample (one-half) of the Current Population Survey (CPS) sample and the full Quarterly Household survey. income was measured using answers to 17 questions about specific sources. Results from this survey have been combined with CPS results from 1971 to the present in an income time series produced by ssA.

Major issues addressed by the study include the adequacy of Old-Age, Survivors, Disability, and Health Insurance benefit levels, the impact of certain Social Security provisions on the incomes of the older population, and the extent to which other sources of income are received by older Americans. Data for the 1968 survey were obtained as a supplement to the Current Medicare Survey, which yields current estimates of health care Appendix B 144services used and charges incurred by people covered by the hospital insurance and supplemental medical insurance programs. supplemental questions covered work experience, household relationships, income, and assets. Income was measured using answers to 17 questions about specific sources. Results from this survey have been combined with results from the Current Population Survey from 1971 to the present in an income time series produced by ssA. Race and Hispanic origin: Data from this survey are not shown by race and Hispanic origin in this report.

Previous surveys of VHA-enrolled veterans were conducted in 1999, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2005, and 2007. All seven VHA surveys of enrollees consisted of telephone interviews with stratified random samples of enrolled veterans. From 2000 on, the survey instrument was modified to reflect V A management's need for specific data and information on enrolled veterans. As with the other surveys in the series, the 2008 Survey of Veteran Enrollees' Health and Reliance Upon V A sample was stratified by Veterans integrated service network, enrollment priority, and type of enrollee (new or past user). Telephone interviews averaged 17 minutes in length. In the 2008 survey, interviews were conducted beginning on september 25, 2008, over a course of 11 weeks. Of approximately 7.3 million eligible enrollees who had not declined enrollment as of April 30, 2008, some 42,000 completed interviews in the 2008 telephone survey. VHA enrollee surveys provide a fundamental source of data and information on enrollees that cannot be obtained in any other way except through surveys and yet are basic to many VHA activities. The primary purpose of the VHA enrollee surveys is to provide critical inputs into VHA Health Care services demand model enrollment, patient, and expenditure projections, and the Secretary's enrollment level decision processes; however, data from the enrollee surveys find their way into a variety of strategic analysis areas related to budget, policy, or legislation. VHA enrollee surveys provide particular value in terms of their ability to help identify not only who V A serves but also to help supplement V A's knowledge of veteran enrollees' sociodemographic, economic, and health characteristics, including household income, health insurance coverage status, functional status (limitations in activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living), perceived health status, race and ethnicity, employment status, smoking status, period of service and combat status, other eligibilities and resources, their use of V A and non-V A health care services and \"reliance\" upon V A, and their potential future use of V A health care services. For more information, contact: Population and Projections (model name is VetPop2007 (December 2007) VetPop2007 provides estimates and projections of the veteran population by age groups and other demographic characteristics at the county and state levels. Veteran estimates and projections were computed using a cohort-component approach, whereby Census 2000 baseline data were adjusted forward in time on the basis of separations from the Armed Forces (new veterans) and expected mortality. Race and Hispanic origin: Data from this model are not shown by race and Hispanic origin in this report. For more information, contact: living (ADLs): Activities of daily living (ADLs) are basic activities that support survival, including eating, bathing, and toileting. see instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). In the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey, ADL disabilities are measured as difficulty performing (or inability to perform because of a health reason) one or more of the following activities: eating, getting in/out of chairs, walking, dressing, bathing, or toileting. Asset income: Asset income includes money income reported in the Current Population Survey from interest (on savings or bonds), dividends, income from estates or trusts, and net rental income. capital gains are not included. Assistive device: Assistive device refers to any item, piece of equipment, or product system, whether acquired commercially, modified, or customized, that is used to increase, maintain, or improve functional capabilities of individuals with disabilities. Body mass index: Body mass index (BMI) is a measure of body weight adjusted for height and correlates with body fat. A tool for indicating weight status in adults, BMI is generally computed using metric units and is defined as weight divided by height2 or kilograms/meters2. The categories used in this report are consistent with those set by the World Health Organization. For adults 20 years of age and over, underweight is defined as having a BMI less than 18.5; healthy weight is defined as having a BMI of at least 18.5 and less than 25; overweight is defined as having values of BMI equal to 25 or greater; and obese is defined as having BMI values equal to 30 or greater. To calculate your own body mass index, go to http://www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi. For more information about BMI, see \"Clinical guidelines on the identification, evaluation, and treatment of overweight and obesity in adults.\"56 Cash balance pension plan: A hybrid pension plan that looks like a defined-contribution plan but actually is a defined-benefit plan, a responsibility of the employer. In a cash balance plan, an employer establishes an account for employees, contributes to the account, guarantees a return to the account, and pays a lump sum benefit from the account at job termination.Cause of death: For the purpose of national mortality statistics, every death is attributed to one underlying condition, based on information reported on the death certificate and using the international rules for selecting the underlying cause-of-death from the conditions stated on the death certificate. The conditions that are not selected as underlying cause of death constitute the nonunderlying cause of death, also known as multiple cause of death. Cause of death is coded according to the appropriate revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). Effective with deaths occurring in 1999, the United States began using the Tenth Revision of the ICD (ICD-10). Data from earlier time periods were coded using the appropriate revision of the ICD for that time period. Changes in classification of causes of death in successive revisions of the icd may introduce discontinuities in cause-of- death statistics over time. These discontinuities are measured using comparability ratios. These measures of discontinuity are essential to the interpretation of mortality trends. For further discussion, see the \"Mortality Technical Appendix\" available at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/statab/ techap99.pdf. Cause-of-death ranking: The cause-of-death ranking for adults is based on the List of 113 Selected Causes of Death. The top-ranking causes determine the leading causes of death. Certain causes on the tabulation lists are not ranked if, for example, the category title represents a group title (such as \"Major cardiovascular diseases\" and \"Symptoms, signs, and abnormal clinical and laboratory findings, not elsewhere classified\") or the category title begins with the words \"Other\" and \"All other.\" In addition, when a title that represents a subtotal (such as \"Malignant neoplasm\") is ranked, its component parts are not ranked. Causes that are tied receive the same rank; the next cause is assigned the rank it would have received had the lower-ranked causes not been tied (i.e., they skip a rank). Cigarette smoking: information about cigarette smoking in the National Health Interview Survey is obtained for adults age 18 and over. Although there has been some variation in question wording, smokers continue to be defined as people who have ever smoked 100 cigarettes and currently smoke. Starting in 1993, current smokers are identified by asking the following two questions: \"Have Appendix C 147you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your entire life?\" and \"Do you now smoke cigarettes every day, some days, or not at all?\" (revised definition). People who smoked 100 cigarettes and who now smoke every day or some days are defined as current smokers. Before 1992, current smokers were identified based on positive responses to the following two questions: \"Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your entire life?\" and \"Do you smoke now?\" (traditional definition). In 1992, cigarette smoking data were collected for a half sample with one-half the respondents (a one-quarter sample) using the traditional smoking questions and the other half of respondents (a one-quarter sample) using the revised smoking question. An unpublished analysis of the 1992 traditional smoking measure revealed that the crude percentage of current smokers age 18 and over remained the same as in 1991. The statistics reported for 1992 combined data collected using the traditional and the revised questions. The information obtained from the two smoking questions listed above is combined to create the variables represented in Tables 26a and 26b on pages 111 and 112. Current smoker: There are two categories of current smokers: people who smoke every day and people who smoke only on some days. Former smoker: This category includes people who have smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetimes but currently do not smoke at all. Nonsmoker: This category includes people who have never smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime. Death rate: The death rate is calculated by dividing the number of deaths in a population in a year by the midyear resident population. For census years, rates are based on unrounded census counts of the resident population as of April 1. For the noncensus years of 1981-1989 and 1991, rates are based on national estimates of the resident population as of July 1, rounded to the nearest thousand. Starting in 1992, rates are based on unrounded national population estimates. Rates for the Hispanic and non-Hispanic white populations in each year are based on unrounded state population estimates for states in the Hispanic reporting area through 1996. Beginning in 1997, all states reported Hispanic origin. Death rates are expressed as the number of deaths per 100,000 people. The rate may be restricted to deaths in specific age, race, sex, or geographic groups or from specific causes of death (specific rate), or it may be related to the entire population (crude rate). Dental services: In the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (Indicators 30 and 34), the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), and the data used from the MEPS predecessor surveys used in this report (Indicator 33) this category covers expenses for any type of dental care provider, including general dentists, dental hygienists, dental technicians, dental surgeons, orthodontists, endodontists, and periodontists. Earnings: earnings are considered money income reported in the Current Population Survey from wages or salaries and net income from self-employment (farm and nonfarm). Emergency room services: In the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) and the data used from the MEPS predecessor surveys used in this report (Indicator 33), this category includes expenses for visits to medical providers seen in emergency rooms (except visits resulting in a hospital admission). These expenses include payments for services covered under the basic facility charge and those for separately billed physician services. In the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (Indicators 30 and 34) emergency room services are included as a hospital outpatient service unless they are incurred immediately prior to a hospital stay, in which case they are included as a hospital inpatient service. Fee-for-service: This is the method of reimbursing health care providers on the basis of a fee for each health service provided to the insured person. Functional Limitations: see Activities of daily living (ADLs) and Instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). Group quarters: For Census 2000, the U.S. Census Bureau classified all people not living in households as living in group quarters. There are two types of group quarters: institutional (e.g., correctional facilities, nursing homes, and mental hospitals) and noninstitutional (e.g., college dormitories, military barracks, group homes, missions, and shelters).Appendix C 148Head of household: In the Consumer Expenditure Survey head of household is defined as the first person mentioned when the respondent is asked to name the person or people who own or rent the home in which the consumer unit resides. In the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (within each wave of data), each family unit has only one current head of household (Head). Originally, if the family contained a husband-wife pair, the husband was arbitrarily designated the Head to conform with U.S. Census Bureau definitions in effect at the time the study began. The person designated as Head may change over time as a result of other changes affecting the family. When a new Head must be chosen, the following rules apply: The Head of the family unit must be at least 16 years old and the person with the most financial responsibility for the family unit. If this person is female and she has a husband in the family unit, then he is designated as Head. If she has a boyfriend with whom she has been living for at least 1 year, then he is Head. However, if the husband or boyfriend is incapacitated and unable to fulfill the functions of Head, then the family unit will have a female Head. Health care expenditures: In the Consumer Expenditure Survey (Indicator 12), health care expenditures include out-of-pocket expenditures for health insurance, medical services, prescription drugs, and medical supplies. In the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (Indicators 30 and 34), health care expenditures include all expenditures for inpatient hospital, medical, nursing home, outpatient (including emergency room visits), dental, prescription drugs, home health care, and hospice services, including both out-of-pocket expenditures and expenditures covered by insurance. Personal spending for health insurance premiums is excluded. In the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) and the data used from the MEPS predecessor surveys used in this report (Indicator 33), health care expenditures refers to payments for health care services provided during the year. (Data from the 1987 survey have been adjusted to permit comparability across years; see Zuvekas and Cohen. 51) Out-of-pocket health care expenditures are the sum of payments paid to health care providers by the person, or the person's family, for health care services provided during the year. Health care services include inpatient hospital, hospital emergency room, and outpatient department care; dental services; office-based medical provider services; prescription drugs; home health care; and other medical equipment and services. Personal spending for health insurance premium(s) is excluded. Health maintenance organization (HMO): An HMO is a prepaid health plan delivering comprehensive care to members through designated providers, having a fixed monthly payment for health care services, and requiring members to be in a plan for a specified period of time (usually 1 year). Hispanic origin: See specific data source descriptions in Appendix B.Home health care/services/visits: Home health care is care provided to individuals and families in their places of residence for promoting, maintaining, or restoring health or for minimizing the effects of disability and illness, including terminal illness. In the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey and Medicare claims data (Indicators 29, 30, and 34), home health care refers to skilled nursing care, physical therapy, speech language pathology services, occupational therapy, and home health aide services provided to homebound patients. In the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (Indicator 33), home health care services are classified into the \"Other health care\" category and are considered any paid formal care provided by home health agencies and independent home health providers. Services can include visits by professionals including nurses, doctors, social workers, and therapists, as well as home health aids, homemaker services, companion services, and home-based hospice care. Home care provided free of charge (informal care by family members) is not included. Hospice care/services: Hospice care is a program of palliative and supportive care services providing physical, psychological, social, and spiritual care for dying persons, their families, and other loved ones by a hospice program or agency. Hospice services are available in home and inpatient settings. In the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) (Indicators 30 and 34) hospice care includes only those services provided as part of a Medicare benefit. In MCBS Indicator 30 (Medicare) hospice services are included as part of the \"Other\" category. In MCBS Indicator 34 (Medicare) hospice services Appendix C 149are included as a separate category. In the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) (Indicator 33) hospice care provided in the home (regardless of the source of payment) is included in the \"Other health care\" category, while hospice care provided in an institutional setting (e.g., nursing home) is excluded from the MEPS universe. Hospital care: Hospital care in the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (Indicator 33) includes hospital inpatient care and care provided in hospital outpatient departments and emergency rooms. Care can be provided by physicians or other health practitioners; payments for hospital care include payments billed directly by the hospital and those billed separately by providers for services provided in the hospital. Hospital inpatient services: In the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (Indicators 30 and 34) hospital inpatient services include room and board and all hospital diagnostic and laboratory expenses associated with the basic facility charge, and emergency room expenses incurred immediately prior to inpatient stays. Expenses for hospital stays with the same admission and discharge dates are included if the Medicare bill classified the stay as an \"inpatient\" stay. Payments for separate billed physician inpatient services are excluded. In the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (Indicator 33) these services include room and board and all hospital diagnostic and laboratory expenses associated with the basic facility charge, payments for separately billed physician inpatient services, and emergency room expenses incurred immediately prior to inpatient stays. Expenses for reported hospital stays with the same admission and discharge dates are also included. Hospital outpatient services: These services in the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (Indicators 30 and 34) include visits to both physicians and other medical providers seen in hospital outpatient departments or emergency rooms (provided the emergency room visit does not result in an inpatient hospital admission), as well as diagnostic laboratory and radiology services. Payments for these services include those covered under the basic facility charge. Expenses for in-patient hospital stays with the same admission and discharge dates and classified on the Medicare bill as \"outpatient\" are also included. Separately billed physician services are excluded.Hospital stays: Hospital stays in the Medicare claims data (Indicator 29) refers to admission to and discharge from a short-stay acute care hospital. Housing cost burden: In the American Housing Survey, housing cost burden is defined as expenditures on housing utilities in excess of 30 percent of reported income. Housing expenditures: In the Consumer Expenditure Survey's Interview Survey, housing expenditures include payments for mortgage interest; property taxes; maintenance, repairs, insurance, and other expenses; rent; rent as pay (reduced or free rent for a unit as a form of pay); maintenance, insurance, and other expenses for renters; and utilities. Incidence: Incidence is the number of cases of disease having their onset during a prescribed period of time. It is often expressed as a rate. For example, the incidence of measles per 1,000 children ages 5 to 15 during a specified year. Incidence is a measure of morbidity or other events that occur within a specified period of time. see Prevalence. Income: In the Current Population Survey, income includes money income (prior to payments for personal income taxes, Social Security, union dues, Medicare deductions, etc.) from: (1) money wages or salary; (2) net income from nonfarm self-employment; (3) net income from farm self-employment; (4) Social Security or Railroad Retirement; (5) Supplemental Security Income; (6) public assistance or welfare payments; (7) interest (on savings or bonds); (8) dividends, income from estates or trusts, or net rental income; (9) veterans' payment or unemployment and worker's compensation; (10) private pensions or government employee pensions; and (11) alimony or child support, regular contributions from people not living in the household, and other periodic income. Certain money receipts such as capital gains are not included. In the Medicare Current Beneficiary Study, income is for the sample person, or the sample person and spouse if the sample person was married at the time of the survey. All sources of income from jobs, pensions, Social Security benefits, Railroad Retirement and other retirement income, Appendix C 150supplemental security income, interest, dividends, and other income sources are included. Income categories: Two income categories were used to examine out-of-pocket health care expenditures using the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) and MEPS predecessor survey data. The categories were expressed in terms of poverty status (i.e., the ratio of the family's income to the federal poverty thresholds for the corresponding year), which controls for the size of the family and the age of the head of the family. The income categories were (1) poor and near poor and (2) other income. Poor and near poor income category includes people in families with income less than 100 percent of the poverty line, including those whose losses exceeded their earnings, resulting in negative income (i.e., the poor), as well as people in families with income from 100 percent to less than 125 percent of the poverty line (i.e., the near poor). Other income category includes people in families with income greater than or equal to 125 percent of the poverty line. See Income, household. Income, household: Household income from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) and the MEPS predecessor surveys used in this report was created by summing personal income from each household member to create family income. Family income was then divided by the number of people that lived in the household during the year to create per capita household income. Potential income sources asked about in the survey interviews include annual earnings from wages, salaries, withdrawals; Social Security and V A payments; Supplemental Security Income and cash welfare payments from public assistance; Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, formerly known as Aid to Families with Dependent Children; gains or losses from estates, trusts, partnerships, C corporations, rent, and royalties; and a small amount of other income. See Income categories. Income fifths: A population can be divided into groups with equal numbers of people based on the size of their income to show how the population differs on a characteristic at various income levels. Income fifths are five groups of equal size, ordered from lowest to highest income. Inpatient hospital: see Hospital inpatient services.Institutions: For Census 2000, the U.S. Census Bureau defined institutions as correctional insti- tutions; nursing homes; psychiatric hospitals; hospitals or wards for chronically ill or for the treatment of substance abuse; schools, hospitals or wards for the mentally retarded or physically handicapped; and homes, schools, and other institutional settings providing care for children. 64 see Population. Institutionalized population: see Population. Instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs): IADLs are indicators of functional well-being that measure the ability to perform more complex tasks than the related activities of daily living (ADLs). See Activities of daily living (ADLs). In the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey. IADLs are measured as difficulty performing (or inability to perform because of a health reason) one or more of the following activities: heavy housework, light housework, preparing meals, using a telephone, managing money, or shopping. Long-term care facility: In the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) (Indicators 20 and 36), a residence (or unit) is considered a long-term care facility if it is certified by Medicare or Medicaid; has three or more beds and is licensed as a nursing home or other long-term care facility and provides at least one personal care service; or provides 24-hour, 7-day-a-week supervision by a non-family, paid caregiver. in mcBs (indicators 30 and 34), a long-term care facility excludes \"short-term institutions\" (e.g., sub-acute care) stays. See Short-term institution (Indicators 30 and 34), and Skilled nursing home (Indicator 29). Mammography: Mammography is an x-ray image of the breast used to detect irregularities in breast tissue. Mean: The mean is an average of n numbers computed by adding the numbers and dividing by n. Median: The median is a measure of central tendency, the point on the scale that divides a group into two parts. Medicaid: This nationwide health insurance program is operated and administered by the states, with federal financial participation. Within certain broad, federally determined guidelines, Appendix C 151states decide who is eligible; the amount, duration, and scope of services covered; rates of payment for providers; and methods of administering the program. Medicaid pays for health care services, community-based supports, and nursing home care for certain low-income people. medicaid does not cover all low-income people in every state. The program was authorized in 1965 by Title XIX of the Social Security Act. Medicare: This nationwide program provides health insurance to people age 65 and over, people entitled to social security disability payments for 2 years or more, and people with end-stage renal disease, regardless of income. The program was enacted July 30, 1965, as Title XVIII, Health Insurance for the Aged of the Social Security Act, and became effective on July 1, 1966. Medicare covers acute care services and post-acute care settings such as rehabilitation and long-term care hospitals, and generally does not cover nursing home care. Prescription drug coverage began in 2006. Medicare Advantage: see medicare Part c. Medicare Part A: medicare Part A (Hospital Insurance) covers inpatient care in hospitals, critical access hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, and other post-acute care settings such as rehabilitation and long-term care hospitals. It also covers hospice and some home health care. Medicare Part B: medicare Part B (medical Insurance) covers doctors' services, outpatient hospital care, and durable medical equipment. It also covers some other medical services that Medicare Part A does not cover, such as physical and occupational therapy and some home health care. medicare Part B also pays for some supplies when they are medically necessary. Medicare Part C: With the passage of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Medicare beneficiaries were given the option to receive their Medicare benefits through private health insurance plans, instead of through the original Medicare plan (Parts A and B). These plans were known as \"Medicare+Choice\" or \"Part C\" plans. Pursuant to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, the types of plans allowed to contract with Medicare were expanded, and the Medicare Choice program became known as \"Medicare Advantage.\" In addition to offering comparable coverage to Part A and Part B, medicare Advantage plans may also offer Part d coverage. Medicare Part D: medicare Part d subsidizes the costs of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. It was enacted as part of the medicare Prescription drug, improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) and went into effect on January 1, 2006. Beneficiaries can obtain the Medicare drug benefit through two types of private plans: beneficiaries can join a Prescription Drug Plan (PDP) for drug coverage only or they can join a Medicare Advantage plan (MA) that covers both medical services and prescription drugs (MA-PD). Alternatively, beneficiaries may receive drug coverage through a former employer, in which case the former employer may qualify for a retiree drug subsidy payment from medicare. Medigap: See Supplemental health insurance. National population adjustment matrix: The national population adjustment matrix adjusts the population to account for net underenumeration. Details on this matrix can be found on the U.S. Census Bureau website: http://www.census.gov/ population/www/censusdata/adjustment.html. Obesity: See Body mass index. Office-based medical provider services: In the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (Indicator 33) this category includes expenses for visits to physicians and other health practitioners seen in office-based settings or clinics. Other health practitioner includes audiologists, optometrists, chiropractors, podiatrists, mental health professionals, therapists, nurses, and physician's assistants, as well as providers of diagnostic laboratory and radiology services. services provided in a hospital based setting, including outpatient department services, are excluded. Other health care: In the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (Indicator 34), this category includes \"short-term institution,\" \"hospice,\" and \"dental\" services. In the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) (Indicator 33) other health care includes \"home health services\" (formal care provided by home health agencies and independent home health providers) and other medical equipment and services. The latter includes expenses for eyeglasses, contact lenses, Appendix C 152ambulance services, orthopedic items, hearing devices, prostheses, bathroom aids, medical equipment, disposable supplies, alterations/modifications, and other miscellaneous items or services that were obtained, purchased, or rented during the year. Other income: Other income is total income minus retirement benefits, earnings, asset income, and public assistance. it includes, but is not limited to, unemployment compensation, worker's compensation, alimony, and child support. Outpatient hospital: see Hospital outpatient services.Out-of-pocket health care costs: These are health care costs that are not covered by insurance. Overweight: See Body mass index.Pensions: Pensions include money income reported in the Current Population Survey from railroad retirement, company or union pensions (including profit sharing and 401(k) payments), IRAs, Keoghs, regular payments from annuities and paid-up life insurance policies, federal government pensions, U.S. military pensions, and state or local government pensions. Physician/Medical services: In the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (Indicator 34), this category includes visits to a medical doctor, osteopathic doctor, and health practitioner as well as diagnostic laboratory and radiology services. Health practitioners include audiologists, optometrists, chiropractors, podiatrists, mental health professionals, therapists, nurses, paramedics, and physician's assistants. Services provided in a hospital-based setting, including outpatient department services, are included. Physician/Outpatient hospital: In the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (Indicator 30), this term refers to \"physician/medical services\" combined with \"hospital outpatient services.\" Physician visits and consultations: in medicare claims data (Indicator 29) physician visits and consultations include visits and consultations with primary care physicians, specialists, and chiropractors in their offices, hospitals (inpatient and outpatient), emergency rooms, patient homes, and nursing homes.Population: Data on populations in the United States are often collected and published according to several different definitions. Various statistical systems then use the appropriate population for calculating rates. Resident population: The resident population of the United States includes people resident in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. It excludes residents of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and residents of the outlying areas under United States sovereignty or jurisdiction (principally American Samoa, Guam, Virgin Islands of the United States, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands). The definition of residence conforms to the criterion used in Census 2000, which defines a resident of a specified area as a person \"usually resident\" in that area. The resident population includes people resident in a nursing home and other types of institutional settings, but excludes the U.S. Armed Forces overseas, as well as civilian U.S. citizens whose usual place of residence is outside the United States. As defined in \"Indicator 6: Older Veterans,\" the resident population includes Puerto rico. Resident noninstitutionalized population: The resident noninstitutionalized population is the resident population not residing in institutions. For Census 2000, institutions, as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau, included correctional institutions; nursing homes; psychiatric hospitals; hospitals or wards for chronically ill or for the treatment of substance abuse; homes and schools, hospitals or wards for the mentally retarded or physically handicapped; and homes, schools, and other institutional settings providing care for children. People living in noninstitutional group quarters are part of the resident noninstitutionalized population. For Census 2000, noninstitutional group quarters included group homes (i.e., community-based homes that provide care and supportive services); residential facilities \"providing protective oversight ... to people with disabilities\"; worker and college dormitories; military and religious quarters; and emergency and transitional shelters with sleeping facilities. 64 Civilian population: The civilian population is the U.S. resident population not in the active duty Armed Forces. Civilian noninstitutionalized population: The civilian noninstitutionalized population is the Appendix C 153civilian population not residing in institutions.

Each family (including single-person households) is assigned a poverty threshold based upon the family's income, size of the family, and ages of the family members. All family members have the same poverty status. Several of the indicators included in this report include a poverty status measure.

Indicator 8: Income: The income categories are derived from the ratio of the family's income (or an unrelated individual's income) to the poverty threshold. Being in poverty is measured as income less than 100 percent of the poverty threshold. Low income is between 100 percent and 199 percent of the poverty threshold (i.e., $9,944 and $19,887 for one person age 65 and over in 2007). Middle income is between 200 percent and 399 percent of the poverty threshold (i.e., between $19,888 and $39,775 for one person age 65 and over in 2007). High income is 400 percent or more of the poverty threshold. Indicator 22: Mammography and Indicator 32: Sources of Health Insurance: Below poverty is defined as less than 100 percent of the poverty threshold. Above poverty is grouped into two categories: (1) 100 percent to less than 200 percent of the poverty threshold and (2) 200 percent of the poverty threshold or greater. Indicator 33: Out-of-Pocket Health Care Expenditures: Below poverty is defined as less than 100 percent of the poverty threshold. People are classified into the poor/near poor income category if the person's household income is below 125 percent of the poverty level. People are classified into the other income category if the person's household income is equal to or greater than 125 percent of the poverty level.
