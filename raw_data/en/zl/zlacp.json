They may offer therapeutic benefits when people use them as complementary medicine. Herbal medicines contain active ingredients from natural plants. Their use [dates back](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2374373517706612) thousands of years, even before the invention of conventional medicine. While many people prefer herbal medicines to some doctor-prescribed medications, others may use them in combination with prescription and nonprescription drugs. This article outlines the different types of herbal medicines, their uses, safety precautions, and when to contact a doctor. [Herbal medicines](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK536964/) They are part of a [category](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2374373517706612) of treatments called complementary and alternative medicine. Currently, thousands of herbal medicine products are available over the counter in the United States. Research from a [2018 focus-group study](https://bmccomplementmedtherapies.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12906-018-2160-6) - treat mild and moderate conditions - start treatment before taking conventional medicine Other common uses include: - boosting the [immune system](/articles/320721) - increasing energy [losing weight](/articles/322345) - enhancing mood [improving sleep](/articles/325303) However, a 2017 report published in the [Journal of Patient Experience](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2374373517706612) notes that factors associated with the use of herbal medicine include: - age older than 70 - educational qualifications above high school - over-the-counter (OTC) medication use - use of a mail-order pharmacy The [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/initiatives/who-global-centre-for-traditional-medicine) [aspirin](/articles/161255) and artemisinin, originated from herbal medicine. How a person takes herbal supplements depends on the form. They [are available](https://medlineplus.gov/herbalmedicine.html) as tablets, capsules, teas, powders, extracts, and fresh or dried plants. A person can take herbal supplements by: - swallowing them as pills, powders, or tinctures - applying them to the skin as gels and lotions - adding them to bathwater - drinking them as teas Dosages for some herbal supplements may be challenging to get right. Many factors can affect the quality of herbal supplements, including the growing conditions, age, and preparation of the plant. As a result, there is no standardized way to provide a correct dosage. If a person considers taking an herbal supplement, they should [avoid self-prescribing](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/know-science/how-medications-supplements-interact) The doctor will ask questions about a person's health condition and determine the best dosage for the desired pharmacological effect. Because conventional medical doctors may not have received much education regarding herbal medicine, a person may instead want to consult a [licensed naturopathic doctor](https://naturopathic.org), a [licensed acupuncturist](http://www.nccaom.org), or another qualified practitioner of herbal medicine. A person should talk with a doctor before taking herbal medicine. The [National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/know-science/how-medications-supplements-interact/page-3) [drug interactions](https://www.poison.org/articles/mixing-meds-herbs-and-supplements) they need to be careful of. Safe use of herbal medicine also includes: - following label instructions carefully - taking only the recommended dosage - stopping taking an herbal supplement if it is ineffective The United Kingdom's [National Health Service (NHS)](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/herbal-medicines/) notes that taking herbal medicine may not be suitable for a person if they are: - pregnant [breastfeeding](/articles/breastfeeding) - taking other prescription or OTC medications - over age 65 - under age 18 - having surgery The NHS also notes that anyone taking herbal medicine should disclose it to their doctor before surgery. This is because some herbal medicines may interact with anesthesia drugs and affect [blood pressure](/articles/270644) and blood clotting during and after surgery. Some people use herbal supplements to treat specific symptoms, though there is not much formal research on these uses. The table below lists some herbal supplements and some conditions that they may benefit. Using supplements can be unsafe for people who have certain health conditions or take medications. People who are breastfeeding or pregnant may want to avoid herbal supplements, as there is very little research on their effects. Always consult a doctor before taking herbal supplements. |Herbal supplement||What might it help?||Precautions and potential side [psoriasis](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/52457) [digestive problems](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/list-of-digestive-disorders) [may cause](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/aloe-vera) Oral aloe latex use may cause abdominal pain and cramping.

No, the FDA does not approve herbal medicines. This is because the FDA [does not](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/fda-101-dietary-supplements) As a result, herbal medicines are not subject to the same testing, labeling, and manufacturing standards as traditional prescription and OTC medications. However, the FDA regulates herbal medicines to ensure that they meet specific criteria and that they are not dangerous for human consumption. Is herbal medicine safe? Not necessarily. The [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/herbal-medicines/) warns that \"natural\" does not mean safe if a person uses a product without a doctor's prescription. This is because some herbs can have adverse drug interactions with other medications. Some may also cause fatal side effects. A person should always check with a doctor before taking supplements if they have a health condition or are taking prescribed medication. A person should discontinue using an herbal supplement and contact a doctor immediately if they experience any of the following symptoms: - nausea [dizziness](/articles/325251) - headache - swelling - upset stomach [breathing difficulty](/articles/324429) They should also seek medical advice if they take an overdose of an herbal supplement. If a person develops symptoms of a [severe allergic reaction](/articles/216062), they or other people around them should immediately call 911 or the local emergency number. According to a 2017 review published in [American Family Physician](https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2017/0715/p101.html), 40-60% of U.S. adults use dietary supplements, including herbal medicines, and 25% report taking herbal supplements with prescription medication. The authors note that many people who use herbal supplements do not disclose it to their doctors. This affects the clinical assessment and safety of specific herbal supplement-drug interactions. To help healthcare professionals better evaluate herbal supplement interactions in the body, a person should: - disclose any herbal supplements they are using to their doctor - document their symptoms - stop using herbal supplements if symptoms do not improve - avoid herbal supplement overdose - report any worsening symptoms to their doctor Herbal medicines or supplements are natural compounds made from plant parts. Manufacturers extract active ingredients from the plants' leaves, bark, roots, seeds, or flowers. Herbal supplements are available in many forms, such as pills, teas, extracts, and powders. People use them to treat chronic conditions, including anxiety, sleep problems, and low libido. Herbal supplements are not FDA-approved, and some natural products may be unsafe. Herbal supplements can cause adverse drug reactions, so a person must consult a doctor before taking them if they are also taking prescription medication. "}
