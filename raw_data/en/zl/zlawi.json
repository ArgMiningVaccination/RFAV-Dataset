Deaton: Research Paper: Aromatherapy and Elderly Care KG Stiles: Essential oils to balance the five elements Article Series: Wood Element Dr. Berkowsky: Powerful Soul Level Work with Essential Oils Book Review: The Aromatic Spa Book Dennis Willmont: Peppermint 3 I have recently been enjoying many wonderful books, devouring them actually! Many of them outside the realm of Aromatherapy as far as essential oils are concerned yet inclusive within the Holistic concept of health and wellness. I am inspired by the words and ideas of the masses and intrigued enough to motivate additional aspira- tions of my own. Understanding consciousness and welcoming reflections of myself mirrored in the exchange with others is fascinating. I learn so much when I am still and observe without influence of my emotive self and I question my mind and the thoughts I entertain. I am stronger and more aware than I have ever been before and I thank the many volunteers in my life who share with me that which I seek to know, myself \u2014more intimately, more completely more indulgingly. There is a poem you are likely familiar with by Erma Bombeck; \"If I had my life to live over again.\" I enjoy reading this from time to time and quoting it as a reminder to myself. I do believe truth is spoken for many and I know \"I would have more real problems and fewer imaginary ones.\" This poem inspires those of us who are still walking the earth in our physical bodies to be aware of how precious our Now is. I am happy to begin this now, being present and aware. I do also think I would rather enjoy eating dessert as my meal on occasion and perhaps those occasions would be a bit more frequent. I decided a long time ago that burning my pretty candles right now is as good of a time as any since special occasions are the heart of every moment. I believe I will take myself less seriously and the wear purple and red now \u2014why wait until my white hair comes forth? If I may have the opportunity now to kick fallen leaves on the ground, jump into a lake with my clothes on, camp in the wintertime, drink a glass of wine before it is noon anywhere and lay under the clouds while it is raining without the fear of catching cold looming over my head \u2014I will do so wholeheartedly and with great enthusiasm. Above all I will hold in my heart the power of knowing the love that I have been so honored to receive. I will take that love and share it freely with everyone I meet. As for the greatest of all of my endeavors, my achievements, my claims to fame it is love I cherish most. I have loved more deeply most truly and in the brilliance of bold color and have received it in return \u2014what greater gift can be shared? Without hesitation I will enthusiastically press my lips against the tenderness of love and know that it will gladly smooch back in equally dramatic fashion with every opportunity given. In delight and pleasure I bow to you and as I stand, my heart is filled with gratitude! Greetings from the President Michele A. Miller -Clarke \u00a9 Copyright 2008 NAHA All rights reserved 4 Kelly Holland Azzaro NAHA Vice President As a professional practitioner who works with her hands on a daily basis to give holistic therapies by way of aro- matherapy, reflexology, Swedish, therapeutic, clinical, hot stone, acupressure, lymphatic, cranial sacral, Reiki, facial and scalp massage for over twenty years, I sometimes take for granted how hard my hands really work for me and my clients. These hands of mine are strong yet soft to the touch from immersion of carrier oils and natu- ral scrubs, sculpted from years of accurate work and aged like a fine wine or better yet a rich essential oil. My work seems to develop each year as clients share how they benefit from the healing modality that massage and aromatherapy offers on many levels. I could easily forget that essential oils offer amazing therapeutic properties and a variety of applications as this is second nature. Then a client will ask Wow, what is that amazing scent on the tissue you put in the face cradle for me'. Simply put different for each client but here's a simple recipe, one drop of lavender and one drop of lemon, two of the most attainable and easy to use essential oils in aromatherapy on a tissue to help that client achieve relaxation and stress relief. The lemon also helps most client's to let go of the brain fog from a day or week filled of mental tasks and cluttered thoughts. The Lavender tops off the relaxation process by inducing a sense of peace and ability to breathe deeply and let go of tension. This gets me to wondering how come such easy going' scents elicit such instant changes in a client's shift from tense to rel axed, stressed to calm, chatty to snoring. Is it the instant aroma to brain reaction, the agreeability of the scent, the client's appreciation for th e extra benefit of essential oil therapy, or does the combination of say lavender and lemon just smell that good! Whatever it is and I'm sure it is a bit of a ll benefits combined. The effort of taking the time and energy to learn about true aromatherapy and how it can be added into so many holistic therapies , especially massage therapy for you and your client's benefit is surely something that is well worth the effort and investment. When times are stressful for clients and they come to you for the gift you give in your own healing hands, isn't is wonderful that you have an aro- matic tool kit filled with aromas of therapeutic value? Clients also give you the opportunity to grow and learn. Each session brings the potential to expand your awareness, essential oil applications, massage techniques and to generate the abundance of health, happiness and prosperity. Take a look at your hands and be grateful for the strength that they provide in your work, the gentleness they offer by exten ding a helping hand to someone in need, the wisdom in faith, love and life palm lines which show how far you have come in life and then the gift of passing it onto others by teaching. Hands are indeed healing tools on many levels.

My muse has me musing on the creativity of writing about Aromatherapy. Not only are there wonderful writers in the field of Aromatherapy, but essential oils have been a theme in writings as diverse and popu- lar literature and biblical stories. For example, Tom Robbins' great book Jitterbug Perfume ponders many profound is- sues in a comical way, including the impact of aroma and its connection to immortality. I highly recommend it. One the- matic thread is the quest for a secret ingredient in a formula/recipe that couples New Orleans voodoo queens and French perfumers. Interestingly, Tom lives and writes in a town not far from former NAHA Seattle headquarters,* and that's the city where the story begins. Coincidence? Books like The Da Vinci Code have helped stoke new interest in the true identity and nature of Mary Magdalene, which in turn sparked a greater interest in Spikenard, the oil she purportedly used to wash the feet of Jesus. References to es- sences in the Bible carry the symbolism of the subtle and energetic qualities. Spikenard, said by Gumble to be the only oil perfectly balanced between Yin and Yang may show Mary and Jesus, meeting at the foot of under -standing. This and other Bible references (...and the Lord said to Moses, Take one part myrrh...') helped me move students here in conser- vative South Carolina beyond the negative New Age label for Aromatherapy that some had been taught. How much more old age than Moses can you get? I ask them. They get it. The symbolism of Frankincense and Myrrh is easy to ab- sorb and the story of the Three Kings takes on new meaning. I wonder if anyone has ever done a study on references to essences in literature as a whole. Writing articles on Aromatherapy itself has proven to be rewarding and at times, challenging. Most reader comments on my regular column in Massage Today are positive, but I have stepped on some hot buttons, notably when writing on the use of Aromatherapy in treating Fibromyalgia. We all have opinions and it's the degree of our attachment to that position that can turn up the heat. The essences themselves are great allies when we need inspiration, clarity, grounding and also when it's time to cool down the emotional response. The writings of NAHA Directors and members have appeared in many journals and our community is lucky to have such wonderful talent, willing to share information, ideas, recipes and empirical evidence. My students in the Professional Aromatherapy Level II class are required to purchase an Aromatherapy journal and write a report on an article they've read. Reading publications is so important because no matter how wonderful a book or text may be, the ongoing developments and information in the field are not between those covers, but are provided in the current issues of aromatherapy publications. I look forward to reading the articles in our current issue and thank all our contributors, past, present and future!

Deaton, BA, IAC, ESMT Introduction: Across the United States and other modernized countries, the elderly population is at an all time high, due in part to modern pharmaceuticals that have diminished life threatening diseases such as tuberculosis and polio, as well as the advancement of medical diagnostic technology, which allows health care professionals to identify and proactively treat potential problems such as cardiac disease and diabetes mellitus. According to current statistics approximately 40 - 60 % of elderly nursing home residents suffer from dementia. It is estimated that Alzheimer's disease currently affects ap- proximately 5 million Americans. Along with dementia are other aging processes that affect their bodies. This document will provide clinical trial evidence that supports the effectiveness of aro- matherapy in the treatment of symptoms associated with dementia and other conditions associated with aging. Dementia: Dementia is a general term that describes a group of symptoms caused by the permanent damage or death of the brain's nerve cells or neurons. According to Murtagh, dementia can be characterized into four symptomatic groups. Deficit presentations characterized by loss of cognitive abilities encompassing: forgetfulness confusion/restlessness self neglect poor reasoning 2. Unsociable changes in personality such as: impulsiveness and/or risk taking behavior uninhibited behavior suspicious manner withdrawn behavior 3. Dysphoric presentations such as: depression insecurity lack of cooperation irritability 4. Disruptive behavior affecting others such as: aggression agitation coupled with restlessness One or more of several diseases have been found to cause dementia. Common causes are: 1. vascular dementia, caused by stroke or blockage of blood supply; 2. alcohol dementia which is caused by sustained use of alcohol; 3. trauma dementia cause d by head injuries and 4. a rare form of dementia known as frontotemporal. Alzheimer's represents approximately 60 % of all de- mentias. Although Alzheimer's disease is not a normal part of aging, the risk of developing the illness rises with age. Cur rent research from the National Institute on Aging indicates that the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease doubles every five years b e- yond the age of 65. Alzheimer's therefore is the most common cause of dementia today. Currently there is no cure for Alzheimer's or any dementia, but research continues to test the effectiveness of various drug thera- pies. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have approved five drugs for treatment of dementia and or Alz- heimer's disease. Four acetyl cholinesterase inhibitors marketed as Razadyne and Tacrine. fifth dru g, HCl derivative Namenda, is a neuropeptide modifying agent. With all pharmaceutical products, there is a po- tential for known and unknown side effects and risks. The known risks for these approved drugs include dizziness, headache, constipation, confusion, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, upset stomach, muscle weakness, bruising, insomnia, tiredne ss and muscle cramps. Along with the side effects of each drug is the potential for drug drug interactions, meaning the interac tion between all the different drugs an individual is taking. So, beside the complications of the disease, care givers and medica l pro- fessionals need to be cognizant of the implications of potential side effects and the patient's medications. For many years, health care professionals worldwide have recognized the benefits of using essential oils and other alternativ e complementary therapies to treat the elderly and dementia. Many documented cases and clinical trials have shown improvement Aromatherapy and Elderly Care Robin R. Deaton \u00a9 Copyright 2008 NAHA All rights reserved 8 in many of the symptoms of dementia and aging when incorporating complementary and alternative medicine to the traditional treatment regime. With the limited number of products on the market and the risks they pose to the patient, complementary alternative therapies are increasingly being explored among the medical profession. Insomnia Disruption of sleep is a common problem with dementia patients. Many trials have been conducted in subjects of all ages, as well as stages of dementia, to evaluate the effects of essential oils on insomnia. Of the studies I researched, the followin g oils (unspecified). In all studies, the patients were exposed to the essential oils via diffusion/inhalation. Some studies involved exposure to a single oil such as Lavendula augustifolia, while other studies evaluated several oils other than lavender. The results indicated that essential oils do help to promote and sustain a peaceful sleep. Specifically effective were Citrus aurantium, Lavendula augustifolia and Lavendula offici- nalis. In the event an individual doesn't care for the scent of Citrus auran- tium, Lavendula augustifolia, or Lavendula officinalis, other essential oils may be effective with insomnia are Ocimum basilicum, Santa- lum album, Cananga odorata and Citrus limon. Anxiety and Stress Stress in the elderly is often manifested in the form of anxiety and can be the result of moving the patient into unfamiliar surroundings such as a hospital or nursing home. Studies have shown that massage with aromatherapy have positive effects on anxiety, stress and self -esteem. In 2006 the Research Institute of Nursing Sciences, Seoul Korea, studied elderly women and the effects of unspecified varieties of lav- ender, chamomile, rosemary and lemon and massage on anxiety lev- els and self -esteem. The experimental/treatment group received 20 minute massages, 3 times per week over a three week period. The control group received nothing. The results suggested significant differences in the anxiety and self esteem levels when compared to the controls. Other essential oils that may also be effective for anxiety and stress states are Melissa officinalis, Cananga As many care givers are aware, some patients are not accepting of unfamiliar people touching them and need exposure to the oils in alternative ways. It is very likely that scent -memory association played a part in relieving the stress and anxiety of these patients. Modern re- search supports the human intuitive recognition of aromas or more commonly thought of as scent memory. Being able to illicit a memory of a specific event, time or place could be of particular importance for comforting these patients. Agitated Behavior Agitated behaviors among individuals with dementia are distressing to the patient and their care givers. The conventional pl an is to treat these behaviors with tranquilizers, but these may be of limited use because of potential side effects. Therefore , com- plimentary therapies are becoming very useful for these manifestations. In 2007, the Department of Occupational Therapy, Hong Kong, China conducted a randomized cross over trial in seventy Chinese adults with dementia. Lavender (L. angustifolia) was used for the treatment group and unscented sunflower oil as the placebo were administered via inhalation. The results of the trial indicated lavender to be an effective adjunctive therapy in alleviating agitated behaviors in Chinese patients with de- mentia. Aromatherapy and Elderly Care \u00a9 Copyright 2008 NAHA All rights reserved 9 In 2002, a double blind placebo controlled trial conducted in the United Kingdom by Dr. Clive Ballard and colleague's, tested the value of aromatherapy utilizing Melissa officinalis in people with severe dementia. Seventy two patients with clinically sign ificant agitation were randomized into two groups. Each group received aromatherapy treatment in the form of a lotion applied to the ir faces and arms. The treatment group received Melissa lotion and the control group received sunflower oil lotion. The result s were measured with Dementia Care Mapping (DCM). The results of this trial reported an overall improvement in agitation of 35% in the treatment group and 11% in the placebo group. Beshara and Giddings conducted non -randomized trials in 2002 utilizing unspecified aroma diffusion over a period of 1, 3 and 6 months. The frequency of aggressive behaviors in each person was calculated using the target behavior tracking forms gener- ated for the standardized Minimum Data Set (MDS) assessment tool. Over the 6 month trial period, results showed some partici- pants demonstrated a significant decrease in disturbed behavior as indicated by a 50% decrease in targeted behaviors. Others showed a less significant response, but still showed improvement. In 2005 a clinical trial conducted by the Department of Nursing, Kongju National University, Korea, studied the effects of la vender aromatherapy on cognitive function, emotion and aggressive behavior of elderly with dementia of the Alzheimer's type. The de- sign of this trial included three groups receiving hand massage treatment for two weeks. The treatments were either lavender oil, jojoba oil or no treatment at all. The results of this trial showed significant differences in emotion and aggressive behavi or with respect to the control and jojoba oil treatments. Significant differences in cognitive function among the three groups were n ot demonstrated. As demonstrated by these studies, aromatherapy is an effective alternative for significantly reducing agitated and aggressive behaviors in diverse populations with dementia. Of the oils studied, many other essential oils have similar properties inclu ding, Angelica archangelica rad, Cistus ladaniferus, Arthritis and Chronic Pain Arthritis can be classified into two main types. Rheumatoid arthritis is characterized by chronic inflammation of the connec tive tissue around the joints. This causes pain, swelling and stiffness which are frequently accompanied by weight loss and fatig ue. The second type is osteoarthritis and is characterized by progressive wearing away of the cartilage. The connective tissue t hick- ens and any fluid which may fill the joint causes swelling resulting in severe pain and reduced movement. Pain is one of the most important symptoms to consider and although conventional analgesics give some relief they seldom give complete or sustained relief. Essential oils have been used successfully, as indicated in the following clinical trial, to r educe in- flammation and pain in joint tissues, thereby providing increased mobility. In a clinical trial conducted by The College of Nursing in Korea, the effects of aromatherapy on pain, depression, feelings a nd life satisfaction of arthritis patients was tested. The study consisted of 40 patients and the administration of the following un specified varieties of: lavender, marjoram, eucalyptus, rosemary and peppermint blended in 2:1:2:1:1 proportions. Almond, apricot and jojoba oils were used to make a final concentration of 1.5%. The results of this trial indicated aromatherapy significantly de- creased both the pain score and the depression score of the experimental group compared to the control group. However, aro- matherapy didn't increase the feeling of satisfaction in life of the experimental group compared with the control group. Ove rall conclusion shows that aromatherapy has major effects on decreasing pain and depression levels. Other effective essential oils to consider for their analgesic effects are most effective application for this type of aromatherapy is a 1% dilution applied directly to the affected joint with a c ompress or a gentle massage. Warm baths are another effective option. Constipation Many elderly patients suffer from constipation, which is often a result of medications, poor diet, and lack of fluids and or exercise. Aromatherapy and Elderly Care \u00a9 Copyright 2008 NAHA All rights reserved 10 Aromatherapy massage has been shown to be effective in relieving constipation. In a placebo controlled study of elderly Kore an patients, the use of Rosmarinus officinalis, Citrus limon, and Mentha piperta coupled with abdominal massage proved effective in reliev ing constipa- tion. Other oils that may prove to be effective in the relief of constipation are Origanum marjorana, and Pinus sylvestris. These essential oils can be used in a synergistic blend or alon e. Wound Care In the elderly patient, paper thin skin is common due in part to poor circulation, poor nutrition, medication and age. Skin tears, pressure sores and other wounds are common among the elderly. Health care professionals worldwide have successfully treated these skin prob- lems using aromatherapy where conventional medicines have failed. Pressure sores have been effectively treated with cicatrizant oils such as Ca- lendula officinalis is a cicatrizant, anti -inflammatory as well as anti -infectious agent. When used as a carrier for the Calendu al officinalis is very effective on persistent ulcers and other wounds. It has also been noted that routine gentle massage of fragile skin will stimulate the tissue and strengthen it over time. Conclusion: As the evidence from the clinical trials have shown, alternative therapies are effective in treating the symptoms of the agin g. These thera- pies are not complicated or costly and can be administered from health care professionals or family members. What's more en couraging is the research that continues to look for effective ways of treating dementia. As recent as February 2008, researchers conc luded that ginkgo extract on dementia in the elderly appears to have a reduced risk of progression and a smaller decline in memory. Gra nted further research in larger patient populations is necessary, but for the moment the results are interesting. Finally, in the March 4, 2008 Annals of Internal Medicine, a committee representing the American College of Physicians (ACP) and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) reviewed the current dementia literature for outcomes such as cognition, global function, behavior/mood and quality of life activities. The group found that high -quality scientific evidence was limited and thereby the y developed cautious recommendation for administration of the five commonly used drugs. The group indicates the need for more research, because the evidence concerning the pharmaceuticals effects on quality of life is mixed and the clinical significance of many of the findings is ques- tionable. As evidence and research indicates, pharmaceuticals are not the only answer to the needs of our elderly. It's important to s eek out the proper treatment(s) that maintains a patient's quality of life. Most likely that regimen will be a combination of standard m edicine and com- plementary alternative therapies, where aromatherapy will play a beneficial role for both patient and care giver. ___________________________________________________________________________________________ If you are a student of Aromatherapy and have written a research paper please submit your work to info@naha.org for review \u2014 We look forward to hearing from you soon!

The choice of delivery method often depends on your intended goal. Here are some of the most practical and therapeutic methods for using your aromatic oils for b alancing the 5 elements. Direct inhalation is the method I primarily use in my practice. Research shows that aromatic vapors will remain in your bloodstream for up to 4 -6 hours. Essential Oils to Balance the Five Elements The Wood Element \u00a9 Copyright 2008 NAHA All rights reserved Author KG Stiles 13 PLEASE NOTE: Stimulating circulation of your blood, lymph and nerve flow through rhythmic breathing in conjunction with inhalation of aromatic oils enhances their delivery into your system! Steam Inhalation is one of the easiest and most direct ways to support your respiratory system with essential oils. Use steam inhalation to soothe and promote healing for your respiratory system, clearing nasal passages and enjoying therapeutic benefi ts for your lungs. Great method to prevent or treat respiratory infections, support your health and prevent colds and the flu. Add 4 -8 drops of oil to a large bowl of steaming hot water, but not so hot it will burn your skin or mucous membranes. Put a towel over your head to capture the steam. Close your eyes and inhale until the water cools or until you stop smelling the oil. Breathe in the steam for a few minutes, as long as you desire. Please keep your eyes closed to prevent any of the essential oil vapors from getting into your eyes! Repeat the treatment, if necessary, every 4 -5 hours. Relieves sinus congestion, coughs, colds, flu and sore throats. Suggested oils to use: eucalyptus, ravensara, lavender, peppermint, lemon and tea tree. Bathing is an age -old method for using aromatic oils to balance the 5 elements and is great for stress reduction, relaxation, soothing sore muscles and joints, supporting respiratory health, mood enhancement, and treating your senses to the full aroma of an essential oil. Fill your tub with water, add 5 -8 drops of oil that has been mixed in a dispersant such as a water soluble carrier oil, milk or cream, or a spoonful of honey, swish to disperse in the water. A half cup each of Epsom Salts (muscle relaxant, de- toxifier) and Baking Soda (skin softener) can also be used to disperse the oils in your bath water. PLEASE NOTE: Essential oils are not water soluble you must use a dispersant when adding them to a facial steam or bath and water may cause the oils to penetrate your system more quickly or cause irritation to sensitive or damaged skin, i.e. blemishes, sores or rash. Compress ~ Excellent for topical application to ease pain from strained muscles, menstrual cramps, etc. Disperse 4 -8 drops of oil in a teaspoon of milk or honey and add to a small stainless steel bowl of hot water. Absorb the \"HOT\" water into a wash clot h, using protective gloves, wring out excess water and apply compress to area of discomfort, repeat when your cloth cools. You may cover the warm cloth with a hot water bottle, plastic sheet or a towel to keep it \"HOT\" longer.

Essential Oils to Balance the Five Elements Wood Element \u00a9 Copyright 2008 NAHA All rights reserved 14 \u00a9 Copyright 2007 Joseph Ben Hil -Meyer Research, Inc. Bruce Berkowsky, N.M.D., M.H., H.M.C. Incipient Knowing During the mid -1990s, following twenty years of practice as a naturopath, herbalist and homeopath, despite consistently observing impressive improvement in a wide variety of physical and emotional disharmonies among my clients, an incipient knowing that these positive outcomes did not equate with true cure drove my work in a new direction. As a traditional naturopath, I developed my Natural Health Science System and naturally worked from the premise that the powe r to cure disease resides only within the patient's body, and that innate power cannot fully prevail until wrong living habits stop and the fundamental elements of life and health, in necessary measure, have been set in place, namely: proper diet; pure water; fresh air; sunlight; adequate exercise, warmth, rest and sleep; emotional harmony; proper posture. Accordingly, if a substance is not fundamental to the health of the body, it's also not fundamental to the treatment of disease. From this view comes the most important therapeutic principle of traditional naturopathy: Disease treatment must be based upon the use of the fundamental elements of life in accordance with the needs and abilities of the patient. As a classical homeopath, I was trained to avoid distraction by the presenting symptoms: superficial manifestations of an underly- ing pathological process and to focus instead upon the central disturbance. In chronic disease, the operative premise in classi- cal homeopathy is that while an individual's symptoms may primarily manifest physically, these nevertheless derive from a central disturbance which has emerged at the interface of the emotional and physical planes. Thus, effective selection of a homeopathic remedy in these cases requires that the practitioner look around the disease and see the person. Given my disciplined adherence to working fundamentally both naturopathically and homeopathically, I have been able to help many people in a profound way. Still, I sensed that I had to develop the capacity to work at an even deeper level in order to help guide people onto the path of true cure. My longtime interest in the spiritual realm led me to study a great deal of philosophy and spiritual writings, train in yoga and tai chi, practice meditation and daily prayer and spend many years living close to nature. Thus, I was keenly aware of the soul -level of existence. Accordingly, I came to the conclusion that to initiate the process of true cure, one had to engage with the hig her soul, restore its guidance of primary consciousness and encourage its full incarnation into tissues where it could then exert its formative influence upon the workings of the physical body. Self-Healing: A Centrifugal Process Ultimately, there is no separation between mind and body. The human organism is a fully integrated entity of mind, body and soul. The ongoing survival of this organism depends upon its capacity for self -healing which is a centrifugal process . In other words, the direction of cure is from the inside to the outside. As the emotional level is a deeper level than the physical, our unexpressed emotions will be transferred from the emotional l evel to the physical level (i.e., centrifugal movement from inside to outside). In this way, emotional disharmony morphs into phys ical disease. The first imperative of the organism is self -healing. Whatever is not processed and resolved on the emotional level wil l ultimately have to be expressed on the physical level or those bottled -up energies will cause an emotional meltdown. The physical body is vitalized and directed by higher forces, including what can be referred to as the spirit body. Ideally, the spirit body fully incarnates into living tissues and exerts an ongoing supervisory influence. When the human soul becomes preoccupie d with the daily challenges of life, rational consciousness becomes estranged from the higher self and mired in \"stuckness.\" Al l chronic diseases have in common this quality of inertia. Stuckness, a form of limitation, is a state of being that can only be associated with the finite realm. Therefore, overcoming stuck- ness requires the ongoing influence of the higher soul \u2014that aspect of the soul that has never become estranged from its infinite source. POWERFUL SOUL -LEVEL WORK WITH ESSENTIAL OILS \u00a9 Copyright 2008 NAHA All rights reserved 15 Epiphany: Using Plant Souls To Assist A Disoriented Human Soul Although I clearly recognized what was required to overcome this inertial state, I had not as yet determined how to consisten tly engage with the higher soul in an orderly fashion until an epiphany occurred while I was concomitantly studying anthroposophi cal medicine and the Kabbalah. Anthroposophical science teaches that plants produce fragrance as a means of absorbing \"the soul\" of the sun which contains the essence of spirit. Fragrance formation represents an interaction between terrestrial and cosmic forces, and it's used by the plant as a means of uniting with the spiritual essence contained within sunbeams. Anthroposophy founder Rudolf Steiner states: \"Matter is most spiritual in the perfume of the plant. When the spirit most closely approaches the physical earth, then we have the perception of fragrance.\" In other words, an essential oil is the most concentrated carrier of the plant's soul. This understanding, conflated with a key kabbalistic insight, turned on the light that illuminated for me a practical pathway to soul- level healing. The Kabbalah teaches that the scent of a plant represents the superconscious aspect of its soul. Whereas the t aste of a fruit, such as an orange, nourishes a person on a conscious level, the scent of its oil provides sustenance for his or h er spiri- tual dimension. According to Kabbalah, the human soul contains animal -, vegetable - and human soul components. Thus, each of us has the abil- ity to relate to plant souls on a soul -to-soul level. Plants are alive, and everything that lives has a soul. An essential oil, the bond- ing medium for the soul of the plant, is uniquely suited to act as the physical entity that can facilitate an interface betwe en plant and human souls. Based upon the interface of these two principles, I formed the following hypothesis: The plant -soul is not encumbered by ego, so it has the qualities of purity and infinity. Thus, an individualized plant -soul combination within an essential oil blend, when prof- fered to the human -soul, would be eagerly received and infuse the latter with the impetus to move beyond limitation by changing its orientation from the finite to the Infinite. I decided that the key to moving the soul in this way is the formulation of a customized essential oil blend that accurately reflects an individual's \"soul -print.\" Like fingerprints, each soul is unique. Living within the context of one's true soul -nature requir es con- tinuous connection with one's higher self. Happiness is the key to wellness. No unhappy person can truly be well. In turn, th e key to happiness lies in accepting, and living in accordance with, one's soul -print and having this soul -print received by others. The inability to actualize who we really are leads to anger, anxiety, frustration, depression, regret, etc. And these emotion s are often repressed, becoming morbidly introverted emotional cysts. Our bottled -up emotional cysts hold us back physically as well as emotionally. Life-Change Through A Change In Perspective The famed physicist Werner Heisenberg postulated that a phenomenon is dependent upon the position of the observer. Thus, when the observer changes his position, the phenomenon is altered. For instance: On a bright moonlit night, after traveling just a few hundred feet down the road, it seems that the moon has signifi- cantly shifted position in the sky. Clearly, the moon has not actually moved a noticeable distance in such a brief period of time. Nevertheless, we perceive it as having done so. When it comes to chronic stuckness, a shift in the position of one's consciousness from being completely dominated by finite, rational consciousness to being influenced and guided on an ongoing basis by the infinity perspective of the higher, transcendent aspect of the soul serves to alter the phenomena which to this point has kept us bound. The circumstances and stresses of one's life will not instantly go away when working on a soul -level with essential oil blends. POWERFUL SOUL -LEVEL WORK WITH ESSENTIAL OILS \u00a9 Copyright 2008 NAHA All rights reserved 16 What will change is the position from which one's consciousness views these circumstances and stresses. It is this shift in posi- tion from finite to Infinite, from stuckness to possibility, that can enable one to make correct choices, and thus, to move b eyond what previously seemed intractable and hopeless. Spiritual PhytoEssencingTM : Creating Soul -Portraits in Oils More than a decade ago, based upon the theoretical premise set out above, I founded the art of Spiritual PhytoEssencing (SPE). Phytoessences (plant essential oils) contain very active biochemical components, including hormone precursors, which can be utilized by the organism's physical plane. The olfactory nerves: nerves related to the sense of smell are directly connected to cerebral centers, including the hypothalamus: a crucial portion of the brain stem. The hypothalamus plays a pivotal role both in maintaining physiological homeostasis and by serving as the link between the autonomic nervous and endocrine (hormonal) sys- tems. In addition to essential oils providing benefit on a physical level, they also exert a strong influence upon the psycho -spiritua l plane. SPE employs customized essential oil blends to help an individual overcome the separation of the higher self, which lies at the core of emotional - and physical disharmony. SPE is a synthesis of certain aspects of aromatherapy, doctrine of signatures, classical homeopathy, modern physiology, Kab- balah, philosophy, anthroposophical science, Chinese medicine, herbal medicine and folklore, depth psychology, gemstone heal- ing and color therapy. In SPE, an interview (called anamnesis \u2014Latin for recollection ) is conducted which enables the practitioner to identify the consti- tutional themes that characterize the subject's psycho -spiritual dynamics. Various aspects of these themes are then proficiently matched with corresponding essential oils. The resultant custom blend constitutes a plant -soul analogue of a given individual's soul -picture. In other words, it is a soul -portrait in oils. It is this customized correspondence that encourages that individ ual's soul to accept the homogeneous blend of plant -souls as a reorganizing nucleus. In essence, the custom blend serves as the unique matching key that can unlock the moribund potential within an analogous human -soul. During the last ten years I have conducted hundreds of in -depth anamneses and found that a history of failed or dysfunctional romantic partner relationships is nearly universal among people who feel an urgent need to experience life with their whole b eing. Among the most important constitutional themes, which help to clearly differentiate one soul from another, are those revolvin g around romantic love and sexuality. A romantic/sexual -nature is constitutional and immutable and therefore a fundamental com- ponent of an individual's unadorned soul -nature. It is precisely the relatively fixed nature of one's romantic/sexual nature tha t of- ten mires the psyche and intimate relationships in conflict. I have noted that issues relating to romantic love and sexuality are commonly central to long -term patterns of personal and social dysfunction. Often no amount of rationalizing, adapting or counsel- ing resolves these issues. At best, they may inspire an unsatisfying limbo state sustained by ongoing repression of the true self. Following many years of practice, I have reached the conclusion that only through soul -level processing can one come to an un- derstanding and accommodation of his or her romantic and sexual parameters and then effectively communicate the require- ments of this inner reality to others. Harmonizing the currents of the psycho -spiritual plane facilitates an altered state characterized by heightened awareness, recep- tivity, flexibility, objectivity and the illumination of life -choices. True healing can proceed only in this altered state. SPE practice consists of using customized essential oil blends in concert with homeopathic -style potentized dilutions prepared from one drop of that blend. In this way, the human -soul meets on two different quantum energetic levels with the plant -soul com- bination. I never cease to be in awe of the potential these oil blends hold for profound life -change, which my clients consisten tly report to me. In my thirty years as a practitioner of the natural healing arts, after having worked with a wide variety of na tural heal- ing modalities, I know of no other healing substances that could substitute for essential oils in this regard. POWERFUL SOUL -LEVEL WORK WITH ESSENTIAL OILS \u00a9 Copyright 2008 NAHA All rights reserved 17 Imaginative Consciousness: Developing \"Pure Relation\" With Essential Oils Martin Buber's philosophy of dialogue, eloquently elaborated in his book I and Thou, has greatly influenced me in my develop- ment of both the theoretical structure and techniques of the art of Spiritual PhytoEssencing . Buber's central point is that one en- counters spirit only through a meeting of souls at a between space. This I -Thou meeting engenders the development of pure relation characterized by caring and reciprocity. In contrast, the more common and generally superficial I -It experience is ch ar- acterized by one's lack of acknowledgement on a soul -to-soul level, thus using and experiencing rather than knowing and caring. Philosopher J.N. Findlay in The Transcendence of the Cave remarks: \"The other world is, in fact, not so much another world as another half of one world, which two halves only make full, rounded sense when seen in their mutual relevance and interconnection.\" In this regard, Spiritual PhytoEssencing places great emphasis upon the use of \"imaginative consciousness\" which enables one to go beyond analysis of the physical properties of a given essential oil via a complementary perception of the spiritual roo ts from which these physical properties arise. While these spiritual roots are beyond the reach of the senses and rational consciousn ess, they nevertheless are the source of the material nature of an essential oil. In I and Thou, Buber discusses the I -Thou relationship between human - and plant -soul: \"The living wholeness and unity of a tree that denies itself to the eye...of anyone who merely investigates, is manifest to those who say You, is present when they are present: they grant the tree the opportunity to manifest it [living wholeness], and now the tree that has being manifests it.\" For many years I have understood this concept and always apply it to my relationship with the elements of the natural and spi ri- tual worlds. Friedrich Nietzsche in Thus Spoke Zarathustra observes: \"...the greatest events\u00bethose are not our loudest but our stillest hours.\" When I was a young man, I spent a great deal of time traveling about the United States and camping in state and national forests. I can clearly recall hiking through forests on warm, summer afternoons when only the hum and buzz of fl ying insects and the occasional rustle of deciduous leaves in the breeze echoed in the cathedral silence. At those times I was com- pletely aware of a presence that, as Buber states it, \"flashes towards us from that which has being.\" I could tangibly perceive that the trees, wildflowers, ferns, etc. were all ensouled and had being. Accordingly, it is natural for me to \"say (feel and commu- nicate) You\" to essential oils and engage with them in a reciprocal soul -to-soul meeting. Kabbalists place great emphasis on the importance of kavanah, or intent. A practitioner of SPE must say You to the oils or th ey will not reveal their being and the resultant blend will be limited in its potential to meet the client's soul in the \"betwee n space,\" attract spirit and encourage realization. Identifying the Unique Soul -Nature of Each Oil Every living cell must be animated by a vital force, or \"ensouled,\" and it is this incarnation of higher forces into living tissue that lends each organism its tangible expres- sion. Hence, when using essential oils for psycho -spiritual work, all of the physical features, clinical properties and historical associations, etc. of the plant can be used to de- velop an understanding of its spiritual roots. The central reference text in Spiritual PhytoEssencing is Berkowsky's Synthesis Materia Medica/Spiritualis of Es- sential Oils, which contains 105 chapters and each is de- voted to the elaboration of the inner soul -nature of a spe- cific essential oil. This process of elaboration involves the POWERFUL SOUL -LEVEL WORK WITH ESSENTIAL OILS \u00a9 Copyright 2008 NAHA All rights reserved 18 interweaving of information regarding plant characteristics, habitat, historical and folkloric associations and therapeutic a ction with a diverse variety of synchronicities. The great psychologist Carl Jung coined the term \"synchronicity,\" referring to thoughts and events that are connected in othe r ways than causally (i.e., by the law of cause and effect). In the classic example from his own work, Jung, while listening to a pa- tient recount a dream about a scarab (a type of beetle), heard a light tapping on his office window. When he went to investig ate the sound, he saw a brilliantly colored scarab just outside the window. This uncanny coincidence made him wonder about the meaning of such synchronicities. Synchronicities play a major role in my elaboration of the unique soul -nature of each essential oil. In the following discussion , I describe one such synchronicity that enabled me to come to a deep understanding of monarda oil. Monarda/Deer Synchronicity Monarda fistulosa \u2014commonly known as wild bergamot, bee balm or Indian perfume \u2014is a North American species of the Labi- atae (Mint) family. It has a lovely sweet and refined citrusy scent. Monarda's fragrant, solitary, globular flower -clusters that de- velop at the end of branches contain between 20 to 50 two -lipped, tubular flowers that range in color from pale -blue to lilac. E ach flower head rests upon a whorl of showy and pinkish leafy bracts. There is a strong spirit -world synchronicity between monarda and deer. Noted spiritual herbalist Matthew Wood in The Book of Herbal Wisdom writes : \"Remember that remedies that are sweet, full of juiciness, beauty and aroma are deer medicines... Indeed, any plant which helps us to understand and cope with beauty is a deer medicine... [Monarda] grows in the kinds of places deer frequent, in old fields near the edges of woods, where feeding and hiding are hardly a breath away from each other.\" When I first read this, I instantly awakened to the monarda/deer synchronicity. I have been taken with monarda for many years , having been strongly drawn to it thirty -five years ago in my wanderings through the mountains and forests of Maine, New Hamp- shire and Vermont. In those days I carried my wildflower - and tree field guides with me whenever I hiked through the woods, and to this day I can still remember identifying it. Deer blend well with their environment and are very graceful and sensitive to every sound or movement. They are highly intuit ive, seemingly having extrasensory perception. Thus, at times, the thoughts or attention of people with deer medicine will race ah ead, and they seem not to be listening to others. Too, they are often described as being swift and alert. Just as the deer bounds from one place to another, a person with deer medicine often moves quickly from one situation to another. Deer have no ulterior motives or hidden agendas; they do not plot intentionally to harm someone but they fully understand the requisites for survival and the need to seek out alternative paths to a goal. Someone who possesses deer medicine is not thre at- ening and has an air of innocence. Deer medicine elaborates the power of gentleness and sensitivity as well as the ability to heal and to touch the hearts and minds of wounded, withdrawn individuals. The gentleness of the deer is representative of divine c om- passion. Deer medicine helps one to access the gentleness of spirit, which is the essence of the power to heal. It teaches ac cep- tance of others and that love and compassion are the necessary counterbalance for personal power. Deer medicine encourages: connection to the woodland spirits; grace; gentleness in thought, speech and touch; the ability to listen; appreciation for the beauty of balance; power of gratitude and giving; willingness to sacrifice for the higher good. The deer type has purity of purpose and the determination to dispel personal shadows and walk in the light. She knows the work she was born to do and is motivated by spirit and understanding rather than by the need for personal glory, and thus, brings beauty a nd grace to any surrounding. This discussion of deer medicine can serve as virtually a precise description of the monarda -type. Positive qualities such as ge n- tleness in speech or ability to listen, which perhaps are not yet fully elaborated in her outward being, exist in a state of potential and she aspires to actualize them. POWERFUL SOUL -LEVEL WORK WITH ESSENTIAL OILS \u00a9 Copyright 2008 NAHA All rights reserved 19 My wife and I live on six wooded acres that border on hundreds of acres of State forest. From the day I began writing the monarda chapter, visitation by deer to our property was continual. On that day, I looked out through my office window and saw a young buck, no more than twenty -five feet away, resting below a cedar tree and gazing back at me. When my wife and I walked along our trails, we saw fresh deer prints every day. For the remainder of the time that I worked on the monarda chapter, tha t buck and a young doe, his twin sister, made our land their home, spending hours feeding on berries, shrubs and tender grasses and then, invariably, would choose to rest in the shade of the cedar tree directly in front of my office window. When I first spotted the buck outside my office window, he was looking directly at me. We looked into each other's eyes for s ev- eral minutes. I felt and communicated You, and, in turn, his eyes manifested his being. When I finally turned back to my wr iting, I was vibrating from this encounter with spirit and was certain beyond doubt that I truly knew monarda. This understanding of the monarda/deer synchronicity provided crucial information that now enables me to precisely individualize the use of monarda oil in my deep soul -level work with essential oils.

Discussion According to ancient Greek mythology, the story of Mint is closely woven with the mysteries of sexuality and passion. Its contradictory actions are at once strengthening to the Reproductive Qi, contraceptive, and even abor- tifacient. According to ancient French proverbs, girls who drink Mint will fall in love, while bulls that eat Mint will be- come enraged with passion. The Latin name for Mint, Mentha, mentalis or mens , means mind or spirit. Paradoxi- cally, Mint can also signify sexual sublimation and the development of a discriminatory mind capable of granting those who exercise it freedom of choice and the awareness of self. In Greek mythology, the nymph Mintha was the lover of Hades (the Roman Pluto), god of the Underworld and lived with him in his underground kingdom. However, Hades eventually abducted Persephone, the daughter of Zeus (the king of the gods) and Demeter (the goddess of the harvest and fertility). According to the myth, two things occurred after this abduction that help to elucidate the different properties of Mint. The first was that Mintha flew into such a rage that Persephone trod her into the ground with her heel and turned her into Mint. This part of the story signifies the burning passion of Mintha, as well as the anger that comes about, when passion is not transformed. The meaning of this legend is that Peppermint (Mintha) enables one to transform anger in order to more accurately perceive ones place in life. Peppermint both stimulates and soothes the Liver. In Chinese acupuncture, the Liver transforms anger through Perspective (a version of the Liver Spirit) to Compassion (a version of the Liver virtue), thus enabling one to see the bigger picture. In this case, the bigger picture is that Divine Will did not sanction Mintha's personal needs. Af- ter all, Mintha was only a nymph while Persephone was a goddess and not just any old goddess but the daughter of the king of gods himself. Because of its correlation to the Spring, the Liver also relates to ones ability to extend boundaries and has to do with stepping on others or being stepped on by them. Peppermint cools the steam of anger created by the encroachment of others and allows a more cool -headed approach to take root. The legend of Mintha dramaticizes the importance of the Liver Spirit to place the events of ones life into a proper perspective through the ability to visualize and understand how one best fits into a harmonious relationship with others. In fact, this idea clearly describes the virtue of the Liver (Compassion). In Chinese, the word for compassion is (r\u00e9n), depicts two people occupying the same space and time harmoniously, both understanding the needs of the other. Confucius talked about Ren/Compassion at length and considered it to be the most important of the Five Virtues. The second thing that occurred after the abduction in the Mintha/Persephone myth has to do with the contraceptive aspect of Mint. In ancient times, Mint was thought to coagulate the sperm and obstruct generation by killing the fetus. These ideas are symbolized by the reaction of Demeter to the abduction of her daughter Persephone after which she grieved so inconsolably that the earth became barren from her neglect. Later in Athens a fertility festival held exclu- sively for women called the Thesmophoria was held in her honor. These dual aspects of fertility and contraception are further symbolized at a rare temple in the Peloponnese dedicated to Hades at the foot of Mount Minth (MinthaMint) on the edge of a sacred wood consecrated to Demeter. The message symbolized in this juxtaposition is that passion for life will be eternally transmuted to fit the occasion. The relationships through which it manifests may change form in order to accommodate the players involved, but the passion itself will resurrect itself and find a more fitting \u00a9 Copyright 2008 NAHA All rights reserved 23 expression. One of the common names for Mint, Herb of Death, comes from the ancient French countryside where Mint was burned in rooms where the dead were laid. While the more obvious use was possibly to conceal the smell of death, the symbolis m relates more to the passion of the life spirit that will always spring forth again in newer and more vital situations as time goes on. Anger concerning the loss of a loved one would, therefore, be a good use for Peppermint on this level, which could then trans mute base emotion into a higher perspective more suitable for the Good of All. The alternating play between the physical and psycho -emotional, hot and cold, nature of Peppermint is also reflected in the grow th of the plant, especially its flowers. Flowers in general represent the maximum outward expression of the plant before it turns i ts energy inward to form the seed. In this way, the flower embodies the plant's Yang force that generally manifests through heat and co lor. For this reason, the flowers of most plants place themselves at the outermost position of the plant \u2014the top of the stem. In Peppermint, however, the flowering occurs in a series of globe -shaped clusters at the junction of the stem and branches. This juxtaposition gives one the impression that the Peppermint flowers are climbing up the stem as if they were rungs of a ladder and that, rather than manifesting their Yang force in one single explosion at the top of the stem, the Peppermint flowers organiz e this expression into small sequential bursts. This pattern demonstrates the restraining signature of Yin upon Yang, the Cold upon the Heat, and symbolizes the restraining of unmitigated passion \u2014passion that seeks the personal good at the expense of the Good of All. This unique Yin -Yang pattern perfectly represents the spring season, which corresponds to the Liver and the Wood Phase. At this time, the Yin forces must carefully temper the outward Yang expansion of the plant so that it will not expand so rapidly that it will be killed by the next frost. This Yin tempering force places the Yang growth factors of the plant into proper perspective, a perspective that includes not only the immediacy of the daily weather, but the context of the season the daily weather is in. These ideas fit per- fectly with the psycho -spiritual effects of the Liver that Peppermint is able to instill in those who use it \u2014the ability to appl y the big picture to daily life. Combinations Peppermint Blend can be blended with most oils although it tends to dominate ones that are most fragile. Blend Peppermint with Rosemary cineole for debility caused by prolonged allopathic treatments. Blend with Lemon to purify the blood. Blend with Raventsara, Eucalyptus citriadora and Lavendula vera in a carrier oil of St John's Wort for shingles.
