What is an ovarian cyst? Ovaries are the female reproductive organs. They occur on either side of the uterus. They release ovum as well as hormones like oestrogen and progesterone. When a fluid-filled sac develops in any of the ovaries, it is known as an ovarian cyst. Females develop at least one ovarian cyst in their lifetime. Most of them are harmless but some may give rise to complications. The different types of ovarian cyst are: Follicle cyst: When a follicle fails to break open, it can give rise to a cyst. Since follicles are formed in each menstrual cycle, this is the most common type of ovarian cyst. Corpus luteum cyst: It is the type of ovarian cyst that ruptures around the time of menstruation when the follicle sacs fail to dissolve themselves. It may contain blood. Dermoid cyst: It is the cyst that contains hair, fat, and other tissues. Endometriomas: These are the tissues that abnormally grow outside the uterus instead of inside it and get attached to ovaries. Cystadenomas: These develop on the outer surface of the ovaries and are non-cancerous. How does an ovarian cyst occur? During the menstrual cycle, ovaries release follicles. These follicles release eggs as well as female hormones. In most cases, these follicles disintegrate. But when they continue to grow, leading to an accumulation of fluid in it, it causes a cyst. If the cyst is follicular, it may contain blood. In some cases, it contains hair and fat too. In most cases, such cysts are not cancerous. If cysts are in large numbers, it leads to a polycystic condition which can cause infertility. Who is prone to ovarian cyst? An ovarian cyst can occur if you show any of these conditions: - Hormonal problems - Endometriosis - Pregnancy - History of ovarian cysts - Severe pelvic infection What are the symptoms of an ovarian cyst? How is ovarian cyst diagnosed? Ovarian cyst shows the following signs and symptoms: - Sharp or dull pain in the lower abdomen on the side of the cyst - Constant bloating - Feeling of fullness or heaviness in the abdomen - Nausea - Vomiting - Breast tenderness - Pain during sex - Problem in emptying bladder or bowel - Unexpected weight gain - Frequent urination - Unusual vaginal bleeding Diagnosis A doctor primarily does a physical examination of the pelvis to feel for the swelling caused by a cyst. If there are some obvious signs then he/she may suggest you go through ultrasound. Ultrasound helps in gauging the shape, size, mass, and location of the cyst. Also, a pregnancy test will be done to rule out the case of pregnancy. A hormone level test helps them in determining if it is a hormone related issue. Also, in menopausal women, a blood test is suggested. It is uncommon for menopausal women to get an ovarian cyst. Blood test helps in determining if the cyst is cancerous. Complications of ovarian cyst Usually, ovarian cysts are easily treatable. But sometimes they do give rise to complications like: - Rapid breathing - Sudden severe abdominal pain - Weakness, dizziness, and fainting - Pain with fever and vomiting - Turning of normal cysts into cancerous ones. - Infertility Treatment for ovarian cyst Most ovarian cysts go away within three months. If your cyst persists longer, the doctor may suggest you have OTC pain relief medicines. Also, birth control pills prevent ovulation. This prevents the chance of more cysts. But if the cyst is unusual and life-threatening, the doctor may opt for surgical removal of just the cyst or the whole ovary. Usually, they opt for laparoscopy and laparotomy for smaller and larger cysts respectively. Questions answered by trusted doctors Did you know? Who are prone to ovarian cancer ?
