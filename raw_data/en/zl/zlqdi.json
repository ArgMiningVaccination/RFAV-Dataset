There's a growing interest in refashioning the traditional concept of healing the body into healing the whole person \u2014 mind, body, and spirit. The UPMC Center for Integrative Medicine, located at UPMC Shadyside in Pittsburgh, provides services intended to complement \u2014 not replace \u2014 more conventional medical treatments. From age-old therapies, such as acupuncture and naturopathic approaches, to mind-body methods, such as biofeedback and relaxation therapies, our staff work with each patient to determine which services are most appropriate. To receive care at the center, patients are encouraged to obtain a referral from their current physician. The referral process fosters a collaborative approach to care, opening lines of communication between center staff and referring physicians. Patients may request a specific therapy or program or participate in an initial evaluation process. The Center for Integrative Medicine is a member of the [Academic Consortium for Integrative Medicine & Health](http://www.imconsortium.org/), placing it among the top complementary or integrative medicine programs in the nation. Members research the scientific basis of therapeutic approaches that may complement established medical treatments.
