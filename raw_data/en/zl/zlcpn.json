The keto (short for ketogenic) diet is a high-fat, low-carb diet that has helped many lose weight and has also been shown to help some boost their ability to fight against ailments including diabetes, cancer, Alzheimer's, and epilepsy. Here's how it works: When you consume more fat and fewer carbohydrates, your body is able to go into a state called ketosis. Ketosis is a metabolic state where your body turns fat into ketones, which help power your brain, and enable your body to burn fat faster and more efficiently. Fewer carbs in your diet mean that your blood sugar and insulin levels are lower as well, which is healthier all around. With keto, dieters avoid carbs, sugar, fruit, beans and legumes, alcohol, root vegetables, and \"diet foods\" that may be hiding sugar-like chemicals, and instead focus on consuming meat, low-fat vegetables, nuts, butter, cream, eggs, fish, healthy oils, avocado, and small amounts of certain fruits. People who have adopted a keto diet have reported that the increase in protein and decrease in carbs leaves them feeling fuller for longer and more energetic, which makes the keto diet easier to stick to. They also find themselves losing weight quicker without tracking calories, in addition to easing other health concerns. If you want to learn more or you're ready to give the keto diet a shot, here are some audiobooks with information and guidance to help you.
