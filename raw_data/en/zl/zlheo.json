He received post-PhD training in psychiatry at McGill University, as well as post-PhD training in neuroscience at Johns Hopkins University.Dr. Dor\u00e9's research pertains to studying new effective mechanisms that limit neuronal dysfunction associated with ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, Alzheimer disease (AD), aging, and various other neurological disorders. His objective is focused on understanding the protective role of heme metabolites in the brain using cellular/molecular techniques and various models of stroke, Alzheimer disease, and aging. New knowledge is gained specifically by investigating the action and the role of activity of the heme oxygenase enzyme and its unique bioactive metabolites: carbon monoxide, iron, biliverdin, and bilirubin. His overall goal is to slow down the progression of the disease and ultimately stop it.Winning the Chairman Award for Outstanding Service and Dedication at the Department of Anesthesiology, University of Florida, is among his many accomplishments. He is involved in many ad hoc journal peer review activities and sits on the editorial board of multiple journals, including Frontiers in Neuroscience, Neurotoxicity Research, Faculty of 1000, World Journal of Cardiology, International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Translational Neuroscience, and International Journal of Clinical Anesthesiology.Dr. Dor\u00e9 is a well-published author with over 126 scholarly publications across 13 different disciplines.

Dr. Dor\u00e9's research pertains to studying new effective mechanisms that limit neuronal dysfunction associated with ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer disease (AD), aging, and various other neurological disorders. His objective is focused on understanding the protective role of heme metabolites in the brain using cellular/molecular techniques and various models of stroke, Alzheimer disease, and dementia. New knowledge is gained specifically by investigating the action and the role of activity of the heme oxygenase enzyme and its unique bioactive metabolites: carbon monoxide, iron, biliverdin, and bilirubin. He has also conducted pioneered work in the field of pro-inflammatory prostaglandins and the GPRR receptors. His overall goal is to slow down the progression of the disease and ultimately stop it.
