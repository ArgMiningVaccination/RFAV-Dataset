BUILDING BETTER HEAL TH 3PAGE 3What is chemotherapy? Chemotherapy is the use of strong drugs to treat cancer. You will often hear chemotherapy called \"chemo\" (KEY-mo), but it's the same thing. Chemo was first used to treat cancer in the 1950s. The chemo drugs you get have been tested many times. Research shows they work to help kill cancer cells. What does chemo do? There are more than 100 chemo drugs used today. Doctors choose what drugs to give you based on the kind of cancer that is in your body (the stage). Your doctor will talk to you about the goals of chemo before you start your treatment. Chemo may be used to: Keep the cancer from spreading. Make the cancer grow slower. Kill cancer cells that may have spread to other parts of the body. Make side effects from cancer better, like pain or blockages. Cure cancer.ChemotherapyBUILDING BETTER HEAL TH 4What it is, How it HelpsPAGE 4 Will chemo be my only cancer treatment? Sometimes chemo is the only cancer treatment needed. More often, it's part of a treatment plan that can include surgery and radiation therapy. Here's why: Chemo may be used to shrink tumors before surgery or radiation. It may be used after surgery or radiation to help kill any cancer cells that are left. It may be used with other treatments if the cancer comes back. How does chemo work? The body is made up of trillions of cells. Cancer starts when something causes changes in a normal cell. This cancer cell then grows out of control and makes more cancer cells. If cancer isn't treated, it can spread to other places in your body and cause more problems. Chemo kills cells that grow fast, like cancer cells. It can affect normal cells that grow fast too, like the cells that make hair or blood. But most normal cells can fix themselves. You will probably get more than one chemo drug. This is called combination chemotherapy. The drugs work together to kill more cancer cells. What about chemo side effects? Chemo drugs are very strong. They kill any cell that's growing fast, even if it's not a cancer cell. So, some normal, healthy cells that grow quickly can be harmed. This can cause side effects. Ask our cancer care team about what side effects you may expect from the chemo you will get. If you have bad side effects, blood tests may be done to find out if you need a lower dose of chemo, or if you need longer breaks between doses. Keep in mind that even if chemo causes problems, the \"good\" for you will likely outweigh the \"bad\" of the side effects. For most people, side effects go away over time after treatments end. How long it will take is different for each person. Some side effects can take longer to go away than others. Some might not go away at all. If you start to feel upset or sad about how long treatment is taking, or the side effects you have, be sure to talk to your doctor. Our cancer care team can help you with side effects.The Cancer Care Center at Logansport Memorial Hospital 5NEXT: Radiation Therapy Source: American Cancer SocietyPAGE 5What is chemotherapy?

Radiation therapy is the use of strong beams of energy to treat cancer and other problems. There are many types of radiation. One that you may know about is x-rays. If you've ever had an x-ray of your chest or any other body part, you've had some radiation. Radiation is used in much higher doses to treat some cancers. How does radiation therapy work? Special machines send high doses of radiation to cancer cells or tumors. This kills the cancer cells. It keeps them from growing and making more cancer cells. Radiation can also harm normal cells near the tumor. But normal cells can fix themselves - cancer cells can't. Sometimes radiation is the only treatment needed. Other times it's used along with chemotherapy (chemo for short) or surgery. Sometimes radiation can cure cancer. Other times it may be used to slow down the cancer to help you feel better. Be sure to talk with our cancer care team about the goal of your treatment.BUILDING BETTER HEAL TH 6Radiation Therapy What it is, How it HelpsPAGE 6 How is radiation given? Radiation can be given three ways, but the most common form is external beam radiation. Logansport Memorial's Cancer Care Center has a state-of-the-art linear accelerator to deliver this type of radiation for our patients. External beam radiation Radiation that comes from outside your body is called external beam radiation. (External means outside). A big machine called a linear accelerator sends high-energy beams to the tumor and some of the area around the tumor. How long does treatment take? Most people get radiation treatment 5 days a week for 1-10 weeks. The number of treatments you need depends on the size and type of cancer, where the cancer is, how healthy you are, and what other treatments you're getting. Most people get a break on weekends so their normal cells can heal. What happens during treatment? External radiation therapy is like getting an x-ray. There's no pain, and it only takes a few minutes. But it takes time to get the machine set up, so it may take 15-30 minutes to get each treatment. You'll lie on a treatment table, underneath the radiation machine. The radiation therapist may put shields or blocks between the machine and other parts of your body. These protect the rest of your body from the radiation. You may see lights that are lined up with the marks on your skin. Sometimes a mold or mask is used to make sure you are lying the same way each time. You'll need to stay still during the treatment, but you don't have to hold your breath. What about radiation side effects? Some people have no side effects at all, while others do. The most common side effects are: Feeling very tired Skin changes over the treated area Not wanting to eat Other side effects depend on the part of the body being treated. For instance, if you get radiation to your head, you might have hair loss. Or if you get radiation to your chest, you might have a cough or sore throat. Most side effects go away in time. But there are ways to help you feel better. If you have bad side effects, your doctor may stop your treatments for a while, change the timing of your treatments, or change the type of treatment you're getting. Tell our cancer care team about any side effects you have so they can help you with them.The Cancer Care Center at Logansport Memorial Hospital 7NEXT: Things to Remember Source: American Cancer SocietyPAGE 7What is radiation therapy?

These include taking dietary supplements, megadose vitamins and herbal products, massage therapy, magnet therapy, spiritual healing and meditation. Those practices are not generally recognized by the medical community as standard or conventional. CSF (colony stimulating factors): Hormone like substances that regulate the production and function of blood cells, to promote the growth of infection- fighting white blood cells. Combination Chemotherapy: The use of two or more anticancer medications for treatment of an individual cancer patient. CT scan (computerized tomography): Diagnostic x-ray procedure in which a computer is used to generate a three-dimensional image. Culture: A laboratory procedure in which micro- organisms contained in samples of blood, secretions, or other body fluids are cultivated in special nutrients; used to determine the presence and type of infectious agents.

Granulocytes: One type of white blood cell that destroys invading bacteria. Hormone: Substances secreted by various organs that help to control growth, metabolism, and reproduction. Used as treatment following surgery for breast, ovarian or prostate cancer. HL-A (human histocompatibility antigens): These antigens appear on white blood cells as well as cells of almost all other tissues and are analogous to red blood cell antigens (A,B, etc). By typing for HL-A antigens, donors and recipients of white blood cells, platelets, and organs can be \"matched\" to ensure good performance and survival of transfused and transplanted cells.Hematologist: A physician who specializes in the study of blood diseases. Hematology: The study of blood and blood-forming organs. Hemoglobin: The iron-protein component in the red blood cells that carry oxygen to the tissue. Hemorrhage: A general term for loss of blood, often profuse, brought about by injury to the blood vessels or by a deficiency of certain necessary blood elements such as platelets. Hyperalimentation: Intravenous administration of nutrients, bypassing the gastrointestinal tract. It is also called total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Infusion: The process of dripping fluids into the vein through a plastic tube.
