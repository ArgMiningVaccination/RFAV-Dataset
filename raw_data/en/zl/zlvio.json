adult medicine, are not well-established in paediatric research. Rational prescribing tools, criteria lists of potentially irrational prescribing, are used to study the use of medicines and can be used to detect and quantify inappropriate prescribing. This allows researchers to compare quality of prescribing across different populations, identify factors associated with irrational prescribing, and evaluate the effectiveness of interventions to improve prescribing. Aims The aims of this thesis were to identify and appraise all existing tools for studying irrational prescribing for children; to develop a rational prescribing tool that could be used across paediatric practice in the United Kingdom (UK); and to validate the novel tool for application in research and clinical practice in the UK. Methods A systematic review of paediatric rational prescribing tools was undertaken and identified two such tools. One of these, the POPI (Pediatrics: omissions of prescriptions and inappropriate prescriptions) tool, was designed for application to any paediatric practice setting but founded in French clinical practice. The second, PIPc (Indicators of potentially inappropriate prescribing in children) is a tool designed for use in primary care only, in Ireland and the UK. In order to develop criteria applicable to any UK paediatric setting, the POPI tool was modified for use in the UK, resulting in the novel POPI UK tool. Each criterion was compared to relevant UK national guidelines, with three possible outcomes: no change; modification; or omission. Criteria concordant with UK guidelines were integrated into the new tool unchanged, criteria differing from guidelines were modified, and criteria with contradicting guidelines or no relevant UK guidelines were omitted. Two validation studies were designed and carried out to evaluate POPI UK. Firstly, a prospective clinical validation study was designed to review the prescriptions of 600 children in a UK children\u00b7s hospiWal, in inpaWienW and emergenc\\ deparWmenW seWWings. This xiii study evaluated the relevance of the POPI UK criteria to the study population, assessed its ability to detect potentially inappropriate prescribing, and examined factors associated with any potentially inappropriate prescribing detected. Secondly, the precision of the POPI UK tool was tested through an inter- and intra-rater reliability study. Cohen\u00b7s Kappa was calculated for agreement between two raters applying the criteria to twenty anonymised cases. Results The systematic review identified five articles meeting inclusion criteria. These related to three paediatric rational prescribing tools, POPI, PIPc, and POPI UK. The POPI tool comprises 105 criteria and was designed for use in any paediatric practice setting, based on French standards of practice. The PIPc comprises twelve criteria, designed for use in primary care in Ireland and the UK. Due to the PIPc being specifically designed for use in primary care, the POPI tool was the focus of further study. Modification of the POPI criteria was undertaken to develop the POPI UK tool. No change was made to 49 criteria., 29 were modified, four were reduced into two through combination with closely related criteria and 23 were omitted, including the omission of a category. The resulting POPI UK tool comprises 80 criteria divided into 21 clinical categories. In the clinical validation study, the POPI UK criteria were relevant to the majority (96%) of the study population and the tool identified potentially irrational prescribing. In addition, several limitations were identified, including the detailed level of clinical information required to apply the criteria. The inter- and intra-rater repeatability of POPI UK were rated as good, with Kappa values of 0.44 and 0.57 respectively. This was lower than the reliability of the original POPI tool. On examination of the studies, it appeared that methodological differences rather than the modification of the tool explained the observed difference in reliability of the criteria. xiv Conclusions Two existing paediatric rational prescribing tools were identified and appraised, POPI and PIPc. In order to develop a tool applicable to children across UK paediatric settings a novel tool, POPI UK, was developed by modifying the POPI criteria. Validation studies demonstrated that POPI UK was relevant to a majority of the studied population and was able to identify potentially irrational prescribing with good reliability. This tool could be used in UK paediatric practice settings to evaluate rational prescribing. However, a number of significant limitations to all three paediatric rational prescribing tools have been identified and further research avenues are suggested including refinement of the POPI UK criteria. xv Dissemination of research related to thesis Corrick F, Conroy S, Sammons H, Choonara I.

Trent Paediatric Society Meeting; 2016 (Poster) (Appendix 6) Chapter 1: Background and rationale for the thesis 1 1 Background and rationale for the thesis 1.1 Introduction Rational prescribing describes practices aimed at minimising inappropriate prescribing at a systems level or, in other words, considering all elements at all stages of the process involved in prescribing, from the legal framework governing therapeutics to individual prescriber decisions. This includes, for example, the development of essential drug lists or the use of guidelines. This approach to improving the use of medicines is supported by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and was identified as an objective of the WHO Twelfth General Programme of Work 2014-2019 (1). Lack of rational prescribing has both human and economic costs (2). Inappropriate prescriptions may harm individual patients by causing adverse events or in opportunity cost when more effective treatments exist for a disease. They may also incur a health cost to a wider community, for instance where injudicious antibiotic prescribing practice increases the rate of resistant infections or where appropriate vaccination programmes are not implemented at the cost of subsequently higher rates of infection. There are also economic costs in terms of inefficiency of health spending and the financial implications of any detriment to health incurred by poor prescribing practices (3). Children pose some additional challenges to rational prescribing compared with adults (4). Dosing regimens commonly require the prescriber to make calculations based on age or weight (5), therefore increasing the risk of inappropriate prescribing; for less experienced prescribers, this may compound uncertainty about what to prescribe and contribute to omissions. Another impediment to rational use of medicines in children is the relative paucity of high-quality research exploring the use of medicines for children compared to adults. This hinders efforts to implement high-quality evidence-based practice as inadequacy of evidence forces clinical decisions to be made based on consensus or personal clinical experience alone, as is evident in a number of National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines for children and young people (6-8). There are a number of Chapter 1: Background and rationale for the thesis 2 contributing factors to this bias, including complex ethical issues, high cost and difficulty in recruiting participants for paediatric trials (9-11). This is discussed further in section 1.5 Studying prescribing for children (on page 16). 1.2 What is rational prescribing? 1.2.1 Defining rational prescribing Rational prescribing was named an objective of the WHO Twelfth General Programme of Work 2014-2019 (1). The WHO defined rational prescribing in 1985 as \u00b4ZheQ SaWieQWV receive the appropriate medicines, in doses that meet their own individual requirements, for an adequate period of time, and at the lowest cost both to them and the community (12) and continues to use this definition in their on-going work. Other terms sometimes used as synonymous include rational use of medicines, appropriate prescribing and optimal prescribing that is based on reasoned motives but that may still be inappropriate, disWingXishing Whis from \u00b4appropriaWe\u00b5 prescribing as Wheir preferred Werm describe optimal prescribing in line with the above WHO definition. As indicated in the WHO definition, rational prescribing is prescribing that results in the patient receiving medicines that are appropriate to treat them, not only in terms of drug selection but also dosage, duration and use of a lower cost drug in preference to a higher cost equivalent. This means that research into rational prescribing is a broad field that incorporates studies with varied approaches, including research into inappropriate prescribing, administration errors, prescribing trends, adherence to clinical recommendations for treatments, patient concordance, accessibility of essential drugs, and use of generic versus branded drugs(14). These studies are relevant both at the level of individual prescribers or organisations, and at national or international levels. Chapter 1: Background and rationale for the thesis 3 Irrational prescribing can take a number of different forms. In the field of rational prescribing for older adults, inappropriate prescribing has been categorised into three broad groups: misprescribing, overprescribing, and underprescribing (15). Misprescribing includes choice of incorrect medication for a disease, incorrect dosage or duration of therapy, selection of a drug that is otherwise contraindicated in a patient due to a comorbid illness or concurrent drug(s) with which it may interact. Overprescribing is prescription of an unnecessary or insufficiently beneficial medication, and underprescribing is the omission of a medication that would be beneficial. 1.2.2 Barriers to rational prescribing There are many factors that contribute to the prevalence of irrational prescribing. These include issues around education and supervision of prescribers, the prevailing culture of the medical community in terms of reference and adherence to guidelines, and patient beliefs and preferences (16-18). Infrastructure and economic pressures may prevent prescribers and patients from having access to appropriate medicines, or cultural beliefs may act as a barrier to patient use of appropriate medicines even when they are available (19). Prescriber, infrastructure, economic and patient factors have all been described as potential barriers to rational prescribing, with some examples of each shown in Figure 1-1 adapted from Holloway, 2011 (20). Prescriber factorsLack of prescriber knowledgeInadequate continuing educationPrescriber culture (where seniors may set inappropriate examples)Inadequate time for consultations Infrastructure factorsInappropriate and biased pharmaceutical promotionInability to provide adequate observation or follow-up of patientsLack of diagnostic services Economic factorsInadequate supplies of appropriate medicinesPerverse economic incentives driving prescription of more expensive medicines Patient factorsPerceived and actual patient demandCultural beliefs leading to patient non-adherenceUnintentional non-adherence due to lack of education, instructions or inabilities to administer medicationsChapter 1: Background and rationale for the thesis 4 Figure 1-1: Barriers to rational prescribing Any of the categories of prescriber, infrastructure, economic or patient factors can have an impact on children and in several aspects children may be particularly vulnerable to inappropriate prescribing. The vulnerability of children to inappropriate prescribing is in part due to the diversity of the paediatric population, ranging from neonates to adolescents, with concomitant changes in body weight and maturity of metabolic pathways. These challenges affecting rational prescribing for children are examined in Section 1.5.3. Considering examples of patient factors in a paediatric population, adherence to treatment may be hindered by children rejecting medications due to oppositional behaviour, embarrassment in taking medications around peers, difficulty in swallowing tablets, rejection of taste of medications, and other feeding issues (21). In addition, lack of edXcaWion or cXlWXral beliefs of parenWs ma\\ haYe an impacW on a child\u00b7s adherence Wo prescribed medications (22). Prescriber factors affecting paediatric prescribing include the limited space for training on paediatric prescribing in undergraduate curricula (23) and the fact that, while decision-making is more likely to be led by senior clinicians, junior doctors are the most likely to actually complete prescriptions, whether handwritten or electronic (24). In addition, infrastructure and economic factors have led to underrepresentation of children in pharmacological research (25), meaning that drug selection and dosage may rely upon lower quality evidence for children than for adult populations. Electronic prescribing systems designed to reduce prescribing error in adult medicine are not immediately applicable to paediatric practice due to the more varied dosing regimens appropriate to paediatric patients (24). 1.2.3 Harms of irrational prescribing Chapter 1: Background and rationale for the thesis 5 The risks of irrational prescribing are not only to the individual patient in receipt of inappropriate medicines (or lack of access to appropriate medicines), but also to their community in terms of both health costs and economic costs. Overuse and misuse of medicines may cause significant morbidity and mortality. Irrational prescribing may lead directly to adverse drug reactions (ADRs) where contraindicated medications are used; in a meta-analysis of hospital admissions due to ADRs, it was found that one in ten hospital admissions in older patients were due to ADRS and the majority of ADRs were considered to be preventable (26). Polypharmacy has consistently been identified as a factor associated with higher risk of ADRs (27-29). ADRs present a significant burden in terms of of morbidity and healthcare costs. Avoidable ADRs have been estimated to contribute to additional need for hospital stays amounting to 181,626 bed-days in the UK National Health Service (NHS); the cost of the additional hospital stays alone came to \u00a398.5 million per year (30). Other studies have estimated what proportion of admissions were related to prescribing, with a systematic review of such studies finding that 3.7% of preventable hospital admissions were drug-related, one-third of which were due to prescribing problems, one-third due to patient adherence problems, and one-fifth due to monitoring problems (31). Another review similarly found 3.5% of hospital admissions were due to ADRs, and further reported that approximately 10% of inpatients will experience an ADR during their admission(32). All of these health costs translate to high economic costs. For instance, in one study considering all ADR-related admissions to UK hospitals, the total economic impact was estimated to come to \u00a3466m annually in healthcare costs(33). Children are also vulnerable to ADRs. One sWXd\\ in a WerWiar\\ children\u00b7s hospiWal in Whe UK estimated that 2.9% of paediatric emergency admissions were caused by ADRs. A large proportion of these related to treatment of cancer (48%), with adverse effects that are known risks such as thrombocytopaenia and neutropaenia. However, 22% of ADRs were considered avoidable (34). Examples of avoidable ADRs included; diarrhoea and vomiting secondary to antibiotics given for viral illness, and constipation secondary to opioid analgesia occurring without any prescribed prophylaxis. This study suggested that rational prescribing could prevent a number of ADRs that are serious enough to warrant emergency admission. For illustration of the healthcare associated costs of such cases, Chapter 1: Background and rationale for the thesis 6 hospital admission for a child with gastrointestinal illness was estimated to cost \u00a3989 per patient in 2015 (35). Any admission due to an ADR clearly represents harm to the patient in terms of morbidity and economic harm in healthcare-associated costs, but also has wider ramifications. There is also an additional burden of indirect costs, such as lost productivity of affected individuals, travel, expenses, and the wider impact on others in the household (36). Additional costs like this are equally germane to paediatric medicine, where parents may experience loss of earnings and additional childcare costs for other children in the family (37) . The overall figures are therefore likely to be much higher. Antibiotic misuse provides a clear example of community costs of inappropriate prescribing. Antimicrobial resistance carries with it significant risks of morbidity and mortality and continues to increase worldwide (38, 39). Inappropriate use of antibiotics is considered a key contributor to the rise in antimicrobial resistance, demonstrated by the correlation between outpatient antibiotic use and penicillin-resistant pneumococci found in Europe (40). In 2018, antimicrobial resistance was estimated to cost $179,000 per 100,000 population in the UK(41). This equates to \u00a3140,000 at the conversion rate at the time of publication of those figures, or a total of \u00a392.8 million for the whole of the UK. 1.2.4 Interventions to promote rational prescribing The WHO identified twelve core interventions to promote rational use of medicines, shown in Figure 1-2, reproduced from Promoting rational use of medicines: core components, WHO (page 3, (42)). Chapter 1: Background and rationale for the thesis 7 Twelve core interventions to promote more rational use of medicines 1. A mandated multi-disciplinary national body to coordinate medicine use policies 2. Clinical guidelines 3. Essential medicines list based on treatments of choice 4. Drugs and therapeutics committees in districts and hospitals 5. Problem-based pharmacotherapy training in undergraduate curricula 6. Continuing in-service medical education as a licensure requirement 7. Supervision, audit and feedback 8. Independent information on medicines 9. Public education about medicines 10. Avoidance of perverse financial incentives 11. Appropriate and enforced regulation 12. Sufficient government expenditure to ensure availability of medicines and staff Figure 1-2: WHO core interventions for rational use of medicines Many of these interventions, such as interventions eight to twelve, require state-level changes to regulations and practice. Others, like two and four, may be at the level of international or national guidelines, or more localised institution-based guidelines. The focus of this thesis will be around intervention seven, establishing systems of supervision, audit and feedback, and in particular, the focus will be on methods of measuring quality of prescribing that can be used to facilitate such systems. In order to improve practice through these systems, it is essential to have an objective measurement that can be used as a standard against which actual practice is compared. This gives reliability and consistency to feedback and allows prescribers, managers, and researchers to make comparisons between different prescribers, different areas, or at different times. It also, therefore, enables a quantitative assessment of the effect of interventions on the quality of prescribing. Chapter 1: Background and rationale for the thesis 8 1.3 Assessing rational prescribing As discussed in section 1.5, in order to pursue systemic improvements towards more rational prescribing, it is necessary to develop methods of measuring the quality of prescribing to identify targets for interventions and to review the results of such interventions. There are broadly two possible extremes of approach: 1) assessment of prescribing on an individual case-by-case basis taking into account the comprehensive patient and clinical context, with no predetermined definitions for appropriate or inappropriate prescriptions, or 2) using predefined standards to define appropriate and inappropriate prescribing, which can be applied by any rater. Each of these approaches has its advantages and limitations. Chapter 1: Background and rationale for the thesis 9 1.3.1 Case-by-case expert analysis In a case-by-case assessment of rational prescribing, there are no predetermined criteria defining specific medicines that will be considered appropriate or inappropriate for a given condition. Instead, an expert or a panel of experts reviews each prescription and determines its appropriateness in the context of that specific case. For instance, this approach has been used to assess not only prescribed medicines but also the decision not to prescribe, through evaluation of recorded consultations and patient records (43). The assessment may be structured by a number of questions about the prescriptions, for instance a classification system developed by Kunin et al, shown in Figure 1-3, provides a framework for an expert rater to assess antibiotic prescriptions (44). While the classification provides a structure for the assessment, the determination of whether or not a prescription is appropriate is determined by the rater\u00b7s oZn jXdgemenW. Figure 1-3: Kunin framework to evaluate antibiotic prescriptions An advantage of this approach is that the approach can be used in any setting, accommodating differing local guidelines or formularies (45). The assessment of prescriptions by this method can also take into account the context of the individual patient, including co-morbidities, other concurrent treatments, or laboratory test results (46), which may increase the accuracy of the assessment.

It may be more time-consuming than other methods and is likely to require more data about each patient (47), which may necessitate prospective data collection directly from attending clinicians or patient records. This means they cannot be applied to retrospective dispensing databases which are often used in studies into the use of medicines, as data about comorbidities or laboratory test results are unlikely to be available (48). In addition, the individuality of each assessment may increase accuracy at the cost of precision leading to inconsistent results due to subjectivity. This may reduce repeatability and therefore limit the usefulness of comparing results obtained using different experts or combining data in meta-analyses. Methods of assessing the reliability of rational prescribing tools is discussed further in Section 4.1 Evaluating rational prescribing tools. 1.3.2 Rational prescribing assessment tools There are a number of well-established criteria used to study rational prescribing in adult medicine. Their development and use are closely linked to the principles of quality indicators, which are explicit, measurable statements about aspects of healthcare that can be used to assess care (49, 50). Prescribing indicators have been differentiated from rational prescribing criteria by being defined as an assessment of quality of care, where rational prescribing criteria and other review criteria assess the appropriateness of specific decisions (51). It is common for indicators to contain statements that rely on measurements at a population-level, for instance the five World Health Organisation (WHO) prescribing indicators, discussed further below. As in the WHO prescribing indicators, it is common that indicators are in the form of an expected percentage or measured prevalence within the studied population (52, 53). 1.3.3 WHO prescribing indicators The WHO has made rational prescribing and improving medicines policies one of their priorities, and began developing indicators for measuring and monitoring use of medicines at a national level in 1985 (16). The WHO core prescribing indicators were Chapter 1: Background and rationale for the thesis 11 developed through iterative studies in prescribing across a number of countries and are not intended to be comprehensive. Rather, they comprise a simple tool that is standardised, does not need adaptation for use in different nations, and can be used to reliabl\\ assess \u00b4a feZ criWical aspecWs of pharmaceXWical Xse\u00b5 five core prescribing indicators are: 1. Average number of drugs per encounter 2. Percentage of drugs prescribed by generic name 3. Percentage of encounters with an antibiotic prescribed 4. Percentage of encounters with an injection prescribed 5. Percentage of drugs prescribed from essential medicines list or formulary The WHO core prescribing indicators have been used internationally for over twenty years, studying prescribing in a wide range of settings, including public and private institutions, in both primary and secondary healthcare (55-57). Although their use is not explicitly restricted to any particular setting, they were designed and field-tested primarily in developing countries (58) 1.3.4 Rational prescribing criteria In contrast to indicators, rational prescribing criteria, or rational prescribing tool, would be expected to capable of assessing a specific prescription without data about the rest of a study population (51). In other words, unlike an indicator statement based upon prevalence within a population, which can never be applied to an individual prescription, criteria would be expected to enable a rater to determine whether a specific prescription was appropriate according to a predetermined standard. Criteria lists are well-established tools in research in rational prescribing in adult medicine. A number of assessment tools have been developed to permit audit and research of rational prescribing using implicit or explicit criteria to measure prescribing practice in adults. Implicit criteria are patient-specific and take into account all medicines in the paWienW\u00b7s cXrrenW regimen (59). They rely upon the assessor\u00b7s jXdgemenW of appropriateness and may accommodate patient preference, making them vulnerable to subjectivity and bias, and they are time-consuming to apply (15). Explicit criteria are Chapter 1: Background and rationale for the thesis 12 usually founded upon published reviews or consensus opinions, and often provide rigid drug-specific or disease-specific \u00b4rXles\u00b5 of pracWice (59). They are therefore unable to account for individual patient differences and require regular updating, as well as modification for different regions (15). In a systematic review of published rational prescribing criteria, Kaufmann et al identified 46 different assessment tools (60). Of these, 61% were explicit tools, 17% were implicit, and 22% used a mixed approach. 78% of the tools targeted older people, with the remaining tools having no specified targeted group. The study did not identify any tools designed for assessment of prescribing for children. There have been no systematic reviews of published rational prescribing criteria in children. It should be noted that rational prescribing criteria are not clinical guidelines or rulebooks for prescribers, but tools that are used to attempt to identify patterns of potentially irrational prescribing (in the very broad sense of \u00b4raWional prescribing\u00b5 as defined b\\ Whe WHO, see Section 1.2.1) and in some cases to provide a quantifiable measurement of rational prescribing that facilitates comparative and interventional research. An individual prescription may be highlighted as potentially irrational by a criterion, but in fact be wholly appropriate and rational in the specific patient and environmental context it occurred. 1.4 Examples of rational prescribing criteria from adult medicine 1.4.1 Rational prescribing criteria for older adults The use of rational prescribing criteria as tools to study appropriate use of medicines is particularly well-established in older adult medicine, for which at least seven sets of explicit criteria listing potentially irrational prescribing have been published, as detailed in a 2010 systematic review (61). All seven of these criteria lists were developed through a modified Delphi consensus process. This development process is a method whereby consensus is reached by a panel of experts via an iterative activity in which members of the panel rate agreement with Chapter 1: Background and rationale for the thesis 13 statements, and the statements with levels of agreement above pre-defined cut-offs are redistributed to panellists for further consideration. Those that achieve a high level of agreement are ultimately included in the final product, in this case the list of criteria in the rational prescribing tool. The seven rational prescribing tools for older adults identified in the 2010 systematic review are shown in Table 1-A from Chang and Chan, 2010 (61). Table 1-A: Rational prescribing tools for older adult medicine Rational prescribing tool Country of development Number of criteria Beers US 68 Laroche France 34 McLeod Canada 38 NORGEP* Norway 36 Rancourt Canada 111 STOPP/START** Ireland 65 Winit-Watjana Thailand 77 *NORGEP=Norwegian General Practice Criteria **STOPP/START=Screening Tool of Older Person\u00b7s Potentially Inappropriate Prescriptions/Screening Tool to Alert doctors to Right Treatment In order to illustrate the development, scope and application of such tools, one was selected for further discussion. The Beers Criteria are a well-known and extensively studied example of these tools, having been repeatedly modified for use in different countries and to update to current practice(62-66), and are further described below. 1.4.1.1 Beers Criteria The Beers Criteria were originally developed by Delphi consensus in 1991 specifically for application to nursing home residents (63) and have since been modified several times, to extend application to older adults in the community (62) and to update criteria over time (64, 65). They have been utilised both in prevalence studies assessing rates of irrational prescribing and also in outcome studies examining relationships between potentially inappropriate prescribing and health outcomes. They were most recently updated into the American Geriatrics Society (AGS) 2012 Beers Criteria (64). The criteria list potentially Chapter 1: Background and rationale for the thesis 14 inappropriate medications for adults aged 65 years and older, categorised into three groups: medications to avoid in all older adults, medications considered potentially inappropriate in older adults with certain diseases or syndromes, and medications that should be used with caution. The AGS 2012 Beers Criteria comprise fifty-three medications or medication classes. For example, fourteen fall within the category of medications considered potentially inappropriate in older adults with certain diseases or syndromes. The Beers Criteria have been used in a diverse range of studies. One systematic review found 18 studies evaluating patient outcomes related to Beers Criteria, undertaken in community and healthcare settings (67). This review supported the clinical accuracy of the criteria in terms of a relationship between potentially inappropriate medicines and poorer patient outcomes. It showed that inappropriate prescribing (as detected by the Beers Criteria) was associated with hospitalisation of older adults who were studied in community settings, and with adverse drug reactions and increased healthcare costs in healthcare settings. The Beers Criteria have also been used to study rational prescribing in primary care settings (68) and due to their design, are applicable to retrospective datasets such as those accessible via prescribing and administrative databases (69). The success of the Beers Criteria in achieving wide use and demonstrated usefulness has been credited to their explicit nature, simplicity for application by non-pharmacist researchers or auditors, and broad dissemination (66). 1.4.2 Validation of rational prescribing criteria There are a number of approaches to validating rational prescribing tools. Any measurement can be considered in terms of accuracy and reliability, where accuracy represents how closely a measurement fits with a true value and reliability represents how close repeated measurements will be to one another. This is discussed further in Chapter 5. When trying to assess the accuracy of a rational prescribing tool, the literal accuracy would be the correlation between a derived score with the true rate of irrational Chapter 1: Background and rationale for the thesis 15 prescribing. In the absence of a means to estimate the true rate, this might be calculated through comparison between different tools. Alternatively, rather than calculate the accuracy of the tool as a measure of prescribing, tools could be evaluated by assessing correlation between clinical outcomes with scores (15). Although this less closely represents the accuracy of the tool, high levels of correlation demonstrate the clinical usefulness of the tool. This validation approach is very useful for showing clinical impact of the inappropriate prescribing that has been identified but is time-consuming and technical to conduct. Only seven of the 46 adult tools discussed by Kaufmann et al had documented clinical validation studies assessing correlation between scores and clinical outcomes (60). A common and less complex approach to validating tools is evaluating their ability to identify irrational prescriptions in practice, without then attempting to test correlation with clinical outcomes. This methodology tests whether tools are able to identify any potentially irrational prescribing, although it does not measure the sensitivity or specificity of Whe Wool as Where is no comparison Wo \u00b4WrXe\u00b5 YalXes. This approach has been used widely, for instance to evaluate the START criteria (70). This can be taken further by applying two tools to the same data, such that rates of identified irrational prescribing detected can be compared between the two different tools. In order to assess the reliability of a tool, repeatability studies should be conducted. For instance, there are two published repeatability studies assessing the STOPP/START criteria, one evaluating inter-rater reliability when scored by pharmacists (71) and one evaluating inter-rater reliability when scored by physicians (72). These studies calculated the degree of agreement between different raters when looking at the same patient data (in each case, raters scored twenty anonymised patient records according to the STOPP/START criteria) and found good levels of agreement, suggesting that studies using the STOPP/START criteria that are conducted in different institutions or regions can be validly compared. Chapter 1: Background and rationale for the thesis 16 1.5 Studying prescribing for children 1.5.1 Children are under-represented in clinical research Children are frequently excluded from clinical trials altogether, leaving adult data to be generalised to a paediatric population(9, 73). There is a recognised bias in health research priorities towards adult research. Studies of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in children are essential and have been historically neglected; more recent work has increased understanding of pharmacokinetics in the paediatric population, but paediatric pharmacodynamics remain less well understood (76). There are a number of challenges in studying pharmacodynamics in children; for example, the development of validated outcome measures is complicated by the need to accommodate a range of developmental stages (25). An illustration of this difficulty is the well-established use of exercise tolerance in the form of a timed walking distance, which is clearly not applicable to neonates and has a normal range that changes with age. Extrapolating data from adult studies, or so-called piggy-backing of a paediatric group onto a trial designed to evaluate drug safety and efficacy in adults can result in inadequate evaluation of the dose-response relationship across the range of the paediatric population (10). Using randomised controlled trials (RCTs) as an example, there are almost five times as many RCTs with exclusively adult participants compared with RCTs with exclusively child participants in data up to 2004 (74) and ongoing challenges despite ongoing efforts to increase the inclusion of paediatric populations (25). In studies that include both adult and child participants, data is often presented without separation by age groups and without subgroup analysis for children. This often limits conclusions for both safety and efficacy in this age group(75). Even when children are included in research, it is often not the whole childhood population of neonates through to adolescence (10). Trials are needed in all ages due to the changing physiology during growth and development. For example, the pharmacokinetics of some therapies, such as paracetamol, vary significantly between neonates, children, and adults (76) and dose calculation needs to take into account maturation of enzymes involved in metabolism and clearance. Likewise, biological markers that may be used to measure therapeutic response vary with age, for instance urea and creatinine are high in newborns and decline with maturation, later rising again in Chapter 1: Background and rationale for the thesis 17 older age(77). Such age-related differences mean studies that incorporate only a partial range of ages or fail to report data by age may obscure clinically significant results for particular age groups. The relative paucity of high-quality research involving children is especially acute in the field of pharmacology, as even where drugs are likely to be of significant relevance to paediatrics- such as those for treating Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and diabetes mellitus- they are often not licensed for use in children (78). Studies have shown that at least a quarter, and up to 90%, of all children treated in hospitals across Europe receive unlicensed and off-label drugs (79). Efforts to address this include the European Union (EU) regulations passed in 2006, which made it mandatory to evaluate all new medicines, or new indications for existing medicines, for potential paediatric use and sought to incentivise paediatric drug development research (80). The 10 year report to the European Commission showed that while there had been improvement, including authorisation of over 260 new medicines between 2007-2016 and over 131 completed paediatric investigation plans by the end of 2016, there remained substantial issues with important areas, such as paediatric oncology, remaining vulnerable to continued neglect compared to adult oncology research (81, 82). This is in spite of valuable progress that has been made in paediatric oncology, which has benefitted greatly from increased research activity in recent years and is a subject of paediatric study that has high rates of success in recruitment (10). There are other areas where the relative absence of paediatric evidence has resulted in potentially significant harm and certainly controversy, for example the treatment of adolescent depression and reported increased risk of suicidality (74). In addition to child and adolescent mental health, paediatric neurology and neonatology have been highlighted as disadvantaged by neglect compared to adult medicine (73). 1.5.2 Perceived barriers to research involving children A number of possible explanations have been proposed for the under-representation of children in research, including economic, practical, and ethical issues (9, 83). Chapter 1: Background and rationale for the thesis 18 The phenomenon may in part be attributable to funding biases driven by governments and independent funding organisations towards greater funding opportunities in adult research (9). The disparity in funding is influenced by marketing considerations including the higher potential profitability of products and burden of disease in the adult population. Serious illness is rarer in children than adults, meaning that there are often smaller pools of potential participants available to trials targeting specific diseases in children compared with adults. Likewise, if an effective treatment is developed, there is ultimately a smaller market for the use of that treatment, which has led to children being described as \u00b4WherapeXWic orphans\u00b5 since Whe phrase Zas coined in Whe 1960s (84). There are movements to counter this bias, with some governments and international agreements providing specific financial incentives for pharmaceutical companies to include children in their research (80, 83, 85). Support is also distributed through research networks (86) and child-focussed independent groups, including charities, providing alternative funding\u00b3my own research having been supported by the Derbyshire Children\u00b7s Research FXnd. In practical terms, research that involves children may be more challenging to design and undertake because of the need to accommodate the range of cognitive and emotional development of child participants, and design outcome measures that are meaningful and measureable across different ages (87). There is also a perception that ethical issues surrounding paediatric research are more challenging than in adult research(88). Most guidelines internationally require researchers Wo gain boWh parenWal consenW and, Whe child\u00b7s assent(73). This supports the principle asserted in Article 12 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child that every child has a right for his or her views to be heard (89). The Nuffield Council on Bioethics 2015 report on children and clinical research proposed Whree paradigms, or e[ample cases, of children\u00b7s capaciW\\ ZiWh respecW Wo decision-making in research (90): Chapter 1: Background and rationale for the thesis 19 1. Some children and young people are not able (at a given time) to give their view on their participation in clinical research. This example includes all babies and very young children, and some older children at certain times, for example if very unwell or unconscious. 2. Some children and young people are not able (at a given time) to make independent decisions about their participation in clinical research but are able to form and express views, to varying degrees of sophistication. 3. Some children and young people potentially have the ability, in terms of both intellectual understanding and emotional maturity, to make their own decisions about participation in clinical research while still being considered minors in some legal capacity. The report highlighted that many children will progress from the first through the second to the third of these paradigms with time and development, while some children may never progress past the first or second case, for instance due to developmental delay. Indeed, the progression is not necessarily always towards more capacity, as illness or injury may mean that a child moves from being more able to less able to make or express decisions. The authors emphasised that assessment of a child\u00b7s abiliWies in relaWion Wo Whese paradigms should not be made on the basis of a diagnostic or age label but according to Whe indiYidXal child\u00b7s deYelopmenW specific Wime of decision-making. In order to gain informed assent, it is therefore necessary to develop information resources that are accessible to children of varying ages, literacy levels, and cognitive abiliW\\. There are a nXmber of sWraWegies WhaW can be Xsed Wo increase parWicipanWs\u00b7 engagement with written material, and it is important to consider parental literacy as well as Whe child\u00b7s deYelopmenWal sWage and liWerac\\. SWraWegies include improving the readability of educational materials by ensuring that they use simple language, are short, clearly organised, and illustrated. Other strategies are the provision of concurrent verbal information with the written information. These methods have been shown to improve understanding, although they do not entirely mitigate the effects of low literacy(91). Wider involvement of parents, young people and children in study design is strongly encouraged as part of a general move to increasing public engagement in research; this Chapter 1: Background and rationale for the thesis 20 has the dual aim of ensuring ethical and responsible research by empowering lay participants and improving the quality of research by optimising study design (92). For younger children or those with developmental delay such that they do not progress past the first or second paradigms highlighted in the Nuffield Council on Bioethics report, it is not possible to gain meaningful assent, yet research in neonates and other children is still crucial to ensuring high-quality and evidence-based treatments are available for them. Neonates present unique challenges, for instance their low blood volumes mean that they are vulnerable to anaemia due to blood sampling, limiting the volume of permissible research-related blood sampling (83). A \u00b4besW inWeresWs\u00b5 approach alloZs e[perimenWal WreaWmenWs ZiWh reasonable probabiliW\\ of benefit to participants to proceed in the same way as any clinical therapy for the child, but in the case of neutral or non-beneficial research (for instance, where a child is included as a healthy control), there are some schools of philosophy that would deem all such research completely impermissible. This is reflected in European law, where research is only permitted when direct benefit is expected for the child (81, 82). This necessitates a close consideration of the balance between risk and benefit, as well as considering the balance beWZeen risk and benefiW in Whe conWe[W of a child\u00b7s aYailable alWernaWiYes (83). In these areas, others argue that collective benefit, altruism, and compensation to the parents or child are morally relevant and influence the acceptability of non-beneficial (but non-harmful) research (93). However, it should perhaps be argued that similar challenges exist in adult medicine, where a common level of education and literacy cannot be assumed across a broad field of potential participants, and clinical outcomes may need to be set in the context of paWienWs\u00b7 baseline activities of daily living. This would seem particular pertinent in older adult medicine, and it is relevant to note that adults aged over 65 are also relatively under-represented in clinical research(94-96). In the case of literacy, the design and accessibility of information involved in consent is extremely important in adult medicine as well as paediatrics, given that more than a quarter of adults in the UK have low literacy or numeracy skills, meaning that they Chapter 1: Background and rationale for the thesis 21 \u00b4sWrXggle ZiWh basic qXanWiWaWiYe reasoning or haYe difficXlW\\ ZiWh simple ZriWWen informaWion\u00b5 (97). Equally, when considering the developmental stage of a child in terms of the paradigms presented by the Nuffield Council on Bioethics report, it must be recognised that such challenges are faced in many areas of adult research including research involving patients with cognitive impairment or dementia(98, 99), who may lack capacity to consent, and research into emergency and trauma medicine where patients may have altered levels of consciousness affecting their ability to consent(100). As in paediatric research, in these areas it is usual that consent by proxy is sought. In the case of paediatric participants this is usually from parents or guardians, but it remains important to consider the parWicipanW\u00b7s views and interests throughout. In summary, the ethical challenges present in paediatric medicine exist across the spectrum of adult research too, but are possibly more visible, in part due to the appropriate high level of attention that is paid to issues around capacity and consent. There certainly is a challenge, however, in carrying out research with meaningful application across the wide range of paediatric medicine, from neonates to adolescents. 1.5.3 Rational Prescribing for Children Rational prescribing for children faces the challenge of a frequently limited evidence base to guide clinical decision-making and has been described as an \u00b4eYidence based deserW\u00b5 (page 1465 (101)). Due to the under-representation of children in research, discussed in Section 1.5.1 (page 16), it could be argued that rational prescribing for children is more challenging due to there being less available evidence to guide decision-making and the necessary use of medicines for unlicensed off-label indications in children (78). In addition, children present additional challenges to high-quality prescribing, for example the need to account for growth and maturation, affect not only bodyweight and weight to surface area ratios but also drug absorption, maturation of metabolic pathways, and drug distribution (5). Chapter 1: Background and rationale for the thesis 22 There is no published review of rational prescribing tools for children. However, there are a number of areas of prescribing for children that have been widely studied and are known to be vulnerable to inappropriate prescribing. Examples of misprescribing, overprescribing and underprescribing have been demonstrated. Misprescribing is a broad area of irrational prescribing that includes inappropriate dosing, drug interactions, and clinical indication (15). This is an area where children may be particularly vulnerable due to the need for age- and weight-based dosing calculations, which are an added opportunity for inappropriate prescribing as compared to adult medicines with a standard dose (4). A study of antiretroviral therapy for children with HIV found that up to 62% of the time, children were prescribed inadequate doses (less than 90% of the recommended dose) (102). The study identified three key factors leading to misprescribing. The first was incorrect dose guidance at initial licensing, inconsistent dosing due to guidelines given dose by both weight and surface area, and inadequate or delayed adjustment of doses for ongoing growth. This highlights the particular challenges of chronic disease management in children, where ongoing metabolic maturation and growth necessitate regular dose adjustments (5). A 2019 statement from the European Academy of Paediatrics identified a number of concerning areas where overtreatment is thought to be common practice across Europe, including the use of proton-pump inhibitors for gastro-oesophageal reflux (GORD) in infants (103). While these drugs are sometimes indicated to manage GORD that causes distress and may have an impact on feeding and growth, they are often prescribed with little evidence of true GORD on the basis of common feeding problems like vomiting or crying (104). This is an area where overtreatment has clear potential for harm as long-term use of acid-suppressing medications for GORD in infants is associated with a number of adverse effects, including nosocomial infections, vitamin B12 deficiency, hypomagnesaemia, and bone fragility (105). Pain management has been an area of historical undertreatment of children, to the extent that it was previously believed neonates did not feel pain and were routinely operated on and managed in intensive care with little or no sedation (106). There continues to be evidence of undertreatment of pain in children due to a number of factors, including clinician fear of adverse effects, difficulty in assessing pain in younger age groups, Chapter 1: Background and rationale for the thesis 23 underdosing, and time constraints in emergency care exacerbated by the difficulty in securing patient compliance (107-109). Despite the evidence of significant irrational prescribing in paediatrics, the use of rational prescribing tools to study the phenomenon is not yet widespread as it is in adult medicine. A systematic review of adult rational prescribing assessment tools was conducted in 2014 (60), this is discussed further in Chapter 2. Prior to my work there had been no such review of rational prescribing tools for children. 1.6 Summary Rational prescribing is an area of research with the potential to have significant economic, social, and health impact. Irrational prescribing costs institutions and systems in unnecessary or needlessly expensive drugs, and in the cost of care for any subsequent morbidity that results from suboptimal treatment of patients or direct adverse reactions to superfluous medications. Patients and communities benefit from high-quality prescribing and it is essential to be able to identify good prescribing in order to recognise targets for improvement, to study interventions, and to compare systems, institutions, or regions. The use of medicines in children has historically been under-researched and consequently paediatric pharmacology suffers from a paucity of strong evidence to support practices, with many and sometimes (such as in neonates) the majority of medications being used in an unlicensed or off-label manner. This illustrates the importance of further work examining the use of medicines in children to facilitate improvement. Chapter 1: Background and rationale for the thesis 24 1.7 Rationale for the thesis This thesis is presented in six chapters, including this introductory chapter. 1.7.1 Aims of the thesis The aim of the thesis was to identify any existing rational prescribing tools for studying irrational prescribing for children; to appraise existing tools; in the absence of an existing tool, to develop rational prescribing criteria that could be used across paediatric practice in the UK; and to validate the novel tool in the study of rational prescribing for children. 1.7.2 Objectives and outline The objectives of the thesis are to: Chapter 2 1. Conduct a systematic review of databases of medical, allied healthcare and pharmaceutical research to identify existing paediatric rational prescribing tools. 2. Analyse the characteristics of existing paediatric rational prescribing tools including the methodology of development, breadth of clinical application, and validity. Chapter 3 1. Modify an identified paediatric rational prescribing tool designed for use outside the UK to enable its application to UK paediatric practice. Chapter 4 1. Validate the new tool in UK paediatric practice in order to assess its usefulness to identify irrational prescribing. 2. Evaluate the patterns of irrational prescribing identified by the new tool. Chapter 5 1. Assess the repeatability of the new tool in an inter-rater and intra-rater reliability study. Chapter 1: Background and rationale for the thesis 25 Figure 1-4 below presents an overview of how each chapter achieved the objectives of the thesis. Chapter 2 The systematic review of rational prescribing tools for children identifies two extant tools for assessing rational prescribing for children. Two tools, POPI and PIPc, are discussed in detail in terms of their development, characteristics, and any existing research using the tools. Chapter 3 The chapter on modifying the POPI criteria discusses the original POPI tool and describes the methods and results of identifying and applying modifications that were necessary to utilise the tool in a UK setting. The resulting POPI UK tool is presented. Chapter 4 A study was conducted to clinically evaluate the POPI UK criteria, in order to assess its usefulness in a clinical setting. The methodology and results of this evaluation of the POPI UK tool are presented. Chapter 5 A further study to test the precision of the POPI UK criteria was conducted. The methodology and results of inter- and intra-rater testing of the POPI UK criteria are presented and are put in context with comparison to other rational prescribing tools. Chapter 6 The conclusions of the above research are summarised and discussed. The three paediatric rational prescribing tools described in the work are compared. The impact of the work is considered and future directions for further research are identified. Figure 1-4: Overview of thesis Chapter 2: Systematic review of paediatric rational prescribing tools 26 2 Systematic review of paediatric rational prescribing tools 2.1 Introduction The use of criteria lists as tools to quantify rational prescribing in adult medicine has been discussed in chapter one. As described in chapter one, there are a number of potential benefits to rational prescribing tools. By enabling quantification of the quality of prescribing, assessment tools facilitate research into interventions aiming to improve prescribing by allowing before and after measurements of quality. Furthermore, explicit criteria enable objective measurement of prescribing, which allows research to reliably compare prescribing in different settings, between different institutions, nationally and internationally. This facilitates deeper research into root causes of problematic prescribing, or excellent prescribing, and fosters collaboration between different groups (64). As discussed in Chapter 1, KaXfmann eW al\u00b7s 2014 s\\sWemaWic reYieZ of rational prescribing tools for adults identified 46 published tools (60). Of these, 22% did not have a stated targeted population, while 78% were specifically targeted to prescribing for older adults. One possible reason for the high number of tools targeted to older adults is that some authors have identified them as being particularly vulnerable to irrational prescribing due to a variety of factors, including frequent existence of co-morbidities, polypharmacy, care taking place in a number of different settings, and the effect of ageing on the selection of appropriate medications (15, 110). Many similar challenges exist in paediatric medicine, with well-recognised developmental changes in physiology and metabolism having significant impact on pharmacokinetics in children of different ages (5) In addition, children may be prescribed medications in a number of different settings, including general practice, undifferentiated emergency departments, walk-in centres, paediatric wards in district general hospitals, and specialist paediatric hospital settings. This means Chapter 2: Systematic review of paediatric rational prescribing tools 27 that prescribers with varied levels of paediatric experience and expertise may be responsible for prescribing. Kaufmann et al explicitly excluded tools targeted to children in their 2014 review (60). The objective of this systematic review of paediatric rational prescribing tools was to produce a comprehensive overview of current tools available to measure rational prescribing in children. It also sought to characterise the tools in terms of methodology of development, content and scope (in terms of included drug or disease groups), and aspects of rational prescribing measured. The systematic review reported in this chapter has been peer-reviewed and published (111), see Appendix 1. This systematic review was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42016049402. 2.2 Aims The primary outcome of the systematic review was to identify all published paediatric rational prescribing tools. The secondary outcome was to identify the types of rational prescribing and drugs or drug groups included in these tools. The population of children was defined as aged less than or equal to 18 years. 2.3 Methods The systematic review was designed in accordance with the PRISMA checklist (112), only excluding irrelevant items. Excluded items were those specific to reviews of interventional research (risk of bias assessment in items 12, 15, 19 and 22) and to statistical analysis in meta-analyses (13, 16 and 21). The completed PRISMA checklist with page numbers given for this thesis is shown in Chapter 2: Systematic review of paediatric rational prescribing tools 28 Table 2-A.

Eligible tools were those targeted at prescribing for children aged less than or equal to 18 years. Tools targeted at prescribing for adults or without a specified target patient group were not eligible. Indicators that did not identify individual prescriptions as rational or irrational but relied upon population datasets to suggest appropriate levels of prescribing (e.g. as percentages) were also not eligible. An age range of 0-18 was selected as the most inclusive definition; 0-16 or 0-17 years are alternative definitions which have been used in some texts but not others, and these therefore risks inappropriately excluding some relevant tools. Chapter 2: Systematic review of paediatric rational prescribing tools 31 Inclusion criteria were: articles describing tools targeted at evaluating the rationality or appropriateness of prescriptions for children aged less than or equal to 18 years, updated and revised versions of previously published tools, and including tools limited to specific drugs, drug groups, diseases or disease groups. Exclusion criteria were: tools targeting adults, tools without specified target patient groups, indicators that assess rates or percentages of prescription types in a population, articles describing a validation study of a previously published tool, educational interventions aimed at improving prescribing, and guidelines describing recommended prescribing. 2.3.2 Search strategy The search was conducted in four databases in order to attempt to capture relevant medical, allied healthcare and pharmaceutical research. These were: Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE), Embase, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (IPA) and the Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL). Databases were searched on 23rd February 2016 from their earliest records possible, i.e. until 2016 week 8. The same search strategy was subsequently used to update the review on 29th July 2019 until 2019 week 31. 2.3.2.1 Search terms Search terms to capture studies including children were derived from the recommended search strategy described by Kastner et al 2006 (113), as these have demonstrated high sensitivity. The MeSH Werm \u00b4inappropriaWe prescribing\u00b5 Zas inWrodXced in raWional prescribing were derived from the systematic review of adult rational prescribing tools by Kaufmann et al 2014 (60), as this review had very similar aims to my own search (for adult rather than paediatric tools). Therefore the combined terms were: Chapter 2: Systematic review of paediatric rational prescribing tools 32 (inappropriate prescribing or suboptimal prescribing or inappropriate medication or inappropriate practices or drug prescriptions or Medication Appropriateness Index) and (child* or children* or p*ediatric* or infant* or adolescent*). The terms were applied to each database, results collated and duplicates removed prior to screening. 2.3.3 Study selection All potentially relevant publications were screened by the author by title and abstract and articles that met the exclusion criteria were excluded. The remaining articles were retrieved in full. Full-texts were examined by the author and a research nurse (JA) who performed independent full-text screening, independently assessing articles according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. In the updated search in 2019, the full-text sceening was completed by the author and a doctor (TM). After this process, any articles without consensus were resolved by discussion and mutual agreement. 2.3.4 Data collection The following proforma was designed to record data from included articles. Aspects of inappropriate prescribing were divided, as has previously been described, into misprescribing, underprescribing, and overprescribing, with further categories of misprescribing adapted from the results of Kaufmann et al 2014 (60). This is shown in Figure 2-1.

One hundred and seventy-two duplicated articles were removed, 1,290 articles were screened by title and abstract and 1,143 were excluded. Four full-texts were unavailable online, from University library resources, and from the British Library. Both reviewers then reviewed 143 full-texts and 140 were excluded. In terms of reasons for exclusion of the 140 excluded full-texts, 110 did not describe rational prescribing tools, 21 did not relate to children, 8 were not related to rational prescribing, and one reported a validation study of a previously published tool. In the case of the four full-texts that were unavailable the abstracts suggested that these articles would not meet inclusion criteria, although this could not be determined with certainty. Three articles met the inclusion criteria. Bibliography mining of the included articles did not produce any further relevant articles. This is depicted in the flowchart in Figure 2-2.

The updated search identified 680 potentially relevant new publications since the search in 2016. Sixty-two duplicated articles were removed. Of the 618 articles screened by title and abstract, 593 were excluded, 25 full-texts were reviewed by both reviewers and 23 were excluded. Two articles met the inclusion criteria.

PLoS Med 6(7): e1000097. doi:10.1371/journal.pmed1000097 2.4.3 Rational prescribing tools identified In total, five relevant articles were identified, relating to three paediatric rational prescribing tools: POPI, PIPc and POPI UK. These are shown below in Table 2-B. Table 2-B: Included articles describing paediatric rational prescribing tools.

(117) PIPc 2016 English Ireland and UK Developing paediatric rational prescribing criteria. (118) POPI UK 2017 English UK Chapter 2: Systematic review of paediatric rational prescribing tools 37 The initial systematic search identified three relevant articles, all relating to a single tool: POPI (English: Pediatrics: Omissions of Prescriptions and p\u00e9diatrie: omissions et prescriptions inappropri\u00e9es) tool (114-116). All three included articles are very similar, two in French and one in English, and describe the process of developing the POPI tool. All three articles have the same first author, S. Prot-Labarthe, with various other authors contributing to each. The earliest, from 2011, is a letter describing the tool. This does not detail all the criteria, only giving nine examples. The 2014 and 2016 articles are English and French language respectively and both report the consensus validation of the tool and give full details of the criteria. For the purposes of clarity, from this point onwards reference to the POPI criteria is specifically to the wording and numbering in the English 2014 publication unless otherwise stated. The differences between the versions are described in Section 2.5.4 (page 55). Two additional relevant articles were identified in the 2019 updated search, each relating to separate tools. One of these was a publication related to the novel tool developed within this thesis, describing the POPI UK tool as discussed in Chapter 3 (118). As this publication was a product of this thesis, it is not further analysed within this chapter but can be viewed in full in Appendix 2. The other article related to the development of a rational prescribing tool for evaluation of paediatric prescribing in primary care, indicators of potentially inappropriate prescribing in children (PIPc) (117). This was developed in Ireland and the UK and was published in September 2016. 2.4.4 Characteristics of POPI The POPI tool comprises 105 criteria (80 PIMs and 25 PIOs) categorised by the authors according to broadly grouped clinical conditions: diverse illnesses, digestive problems, ENT-pulmonary problems; dermatological problems; and neuropsychiatric disorders. The groups are further subdivided into particular symptoms or conditions. The criteria Chapter 2: Systematic review of paediatric rational prescribing tools 38 cover a range of aspects of inappropriate prescribing, including overprescribing, underprescribing, and almost all areas of misprescribing of guidelines and all experts in the panel were French. The POPI tool is not specifically limited to use in any particular clinical setting. The propositions were selected from paediatric health problems in the general population and as causes for hospitalisation, suggesting the tool would be relevant to both primary and secondary care. However, no primary care specialists or general practitioners were involved in the development of the tool. The paediatric population targeted by the tool as a whole is not defined by the authors but some propositions are age-specific, for instance pharmacological treatment for attention deficit disorder is described as inappropriate \u00b4before age 6 (before school)\u00b5 (page 7, (115)) and topical 0.1% tacrolimus is for aWopic ec]ema \u00b4before 16 \\ears of age\u00b5 (page 6, (115)). The criteria of the POPI tool cover a wide range of types of irrational prescribing, including all three categories of underprescribing, overprescribing, and misprescribing. Underprescribing is specifically identified in the tool as omissions. The inappropriate prescription propositions include some examples of overprescribing and misprescribing. Further examples of types of irrational prescribing are listed in Figure 2-4.

Chapter 2: Systematic review of paediatric rational prescribing tools 40 Seven statements describe PIMs with potential overprescribing or misprescribing practices, five statements relate to PIOs. PIPc is designed specifically for use in primary care in Ireland and the UK. By contrast to POPI, the PIPc is by design a tool that is simpler to apply and that requires minimal clinical information about a patient. The only clinical diagnosis specified in the tool is a presumed diagnosis of asthma in two criteria. In the absence of clinical information, this diagnosis is presumed on the basis of the prescriptions described, e.g., \u00b4An inhaled shorW-acting \u00df2 agonist should be prescribed to children under 5 years who are also Waking a leXkoWriene recepWor anWagonisW for describe and name the tool, however the statements all meet the definition of rational prescribing criteria as discussed in Section 1.4.1 (page 12). The authors use the terms interchangeably: \u00b4prescribing criWeria (indicaWors)\u00b5 (page 1, (117)). In this thesis the terms are used distinctly to facilitate greater nuance in some areas of discussion. The PIPc is a tool that has been designed specifically for application in a primary care setting. Unlike the POPI tool, it was developed with the intention of being applicable without access to clinical information, meaning that it can be used to evaluate data from large previously collected prescribing databases where clinical information is often either omitted or concealed. The authors of the PIPc defined their paediatric population as children less than 16 years of age. The age at which young people transition from paediatric to adult healthcare services can vary depending on health needs, social circumstances such as attendance in full-time education, and availability of specialist services (119). In addition, to the specified population for the tool, some criteria further specify particular age ranges, for example, \u00b4Loperamide shoXld noW be prescribed Wo children Xnder 4 \\ears\u00b5 (page 8, (117)); this particular criterion fits with the licensing restriction of loperamide as recorded in the BNFc (120). As shown in Figure 2-5, the PIPc criteria describe almost as broad a range of types of potentially irrational prescribing as POPI despite having far fewer criteria. An example Chapter 2: Systematic review of paediatric rational prescribing tools 41 criterion for each aspect of irrational prescribing described in the PIPc criteria is shown below in Table 2-C. Table 2-C: Aspects of irrational prescribing included in PIPc Aspect of rational prescribing Related inappropriate prescription or inappropriate omission of prescription proposition from PIPc (theme) Drug choice Tetracyclines should not be prescribed to children under 12 years (Dermatological) Drug-disease interactions An inhaled short-acting \u00df2 agonist should be prescribed to all children who are prescribed two or more inhaled corticosteroids for presumed asthma (Respiratory) Drug-drug interactions Domperidone should not be prescribed concomitantly with erythromycin (Gastrointestinal) Overprescribing Sedating antihistamines should not be prescribed to children under 2 years (Neurological) Underprescribing Children under 12 years who are prescribed a pressurised metered-dose inhaler should also be prescribed a spacer device at least every 12 months (Respiratory) 2.4.6 Development of POPI The methodology used to develop the POPI tool was designed to closely match the development of STOPP/START criteria, according to the authors (page 7, (115). As discussed in Section 1.4.1 (page 12), the STOPP/START criteria were developed in Ireland as a rational prescribing tool for use in older adult medicine (121) comprising two lisWs; Whe \u00b4STOPP\u00b5 The\\ Zere designed Wo XpdaWe the widely used Beers Criteria (62), as it listed a number of medications not in use in Europe and at the time had a number of out-dated criteria. In the STOPP/START tool, the authors chose to structure their criteria according to physiological systems in order to mirror the usual organisation of drug formularies. The propositions of STOPP/START were finalised via an eighteen-member panel two-round Delphi consensus where agreement was determined according to the Kappa () statistic for agreement and participants were able to suggest additional criteria if desired (122). The propositions of Chapter 2: Systematic review of paediatric rational prescribing tools 42 POPI were determined by a similar sixteen-member panel two-round Delphi consensus approach. The authors aimed to structure POPI around approximately 100 propositions classified according to biological system and divided into PIOs and PIMs. The number of proposiWions Zas chosen as \u00b4a good compromise beWZeen Whe nXmber of major biological systems to explore, the number of items in the geriatric lists and the maximum number of iWems compaWible ZiWh a Wool eas\\ Xse\u00b5 (page 2, (115)). The authors then compiled a list of health problems that are frequently encountered in paediatric practice, according to frequency in the general population (source not specified), prevalence (derived from data from the French National Insurance Fund for Employers for long term conditions), and frequency as cause for hospitalisation (per French hospital medico-administrative records). The authors identified health problems from this list, referred to as themes, that would either require drug intervention or where pharmacological intervention would be considered inappropriate. For each selected theme, the authors then conducted a literature search (unpublished) to identify recommendations on management. There was a requirement for recommendations to be evidence-based, but the authors did not specify the level of evidence. Only recommendations published after 2000 were accepted, and these were then weighted by date of publication. Accepted sources of recommendations were the French Health Products Safety Agency (Agence Fran\u00e7aise de S\u00e9curit\u00e9 Sanitaire des Produits de Sant\u00e9), the French National Authority for Health (Haute Autorit\u00e9 de Sant\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise), the French Society for Paediatricians (Soci\u00e9t\u00e8 Fran\u00e7aise de P\u00e9diatrie), the American Academy of Pediatrics (National Guideline Clearing House), and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Evidence Cochrane Library. They also used the MEDLINE database to search for examples of medication error and inappropriate prescription (search strategy unpublished). The selection of French versus international guidelines was not explored fXrWher in Whe reporW describing POPI\u00b7s deYelopmenW. Subsequently, the propositions were then validated by a two-round Delphi consensus. Sixteen experts, including pharmacists and paediatricians, were included, of which ten responded to both rounds of the Delphi consensus. The process of recruitment of Chapter 2: Systematic review of paediatric rational prescribing tools 43 experts is not explicitly stated, only that most pharmacists were members of the French Society of Clinical Pharmacy and most paediatricians were members of the French Society of Pediatricians. Propositions were rated by panellists on a nine-point Likert scale for agreement; additionally the panellist experts were invited to make free text comments and to suggest dosage, frequency or duration of therapies if they could provide evidence-based sources to support the suggestions. Propositions with a median score in the upper tertile (i.e. 7-9 points) with agreement above 65% were retained, modified according to comments, then sent out in the second round. Propositions with a median score in the upper tertile with agreement above 75% were then retained. 2.4.7 Development of PIPc PIPc was also developed by a two round Delphi consensus method. Initial propositions were selected via a systematic literature search for previously developed indicators for paediatric prescribing with the criteria as shown in Table 2-D, adapted from Barry et al, 2016 (117). Table 2-D: Inclusion and exclusion criteria of indicators selected for PIPc Inclusion criteria describe hazardous or ineffective prescribing describe prescribing outwith best practice or current guidelines apply to children < 16 years Exclusion criteria medications unavailable in the study setting criteria that require clinical information criteria containing rarely used medications A steering group from Ireland and Northern Ireland, comprising academic and clinical general practitioners (GPs), academic and clinical pharmacists, a pharmacoepidemiologist/statistician, and a postdoctoral researcher, assessed each indicator. Indicators that were not felt to meet the above criteria were excluded. In some cases, indicators were modified to meet the need for criteria that could be applied without access to clinical information, for example when evaluating data from a dispensing database. Chapter 2: Systematic review of paediatric rational prescribing tools 44 The panel for the Delphi consensus was recruited by email invitation, which was sent to 30 specialists identified by the project steering group as experts in their field. Of those invited, eighteen accepted the invitation, nine from the Republic of Ireland (three GPs, three paediatricians, and three pharmacists) and nine from the UK (three GPs, three paediatricians, and three pharmacists). Web-based questionnaires were sent to panel members containing proposed indicators, rationale for their inclusion, and relevant evidence such as national or international guidelines. Panellists indicated level of agreement with the inclusion of indicators on a five-point Likert scale and items with consensus among the panel were accepted. Items without consensus were reviewed and either rejected or revised and presented in the second questionnaire. After the second round, any criteria without consensus were rejected. The literature search identified 47 potential criteria, of which 31 were removed by the steering group after assessment against the inclusion and exclusion criteria listed in Table 2-D. Sixteen indicators were presented in the first round of the Delphi process and nine items had consensus for inclusion, with seven being reviewed. Two of the seven were rejected on the basis of comments from the Delphi panel and five were amended and presented in the second round. Three of these reached consensus while two were again rejected. This resulted in twelve criteria being ultimately accepted into the final PIPc. Reasons for rejected criteria included the need for clinical information, for example in determining the appropriateness of use of very potent corticosteroids. Other criteria were rejected due to panellists commenting that on rare occasions, the described prescribing would be appropriate, for example systemic corticosteroids in children aged 5-15 years Zas rejecWed ZiWh commenWs sXch as, \u00b4Agree unless there is a clinical indication such as flare of jXYeQile UheXmaWRid aUWhUiWiV\u00b5. The twelve accepted criteria came within four clinical categories: respiratory system (six criteria), gastrointestinal system (two criteria), dermatological system (two criteria), and neurological system (two criteria). Chapter 2: Systematic review of paediatric rational prescribing tools 45 2.5 Discussion This systematic literature review identified two paediatric rational prescribing tools, the PIPc and the POPI tool. 2.5.1 Comparison of rational prescribing tools The PIPc is designed for use in primary care settings, while the POPI tool is developed for application in a range of settings and has already been tested in emergency department and community pharmacy paediatric practice (123). This breadth of settings where POPI can be applied is similar to the range of settings in which rational prescribing tools for older adults are used, which include residential or nursing homes (Sloane (124)), hospitals (Oborne\u00b7s (125)), and primary care (NORGEP (126)). Both paediatric tools identified cover a range of types of rational prescribing, the POPI tool covering a particularly broad range. By comparison, the majority of adult rational prescribing tools identified by Kaufmann et al (60) had a narrower focus. Kaufmann et al described twelve categories of irrational prescribing, listed below. x Drug choice x Dosage x Duration of therapy x Duplication x Drug-drug interaction x Drug-disease interactions x Drug-food interactions x Overprescribing x Underprescribing x Cost effectiveness x Non-adherence x Alternative therapies Chapter 2: Systematic review of paediatric rational prescribing tools 46 Of the 46 adult tools identified by Kaufmann et al, the median number of categories of rational prescribing covered by each tool was 4.5, similar to the PIPc, which covers five aspects. However, four tools did cover eight or nine categories of prescribing, comparable to POPI, which covers eight. Of the adult tools evaluated by Kaufmann et al, the majority of tools (28) were explicit, a minority (eight) were implicit, and the remaining 10 used a mixed approach. As described, PIPc was developed as an explicit tool while POPI has both implicit and explicit criteria. There are advantages to each as discussed in Chapter 1. Implicit criteria may be more accurate, as they can take into account individual patient requirements, but this may come at the cost of reliabiliW\\ as Whe\\ are more dependenW on Whe raWer\u00b7s knoZledge and judgement (15). The reverse is true of explicit tools, which are less reliant on rater judgement and therefore might be expected to have greater repeatability and reliability and be less time-consuming to apply, with concomitant lower accuracy. Mixed tools therefore may stand to inherit both the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. Defining impliciW criWeria as Whose Zhich reqXire informaWion aboXW a paWienW\u00b7s oWher medications or medical history, and explicit criteria as those which only require basic demographic information and the indication for a given prescription, both POPI and PIPc are shown to be mixed implicit and explicit criteria lists. These definitions can be illustrated from PIPc; an example of an implicit criterion is: \u00b4An inhaled short-acting B2 agonist should be prescribed to all children who are prescribed WZo or more corWicosWeroids for presXmed asWhma\u00b5. An example of an explicit criterion is: \u00b4Loperamide shoXld noW be prescribed Wo children Xnder 4 \\ears\u00b5. POPI comprises 65% implicit and 35% explicit criteria, while PIPc comprises 50% of each type, as shown in Table 2-E. Table 2-E: Number of implicit and explicit criteria in POPI and PIPc Tool Implicit criteria Explicit criteria POPI 68 (65%) 37 (35%) PIPc 6 (50%) 6 (50%) Chapter 2: Systematic review of paediatric rational prescribing tools 47 In terms of structure and complexity the POPI tool comprises a relatively high number of criteria compared with many tools, although there is one published tool targeted at older adults with 392 quality indicators (not all of which relate to rational prescribing), Assessing Care of Vulnerable Adults 3 (ACOVE-3) (127). The PIPc has closer to the lowest number of criteria of the adult tools. Some of the tools detailed in the Kaufmann systematic review have as few as ten criteria, for instance the Medication Appropriateness Index (MAI) (128), also targeted at older adults. A simple count of criteria is not necessarily a useful measure of complexity, however. For example, in the case of the MAI, it is intended that all ten criteria are applied to each drug in turn, where some systems simply list medications that are contraindicated or essential. As a result of the higher number of criteria, POPI covers a wider range of clinical conditions that are not contained within PIPc. PIPc covers four systems: respiratory, gastrointestinal, dermatological, and neurological. POPI has four category groups, each with subsidiary categories for a total of 22 categories: diverse illness (pain and fever; ; urinary infections; vitamin supplements and antibiotic problems (nausea, vomiting, or gastroesophageal (ADHD). The PIPc is likely to be quicker to apply and does not require the high level of clinical information required by POPI. However, it is also narrower in scope and therefore will not identify some aspects of irrational prescribing such as duplication, inappropriate drug duration, or incorrect drug dosage. As there are fewer clinical conditions included within the PIPc as compared with POPI, this may not reduce its efficacy as a screening tool in general settings but might reduce its usefulness in more specialist settings. There are several areas of clinical practice not covered by either paediatric rational prescribing tool, for instance renal medicine, cardiology, hepatology, and endocrinology. The characteristics of the identified tools (excluding the POPI UK tool, see Chapter 3) are summarised in Figure 2-5. Chapter 2: Systematic review of paediatric rational prescribing tools 48 Rational prescribing tool Healthcare setting Patient group Number Aspects of inappropriate prescribing Misprescribing Overprescribing Underprescribing Drug-food interaction POPI (114-116) Not specified Children 105 PIPc (117) Primary care Children <16 years 12 Figure 2-5: Characteristics of the two identified paediatric rational prescribing tools Comparison of of POPI One clinical validation study of POPI has been disseminated at a conference (129) and more recently published (123). This took the approach described in Section 1.4.2 (page 14) of testing whether POPI identifies any potentially inappropriate prescribing practice in clinical settings. The authors evaluated the ability of POPI to retrospectively detect PIMs and PIOs in an emergency department and community pharmacy. The reported rates of inappropriate prescriptions differ slightly between the reports. Unless stated otherwise, figures discussed will be from the more comprehensive latter publication. A total of 23,342 prescriptions for 18,198 patients were assessed using the POPI criteria. The number of prescriptions differed significantly between settings, with 18,562 prescriptions for 15,973 patients in the emergency department group and 4,780 prescriptions for 2,225 patients in the community setting. In this report, the authors state POPI comprises 101 criteria and that only 82 applicable to patients in hospital were Chapter 2: Systematic review of paediatric rational prescribing tools 49 applied to the emergency department setting, while only 28 that did not require an assessment of diagnosis were applied in the community pharmacy. They furthermore state that among five criteria related to analgesia and antipyrexics, only three were eYalXaWed 6, (123)). The discrepancy in the number of criteria and selective approach to using the criteria is discussed further in Section 2.5.3 (page 50). Rates of PIMs and PIOs per prescription in the emergency department setting were 2.9% and 2.3% respectively, but 12.3% and 6.1% in the community pharmacy setting. When assessed as the proportion of patients affected, rates of PIMs and PIOs in the emergency department were 3.3% and 2.7% respectively, and 26.4% and 11.2% in the community pharmacy. The very high rate of PIMs in the community pharmacy is ascribed by the authors to the availability of medications that they report were not available in the hospital setting, such as cough suppressants. Logistic regression was used to analyse risk factors associated with irrational prescribing as detected by POPI and in the earlier brief report the authors described that prescriptions in the community pharmacy setting and age between 2 and 6 years were both significantly associated with higher risk (129). The age range at increased risk was broadened to 0-12 years in the later report (123). The uncertain significance of the age-based risk finding is discussed in Section 2.5.4 (page 55). As discussed in 2.3.7 Characteristics of the POPI tool, clinical information is required to rate a number of the criteria. Such criteria were excluded from the analysis of the community data. Since both datasets were evaluated used different criteria, the comparability of the identified rates of PIMs and PIOs is compromised. The POPI tool was developed using French, American and UK guidelines but has only been validated to a limited degree, with the above study showing that it is able to detect some potentially irrational prescribing in French settings. It is not known whether it detects irrational prescribing that correlates to adverse events or patient outcomes, or whether it could be used to evaluate prescribing outside French practice. Chapter 2: Systematic review of paediatric rational prescribing tools 50 There is also a published reliability study of the POPI tool (130). Twenty cases were selected from the dataset used for the clinical validation study and assessed by two raters familiar with the tool. Their assessment was used as a gold standard against which eleven oWher raWers\u00b7 findings Zere compared. The POPI tool was reported to have inter-rater reliability of 0.8 (for PIMs) and 0.71 (for PIOs). As the publication is only available abstract from conference proceedings, full details are not available. In particular, it is not made clear whether only the limited selection of POPI criteria applied in the clinical validation study were again used in the inter-rater study, which would mean the entire tool had not been tested. Accepting these limitations, the study demonstrated good repeatability despite the high complexity and mixed implicit and explicit approach of the tool. This is discussed further in Chapter 5. 2.5.2.2 Validation studies of PIPc Although not published as a clinical validation study, the group who developed PIPc have published one study using the criteria to detect potentially irrational prescribing (131). In this study, the criteria were applied using a cross-sectional methodology to a national pharmacy claims database in Ireland, the Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS). The database records pharmacy claims for medicines for eligible patients prescribed by general practitioners or transcribed from hospital prescriptions by general practitioners, with limited patient demographic data (age, gender and region). No clinical details of the patient are recorded. The study included 414,856 children aged <16 years. The prevalence of PIMs and PIOs was reported as 3.5% and 2.5% respectively. These rates are quite comparable to those observed in the POPI study, excluding the outlying high rate of PIMs in the POPI community setting. However, the rate of PIO using all PIPc criteria was in fact 11.5% when including all criteria, as the above rates excluded one of the reported PIPc indicators. The excluded criterion was a PIO related to a spacer device (omission of a spacer device being prescribed at least annually to children prescribed a pMDI aged <12 years). This PIO had a prevalence of 70% among eligible children. The second most prevalent PIO (failure to prescribe emollient to children who were prescribed greater than two topical Chapter 2: Systematic review of paediatric rational prescribing tools 51 corticosteroids) will also have heavily influenced the overall rates of reported PIOs, with a prevalence of 54% among eligible children. In their discussion of the high prevalence of PIO relating to a spacer device, the authors acknowledged that as spacer devices can be bought over-the-counter, this omission is difficult to interpret, although they did note that the devices would be much cheaper to parents if prescribed than if bought without prescription (page 5, (131)). The rate of emollient omission was not further discussed, but this criterion is equally affected by the availability of a wide variety of emollients without prescription. Similarly, a single criterion had a large impact on PIMs and when this criterion, relating to carbocisteine, was discounted the PIM rate fell to 0.29%. The authors discussed the impact of the criterion relating to carbocisteine further. The full criterion, not listed in the clinical study but from the original publication about the development of PIPc, is \u00b4CarbocisWeine shoXld noW be prescribed Wo children\u00b5 (page 8, (117)). This was the most prevalent PIM identified in the study. The authors noted that two Cochrane reviews how found little evidence for the efficacy of mucolytics for respiratory tract infections although carbocisteine is licensed in children aged more than 2 years. In this study, there was a significantly higher risk of PIOs in males compared to females, with no gender difference observed for PIMs (page 4, (117)). This remained the case even when the above dominating criteria (carbocisteine and spacer devices) were discounted. The specific PIOs and potential reasons for this difference are not further discussed in the study. There is no published repeatability study of PIPc. 2.5.3 Limitations of POPI In the reported development process of POPI, initially 108 propositions were presented to the experts. There is inconsistency between the published reports as to how many propositions were ultimately accepted into the final list. The 2014 English language report states 104 criteria were validated, whereas the 2016 French language paper states 101 criteria were validated (115, 116). Furthermore, while it is stated in the 2014 paper that Chapter 2: Systematic review of paediatric rational prescribing tools 52 104 propositions were validated, two removed, and 102 ultimately included, in fact 105 propositions are included in the published list. In the clinical application study published in 2019, the criteria list used comprised the 101 criteria from the 2016 publication (123). The differences between the two papers includes three cases of combining two statements into a single criterion in the 2016 (French) publication. Specifically, two propositions about desmopressin for nocturnal enuresis are combined into one and six propositions about atopic eczema are combined into four. One proposition about benzyl benzoate for scabies is omitted from the 2016 list entirely. The combined propositions are listed in Figure 2-6. Other than this, the described process and criteria are the same. Two propositions, which related to codeine and permethrin, were removed following the consensus study due to new contraindications having been published for the use of these drugs in children, therefore it is stated that 102 propositions were ultimately validated. However, as described above, the final list of POPI criteria contained 105 propositions. In the 2016 French language publication also describing the consensus validation of the POPI tool(116), the authors state that 101 of 108 criteria were validated. For the purposes of evaluation and discussion below, the English language published list of 105 validated propositions in the 2014 report is used. Propositions combined into a single criterion in the 2016 publication of POPI Desmopressin administered by a nasal spray. Desmopressin in the case of daytime propionate 0.05% Dermoval, betamethasone face, the armpits or groin, and the backside of babies or young children. More than one application per day of a dermocorticoid except in cases of severe lichenification. Topically applied 0.03% tacrolimus before 2 years of age. Topically applied 0.1% tacrolimus before 16 years of age Figure 2-6: Propositions combined into one criterion in 2016 publication compared to 2014 publication Chapter 2: Systematic review of paediatric rational prescribing tools 53 Rating the POPI criWeria Wo all of a paWienW\u00b7s prescripWions; becaXse Whe Wool rates omissions as well as inappropriate prescriptions, it cannot be used in whole to evaluate a single prescription for a child. Equally, it could not be used in application to anonymised retrospective prescribing data such as pharmacy reimbursement records, as such datasets do not generally show all prescriptions an individual has received, meaning that omissions could not be scored. The authors of POPI stated that the tool comprises explicit (evidence/opinion based) criteria; however, a number entire medication regimen, characteristics which are usually considered components of implicit (patient-specific) criteria. For example, within the clinical category of cough a sWaWed omission is: \u00b4FailXre Wo propose Zhooping coXgh boosWer Yaccine for adults who are likely to become parents in Whe coming monWhs or \\ears\u00ab\u00b5 (page 5, (114)). Several propositions require the rater to make subjective judgements, including the criterion \u00b4Pharmacological WreaWmenW before age 6\u00ab e[cepW in seYere cases\u00b5 (page 7, (114)) in the category of attention deficit disorder and \u00b4The Xse of W\\pe H2 antihistamines for long periods of WreaWmenW\u00b5 (page 4, (114)) in the category of nausea, vomiting, or gastroesophageal reflux. In each case, \u00b4seYere\u00b5 and \u00b4long periods\u00b5 are noW specifically defined. Furthermore, prescribing information alone is insufficient to rate prescribing using the POPI tool as detailed clinical information is required, beyond even the coding of an indication for a prescription. For instance, in the category ENT infections, one of the inappropriaWe prescripWion criWeria e[cepW in Whe case of hearing loss or if OME lasWs for more Whan Whree monWhs\u00b5. Clearly, in order to evaluate a prescription against this criterion, clinical information about the patient would be required.

In addition, the criterion on whooping cough vaccination relates to perinatal healthcare for a mother rather than directly to paediatric prescribing; the decision to include this criterion in POPI, which is expressly designed as a paediatric rational prescribing too is not discussed by the author. Several of the POPI criteria also require a high degree of clinical knowledge and a subjective judgement to be taken by the rater. For example, in the category bronchiolitis in infants, an inappropriate prescription criterion is the prescription of antibioWics \u00b4in Whe absence feYer, eWc.)\u00b5. B\\ noW providing a prescriptive list of signs of bacterial infection, the tool requires a rater to have the clinical knowledge to determine whether any unlisted signs of bacterial infection were present in the patient. The high number of propositions and the mixed implicit and explicit approach of the POPI tool makes it quite high in complexity. There are criteria requiring a high level of clinical information to apply, for example one criterion in the atopic eczema category sWaWes of seYere lichenificaWion\u00b5 as an inappropriaWe prescripWion. This criterion requires the rater therefore to assess the severity of lichenification of eczema, which would require detailed clinical information to determine. On the other hand, in one criterion, the absence of subjectivity or detail reduces the accuracy of the criterion, which states that prescribing anything other than paracetamol first-line for pain (except migraine) is potentially inappropriate. This criterion would therefore rate opiates for severe pain as inappropriate if they are given before paracetamol. Although explicit criteria by definition lack the nuance to apply to all circumstances at all times, this criterion would flag a common (appropriate) practice, i.e. appropriate early analgesia for severe pain, as irrational. Chapter 2: Systematic review of paediatric rational prescribing tools 55 Some patients may fall within multiple themes, for instance pain and fever might be expected alongside a number of other themes with infectious focuses, such as urinary infections and ENT infections, and other themes describe long-term conditions that any child might have as a co-morbidity. The theme of vitamin supplements and antibiotic prophylaxis includes a proposition describing minimum vitamin D intake, which would need to be assessed for every child. This would therefore require a high level of familiarity with the tool for accurate use and necessitates access to a high level of information about each patient. The clinical application study of POPI highlighted a number of these issues. Only 82 of the criteria were applied to the hospital population studied, and just 28 to the community pharmacy population. While this is a pragmatic solution to the applying the criteria to limited datasets (such as the absence of clinical data about one group), this significantly impairs the ability to make meaningful comparisons between studied groups. The list of criteria used in each case were not included, therefore comparison between even the included criteria is not possible. In addition, only three out of five criteria applying to analgesics and antipyrexics were applied, due to the \u00b4oYerZhelming\u00b5 (page 6, (123)) frequency of this indication. Similarly, in greaW qXanWiW\\\u00b5 (page 7, (123)). For this criterion, a randomly selected 100 prescriptions were assessed from the hospital. It is not stated whether all or a selection of prescriptions for amoxicillin were analysed in the community group, but the rate of inappropriate prescribing for this criterion is reported as 97% out of 13.2% of patients. In the clinical application study of POPI, the authors identified a higher rate of irrational prescribing in children aged between 2 and 6 years (129) or 0 to 12 years in the later report (123). However, given a number of age-specific propositions for children under 6 years of age, this may rather represent the population for whom the POPI criteria are most sensitive rather than the population most at risk of any types of irrational prescribing. By having a varying number of criteria that are applicable to age groups, this Chapter 2: Systematic review of paediatric rational prescribing tools 56 may reduce the usefulness of POPI for accurately identifying variance in irrational prescribing between children of different ages, if such variance exists. 2.5.4 Limitations of PIPc The authors of PIPc stated that the tool comprises explicit (evidence/opinion based) criteria; however, a number of criteria contain patient-specific considerations. Although the criteria of PIPc were designed for application without access to clinical information, two require assumption of the clinical indication, specifically for presumed asthma. The aXWhors sWaWe in Whe deYelopmenW of corWicosWeroids\u00b5 Xsed as a pro[\\ Whe diagnosis of asWhma. The phrase \u00b4for presXmed asWhma\u00b5 (page 8 (117) used in the report of the development of the PIPc tool is absent from the listed criteria in the clinical application study (131). Using such a proxy for a diagnostic category enables the criteria to be used on anonymised prescribing data alone so long as all prescriptions are linked to patients, for instance through allocated participant numbers to facilitate reviewing prescriptions in the context of the prescribing history. However, there are other possible diagnoses such as viral-induced wheeze in children under 2 years, where there is evidence supporting the episodic use of inhaled corticosteroids (132) but not for \u00df2-agonists (133). Therefore, using prescription data without information about the indication for the prescription may redXce should be prescribed to all children who are prescribed two or more inhaled corticosteroids for presumed asthma\u00b5 (page 8 (117). Whe criWeria WhaW 12 \\ears\u00b5. However, doxycycline is the recommended first-line treatment for Lyme disease in children aged 9 to 12 years according to NICE guidance (134). This guidance recognises that use of tetracyclines in children under twelve years is contraindicated and does not have market authorisation, but that this use is accepted specialist practice. The authors of PIPc reported that indications considered appropriate under specialist use were removed from the proposed list of criteria (page 7, (117)). Lyme Chapter 2: Systematic review of paediatric rational prescribing tools 57 disease is endemic in the UK,but with much higher prevalence in Scotland than England, Wales or Northern Ireland, as demonstrated in a 2019 cohort study (135). The study showed incidence was low in Northern Ireland with an incidence per 100,000 population of 6.3 and highest in Scotland at 37.3 per 100,000 (37). The study did not report on Ireland, but the Irish Health Protection Surveillance Centre reported in 2019 an estimated 200 cases of Lyme disease per year in Ireland (136), giving an approximate incidence of 3 per 100,000. As all members of the PIPc steering group were affiliated with institutions in Ireland and Northern Ireland, it is possible that low incidence of Lyme disease in their clinical practice due to the low prevalence in Northern Ireland and Ireland may have led to the decision to include the tetracycline criterion. The regions of practice of the Delphi consensus experts were not listed beyond Ireland and the UK. This issue may be a limitation in the applicability of PIPc to practice across the whole of the UK, particularly in Scotland. Issues such as this are a limitation of the Delphi consensus process acknowledged by the authors of PIPc in their published reporW of iWs deYelopmenW; \u00b4Whe information gathered using a Delphi method represents the views of chosen experts about a specific practice at a given time and this may vary depending on the experts inYolYed\u00b5 (page 7, (117)). Like POPI, PIPc has several criteria that identify a specific target age group. As already discussed, this may make it more challenging to use PIPc to evaluate whether there are differences in rational prescribing due to different age groups in studied populations. Another significant limitation of PIPc identified in its clinical application study was that it highlighted the difficulty in applying even the intentionally simple and explicit criteria of PIPc to retrospective anonymised data (131). The age of patients in the PCRS database was recorded in age bands of 0-4 years, 5-11 years, and 12-15 years. In several cases, these bands overlapped age limits described in PIPc criteria. In order to analyse the data, the authors made calculations to estimate the number of children of a certain age. For example, to calculate the number of children under 2 years in the 0-4 years band, the total number of children in the band was divided by five and multiplied by two. This assumes a normal distribution of ages, which may not be the case. Chapter 2: Systematic review of paediatric rational prescribing tools 58 2.6 Conclusion There are two published rational prescribing tools for use in paediatrics, the PIPc and the POPI tool. Both rational prescribing tools comprise a number of explicit criteria defining potentially inappropriate medicines (PIMs) and potentially inappropriate omissions (PIOs). POPI also contains some criteria with implicit features. The POPI tool was the only paediatric rational prescribing tool in publication at the date of my initial work undertaken in this thesis. As the PIPc is focused on primary care settings, the development of this tool in the UK did not fill the gap in availability of rational prescribing tools that can be applied across the broad range of paediatric practice settings. For both of these reasons, the POPI tool is the focus of the work of this thesis. Prior to utilisation in the UK, comparison of the propositions to UK formularies and clinical guidelines was needed to establish the appropriateness of the criteria for assessing UK practice. Repeatability studies were also considered useful in order to evaluate whether subjective implicit criteria were similarly scored by independent raters. Greater repeatability would increase the usefulness of a tool for comparison between different institutions or regions, where different raters may use the tool. Therefore, modification of the POPI tool for applicability to UK practice followed by both clinical validation of the POPI tool in UK practice settings and reliability studies of the modified tool were identified as valuable avenues of further research. Chapter 3: Developing the POPI UK criteria 59 3 Developing the POPI UK criteria 3.1 Introduction 3.1.1 The POPI tool in context As described in Chapter 2, the POPI tool is one of two published paediatric rational prescribing tools. Unlike the PIPc, which is developed for application to primary care, the POPI tool is designed for use in any paediatric clinical setting. The tool comprises explicit criteria based on French, American, and UK guidelines, although the report is not explicit as to the selection process of guidelines or how incongruity between national guidelines was dealt with to reach consensus for the purposes of the tool. A specific grade of evidence was not stated, only that selecWed recommendaWions had afWer 2000\u00b5 (page 2, (115)). Given that all experts involved in the Delphi consensus were based in France, it may be that French practices and guidelines were given preference; in the references supporting the selected criteria, 27 are French, eight are American, and five are British. In addition, the selection of clinical indications was based upon French prevalence data. Given variation in prevalence of disease, availability of different formularies, and diversity in paediatric practice internationally, it is therefore probable that there will be some elements of a tool designed in the specific context of one country that may not be universally applicable internationally. There are a number of rational prescribing tools for adults or undifferentiated populations that are designed for use in a specific context, for example the Laroche Criteria (137) evaluate potentially inappropriate prescribing for older adults and are designed for use in France. Some tools have also been adapted for use in other settings, with various adaptation of the (US-based) Beers Criteria including the Maio Criteria (138) for use in Italy and the Lechevallier Criteria (139) for use in France. On the other hand, some rational prescribing tools are intentionally broad enough to be applicable in a wide range of settings, with perhaps the best example being the WHO prescribing indicators (140), which were described in Section 1.3.3 (page 10). Chapter 3: Developing the POPI UK criteria 60 The validity of rational prescribing criteria in clinical practice can be in a number of ways, as discussed in Section 1.4.2 (page 14). One approach is to test whether a higher level of irrational prescribing as identified by the tool correlates with adverse patient outcomes; a simpler approach is simply to evaluate the ability of the tool to identify types of irrational prescribing that occur in the target population. In a comparison of screening tools for inappropriate prescriptions in older people, Chang and Chen (61) found that all four of the tools that had been tested in their ability to reduce the prevalence of inappropriate prescribing were successful in doing so. None of the criteria they evaluated had been assessed in its ability to reduce negative clinical outcomes, an assessment that would require complex longitudinal studies. Another limitation of rational prescribing tools is that the Delphi method by which they are most commonly developed are eminence-based, which runs counter to the principles of evidence-based medicine (EBM) (141). However, while the POPI UK criteria are derived from propositions reached using the Delphi consensus method, these criteria have been subjected to two rounds of scrutiny from the perspective of EBM: firstly, the propositions were produced with reference to American, French and British guidelines; in the modification process, they were then each individually tested against the explicitly evidence-based guidelines produced by NICE, Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) and the BNFc. This method of producing the tool therefore draws upon an enormous body of evidence condensed into a relatively simple tool that is practical for clinical application. The study described in this chapter was designed to develop paediatric rational prescribing criteria that could be applied in any paediatric setting in the UK. The modification of an established tool to increase its applicability to another setting, commonly another country, has been used for a number of adult rational prescribing tools. For example, Beers criteria, developed in the USA, have been adapted for application in Germany, France, Italy and Austria (60). In other cases, entirely new rational prescribing tools have been developed anew through the Delphi consensus method, such as the development of the STOPP/START criteria in the UK (61). Chapter 3: Developing the POPI UK criteria 61 The approach used in this study was to evaluate the appropriateness of the original POPI criteria to application in the UK through comparison to the British National Formulary for Children (BNFc) and national clinical guidelines. The aim was to modify the tool where necessary for application to UK paediatric practice and therefore to facilitate further evaluation of the tool using UK prescribing data. The intention was to minimise changes to the tool as far as possible, so that it remained as far as possible the product of the original Delphi consensus, while making any amendments necessary to produce criteria relevant to evaluate prescribing against accepted standards in the UK. The development of the POPI UK criteria, reported in this chapter, has been disseminated in oral and poster presentations (118), and has also been peer-reviewed and published (142) (see Appendix 2). 3.2 Methods The 105 propositions of the POPI criteria were compared to evidence-based UK clinical guidelines and clinical knowledge summaries from NICE, SIGN, the BNFc, and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The national guidance from NICE, SIGN and the BNFc were preferred; EMA recommendations were referred to when no national guidelines were available. This process was based on the most recent guidelines available at the time the study was undertaken in October 2015. Where amendments were made, the specific related guideline is cited. Following comparison with the guidelines, there were three possible outcomes: 1. Guidelines concurred with the POPI criteria. No change was made. 2. There was partial discordance. POPI criteria were amended to match UK guidance. 3. There was no guidance available or the criterion was in complete discordance with UK guidance and the criterion was omitted. The final wording of the POPI UK criteria was reached as consensus in consultation with two paediatric clinical pharmacology consultants. Chapter 3: Developing the POPI UK criteria 62 3.3 Results The resulting POPI UK comprises 80 criteria. Having started with 105 propositions in the original POPI criteria, no change was made to 49 propositions. Twenty-nine were amended to concord more closely with UK guidelines. Four were reduced into two criteria where they could be combined with closely related propositions due to the relevant guidelines referring to them together, simplifying the tool. Twenty-three were omitted altogether, which included the omission of an entire category. One category title was amended\u00b3 from \u00b4aWWenWion the diagnosis of attention deficit disorder without hyperactivity is not in use in the UK; variants are described in the International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision (ICD-11) system describes subtypes without hyperactivity under the umbrella diagnosis of ADHD (143) . Appendix 7 shows the original POPI criteria and Appendix 8 the modified criteria comprising POPI UK. The most substantial single change was the omission of the category of \u00b4Mosquitos[sic]\u00b5. As there are not currently any areas of the UK where insect-borne diseases are endemic, this was not considered applicable to UK practice and therefore the category, comprising seven criteria, was removed. Twelve criteria were omitted due to a lack of relevant clinical guidelines. These are all listed in Chapter 3: Developing the POPI UK criteria 63 Table 3-A. In other cases, four criteria were omitted where UK clinical guidelines contradicted the proposition. These are listed in Chapter 3: Developing the POPI UK criteria 64 Table 3-B.

For example, diosmectite is not approved for use, helicidine is not available, and ethanolamine tenoate is not listed in the BNFc. In other instances, there was a lack of guidelines related to the topic, for instance in the case of first-line rectal administration of paracetamol; the possible reasons for absence of guidelines are further considered in the discussion in Section 3.4 (page 78).

The criteria listed in Chapter 3: Developing the POPI UK criteria 68 Table 3-B were omitted due to national guidelines in the UK conflicting with the statements, suggesting that it would not be reasonable to consider such prescribing behaviour irrational in the UK. The case of setrons for chemotherapy-associated nausea and vomiting is considered in more depth in the discussion, as their inclusion in the original POPI criteria seems unusual given that setrons are widely used internationally for this very indication (144). Two criteria were combined with closely related propositions where the recommendations were linked in a single UK guideline. The combined criteria are shown over page in Table 3-C.

It should be noted that, as Table 3-D shows, ibuprofen dosing is recommended as three to four times daily in the BNFc, however the modified criterion more closely mirrored the original POPI criterion by stating it should be dosed only three times daily. This was an error as the modified criterion does not therefore accurately represent UK national guidance. The error was detected after completion of validation studies, therefore modified POPI criteria referred to in subsequent chapters include this criterion.

The POPI tool was the first paediatric prescribing screening tool, and the modified tool was the first paediatric rational prescribing tool for use in the UK when it was developed for use in our research in 2016. It remains the only paediatric rational prescribing tool for application to paediatric practice outside primary care and is designed to closely reflect national clinical guidelines and prescribing practice. The POPI UK criteria have a number of potential applications: the tool could be used in a research context to estimate prevalence of irrational prescribing using basic prescribing data of medications and their indication on either a local or national level; it could also be used as a tool for service evaluation and quality improvement, for instance through use in audit. Chapter 3: Developing the POPI UK criteria 83 3.4.1 Criteria modified for inclusion in POPI UK Twenty-nine of the propositions of the original POPI criteria were amended. The majority of these changes were subtle modifications to bring the wording of propositions more closely in line with the specific wording of UK clinical guidelines. For example, \u00b4AnWips\\choWic drXgs Wo WreaW h\\peracWiYiW\\ disorder\u00b5. In other cases, the criteria contained specific differences such as age ranges or first-line drug recommendations and were amended accordingly. Examples of these include some criteria where the amendment increased the specificity of the proposition, such as changing from \u00b4The Xse of W\\pe H2 anWihisWamines for long periods of WreaWmenW\u00b5 Wo \u00b4The of recepWor amendmenW added complexity or subjectivity, in order to better reflect the UK guidance, for instance a criterion relaWing Wo aWopic ec]ema as a Wrial for severe itching or where sleep disturbance has a significanW impacW on Whe child or carers\u00b5. In order for this tool to be useful in appraising rational prescribing in the UK, it is important that prescribers are being measured against the specific standards they are striving for, and this would also facilitate straightforward interventions using UK guidelines for education and service improvement. 3.4.2 Criteria omitted from POPI UK For 22 criteria, there were no relevant UK clinical guidelines or guidelines were directly contradictory to the original POPI criterion. Absence from guidelines does not necessarily invalidate the recommendations of those criteria but they were omitted as they appeared to relate to irrational use of medicines that do not appear to be prevalent in the UK. In some cases, the propositions related to medications not available in the UK, for instance in the case of diosmectite for diarrhoea there is some emerging evidence supporting its use (145) but this is not reflected in UK availability of the product. Chapter 3: Developing the POPI UK criteria 84 In other cases, differences in national clinical practices may explain the absence if the type of irrational prescribing described is already rare in UK practice. This explanation likely underlies guidance about rectally administered drugs including paracetamol per rectum for pain and suppositories for cough. The cultural difference that may give rise to this variance in clinical practice was recognised in the EMA Guideline on pharmaceutical development of medicines for paediatric use (146) when discussing medication Whe UK\u00b5. Two of the omitted criteria, in relation to sucrose for painful procedures in infants and nitrofurantoin as prophylaxis for urinary infection, may be absent from national UK guidelines because these are areas where there is not a national consensus of best practice. In reviewing these topics, local guidelines were found to differ. Some UK guidelines were found recommending nitrofurantoin for prophylaxis (147, 148). In guidelines relating to sucrose for painful procedures, some UK guidelines preferred breast- or bottle-feeding over sucrose, described contraindications, and qualified the guideline according to gestation and age of infant (149, 150). In the absence of a unifying national guideline on these topics, they were therefore not considered to be good candidates for screening prescribing practice nationally. Four criteria were omitted due to the existence of UK clinical guidelines that were in direct conflict with the original proposition (see Chapter 3: Developing the POPI UK criteria 85 Table 3-B). Three of these appear to have been included as PIMs in the original French tool due to risk of interactions or side effects. One related to nitrofurantoin for treatment of urinary infections. According to the report describing the development of the original POPI tool, this criterion was derived from a statement issued by Agence Fran\u00e7aise de S\u00e9curit\u00e9 Sanitaire des Produits de Sant\u00e9 (AFSSAPS, the French Agency for the Safety of Health Products) in 2011 warning of cases of severe hepatic and pulmonary complications following long-term treatment with nitrofurantoin (151). The BNFc does recommend monitoring liver function and for pulmonary symptoms if prescribing nitrofurantoin long-term, but it is licensed and indicated in acute uncomplicated urinary tract infections for children aged 3 months and older (120) and is second-line for children aged 3 months and older in the most recent NICE guideline NG109 (152). The second related to isotretinoin and tetracycline antibiotics. This appears to be derived from a Good Practice Recommendation from AFSSAP describing isotretinoin as contraindicated with tetracyclines due to the reported occurrence of benign intracranial hypertension with this combination (153). This risk is recorded in the BNFc as a possible inWeracWion, raWed as \u00b4SerioXs\u00b5 ZiWh an anecdoWal eYidence base (120). The combination is not recorded as a contraindication and combined topical retinoids and oral tetracyclines and recommended in the NICE Clinical Knowledge Summary. The third related to fluoride supplements before age 6 months. The related French guideline, an AFSAPPS statement in 2008, recommended that fluoride-containing supplements such as toothpaste be commenced when teeth erupt, on average at age 6 months (154). This statement, like the relevant UK guidelines, discusses the risk of dental fluorosis with excess fluoride consumption during tooth development and recommends lower dose fluoride in toothpaste for young children. Both the NICE and SIGN guidelines quoted in Chapter 3: Developing the POPI UK criteria 86 Table 3-B acknowledge the risk of dental fluorosis and state that the benefit of reduced caries favours starting fluoride supplementation as soon as teeth erupt with no definitive lower age limit of benefit to the child. These all appear to reflect differing risk tolerance between the French and UK guidelines. In order that the modified tool reflects what is considered nationally to be good practice, the criteria were therefore omitted from the modified tool. The fourth omitted criterion lisWed \u00b4The Xse of seWrons YomiWing\u00b5 as a PIP. It was not clear what evidence was used to develop this proposition as none of the references in the report describing the development of the original tool related to chemotherapy-associated nausea and vomiting. The only reference mentioning setrons in the section explaining the evidence-base for each criterion was from the American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which recommended ondansetron as an effective anti-emetic for children, noting it is not usually required for gastroenteritis but not making any reference to chemotherapy (155). Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting is one of the listed indications for ondansetron in the BNFc (120). It is possible that the inclusion of this criterion in the original tool constitutes a typographical error, and that it was intended to read as an inappropriate omission given the importance of treating chemotherapy-associated nausea. It was therefore felt not to accurately reflect rational prescribing and was omitted from the modified tool. 3.4.3 Impact of the modification process on the criteria list Of the 105 criteria of the original POPI tool, the majority were amended or omitted, with 49 remaining unchanged. One entire clinical category was removed from the list, relating to mosquitoes. Otherwise, the breadth of clinical indications covered by the criteria remains unchanged. In addition, the range of categories of irrational prescribing described in the criteria (discussed in Section 2.4.4, page 36) remains equally broad. Examples from both the original POPI and Chapter 3: Developing the POPI UK criteria 87 POPI UK relating to various types of misprescribing, as well as over- and underprescribing, are shown over page in Table 3-G. Chapter 3: Developing the POPI UK criteria 88 Table 3-G: Examples of criteria relating to different categories of irrational prescribing Aspect of rational prescribing Example of related PIM or PIO from original POPI (theme) Example of related PIM or PIO from POPI UK (theme) Drug Nitrofurantoin used as a curative agent in children under six years (Urinary infections) Loperamide in the case of invasive diarrhoea (Diarrhoea) Dosage Oral solutions of ibuprofen administered in more than three doses per day using a graduated pipette of 10mg/kg (Pain and fever) Doses of ibuprofen administered in more than three doses per day or exceeding maximum dose of 30mg/kg over three doses per day (Pain and fever) Duplication The combined use of an oral and a local antibiotic (Acne vulgaris) The combined use of an oral and a local antibiotic (Acne vulgaris) Duration The use of H2 type antihistamines for long periods of treatment (Nausea, vomiting, or gastrooesophageal reflux) The use of H2 receptor antagonists for more than 4 weeks (Nausea, vomiting, or gastrooesophageal reflux) Drug-drug interaction Isotretinoin in combination with a member of the tetracycline family of antibiotics (Acne Vulgaris) The combined use of two NSAIDs (Pain and fever) Drug-disease interaction \u00df2 agonists, treat bronchiolitis (Bronchiolitis) Overprescribing Antibiotic treatment for a sore throat, without a positive rapid diagnosWic WesW\u00ab (ENT infecWions) Antibiotic treatment for a sore throat except in severe cases (ENT infections) Underprescribing Omission: Oral rehydration solution (Diarrhoea) Omission: Preventative treatment (inhaled corticosteroids) in the case of persistent asthma (Asthma) There is also no evidence that the modification of the tool had any impact on the degree of complexity, as represented by the proportion of criteria with implicit features. All modifications shown in Table 3-D and Table 3-E either maintained implicit features (that is, reference to patient characteristics or clinical details) or in one case changed a criterion from impliciW Wo e[pliciW: from \u00b4The applicaWion of ben]\\l ben]oaWe for periods longer Chapter 3: Developing the POPI UK criteria 89 Whan eighW hoXrs for infanWs girls\u00b5 Wo \u00b4Ben]\\l ben]oaWe\u00b5 as a PIM for children. In some cases, amendments increased the subjectivity of a criterion, such as the change to antibiotics for sore throats, shown as the example of overprescribing in Table 4-B above. However, others reduced subjectivity, such as the proposition relating to treatment of gastrooesophageal reflux with H2 receptor antagonists, shown as the example of misprescribing duration shown in Table 4-B, or Inhaler be appropriaWe\u00b5 shoZn in Table 3-E. Therefore, the POPI UK tool, like the original POPI tool, has mixed implicit and explicit features, with some criteria requiring the rater to make subjective assessments to determine appropriateness. 3.5 Conclusion The POPI UK criteria are the first rational prescribing tool designed to assess rational prescribing for children across any setting in the UK. The tool comprises 80 criteria describing PIMs and PIOs. Although the POPI UK criteria are founded in evidence-based practice, their usefulness and validity and usefulness required testing. As discussed in Chapter 2, both clinical validation and inter-rater reliability studies have been published for the original POPI tool. In order to assess the POPI UK criteria, two studies were undertaken to test, respectively, the clinical application and repeatability of the new criteria. Firstly, a clinical validation study was undertaken in which the criteria would be applied to inpatient and emergency deparWmenW prescripWions in a UK children\u00b7s hospiWal Wo idenWif\\ Whe proporWion of prescriptions that fall within the categories of the tool and any inappropriate prescriptions or omissions that it detects in that setting. This is described in Chapter 4. Secondly, a Chapter 3: Developing the POPI UK criteria 90 repeatability study was completed in which inter- and intra-rater agreement would be assessed to study the reliability of scores produced by using the criteria is described in Chapter 5. Chapter 4: Clinically assessing the POPI UK criteria 91 4 Clinically assessing the POPI UK criteria 4.1 Introduction This chapter describes the clinical assessment of the POPI UK criteria, with an overview of how rational prescribing tools are validated followed by the methodology and results of the study designed to evaluate the usefulness of the POPI UK criteria in UK paediatric practice. 4.1.1 Evaluating rational prescribing tools As discussed in Chapter 1, rational prescribing criteria enable research into the quality of prescribing. The reliability of any measurement can be described in terms of two paradigms: accuracy and precision. Accuracy (sometimes called validity) has been described as meaning Whe closeness of Whe measXremenWs Wo some e[Wernal \u00b4WrXe\u00b5 YalXe, or else to the results of a previously established gold standard(156). In particular, accuracy should be applied specifically to the results of measurement, rather than the measurement tool itself, as it is considered a descriptor of the meaningfulness of test results in serving a specific purpose(157). Precision (sometimes called reliability), on the other hand, has been described as reflecting the agreement between repeated measurements, whether scored by a single assessor at different times or scored by different assessors. There has been criticism of conflating precision with reliability, which in fact should take into account true variance (the variability that exists in the exWernal \u00b4WrXe\u00b5 precision usually only accommodates error variance (the variability that appears due to measurement error) (156). Nonetheless, for the purposes of this Whesis, \u00b4reliabiliW\\\u00b5 and \u00b4precision\u00b5 are used to mean the agreement between repeated measurements, accepting that this excludes some nuance in statistical terms. The analog\\ of a bXll\u00b7s what is being measured, and marks on the target represent values produced by measurement. Accurate measurements are close to the centre of the target, and a precise Chapter 4: Clinically assessing the POPI UK criteria 92 method of measurement will produce values that are close to one another. This is illustrated in Figure 4-1. Figure 4-1: The bXll\u00b7V-eye analogy of accuracy and precision A) Low accuracy, high precision; B) Low accuracy, low precision; C) High accuracy, low precision; D) High accuracy, high precision. Adapted from Streiner et al, 2006 (156). As discussed in Section 1.4, different types of rational prescribing tools have different utilities and may vary in terms of accuracy or usefulness. For example, implicit criteria may be more accurate than explicit criteria because they are patient-specific and take into account co-prescriptions and patient factors (59). However, implicit criteria rely upon subjective judgements or understanding of clinical context by the assessor (15) meaning that they necessitate skilled or even expert assessors and may have lower precision. Correspondingl\\, of rational prescribing due to inability to take into account individual patient factors or regional differences (for instance, in the case of differing patterns of antibiotic resistance Chapter 4: Clinically assessing the POPI UK criteria 93 in different regions) (15), but these may have higher precision due to the objectivity of the criteria, represented by example A in Figure 4-1. Implicit criteria, which may be more accurate but less precise, are represented by example C. Also described briefly in Section 1.4, there are several potential approaches to testing the accuracy and precision of rational prescribing tools. Their accuracy can be considered in two different ways. Firstly, the accuracy of a rational prescribing tool could reflect the degree to which it detects true rates of rational and irrational prescribing, as compared to their true incidence (which is unknowable) or to their measurement by another tool. Alternatively, bearing in mind that accuracy relates to the test results in the context of a specific purpose, the accuracy of rational prescribing tools could be considered to reflect the degree to which a tool detects rates of rational and irrational prescribing as correspond with adverse drug events or patient outcomes. In other words, the accuracy of a rational prescribing tool could be considered either its sensitivity to detecting non-gold standard prescribing, or its closeness of correlation with patient outcomes. In order to be amenable to a clinical validation study, rational prescribing tools must either be limited to criteria that can be applied to large datasets that are already available, or authors must carry out a large, complex and costly study to collect all data required prospectively and follow-up patient outcomes. In their 2013 systematic review of rational prescribing tools for adults, Kaufmann et al found that 39 of the 46 tools they described had not had any clinical validation studies assessing correlation with patient outcomes (60). These studies had demonstrated correlation between potentially irrational prescribing as indicated by the tools and adverse patient outcomes, including probability of hospitalisation and risk of adverse drug reactions. Many rational prescribing tools without clinical validation studies have instead been studied in their ability to detect potentially irrational prescribing in an appropriate clinical context. Without a comparator, these studies cannot be considered assessments of the accXrac\\ of Whe Wools, as Whe \u00b4WrXe\u00b5 YalXe for potentially irrational prescriptions in those populations is not known. However, these studies do provide evidence of the potential usefulness of the tools by demonstrating their ability to highlight some inappropriate prescriptions and identifying the types of PIMs or PIOs the tool finds. They could Chapter 4: Clinically assessing the POPI UK criteria 94 therefore be used to study these types of irrational prescribing futher, for instance investigating causative factors or interventions designed to improve rational prescribing. As the POPI criteria were the first rational prescribing tool published for paediatric applications, and the only extant tool at the time of this work, it was not possible to design a protocol that compared the POPI UK criteria to an alternative measurement. Since the completion of the study reported in this chaper, a clinical validation study of the original POPI criteria has been published; this is discussed in comparison with the POPI UK study in 4.7.4. 4.2 Aims The purpose of this study was to evaluate the applicability of the POPI UK criteria in clinical pracWice in a UK children\u00b7s hospiWal. The primary objective was to identify what proportion of children received prescriptions that can be assessed using the POPI UK criteria, and thereby to test the relevance of the tool in a UK paediatric population. The secondary objectives were to assess rational prescribing according to the POPI UK criteria by: x recording instances of PIMs or PIOs in screened prescriptions x recording the setting of prescription and test whether there is any difference in rates of rational prescribing between settings, with the null hypothesis that there will be no difference between settings x recording the age of patients and test whether there is any difference in rates of rational prescribing between age groups (infant, child and adolescent), with the null hypothesis that there will be no difference between patient groups Chapter 4: Clinically assessing the POPI UK criteria 95 4.3 Methods 4.3.1 Study design The POPI UK tool was used to prospectively assess paediatric prescriptions with a cross-secWional approach (i.e. Zas scored againsW Whe POPI criWeria aW a single point in time), with reference to patient notes for information on symptoms and diagnoses, in inpatient and emergency department settings in the Royal Derby Hospital, Derby. This did not replace any usual practice of on-going review of prescriptions, for instance by clinical pharmacists. Using retrospective pre-anonymised data was considered as an alternative to prospective data collection, however the POPI criteria require contemporaneous information about parWicipanWs\u00b7 s\\mpWoms and As a combinaWion of paper and elecWronic prescribing and paper and electronic medical record-keeping was in use in the Royal Derby Hospital at the time of data collection, prospective recruitment was felt to be a more reliable method of ensuring complete data collection. For example, some patients received handwritten outpatient prescripWions from Whe Children\u00b7s Emergenc\\ Department; these did not automatically produce copies for filing on discharge and therefore information of how the prescription was written would not be available for retrospective analysis. This was necessary for full evaluation under the POPI criteria, for instance of the way in which liquid formulations have been prescribed (by dose and volume). 4.3.2 Recruitment Participants were recruited from current inpatients in the paediatric inpatient wards and Whe Children\u00b7s Emergency Department (children\u00b7s ED) at the Royal Derby Hospital. All children in these departments were eligible for recruitment whether or not they presented with illnesses within the remit of the POPI criteria, and whether or not any medications were prescribed. The aim was to recruit 300 participants in each setting (sample size is discussed in 4.5.2). Chapter 4: Clinically assessing the POPI UK criteria 96 Recruitment was undertaken between August 2016 and February 2017. All recruitment was undertaken during the day, including all days of the week. 4.3.3 Eligibility criteria 4.3.3.1 Inclusion criteria x Age 0-15 years with parent/carer consent and optional assent or 16-18 with their own informed consent x Inpatient in a paediatric ward or aWWendee Wo Whe Children\u00b7s Emergenc\\ Department (children\u00b7s ED) at the Royal Derby Hospital 4.3.3.2 Exclusion criteria x Lack of good English language skills in the consenting parent/guardian and patient. x Lack of informed consent given by parent/guardian in children aged 0-15 years, declining to assent aged 6-15 years or lack of consent in participants aged 16-18 years 4.3.4 Participant information literature Parental participant information sheets and age-appropriate leaflets were developed to provide families with information about the study prior to obtaining consent. There is evidence that participant information provided in the course of research studies is often difficult for participants to read(158), which presents ethical challenges in ensuring consent is fully informed. As discussed in Chapter 1.8.2, research that involves children may be perceived as more challenging because is likely to include children with varying developmental ages and literacy levels, all of whom must be catered for in the process of providing participants ZiWh informaWion. HoZeYer, Zhile children\u00b7s differing deYelopmenWal ages are likel\\ Wo be taken into account, it is often not considered that more than a quarter of adults in the UK haYe loZ liWerac\\ qXanWiWaWiYe Chapter 4: Clinically assessing POPI UK criteria 97 reasoning or haYe difficXlW\\ ZiWh simple ZriWWen informaWion\u00b5(97). Readability assessments of sample educational materials intended to support informed consent have shown that texts produced in institutions with guidelines recommending language at a set reading level- the most common standard was eighth grade, the average reading level of adults in the US (159)- less than 10% meet this standard (160). Strategies such as improving the readability of educational materials through ensuring that they use simple language, are short, clearly organised, and illustrated with images, and providing concurrent verbal information with the written information have been shown to improve understanding, although they do not entirely mitigate the effects of low literacy (91). These strategies are equally appropriate in research involving children as in adult sWXdies, and iW is imporWanW Wo consider parenWal liWerac\\ as Zell as Whe child\u00b7s developmental stage and literacy. For these reasons, in order to design information sheets that were accessible and useful to families, several steps were taken to maximise the readability and usefulness of the participant information sheets. All of the development and design of leaflets was undertaken by the author. Firstly, parental information leaflets and information posters were designed. The drafts were then tested for accessibility and usefulness by attendance at the paediatric outpatient department and discussion of their design and content with families attending clinics, which included children of ages ranging from 1 year to 15 years. The majority of feedback was posiWiYe, sXch as commenWs of, \u00b4IW e[plains eYer\\Whing\u00b5 and \u00b4IW is self-e[planaWor\\\u00b5. Specific positive features included the detail about data storage, and a comment on the language being accessible for a family for whom English was a second language. However, one parenW made her concerned that her child might be being exposed to medication errors. Another parent felW WhaW Whe POPI criWeria would be helpful. Taking into account participant and parent feedback, parental leaflets were redesigned, and then further designed leaflets containing the same information in simplified language Chapter 4: Clinically assessing the POPI UK criteria 98 and with additional pictures for children. These were designed by age group, for participants aged 16-18 years, 13-15 years, and 6-13 years. All leaflets were evaluated using Microsoft Word in-built readability statistics, which provide a Flesch-Kincaid reading grade level. This is a score that is used to reflect the number of years of education that might be required to understand a text, and it has been widely used to evaluate patient information material (160-162). The score takes into account length of sentences and average number of syllables in words to represent complexity of text. All leaflets were designed with the aim of a reading grade level less than 8.0, which corresponds approximately to an age of thirteen years. Work was then undertaken to amend the parent information sheets to achieve a Kincaid reading grade of 8.8 (see Appendix 9); this was partly limited by needing to include contact information for researchers including many pol\\s\\llabic Zords, e.g. \u00b4XniYersiW\\\u00b5 and \u00b4deparWmenW\u00b5. The age-appropriate leaflets for ages 6-13 years were designed aiming for a lower age grade. Although grade 1 would approximately correspond to age six, this readability level was not targeted as it is extremely limiting given that polysyllabic words such as \u00b4medicines\u00b5 and \u00b4children\u00b5 needed Wo appear in Whe sheeW. The drafW of Whe age 6-13 participant information leaflet achieved a Kincaid reading grade of 4.1 (see Error! Reference source not found.10). The draft of the age 13-15 years leaflet and 16-18 leaflet (which used the same body text) achieved a Kincaid reading grade of 8.4, corresponding approximately to a reading age of 13 years (see Appendices 11 and 12). However, subsequent to the design of the participant and parental information sheets, after submission to the University ethics board, required phrasing had to be introduced for many sections to meet University requirements of specific language that had to be included in any participant information sheets used in University research. These rules did not mandate changing the information sheets for children under the age of 16 years but required inclusion of mandatory phrases in all parental information sheets and those for participants aged 16-18 years who might be consenting for themselves. The leaflets were therefore redesigned using the University mandated language (see Error! Reference source not found. 13). As a result, the Kincaid reading grade of each was 9.5, corresponding approximately to a reading age of 15 years, above the recommended readability standard of most institutions. Chapter 4: Clinically assessing the POPI UK criteria 99 Chapter 4: Clinically assessing the POPI UK criteria 100 4.3.5 Data collection Families were approached by a researcher, who explained the study and sought informed consent for participation. As discussed in 4.3.4 written participant information sheets were provided to parents, with age-appropriate information leaflets for children (see Appendices 10, 11, and 13). After consent was given, there was no further active involvement with the participant. The author fulfilled the role of researcher for the majority of recruitment (86%), with assistance from two research nurses, Janine Abramson and Coral Smith, who recruited 14% of participants. The researcher reYieZed Whe parWicipanWs\u00b7 deparWmenW and Wranscribed daWa from Whe parWicipanWs\u00b7 prescriptions and medical notes onto a case report form (CRF), see Figure 4-2. POPI UK criteria were recorded using codes for relevant diagnoses and PIMs or PIOs with reference to a POPI UK criteria code document (see Appendix 8).

In addition, the University of Nottingham Research & Development department approved and sponsored the study (Appendix 15). Trust approval was granted by the Derby Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (Appendix 16). 4.5 Statistical analysis 4.5.1 Methods of statistical analysis All data were analysed in Microsoft Excel. Analysis included calculation of mean and median number of prescriptions per child, rates of inappropriate prescribing types according to the POPI screening tool, and calculation of difference between mean rates of inappropriate prescribing in different age groups, sex, and by types of prescribers using the chi-squared test. 4.5.2 Sample size and justification A sample size power calculation was not calculated, as there are no relevant data available about expected proportions of participants who will fall within the POPI UK criteria to inform a power calculation. The WHO have recommended a sample size of 600 clinical encounters in total in studies evaluating rational prescribing (54) Therefore, the target was to recruit 300 patients for each clinical area, with a total of 600 patients recruited. 4.6 Results 4.6.1 Population characteristics In total, 598 participants were recruited (due to erroneous numbering of consecutive consented patients) with 299 patients recruited from the paediatric inpatient wards and Chapter 4: Clinically assessing the POPI UK criteria 105 299 from Whe Children\u00b7s Emergenc\\ DeparWmenW (children\u00b7s ED). A total of 1,608 prescriptions were analysed, of which 1,279 were prescribed for the inpatient population, and 329 in the ED. Patient demographics including clinical (diagnostic) codes and common medications prescribed are shown in Table 4-A.

Corresponding with this finding, the two most common prescriptions were paracetamol and ibuprofen, prescribed to 316 and 205 participants respectively. Alongside analgesia, common medication groups included antibiotics, bronchodilators and antiemetics, as well as prednisolone and oral fluids. The latter, oral fluids, are not prescription-only or even medication in the usual definition. However, documentation of oral fluid challenges or treatment was documented alongside prescribing data in order to assess relevant criteria related to oral rehydration solution for diarrhoea or vomiting. Prescriber background could not be recorded for all prescriptions, but prescribers included a range of backgrounds and experience including paediatric consultants, paediatric specialty trainees, GP trainees, and nurse practitioners. 4.6.2 Evaluation of POPI UK criteria: relevance to study population The primary aim of this study was to identify what proportion of children received prescriptions that can be assessed using the POPI UK criteria. Out of 598 patients, 574 had at least one documented symptom or diagnosis included in the POPI UK criteria; 292 patients in the inpatient group and 282 in the emergency department group. The most frequent was pain or fever (373), with other frequent indications being vitamin supplements and antibiotic prophylaxis (242), nausea, vomiting or gastro-oesophageal reflux (162), cough (102), and ENT infections (51). Some patients had symptoms or diagnoses that related to multiple categories. Six categories were not relevant to any patients in the study population. The number of patients presenting with symptoms or diagnoses relevant to each of the categories in the tool is shown over page in Table 4-B. Chapter 4: Clinically assessing the POPI UK criteria 108 Table 4-B: Patients with symptoms or diagnoses related to each POPI UK category POPI UK tool category Number of patients presenting with related symptoms or diagnosis (by setting) Inpatient ED Total Pain and fever 183 190 373 Vitamin supplements and antibiotic prophylaxis 115 127 242 Nausea, vomiting, or gastrooesophageal reflux 97 65 162 Cough 65 37 102 ENT infections 20 31 51 Diarrhoea 29 17 46 Urinary infections 17 3 20 Bronchiolitis 13 2 15 Asthma 7 4 11 Atopic eczema 4 3 7 Epilepsy 5 1 6 Herpes simplex 1 0 1 Depression 0 1 1 Anorexia 1 0 1 ADHD 1 0 1 Acne vulgaris 0 0 0 Scabies 0 0 0 Lice 0 0 0 Ringworm 0 0 0 Impetigo 0 0 0 Nocturnal enuresis 0 0 0 There were a number of frequent diagnoses that are not contained within any of the categories of the POPI UK criteria. Uncoded diagnoses with at least fifteen cases in the study population were: lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI), viral-induced wheeze, appendicitis, sepsis, soft tissue injury, and fracture. These are listed in Table 4-C. Chapter 4: Clinically assessing the POPI UK criteria 109 Table 4-C: Common diagnoses in study population that are not contained in the POPI UK criteria Diagnosis Number of cases in study population Viral-induced wheeze 50 Sepsis 46 Soft tissue injury 39 Lower respiratory tract infection 34 Appendicitis 20 Head injury 18 Meningitis 16 Jaundice 15 The most common uncoded diagnosis found in the study population was viral-induced wheeze, followed by sepsis and soft tissue injury. Only seven of the original categories in the tool had more cases than those listed in Table 4-C. 4.6.3 Potentially inappropriate medicines and omissions detected by the POPI UK criteria One secondary aim was to identify any instances of PIMs or PIOs in the study population. There were 282 instances of PIMs and PIOs identified in 261 of the 598 (44%) participants, with more than one PIP/PIO for some participants. The categories of identified potentially inappropriate prescribing are shown in Table 4-D. Table 4-D: Categories of identified PIMs and PIOs Clinical category Number Vitamins and Antibiotic Prophylaxis 242 Pain and fever 30 Bronchiolitis 4 Nausea, vomiting and gastro-oesophageal reflux 2 Atopic eczema 2 ENT infection 1 Asthma 1 Total 282 Chapter 4: Clinically assessing the POPI UK criteria 110 As shown in Table 4-D, the majority of PIMs and PIOs fell within just two categories: 242 related to vitamins and antibiotics prophylaxis, 30 related to pain and fever. The related clinical categories of all identified PIMs/PIOs are further broken down in Table 4-E. Table 4-E: Specific PIMs and PIOs detected Clinical category Criterion No of cases Vitamins and Antibiotic Prophylaxis Omission: Healthy Start vitamins for infants and children 6 months- 5 years or having less than 500mL infant formula per day 242 Pain and fever Omission: Failure to give an osmotic laxative to patients being treated with morphine for a period of more than 48 hours 22 Inappropriate prescription: Prescription of two alternating antipyretics as a first-line treatment 7 Inappropriate prescription: Prescription of a medication other than paracetamol or ibuprofen as a first-line treatment for pain (except in the case of migraine) 1 Bronchiolitis Inappropriate prescription: Antibiotics, \u00df2 agonists or corticosteroids to treat 4 Nausea, vomiting and gastro-oesophageal reflux Inappropriate prescription: Acid-suppressing drugs to treat overt regurgitation in the absence of feeding difficulties, distress, or faltering growth 1 Omission: Oral rehydration solution (ORS) for dehydrated children unless IV fluid therapy is indicated (shock, red flag symptoms despite ORS, persist vomiting of ORS) 1 Atopic eczema Inappropriate prescription: More than one application per day of a dermocorticoid, except in cases of severe lichenification 1 Inappropriate prescription: Prescription of antihistamines except as a trial for severe itching or where sleep disturbance has a significant impact on the child or carers 1 ENT infection Inappropriate prescription: An antibiotic for < 4 days symptoms of acute upper respiratory tract infection except: x bilateral acute otitis media in children younger than 2 years x acute otitis media in children with otorrhoea x acute sore throat/acute pharyngitis/acute tonsillitis when three or more Centor criteria are present. 1 Asthma Omission: Preventative treatment (inhaled corticosteroids) in the case of persistent asthma 1 Chapter 4: Clinically assessing the POPI UK criteria 111 As Table 4-E shows, a single criterion relating to vitamins dominated, with 242 cases related to that criterion alone. There were several other criterion with multiple identified instances, two in the category of pain and fever, and one relating to bronchiolitis. In 38 prescriptions, it was not possible to determine whether or not an inappropriate prescription or omission had occurred according to the POPI UK criteria. In some cases, there was uncertainty about a PIM or PIO in more than one category. The specific criteria cited and reasons for uncertainty are listed in Table 4-F. Table 4-F: Cases where it was not possible to determine whether a PIM/PIO had been made according to the POPI UK criteria Clinical category Criterion Reason for uncertainty Number of cases Nausea, vomiting, or gastro-oesophageal reflux Omission: Oral rehydration solution (ORS) for dehydrated children unless IV fluid therapy is indicated (shock, red flag symptoms despite ORS, persist vomiting of ORS) distress, or faltering growth Types of oral fluids used for oral fluid challenge not specified 12 Indication for GORD treatment not documented 3 Inappropriate prescription: Acid-suppressing drugs to treat overt regurgitation in the absence of feeding difficulties, Hydration status not specified 2 SXbjecWiYe: \u00b4disWress\u00b5 1 Diarrhoea Omission: Oral rehydration solution (ORS) for dehydrated children unless IV fluid therapy is indicated (shock, red flag symptoms despite ORS, persist vomiting of ORS) Type of oral fluids used for oral fluid challenge not specified 4 Hydration status not documented 2 ENT infections Inappropriate prescription: An antibiotic for < 4 days symptoms of acute upper Centor criteria not documented 4 Duration of symptoms not documented 1 Chapter 4: Clinically assessing the POPI UK criteria 112 respiratory tract infection (except: x bilateral acute otitis media in children younger than 2 years x acute otitis media in children with otorrhoea acute sore throat/acute pharyngitis/acute tonsillitis when three or more Centor criteria are present.

For instance, laxatives would clearly be inappropriate in the context of diarrhoea, despite ongoing prescription of potentially constipating opiates. In other instances, overview of clinical documentation and prescriptions did not provide adequate information, such as frequency of application of a topical prescription, or the presence or absence of growth documentation elsewhere. 4.6.4 Settings of prescribing and rates of potentially inappropriate prescribing Another secondary aim of this study was to evaluate whether there was any difference in rates of rational prescribing between settings. A null hypothesis of no difference was not assessed with statistical testing as it was deemed that the numbers were not sufficient for meaningful testing. However, the rates of PIMs and PIOs detected did differ between the two settings sWXdied, a children\u00b7s emergenc\\ deparWmenW and an inpaWienW Zard. As discussed above, the distribution of age of participants presenting to the two settings was quite different, as illustrated in Figure 4-3 and Figure 4-4, with many more patients aged less than 1 year in the inpatient population (36%) compared with the emergency department (14%). Another important difference between settings was the number of medicines prescribed. A total of 1,608 medications were prescribed for the study population as a whole. 1,279 were prescribed for patients in the Inpatient setting, and only 329 for patients in the ED. The rates of potentially irrational prescribing in each setting therefore need to be evaluated in the context of the number of children with relevant indications and the total number of medicines prescribed. In total, 14 PIMs were identified in the inpatient setting and two in the ED. These are further subdivided by clinical category in Table 4-G. PIOs were again affected by the high rates in the vitamins category, with 138 PIOs in the inpatient setting and 128 in the ED. Excluding the vitamins category, there were 23 PIOs identified in the inpatient group and one in the ED. Chapter 4: Clinically assessing the POPI UK criteria 114 Table 4-G: Inappropriate prescriptions and omissions by setting Inappropriate prescriptions Inappropriate omissions Clinical category Inpatient ED Inpatient ED Vitamins and antibiotic prophylaxis 0 0 115 127 Pain and fever 7 1 21 1 Bronchiolitis 4 0 0 0 Nausea, vomiting and gastro-oesophageal reflux 1 0 1 0 Atopic eczema 2 0 0 0 ENT infection 0 1 0 0 Asthma 0 0 1 0 Total (excluding vitamins) 14 2 138 (23) 128 (1) As this shows, the inpatient population had more potentially inappropriate prescribing identified in both categories, whether the vitamins category was included or not. Most striking were the higher number of PIMs, half of which were due to PIMs relating to pain and fever. In order to take into account the different numbers of patients within relevant categories in the different settings, the numbers of PIMs/PIOs identified need to be considered in the context of total numbers of prescriptions. The number of PIMs/PIOs as compared with total number of medicines prescribed is shown below in Table 4-H. Table 4-H: Numbers of prescriptions and potential irrational prescribing by setting Setting Number of prescriptions PIMs PIOs Total PIMs and PIOs Inpatient 1,279 14 138 152 ED 329 2 128 130 The higher rates of potentially inappropriate describing identified in the inpatient group and possible reasons for this finding are discussed further in 4.7.2.3. Chapter 4: Clinically assessing the POPI UK criteria 115 4.6.5 Age of participants and potentially inappropriate describing Identified instances of either type of potentially inappropriate prescribing were not evenly distributed across the age groups, with a much higher proportion occurring in the 1 to 5 year age group, as shown in Table 4-I below. Table 4-I: Rates of potentially inappropriate prescribing by age group Age group Number of participants Number with potentially inappropriate prescribing identified (%) <1 year 152 38 (25) 1 to 5 years 208 208 (100) 6 to 10 years 115 6 (5) 11 to 15 years 97 5 (5) > 15 years 26 4 (15) Clearly, this result is significantly affected by the fact that the vitamin criterion related to all participants between age 6 months and 5 years. Excluding this criterion, rates by age group are shown in Table 4-J. Table 4-J: Rates of potentially inappropriate prescribing excluding vitamin criterion by age group Age group Number of participants Number with potentially inappropriate prescribing (%) <1 year 152 8 (5) 1 to 5 years 208 14 (7) 6 to 10 years 115 6 (5) 11 to 15 years 97 5 (5) > 15 years 26 4 (15) This shows that while potentially inappropriate prescribing occurred most often in the 1-5 years age group, as a proportion of the population the group over 15 years was more affected, with 15% of this group having either a PIP or PIO. Chapter 4: Clinically assessing the POPI UK criteria 116 4.7 Discussion 4.7.1 Appropriateness of clinical categories in the POPI UK criteria to the study population This study demonstrated that the POPI UK criteria were applicable to a large majority of patients (574/598, 96%). However, two categories contributed a large number of patients to this finding. The category of vitamin supplements and antibiotic prophylaxis was relevant to 242 patients, all of which were due to patient age (with one criterion stating that an inappropriate omission would be the omission of Healthy Start vitamins for infants and children aged 6 months to 5 years or having less than 500mL infant formula per day). This captured a large proportion of the study population, of which a quarter were aged under 1 year and 60% under 6 years. Forty-three of these patients presented with vitamin supplements and antibiotic prophylaxis as their only relevant clinical condition, while 199 had concurrent symptoms or diagnoses relevant to other categories. Pain and fever was also a category relevant to many patients (373/598) with a range of diagnoses that presented with the symptoms of pain or fever. Of these, 232/373 presented with other categories included in the criteria and 141/373 presented with pain and fever as their only included clinical condition. Excluding these two categories, only 35% (390/598) still had a symptom or condition that is included in the tool. In the category of vitamins and antibiotic prophylaxis, every patient between 6 months and 5 years of age was considered as having a PIO, in that Healthy Start vitamins were not prescribed for any child in this study, as per the criterion. However, in collecting data from clinical notes, it was not possible to determine whether patients were receiving infant formula, or the volume if so. Coding this as a PIO unknown for all patients under two years was considered, as a diet high in infant formula was considered possible, but the precise cut-off would have been chosen without good evidence base. Absence of recording adequate infant formula in the diet was therefore accepted as evidence that the omission was not a rational decision and so falls within irrational prescribing. Chapter 4: Clinically assessing the POPI UK criteria 117 While alternative data collection methods would be able to access detailed dietary information, for instance via data collection from parents, this is a serious limitation for a tool aiming to assess quality of prescribing, as it cannot be scored from prescribing and clinical coding data. This limitation is also true of a number of other criteria, for instance the omission \u00b4Recording a growth chart (height and weight) if the patient is taking methylphenidate\u00b5 for patients with ADHD as shown in Table 4-F. A full list of criteria that may not be measurable from prescribing and clinical coding data alone is shown in Table 4-K. Some of these criteria could have been coded as PIOs on the same basis, for the 102 patients presenting with cough, one with anorexia and one with ADHD. Table 4-K: POPI UK criteria that cannot be scored using only prescribing and clinical coding data Clinical category Criterion Vitamin Supplements and Antibiotic Prophylaxis Healthy Start vitamins for infants and children 6 months- 5 years or having less than 500mL infant formula per day Cough Failure to propose a whooping cough vaccine for pregnant women. Scabies Decontamination of household linen and clothes and same day treatment of all members of the household Anorexia Prescription of medications as a sole or primary treatment for anorexia nervosa ADHD Recording a growth chart (height and weight) if the patient is taking methylphenidate In the case of the criterion related to scabies, no patients were recorded with this indication. The one patient with anorexia nervosa did not have any medications prescribed, making iW clear Whe PIM of \u00b4Prescription of medications as a sole or primary treatment for anorexia nervosa\u00b5 did not apply. In other cases, the decision against this approach was subjective. For instance, in no instance was the presence of a pregnant woman noted in the patient records of cases of cough, therefore it seemed unreasonable to record absence of documentation about advice for whooping cough vaccine as a PIO. The results demonstrate that pain and fever are highly prevalent conditions in the paediatric population attending the emergency department and those admitted as inpatients and are therefore appropriate targets for studying rational prescribing. Chapter 4: Clinically assessing the POPI UK criteria 118 However, when the categories of pain and fever and vitamin supplements and antibiotic prophylaxis are excluded, approximately two-thirds (65%) of patients in this population had no presenting symptoms or diagnoses that are contained within the tool. The diagnoses in Table 4-C may represent further appropriate conditions to consider when assessing quality of prescribing, if a broadly inclusive strategy such as POPI is being used. For example, viral-induced wheeze is a condition for which the management has changed substantially and repeatedly in recent years (163, 164). While controversy remains around some approaches to treatment, other treatments are known to be ineffective but continue to be prescribed (165). Sepsis is also a frequent condition observed in the study population that is not included in POPI UK. This is a condition known to be time-critical in terms of pharmaceutical management with antimicrobial therapy in both adults (166) and children (167), with strong evidence for reduced mortality and organ failure resulting from optimal prescribing (i.e. antimicrobial therapy within one hour of recognition of sepsis), suggesting this would be a valuable target for improving prescribing practice. 4.7.2 Potentially inappropriate medicines and omissions detected in this study In total, 282 PIOs or PIOS were detected, out of 1,607 prescriptions, with a rate of 17.5%. These occurred in 258 of the 598 participants (43%), with more than one PIM/PIO in for there to be more than one PIM/PIO for a single prescription within the POPI UK criteria. For example, a patient prescribed morphine as the only treatment for pain for several days would have both a PIM and a PIO (Inappropriate medicine: Prescription of a medication other than paracetamol or ibuprofen as a first-line treatment for pain (except in the case of migraine) and Omission: Failure to give an osmotic laxative to patients being treated with morphine for a period of more than 48 hours). If this patient were the only participant studied, this would generate a PIM/PIO rate of 200%. Chapter 4: Clinically assessing the POPI UK criteria 119 4.7.2.1 Comparing potentially inappropriate medicines and potentially inappropriate omissions Of the 282 PIM/PIOs, only sixteen comprised PIMs, while 266 were PIOs. Out of 1,607 prescriptions, this represents a 1% rate of PIMs and 16.4% rate of PIOs. However, a large majority of omissions related to a single vitamin-related criterion (discussed in detail below); excluding the Health Start vitamin criterion, there were 24 PIOs, a rate of 1.5%. 4.7.2.2 Comparing potential irrational prescribing within each clinical category The most common category in which potentially irrational prescribing was detected was vitamin supplements and antibiotic prophylaxis, specifically in prescription of Healthy Start vitamins (239 cases). There were no prescriptions of Healthy Start vitamins to any patient in the study population. Given this complete omission, it seems possible that rather than this representing a 100% PIO rate in the study population, this may instead demonstrate that the criterion is not appropriate for evaluation of prescriptions. The NHS website with patient and healthcare professional information about Healthy Start vitamins (168) describes distribution points in England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Island, including inviting parents to apply for coupons by post or by contacting midwives or health visitors. This highlights that the usual source of Healthy Start vitamins is unlikely to be via prescription and might not therefore be detected in an inpatient setting if parents continue to give these to their children even in hospital. Alternatively, this may demonstrate a genuine deficit; it would be useful to evaluate the nutritional guidelines of UK paediatric hospitals to assess whether nutritional supplements are considered and whether vitamins are provided as non-prescribed nutritional supplements, intentionally omitted during inpatient stays, or unintentionally omitted during inpatient stays. Excluding the vitamin PIO from analysis, there were 40 PIMs/PIOs identified, with a rate of 2.5%. Thirty-seven of these were in the inpatient group (a rate of 2.9%) and three in the emergency department (a rate of 0.9%). The second most frequently detected potentially irrational prescribing was the PIO of \u00b4FailXre Wo Wo paWienWs more Whan 48 hoXrs\u00b5, Zhich occXrred in 22 cases. Of those cases, 21 occurred in the Chapter 4: Clinically assessing the POPI UK criteria 120 inpatient setting and one in the emergency department, which may reflect the increased likelihood of sWrong analgesia being giYen as a \u00b4sWaW\u00b5 or one-off prescription in the emergency setting, as compared with patients receiving more than 48 hours of care in the inpatient setting. The third most frequent potentially irrational prescribing was also in the category of Pain and FeYer, \u00b4PrescripWion of WZo alWernaWing anWip\\reWics as a firsW-line WreaWmenW\u00b5. seven instances of this PIM occurred in the inpatient setting, which may again highlight that this is a type of irrational prescribing to which patients may be more vulnerable during on-going periods of treatment compared to periods of assessment and initial management. However, this may also reflect difficulty in capturing data about use of non-prescribed medicines in an outpatient population, as two commonly used antipyretics in the UK, ibuprofen and paracetamol, are both available without prescription. Therefore parental use of these medications would be important contributors to their use, both rational and irrational, but would not be captured through analysis of prescribing. The only other potentially irrational prescribing detected more than once was in the category of Bronchiolitis, the PIM of \u00b4AnWibioWics, \u00df2 agonists or corticosteroids to treat bronchioliWis\u00b5. This Zas detected in four cases, again all in the inpatient setting. The specific potentially inappropriate medicines prescribed for patients with the diagnosis of bronchiolitis were antibiotics (\u00df2 agonist). may relate to the diagnostic uncertainty between severe bronchiolitis and bacterial lower respiratory tract infection, however these cases were only coded as potentially irrational prescribing if there were no alternative diagnoses case noWes bXW sepsis, ? bronchioliWis\u00b5 and in Whe second case, \u00b4? chest infection, ? bronchioliWis\u00b5, documenting clinical uncertainty around the diagnosis. 4.7.2.3 Comparing inpatient versus emergency department populations There was a substantial difference in the number of prescriptions between the two populations. There were 1,279 prescriptions for the patients in the inpatient population, compared with 329 prescriptions for the patients in the emergency department. This may Chapter 4: Clinically assessing the POPI UK criteria 121 reflect the higher complexity and morbidity of children who require inpatient admission, as well as some participants being on regular medications that were not required to be prescribed while in the emergency department, but which would have appeared in their prescriptions once admitted. There were 152 PIMs/PIOs in a total 1,279 prescriptions (12%) in the inpatient population, and 130 PIMs/PIOs in the emergency department out of 329 prescriptions (40%). This shows that while there were more PIMs/PIOs detected in the inpatient group, there was a much higher rate in the emergency department when the lower number of prescriptions per patient is taken into account. However, excluding the vitamin category, there were only 37 instances of potentially irrational prescribing in the inpatient population and three in the emergency department population. This is due to the effect of differences in the age of participants in the different settings, as the vitamin-related PIO applied to all patients age 6 months to 5 years. There were many more participants in this category in the inpatient compared with the emergency department population. The clinical categories in which potentially irrational prescribing was detected also differed between the populations. These are shown below in Table 4-L. Table 4-L: Clinical categories of potential PIMs and PIOs in the inpatient and emergency department populations Clinical category Number of PIMS and PIOs/number of patients with relevant clinical category (%) Inpatient Emergency department Vitamin supplements and antibiotic prophylaxis 115/206 (56) 127/154 (82) Pain and fever 28/174 (16) 2/199 (1) Bronchiolitis 4/7 (57) 0/8 (0) (2) 0/69 (0) Atopic eczema 2/3 (67) 0/4 (0) ENT infections 0/24 (0) 1/27 (4) Asthma 1/8 (13) 0/3 (0) Chapter 4: Clinically assessing the POPI UK criteria 122 These data demonstrate that the higher rate of identified potentially irrational prescribing in the inpatient population (excluding the vitamin category) does not correlate with higher numbers of patients with a relevant clinical indication. That is to say that there are patients present in the emergency department population with the same indications for prescribing in whom potentially irrational prescribing has not been detected. There are several possible explanations for this observation. The higher numbers of medicines prescribed in the inpatient population may have increased observed rates of PIMs. In addition, it may be that children in this group had greater morbidity, e.g. anti-emetics for nausea or vomiting may be considered clinically indicated for patients whose severity warrants admission, or inpatients may be more likely to have other causes for nausea and vomiting besides gastroenteritis, thereby justifying use of anti-emetics. Bronchiolitis was an area with a 57% rate of PIM compared with none in the ED group; again, more severe morbidity may account for patients having been prescribed antibiotics, for example, in case of an alternative diagnosis of bacterial infection. However, cases were only rated as PIMs if bacterial infection was not stated as a diagnosis, which may suggest these are cases of true inappropriate prescribing. 4.7.3 Usefulness of the POPI UK criteria in identifying potentially inappropriate prescribing This study demonstrated the POPI UK criteria were used to successfully identify a number of PIMs and PIOs in the study population. However, 242/282 of these related to the single vitamin criterion, with 39 other PIMs or PIOs identified. In addition, there were 30 cases where it was undeterminable whether or not a PIM or PIO had occurred. In most cases where a PIM or PIO could not be determined, this was due to the highly detailed nature of the POPI or paper prescribing nor in clinical notes. These included examples such as the presence or absence of a growth chart, the hydration status of the patient at the time of prescribing, or all examination features needed to calculate a Centor score in tonsillitis. In other cases, the issue was subjectivity of terms in the criteria sXch as \u00b4seYere\u00b5 and \u00b4disWress\u00b5, Zhich, if Chapter 4: Clinically assessing the POPI UK criteria 123 not explicitly documented by the prescribing clinician, could not readily be inferred by the POPI UK coder. These cases of indeterminate criteria highlighted that a comprehensive view of patient data is required to code patient data using the POPI UK criteria. In comparison, explicit criteria such as the STOPP/START criteria for geriatric medicine can be applied to more limited datasets such as prescribing databases with only coded diagnoses and prescriptions(169). This facilitates application of the criteria to potentially very large datasets, including previously acquired data and data matched to patient outcome measures, such as a 2015 population-based cohort study of older adults in Ontario using Beers and STOPP/START criteria(110). PIPc was also designed to be applicable to retrospective prescribing datasets, although there may be limitations in their application, as discussed in Section 2.5.4. The highly detailed criteria of the POPI UK tool are also likely to necessitate a clinically trained coder who is able to understand the specific clinical terminology of inclusions and exclusions described within criteria. Some criteria require good knowledge of technical langXage, e.g. \u00b4oWorrhoea\u00b5, and oWhers specific knoZledge or \u00b4red flag s\\mpWoms\u00b5 of deh\\draWion. The fact that indeterminate cases almost equalled identified PIMs and PIOs appears to highlight a significant limitation to the POPI UK tool. However, as discussed in 4.1.1, this is a limitation that may be expected in highly detailed implicit criteria, where the detail allows for more accurate results but makes scoring the tool more challenging. It may be expected that therefore the precision, or repeatability, of the POPI UK tool might be low, given the difficulty of coding using the POPI UK criteria as revealed in this study. 4.7.4 Comparison with published clinical evaluation of French POPI criteria There is one published validation study of the French POPI criteria, published as an abstract (129) and subsequently in the British Medical Journal Open (123). Similar to this clinical evaluation of the POPI UK criteria, the POPI criteria were evaluated in their usefulness to detect potential irrational prescribing, without directly Chapter 4: Clinically assessing the POPI UK criteria 124 studying association with adverse drug effects or patient outcomes. Unlike the evaluation of the POPI UK criteria, the French POPI criteria were conducted as retrospective analysis of prescription data. Patient data were drawn from two study populations: an emergency department and a community pharmacy. A total of 18,562 prescriptions for 15,973 patients in the emergency department and 4,780 prescriptions for 2,225 patients in the community pharmacy were analysed. One important difference in study protocol was that, despite the POPI criteria assessing for PIOs, their clinical validation study inclusion criteria mandated inclusion only of children who had been prescribed one or more medications. This is in contrast to the approach to the validation of the POPI UK tool, where participants were eligible even without any prescriptions, in order to enable greater capture of potentially inappropriate omissions. As the tools both assess for PIOs as well as PIMs, this may cause a falsely low rate of omissions being identified. In addition, in the original POPI study only primary diagnoses and their related prescriptions were evaluated, rather than all diagnoses and prescriptions (123). In the French POPI study, PIMs and PIOs were analysed separately. The rate of PIMs was 2.9% in the emergency department and 12.3% in the community pharmacy. PIOs were detected in 2.3% of prescriptions in the emergency department and 6.1% in the community pharmacy. In comparison, the UK POPI UK criteria study demonstrated overall rates of PIMs in 1% and PIOs in 16.4%, which falls to 1.5% excluding the criterion mandating Healthy Start vitamins. The close equivalent criterion in the original POPI criteria to the Healthy Start vitamin criterion in the POPI UK tool is a criterion advising a PIO of vitamin D supplementation. These are compared in Table 4-M. Chapter 4: Clinically assessing the POPI UK criteria 125 Table 4-M: Comparison of original POPI and POPI UK criteria relating to vitamins Original POPI criterion POPI UK criterion Insufficient intake of vitamin D. Minimum vitamin D intake: Breastfed baby = 1,000 to 1,200 IU/day; Infant, 18 months of age (milk enriched in vitamin D) = 600 to 800 IU/day; Child aged between 18 months and 5 years, and adolescents aged between 10 and 18 years: two quarterly loading doses of 80,000 to 100,000 IU/day in winter (adolescents can take this dose in one go) Healthy Start vitamins for infants and children 6 months- 5 years or having less than 500ml infant formula per day This criterion was excluded from analysis in both populations of the original POPI clinical study, meaning that the comparison between studies is more pertinent when excluding the vitamin criterion from the POPI UK study results. The categories with the most frequent potentially irrational prescribing in the study of the original POPI tool were in respiratory and digestive medicine, in contrast with the study of the POPI UK criteria, where vitamins and antibiotic prophylaxis and pain and fever were the most common categories of potentially irrational prescribing. This difference is likely due to the original POPI study only including three of the criteria related to pain and fever\u00b3in fact, only one was applied to the hospital population (a PIM relating to opiates used to treat migraine) and two in the community population (relating to dosage of ibuprofen and the combined use of two NSAIDs). The selective use of criteria in the study using the original POPI tool therefore limits the usefulness of direct comparisons. 4.7.5 Study population and risk of bias As stated in section 4.3.3, fluency in the English language was a mandatory inclusion criterion due to resource constraints. As demographic data around ethnicity was not collected, it is not possible to state to what extent the study population was representative of the catchment population of the Royal Derby Hospital. However, the three groups likely to have been excluded by this criterion- first- or second-generation immigrants, international travellers and children of parents with disability (e.g. native sign language users) \u00b2 are likely to have relevant characteristics that affect the results of the study. Chapter 4: Clinically assessing the POPI UK criteria 126 In terms of evaluating the applicability of the POPI UK criteria to a population, some heritable conditions are more prevalent in people of particular ethnic origins, for instance African or Caribbean origins in the case of sickle cell anaemia (of which no cases were identified in the study population). Other acquired conditions, such as malaria (not included in POPI UK), are likely to be acquired in endemic regions and may therefore be more common in international travellers or immigrant families with travel from such areas. In addition, all recruitment and data collection were conducted during the day. Although patients admitted overnight to the inpatient ward were likely to be captured, this will have excluded patients seen in the ED overnight. It is possible that certain conditions were over- or under-represented as a result, if they are more likely to present at night. Recruitment was undertaken between August and February and therefore captured both summer and winter populations. In future work using POPI UK, further evaluation of the applicability of the criteria to the full population would be valuable to ascertain whether the criteria are equally applicable without these limitations. 4.8 Conclusions 4.8.1 Strengths and limitations of the POPI UK criteria These results demonstrate that the POPI UK criteria have reasonably broad scope and are relevant to the majority of children presenting to the Emergency Department and admitted to the inpatient paediatric ward in this study. Even excluding the PIO related to vitamins, the criteria related to at least one condition seen in the majority patients in the population. The criteria were able to detect a number of potentially clinically significant inappropriate PIMs or PIOs that might have adverse effects on patients, such as omission of laxatives with over 48 hours of morphine administration (which may lead to constipation with both patient discomfort and the risk of secondary complications), PIMs of non-indicated therapies such as acid-suppressing medications, antibiotics, or inhaled \u00df2 Chapter 4: Clinically assessing the POPI UK criteria 127 agonists (which therefore carry the risk of adverse effects of therapy without likelihood of patient benefit). The findings also highlighted a number of prevalent symptoms and conditions that are not included within the POPI UK, including sepsis and viral-induced wheeze. As discussed in Section 4.7.1, these are areas where there is evidence suggesting that they may be valuable areas in which to study irrational prescribing. This study also exposed a significant weakness in the POPI UK criteria in that the degree of specificity in the criteria required access to very detailed patient information, which was not always available from written patient records even contemporaneously. This limitation would limit the ability to apply the POPI UK criteria to any retrospective dataset and even with contemporaneous data collection it was not possible to code all criteria for all patients, with 38 cases with indeterminate coding. This limitation would apply equally to the original POPI criteria, and the published evaluations of the original POPI criteria have not addressed this limitation. In addition, the complexity of the criteria makes them time-consuming to apply. In each case, daWa collecWion reqXired reYieZ of all of Whe paWienW\u00b7s clinical notes as well as their current and historic prescriptions since the time of admission in order to identify potential indications or contra-indications to medications, or clinical reasoning that might influence interpretation of criteria. Depending on the lengWh of Whe paWienW\u00b7s admission aW the time of data collection, this took up to 45 minutes per patient. Analysis with cross-reference to the POPI UK codes became quicker with experience using the tool and once experienced with the tool took approximately ten minutes per patient. 4.8.2 Further research needs identified This study highlighted several limitations in the clinical application of the POPI UK criteria. Several frequent clinical indications are not included within the tool, and as discussed some of the complex implicit criteria were challenging to apply to the data. The high degree of complexity and nuance in implicit criteria may increase their accuracy but compromise their precision. To test this hypothesis, and evaluate the precision of the POPI UK criteria, an inter-rater and intra-rater repeatability study was felt to be of great Chapter 4: Clinically assessing the POPI UK criteria 128 value. This study is detailed in Chapter 5. Other future work could address the clinical areas not covered by the POPI UK criteria, either by further modifying the tool or considering alternative approaches to evaluate rational prescribing in these areas.Chapter 5: Inter- and intra-rater repeatability study of the POPI UK criteria 129 5 Inter- and intra-rater repeatability study of the POPI UK criteria 5.1 Introduction 5.1.1 Repeatability studies As discussed in Section 1.4.2 and in more detail in Section 4.1, a WesW\u00b7s reliabiliW\\ can be described through two aspects: repeatability, which evaluates precision, and accuracy, which describes closeness to a true value. Repeatability studies evaluate the similarity of results between different observers, or by the same observer when the test is performed multiple times. A high degree of precision is therefore reflected in a high degree of agreement between observers (inter-rater variability) or between scores by the same observer (intra-rater variability). Repeatability studies do not provide any measure of the accuracy of a test. Supposing a true value is known, even if both raters gave incorrect answers, if their responses were in agreement then this would support a high level of repeatability. Cohen\u00b7s Kappa () coefficient is an index of inter-observer agreement in categorical data. Although there is no universally accepted value of Kappa that equates to an acceptable degree of agreement, by one widely used convention a Kappa of < 0.4 is considered poor, 0.4-0.7 fair to good, and > 0.7 excellent (170). 5.1.2 Repeatability studies of other rational prescribing tools Repeatability studies have often been used to evaluate the precision of rational prescribing tools, including the MAI (171), STOPP/START criteria (72), and ACOVE criteria (172). Precision is a valuable characteristic of a rational prescribing tool as it increases the likelihood that values obtained in different studies, settings, or simply by Chapter 5: Inter- and intra-rater repeatability study of the POPI UK criteria 130 different raters are comparable, and therefore enables the tool to be used to make valid comparisons. A 2013 review of the MAI provides a cross-section of different methodologies that have been used in eight separate repeatability studies of the MAI. These are summarised in Table 5-A, adapted from Hanlon et al, 2013 (171). Table 5-A: Methodology of inter-rater reliability studies of the MAI Reference Raters Number of patients Hanlon et al, 1992 (128) Physician and pharmacist; two pharmacists Intra-rater reliability also evaluated 10 Samsa et al, 1994 (173) Physician and pharmacist 10 Fitzgerald et al, 1997 (174) Two pharmacists 10 Kassam et al, 2003 (175) Two pharmacists 32 Bregnh\u00f8j et al, 2005 (176) Two clinical pharmacologists, a clinical pharmacologist and a pharmacist (in pairs) Intra-rater reliability also evaluated 30 Spinewine et al, 2006 (177) Physician and pharmacist 16 Stuijt et al, 2009 (178) Three pairs of pharmacists Intra-rater reliability also evaluated 15 Gallagher et al, 2011 (179) Two physicians 40 The original POPI tool has also been evaluated in terms of inter-rater reliability in a study published as a conference abstract (180). In this study, twenty cases from the prior clinical validation study of children treated in an emergency department were selected. This included cases with or without PIMs/PIOs, but all cases had some medicines prescribed.

Chapter 5: Inter- and intra-rater repeatability study of the POPI UK criteria 131 In the evaluation of the original POPI inter-rater reliability, the results were analysed separately for PIMs and PIOs, with Kappas of 0.8 and 0.71 respectively (180). Intra-rater reliability was not tested. 5.2 Aims The aims of this study were to measure the inter-rater and intra-rater reliability of the POPI UK tool. 5.3 Methods 5.3.1 Study design The methodology chosen was designed for similarity to other studies assessing the reliability of rational prescribing tools in order to allow comparisons. The majority of studies assessing the MAI used the methodology of two raters, with a range of patient numbers from ten to 40. For this study, two junior doctors from relevant specialties (emergency medicine and general practice) were selected as raters. This meant that each worked in roles with paediatric patients. The junior doctors had trained and worked in different locations and were both ST1 grade at the time of the study. Junior doctors were chosen as the POPI UK criteria contain technical language and are likely to require both clinical knowledge and familiarity with medical notes and terminology to apply. Furthermore, as junior doctors are often highly involved in audit and quality improvement work(181), junior doctors are a group that is likely to make use of the POPI UK criteria in future. Twenty cases were selected at random from the data collected for the clinical validation study of the POPI UK tool (see Chapter 4), with ten cases drawn from each clinical setting of a paediatric emergency department and a paediatric inpatient ward. These case data were transcribed to new Case Report Forms to match the form of data that users of the tool might be using to evaluate prescribing; these case report forms were anonymous and the only patient identity information provided was age and sex. Chapter 5: Inter- and intra-rater repeatability study of the POPI UK criteria 132 The cases were selected according to Participant Identification Numbers using a random number generator from 1-300 for ten cases and from 301-600 for ten cases, in order to select ten cases from each clinical setting. In order to ensure these cases were representative of the dataset as a whole and gave an opportunity for raters to apply a range of the POPI UK criteria, the rates of PIMs or PIOs in these cases was checked and was proportionate to the overall results of the dataset. This meant that there were some cases with no identified PIMs or PIOS, some cases with identified PIMs or PIOs, and some cases which had been rated as \u00b6XnknoZn\u00b7 dXe Wo sXbjecWiYiW\\ or insXfficienW information. The case information was supplied in the form of a completed Case Report Form (see Figure 4-2). Both raters were provided with the POPI UK criteria and given the opportunity to read through the criteria in advance. They were then provided with the twenty case details and asked to identify PIMs or PIOs as defined in the POPI UK criteria. The order of cases was randomised. After a two-week interval, the raters were asked to repeat the same exercise, again with randomised case order, in order to evaluate intra-rater reliability. 5.3.2 Characteristics of selected cases The twenty randomly selected cases are shown over page in Table 5-B. The average number of medications per patient in the group was 3.1, compared with 2.7 in the population of the POPI UK clinical study as a while. Thirteen (65%) of the group had no PIMs/PIOs detected in the original study, which is comparable to the 66% of the whole population in the original study with no possible PIMs/PIOs identified. The median age of the selected cases was 4 years 6 months, slightly older than the overall population, which had a median age of 3 years.

Table 5-D: Session one inter-rater reliability results Rater 2 Rater 1 Y N U Total Y 2 0 2 4 N 0 10 1 11 U 1 1 3 5 Total 3 11 6 20 Agreement 2 10 3 0.75 By Chance 0.03 0.3025 0.075 0.4075 Kappa 0.58 Chapter 5: Inter- and intra-rater repeatability study of the POPI UK criteria 136 In Table 5-D, instances of agreement are counted in the cells running diagonally from top left to bottom right, showing two instances where raters agreed there was a PIM/PIO present, ten where they agreed there was no PIM/PIO, and three where both raters were uncertain. The rates of counted agreement as compared to what would be expected by chance are Xsed Wo calcXlaWe Cohen\u00b7s Kappa by the formula: Cohen's Kappa = 1 Where Po is the observed agreement and Pe is the hypothetical probability of agreement by chance. Using the data from session one as a worked example, Po is calculated as the number of cases in agreement divided by the total number of cases, shown as the total in the agreement row, i.e. Po = 15 / 20 = 0.75 Pe is calculated as the probability that instances of yes, no, or uncertain were in agreement by chance. These are calculated individually and then summed. Again, using the data from session one: 'Yes' Pe = (4 / 20) x (3 / 20) = 0.03 'No' Pe = (11 / 20) x (11 / 20) = 0.3025 'Uncertain' Pe = (5 / 20) x (6 / 20) = 0.075 Total Pe = 0.4075 Therefore, Kappa can be calculated for the inter-rater reliability of session one as: = 1 = 0.75 0.40751 0.40750.58 The results for session two are shown in Table 5-E.

The responses WhaW highlighted the reason for uncertainty are shown over page in Table 5-H with the related POPI UK criterion, grouped into four categories of reasons for rater uncertainty. As Table 5-H shows, the free-text comments could be grouped into the categories: more information required; subjective criterion; undefined timing or duration of prescription, and; specialist knowledge required. These categories highlight the challenges that prevented raters being able to apply the POPI UK criteria to the clinical information and prescriptions provided to them.

In the criterion relating to pertussis vaccination, information was required about all adults accompanying the child in consultations. Two criteria were mentioned twice, relating to analgesia and antibiotics prescribing. In these cases, raters highlighted areas of subjectivity and the high level of details required specifying indications and intended timings of prescriptions. 5.6 Discussion 5.6.1 Reliability of the POPI UK criteria Both the inter-rater and intra-rater agreement in this study were > 0.4, being 0.44 and 0.57 respectively. In the review of reliability studies of the MAI by Hanlon et al, a Kappa of > 0.4 Zas considered \u00b4good\u00b5 reliabiliW\\ (171). Table 5-I shows the inter-rater and, where it was measured, intra-rater Kappa scores for the MAI in the eight studies they reviewed. Table 5-I: Kappa score for the inter-rater and, where it was measured, intra-rater reliability of the MAI in eight studies (171) Reference Raters Kappa Inter-rater Intra-rater Hanlon et al, 1992 (128) Physician and pharmacist; two pharmacists 0.83 0.59 0.92 Samsa et al, 1994 (173) Physician and pharmacist 0.74* Fitzgerald et al, 1997 (174) Two pharmacists 0.64 Kassam et al, 2003 (175) Two pharmacists 0.65 Bregnh\u00f8j et al, 2005 (176) Two clinical pharmacologists, a clinical pharmacologist and a pharmacist (in pairs) 0.50 0.71 Spinewine et al, 2006 (177) Physician and pharmacist 0.84 Stuijt et al, 2009 (178) Three pairs of pharmacists 0.47 0.84 Gallagher et al, 2011 (179) Two physicians > 0.85 *The intra-class correlation coefficient was calculated rather than Kappa in one study. Chapter 5: Inter- and intra-rater repeatability study of the POPI UK criteria 141 Like the POPI UK repeatability study, these results show higher intra-rater compared to inter-rater reliability. A higher intra-rater agreement may be expected, as a rater may have an individual interpretation of criteria, which they reliably apply, compared to a different interpretation by another rater. The MAI is an apposite comparator to the POPI UK because it also had three different outcomes or ratings, \u00b4A\u00b5 indicaWing appropriaWe, \u00b4B\u00b5 marginall\\ appropriaWe, and \u00b4C\u00b5 inappropriate (171). However, the MAI consists of only ten criteria, which makes it much simpler for raters to apply compared with the 80 criteria of POPI UK. This may account, at least in part, for the higher levels of reliability found in the studies of the MAI. 5.6.2 Comparison with the reliability of the original POPI tool The original POPI tool was reported to have inter-rater reliability of 0.8 (for PIMs) and 0.71 (for PIOs) (180). The study also reported a median time of use of 2 mins 45s per case and user satisfaction with the tool (82%). Given the very close similarity between the POPI UK and the original POPI criteria, it is not clear how this very fast rate of use was achieved compared with the time taken to apply the POPI UK (from 10 to 45 minutes) as discussed in 4.8.1, although this may be partly due to differences in methodology. It is not stated in the report of the inter-rater reliability study, however in the clinical validation study of the original POPI criteria from which the cases were selected, it was stated that only 82 of the POPI criteria were applied to the emergency department population. Furthermore, other criteria were only applied selectively, for instance only three of five criteria related to analgesia and antipyrexics were evaluated, and not all prescriptions of amoxicillin were assessed according to the relevant criterion (123). A selective approach to application of criteria would likely decrease the time taken to apply the criteria and would also be likely to increase the observed repeatability due to there being fewer opportunities for disagreement between raters. In addition, only primary diagnoses and their related prescriptions were evaluated in the original POPI study, as opposed to all prescriptions and documented indications in the POPI UK study. Furthermore, the clinical study of POPI UK showed greater complexity Chapter 5: Inter- and intra-rater repeatability study of the POPI UK criteria 142 in the inpatient group studied. While the original POPI was tested against an emergency department population only, the POPI UK was tested against both emergency and inpatient populations. This is supported by the measure of number of prescriptions evaluated. In total, 57 medication prescriptions were evaluated in the original POPI repeatability study, as compared with 62 in the POPI UK study (including three cases with no prescriptions, meaning some more complex cases with greater polypharmacy). The inter-rater reliability study of the original POPI tool also used different methodology to that of other rational prescribing tools discussed above. As the repeatability study for the original POPI tool was published after the POPI UK repeatability study was carried out, it was not possible to match methodologies for closer comparison. Developers of the original POPI tool rated twenty cases, and these ratings were used as a gold standard against which eleven other raters were individually compared. This is in contrast to the usual application of Cohen\u00b7s Kappa as a sWaWisWical jXdgemenWs are eqXall\\ Yalid (182). The reported reliability figures are therefore median values of eleven Kappa values comparing each rater against the gold standard answer, rather than comparing raters with one another. Inter-rater reliability for PIMs ranged between 0.61-0.96, while reliability for PIOs ranged between 0.41-1.0. There are a number of factors that could contribute to the POPI UK criteria scoring less highly for inter-rater reliability than the original POPI criteria. Firstly, it should be considered whether there is evidence that the modifications to the tool have reduced its reliability. Compared with the original tool. Forty-nine criteria are unchanged, 29 modified, four simplified into two, and 23 omitted altogether. As a result, over half (49/80) of the modified criteria are identical to the original tool. Of the criteria associaWed ZiWh raWers\u00b7 XncerWainW\\, in Table 5-J, five were associated with unchanged criteria, eight associated with criteria where modifications did not affect the cause for uncertainty (needing additional information related to severity, risk factors or people accompanying the child), and two associated with modifications that may have introduced cause for uncertainty due to subjectivity in the criterion. This is shown below in Table 5-J. Chapter 5: Inter- and intra-rater repeatability study of the POPI UK criteria 143 Table 5-J: POPI UK criteria associated with uncertainty in comparison to the original POPI criteria Related POPI UK criteria Comparison to original POPI criterion Expected impact on rater uncertainty Nausea, vomiting and gastroesophageal reflux (potentially inappropriate): The combined use of proton pump inhibitors and NSAIDs, for a short period of time, in patients without risk factors Unchanged Unchanged Bronchiolitis (potentially inappropriate): H1-antagonists, cough suppressants, mucolytic drugs, or ribavirin to treat bronchiolitis Unchanged Unchanged Pain and fever (potentially inappropriate): Prescription of a medication other than paracetamol as a first line treatment (except in the case of migraine) (x2) Unchanged Unchanged Pain and fever (omission): Failure to give an osmotic laxative to patients being treated with morphine for a period of more than 48 hours Unchanged Unchanged Bronchiolitis (omission): Palivizumab in high-risk cases, defined as: 1) children < 2 years with chronic lung disease on home oxygen or who have prolonged use of oxygen 2) infants < 6 months with left-to-right shunt haemodynamically significant congenital heart disease and/or pulmonary hypertension Modified from: Palivizumab in the following cases: (1) babies born both at less than 35 weeks of gestation and less than six months prior to the onset of a seasonal RSV epidemic; (2) children less than two years old who have received treatment Unchanged Chapter 5: Inter- and intra-rater repeatability study of the POPI UK criteria 144 children < 2 years with severe congenital immunodeficiency (x3) for bronchopulmonary dysplasia in the past six months; (3) children less than two years old suffering from congenital heart disease with hemodynamic abnormalities Cough (omission): Failure to propose a whooping cough vaccine for pregnant women.

An alternative explanation for the difference in agreement between this study and that of the original POPI tool is the different settings of patients. All cases used in the original POPI study were drawn from an emergency department population, whereas in this study, half were from the emergency department and half from an inpatient group. It is not possible to calculate whether agreement differed for the emergency department compared with inpatient group in this study due to the anonymisation and randomisation process. There are a number of ways in which these populations differ. In particular, the average number of prescriptions was much higher for inpatient cases (4.3 per patient) than emergency department cases (1.1 per patient) in the POPI UK clinical validation study (see Chapter 4), introducing a higher number of medications that need to be reviewed by the rater. By comparison the figures in the original POPI tool study were 1.1 prescriptions per patient in the emergency department setting and 2.1 in the community pharmacy setting. Their data excluded patients who had no prescriptions, as per their exclusion criteria. The higher number of prescriptions per patient in the inpatient setting of the POPI UK tool validation study as compared to any of the other settings tested may suggest a higher degree of complexity, which could contribute to less reliability between raters. In addition, in the report of the original POPI tool validation study, the detection of potentially irrational prescribing was measured as a binary outcome as compared with Chapter 5: Inter- and intra-rater repeatability study of the POPI UK criteria 146 three options in this study (Y/N/U). This would increase inter-rater agreement as measXred in complete agreement (Kappa=1) on cases where neither rater scored their response as Of have of 1 for inter-rater reliability of the POPI UK criteria if raters were asked to rate all responses Y/N, as the cases of uncertainty may have resulted in guessing and therefore introduced disagreement. However, even assuming entirely divergent guesses between raters or between sessions, this would have resulted in an increased Kappa value. Lastly, the methodology used in the study of the original POPI tool was to compare each rater back to a fixed gold standard result. It did not, therefore, directly compare raters who were unpractised with the tool against each other. It is possible that there was less disagreement between each rater and the gold standard results than there might have been between raters. It is therefore not possible to directly compare the results between the reliability testing of the original POPI criteria and the POPI UK criteria. 5.6.3 Limitations of the study Like several of the studies reviewed by Hanlon et al (171), this study evaluated inter-rater reliability between two similar raters (in this case, both junior doctors). Given the highly technical clinical information included in the POPI criteria, it may be that raters with different clinical backgrounds would show more disagreement while more experienced clinicians or pharmacists might show more agreement. The inclXsion of Whe coding of POPI UK tool. A more in-depth interview of users of the tool would provide more detail on which areas of the tool are challenging to use, whether due to subjectivity, technical knowledge requirements, or need for detailed information that may not be readily available in patient notes or retrospective datasets. Chapter 5: Inter- and intra-rater repeatability study of the POPI UK criteria 147 5.7 Conclusions This study demonstrated fair to good inter-rater and intra-rater reliability for the POPI UK tool, suggesting that it has comparable precision to other widely accepted rational prescribing tools such as the MAI for older adults. The relative complexity of the POPI UK criteria likely contributes to a lower precision than they might otherwise have, as well as meaning they are time-consuming to apply (15). Many of the criteria require technical knowledge such as good working knowledge of drug groups and symptomatology, and there are subjective areas in some criteria such as evaluating the severity of a sore throat. In addition, several criteria require detailed information to be available about the patient, such as co-morbidities or discussions that were had (\u00b4failXre Wo propose Zhooping coXgh\u00b5 does noW reqXire a prescripWion, per se, only a discussion). This level of detail is comparable between the original and POPI UK criteria. While these detailed criteria have some advantages in increasing the clinical validity of the tool in terms of aiming for truly rational prescribing, they also increase the difficulty of using the tool. For instance, while there are large prescribing datasets available such as GP practice prescribing data, these are unlikely to contain sufficient detail to evaluate against all of the POPI UK criteria. However, for prospectively collected data, the high level of detail in the criteria may increase their sensitivity and specificity for identifying genuinely irrational prescribing. Avenues for future research include a direct comparison between the original POPI tool and POPI UK using the same data and methodology or evaluation of inter-rater reliability of the POPI UK with raters from different clinical backgrounds and levels of experience. It would also be interesting and may inform further development of the POPI UK to re-test the criteria with the removal of all criteria that were rated as uncertain, to test the hypothesis that this would increase inter- and intra-rater reliability. If so, this could guide the development of a more reliable rational prescribing tool. Chapter 6: Conclusions 148 6 Conclusions 6.1 Introduction Rational prescribing by definition should achieve an optimum balance between the therapeutic benefits of prescribed medicines and minimal harms to individuals, communities, and healthcare systems in the form of adverse effects, medication resistance, and excess cost (12). Inappropriate prescribing has both economic and human costs (183). Prescribing for children is complicated by the need for individualised calculated dosing regimens and a dearth of high-quality evidence on which to base practice (5). Rational prescribing tools provide a means of studying quality of prescribing with a quantitative approach. These allow assessment by prescribers of their own prescribing, service-level evaluations of prescribing for quality improvement purposes, research into influences on decision-making in prescribing, and comparison between patterns of irrational prescribing across different clinical settings, regions, or times, or between groups of prescribers. Prior to this thesis, there was no rational prescribing tool for evaluating the quality of prescribing for children across a range of clinical settings in the UK. The work as described in this thesis has identified all available paediatric rational prescribing tools, developed a new rational prescribing tool that can be used to evaluate and compare quality of prescribing for children in any clinical setting within UK practice, and also provided evidence for the accuracy and precision of this tool. Chapter 6: Conclusions 149 6.2 Summary of findings 6.2.1 Systematic review of paediatric rational prescribing tools Chapter 2 reports a systematic review of medical, nursing and pharmaceutical literature for paediatric rational prescribing tools. The original search resulted in three publications all relating to a single rational prescribing tool, the POPI (Pediatrics: Omissions of Prescriptions and Inappropriate prescriptions) tool. This tool was developed using French, UK and USA guidelines relating to paediatric prescribing, using the Delphi consensus method. The tool is designed to address frequent paediatric pathology categories according to physiological systems, meaning that it can be applied in a wide range of clinical settings. An update of the systematic review in 2019 demonstrated a further paediatric rational prescribing tool that has been published since the systematic review was completed. This tool, the PIPc (Potentially Inappropriate Prescribing in children) is designed specifically for use in primary care settings in the UK (117). It comprises twelve indicators across four physiological categories. These were also designed by Delphi consensus and are intended to be used to evaluate prescribing where clinical data were unavailable, such as dispensing datasets. The updated search also identified the POPI UK. Analysis of the systematic review included exploring the characteristics of the rational prescribing tools that were found. A number of limitations were identified in both tools, including barriers to applying the criteria to the types of clinical data they were designed to assess. 6.2.2 Developing POPI UK The original POPI tool was developed using a combination of national guidelines from France, the UK, and the US. A number of criteria could not be readily applied to UK practice, due to references to medications outwith the British national formulary or criteria that were contradicted by UK clinical guidelines. In order to develop a tool applicable to paediatric practice across the UK, a study was undertaken to modify the original POPI criteria, with the aim of retaining as much as possible of the criteria Chapter 6: Conclusions 150 developed through the Delphi consensus method while ensuring that the criteria would provide a justified evaluation of rational prescribing in the context of UK paediatric practice. Overall, no change was made to 49 criteria. Twenty-nine criteria were modified to concord more closely with UK guidelines. Four criteria were condensed into two criteria due to being linked within single UK guidelines. Twenty-three were omitted due to the absence of relevant UK guidance or conflicting UK guidance. One category title was amended to concord with terminology in use in the UK. The novel POPI UK tool comprises 80 criteria that can be used to evaluate rational prescribing for children in UK practice. 6.2.3 Clinical evaluation of the POPI UK tool In order to evaluate the usefulness of the POPI UK tool, two studies were undertaken to assess its validity as a measure of rational prescribing. The first of these studies was an evaluation of the tool in terms of accuracy, by testing whether it was of appropriate scope and sensitivity to detect instances of potentially irrational prescribing in UK paediatric practice. Clinical and prescribing data on 598 paediatric cases were collected prospectively in WZo differenW children\u00b7s emergenc\\ deparWmenW inpatient ward. This study demonstrated that 96% of patients in the study population had at least one documented clinical symptom, sign, or diagnosis that falls within the scope of the POPI UK tool. Even excluding the highly prevalent vitamins criterion, relevant to 242 cases, the majority of patients (89%) had at least one relevant clinical indication, suggesting that the tool has broad enough scope to be used to evaluate prescriptions in both studied settings. Furthermore, 262 instances of potentially irrational prescribing were detected, suggesting that the criteria are relevant to UK paediatric practice in at least the two settings studied. The study also highlighted some drawbacks to the POPI UK criteria. In 38 prescriptions, it was not possible to determine whether or not prescribing was rational according to the Chapter 6: Conclusions 151 modified criteria due to subjectivity or a higher level of clinical information being required than was accessible even through prospective collection of data. The comparison of results of this study to the published use of the original POPI criteria showed that exclusion of patients with no medicines prescribed may have caused a falsely low rate of omissions detected in the French study, as well as raising concern about how criteria requiring highly detailed and sometimes non-clinical information were scored on retrospective data. Lack of discussion of these issues in reports about the original POPI criteria mean that its limitations may not have been fully illustrated in those studies. In addition, there were a number of common diagnoses in the POPI UK study population that are not included within the criteria, including viral-induced wheeze, sepsis, and soft tissue injuries. These may present future targets for subsequent modification of the tool or development of other tools aimed at detecting irrational prescribing. 6.2.4 Inter- and intra-rater reliability study of the POPI UK tool The second study to evaluate the POPI UK tool was a repeatability study to test its precision. An inter- and intra-rater reliability study measures the closeness of results when the test is applied to the same data either by two different raters or by the same rater at different times. Higher precision may increase the usefulness of the tool for use in both quality improvement and research. The study methodology was designed to be similar to the studies of precision of other rational prescribing tools to facilitate clearer interpretation of the results. The measured inter- and intra-rater repeatability of the POPI UK criteria were 0.44 and 0.57 respecWiYel\\. These correspond Wo \u00b4good\u00b5 reliabiliWy according to the classifications used for other rational prescribing tools (171) but were significantly lower than those reported for the original POPI criteria of 0.8 and 0.71 respectively. This is in spite of the fact that over half of the modified criteria are identical to the original tool and may relate to the differing study populations and study designs. The POPI UK tool was tested against both an emergency department population and inpatient population, whereas the original tool was only tested in emergency department patients. The clinical evaluation study of the Chapter 6: Conclusions 152 POPI UK tool, showed that the inpatient population had a much higher number of prescriptions per patient compared with the emergency department group, and may therefore present greater complexity to a rater. Chapter 6: Conclusions 153 6.3 Practical implications The POPI UK tool is a novel paediatric rational prescribing tool that has practical applications in a variety of areas. In all of these applications, the limitations of the tool in terms of its complexity, time-consuming nature, and the need for detailed patient information would be challenges that would need to be overcome to achieve the greatest benefit. This is considered in more detail in Section 7.5 Future research. 6.3.1 Research The tool can also be used to facilitate research into paediatric rational prescribing. This field has been described as an \u00b4eYidence based deserW\u00b5 (101) and the POPI UK criteria provide a means of quantitative and qualitative analysis that can be applied in a variety of settings. Rational prescribing tools have been used extensively in research in other fields, for insWance Beers\u00b7 criWeria haYe been Xsed Wo inYesWigaWe raWional prescribing for older adults in a variety of settings (67, 110, 184-186). The POPI UK tool could be used in a similar way to explore whether there is a difference in quality of prescribing for children in non-specialist settings such as undifferentiated emergency departments and general practice as compared to paediatric departments. It could also be used to investigate whether there are differences in prescribing between different groups of prescribers, including non-medical prescribers, and examine factors associated with better prescribing. Equally, the tool could be used to investigate the relationship between rational prescribing and patient outcomes, to identify the impact of higher and lower quality prescribing on patients. However, it is Whe aXWhor\u00b7s view that significant changes to the tool would greatly improve its usefulness and effectiveness, as discussed in Section 6.5. 6.3.2 Quality improvement As a measure of rational prescribing, the POPI UK criteria can be used in audit by or on behalf of prescribers to evaluate rational prescribing or guide targets for interventions to improve quality of prescribing. Chapter 6: Conclusions 154 Medical audits are systematic and quantitative assessments of clinical care that require a standard against which to compare contemporary practice (187), (188). Audits have been demonstrated to be an effective component of prescribing education for both medical and non-medical prescribers (189) and a prescribing audit has recently become a mandatory component of general practitioner training in the UK. In a pilot of this scheme, positive feedback from trainees on the impact upon their practice included qXoWaWions sXch as, \u00b4An e[cellenW a baWch enabled Whemes Wo appear\u00b5 (190). More broadly within medicine, audits have been found in a Cochrane review of evidence to have moderate evidence for improvement in adherence of practitioners with desired standards, and are more effective when clear targets are set out for health professionals(191). The evidence for improvement in patient outcomes was weaker but remained favourable. Rational prescribing also accommodates system-level considerations of high-quality prescribing such as cost-effectiveness and community impact. One of of is WhaW \u00b4PaWienWs receiYe medicaWions appropriaWe Wo Wheir clinical needs, in doses that meet their own individual requirements, for an adequate period of Wime, and aW Whe loZesW cosW Wo Whem and Wheir commXniW\\\u00b5 (42). Using prescribing indicators and audit to guide interventions has been a successful strategy not only in decreasing the rate of antibiotic use, and thus expenditure on antibiotics, but this reduction in use has been associated with decreased antibiotic resistance(192), which would have substantial beneficial ramifications for the wider community. POPI UK have the advantage of being designed to be applicable to paediatric practice whether in hospital or primary care and could be used in such settings as an audit tool to evaluate rational prescribing or to test quality of prescribing before and after interventions. In the case of applying POPI UK for the purposes of an audit, where a target or gold standard rate of compliance may be set against which to compare data, users of the tool should consider that detection of potentially irrational prescribing by a tool does not Chapter 6: Conclusions 155 Where is no poor prescribing occurring. All that is being tested is adherence to the specific criteria in the tool. In this context, the tool can be used to identify patterns or types of potentially irrational prescribing and provide an opportunity for reflection and consideration of factors contributing to what is detected, as well as to measure rates before and after an intervention. It is often the case that the standard set in an audit, aiming for 100% compliance, may have good clinical reasons for deviation and less than 100% is identified both before and after an intervention. This does not necessarily reduce the usefulness of the exercise. The appropriate target compliance level may vary from criterion to criterion. The case of contraception for women of child-bearing potential on isotretinoin would seem to be a case for 100% compliance, bXW Whe Pregnanc\\ PreYenWion programme does \u00b4alloZ\u00b5 for the exclusion of women who are not sexually active, which could mean incorrect assessment of a potentially inappropriate omission were such a case audited. In the case of antibiotic prophylaxis for children with sickle cell anaemia, the criteria do accommodate penicillin allergy with the alternative of erythromycin, but of course allergy to both is possible and would mandate deviation. However, the same provisos are true of many targets set in audits (i.e. there may be a reason beneficial to the patient for non-adherence to other targets). So long as audits are used to study a phenomenon, and not as a tool to judge or punish a department or group, 100% compliance could certainly be used as a target, accepting that no measure is perfect. The setting of this standard may well depend on settings and factors like how much clinical information they will be able to gather about the patient and would be for the individual or organisation undertaking the audit to consider. Chapter 6: Conclusions 156 6.3.3 Education Rational prescribing tools can also be used in medical education. Prescription audit has been demonstrated to improve prescribing skills in medical students(193). Other rational prescribing Wools, criWeria and STOPP (Screening Tool of Older Persons\u00b7 Potentially Inappropriate Prescriptions) criteria, have been used as educational tools (194, 195). In a single-blind study using rational prescribing tools to teach medical students about age-related pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and how to elicit the goals of drug treatment, student feedback was positive and students in the intervention group using the tools were able to identify significantly more potentially inappropriate medicines than those in the control group(194). As the POPI UK criteria cover many categories of irrational prescribing, including overprescribing, underprescribing and different types of misprescribing, in an educational setting the criteria could be used to identify if there were particular types of irrational prescribing that were more prevalent. This could guide further education into rational decision-making around prescribing. 6.3.4 Reflection on impact upon my own practice This section is the personal reflection of the author on the impact of this work on her own clinical practice. While undertaking the research contained within this thesis, I have continued clinical practice as a General Practice Specialist Trainee in settings with paediatric prescribing, including emergency departments, inpatient wards, and in general practice. The primary purpose of this work was not personal clinical development, however the value of the work to my own practice has been significant. The principles of rational prescribing are essential to the principles of good medical practice and engagement in this research strengthened my understanding of the practical applications of rational prescribing to practice. The General Medical Council ethical guidance to doctors in \u00b4Good medical pracWice: eYidence\u00b5(196). Chapter 6: Conclusions 157 I have learnt a great deal through studying rational prescribing for children in so much depth, and have been aware of both in terms of prescribing practices directly applicable to my clinical work and more subtle transformation of my attitude and approach to prescribing. Examples of specific learning points have been an increased awareness of the guidelines reflected in the POPI UK criteria, such as the recommendation for vitamin supplementation for children, the need to advocate for whooping cough vaccination to pregnant women, the importance of oral rehydration therapy for diarrhoea and vomiting, and the reminder to think of analgesia when prescribing antibiotics for ear infections. The subtler but perhaps more meaningful change I have taken from my work has been in eYalXaWing Whe YalXe WreaWmenW being effecWiYe for a giYen condition is only one part of that treatment being rational. Other aspects, such as wider system and societal considerations around cost effectiveness and drug resistance, are essential in general practice, where 300 million consultations take place every year, compared to 23 million ED attendances (197). The importance of high-quality prescribing has been recognised by the Royal College of General Practitioners, who have introduced a mandatory prescribing assessment to the training of GPs. I was in a cohort completing the first mandatory prescribing assessment, which highlights many of the principles of rational prescribing by asking trainees to reflect on the quality of a randomly collected sample of their prescriptions not only according to the right choice of drug, but dosage, duration, instructions, follow-up, documentation, and review. In both my personal reflection and detailed discussion with my clinical supervisor, my prescribing for paediatric patients was highlighted as very good; I believe this is in a large part due to the amount of thought and research I have been involved in in this area of practice. In addition, the academic collaboration with paediatric research nurses, paediatric clinical pharmacologists, and paediatric pharmacists has given me access to a wealth of paediatric pharmacological expertise, which has fostered my development in this area. By seeking to disseminate my research to a broader audience, I have benefited from the process of peer review of my publications and have also been fortunate to present the work to two Chapter 6: Conclusions 158 different audiences in the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, which has helped me to better articulate my research findings and their relevance to clinical practice, provided further critical analysis of the results, and led me to ask more questions of my work. 6.4 Strengths, challenges and limitations This thesis has a number of strengths. The systematic literature review demonstrated a relative paucity of rational prescribing tools for use in paediatric practice and identified two paediatric rational prescribing tools, PIPc, which was developed for application to primary care settings and POPI, designed to be used in any paediatric setting but founded in French clinical guidelines. The POPI UK criteria comprise a tool using up-to-date British clinical guidelines, and the subsequent validation studies demonstrated relevance to UK paediatric practice, the ability to detect potentially irrational prescribing using the tool, and a good degree of repeatability. These new findings have direct applicability to both clinical and academic medicine as discussed in 6.3. Practical Implications. The clinical validation study protocol was modelled on WHO recommendations of rational prescribing studies (54). Data were gathered from two different areas of paediatric practice, taking in a range of prescribers including GP trainees, paediatric trainees, nurse practitioners, and consultant paediatricians. The protocol for the repeatability study was modelled after similar studies that have been used to evaluate rational prescribing tools for older adults, facilitating direct comparison of results and providing a foundation for future in-depth research. A limitation of this work was the development of the UK tool through modification of the French POPI criteria. As discussed in Sections 1.4 and 3.1, rational prescribing tools have often been developed through Delphi consensus method, with other examples of tools being updated, as in this work, for application of criteria developed in one country to be used in another. Chapter 6: Conclusions 159 As the original POPI criteria were selected through French prevalence data, it is possible that the criteria may be of less relevance to UK practice. On the other hand, British guidelines were applied to the development of the original tool and 49 of the 80 criteria comprising POPI UK are unchanged from the original criteria. This shows a significant degree of agreement in practice. Only 22 of the 105 POPI criteria were omitted due to absence of evidence in UK guidelines which, as discussed in Section 3.4.2,, does not necessarily reflect irrelevance to UK practice. Ultimately, the clinical study of POPI UK demonstrated a high degree of relevance of the criteria to UK clinical practice, but with some areas of potentially valuable study excluded, such as viral-induced wheeze and sepsis. Further study of the applicability of POPI UK in community settings, including general practice, is needed It is unlikely a single rational prescribing tool would have the scope to apply to all areas of interest and is probable that there will always be value in having several different tools available to study rational prescribing in children in the UK, as is now the case with both PIPc and POPI UK. A second limitation of the thesis is limited direct comparison to the studies that have been undertaken for the original POPI tool, which were published after completion of the studies of POPI UK. Resource and time constraints applied limitations to study design. For instance, screening for the systematic review was by a single researcher for title and abstract, with a second reviewer only included for full-text screening due to such constraints and the high number of articles eligible for screening. An area where this limitation had particular impact is the fact that all data were gathered from a single hospital, and therefore there may be some factors affecting patient populations or prescribing practices that are not more broadly generalisable, or missed factors which relate to prescribing in other settings such as primary care. Further research using the POPI UK POPI criteria would be valuable not only to study differences in rational prescribing in different settings across the UK, but also to further validate the use of the tool in a wider variety of settings. Chapter 6: Conclusions 160 Similarly, the fact that the large majority of data were collected by a single researcher may have affected evaluation of the tool. As a result of this, as both developer of the tool and rater of the findings, the author was extremely familiar with the POPI UK criteria throughout the process. This is somewhat mitigated by the inclusion of two different raters for the repeatability study, however it would be beneficial to evaluate whether there were unidentified obstacles to other prescribers or researchers making use of the tool, particularly non-medical prescribers given the high degree of clinical detail contained within the tool. One challenge that was identified early in the research process was designing patient information leaflets for the study that were accessible to parents and children. As discussed in Chapter 1, the additional complexity of informed family decision-making is one of the perceived barriers to research involving children (87). In fact, it is important to develop information resources accessible to both children and adults of varying literacy levels and cognitive ability (92). However, ethical and legal issues mean that institutions may have mandatory language that must be included in participant information materials, which sometimes necessitates inclusion of technical language that reduces the readability of content. As discussed in Chapter 2, in the case of designing participant information material for Whis sWXd\\ process to maximise their accessibility and usefulness. Following review by University governance, it was necessary to include certain mandatory text, which provided additional and important information to participants but unfortunately increased the reading age grade of the documents. This was partly overcome by agreement that mandatory text must be available to all participants in the parent/carer information sheets and for participants aged over 16 who could give consent, in the 16-18 years information sheets, but did not need to be included in age-specific leaflets for younger ages, which were aimed at communicating with younger people in the study in order to facilitate informed assent. Further small amendments were made following review by the ethics committee, some of which included simplification of language. This demonstrates the challenge in developing research literature that is accessible to a large majority of stakeholders while also having sufficient detail and clarity to Chapter 6: Conclusions 161 communicate information about the research and provide the foundation for truly informed consent. This is not an issue unique to paediatric research, but developing literature that is explicitly aimed at a range of ages brought the issue into greater visibility. One essential and effective resolution of this issue is ensuring that researchers provide time for full discussion of all information that is provided in writing. Not only does this provide participants with an important opportunity to ask questions, this also gives the researcher an opportunity to ensure that the information has been understood before seeking consent. This was a key part of the protocol for obtaining informed consent for the clinical validation study for the POPI UK criteria. 6.5 Future research There are a number of avenues that invite further research building upon the work of this thesis. Despite its limitations, as discussed in section 6.3 there are a number of research applications for the POPI UK criteria. The tool could be used to investigate independent factors associated with higher quality rational prescribing for children and to test interventions designed to improve quality of prescribing. It could further be used in research investigating to what extent irrational prescribing is associated with poorer patient outcomes, and whether there are particular settings or types of irrational prescribing where the impact may be more harmful. It would be useful to directly compare the existing tools evaluating the same prescribing data with unmodified original POPI criteria, the PIPc, and the POPI UK criteria to explore whether the tools have different sensitivities for detecting different categories or types of irrational prescribing. It would also be useful to compare the inter- and intra-rater reliability of the tools within a controlled setting where similar patient data and raters were used. However, this work has shown that while there are extant paediatric rational prescribing tools, and one product of this work is a tool that can be used in any paediatric practice setting in the UK, the limitations and complexities of the existing tools currently reduce Chapter 6: Conclusions 162 their effectiveness. It is recommended that the criterion related to ibuprofen prescribing be modified to more accurately reflect UK guidelines, which recommend three to four times daily prescribing. To advance the study of paediatric rational prescribing, further modification of the POPI UK tool could be undertaken to reduce its complexity. Options that might increase its reliability and reduce the time taken to apply the criteria would include: significantly reducing the number of criteria; removing all subjective criteria, and; targeting areas of prescribing that are highly prevalent and likely to be detected in most areas of practice, such as management of fever and pain, nausea and vomiting, and respiratory tract infections. For example, the POPI UK criteria could be modified into a short paediatric prescribing tool of a similar size to the WHO prescribing indicators or the MAI, between five to ten criteria. Preferably, selected criteria would be explicit, in order to be readily applicable to varied sources of data. This would ideally be guided by a Delphi consensus method involving experts from a variety of paediatric practice settings including general, emergency, and community paediatrics as well as general practice, and involving both physicians and pharmacists. Further work would then also be required to validate such a tool. Regardless of which tool is considered, whether the POPI UK in its current form or another modified or novel tool, rational prescribing tools require regular updating to maintain currency against evidence and prevalent practices. This process can be seen through the stepwise updates of the Beers criteria over time (63, 65, 66). This would therefore be an important element of future work involving POPI UK. 6.6 Final conclusions This thesis has identified the absence of a rational prescribing tool for the evaluation of paediatric rational prescribing in non-general practice settings in the UK, and the research herein: i) reports the development of a novel paediatric rational prescribing tool, POPI UK, for use in a range of UK paediatric settings; ii) demonstrates clinical relevance, real-world detection of irrational prescribing by the POPI UK; iii) demonstrates the POPI UK has an acceptable level of reliability, and; iii) presents the POPI UK criteria as a Chapter 6: References 163 rational prescribing tool for future application to educational, clinical governance, and research purposes, and for further development.

Paediatric rational prescribing hasnot been as widely investigated. The aims of this review were to identify and provide an overviewof all paediatric rational prescribing tools that have been developed for use in paediatric settings.A systematicliterature search was made of MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and IPA from their earliestrecords until July 2019 for all published paediatric rational prescribing tools. The characteristicsof the tools were recorded including method of development, types of criteria, aspects of rationalprescribing assessed, and intended practice setting. The search identied three paediatric rationalprescribing tools: the POPI (Pediatrics: Omissions of Prescriptions and Inappropriate Prescriptions)tool,the modiedPOPI (UK) tool, and indicators of potentially inappropriate prescribing in children(PIPc). PIPc comprises explicit criteria, whereas POPI and the modied POPI (UK) use a mixedapproach. PIPc is designed for use in primary care in the UK and Ireland, POPI is designed for use inall paediatric practice settings and is based on French practice standards, and the modied POPI(UK) is based on UK practice standards and is designed for use in all paediatric practice settings.This reviewdescribes three paediatric rational prescribing tools and details their characteristics.This willprovide readers with information for the use of the tools in quality improvement or researchand support further work in the eld of paediatric rational prescribing.Keywords:rational prescribing; paediatrics; rational use of medicines1. IntroductionRational prescribing has dened by the World Health Organisation as \"when patientsreceive the appropriate medicines, in doses that meet their own individual requirements, for anadequate period of time, and at the lowest cost both to them and the community\" [1]. It has beenpoorly studied in paediatric patients; a eld that has been described as \"an evidence based desert\" [2].Irrational prescribinghas wide-ranging impacts, from adverse drug reactions and progression ofinappropriately managed disease to additional system healthcare costs and antimicrobial resistance.The use of criteria lists as tools to quantify rational prescribing in adult medicine is well established [3].There are a number of potential benets to rational prescribing tools; assessment tools enablequantication of the quality of prescribing, which facilitates research into interventions aiming toimprove prescribing and allows prescribing in dierent settings to be compared. This facilitates deeperresearch into root causes of problematic prescribing Environ. Res. Public Health2020,17, 1473 2 of 13A 2014 systematic review of rational prescribing tools for adults by Kaufmann et al. identied46 publishedtools [4]. Of these, 22% did not have a stated target population, while 78% werespecically targeted to prescribing for older adults. Older adults have been identied as a groupvulnerable to irrational prescribing due to a variety of factors, including the frequent existence ofco-morbidities, polypharmacy, care taking place in a number of dierent settings, and the eect ofageing on the selection of appropriate medications [5]. Many similar challenges exist in paediatricmedicine,with well-recogniseddevelopmental changes in physiology and metabolism having asignicant impact on pharmacokinetics in children of dierent ages [6]. In addition, children mayreceive medications in a number of dierent settings, including general practice, undierentiatedemergency departments, walk-in centres, paediatric wards in district general hospitals, and specialistpaediatric hospital settings. This means that prescribers with varied levels of paediatric experienceand expertise may be responsible for prescribing.Kaufmann et al. explicitly excluded tools targeted to children in their 2014 review. The aimof this review was to carry out a systematic review of paediatric rational prescribing tools in orderto produce a comprehensive overview of current tools available to measure rational prescribing inchildren. This will hopefully facilitate others studying this area.2. MethodsThe systematic literature search was designed to identify articles describing tools to assess rational(or inappropriate) prescribing for children.Inclusion criteria were: articles describing tools targeted at evaluating the rationality orappropriateness of prescriptions for children (aged less than or equal to 18 years), updated andrevised versions of previously published tools, and including tools limited to specic drugs, druggroups, diseases or disease groups.Exclusion criteria were: tools targeting adults, tools without specied target patient groups,indicators that assess rates or percentages of prescription types in a population, articles describinga validation study of a previously published tool, educational interventions aimed at improvingprescribing, and guidelines describing recommended prescribing.Search StrategyThe search was conducted in four databases in order to attempt to capture relevant medical, nursingand pharmaceutical research. These were: Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, International PharmaceuticalAbstracts (IPA) and CINAHL. Databases were searched from their earliest records possible until thestart of July 2019.Search terms to capture studies including children were derived from the recommended searchstrategy described by Kastner et al. 2006 [7], as these have demonstrated high sensitivity. The MeSHterm \"inappropriate prescribing\" was introduced in 2011, and was previously incorporated in thebroad term \"Drug therapy\". Search terms for rational prescribing were derived from the systematicreview of adult rational prescribing tools by Kaufmann et al. 2014 [4]. The combined terms were:(inappropriate prescribing or suboptimal prescribing or inappropriate medication or inappropriatepractices or drug prescriptions or Medication Appropriateness Index) and (child* or children* orp*ediatric* or infant* or adolescent*).All potentially relevant publications were screened by title and abstract and articles that met theexclusion criteria were excluded. The remaining articles were retrieved in full. Full-texts were examinedby FC and a second researcher who performed independent full-text screening, independently assessingarticles according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. After this process, any articles withoutconsensus were resolved by discussion and mutual agreement. A manual search of the bibliographiesof included texts was completed.Included articles were analysed by FC to extract the development process and characteristics ofthe rational prescribing tool. 168 Int.

ResultsThe search produced 2142 potentially relevant publications. 234 duplicated articles were removed.1908 articles were screened by title and abstract and 1736 were excluded (Figure1). One hundredseventy-two articles were selected for full-text review by two reviewers of which 163 were excluded.The excluded articles screened at full-text did not meet the inclusion criterion of describing rationalprescribing tools. Four full-texts were unavailable online from University library resources, and fromthe British Library. In the case of the four full-texts that were unavailable the abstracts suggestedthat these articles would not meet the inclusion criteria, although this could not be determined withcertainty. Five articles met the inclusion criteria. Bibliography mining of the included articles did notidentify any further relevant articles.Int. J. Environ. Res.

Rational Prescribing Tools IdentiedIn total, ve relevant were identied, relating to three paediatric rational prescribing tools.These are shown in Table1. 169 Int. Environ. Res. Public Health2020,17, 1473 UK PIPc 12Three relevant were relating to a single tool: POPI (Pediatrics: Omissions ofPrescriptions and Inappropriate Prescriptions) tool [9-11]. All three included articles are very similar,two in French and one in English, and describe the process of developing the POPI tool. The earliest,from 2011, is a letter describing the tool, giving nine examples of the gastro-intestinal criteria. The 2014and 2016 articles are English and French language, respectively. They report the consensus validation ofthe tool and give full details of the criteria. The number of criteria listed diers due to the combinationof several criteria together in the latter publication. Note that the 2014 article states there are 104 criteriabut lists 105. For the purposes of clarity, from this point reference to the POPI criteria is specically tothe wording and numbering in the English 2014 publication unless otherwise stated.The other two relevant articles relate to two additional rational prescribing tools. One of thesedescribes the modied (UK) POPI tool [12], a modication of the above POPI tool for application touse in the UK published by the authors of this review in 2017. The other relates to the development ofa rational prescribing tool for the evaluation of paediatric prescribing in primary care, indicators ofpotentially inappropriate prescribing in children (PIPc) [13]. This was developed in Ireland and theUK and published in September 2016.3.2. Characteristics of the Identied Paediatric Rational Prescribing ToolsAll three tools are examples of explicit or mixed rational prescribing tools and are comprised ofa number of explicit criteria dening potentially inappropriate prescriptions (PIPs) and potentiallyinappropriate omissions (PIOs). Both POPI and the (UK) also contain some criteriawith implicit features.The POPI tool comprises 105 criteria (80 PIPs and 25 PIOs) categorised by the authors according tobroadly grouped clinical conditions: diverse illnesses, digestive problems, ENT-pulmonary problems,dermatological problems, and neuropsychiatric disorders. The groups are further subdividedinto particular symptoms or conditions. The criteria cover a range of aspects of inappropriateprescribing, including overprescribing, underprescribing, and almost all areas of misprescribing exceptdrug-food interactions.The modied (UK) POPI tool comprises 80 criteria under the same categories as the original POPItool, except for the removal of one subcategory (Mosquitos [sic]). The criteria include 60 PIPs and20 PIOs across the same aspects of inappropriate prescribing as the original POPI criteria. 170 Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health2020,17, 1473 5 of 13PIPc comprises twelve criteria of potentially inappropriate prescribing or omissions, categorisedaccording to four physiological systems: respiratory, overprescribing misprescribing practices, ve relateto PIOs.The characteristics of the identied tools are summarised in Table2, where bullet points identifyaspects of irrational prescribing that are covered by each tool.3.3. Development of the Popi ToolThe methodology used to develop the POPI tool was designed to closely match the developmentof the STOPP/START criteria, according to the authors [10]. The STOPP/START criteria are criteriafor rational prescribing in older people developed in 2008 [14] comprising two lists; the \"STOPP\"list of PIPs, and the \"START\" list of PIOs. In the STOPP/START tool, the authors structured theircriteria according to physiological systems to mirror the usual organisation of drug formularies.The propositions were validated using an 18-member panel Delphi consensus where agreement wasdetermined by the kappa-statistic for agreement and participants were able to suggest additionalcriteria if desired [15].The POPI tool was developed in part by the Delphi consensus method. Prior to the Delphiconsensus process, the authors compiled a list of possible propositions.The authors structured POPI around 100 propositions classied according to biological systemsand divided into omissions and inappropriate prescriptions. The number of propositions was chosenas \"a good compromise between the number of major biological system to explore, the number of itemsin the geriatric lists and the maximum number of items compatible with a tool easy use\"[8] (p. 2).The authors then compiled a list of health problems frequently encountered in paediatric practice,according to frequency in the general population (source not specied), prevalence (derived from datafrom the French National Insurance Fund for Employers for long term conditions), and frequency ascause for hospitalisation (per French hospital medico-administrative records). The authors identiedhealth problems from this list, referred to as \"themes\", that would either require drug intervention orwhere pharmacological intervention would be considered inappropriate.For each selected theme, the authors conducted a literature search to identify recommendationson management. There was a requirement for recommendations to be evidence-based but the authorsdid not specify the level of evidence. Only recommendations published after 2000 were accepted andthese were then weighted by date of publication. Accepted sources of recommendations were theFrench Health Products Safety Agency (Agence Fran\u00e7aise de S\u00e9curit\u00e9Sanitaire des Produits de Sant\u00e9),the French National Authority Health Autorit\u00e9de Sant\u00e9Fran\u00e7aise), the French Societyfor Paediatricians (Soci\u00e9t\u00e8Fran\u00e7aise de P\u00e9diatrie), the American Academy of Pediatrics (NationalGuideline Clearing House), and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Evidence (NICE)Cochrane Library [sic]. They also used the MEDLINE database to search for examples of medicationerror and inappropriate prescription (search strategy unpublished).The propositions were then validated by a two-round Delphi consensus. Sixteen experts, includingpharmacists and paediatricians, were included, of whom ten responded to both rounds. The process ofrecruitment of experts is not described, only that most pharmacists were members of the French Societyof Clinical Pharmacy and most paediatricians were members of the French Society of Pediatricians. 171 Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health2020,17, Environ. Res. Public Health2020,17, 1473 7 of 13Initially, 108 propositions were presented to the experts. There is inconsistency between the2014 (English) compared with the 2016 (French) publication in that the 2014 paper states 104 criteriawere validated, whereas the 2016 paper states 101 criteria were validated. Furthermore, while it isstated in the 2014 paper that 104 propositions were validated, in fact 105 propositions are includedin their nal list. The dierence between the two papers is due to three instances of combining twostatements into a single criterion, and the omission of one proposition in the 2016 (French) publication.Specically, two propositions about desmopressin for nocturnal enuresis are combined into one andsix propositions about atopic eczema are combined into four. A proposition about benzyl benzoate forscabies is omitted. Other than this, the described process and criteria are the same.Two propositions were removed following the consensus study due to new contraindicationshaving been published for the use of these drugs in children, therefore 102 propositions were ultimatelyvalidated. In the 2016 French language publication describing the consensus validation of the POPItool [11], the authors state that 101 of 108 criteria were validated. For the purposes of evaluation anddiscussion below, the English language published list of 105 validated propositions in the 2011 reportis used.3.4. Development of the Modied Popi UK) ToolThe modied POPI (UK) tool was developed in order to apply the POPI tool, which was based ona mixture of French, UK, and US guidelines, to UK practice [12]. A number of medications identiedin the original POPI criteria are either not in usual use or unavailable in the UK, while some criteriadirectly conflicted with national UK clinical guidelines.Each of the 105 criteria in the English language publication of the POPI tool were compared torelevant UK clinical guidelines from NICE, the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network (SIGN), andthe British National Formulary for Children (BNFc). In cases where there were no relevant guidelines ordirectly contradictory guidelines, criteria were removed. If guidelines diered, criteria were modiedto reflect UK guidelines.In comparison to the original criteria, 49 criteria were not changed. 29 were modied to meet UKguidelines, four criteria were combined into two, and 23 were omitted altogether. Omitted criteriaincluded the removal of the clinical category of \"Mosquitos\", which comprised seven criteria.3.5. Development of the PIPcLike the POPI tool, the PIPc was developed by a two-round Delphi consensus method.Initial propositionswere selected via a systematic literature search for previously developed indicatorsfor paediatric prescribing.Inclusion criteria were:Describe prescribing that is hazardous or known to be ineectiveDescribe prescribing in keeping with best practice/current guidelinesApply to the population of children<16 yearsExclusion criteria were:Medications unavailable in the study settingCriteria that could not be applied in the absence of clinical informationCriteria containing medications with a low prevalence of useA steering group of academic and clinical general practitioners (GPs), academic and clinicalpharmacists, a pharmacoepidemiologist/statistician, and a postdoctoral researcher, assessed eachcriterion. Those that were not felt to meet the above conditions were excluded. In some cases, criteriawere modied to meet the need to be applicable without access to clinical information, for examplewhen evaluating data from a dispensing database. 173 Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health2020,17, 1473 8 of 13The panel for the Delphi consensus comprised eighteen specialists, nine from the Republic ofIreland (three GPs, three paediatricians, and three pharmacists) and nine from the UK (three GPs, threepaediatricians, and three pharmacists).The two-round Delphi consensus resulted in twelve criteria being accepted into the nal PIPc.3.6. Characteristics of the ToolsThe use of the POPI tool is not specically limited to any particular clinical setting. The propositionswere selected from paediatric health problems in the general population and as causes for hospitalisation,suggesting the tool would be relevant to both primary and secondary care. However, no primarycare specialists or general practitioners were involved in the development of the tool. The paediatricpopulation is not explicitly dened by the authors but some propositions are age-specic, for instancepharmacological treatment for attention decit disorder is described as inappropriate \"before age six(before school)\" [8] (p. 7) and topical 0.1% tacrolimus is inappropriate for atopic eczema\"before 16 years of age\" [8] (p. 6).The criteria of the POPI tool cover a wide range of the aspects of rational prescribing, includingall three specically identied in the tool as omissions. The inappropriate prescription propositions includesome examples of overprescribing and misprescribing.The modied POPI (UK) tool shares the characteristics of the original POPI tool.The PIPc is a tool that has been designed specically for application in primary care settings.Unlike the POPI tool, it has been developed to be applicable without access to clinical information,meaning that it can be used to evaluate data from large previously collected prescribing databaseswhere clinical information is often either omitted or concealed.The authors of the PIPc dene their paediatric population as children under 16 years of age.The age at which young people transition from paediatric to adult healthcare services can varydepending on health needs, social circumstances such as attendance in full-time education, andavailability of specialist services [16]. In addition to the population specied for the tool, some criteriafurther specify particular age ranges, for example, \"Loperamide should not be prescribed to childrenunder 4 years\" [11] (p. 8).The PIPc criteria describe almost as broad a range of types of potentially irrational prescribing asPOPI despite having far fewer criteria. The only aspects of irrational prescribing not contained withinthe PIPc that are covered by POPI misprescribing of dosage, duration, and duplication.3.7. Validation studiesThe POPI tool has been evaluated in both a clinical validation [17] and repeatability study [18](Table3). The very high rate of PIPs in the community pharmacy is not further 20 174 J. Environ. Res. Public Health2020,17, 1473 9 of 13The published repeatability study of the POPI tool [18] found good repeatability despite the highcomplexity and mixed implicit and explicit approach of the tool.The POPI tool was developed using French, American and UK guidelines and has been validatedin clinical practice, with the above study showing that it is able to detect some potentially irrationalprescribing in French settings. It is not yet known whether it detects irrational prescribing thatcorrelates to adverse events or patient outcomes, or whether it could be used to evaluate prescribingoutside French practice.Although not published as a clinical validation study, there is a published study using the PIPccriteria to detect potentially irrational prescribing [19] (Table3). In this study, the criteria were appliedto a national pharmacy claims database in Ireland, the Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS)with a cross-sectional methodology. The database records pharmacy claims for medicines for eligiblepatients prescribed by general practitioners or transcribed from hospital prescriptions by generalpractitioners, with limited patient demographic data (age, gender and region). No clinical detailsof the patients are recorded. The rate of PIO rose to 11.5% when including the criterion relating toco-prescription of a space device. Similarly, a single criterion had a large impact on PIPs and when thiscriterion, relating to carbocisteine, was removed the PIP rate fell to 0.29%.One signicant limitation in this study was that it highlighted the di\u0000culty in applying eventhe intentionally simple and explicit criteria of PIPc to retrospective anonymised data. The age ofpatients in the PCRS database was recording in age bands of 0-4 years, 5-11 years, and 12-15 years.In several cases, these bands overlapped age limits described in PIPc criteria. In order to analyse thedata, the authors made calculations to estimate the number of children of a certain age. For example,to calculate the number of children under 2 years in the 0-4 years band, the total number of children inthe band was divided by 5 and multiplied by 2. This assumes a normal distribution of ages, whichmay not be the case.There is no published repeatability study of PIPc.A clinical validation study of the modied POPI (UK) tool has only been published in abstractform [12] (Table3). There is currently no published repeatability study for the modied POPI (UK) tool.3.8. Comparison with Existing Adult Rational Prescribing ToolsAll of the paediatric tools identied cover a range of types of rational prescribing, with the POPIand modied POPI (UK) tools covering a particularly broad range. By comparison, the majority ofadult tools identied by Kaufmann et al. [4] had a narrower focus.Of the 46 adult tools identied by Kaufmann et al., the median number of aspects of rationalprescribing covered by each tool was 4.5, similar to the PIPc, which covers ve aspects. However, fourtools did cover eight or nine categories of prescribing, which is comparable to the POPI and modiedPOPI (UK), which cover eight.The PIPc is designed for use in primary care settings, while the POPI tool and modied POPI(UK) are developed for application in a range of settings. The breadth of applications of both the POPItool and modied POPI (UK) tool is similar to a number of rational prescribing tools for older adults,which have been used in settings including nursing homes, emergency departments, and primary care.Of the adult tools evaluated by Kaufmann et al., the majority of tools (28) were explicit, a minority(8) were implicit, and the remaining 10 used a mixed approach like POPI. Implicit criteria may be moreaccurate, as they can take into account individual patient requirements, but this may come at the costof reliability as they are more dependent on the rater's knowledge and judgement [5]. The reverseis true of explicit tools, which are less reliant on rater judgement and therefore might be expectedto have greater repeatability and reliability and be less time-consuming to apply, with concomitantlower accuracy. Therefore, mixed tools may stand to inherit both the advantages and disadvantages ofeach approach.The authors of the original POPI state that the tool comprises explicit criteria; however, in both thePOPI and modied POPI (UK) tools a number of criteria contain judgement-based and patient-specic 175 Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health2020,17, 1473 10 of 13considerations. Other propositions require taking into account the patient's co-morbidities and entiremedication regimen, characteristics that are usually considered components of implicit (patient-specic)criteria. For example, several propositions require the rater to make subjective judgements, such as inthe theme of Attention Decit Disorder, which includes \"Pharmacological treatment before age six...except in severe cases\" [7] (p. 7).In some cases, the modied POPI (UK) amended criteria replace subjective judgements with explicitquantied cut-os to reflect similarly precise recommendations in the UK guidelines.For instancewhere the original POPI tool lists a PIO inhaler appropriate for child's age\", themodied with Dry Powder Inhaler maybe appropriate)\" [12].The PIPc criteria are entirely explicit and do not require evaluation of a patient's condition orsubjective judgements. One criterion that may require non-anonymised data for full evaluation,however, is the recommendation in the Respiratory System theme, that \"Children under 12 years whoare prescribed a pressurised metered-dose inhaler should also be prescribed a spacer device at leastevery 12 months\" [11] (p. 8). In order to assess this with certainty, the rater would need to be ableto see all prescriptions for the child within the prior twelve months. Nonetheless, these criteria areall explicit.4. DiscussionThis systematic literature review identied three rational prescribing tools for use in paediatricpractice, the PIPc, the POPI tool, and the modied POPI (UK) tool.There are a number of research and clinical applications for rational prescribing tools.The varying characteristics of the three paediatric rational prescribing tools identied haveimplications for their use and impact in future work. PIPc is intended only for primary care settings,while the POPI and modied (UK) POPI tools can be applied in any paediatric setting.All three tools could be used for both clinical governance and research purposes to identify areas ofproblematic prescribing, compare rates of irrational prescribing between settings, grades or specialtiesof prescribers, or regions. Because the tools provide a means to quantify rational prescribing, they mayalso facilitate the evaluation of educational or quality improvement interventions. The tools could alsobe used to assess factors associated with problematic prescribing.In terms of structure and complexity, the POPI tool comprises a relatively high number of criteriacompared with many other tools, although there is one published tool targeted at older adults with 392quality indicators (not all of which relate to rational prescribing), ACOVE-3 [20]. The PIPc has closer tothe lowest number of criteria of the adult tools. Some of the tools detailed in the Kaufmann systematicreview have as few as ten criteria, for instance the Medication Appropriateness Index (MAI) [21],which is also targeted at older adults. A simple count of criteria is not necessarily a useful measureof complexity however. For example, in the case of the MAI, it is intended that all ten criteria areapplied to each drug a patient is prescribed, where some systems simply list medications that arecontraindicated or essential.The high number of propositions and mixed implicit and explicit approach of the POPI tool makesit quite high in complexity, thus it requires a high level of clinical knowledge to apply.Some patientsmay fall within multiple themes, for instance Pain and fever might be expected alongside a numberof other themes with an infectious focus, such as Urinary Infections and ENT Infections, and otherthemes describe long-term conditions that any child might have as co-morbidity. The theme of VitaminSupplements and Antibiotic Prophylaxis includes a proposition describing minimum vitamin D intake,which would need to be assessed for every child. This would therefore require a high level of familiaritywith the tool for accurate use and necessitates access to a high level of information about each patient.By contrast, the PIPc is by design a tool that is simpler to apply and that requires minimal clinicalinformation about a patient. The only clinical diagnosis specied in the tool is a presumed diagnosis 176 Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health2020,17, 1473 11 of 13of asthma in two criteria, which it appears that a rater is intended to presume on the basis of theprescriptions described, e.g., \"An inhaled short-acting beta-2 agonist should be prescribed to childrenunder 5 years who are also taking a leukotriene receptor antagonist for presumed asthma\" [11] (p. 8).The PIPc is likely to be quicker to apply and does not require the high level of clinical informationrequired by the POPI tool. However, it is also less broad and therefore it will not identify some aspectsof irrational prescribing such as duplication, inappropriate drug duration, or incorrect drug dosage.There are also fewer clinical conditions included within the PIPc as compared with POPI, which maynot reduce its e\u0000cacy as a screening tool in general settings but might reduce its usefulness in morespecialist settings.Further work comparing the sensitivity of the tools to detect rational prescribing and their utilityin dierent clinical settings would be informative. In addition, it would be valuable to assess whetherhigher rates of irrational prescribing as detected by the tools is associated with poorer clinical outcomesor increased rates of adverse drug events.As electronic prescribing becomes increasingly widespread, algorithmic clinical decision supportsystems have been developed to help alert clinicians to potentially inappropriate prescribing. In theolder adult population where the Beers criteria and STOPP/START criteria are well-established, acomputerised clinical decision support system integrating these rational prescribing tools has beendeveloped [22]. This may be another avenue for further development towards greater rationalprescribing for children by integrating one or more of the identied rational prescribing tools in asimilar model.The study of rational prescribing in children is a neglected area of research [23,24]. Studies ofthe value of these tools in dierent clinical settings by dierent investigators is needed to evaluatehow useful the tools are. Such studies are essential to improve rational prescribing in dierentpaediatric populations.5. ConclusionsThis systematic literature search identied three rational prescribing tools for use in assessingpotentially inappropriate prescribing in paediatric settings, the PIPc, the POPI tool, and the modiedPOPI (UK) tool. We have outlined the characteristics of the tools, including their modes of design,aspects of rational prescribing assessed, and intended practice settings, which may assist readers inmaking use of the tools in their own clinical practice or for further research. The paucity of paediatricrational prescribing tools compared to adult tools shows that this remains a relatively underdevelopedeld of study with great potential for future project administration, F.C.

Irrational prescribing can lead to suboptimal treatment for patients, increased rates of adverse events or drug interactions, and waste of organisational resources that could be spent on health needs. The situation in paediatric prescribing has been described as an \"evidence-based desert\"1with high rates of use of off-label and unlicensed drugs.The aim of this study was to review the current research literature on rational prescribing in paediatrics and to conduct a systematic literature search for screening tools designed for use in this field.

Criterialists are well-established as research tools in rational prescribingfor adults but only one tool has been developed for paediatricpractice. The French'POPI'criteria comprise 105 inappropriateprescriptions or omissions. Having revised these to align with UKclinical guidelines, our aim was to assess the usefulness of themodified POPI criteria by evaluating their relevance to UK paedi-atric patients.MethodsThis study was a single centre prospective observationalstudy of 400 paediatric patients (0-18 years) in a children's emer-gency department and two paediatric wards. The only exclusioncriterion was lack of parent/carer consent. Diagnoses, symptomsand prescriptions were recorded and checked against the modi-fied POPI tool.ResultsPatient age ranged from 3 days to 17 years. The mediannumber of prescriptions per patient was 2.5 (range 0-26). 343patients attended with at least one clinical indication in the tool.255 were in the category of Pain or Fever; the next most fre-quent were Nausea, Vomiting or Gastro-oesophageal Reflux(n=123), Cough (n=77) and Diarrhoea (n=36). 29 cases hadone or more inappropriate prescriptions or theserelated to Pain Fever Gastro-oesophageal Reflux (n=1), and comprised 20 omissions and 12 inappropriateprescriptions.ConclusionsThe modified POPI criteria detected 32 inappropri-ate prescriptions or omissions. However, 7/21 clinical categorieswere not relevant to any patients in the study. Furthermore, anumber of frequent presentations are absent from the criteria,including sepsis (n=36), viral-induced wheeze (n=35) and lowerrespiratory tract infections (n=26). In 27 cases, it was not possi-ble to determine objectively whether or not an inappropriate pre-scription had occurred, highlighting complexity and subjectivitywithin the criteria. This study demonstrates the potential for acriteria list to act as a useful tool in studying rational prescribingfor children. However, it also highlighted a number of limitationsthat must be resolved in order to develop an effective paediatricrational prescribing tool.G213ABSTRACT: UNDIAGNOSED DISEASES IN A Roza, L Kerecuk.Rare Diseases, NHS, Birmingham, UK10.1136/archdischild-2017-313087.210AimsThere is limited information on how many patients areundiagnosed.

Before you decide we would like you to understand why the research is being done and what it would involve for you. One of our team will go through the information sheet with you and answer any questions you have. Talk to others about the study if you wish. Ask us if there is anything that is not clear. What is the purpose of the study? The study is testing a new checklist, called \"POPI\" (Paediatric Omissions of Prescriptions and Inappropriate Prescriptions), which will be used to check that medicines are being prescribed for children in line with the most up-to-date guidelines and scientific evidence. This is the first time POPI has been used in the UK so our main question will be: 1) Is POPI useful in the UK? We will also use POPI to see if there are any ways in which our prescribing could be improved, so we are also testing: 2) Does POPI identify any missed or inappropriate prescriptions according to the checklist? It only involves looking at prescriptions that have already been written and includes looking at children who did not have any medicines prescribed. Why have we been invited? You are being invited to take part because your child is attending Royal Derby Hospital. We are inviting 600 participants like you to take part Do we have to take part? 218 It is up to you to decide whether or not to take part. If you do decide to take part you will be given this information sheet to keep and be asked to sign a consent form. If your child is aged 6-15 years we would like them to also be involved in the decision-making process and will ask them to sign their agreement (\"assent\") if they would like to take part. If you decide to take part you are still free to withdraw at any time and without giving a reason. This would not affect your legal rights. What will happen to my child if we take part? One of our team will talk to you and ask if you want to join in. If you are happy to take part, we will record your prescriptions (list of medicines) and reason for being in hospital from your medical notes. You won't need to do anything else. It will only take 10 minutes but you can stop at any time. If you decide to stop, this will not affect the care you receive, simply let one of your child's medical team or one of the researchers know. It will not be possible for any information that has already been collected to be deleted or removed from the study. Expenses and payments Participants will not be paid to participate in the study. What are the possible disadvantages and risks of taking part? There are no risks or disadvantages that have been identified. What are the possible benefits of taking part? We cannot promise the study will help you but the information we get from this study may help us study the use of medicines in children in the future. What happens when the research study stops? 219 After the project finishes next summer, if you want to find out what happened you will be able to read about it on our website: https://nottingham.ac.uk/research/groups/paediatricmedicines/index.aspx What if there is a problem? If you have a concern about any aspect of this study, you should ask to speak to the researchers who will do their best to answer your questions. The researchers contact details are given at the end of this information sheet. If you remain unhappy and wish to complain formally, you can do this by contacting the Patient Advice & Liaison Service part in the study be kept confidential? We will follow ethical and legal practice and all information about you will be handled in confidence. If you join the study, some parts of your child's medical records and the data collected for the study will be looked at by authorised persons from the University of Nottingham who are organising the research. They may also be looked at by authorised people to check that the study is being carried out correctly. All will have a duty of confidentiality to your child as a research participant and we will do our best to meet this duty. All information which is collected about your child during the course of the research will be kept strictly confidential, stored in a secure and locked office, and on a password protected database. Any information about your child which leaves the hospital will have his/her name and address 220 removed (anonymised) and a unique code will be used so that he/she cannot be recognised from it. Your child's personal data (address, telephone number) will be kept for up to 3 months after the end of the study so that we are able to contact you about the findings of the study and possible follow-up studies (unless you advise us that you do not wish to be contacted). All other data (research data) will be kept securely for 7 years. After this time your child's data will be disposed of securely. During this time all precautions will be taken by all those involved to maintain your child's confidentiality, only members of the research team will have access to your child's personal data. If a missed prescription or possible inappropriate prescription were to be identified according to the checklist, the consultant doctor looking after your child would be informed at the time. What will happen if we don't want to carry on with the study? Your participation is voluntary and you are free to withdraw at any time, without giving any reason, and without your legal rights being affected. If you withdraw then the information collected so far cannot be erased and this information may still be used in the project analysis. Involvement of the General Practitioner/Family doctor (GP) Your GP will not be involved in this study. What will happen to the results of the research study? The results may be published in academic journals or presented at conferences. They will also be included in an academic dissertation about the project. All data will be anonymised. These publications will be publicised on our website: https://nottingham.ac.uk/research/groups/paediatricmedicines/index.aspx Who is organising and funding the research? This research is being organised by the University of Nottingham and has no external funding. 221 Who has reviewed the study? All research in the NHS is looked at by independent group of people, called a Research Ethics Committee, to protect your interests. This study has been reviewed and given favourable opinion by [complete when allocated] Research Ethics Committee.
