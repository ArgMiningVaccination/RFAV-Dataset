Year Seven Report 1 2/7/17 Overview INSTITUTIONAL OVERVIEW National University of Natural Medicine (NUNM) , home to the oldest programmatically accredited naturopathic medica l education institution in North America, was e stablished in 1956 under the name National Co llege of Naturopathic Medicine (NCNM) . During its first four decades of existence, the college had one primary objective: education leading to the Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine (ND) degree. In the 1990s, the college expanded its mission to include the training of other natural health care practitioners. In line with its classical approach to principles that guide naturopathic care, the college developed curricula emphasi zing the holistic spirit of the classical teachings of Chinese medicine. With its shift to a multi - purpose institution, a new name was chosen - National College of Natural Medicine (NCNM) - and announced at its 50th Anniversary in 2006. In 2016, following Oregon HECC and NWCCU approval to offer undergraduate education, the institution changed its name again to reflect its status as a university. In June 2016, in honor of its 60th Anniversary, NCNM became known as National University of Natural Medicine (NUN M). The ND program and its affiliated certificate programs are housed within the university's College of Naturopathic Medicine. The College of C lassical Chinese Medicine offers three degree programs , the Master of Science in Oriental Medicine (MSOM), the Master in Acupuncture (MAc), and the Doctor of Science in Oriental Medicine (DSOM), as well as imbedded certificate programs. The institution is teaching out its MAc program as it considers a potential redesign of the smaller scope of practice reflected in the MAc in the context of NUNM's recently reframed MSOM and changes in accreditation standards of the specialty accreditor . Profession -wide discussion s are currently underway as regards the use of the word \"Oriental\" in degree tit les. NUNM is monitoring that discussion closely and will apply for a change to the titles of the MSOM and DSOM utilizing input resulting from those discussion s. In 2012 , the School of Research and Graduate Studies (SoRGS) was developed to house programs supporting health and natural medicine themes central to the institution's core programs in naturopathic and classical C hinese medicine s. SoRGS c urrently offers the following four master's programs : Master of Science in In tegrative Medic ine Research (MSi MR); Master of Science in Nutrition (MScN ); Master of Science in Global Health (MScGH ); and Master of Science in Integrative Mental Health (MSiMH). NWCCU has also approved a Master of Science in Sports Medicine (MScSM ) degree. It is antici pated that the first class could matriculate as early as fall 2017 or winter 2018 . These master 's programs deliver education that either complements a clinical degree, such as the ND, MSOM, and DSOM, or lead s to non - clinical career paths. NU NM st udents may pursue two graduate or first professional degree programs concurrently. In fall 2016, t he School of Undergraduate Studies (SUS) matriculated its first cohorts to the Bachelor of Science in Integrative Health (BSiHS) and Bachelor of Science in Nutrition (BScN) programs . These programs provide the final two years of study for undergraduate s tudents interested in pursuing careers or further training and/or research in the natural health sciences and are tailored to our graduate level offerings. Since 1956, NU NM has awarded 2,997 degrees, with many graduates receiving more than one degree. The following table provides an overview of programs including prog ram len gth, identification of the first year the institution matriculated students into the program, and the number of graduates as of June 2016, our most recent commencement.

As of fall 2016, NUNM is home to 653 full- and part -time students and 317 employees . Buildings within the campus footprint consist of the following : Academic B uilding, a total of 60,000 square feet, includ es classrooms, lecture halls, laboratories, the libr ary, a few offices, and the NUNM Store; Administration B uilding , provides the bulk of the university's office space and includes the newly - opened Stone -Bleything Wing ; Radelet Hall (formerly known as the Annex) , a large lecture space named in honor of Betty Radelet, ND, DC, the first woman to graduate from the institution ; NUNM Health Center -Lair Hill incorporates 18,000 square feet of consultation, e xamination, and treatment rooms , and a lab and medicinary ; The Services Building, currently under consideration for repurposing, provides a total of 8,824 square feet ; Three houses owned by NUNM are located within the campus footprint, t wo of which are rental properties, and the third, Spaulding House (purchased and repurposed in 2014 -15), accommodates the NUNM Institutes (excluding Helfgott Institute) . Also part of the campus but outside the campus footprint is the Helfgott Research Institute and Community Education Center, home to NUNM's research acti vities and Charle e's Teaching K itchen . Helfgott was established in 2003 with the mission of conducting rigorous, quality research on the art and science of healing, specifically working to understand natural forms of medicine . The i nstitute includes a clas sroom , clinical research laboratory, and office space. In addition to pursuing grants funded by sources such as the National Institutes of Health's National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, Helfgott pursues collaborative grants with other institutions such as Oregon Health & S cience University , as well as company funded research . Through the i nstitute, students are provided the opportunity to participate in and pursue their own individual research under the guidance of faculty mentors. In addition to the Health Center within the campus footprint , the university operates a clinic in Beaverton, Oregon (added since the Year Three report ) and 17 community clinics in the Portland area. The community clinics offer low -cost medical care to med ically underserved populations and provide our medical students with an expanded patient base. NWCCU Year Seven Report 3 2/7/17 Overview In September 2012 , the City of Portland approved the university's Campus Master Plan that provides a blueprint for future campus development and growth. The goals outlined in the plan are designed to allow for flexibility and incremental improvement, providing a framework that will grow the campus in a manner that serves NUNM's long-term academic needs. (See Standard Two, 2.G.3., page 91, for further discu ssion of the master plan.) In executing the master plan, a number of facilities changes have occurred since the Year Three report and are detailed under Changes to Facilities in the Preface. As part of the master planning process, NUNM commissioned ECONorthwest to measure the economic impact of NUNM's activities on the three -coun ty Portland metropolitan area. The Economic Impact Report, dated March 7, 2012, is based upon data from Academic Year 2011, and indicates that, in total, NUNM spending and ac tivities were associated with $55.9 million in economic activity to t he Portland metropolitan area.

Both reviews led to reaccreditation for the maximum amount of time awarded - seven years. The Core Themes provide d guidance to both self - study processes and inform our program deans in the development and implementation of their strategic plans in sup port of th e mission of the institution. Our three year self -study process launched in September 2013 with formation of the CNME steering committee and continued with the ACAOM steering committee in March 2015. Assessment processes, including recommendation s from these self -studies, combined with the Year Three report, provide a foundation for the NWCCU Year Seven Comprehensive Self -Evaluation process. On July 21, 2016, the Year Seven Steering Committee, whose membership was derived from NWCCU Year Three, C NME, and ACAOM steering committees, met to discuss assignments specific to the Year Seven Report, including chair assignments for each of the Core Themes, writing assignments, review of documents received in trainings by members of the team, and review and editing of the timeline for completion of the Year Seven Comprehensive Self -Evaluation. The first assignment was creation of a report (Core Theme Achievement Narrative - appendix 0.1) that provided a sequential discussion of all Core Themes, objectives, and indicators including data captured, utilization of data toward initiating improvements, and recommendations to improve indicators for the next seven year cycle. This document is referenced through out this self -evaluation report. After completion of a first draft of appendix 0.1, the committee began updating Standards One and Two from the Year Three Self-Evaluation and drafting Standards Three, Four, and Five. A monthly meeting time was set aside fo r utilization by individual committees or the committee as a whole as needed, although most communications starting in August were via e -mail or through regularly scheduled team meetings. The evaluation process led to generation of recommendations draft ed by the Steering Committee. The finalized recommendations are provided throughout the self -evaluation and are summarized under Conclusions. Recommendations were reviewed and approved by the Academic Operations Team (January 5, 2017), President's Cabinet (January 10, 2017), and Enrollment Management Team (January 26, 2017). The Academic Affairs Committee of the Board endorsed the recommendations at its January 23, 2017 meeting. The full board approved the recommendations by electronic vote on February 1, 2017 . Confirmation will be entered into the minu tes of the February 24 board meeting. The document \"NWCCU Steering Committee Guiding Concepts\" that summarizes the July 21, 2016 meeting is available in appendix 0.2.

The building that houses the NUNM Health Center - Lair Hill and the adjacent Services Building are two of these. The lease purchase arrangement included a term certain agreement for a 1031 exchange within the provis ions of IRS regulations. The refinancing structure included a SNAP bond issued through the State of Oregon Facilities Authority, in collaboration with Pacific Continental Bank. Currently under consideration is utilization of surplus proceeds from the re financing to repurpose the Services Building into a modern, multi -purpose , educational facility to hous e new programming and to expand support for existing programming. The third building, a warehouse attached to the campus Health Center building, was demo lished to create the Min Zidell Healing Garden , one of three greenspaces within the NUNM footprint. NWCCU Year Seven Report 14 2/7/17 Preface The Zidell Garden is a botanical teaching garden with a labyrinth and gazebo. Galen's Way Garden, adjacent to one of our rental properties, is a community garden. Spaulding House, as discussed in the Institutional Overview, was purchased and repurposed in 2014-15, and accommodates the NUNM Institutes (excluding Helfgott Institute). These Institutes - Age Wise, Food as Medicine, Tradition al Roots, and Women in Balance - reflect an expansion in our community education offerings, providing tastes of our medic ines for the general public as well as augmenting not-for-credit educational opportuni ties to our internal community. Spaulding House provides a strategic corner property that allowed NUNM to apply for decommissioning of a street for which the City of Por tland has approved the final steps allowing us to convert it into a third green space to be named the Minh Chau Garden . Since the Year Three Report, the university also opened a clinic in Beaverton, Oregon . SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES WITHIN DEGREE PROGRAMS The first year of a redesigned ND program was implemented in academic year 2015 -16. The redesigned curriculum includes block modules, earlier clinical exposure, an increase in active learning, and a more vigorous development of our students' critical think ing skills. Although a four year program, teaching out the foundational curriculum will take six years because of students enrolled concurrently in more than one degree program. For example, concurrent study of the ND and MSOM is designed as a six year tra ck. The curriculum change was approved through NUNM's internal change processes including faculty review and by its specialty accreditor, Council on Naturopathic Medical Education. The competencies of the MSOM degree program are now nested within the comp etencies of the DSOM program . Through the faculty driven process of developing the DSOM, the MSOM p rogram learning outcomes and competencies were refined . New Programs Implemented A number of degree programs have been im plemented since the Year Three R eport was submitted on Mar ch 1, 2014. Two are housed within the School of Research and Graduate Studies - Master of Science in Global Health and Master of Science in Integrative Mental Health . Within the College of Classical Chinese Medicine, the DSOM degr ee launched September 2015 . Two undergraduate degrees within our new School of Undergraduate Studies admitted their first students in September 2016. Below are overviews of our new for credit degree programs. School of Research and Graduate Studies (SoRGs ) The School of Research and Graduate Studies has implemented two new master degree programs since the Year Three Report: Master of Science in Integrative Mental Health (MSiMH) and Master of Science in Global Health (MScGH). As of fall 2016, NUNM has a to tal of 23 MScGH students and has graduated 11 students with this degree. As of fall 2016 there are 32 MSiMH concurrent track students. There are not yet any graduates from this program.

NWCCU Year Seven Report 15 2/7/17 Preface Master of Science in Global Health - MScGH The first cohort of MScGH students was admitted in fall 2014. Significant revisions have been made to the MScGH during the first two years in response to structural, academic , and student needs. These changes include a realignment of the program to follow a public health degree model, changes to both required and elective courses , and revisions to the fieldwork and cultural immersion trip portions of the program. These changes are outlined in more detail below. The movement toward a more traditional public health degree was a result of an analysis of jobs in the global health field. Because most jobs are public health oriented, the public health focus will make NUNM graduates more competitive for these positions. A global health manual was created to outli ne all aspects of fieldwork site and student expectations (available on site). Students in the MScGH program, unlike some master's programs, complete cultural immersion trips and a fieldwork project as a requirement for degree completion. The MScGH emphasi zes a whole -systems approach to global health, while accentuating public health through traditional and integrative medicine education. Students consider traditional and preventive integrative medicine solutions for a variety of global health challenges. Revisions to the MScGH program after year one include strengthening core knowledge, mentoring, and the development of learning contracts to help track field work learning objectives. Because incoming students were not familiar enough with integrative medi cine modalities and traditional therapies, the Intro to Integrative Medicine course has become a required course for students in the MScGH program. Additionally, two electives were added - Technical Writing and Grant Writing - with a specific focus on writing foundation and community based grants. Revisions were made to improve the Global Health Discussion Series. A formalized mentorship program was established in which learning contracts are used to outline fieldwork outcomes tailored to individual student projects. More detail on this can be found in the global health manual. Following the second year of the MScGH program there were some course rearrangements and electives added based on evaluation of student skills. The Global Health Practicum was rede signed to have a more formalized curriculum, which involves working with community partners. Timesheets were implemented to track fieldwork hours and activities as well as increase accountability. Cultural immersion trips are now required rather than elect ives. Master of Science in Integrative Mental Health - MSiMH The MSiMH program 's first enrollment of 18 students was in fall 2015. The MSiMH only admits students who are concurrently enrolled in a medical degree at NUNM or are already licensed clinicia ns. The current enrollment for this program is 32 students. The MSiMH program will graduate its first class in spring 2019 and is designed to train practitioners in a whole systems approach to mental and emotional wellbeing. The curriculum combines complementary modalities such as nutrition, mind -body medicine, and somatic therapies with conventional care for mental health concerns , and culminates in a nine month clinical practicum in which students apply their knowledge and skills with clients in a real-world clinical setting. Revisions and proposed changes were evaluated at the end of the first year after having MSiMH specific focus groups. After the first round of focus groups, the creation of a required counseling skills tutorial occurring in ye ar two of the program was implemented in order to bridge the skills taught in years one and three of the program. The course was also moved to earlier in fall term so that students experience this skills training for use in later course work. Since the NWCCU Year Three Report, indicator s in support of objectives and Core T hemes have been develope d for both of these new programs. These include development of program specific annual exit survey questions toward assessing the level to which the curricula r etain the classical roots of their medicines , and indicators for achievement of minimum competency standards utilizing data from clinical entrance and exit exams in the MSiMH and rubric -guided evaluations of written and oral presentation of NWCCU Year Seven Report 16 2/7/17 Preface practical field work projects for the MScGH. The Core Theme Achievement Narrative ( appendix 0.1) provides additional information concerning the new indicators. Impact on the Institution of the Addition of the New Master's P rograms This School now offers four graduate pr ograms: Master of Science in Integrative Mental Health (MSiMH), Master of Science in Global Health (MScGH), Master of Science in Nutrition (MScN), and Master of Science in Integrative Medicine Research (MSiMR). A Master of Science in Sports Medicine has be en approved by NWCCU but has not yet been implemented. Students from the Colleges of Naturopathic and Classical Chinese Medicine may take elective courses within SoRGS or complete second degrees to enhance their education and future job opportunities. Bas ed upon enrollment figures, elective course offerings have been adjusted to match the enrollment demand. Less popular electives may only run once per year or once every other year. Popular electives will continue to run twice per year. Faculty are shared a mong the various colleges and schools, providing a consistent set of natural medicine values and principles for all students at NUNM. The addition of these programs is attracting students and faculty with a broader scope of interests, and different backgr ounds and skill sets. This ultimately strengthens the university and expands the knowledge base available to the natural medicine community. Adequacy of Administrative , Faculty, Financial, Library, and Facilities Support for t he Program's Objectives In 2012, NUNM opened the Helfgott Research Institute & Community Education Center in a newly renovated building a few blocks north of the academic campus. This building, which previously housed the NUNM teaching clinic, now provides a facility for the School of Research and Graduate Studies. It contains space for faculty offices, some study space, and a conference area. There are three teaching spaces that include a classroom, teaching kitchen, and a basic science laboratory. In addition, courses may be offere d on the main academic campus. The registrar was able to successfully schedule classes for all programs using existing space for the 2 016- 17 academic year; however, t he individual schedules of some students within the School of Research and Graduate Studi es was not optimal utilizing existing classrooms. Recommendation: The schedules of some students in Academic Year 2016 -17 was not optimal utilizing existing classrooms. W ith new classes offered in the coming year, it is recommended that an additional classroom is identified and converted for the coming academic year. The dean of the School of Research and Graduate Studies oversees the degree programs. The dean also serves as the director of Helfgott Research Institute , with the s upport of an associate director. The leadership structure includes an associate and an assistant dean as well as degree program chairs. The selected chair faculty members receive administrative wor k units under their faculty contracts. Chair duties include, but are not limited to, program promotion, evaluation of applications for admission, evaluating transfer credit, ensuring program outcomes and competencies, running faculty meetings, and student advising. We began the new degree programs by utilizing e xisting teaching faculty and have hired additional adjunct faculty as necessary. There are currently five full -time faculty in the MScGH program, and one full -time faculty member in the MSiMH program. The faculty for both programs are conventionally qualified and diverse in their edu cation and experience and possess the following graduate degrees: PhD, ND, MCR (Master of Clinical Research), MSW, EdM, and MPH. The long -term plan is to increase the number of full - time faculty as student enrollment increases. NWCCU Year Seven Report 17 2/7/17 Preface Administrative support is currently adequate; however, it will need to increase as the number of students in the degree programs rises. An example is in the area of admissions. By academic year 2018 -19 it is anticipated that an admissions counselor dedicated to the School of Re search and Graduate S tudies will be needed, and the Admissions O ffice is tracking this need in their budget planning processes. Recommendation: The Office of Admissions will continue to monitor the need for program specific admissions counselors, espec ially within the multi -program School of Research and Graduate Studies. The direct costs of instruction are covered by tuition from the programs. With increased enrollment, the five year plan for the School projects that within three years the programs will be able to cover overhead expenses in addition to program costs. The School has appointed a faculty represen tative to attend the quarterly Library C ommittee meetings to discuss the specific needs of the graduate school. The NUNM library has invested resources toward improving holdings in anticipation of the new graduate programs. I n fall 2014 we added the Scopus database, a citation and abstract database of peer -reviewed literature covering over 21,000 journals, books and conference proceedings in a wide range of fields including science, technology, medicine, and the social sciences. This database is of particular interest to researchers because it includes citation indexing, which provides a way to judge the impact of a research article by tracking who cited it in later publications. PsycARTICLES full -text databases were added fall 2015. The Journal of H unger & Environmental Nutrition, added in fall 2016, addresses global food and water system issues that impact access, nutrition, human health and ec ological health. In fall 2016 , we also subscribed to Wise Traditions in Food, Farming, and the Healing Arts , the Weston Price Foundation's quarterly journal. The NUNM library does not hold a substantial eBook collection; in fall 2015 it purchased 12 titl es, of which four are titles relevant to SoRGS programs. A small budget for eBooks is available in the current academic year and will be considered by the Library Committee as regards needs of the SoRGS degree programs. The technology within research libraries has evolved to include increasingly complex databases, and in the coming years, the library budget will include access to additional electronic resources related to global and mental health. The library has created library guides online including o ne for AMA citation style, in response to the feedback provided at the committee meetings. Evidence of Program E ffectiveness Assessment of the two newest programs within the School of Research and Graduate Studies is integrated into the ongoing assessmen t processes already in place at NUNM. As is the case with all of the degree programs of the university, faculty of the new degree programs have mapped program competencies to the course level. SoRGS students join their peer NUNM students in regularly sche duled assessment efforts such as the annual student satisfaction survey, cultural climate surveys, quarterly student evaluations of courses and faculty, and the graduating student exit survey. NUNM conducts regular alumni surveys to assess alumni success. Graduates of the School of Research and Graduate Studies are included in this survey. In addition to the anonymous course and faculty evaluations by students, faculty also complete a self - evaluation and meet with the dean or program chair for annual eval uation to discuss professional development and teaching strategies. Changes in course content and teaching effectiveness are addressed at these meetings and at additional meetings with faculty throughout the year. Since these programs are re latively new, they are continuously being monitored for effectiveness through student performance, feedback, and internship or career placement. The following are examples of some of these program specific measures. NWCCU Year Seven Report 18 2/7/17 Preface Indicators toward achievement of Core Themes and ob jectives have been developed for the new programs, and data is being tracked or is scheduled for tracking. An example of data already tracked includes exit survey data from graduating students and one -year-past-graduation employment data. For example, tw o graduating MScGH students from year one and several students from year two were hired directly by the organizations with which they interned. Mean GPA data of incoming students is tracked. The table below provides the mean GPA of students accepted into the School of R esearch and Graduate Studies. T he mean is consistent over the last three years. MEAN GPA OF ACCEPTED APPLICANTS SCHOOL OF RESEARCH AND GRADUATE STUDIES 2014 2015 2016 3.32 3.39 3.36 Scheduled for tracking are data from MSiMH clinic entrance exams and exit exams and scores on written and oral presentation of practical fieldwork projects for the MScGH. Electives are monitored and adjusted or added as needed. Continuing assessm ent of the effectiveness of the program s and program changes will be made using student achievement, faculty feedback and performance , as well as program effectiveness assessment. Formative assessment of the new programs is ongoing. Student satisfaction wi th their program is assessed quarterly. Student progress is assessed via the A -F grading system and by quarterly review by the program chair and the dean. Students in the MScGH program are assessed bi -quarterly by their mentor, the program chair, and the program dean. Rubrics have been established to determine appropriate progress and provide consistency across the coursework for both programs. Students who are not making satisfactory progress meet with the program chair and the dean to determine a correct ive course of action, including increased meeting frequency. Students' educational experience culminates in a master's fieldwork project for global health, and in a clinical practicum for the MSiMH program. The data recounted above is used to inform progra m effectiveness and recommended changes. College of Classical Chinese Medicine (CCM) NUNM has launched one new program within its College of Classical Chinese Medicine since the Year Three Report: Doctor of Science in Oriental Medicine (DSOM). The MSOM p rogram is fully contained within the DSOM, with the latter being an additional 48 credits and 582 hours. Following NWCCU approval in April 2015 to offer the DSOM, MSOM students were allowed to apply for and matriculate into the DSOM through an application process that includes the submission of essays and an interview with the program dean. As the degree is still in the approval process with the programmatic accreditor, the Accreditation Commission on Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (ACAOM), students in t he DSOM graduate with both the MSOM and DSOM degrees. Students in one of NUNM's other graduate degree programs may also apply for concurrent study of the MSOM/DSOM. Impact on the Institution of the Addition of the DSOM Program The College of CCM has lon g offered as electives many of the courses that distinguish the DSOM, such as the Classical Texts I -IX series and the Advanced Cosmology and Symbolism I -III series; however, the courses were not eligible for financial aid, a limiting factor for some studen ts. While the MSOM program already met the majority of the doctoral level competencies defined by ACAOM, new courses were created for the DSOM to ensure and extend the level of attainment of these doctoral level competencies in the areas of systems -based medicine and professional development. These include CCM View of Biomedicine, Healthcare Landscape, Eastern and Western Correspondences, and Imaginal and Experiential Inquiries I - XIII. MSOM students receive the benefit that they are able to access any of t he DSOM -specific courses as NWCCU Year Seven Report 19 2/7/17 Preface electives. The DSOM enables interested students to attain a higher level of fulfillment of the CCM mission with the support of federal financial aid. Students from the naturopathic medicine and SoRGs programs may also take the D SOM courses as electives, provided they have met the prerequisites. To facilitate prioritization of schedules for students in multiple programs, each concurrent student is required to declare a primary program. In fall 2015, there were 19 entering NUNM s tudents for whom a CCM program was their primary program (i.e. not ND -CCM concurrent students for whom the ND program is considered primary). Of these, 37% chose the DSOM program. In the winter admit cohort of that academic year, there were four entering D SOM students and no MSOM students. In the fall of 2016, 24 \"primary CCM\" students entered NUNM, of whom 67% chose the DSOM. The increase in the size of the entering \"primary CCM\" class, coincident with an increase in the percentage enrolling in the DSOM al erts us to the possibility of a trend. The admission data will continue to be tracked to discern whether the inauguration of the DSOM has indeed improved NUNM's market visibility and perceived value for applicants. During this same period, many AOM schools have experienced a decrease in admissions. In addition to the data on entering students, it has also been fruitful for us to track current NUNM students transitioning between programs. The DSOM program received NWCCU approval in spring 2015, and current ly enrolled students were allowed to apply to add the DSOM. In fall 2015, 32 MSOM students added the DSOM, as did 13 concurrent students. The total number of MSOM and DSOM students in fall 2015 was 163, of which 52 (32%) were DSOM. While the total number o f MSOM and DSOM students remained substantially the same in fall 2016 (162), the number of DSOM students had increased to 64 (40%). Since the start of fall 2015, 19 \"primary ND\" students moved to \"primary DSOM\" status and one Master of Science in Nutriti on student switched to the DSOM program. Over this period, no \"primary DSOM\" students transferred to having their primary degree be either the ND degree or one of the SoRGS programs. The phenomenon of having students transfer between programs internally do es not necessarily lead to a net financial gain for the institution and requires extra administrative work, such as tracking required to calculate attrition by program as well as for the institution. However, it increases the possibility that students will find their optimal program offering at the university. The data does support that the DSOM is a valuable addition to the collection of NUNM program offerings. Revisions Based on the First Year of Experience The College of CCM holds two half -day \"Closin g the Loop\" retreats in the summer months in which a variety of course - and program -level assessments are reviewed by faculty and administration. Areas of success are evaluated for opportunities to enhance what is already working well, and solutions are so ught to address areas of weakness/challenge. In the summer of 2016 retreats, a number of revisions were recommended that affect both the MSOM and DSOM programs. For example, it was decided that the \"associate dean of clinical education will prepare updates by rotation type of the Clinic Evaluation Tool in an effort to simplify the form for use by faculty and students\". This was accomplished in time for implementation in fall quarter 2016. (The new forms are available on site for review.) Another recommendat ion currently being pursued is the following: \"Faculty will continue to discuss possible change to annual comprehensive exams and/or addition of stage -appropriate 'exit exam' after the Clinical Mentoring Rotations (CMR).\" Faculty are actively discussing th e creation of annual, cumulative comprehensive exams that culminate in the written portion of the clinic entrance exam, and are engaged in designing the CMR exit exam. Recommendations specific to the DSOM program focused on one of the primary programmati c assessment tools of the DSOM - the DSOM Capstone Project. The primary focus of one of the summer retreats was to prepare faculty to better serve as a mentor for students engaged in the DSOM Capstone process. (8/2/16 CCM Academic Faculty \"Closing the Loop \" Retreat minutes are available on site.) During the summer retreat, a review of the first group of DSOM Capstone Projects revealed that students had not been well - NWCCU Year Seven Report 20 2/7/17 Preface supported to meet the intended milestones for the process. Only two of four students co mplet ed all three aspects of their capstone project on time. In response, it was decided that the \"CCM administrative coordinator will provide assistance reminding chairs, readers and students of timelines and deadlines. The CCM Office will design a system to h elp track that deadlines are being met.\" A process with appropriate forms was created in the first half of the fall term; all students in the final year of their DSOM program are currently on -track with their capstone process. Imaginal and Experiential I nquiries (IEI) I -XIII is a course series that extends throughout every quarter of the DSOM program. Emphasizing reflective learning, appreciative inquiry, and self -awareness exercises, the courses promote each student's personal engagement with the curricu lum and support their professional development. At the end of spring quarter 2016, the IEI faculty and the CCM dean met to review the success of the series in its first year of implementation. (3/25/2016 Imaginal and Experiential Inquiries Faculty Meeting Minutes are available on site .) Outcomes of the meeting included the creation of a Moodle resource page established by (and for) the IEI faculty, and a decision to have the IEI series play a more significant role in the DSOM capstone process than initially planned. Adequacy of Administrative , Faculty, Financial, Library, and Facilities Support for Program Objectives As the DSOM program is built around the MSOM program, and many of the DSOM -specific courses were already being offered as electives for the MSOM students, there has been no major change in the scheduling needs, library resources, facilities, or overall num ber of faculty required for the DSOM program. CCM has always focused on hiring faculty whose knowledge and skills support achievement of its classically -focused mission; the addition of the DSOM simply re -enforces this imperative. One result of the program is that faculty member Sabine Wilms, PhD, an internationally renowned expert in the translation of the classical text of Chinese medicine, moved from being adjunct to full -time faculty. The clinic rotation requirements are the same for the DSOM and MSOM programs, and it is not expected that the implementation of the DSOM program will lead to a sizeable change in the number of CCM students. Rather, based on survey results and the choices of current students, we anticipate that the major change will be that a greater percentage of the \"stand -alone\" students will choose the DSOM program. There is room for growth in the main clinic, and the university now operates a clinic in a suburb adjacent to Portland (Beaverton) that has direct rapid transit access f rom downtown Portland. In addition, many of the community clinic sites have capacity for more CCM clinic rotations. Since most of the courses offered with the DSOM were already elective offerings within the MSOM, NUNM currently requires no additional cla ssroom space to serve the needs of the DSOM program. The registrar regularly assesses classroom needs, and in this academic year, all DSOM classes as well as MSOM have been projected into the planning cycle. The academic building houses some offices, inclu ding those of the CCM dean and faculty. As the need for more classroom space is needed, offices will be moved to one of the other spaces owned by NUNM. To support the College of Classical Chinese Medicine, including the DSOM program, the library holds a variety of titles representing a broad scope of thought within Chinese medicine. Some of the more notable classical holdings include an English translation of Li Shizhen's six -volume Bencao Gangmu, and bilingual versions of Sun Simiao's Bei Ji Qian Jin Yao Fang, the Neijing, the Nanjing, Zhang Zhong -Jing's Jin Gui Yao Lue and Shang Han Lun. The library also holds a variety of Chinese -English dictionaries and both books and media material to support the study of Chinese language and culture. Via the library' s subscription to Hong Kong University's CHANT database, NUNM students and faculty members have access to the best available online search engine for classical Chinese texts from 1,500 BC (Jiaguwen) to 450 AD. In addition, Wenlin software has been installe d on library computers for the purpose of Chinese character recognition and language learning. There are over 2,000 volumes in the library's Chinese and Oriental medicine collection, roughly 450 of which are completely or partially in Chinese. For the las t NWCCU Year Seven Report 21 2/7/17 Preface several years, the library has worked closely with the head of East Asian cataloging at the University of Oregon to create high -quality catalog records for the Chinese -language materials we acquire. These records contain both English and Chinese characte rs, and Chinese characters are searchable and viewa ble in the new library catalog . The university has also joined founding professor Dr. Heiner Fruehauf's Classical Chinese Medicine Associates Forum, which has numerous articles and videos by national and i nternational scholars seeking to \"honor and restore the classical origins of Chinese medicine\". The library had been subscribing to the database China/Asia On Demand for the last 5 -6 years. It provides full -text access to 150+ medical journals from Asia ( some in English, some in Chinese). It was determined that very few members of the CCM community were accessing this particular database, and the $2,600 previously spent on this resource is now being redirected based on faculty recommendations for books/res ources most relevant to the CCM programs. In the acquisition of new materials, the library follows its collection development policy, which includes an antitheft system as well as a disaster plan. Evidence of Program E ffectiveness Information on the numb er of students who have added the DSOM was discussed above . As a further indicator of program effectiveness, we are tracking the number of students who have transferred out of the DSOM and their reasons for changing programs . Five students who either enter ed or transferred into the DSOM since fall 2015 have since dropped that program and remained in the MSOM. Of these, one made the change for reasons related to academic performance, and another two for \"personal reasons\" not related to any expressed dissati sfaction with the DSOM -specific courses. The remaining two reported that they dropped the program due to dissatisfaction with at least one of the first year DSOM courses. In addition, the dean has fielded several additional concerns expressed by current DSOM students over the delivery and overall content of several of the classical texts courses. Therefore, we are alerted and attending to the apparent need for more support regarding the classical texts portion of the program, for both students and faculty . The classical Chinese language, including the grammar, is a subject most find inherently difficult, and it is not until one advances in their studies that the benefits become a tangible reality. Given the trend towards higher stress and anxiety levels i n contemporary student populations, we have increased our level of support for the students in this challenging program. All students applying to the DSOM are encouraged to meet with the program dean to discuss the nature of the MSOM vs the DSOM programs, with a focus on the proclivities and gifts of the individual applicant. The dean also meets with each incoming DSOM cohort to reinforce understanding of the goals and intended outcomes of the DSOM as compared to the MSOM, with a particular focus on the rig ors and rewards of the classical texts series of courses. Tutors are available for students requiring extra support learning the classical Chinese language and progressing to being able to translate the classical texts of Chinese medicine. In addition, ass ociate dean Zally Adams, M.Ed., is providing instructional design and andragogic support to the classical texts faculty, to ensure that course design and content delivery are truly learner -centered. Changes include the creation of \"flip -class\" videos that students can view at their own pace and requisite degree of repetition, freeing time for classroom discussion and clarification of key concepts. Plans for Continuing Assessment of the Effectiveness of t he Change All courses, including clinic rotations, h ave formative and summative assessments of student performance. The rubrics comprising the clinical evaluation tool (tailored for every type of clinical rotation) include measures specific to the achievement of DSOM -specific competencies. Student progress in the clinic is also discussed by full -time faculty at the end of each clinical faculty meeting, in a manner compliant with FERPA regulations. Program -level assessments gauge how well students are achieving the overall program learning outcomes (PLOs). There are two PL Os specific to the DSOM program. P rogrammatic assessment for these include the Doctoral Capstone Project and specific sections of the Clinic Exit Examination. In addition, we are NWCCU Year Seven Report 22 2/7/17 Preface incorporating case report training as a longitudinal theme th roughout the MSOM and DSOM programs. Case reports will be used to assess whether the more specific and thorough classical training in the DSOM program is reflected in clinical practice and outcomes during each DSOM student's internship year. We will also track publication rates for the case reports written by MSOM versus DSOM students. Faculty are assessed by students at the end of every course. In addition, faculty engage in an annual (full - time faculty) or bi -annual (adjunct faculty) performance evalua tion process with the program dean and associate dean of academics. Data brought to the evaluation meeting includes a summary of all student feedback, a faculty self -evaluation, and additional data provided by the dean's office. The discussion and assessme nt includes a review of the faculty memb er's job performance ( teaching effectiveness and achievement of other job responsibilities), and their professional development, including the desire/need for the incorporation of any new teaching strategies. Recomme nded changes in course content and teaching effectiveness are addressed at these meetings and supported at both the individual faculty level and at CCM faculty meetings and university -wide faculty development offerings throughout the year. Program -level success will be tracked through the following: Student satisfaction as they progress through the program is measured through the annual student satisfaction survey as well as the graduate exit survey . Program completion rates and reasons for separation ar e reviewed. Publication rates for Doctoral Capstone Papers are tracked. Publication rates are monitored for Intern Case Reports . Professional placement rates are maintained by the NUNM Center for Career Development . In particular, we will look for any diff erences in the employment rates of MSOM vs DSOM graduates. Also through the Center for Career Development, as well as regular alumni surveys, we will track the types of employment garnered by MSOM vs DSOM graduates, especially in the areas of teaching, res earch, and inter -professional practice (such as in hospital settings). Alumni surveys will be used to assess alumni success, in terms of both career satisfaction and financial outcomes. School of Undergraduate Studies Please refer to Addenda section of Preface beginning on page 23. NWCCU Year Seven Report 23 2/7/17 Preface ADDENDA UPDATE ON UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS NUNM was granted Candidacy status at the baccalaureate level on February 25, 2105, to offer a Bachelor of Science degree program in Integrative Health and a Bachelor of S cience degree program in Nutrition, effective Fall 2016 (appendix 0.3 - approval letter). In the letter, the Commission requested that we submit an addendum to our Year Seven Report to provide an update on the implementation of the two Bachelor of Science programs . The Bachelor of Science in Integrative Health Sciences (BSiHS) and the Bachelor of Science in Nutrition (BScN) are designed for the student to complete the final two years of undergraduate study with a focus on careers i n the fields of integ rative health sciences. This focus was chosen in support of NUNM's mission, which includes the education of physicians, practitioners, and pre -professionals in the art, science, and research of natural medicine. Courses are taught by faculty appropriately qualified in the areas of instruction. Each program has five clearly identified program outcomes (pages 129 & 136 of the college catalog) that reflect the intention to produce a well -rounded graduate with interpersonal skills and academic preparation in the natural sciences. These competencies are mapped to the course level, and are available on campus. A capstone project is designed by each student, based upon individual interests and career goals, as a springboard to employment or advanced study. The successful applicant to the program will have earned a minimum of 60 semester or 90 quarter credit hours from a regionally accredited college or university with prior studies including general education coursework in the humanities/arts, life sciences, an d social sciences, as well as required science coursework. We have determined a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or higher to be an estimated appropriate indicator for success. NUNM transfers in credits of courses with a GPA of 2.0 or higher, while evaluating courses in the general education curriculum to asce rtain future academic success. We will continue collecting information and looking at student performance to determine the appropriate standards for this population. General education prerequisites for admission are deta iled on page 13 of the catalog and include : 12 quarter or 8 semester credits in Arts and Letters 12 quarter or 8 semester credits in Social Sciences Life Sciences general education met through science requirements: Human Psychology 4 quarter or 3 semester credits; General Biology, full year, science -major level with labs, minimum of 8 quarter or 6 semester credits; General Chemistry full year, science -major level with labs, minimum of 10 quarter or 7 semester credits. Electives/Other Knowledge Areas, 29 quarter or 20 semester credits. NUNM is aware that a well -rounded preparation for employment or advanced study continues to build upon the minimum framework of general education outlined in the prerequisites through the final two years of study. NUNM therefore provides additional coursework that supports the competencies of the degree programs as well as fur thers general education skills. It includes the following: Self-Care & Self - Management; Culture, Identity & Emo tion; Intercultural Communication; Advanced Writing and Self - Reflective Skills, Analytical Business Development; Ethics & Philosophical Dilemmas; Prevention & Wellness; Intro to World Medical Systems. Planning and Implementation In the early planning stages for the School of Undergraduate Studies (SUS) , interviews were conducted with a cross -section of experienced NUNM faculty representative of each of our graduate programs in NWCCU Year Seven Report 24 2/7/17 Preface naturopathic medicine, Chinese medicine, and integrative medical research. F aculty were asked to describe qualities and skill sets they considered ideal in candidates for NUNM graduate and medical programs. Faculty feedback ranged from courses in which they wished students had stronger backgrounds (for example, biochemistry, botan y) to skills of behavioral maturity, critical thinking, knowledge integration, quantitative literacy, and articulateness in spoken and written communication, all skills that faculty considered were increasingly under -developed in the current generation of students. Externally we talked with more than \u00bd dozen local institutions concerning their undergraduate programs, including potential AA/AS feeder programs, for guidance in the development of our own undergraduate degrees. In addition, we surveyed currentl y enrolled NUNM students to ask how interested they would have been to complete their undergraduate degree or their science pre -requisite courses at NUNM if this option had been available to them. Also utilized in program development was information gather ed by the president of NUNM through focus groups, information seminars, and presentations for students, faculty , and administration at 11 institutions of higher education, both in Oregon and across the country. His goal was to provide information about NU NM and to gather data about interest in current programs and possible new directions. The School of Undergraduate Studies admitted its first cohort s in fall 2016. All classes are on campus, with the exception of Organic Chemistry lab, which is offered in spring quarter and will utilize the facilities of Portland State University, per our agreement with them. The PSU campus is approximately one mile walking distance from the NUNM campus. Our original budget projections anticipated 26 incoming students wi th 13 in each degree program. We met our goal, with a total of 27 students. Approximately 2/3 of the entering class came from Oregon with the remainder from Colorado, Texas, Washington, Alaska, California, Connecticut, Florida, and New Mexico.

Dr. Dallmann went on maternity leave April 4 with anticipated return of July and worked closely with interim leadership for the program, Chelsie Falk, ND, a faculty member within our School of Research and NWCCU Year Seven Report 25 2/7/17 Preface Graduate Studies. Dr. Falk served in this role throughout spring quarter. Dr. Dallmann gave notice in June that she would not return from maternity leave and Cheryl Miller, AVP of student affairs/dean of students, was appointed interim dean as of July 1 and served until D ecember 10, 2016. The recently hired director of student life and conduct and other members of the Student Affairs team temporarily assumed some of AVP Miller's responsibilities during the interim appointment. We began a national search for a founding dea n of the School of Undergraduate Studies in summer 2016 that resulted in the appointment of Dr. Tim Irving , DC, MS, effective December 10, 2016. Dr. Irving holds a Master' s in N utrition in addition to a Doctorate in Chiropractic M edicine and is a licensed massage therapist. He previously was a full -time ND faculty member holding the rank of associate professor and officially assumed his new role after completing his teaching assignments for fall quarter. Dr. Irving is well prepar ed for this promotion. From 2010 to 2016 he served as co -chair of the ND physical medicine curriculum and led faculty in the restructuring of that curriculum, and from 2010 to 2012 served as curriculum coordinator for the redrafting of the ND nutrition cur riculum. Dr. Irving was elected to serve as chair of the university's Faculty Senate and, as a result, has a strong working relationship with faculty across disciplines at NUNM. He continued to serve as Faculty Senate Chair until December, 2016, w hen he m oved to his dean role. To keep his medical skills current , Dr. Irving is continuing his teaching rotations in the NUNM Health Center. Other staffing changes in preparation for our new undergraduate students , as well as the expanding needs of our student body , include a number of changes within the Office of Student Life : In spring 2015, NUNM appointed an intercultural engagement and support manager dedicated to advisement of cultural minority and international students. During summer 2015, an academic ad visor was hired to augment services provided by the associate dean of academic progress, and academic advising was relocated to the Office of Student Life. In fall 2015, a student activities and events coordinator was hired. In fall 2015, we opened a Te sting Center, which serves students who need to make up exams due to excused absences as well as the increasing number of students with accommodations requiring extended time and/or reduced distraction for taking exams. In January 2016, we appointed a director of student life and conduct, who oversees the day -to-day operations of the Student Life Office, the student honor code, conduct processes and adjudication, conflict resolution, college events, student activities, organizations and programs, and st udent support services. This position frees the AVP of student affairs to provide higher level planning and oversight of this division of the institution. With the retirement in January 2016 of the associate dean of academic progress, the former director of student life applied/was hired for the newly created position of director of academic success and access, which replaced the associate dean role. This position oversees academic advising, tutoring, coordination of faculty advising, the Testing Center, an d disability services. Having a separate Center for Academic Success within the larger Student Life suite offers a more cohesive process for support of students in all degree programs. In June 2016, an assistant director of counseling services (.75 FTE) w as appointed to expand staffing of the counseling center, which, since its establishment in 2010, has provided free individual, couple, and group counseling services to students. For AY 2016 -17, the assistant to the dean of the College of Naturopathic Me dicine is also providing administrative assistance to the dean of the School of Undergraduate Studies. The administrative NWCCU Year Seven Report 26 2/7/17 Preface assistant is located in the suite occupied by both of these deans. The budget request for AY 2017 - 18 includes .75 FTE administrative s upport dedicated to the School of Undergraduate Studies. Activities of the NUNM Center for Career Development are expanded to include tracking of one - year-past-graduation placement and income data of graduates and use of this data in counseling students. We have student peer tutors already in place for the areas of writing/composition and reading comprehension. In addition, funding is available for professional subject matter experts to tutor undergraduate students in writing and math. To date, no underg raduate students have requested tutoring in either of these areas, nor have faculty referred a student for these services. We anticipate the first identified need will be spring 2017 when we offer Advanced Writing and Self Reflective Skills, Intercultural Communication , and Analytical Business Development. Faculty members or external professional tutors will be used as needed in these two areas. Previously composed of one director and two financial aid counselors, the Office of Financial Aid now reports to the associate vice president of student affairs and has been reconfigured. In January 2016, one of the financial aid counselors was promoted to assistant director of financial aid to support the increased administrative oversight that would be needed in th is department with the expansion to include undergraduate awards. With the departure of one of the counselors, we hired an undergraduate financial aid counselor, with a total FTE of 3.0 for this department. In 2014 this office had an FTE of 2.5. This i ncrease of .5 FTE was budgeted to sustain program expansions, including the new undergraduate degrees. Some of the activities of this department in the last two academic years in preparation for the introduction of undergraduate degrees and other institut ional expansions include: Submittal of an amendment to the university's Application to Participate in Federal Title IV Programs (Program Participation Agreement) with the U.S. Department of Education to add the Bachelor of Science in Integrative Health S ciences and Bachelor of Science in Nutrition, with approval to award Federal T4 Aid received 11/1/2015; Installation of EDExpress DOE Software for award packaging and establishment of electronic awards for students; Redesign of the NUNM website for Undergr aduate and Graduate Aid to include undergraduate regulations and policies, creation of new undergraduate policies for the financial aid department per DOE regulations, and training of staff in these new policies; Creation of an FAQ; Transitioning VA Certif ications to the Registrar's Office; Set up of a contractual agreement with Oregon Student Assistance Commission -OR Gov. ACH/EFT Agreement for Oregon Opportunity Grant; Pell Grant Training; training in use of new software (NextGen TimesheetX Software and P olicyStat software); training in the Americans with Disabilities Act in Accessibility on Campus; Federal Title IV Aid Trainings including Cash Management, Best Practices in Verification & Unusual Reporting, Protecting Student Information, continued trainin g in EDExpress Financial Aid Software, and 150% Subsidized Loan Limits; training with OSAC web grant certification; Oregon State Scholarship Commission Web Training. Library Subject matter in the undergraduate programs is very similar to some of the subj ects taught in NUNM's maste r and doctorate level courses: health, basic sciences, nutrition, wellness, cultural competency, ethics, NWCCU Year Seven Report 27 2/7/17 Preface and research. While the subjects are similar, undergraduate students will find less use from graduate -level resources. As su ch, we are supplementing our collection with resources appropriate for undergraduate students. Because of the similarities in subjects being taught, resources for the undergraduate program create greater depth in our collection rather than greater breadth. We also are purchasing texts for subjects not already held in our collection such as physics, organic chemistry and English composition, to name a few. We are committed to purchasing all required and most recommended textbooks for courses, utilizing listings of texts from our SONIS database. In addition, faculty are using some open educational resources, which do not impact the library budget. Our materials/books budget was $14,000 for AY 2015 -16 and was increased to $15,000 for 2016 -17 to accommodate the first year of undergraduate needs. The budget for AY 2015 -16 included an increase in staffing hours in preparation for program growth and expanded services. The evening/weekend supervisor position increased from 30 to 32 hours per week starting 7/1/201 5. The university piloted Sunday hours in 2014 and, based upon a gate count of weekend library use, in 2015 -16 expanded its library hours to Sundays. The library is currently open 80 hours per week (Monday -Thursday, 7 am to 9 pm; Friday, 7 am to 6 pm; Sat urday, 9 am to 5 pm; and Sunday noon to 5 pm) during the academic year, with a library staff person on duty during all open hours. We do not anticipate needing additional library space to accommodate this small student group. Faculty All faculty members are conventionally qualified to teach in NUNM's undergraduate programs, possessing a terminal degree in their field or a minimum of a master's degree in the field in which they will be teaching. The 2016 -17 course catalog documents faculty who had been c ontracted to teach in the current academic year as of its publication date. An updated list of faculty within the School of Undergraduate Studies for 2016 -17 and their credentials will be available on campus. In accordance with our faculty hiring processes , position descriptions were posted for all available teaching positions. Hiring processes began in winter quarter 2016 and continued in the current academic year. Recruitment efforts are made via internal job postings, the NUNM website, the Oregonian clas sifieds, professional association websites, the NUNM alumni newsletter and email, websites of other institutions , the Inside Higher Education website, and Craigslist. With several major universities in the area located close to NUNM, such as PSU and OHSU, we have been able to recruit well -qualified candidates for teaching undergraduate courses. The majority of undergraduate faculty identified are existing NUNM faculty, including faculty from the Master of Science in Nutrition program, who are well -qualifie d to teach nutrition courses at the undergraduate level. Our current doctor of naturopathic medicine faculty as well as master and doctorate in Chinese medicine are also ideal candidates to teach both the integrative health science and nutrition science co urses. Impact on the Institution of the Addition of the BS Programs The changes described above under Adequacy of Administrative, Faculty, Financial, Library, and Facilities Support for the Program's Objectives have benefited the entire student population. Adjunct faculty from graduate and first professional degree progra ms have applied for faculty positions in our undergraduate programs, expanding their commitment to our community. Aside from a lab that will be located on the Portland State University campus , our registrar has been successful in scheduling the classes fo r these new undergraduate programs within our existing facilities, although a recommendation was made under the update of the School of Research and Graduate Studies that an additional classroom is identified and converted for the coming academic year. Our Student Government Association prepared in the 2015 -16 academic year for the arrival of undergraduate students including the creation of SGA elected positions from our new undergraduate population. The curricula developed for our undergraduate programs is designed to prepare students who w ish to pursue our firs t professional degree or graduate programs, and we expect some to apply to our other programs. NWCCU Year Seven Report 28 2/7/17 Preface Evidence of Program Effectiveness Assessment processes for the School of Undergraduate Studies (SUS) have been incorporated into NUNM's ongoing assessment plan, which is integrated with our strategic planning processes. Examples of ongoing assessments include our cultural climate surveys of students and employees, student input as they progress through t he program as measured through the annual student satisfaction survey, and end of term faculty and course evaluations. SUS faculty are members of the Faculty Senate, and each SUS student is a voting member of the university's Student Government Associatio n. In fall quarter two SGA representatives were elected by students in the undergraduate degree programs; the SGA is a formal source of input into all issues of concern by the student body. An undergraduate program faculty member was appointed to serve on the Program and Curriculum Review Committee. There is a slot on this committee for a student elected from this School, although the position has not yet been filled . This longstanding committee provides a formal student and faculty forum for input and c ommunication into curriculum revisions and reform. At graduation students will provide program specific input through the graduating student exit survey and will be supported toward job placement. Placement data will be tracked by the NUNM Center for Car eer Development. As with our graduate and first professional degree programs, alumni surveys will capture input specific to their degree programs. SUS students become part of our ongoing tracking processes in support of programmatic and institutional asse ssment such as the newly implemented academic e arly alert system and our established processes that track student progress, separation, and leave of absence data. During fall 2016 term, the interim program dean met with the undergraduate students at two f eedback forums designed to identify time sensitive issues. The interim program dean and the new founding program dean have taken the information from these focus groups and have begun addressing concerns with departments on campus, including admissions, fi nancial aid, and career services. For example, from the focus groups, it was ascertained that students desire additional guidance early in the admissions process to create a seamless transfer from other institutions to NUNM. Students indicated that they w ere not clear during the admissions process on procedures for determining transfer credits. As a result of this input, the Office of Admissions has developed a guide summarizing the transfer process. Currently transfer credit is done manually. As a result of student feedback, NUNM is developing an electronic system that facilitates the ability of students to review their transfer credit. Similarly, since launch of the undergraduate degree programs, the interim dean has conducted three faculty meetings i n addition to meeting one -on-one with faculty for ongoing feedback. In these interactions faculty also indicated a need for more guidance to applicants regarding admissions processes. (Meeting notes are available on campus). Students provided end -of-term evaluations of faculty and courses the last two weeks of fall quarter 2016. Individual evaluations of the job performance for each faculty member that include teaching effectiveness and achievement of other job responsibilities will be held in early win ter quarter. As with all employee evaluations, faculty evaluations include professional development and the desire/need for the incorporation of any new skills. Towards assessing and improving our admissions process, we are looking at each applicant's foundation in the natural sciences and collecting data to aid us in determining whether this is a mark of future success at NUNM. We have GPA data for one entering class, the cohort that matriculated in fall 2016. We will continue collecting information a nd looking at student performance to determine the appropriate standards for this population. In addition, NUNM practices a holistic application review process, evaluating academic preparedness and overall fit for the program. Each course has been mapped to the overall program outcomes with specific objectives and competencies created per course. Syllabi delineate the manner in which achievement of competencies is measured for NWCCU Year Seven Report 29 2/7/17 Preface individual courses. We will continue to develop and refine measures of the succe ss of the new programs in meeting their outcomes. One of the goals of our two undergraduate programs is to prepare students for academic success who wish to pursue graduate or first profess ional degree programs at NUNM. Toward this goal, the interim pro gram dean met with the AVP of enrollment management, interim provost, deans of the other NUNM degree programs, and lead faculty of the basic sciences department in our ND program to discuss the current competencies of courses within the undergraduate progr ams. Some suggestions were made to the content of our organic chemistry, physics, and immunology classes , and changes will be incorporated into these courses. RESPONSE TO YEAR THREE NWCCU RECOMMENDATIONS 1. The evaluation committee recommends that the Board of Directors formally approve the institution's academic freedom policy (Standard 2.A.27). The NWCCU Year Three evaluation site visit in April 2014 determined that there was no direct evidence that the board had approved the institution's academic freedom policy. The provost recalled that the policy was develope d under the direction of Dr. James Miller, president from 1989 -1993. The board, at its next available meeting in June 2014, formally approved its long -standing academic freedom policy: \"NUN M faculty and students are free to question, discover, and test all knowledge appropriate to their discipline as judged by the academic community in general.\" (See appendix 0.4 board meeting minutes June 2014) 2. The annual Board Self -Evaluation Survey in cludes question #33: \"The board reviews the institution's projected three -year financial plan annually.\" However, the College does not produce a future -looking financial projection. Given the $4.5M and $4.7M debt obligations that are coming due in 2016 a nd 2018, respectively, and given the Board's expectation to review the institution's projected three year financial plan on an annual basis as expressed in its annual Board Self -Assessment survey, the evaluation committee recommends that NCNM produce and p rovide the board with an annual financial projection that includes a breakout of revenue, expenses, endowment draw, capital outlays, debt payments, cash flow and cash reserve (Standard 2.F.1). The Board Finance C ommittee discussed the desirability of a multi -year financial plan and concluded that such a plan, although useful, would not be accurate in future years based on the rapid and continued growth the university has been experiencing. As a test, the committe e looked at projections contained in the previous self-study and found that the numbers were off by more than 20%, and thus not predictive going forward. In October 2014, the board reviewed the institution's debt load and decided against any new debt be fore the clinic lease purchase agreement was negotiated in 2016. In late fall 2015, in anticipation of the agreement coming due, the university reviewed all of its long term debt obligations with its banks and solicited an RFP to achieve the best possible debt structure in light of its obligations and capital needs for the next 3 -5 years. The university selected Pacific Continental Bank to assemble a new SNAP bond with the State of Oregon in the amount of $13M which consolidated all of our existing debt of $11M at a substantially low er interest rate and yielded $2M for capital improvements. The new loan reduced the amount of interest by $101,000 per year. Now that the u niversity has rescheduled its debt over a 25 year period with steady monthly payments, the need to demonstrate capacity to pay large balloon payments has been satisfied. NWCCU Year Seven Report 30 2/7/17 Preface As part of the annual budget process, a business plan is produced which does document sources of revenue, expenses, debt payment s, cash flow and cash reserves (available on site). During 2016, the board developed a new endowment policy which requires the board to determine endowment draw at its February meeting. (See appendix 0.5.) CREDIT HOUR POLICY NUNM awards credits based upon hours of instruction per quarter. Fall, win ter, and spring quarters are defined as 12 weeks; summer quarter is defined as 11 weeks. One credit is defined as 12 lecture contact hours plus 24 hours of work outside of class per quarter; or 24 laboratory contact hours per quarter + 12 hours of work ou tside of class per quarter; or 24 clinical contact hours per quarter + 12 hours of work outside of class per quarter. Course requirements, including grading criteria, are provided by each faculty member on individual course syllabi. In spring 2013, uti lizing the student quarterly course evaluation process, NUNM began capturing data from students regarding the amount of time spent studying outside of each course that quarter. This process has been continued on a quarterly basis, and the data, combined wi th faculty input concerning the amount and approximate completion time of outside work required per course syllabi, informs curricula reform processes. PUBLICATION POLICY NUNM's Three Year Self -Evaluation Report of March 2014, the NWCCU Evaluation Report of June 2014 , and this Year Seven Comprehensive Self -Evaluation Report are posted on our website accreditation page, in accord ance with NWCCU's public notification policy . NWCCU's recommended statement regarding our accreditation status is used i n its entirety in the catalog, on the website, and in other publications where the institution's accreditation status is referenced. GRIEVANCE POLICY The student grievance policy is included in Section 15 of the student handbook and discussed in detail on pages 120 -121. The handbook is also posted on the website. NWCCU Year Seven Report 31 2/7/17 Standard One - Mission and Core Themes STANDARD ONE - MISSION AND CORE THEMES ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS 2 AND 3 2. AUTHORITY NUNM is authorized by the State of Oregon, HECC Office of Degree Authorization, to offer and confer degrees through oversight of the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities. Pursuant to Oregon House Bill 2117, passed in 2011, the Office of Degree Authorization has issued a separate license to grant degrees to each school that meets the requirements for exemption from ongoing evaluation by their office \"by virtue of meeting the conditions for this exemption as set forth in statute ORS 348 -597(2)(d) which states that regulation does not extend to a school, or separately accredited campus of a school, if the school: 1. Is a nonprofit school that is exempt from federal income tax under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code; 2. Conferred d egrees in this state under the same control for at least five consecutive years; and 3. Is accredited by a regional accrediting association or its national successor.\" As an independent university in Oregon that has met the conditions stated here above, a l icense was issued to NUNM to grant degrees in the state of Oregon. This license shall remain in effect as long as NUNM continues to meet the conditions listed above. See appendix 1.1 3. MISSION AND CORE THEMES The mission of NUNM is \"to educate and train physicians, practitioners and pre -professionals in the art, science and research of natural medicine\". Three Core Themes that provide further definition of the mission statement were formally adopted by the NUNM Board: Supporting Student Success - suppor t successful learning; Teaching and Learning - deliver education that ensures student achievement of competencies within the art and science of natural medicine practice and research; and Professional Vitality - promote the success of our graduates through our academic, clinical, and research endeavors. The institution currently offers these degrees: Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine (ND); Doctor of Science in Oriental Medicine (DSOM); Master of Science in Oriental Medicine (MSOM); Master of Science in Integrative Medicine Research (MsiMR); Master of Science in Nutrition (MScN); Master of Science in Global Health (MScGH); Master of Science in Integrative Mental Health (MSiMH); and approved but not yet implemented a Master of Science in Sports Medicine. Effective fall 2016, NUNM welcomed its first undergraduate cohorts for a Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and a Bachelor of Science in Integrative Health. Virtually all revenues generated at NUNM are budgeted and expended for the purpose of the education, research, and patient care activities required by its mission statement. Institutional policies preclude the use of funds for unbudgeted expenditures unle ss approved by the appropriate board and executive o fficers. Such policies ensure the utilization of institutional resources solely for the advancement of the mission of the institution . Bylaws preclude the board of d irectors from receiving compensa tion for their services on the b oard. STANDARD 1.A. MISSION NUNM Mission Statement: T o educate and train physicians, practitioners, and pre-professionals in the art, science, and research of natural medicine. The board holds the u ltimate responsibility for the NUNM mission statement. The statement is posted throughout campus and documented within the univers ity catalog (page 1) and on 32 2/7/17 Standard One - Mission and Core Themes All institutional planning including the Key Progre ss Indicators (KPIs) of our Framework for Action originates with the NUNM mission, vision, and core values. Accordingly, the mission statement for NUNM is a regular topic of board pl anning retreats. If the board, in its ongoing discussions, believes that the mission would benefit from revision in guiding the direction of the institution, it initiates a review process. The most recent community review took place in fall 2010 and was fo rmally approved at the Ju ne 2011 plenary meeting after a participatory review process that included students, facu lty, staff, and the full board. Similar processes were followed in 2004 -05 for the mission revision approved in 2005. (1.A.1) The prior missi on statement - To educate and train physicians and practitioners in the art and science of natural medicine - was revised in 2011 to reflect programmatic and institutional expansion in research activities. The addition of pre-professionals was indicative of the institutional decision to develop undergraduate degree programs that support the core medical programs of the institution, as well as our movement toward university status, which u nder Oregon Administrative Rule 583 -030-0016, is a te rm reserved for institutions authorized to offer bachelor together with graduate or first professional degrees . (1.A.1) The 2010 -11 mission review was preceded by a review that began in 2008 of examining and aligning NUNM 's purpose, vision, values , and mi ssion . The rationale of this process was to create an Alignment Model (see next page) that ensures consistency, congruency, clarity, and effective communication, decision-making, and problem solving . The model , which continues to guide the institution, has an upper and lower level, similar in shape to an hourglass . (1.A.2) In the upper level (the purview of the board) are the overarching product, purpose, vision, and values of the institution . 1. The Product of our Product is: HealThySelf (or Healthy Sel f). 2. The purpose statement is: \"Promote and exemplify health, sustainable living, and self -healing through education, research, and service.\" 3. The NUNM vision is: \"NUNM is the known leader in natural medicine education.\" 4. Below the vision are the institutional values: respect, integrity, creativity/innovation, commitment, and excellence. The lower level is the realm of NUNM 's Schools and Colleges, administrative committees, councils, teams , and departments. The mission and the strategies to accomplish the mission are in the lower level of the hourglass . (1.A.2) This model includes the premise that in order to solve a problem, one needs to use a higher level of thinking than that which caused the problem. In order to re solve an issue, it is addressed in a higher level of the alignment model than where the issue is occurring. (1.A.2) NWCCU Year Seven Report 33 2/7/17 Standard One - Mission and Core Themes In the planning processes that led to NUNM's Year One Report, four Core Themes were identified with corresponding objectives and indicators. The themes were based upon concepts utilized by the board in planning, centered in four key areas: people, progra ms, finance, and facilities. Based on NWCCU feedback on the Year One Report, the Steering Committee, in preparation for the Year Three Report, and with input from the Academic Affairs Committee of the board and full board approval, redrafted the themes, objectives, and indicators. Three Core Theme s (and supportive objectives and indicators) were created to provide greater specificity to the mission of the institution and in support of the NUNM strategic plan. The graphic below provides a pictorial overvie w of the Core Themes and objectives derived from these themes. (1.A.2) NWCCU Year Seven Report 34 2/7/17 Standard One - Mission and Core Themes Student Success Teaching and Learning NUNM Mission: To educate and train physicians, practitioners and pre -professionals in the art, science and research of natural medicine O b j e c t i v e s C o r e T h e m e s Support successful learning Student Success Deliver education that ensure s student achievement of competencies within the art and science of natural medicine practice and research Teaching and Learning Promote the success of our graduates through our academic, clinical, and research endeavors Professional Vitality Ensure standards for admission result in matriculation of students who are academically and non -academically prepared for the rigors of medical school, graduate school, and undergraduate degrees Foster systems that support student success Ensure the curricula retain the classical roots of their medicines Deliver outcomes based curricula that ensure that all graduates achieve the minimum competency standards Prepare students to engage in scholarly interaction with other professionals & support the free exchange of ideas, respectful debate, & other exercises of intellectual curiosity Prepare and support our graduates to work within the professions for which they are trained Provide support to faculty in improvi ng their teaching skills STANDARD 1.B. CORE THEMES NWCCU Year Seven Report 35 2/7/17 Standard One - Mission and Core Themes An appended document , Core Theme Achievement Narrative ( appendix 0.1), was created to supplement the five Standards and includes an overview of each Core Theme, objective, and indicator, including accumulated data and rationale for selection of indicators. With the implementation of new degree programs since the Year Three R eport, several indicators specific to the new programs were added, and the wording on objective one of Core Theme One was modified for the same reason. This self -evaluation recommends modifications to some indicators for the next seven year cycle and are i ncluded in the Recommendation section, as well as within appendix 0.1 and within the standards. The three tables below expand details from the graphic above to include the indicators chosen for each objective. CORE THEME ONE: SUPPORT STUDENT SUCCESS Objectives Indicators Ensure standards for admission result in matriculation of students who are academically and non - academically prepared for the rigors of medical school, graduate school, and undergraduate degrees. (This objective was modified to include graduate school and undergraduate degrees.) Accepted applicants into its medical programs within the Colleges of Naturopathic and Classical Chinese Medicine meet or exceed targeted non -cognitive admissions criteria. (Additional program specific indicators were added for new programs in the last three years). Accepted applicants meet or exceed targeted GPA standards for admission. Foster systems that support student success. Student satisfaction with targeted support services meets or exceeds specified thresholds. Student attrition data each year is 5% or less. (This is also a mission fulfillment indicator.) CORE THEME TWO: TEACHING AND LEARNING . DELIVER EDUCATION THA T ENSURES STUDENT ACHIE VEMENT OF COMPETENCI ES WITHIN THE ART AND SCIENC E OF NATURAL MEDICIN E PRACTICE AND RESEA RCH Provide support to faculty in improving their teaching skills. Faculty report an average score of 4 or higher (on a Likert scale of 1 - 5) on post -seminar surveys to the following 2 questions: Have your skills or knowledge increased as a result of the seminar? Will you be able to apply what you learned to your classroom or clinical teaching? Deliver outcomes based curricula that ensure that all graduates achieve the minimum competency standards. Indicators for student achievement within School of Research and Graduate Studies (SoRGS) were developed since Year Three Report. MScN Pass rates on case based final project. 80% of students pass with a grade of 80% the first time. 75% warnin g threshold. MScGH Passing written and oral presentation of practical fieldwork project. 80% of students pass with a grade of 80% the first time. 75% of students passing warning threshold. MSiMH NWCCU Year Seven Report 36 2/7/17 Standard One - Mission and Core Themes Clinical entrance: 80% threshold, first time pass rate; red flag at 70%. Clinical exit exams.90% threshold, and 80% red flag. MSiMR Student pass rate of first oral defense. 90% student pass rate; warning threshold 80%. Indicators for student achievement within the first professional degree programs of the Colleges of NUNM: (Both of these indicators are also used as indicators for mission fulfillment.) First-time pass rates on clinical entrance and exit exams: 85% success threshold, 70% warning threshold. First-time pass rates in each category for the NPLEX (ND) and NCCAOM (AOM) examinations: 90% success threshold, 75% warning threshold. Ensure the curricula retain the classical roots of their medicines. Mean responses for targeted questions in annual exit surveys meet or exceed specific thresholds. (This is also an indicator for mission fulfillment. Also note that this is an area in which several program specific indicators were added for new programs si nce the Year Three Report.) CORE THEME THREE : PROFESSIONAL VITALITY PROMOTE THE SUCCESS O F OUR GRADUATES THRO UGH OUR ACADEMIC , CLINICAL , AND RESEARCH ENDEAVORS Prepare and support our graduates to work within the professions for which they are trained. Alumni placement data: Percentage of responding alumni who report they are employed in a field directly related to their NUNM degree. Alumni perception of how well NUNM prepared them for a career in their profession. Target: 90% of respondents respond \"adequately\" or better. (This is also an indicator for mission fulfillment.) Continuing Education Offerings for the two medical colleges of NUNM Increase the number of continuing education attendees who are NUNM alumni by 5% annually for the next three years. Increase online continuing education offerings (to include live webinars and recorded seminars) by 10% annually for the next three years. NWCCU Year Seven Report 37 2/7/17 Standard One - Mission and Core Themes Prepare students to engage in scholarly interaction with other professionals and support the free exchange of ideas, respectful debate, and other exercises of intellectual curiosity. Advance the exposure to scholarly research and Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) on campus. Indicators: >80% of students believe that they are proficient in reading researc h literature and interpreting study findings. >80% of students believe they are able to use online databases to access medical literature. Students design and conduct research. Indicators: Percentage of students who are designing and conducting research. 100% of MSIMR students. 5% of all NUNM students. Community members are encouraged to engage in the free exchange of ideas, respectful debate, and other exercises of intellectual curiosity . Indicator : Each of the schools that offer first professional degree programs (ND and CCM) will offer one forum each quarter. SoRGS: Provide a Speaker Series that ensures that the educational content of each program within the School is supported by a m inimum of one presentation per quarter. (Revised from: Each of the programs within the School of Research and Graduate Studies will offer one forum each quarter. ) Six indicators in support of Core Theme objectives were identified to reflect mission fulfillment success in educa tion and training of physicians, practitioners, and pre -professionals in the art, science, and research of natural medicine. Each of these six indicators are measurable, and data ha ve been tracked and used to inform mission fulfillment: Student attrition data First-time pass rates on cli nical entrance and exit exams for students in the first professional degree programs First-time pass rates for graduates of the first professional degree programs fo r the NPLEX (Naturopathic Medicine) and NCCAOM (Acupuncture and Herbal Medicine) examinations Mean responses for specificall y targeted questions in program -level annual exit surveys with questions designed toward understanding the level to which the curricula retain the class ical roots of their medicines Percentage of alumni who report they are employed in a field directly related to their NUNM degree Alumni perception of how well NUNM prepared them for a career in their profession . (Please refer to Standard Three and to appendix 0.1 for detailed discussion .) NUNM requires each degree program to map programmatic competencies and track those competencies to the course level, and this process has been completed for all degree p rograms currently being offered, with the exception of the ND program. The ND program is in its second year of rolling out a curriculum redesign NWCCU Year Seven Report 38 2/7/17 Standard One - Mission and Core Themes of its four year program, and this mapping is a work in progr ess for some courses not yet offered . In addition , the ND program map connects the blueprint for the national licensure exam to material covered at a course level. Mapping of degree program competencies to the course level provides specific, measurable activities related to student learning that can b e and are used to assess programmatic success and mission fulfillment. Please refer to Standard Four for further discussion. NWCCU Year Seven Report 39 2/7/17 Standard Two - Resources and Capacity STANDARD TWO - RESOURCES AND CAPACITY ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS 4 THOUGH 21 4. OPERATIONAL FOCUS AND INDEPENDENCE NUNM is a medical university first and foremost. This mandate is dictated by our Bylaws (Appendix 2.1). As such, a ll of NUNM's programs and services are predominantly concerned with higher education. Our campus clinics, community clinics, and SIBO (s mall intestinal bacterial overgrowth) Center provide medical care and associated services such as labs and medicinaries and were designed and are operated as teaching clinics that meet the educational needs of our students and the medical needs of our community. NUNM Press, our internal publishing company, was created to provide a reliable source of medical literature, scholarship and research related to natur al medicine and holistic health systems. The NUNM Store holds products of interest to or needed by our students, faculty, and staff. Our Institutes include NUNM's Helfgott Research Institute , a professionally independent, non -profit research institute who se mission is to conduct rigorous, high quality, research on the art and science of healing, specifically working to understand natural forms of medicine. Together, scientists from the fields of naturopathic medicine, Chinese medicine, acupuncture, immunol ogy, and nutrition apply their expertise to the study of natural medicine. Other Institutes, Age Wise, Food as Medicine, Traditional Roots, and Women in Balance, are housed under the Office of Advancement, Continuing Education and Alumni Affairs and offer community education, not -for-credit, classes that provide samples of our medicines for the general public. NUNM operates as an independent, not -for-profit university and protects its interests with institutions and organizations with which we work, such as our community clinics and research partners, with appropriate contracts. 5. NON-DISCRIMINATION NUNM prohibits discrimination on the basis of age, sex, race, national or ethnic origin, religion or disability, or veteran's status in any of its policies , procedures or practices. NUNM also complies with Oregon state discrimination laws that prohibit discrimination for sexual orientation, marital status, gender identity and family relationship. NUNM's nondiscrimination policy covers admission and access to , and treatment and employment in university programs and activities, including but not limited to academic admissions, financial aid, educational services and employment. Title IX prohibits gender -based harassment, which may include acts of verbal, nonver bal, or physical aggression, intimidation, or hostility based on sex or sex - stereotyping, even if those acts do not involve conduct of a sexual nature. The dean of students has been designated to handle inquiries regarding NUNM's Title IX policies and proc edures. NUNM adheres to guidelines set forth by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) and the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which pertain to limitations and rights of access to student records (FERPA ) and patient -protected health information (HIPAA). To ensure compliance with these requirements, NUNM enacts policies and procedures, and articulates protocols in the catalog, the student handbook, departmental policy and procedural guides, and employee h andbook. 6. INSTITUTIONAL INTEGRITY Personal and institutional integrity inform our operational systems, setting priorities and interaction with colleagues and the community. The Faculty Senate, Student Government Association, and the Staff Council are actively engaged in providing input to and in communicating policy. This participation has helped to ensure fairness in dealing with all campus constituencies. Complaint and grievance procedures for students are outlined in the Student Handbook. NUNM is c ommitted to humane and nondiscriminatory policies and practices for staff and faculty. Equal opportunity policies of nondiscrimination, immigration compliance and reasonable accommodation are outlined in NUNM's employee handbook. The university is commit ted to protecting the health and safety of its workforce. For this purpose there are policies and procedures that set forth the standards of conduct, protect rights, and ensure nondiscriminatory practices. NUNM in policy provides employees with all rights NWCCU Year Seven Report 40 2/7/17 Standard Two - Resources and Capacity required by law and in practice often works with its employees beyond rights provided by law. An example might be extending leave of absence for family and/or medical reasons beyond the 12 -week leave/year, if necessary, and, if possible, without detriment to the institution. The Human Resources Office has an open door policy and actively pursues ensuring fairness and nondiscriminatory practices in recruitment, employment issues, and compensation. NUNM's Marketing and Communications Department and indiv idual team members strive for professionalism in every aspect of their work, always remembering the department's responsibilities of producing accurate, timely and appealing results that advance the university's standing in the professional and public rega rd. Publications, website, and other communication tools are assessed for effectiveness, appeal and functionality on an ongoing basis. 7. GOVERNING BOARD The NUNM Board of Directors is the governing body of the institution, and in accordance with its Byl aws exercises ultimate authority over the institution. The board is responsible for setting the direction of the business and academic -related affairs of the university, including establishing broad policy, long -range planning, appointment and evaluation o f the president, ensuring financial stability including the review and approval of the annual budget, supporting the president and other administrators in the development of external relations, and approving major degree program changes. A board of regents , per the Bylaws, advises the president and board of directors on matters such as fundraising, conditions and trends in the national health care landscape, public policy, trends in higher education locally, federally, and regionally, state-based issues and events, and planning. To prevent undue outside influence, and in compliance with Oregon Administrative Rule 583 -030-0035, each board member annually signs a conflict of int erest disclosure statement per B oard Bylaws, IV. 12 (appendix 2.1 ). Also see th e board policy regarding conflict of interest (appendix 2.2). Signed disclosure statements are obtained from each board member at the November meeting and are tracked and maintained by the Office of the President. This policy prohibits any board member fro m taking actions that could constitute a conflict of interest, and provides a procedure for recusal in the event of a potential conflict. 8. CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER NUNM's chief administrator, Dr. David Schleich, has served as president since 2007 and is responsible for the operations of the university and the administration of policies and procedures as set forth by the board. He serves as an ex-officio member of the board and ensures communications as appropriate between the board and the NUNM community. 9. ADMINISTRATION NUNM's administrators are appropriately qualified for and have the authority to carry out their responsibilities set forth in their position de scriptions. Organizational charts and position descriptions are clear and are available to all employees through the NUNM Intranet, facilitating employee understanding of NUNM's organizational structure. The President's Cabinet is the senior management tea m of the university, consisting of the executive vice president of finance and administration/CFO; vice president of academic affairs/provost; vice president for accreditation, assessment, and compliance, vice president of advancement, vice president of hu man resources, associate vice president of enrollment management; associate vice president of student affairs; and the president. Each of the members of the Cabinet is full - time in her/his position. Its mandate incudes monitoring university operations in the context of the five - year strategic plan created to support mission fulfillment and the clarifying Core Themes, providing guidance assuring the success of the five -year strategic plan, monitoring and maintaining the momentum of the university's annual business plan, and facilitating communication within and across departments. Policy is generally communicated through the employee, faculty, or student handbooks, which are updated periodically. In addition, the institution has implemented a software syst em which is accessible to all NWCCU Year Seven Report 41 2/7/17 Standard Two - Resources and Capacity employees that contains all institutional policies. 10. FACULTY NUNM hires fully qualified faculty, most of whom have attained the terminal degree in their field, and maintains a mix of full -time and adjunct faculty. While it remains a goal to increase the percentage of full - time faculty, the nature of the institution lends itself to a large adjunct faculty, as many practitioners enjoy teaching and do it on a long -term basis, but also consider ongoing clinical practice important. The university has a great deal of stability in the adjunct faculty population, with some m embers teaching for more than 20 years. Faculty members are encouraged to participate both formally and informally in the formulation of academic policies, practices, and program development; academic counseling of students; and student advancement and r emedial processes. Formally, faculty may choose the manner in which they satisfy their contractual obligation to serve on institutional committees such as the Curriculum Committee, Admissions Committee, Budget Committee, Faculty Development Committee, Safe ty Committee, and Academic Progress Review Committee. Informally, faculty may give input through their program dean or directly to the Office of the Provost. The university ensures that all faculty members have adequate time and resources to continue the ir education. These standards and educational opportunities help academic and clinical faculty stay abreast of current medical and educational issues. A faculty member sits on the board of directors as a non -voting member and is elected annually by the Fac ulty Senate. Full-time faculty are evaluated every year by their program dean. Course evaluations for all faculty are reviewed each quarter. If there have been questionable reviews in their classes, the program chair does class observations prior to the m eeting. Evaluation of adjunct faculty varies from every year to once every three years, depending on program. 11. EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM NUNM offers the following degrees: Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine (ND); Master of Science in Oriental Medicine (MSOM); Doctor of Science in Oriental Medicine (DSOM); Master in Acupuncture (MAc, currently being taught out); Master of Science in Integrati ve Medicine Research (MSiMR); Master of Science in Nutrition (MScN); Master of Science in Global Health (MScGH), Master of Science in Integrative Mental Health (MSiMH), and also Bachelor of Science in Integrative Health and Bachelor of Science in Nutrition , matriculating their first cohorts in fall 2016 and providing the final two years of study for undergraduate s tudents interested in pursuing careers or further training and/or research in the natural health sciences. NWCCU recently approved NUNM to offer the Master of Science in Sports Medicine, which we expect to implement in fall 2017 for concurrent students and in 2018 for stand alone. Each of these degree programs was vetted through NUNM's processes, including its curriculum committee and board for consistency with the mission of the institution. The Core Themes that clarify the mission and the supporting objectives and indicators were created in a process that included NUNM's two colleges (naturopathic medicine and classical Chinese medicine) and two schools (undergraduate studies and graduate studies). Any potential new programs are first vetted to ensure that their rigor and content are consistent with the NUNM mission and Core Themes. Each degree offered culminates in achievement of clearly id entified student learning outcomes and leads to collegiate -level degrees with degree designation consistent with program content in recognized fields of study. 12. GENERAL EDUCATION AND RELATED INSTRUCTION Until fall 2016, NUNM offered only professional graduate degrees and did not include any general education or related instruction component in its required curriculum. Admissions standards for the NWCCU Year Seven Report 42 2/7/17 Standard Two - Resources and Capacity graduate programs and the coursework leading to these degrees require that students enter NUNM with a minimum of a baccalaureate -level degree. These standards ensure that students enter with a foundation of learning skills and, consequently, the ability to benefit from these programs. As is outlined in the admissions requirements for the undergraduate degree programs, students are expected to enter the program with a minimum of 90 undergraduate quarter credits. If students have not met their general education requirements prior to matriculating into either of NUNM's undergraduate programs, students may earn an additional 29 quarter credits of general education at NUNM. NUNM general education courses support student achievement of writing and speaking skills, math, and social skills such as teamwork, intercultural competency and critical thinking. Examples of ge neral education courses offered through the undergraduate degree programs include: S elf-Care & Self -Management; Culture, Identity & Emotion; Intercultural Communication; Advanced Writing and Self -Reflective Skills, Analytical Business Development; Ethics & Philosophical Dilemmas; Prevention & Wellness; Intro to World Medical Systems. 13. LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SOURCES The library collections are diverse in terms of media, format, tactile and language -based, and web -based resources. The physical collectio n, especially the book collection, is strong and unique in many ways. The information technology infrastructure for the library serves to maximally leverage library resources. Students can access web -based resources off campus, and on campus through the NUNM wireless network and through 29 public computer workstations and 13 printers in and around the library and an additional 22 computer workstations dedicated for student use i n the computer lab . The library has also added different kinds of electronics, such as an iPad and a Kindle loaded with eBooks. Alternative medicine continues to rely heavily on print resources. Unlike conventional academic medical libraries, where print h oldings are flat or actually decreasing, the NUNM library's print holdings continue to grow along with access to electronic resources. A common method for leveraging library collections and resources is through consortial collaboration. The NUNM library i s part of the Portland Academic Health Libraries (PAHL) consortium that includes Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU), University of Western States (UWS), and Oregon College of Oriental Medicine (OCOM). This consortium shares a library automation sy stem, and members enjoy full reciprocity for circulation of materials. NUNM has established a courier system with OHSU and OCOM whereby weekly trips to each library are made in order to pick up and return materials requested by patrons from the different s chools. In the last four years, NUNM patrons have borrowed over 800 items from the other PAHL libraries, nearly half of these from OCOM. Additionally, the library participates in two national interlibrary loan systems (OCLC and NLM), and generates approxi mately 1,500 loan interactions with libraries from around the country per year. In the acquisition of new materials, the library follows its collection development policy. This policy guides us in the acquisition and retention of materials. The library directly supports program goals and student learning outcomes by acquiring required and optional texts for courses. 14. PHYSICAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL INFRASTRUCTURE NUNM's academic programs have adequate physical resources to achieve its mission and objectives. Even as the institution has invested in its future through campus expansion, there continues to be an emphasis on improving classrooms and academic facilities, enhancing safety and security, and addressing deferred maintenance backlogs. Each classroom and lecture hall is equipped with appropriate furniture and AV/instructional technology equipment. Ten classrooms are equipped with a computer and ceiling - mounted projector and screen, with the larger classroom also equipped with sound system, DVD player, and laptop connectivity for both Macintosh and PC laptops. Camtasia is installed in all classroom computers and is used to record presentations and lectures. A remote classroom is available for nursing mothers and students with chemical sensitivities to view lecture classes. Physical medicine labs are equipped with NWCCU Year Seven Report 43 2/7/17 Standard Two - Resources and Capacity massage tables, manipulation tables, skeleton models and other specialized equipment. The herb/diet lab was designed to teach botanical medicine, herbal and diet classes. It is equipped with a sink , drying racks, worktables with electrical hook -ups and other associated equipment. NUNM provides a comprehensive technical infrastructure to support the university's programs and services. This consists of 13 physical servers, 11 virtual servers, 435 c omputer workstations, and 154 printers. Workstations have the ability to print to copiers, and copiers can be used to scan paper to electronic files sent via email. Students have access to 29 public computer workstations and 13 printers in and around the NUNM Library and an additional 22 computer workstations dedicated for student use in the computer lab. The computer lab is equipped with a projector and screen that will allow the university to utilize the facility to provide training on programs such as u sage of NUNM Clinic's electronic medical records software. Seventeen classrooms are equipped with a computer and ceiling -mounted projector and screen with the larger classrooms being equipped with sound system, DVD player, and laptop connectivity for both Macintosh and PC laptops. Camtasia is installed in eight classroom computers and is used to record presentations and lectures. The college reviews and updates its Technology Plan annually ( appendix 2.3 ). It includes any needs for replacing network backbon e and edge services. Computer Purchasing and Replacement Policy (available on site) has been developed and implemented to provide guidance for the replacement of computer systems. 15. ACADEMIC FREEDOM As stated in the college catalog (page 160) and facult y handbook (page 44), \"NUNM faculty and students are free to question, discover, and test all knowledge appropriate to their discipline, as judged by the academic community in general.\" Faculty and students are accorded the freedom to teach, learn, and pursue scholarly and research interests without interference or penalty from the administration or commercial sponsors. This freedom is subject to the norms and standards of scholarly inquiry in America and relevant NUNM polic ies pertaining to faculty responsibilities and employment. On June 27, 2014, the NUNM Board of Directors formally ratified the Academic Freedom policy quoted above in satisfaction of a Recommendation from the NWCCU Year Three Evaluation Committee. (A.2. 27) The policy had been in effect for decades but no record could be found of official approval by the board. 16. ADMISSIONS NUNM has admission requirements for each of the programs, specifying academic and technical standards. These standards are include d in the college catalog, the student handbook, and in admissions publications, and are maintained by the Office of Admissions and put into practice during file review and interview processes of each candidate for entrance into the university. 17. PUBLIC INFORMATION The institution's catalog and website address all areas outlined above with the exception of student rights and responsibilities including grievance procedures, which are found in the student handbook. The student and clinic handbooks also add ress many of the same areas and expand on procedures to reinforce the policies set forth in the catalog. 18. FINANCIAL RESOURCES The Financial and Administrative Affairs Committee (FAAC) of the board meets monthly and is the board committee responsible for monitoring, refining and approving the detailed elements of the finance function, financial policies and budget activity related to plant and property, human resources, programming, financial and student services, clinic operations, ancillary business operations, and property acquisition and NWCCU Year Seven Report 44 2/7/17 Standard Two - Resources and Capacity disposal. The chief financial officer serves as an administrative representative to this c ommittee which reports directly to the board and provides written and oral reports at its quarterly meetings. The board is the final approval body on budget matters, including responsibility for property and assets of the institution, as well as long range financial plan. Any debt the institution incurs must have board approval. The board approves the annual budget and any modifications to the budget as needed and, per the terms of the Bylaws, reviews and approves the annual audit. The board receives compa rable financial data with narrative on significant variances at its regular meetings. They also receive a narrative and financial statement of how goals in the strategic plan are being achieved. 19. FINANCIAL ACCOUNTABILITY NUNM is required to hire an independent auditor to perform an annual audit of its financial statements. The audits are conducted in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards; \"Government Auditing Standards\", issued by the Comptroller of the United States; and the provis ions of Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A -133, \"Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non -Profit Organizations.\" The annual audit also reports on the compliance with requirements applicable to each major program and internal control over compliance in accordance with OMB Circular A -133 and on the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards. The financial records of the university are audited by the independent auditing firm, Hoffman, Stewart & Schmidt, P.C. The annual audit is conducted af ter the close of the fiscal year on June 30 and is reviewed by the board at its fall meeting. 20. DISCLOSURE NUNM agrees to disclose any and all information required by the Northwest Commission on Colleges to carry out the evaluation and accreditation fun ction. 21. RELATIONSHIP WITH THE ACCREDITATION COMMISSION NUNM understands and accepts the policies and standards as specified in the most recent Accreditation Handbook. The university will comply with all policies and standards as specified in this publi cation. NUNM understands and agrees to the release of information concerning the status or action taken by the Commission with regards to NUNM. STANDARD 2.A. GOVERNANCE An overview of NUNM's decision -making process is available to the NUNM community through documents such as Framework for Action , which is conceptualized in five year cycles. It is pr epared by the President's Cabinet with stakeholder consultation and produced by the Marketing Department and updated periodically. Part I: Framework for Action (pages 17 -22) descri bes the institution's governance structure, including descriptions of the university's operations and planning committee structure, and an outline of the lines of communication among the operating teams, Faculty Senate, Student Government Association, Staff Association, and committees of the Board of Directors. The president periodically is invited to committee meetings of faculty, students and staff to provide copies of the Framework and to answer questions about the document and about progress on the str ategic objectives. In addition to the committee communication and team structure, NUNM has an accompanying and more traditional hierarchical structure as illustrated in our institutional organizational charts (appendix 2.4). The Organization and Governan ce sections of the university catalog (pages 166 -172) and the student handbook (pages 16 -25) list the names and titles of the members of the Board of Directors, administration, and faculty. (2.A.1) Board representation includes four non -voting campus repr esentatives who are elected by their formal constituency bodies: faculty (1), staff (1), and students (2). Constituency representation reflects the board's NWCCU Year Seven Report 45 2/7/17 Standard Two - Resources and Capacity commitment to including input from the institution's communities of interest. In addition, students, faculty, and staff representatives can provide input into decision making processes and make recommendations through the administrative structure. The president meets regularly with the Student Government Association (SGA) and Staff Association representa tives. Academic administrators (provost and deans) attend a monthly meeting with SGA representatives. Academic administrators also attend monthly Faculty Senate meetings as guests for specific agenda items and are invited to Student Government Association meetings. (2.A.1) NUNM does not have a multi -unit governance system; 2.A.2 is not applicable. NUNM's accreditation liaison officer (ALO) monitors compliance with institutional and programmatic standards to ensure adherence to standards. The ALO oversees completion of all accreditation reports and works closely with other university departments to ensure coordination and completion of accreditation self-studies and site visits. NUNM does not have a collective bargaining system. NUNM is committed to and has dedicated resources toward protecting the members of our community, and we are unaware of an y issues or problems with the current manner in which the institution is organized and regulated that may adversely affect the institution and, to our knowledge, we are in compliance with all federal, state, and local laws and regulations. (2.A.3) Example s are provided below: Insurance (malpractice; professional liability; external event risk management checklist; protection of our students and faculty when abroad including medical and travel assistance services, accident and sickness coverage, and emergency evacuation services) Appointment of a Title IX coordinator and deputies, who regularly review our policies and procedures; trained campus investigators; mandatory annual training for employees; and contact information for the Title IX coordinator on the inside front cover of the catalog and on our website OSHA compliance monitored by an external contractor, who provides mandatory annual training for faculty and staff, as well as monitoring for OSHA building compliance in all areas Compliance with HIPAA regulations per the US Department of Civil Rights Maintenance of information on students in a secure, confidential manner in accordance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 Monitoring of the facilities to ensure that they meet A DA standards Monthly meetings of the Safety Committee comprised of representatives from all departments of the college, including student representatives, co -chaired by the CMO and the chief of security Addition of a Campus Safety Campaign to the annual tr aining schedule (such as bystander intervention, reporting of violent crimes, personal safety measures, prevention, and training related to domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence and stalking, as required by Title IX laws and the Campus SaVE (S exual Violence Elimination) Act Publication of an Annual Safety and Security Report, which includes statistics for the annual Clery report Drug screen prior to matriculation of all incoming students whose course of study will include clinical rotations or clinical field -work experience As health care workers, training for students in CPR, participation in TB surveillance, and offering the hepatitis B vaccine Retaining responsibility for ensuring that policies and procedures are followed at NUNM off - campus sites, including all community clinics GOVERNING BOARD The board is the final approval body for policy and budget matters affecting the university, and holds responsibility for the property and assets of the institution. Board committees report directly to the full board and provide reports at its meetings. The board calendar includes the dates of plenary and committee NWCCU Year Seven Report 46 2/7/17 Standard Two - Resources and Capacity meetings and is created annually. Agendas for meetings are distributed in advance. The board and its committees formally approve minutes of prior meetings. Copies of agendas and minutes are available on campus. (2.A.4) The B oard Bylaws, which delineate board officers and the committee structure, were most recently updated in June 2014. The Board Development Committee, is currently workin g on potential revisions to the Bylaws, which will come to the full board at upcoming meetings. The Bylaws mandate a minimum of nine and not more than 17 members, with the number fixed by resolution at the annual meeting. The non -voting emeritus and ex officio members and constituency representatives are in addition to voting board members. The Bylaws dictate that at least one director is a graduate of the university, at least 1/3 plus one directors hold an accredited Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine degree (in satisfaction of requirements of the State of Washington), at least one holds a degree in Chinese Medicine, and that the remaining directors are chosen from the public at large. The following social sectors are prioritized for additions to the b oard: health administration, health care professionals, higher education administration, business and industry, government policy and administration, and non -profit organizations. The draft revisions currently under discussion consider modifying the 1/3 + 1 requirement for ND representation, as the State of Washington regulation no longer applies since NUNM became a university. (2.A.4) Article IV.12 provides requirements concerning conflicts of interest and also requires that board governance policies incl ude code of conduct and ethics policies. To prevent undue outside influence, and in compliance with Oregon Administrative Rule 583 -030-0035, each board member annually signs a conflict of interest disclosure statement per B oard Bylaws, IV.12 (appendix 2.1) . Also see the board conflict of interest policy (appendix 2.2). Signed disclosure statements are obtained from each board member at the November meeting and are tracked and maintained by the Office of the President. This policy prohibits any board member from taking actions that could constitute a conflict of interest and provides a procedure for recusal in the event of a potential conflict. Three current board members have described potential for conflict of interest. Mr. Mohan Nair occasionally serves as a guest lecturer within CCM programs, Dr. Willow Moore sometimes assists one of the qigong retreats, and Mr. Don Drake sometimes serves as a real estate agent for the university, with the remainder of voting members having no contractual, financial, or e mployment interest. NUNM's president serves as a non -voting ex-officio member of the board. Board Bylaws preclude directors from receiving compensation for their services on the board. Directors are reimbursed for long - distance travel, accommodation, and meal expenses incurred in attending board meetings, provided these are approved in advance by the board. (2.A.4) NUNM's Board Bylaws and Articles of I ncorporation (appendix) delineate the authority, responsibilities, and organizational structures of the board. The board acts as a committee of the whole, with specific functions of committees clearly delineated within the B oard Bylaws. Committee meetings may occur between board meetings, but any actions must be submitted to the full board for ratification at the next board meeting. (2.A.5) The NUNM Board of Directors is the governing body of the institution, and in accordance with its Bylaws exercises ultimate authority over the institution. The board is responsible for setting the direction of the business and academic -related affairs of th e university, including establishing and approving broad policy, long-range planning, appointment and evaluation of the president, ensuring financial stability including the review and approval of the annual budget, supporting the president and other admin istrators in the development of external relations, and approving major program changes. After community participation, the board approves the university mission statement. See board policy Actions Requiring Board Approval (appendix 2.5 ). (2.A.6) See als o page 26 of the Framework for Action . The NUNM Board of Directors oversees the organization, maintenance, and development of the institution and hires the president, who heads th e university administration and to whom the board has delegated all NWCCU Year Seven Report 47 2/7/17 Standard Two - Resources and Capacity aspects of the day -to-day operations and activities of the university. The president is also responsible for fund-raising and external relations of the university and for the fulfillment o f specific yearly or multi -year goals (KPIs) determined by the board. The KPIs are outlined in the Framework for Action document . (2.A.7) The Board Development Committee (BDC), a s ubcommittee of the board, meets monthly and identifies potential new board members, conducts board orientation, development, and training, develops tools or obtains external expertise for the evaluation of the board, and reviews the Bylaws as needed and ma kes recommendations for changes to the board as a whole. The board regularly evaluates its processes and composition. The most recent were self -evaluations conducted by survey in spring 2012 and January 2014 and included four sections: Governance, Board Management, Financial, and Self -Assessment. Survey results for 2014 and 2012 in their entirety are available on site. Through this self -evaluation of their strengths and weaknesses in membership skills, the board prioritized new membership to fill weaker areas or replace skillsets of board members who are rotating off. The decision by the board to join the Association of Governing Boards of Colleges and Universities (AGB) was made to take advantage of the resources provided to member institutions, such as training in support of skill development and industry standards. Several directors attended the spring 2016 professional development conference of AGB and reported back to the board as a whole on the various AGB workshops, seminars, and lectures in which they participated. The BDC has begun planning for the next self -evaluation. (2.A.8) LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT NUNM utilizes a combination of a hierarchical management structure, as reflected by the organizational chart (appendix 2.4), with a team planning and operations mode l (see image of this model on page 49 ). The duties, responsibilities, and ethical requirements of the institution's administrators are contained within position descriptions (available in HR on site). Dr. David Schleich has ser ved full -time as NUNM's president since 2007. He is the chief executive officer of the university, is an ex officio member of the NUNM Board of Directors, and is charged by the board with the supervision, management, and direction of the affairs of the un iversity. Dr. Schleich is conventionally qualified for his position and holds a PhD in Educational Theory and Policy Studies from the University of Toronto, Canada, an MA in English Language and Literature from the University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada, a B.Ed. in Curriculum Design and Teaching Methodology from Queen's University, as well as a professional certification in teaching from the Province of Ontario. Dr. Schleich has 40 years of experience as an educator within higher education, beginning as a lecturer and moving progressively to professor, academic vice president, and seven years as president of Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine. (2.A.9 -2.A.10) NUNM's administrators are appropriately qualified, sufficient in number, and have the aut hority to carry out the responsibilities set forth in their position descriptions. Organizational charts and position descriptions are reviewed annually, and are available to all employees through the NUNM Intranet, facilitating employee understanding of t he university's organizational structure. NUNM's teams and committees foster mission accomplishment through collaboration within and across departments. The President's Cabinet (PC), the senior management team of the university, is charged with university operations in the context of the five -year strategic plan, the annual business plan, university policy, and emergent priorities. This team is composed of the president and all vice presidents and associate vice presidents. Per its mandate, the PC regularl y monitors progress toward implementation of the strategic plan. Examples of other committees supporting collaboration toward mission fulfillment include the Enrollment Management Team (EMT), chaired by the AVP of enrollment management; the Academic Operat ions Team (AOT), chaired by the provost; and the Program and Curriculum Review Committee, which includes faculty and elected student representatives and is currently chaired by the senior institutional research analyst. (2.A.11) The organizational framewo rk was designed to ensure communication and planning efforts toward the development and successful implementation of institutional, programmatic, and departmental goals in NWCCU Year Seven Report 48 2/7/17 Standard Two - Resources and Capacity support of NUNM's teaching and learning environment. The Alignment Model, discussed in Standard One, page 33, and in detail within the Framework for Action 2012 -17, was established to originate all university activities from the purpose, values, and mission of the institution, setting the stage for an operation that comes from a place of integrity. Each administrative position is designed to serve the insti tution's mission and objectives. Similarly, departmental plans of action are aligned with the institution's mission and goals. The framework of the institution provides for the appropriate chain of command and efficient use of personnel, while promoting t he team interaction necessary to facilitate appropriate planning, successful implementation, and assessment and revision as needed of common goals and objectives. Tracking of planning processes includes assessment of achievement of goals and objectives and is coordinated by the senior institutional research analyst within Institutional Research and Compliance utilizing strategic planning software, Strategic Planning Online (SPOL) (2.A.9). (2.A.11) NUNM's structure of teams fosters mission accomplishment th rough collaboration within and across departments. The graphic below provides an overview, which has been updated for the 2017 -2022 Framework for Action. For more detailed discussion, see the Framework for Action , (pages 17 -23). (2.A.11) NWCCU Year Seven Report 49 2/7/17 Standard Two - Resources and Capacity NWCCU Year Seven Report 50 2/7/17 Standard Two - Resources and Capacity POLICIES AND PROCEDURES Academic Academic policies are listed in the student and faculty handbooks (enclosed separately) as well as on the NUNM Intranet and on PolicyStat, a cloud -based repository that provides members of the community access to view current policies and facilitates updates, revisions, and mandatory review of policies. The studen t handbook is reviewed and revised annually to include all new and updated academic policies and procedures. Program deans are responsible for communicating academic policy changes through faculty meetings and internal communications. Human Resources, Mark eting and Communications, and the Office of Student Life are responsible for communicating academic policy changes to staff and students. (2.A.12) Policies regarding use of library and information resources are published in NUNM's PolicyStat software. The library's circulation policy is enforced using our integrated library system. Fines and fees on circulating materials are assessed by the library system; unpaid fees are transferred regularly to the Business Office. Access to the library's electronic hold ings is controlled by IP authentication for on -campus users, and by proxy server authentication for off -campus users. General use rules for the library are enforced as needed by library staff. (2.A.13) The NUNM catalog (pp.17 -18) provides an expanded deta iling of NUNM's policies and procedures regarding transfer credit. Transfer credit is considered on a course -by-course basis by the program dean or the department chair, who utilize catalogs or course descriptions to make a determination as to whether the request satisfies NUNM's requirements. There must be substantial equivalency and the subject matter must be currently relevant. Individual faculty are consulted for clarification as needed. Challenge examinations may be required to determine whether cour sework is comparable. During the process, transfer credits are clearly identified that will be accepted by NUNM. (2.A.14) Student These policies are delineated in the student handbook, which is updated annually and can be found on the NUNM website . New s tudents are provided information during Orientation regarding academic honesty, appeals, grievances, and academic accommodations, and receive an updated copy of the handbook. In addition, students sign a copy of the NUNM Honor Code which is in Section 14 o f the handbook. Grievance and appeals policies are located in Section 15. Disability and accommodations information is in Section 16. Policies within the handbooks are also located within PolicyStat. (2.A.15) NUNM outlines admission criteria in the prin t and website versions of the catalog that include an application for admission , essays, transcripts that include specific course pre -requisites for each program, description of necessary technical standards, and letters of recommendation. The Naturopathic Medicine and Classical Chinese Medicine programs also require in -person interviews. These components are used to determine the probability of student success. (2.A.16). If a student is separated from the university as a result of not meeting academic, non -academic or technical standard requirements, they are instructed in the appeals as well as the re -application processes. Section 7 in the student handbook outlines Technical Standards, Academic and Clinic Progress, and includes the appeal process. For non -academic issues, section 14 discusses the Student Disciplinary Records, Code of Conduct a nd Honor Code. Section 14.15 outlines the Re -application and Re -admission Policy, which covers both academic and non -academic separations. (2.A.16) The student handbook, Section 17: Student Organizations and Activities, outlines all polices in relation t o co-curricular activities, including responsibilities, rights, publications and other media. It also indicates the responsible employee students may contact with questions and concerns. Section 17.4 outlines student publications; 17.5 discusses student ac tivities; 17.9 and 17.10 list professional organizations. (2.A.17) NWCCU Year Seven Report 51 2/7/17 Standard Two - Resources and Capacity Human Resources The employee handbook , volunteer handbook , benefits intranet page , supervisor manual, and other policies and procedure publications are located in the HR section of the NU NM Intranet and available to all employees. The employee handbook contains conditions of employment, rights and responsibilities, criteria and procedures for evaluations, promotion and termination as well as policies and guidelines. Every hired employee, s taff or faculty, is required to attend a new hire orientation wherein a human resources representative presents the information contained in the employee handbook. In addition, the chief medical officer, dean of students, chief of security, and facilities manager present pertinent information during orientation that helps ensure the successful on -boarding of staff and faculty. Topics include safety and security, emergency evacuations, blood borne pathogen and body fluid exposure, comprehensive OSHA training , Incident reporting, Title IX, FERPA and ADA Compliance training. In the absence of a presenter, video presentations can be viewed during orientation to ensure consistent training by subject matter experts. (2.A.18) The employee handbook is edited and re vised every three years. As part of the revision process, legal counsel reviews the content for compliance with applicable federal, state, and local laws, and recommends revisions as needed. Additionally, policies affecting faculty are reviewed every other year for inclusion in faculty contracts. Other policies are reviewed on an ad hoc basis as need arises. Both the faculty handbook and the employee handbook underwent revision in 2014. All HR policies, procedure s and protocols found in the employee and faculty handbooks are also located in PolicyStat. This allows Human Resources (and other departments) to update information as needed, thereby communicating any additions or updates to employees immediately rather than waiting for a handbook revision. (2.A.18) The administration of HR benefits is consistent within employee groups: all full -time faculty are treated equally as are all other categories of employment, e.g. part -time, hourly, adjunct, and exempt, etc. T o ensure that benefits are administered consistently in employee groups, the following practices are implemented: Faculty contracts are reviewed by HR to ensure consistency across all Schools and Colleges. Hours worked for all staff and faculty are monito red on a consistent basis by three HR employees, ensuring that an employee's status is correct based on number of hours worked, or in the case of faculty, work load. Changes made to ensure the above include: addition of hours to all faculty contracts to cl arify workload so benefit eligible faculty receive healthcare insurance as directed under the Affordable Care Act, review of timesheets to ensure hours worked are in alignment with the employee status noted in the HRIS, and FLSA increases made for exempt e mployees in accordance with the new DOL mandate. In addition, a retirement audit is performed annually to ensure that all employees working over 20 hours per week are paid the correct amount of retirement benefit in conjunction with our institutional contr ibution rate of 4 %. NUNM is developing a new Faculty Classification and Compensation model that is projected for launch in fiscal year 2017 -18 that provides for equitable compensation across the curriculum for faculty at different levels in a \"step model\" reflecting credentials, experience and workload assignment. (2.A.18) NUNM is committed to attracting, developing and retaining top talent. HR works closely with hiring managers to identify the competencies required for each position. During the interview process, the internal and/or external applicant is provided with a full copy of the job description. Upon hire or promotion, a signed copy of the job description is placed in the employee's personnel file. Any changes/updates to the job descripti on by the supervisor require the employee to sign and receive a copy of the updated job description. During the annual HR audit, the VP for HR randomly selects 10 employee files to ensure compliance. If any unsigned job descriptions are found, the employee is contacted by HR and a signature is secured within five business days. (2.A.19) NWCCU Year Seven Report 52 2/7/17 Standard Two - Resources and Capacity Interviews are conducted with a minimum of two interviewers using behavioral interview questions. For higher level positions an interview panel is often used to help ensur e the selection of the best candidate available. Notes are taken on all candidates and submitted to HR for documentation as part of the hiring process. All external applicants are subject to a criminal background investigation, reference check, and verific ation of degrees from regional and national accredited institutions. Twice a year the HR director performs a random check of files of five employees hired in the last three years to verify compliance. If it is determined that an employee background check i s missing, they would be asked to submit to a background check (with verification of degrees for faculty members). (2.A.19) After new hire orientation, all employees continue through the onboarding process via a robust NUNM On - Boarding Program that was dev eloped in conjunction with the academic department. The program has a check list with one month, three month, six month and one year markers that target subject areas for completion. The Onboarding Planning Checklist is available on campus. In addition, ea ch department has position specific onboarding checklists and provides specific departmental training. For example: new NUNM faculty work closely with Faculty Support and all clinic providers to receive onboarding sessions with the dean of clinics, directo r of clinic operations, health centers billing, and the Epic site specialist. To ensure that all new hires go through the on -boarding process as scheduled, individual onboarding forms are utilized and signed off at each step of the process. This form is t urned into Human Resources and placed in the employee's file on the employee's first anniversary date. (2.A.19) Current job descriptions and institutional organizational charts are available on the NUNM Intranet. The job descriptions are updated and added as needed, and the organization chart is updated every quarter. Documents will be available on site. (2.A.19) The filing cabinets that house the employee files within the HR office are locked at the end of each business day. The employee handbook contain s a policy on employee confidentiality, page 50. (2.A.20) Institutional Integrity NUNM's Department of Marketing and Communications and individual team members strive for professionalism in every aspect of their work, always remembering the department's responsibilities of producing accurate, timely and appealing results that advance NUNM's standing in professional and public regard. Personal and institutional integrity inform our operational systems, setting priorities and interaction with colleagues and the community. Since the inception of the department in 2007, the charge has been to create unified, consistent, and accurate messages about the university, its programs, and its services. These branded messages reach the NUNM community and the public thr ough a number of avenues, including the university's multiple websites, social media platforms, newsletters, major publications, advertising, and all other means of university communication that originate in this office. In Framework for Action 2012 -2017, KPI 7 (Continuous marketing and communications action planning, page 44) addresses some of these responsibilities and associated desired outcomes. (2.A.21) Department procedures are firmly in place to maintain clear and accurate messaging. It is a systematic process designed to first obtain the correct, most current information, and then to convey that information in a meaningful way to the intended audience. The marketing and commun ications team's process for creating any of our major publications, for example, begins with requesting pertinent information from appropriate sources before drafting copy, which is then submitted to a series of proofing rounds before content is passed on to the designer for layout. By incorporating a series of proofing opportunities at several stages during the process, even the most data -heavy publications, such as the course catalog, are routinely produced without significant error. Website development a nd other departmental communications are guided by similar processes. All projects are organized into a deadline -related production schedule that NWCCU Year Seven Report 53 2/7/17 Standard Two - Resources and Capacity guides daily operations and is the basis for weekly team meeting status reports and discussions. (2.A.21) Publications, websites, and other communication tools also are assessed for effectiveness, appeal, and functionality on an ongoing basis. While print materials are freshened annually, electronic communication, by its very nature, demands more constant monitor ing and updating. Our audience of prospective students, patients, donors, and the general public are accustomed to fast response, user -friendly online communications; we keep that fact in mind every day as we work toward improving this dynamic communicatio ns tool. Our web presence has evolved over the years, and in summer 2015 the website underwent significant changes with the successful move of our website to WordPress. The webmaster then implemented substantial content updates (with stakeholder approval) and improved navigation throughout the site. (2.A.21) When the institution was granted university status in September 2015, the Marketing and Communications department immediately began planning a strategic pathway and comprehensive timeline for a rebrand ing campaign. The timeline focused on graphic design, website, public relations and communications, signage, and other responsibilities specific to Marketing and Communications, but also indicated when other departments' actions (especially IT) intersected with our schedule at various points in the process. Following the Board's approval of the NUNM name at its February 2016 meeting, the Marketing and Communications department began extensive behind -the-scene preparations for a rebranding campaign that woul d be triggered by President Schleich's formal announcement of the new name at the June 2016 commencement ceremony. Rebranding activities were superimposed on the department's routine production schedule, and the graphic team developed new logo concepts for presentation to the president and board. Upon approval of the new logo, the team began work to replace/update signage, letterhead, business cards, recruitment publications, and all other materials that bore the NCNM name and logo. The new name necessitate d intensive technology efforts, and our web team worked with the IT department to register new domain names and related sub -domains, and complete the lengthy and complicated set of changes to all internet and email accounts. Among their many tasks, the web team was also charged with reviewing all web content and updating NCNM references where appropriate. (2.A.21) With the official press release and formal adoption of NUNM as of June 28, 2016, these materials and web changes began to be rolled out through the summer. Most of the major rebranding changes were completed by September 2016. Rebranding efforts also ushered in the debut of the NUNM Style Guide \u2014a reference document for staff, faculty and vendors. This guide provides detailed instruction on the use/treatment of NUNM and affiliate logos, color palette, typography and more. (2.A.21) The Alignment Model, discussed in Standard One, page 33, was created by the board to delineate the interrelationship between NUNM's purpose, vision, mission, values, and planning strategies. The implementation of the concepts of this framework in the direction of activities of the university leads to policies a nd procedures that are fair and ethical in the treatment of all constituencies and provides a structure for the resolution of disagreements by returning focus to the institution's purpose, vision, values (respect, integrity, creativity/innovation, commitme nt, excellence), and mission. The Alignment Model is posted on campus and is provided in the Framework for Action (see pages 24 -25) and in the student handbook (see page 11). (2.A.2 2) Student, faculty and employee handbooks provide the policies and procedures to address complaints or grievances in a fair and timely manner. The responsibilities of NUNM's Title IX coordinator and contact information are clearly listed in the student h andbook, the catalog, the NUNM website, and provided on the NUNM Intranet. (2.A.22) As described in 2.A.4, members of the NUNM Board of Directors sign a conflict of interest policy annually (appendix 2.2). The faculty handbook contains a policy on Professional Ethics and Conflict of Interest NWCCU Year Seven Report 54 2/7/17 Standard Two - Resources and Capacity (pages 54-55). Information and policy regarding various aspects of employee conflict of interest are found in the employee handbook on pages 11 -14. (2.A.23) The facul ty handbook contains two sections (pages 44 -49) that relate to copyright ownership and all forms of intellectual property created at NUNM. Various categories of work are defined, and the resulting implications for shared or outright ownership of intellect ual property that is produced as a particular kind of work are delineated. There is also a section of the handbook that pertains to the use of self -published materials as required texts in the classroom (pages 46 -49), which is a practical extension of the copyright ownership issues. (2.A.24) Section 12.11 of the student handbook discusses the intellectual property and copyright issues pertinent to student behavior. It stipulates that students own the copyright to works they create in the course of their education, including online postings in hybrid -style classes. It also stipulates in what manner students may use recordings and other artifacts that they harvest from their classes and faculty. (2.A.24) Institutional and programmatic accreditation status is listed on the inside cover of the course catalog and on the university website: http://nunm.edu/about/accreditation/ . (2.A.25) NUNM enters into written agreements that clearly define NUNM's respons ibilities with community clinics in which our students, under the oversight of our faculty, provide medical services. The educational experience of students in community clinics meets the same requirements as those of the on -campus clinic. The community c linic sites are chosen to broaden student experience, addressing medical conditions of underserved populations not well represented in the on -campus clinic, such as immune deficiency or addiction recovery. A sample clinic agreement is attached (appendix 2. 6). (2.A.26) Academic Freedom The NWCCU Year Three site visit in April 2014 determined that there was no direct evidence that the board had approved the institution's academic freedom policy. The provost recalled that the policy was developed under the direction of Dr. Jim Miller, president from 1989 -1993. As a result, the board at its next available meeting in June 2014 formally approved its long -standing academic freedom policy: \"NUNM faculty and students are free to question, discover, and test all kn owledge appropriate to their discipline as judged by the academic community in general.\" (appendix 0.4 - Board meeting minutes June 2014). (2.A.27) The academic freedom policy is embedded in the faculty (p. 44) and student (p. 84) handbooks. In addition there are clearly described policies related to faculty responsibilities regarding copyright law, intellectual property issues, selection of textbooks, plagiarism, conflict of interest, and other issues in the faculty handbook on pages 44 -55. (2.A.27) At NUNM, faculty and students are accorded the freedom to teach, learn, and pursue scholarly and research interests without interference or penalty from the administration or commercial sponsors. This freedom is subject to the norms and standards of scholarly inquiry in the U.S. and relevant NUNM policies pertaining to faculty responsibilities and employment. As professional educators, NUNM faculty members are free to teach their material as they choose. They are also expected to stay within the flow of the designed curriculum and be accurate and careful in what they say, exercise appropriate judgment and ethics in managing the classroom, and give proper credit when referencing the ideas of others. When engaged in patient care, faculty are expected to respec t the rights of their patients and exercise discretion regarding the use of patient information in their teaching. (2.A.27) As NUNM representatives, faculty members are free to question and criticize university policies and practices without fear of repri sal. In voicing critical opinions, faculty are expected to strive for accuracy NWCCU Year Seven Report 55 2/7/17 Standard Two - Resources and Capacity and civility. As citizens, NUNM faculty members are free to voice their opinions about matters in their life without fear of censorship or discipline by the university. They a re also expected to keep in mind that what they do and say as private citizens could indirectly affect the university, and therefore they should be careful, accurate, and respectful of others in their public behavior; and make it clear that they are not speaking for NUNM. (2.A.27) Among NUNM's values are creativity and innovation. This commitment to facilitating a culture of intellectual freedom is reflected in one of the objectives for Core Theme Three, Professional Vitality: Preparation of students to engage in scholarly interaction with other professionals and supporting the free exchange of ideas, respectful debate, and other exercises of intellectual curiosity. Further discussion of Core Theme Three can be found in Core Theme Achievement Narrative ( appendix 0.1). (2.A.28) The faculty handbook contains brief sections on plagiaris m and professional ethics (p. 54 ) that address the citation of sources issue and full disclosure regarding potential conflicts. In addition, there is a more extensive secti on in the faculty handbook that pertains to managing financial conflicts of interest in research (pp. 55 -63). In this policy, written to be in compliance with the Department of Health and Human Services revised regulations for promoting objectivity in res earch ( Final Rule 42, CFR Part 50, subpart F ), the highest standards for academic honesty and integrity in research are promoted. (2.A.29) Finance The institution has clearly defined policies, approved by its board, regarding oversight and management of financial resources. These include financial planning, board approval and monitoring of operating and capital budgets, reserves, investments, fundra ising, cash management, debt management, and transfers and borrowings between funds. The policies are available on the Intranet; board specific policies are published in the Framew ork for Action , Part One, Section III, pp. 26 -32. (2.A.30) STANDARD 2.B. HUMAN RESOURCES Human Resource functions are centralized under the vice-president of human resources, who has over 20 years of career human resource experience and over two years with NUNM . The Human Resources Department consists of a payroll and benefits manager, a human resources generalist, and a faculty contract/human resources coordinator. The vice -president of human resources reports directly to the CFO. (2.B.1) The institution endeavors to employ sufficient personnel to meet its curricular and operational objectives. On an annual basis, administrators define what is sufficient for their departments and submit a budget request for both human and financial resources, w hich are reviewed and ultimately approved by the president and the board, provided sufficient resources are available. If sufficient resources are not available, prioritization for expenditure of university funds must be determined. At that time, funds are allocated to departments based upon the institution's core mission. As such, positions and monies that directly affect student services and the education of students in all programs have top priority. (2.B.1) As described under 2.A.19, during the employ ee recruitment process, the HR Office advertises a job description that includes a summary of responsibilities, duties and qualifications. During the interview process, the applicant is provided with a copy of the full job description. Upon hire, a signed copy is placed in the employee's personnel file. Any changes/updates to the job description by the supervisor re2quires the employee to sign and received a copy of the updated job description. (2.B.1) The employee handbook contains conditions of employmen t, rights and responsibilities, criteria and procedures for evaluations, promotion, and termination. Current job descriptions and institutional organizational charts are available on the NUNM Intranet. (2.B.1) NWCCU Year Seven Report 56 2/7/17 Standard Two - Resources and Capacity A common evaluation process is used for NUNM's staff and administrators. Non -faculty employees receive a formal evaluation from their supervisor at the end of 90 days in a new position, and annually thereafter. This process is supported by the HR Department. The evaluation of an employee's work begi ns with a review of the position description of the individual and is based on goals specific to the position, individual goals created by the employee, and performance standards applicable to all employees. (2.B.2) As a result of recent assessment of the employee evaluation system, the process was modified in November 2014 so that the annual evaluation for non -faculty employees occurs in November rather than at the anniversary of the date of hire. Evaluation criteria have been refined, and performance is now aligned with key competencies and metrics. The annual performance review was updated again in 2015 and 2016 to include a simplified four dimensional rating scale: key contributor, strong performer, solid performer and under performer. Competencies tha t have been added for evaluation for all staff include contribution to work teams, self -development, and work standards. Competencies for supervisors and managers now include leadership, managing execution, generating talent, organizational capability, fis cal acumen, organizational sustainability, and cultural competence. It is becoming clear that proficiencies in these core competencies drive individual and organizational success . As supervisors and employees become more familiar with the updated performan ce assessment tool, robust development plans can be assembled with the input of both the manager and the employee. This will ensure employee engagement and increase the likelihood of employee and organizational success. (2.B.2) The supervisor evaluation t ool provides guidance to the supervisor in the performance of the evaluation process. In addition to the performance standards applicable to all employees, the standards include a set of criteria specific to supervisors. Individual specific goals establi shed in the prior evaluation and departmental goals provide a framework for the standards of performance in the evaluation of administrators. Evaluation forms are readily available in the supervisor section of the Intranet. (2.B.2) Developing talent invo lves actively setting performance standards, providing means for development and giving appropriate and timely feedback. As such, the annual performance review is the foundation for career development through goal setting, feedback and developmental planni ng. This competency based performance model focuses on work performance and results. On an individual level, the scores are utilized to develop a professional development plan for the employee and/or manager. On a university wide level, the results of the employee performance reviews are analyzed annually to determine organizational leadership competency strengths and deficiencies, which can be addressed through university -wide training and developmental opportunities. NUNM's Performance Review document is available on campus. (2.B.3) The annual human resources strategic plan utilizes this leadership identification data to assist in developing internal successors, refining the leadership development program year -over-year, and identifying target groups for succession planning and retention efforts. Improvements to the document include a competency based review system that identifies \"contribution to work teams\" and \"self -development\" as core competencies, and there is now a section in the Pre -Interview P rofessional Development Plan that focuses on supervisory behavior that enhances or impedes employee effectiveness. (2.B.3) In terms of institutional priorities, management succession is the third most important issue directly behind financial results and strategic planning as critical factors in institutional success. NUNM's efforts systematically identify and prepare high -potential candidates for present and possible future key positions. In conjunction with the senior management team, HR is actively invo lved in proactive succession planning for all levels of the organization to build a supervisory, management, leadership, and faculty pipeline that is in alignment with the vision of NUNM as a top performing organization in a competitive higher education marketplace. (2.B.3) NWCCU Year Seven Report 57 2/7/17 Standard Two - Resources and Capacity A leadership development program was developed and implemented in the 2015 -16 fiscal year to align the talent to the business needs of NUNM now and in the future. As outlined above, the performance review process is the first step in identifying and developing high -potential employees as future internal leaders for the institution. The second step utilizes success factor analysis where candidates are selected based upon individual potential assessment that identify traits that lead to organizational success. The third step is to close the development gap with individualized career development plans for selected high -potential candidates. These plans include seminars, webinars, advanced degrees, stretch assignments, increased responsibi lities, task force opportunities, special projects or assignments, job rotations, mentorship programs, and teach -to-learn opportunities. These activities are often documented in an employee's annual performance review under Part 2 Goal Setting. During the succession planning phase, once a high performance employee has been identified, a Career Path Document with specific methods for grooming this individual for advancement is put into place. This will ensure that the executive team, the department head, an d the employee are in alignment, focusing on accelerated career growth opportunities for the employee. (2.B.3) University -wide training and developmental opportunities for management include: Performance Planning and Management, Time Management, Coaching, Constructive Feedback and Accountability, Leading Effective Teams, Talent Development, Bureau of Labor and Industry Compliance (BOLI), and several other sessions. Supervisors, managers, directors, department chairs, associate deans, and deans are asked to attend two developmental training sessions per calendar year. Participant feedback surveys are completed and the data consolidated by feedback statements, scores and average scores for seven areas of assessment. Feedback statements include: \"I believe thi s training will benefit my team\" and \"I am confident I will be able to effectively use what I have learned today.\" In addition, the survey includes a feedback section where participants write individual comments that helps the HR team evaluate the effectiv eness and relevance of the training. To date, the mean scores for these trainings \"benefiting the team\" and for \"the managers effectively using information learned\" is over 3.5 on a 4 point agreement scale, with one reflecting strongly disagree and 4 refle cting strongly agree. Individual comments include: \"given tools were useful\", \"tools were tangible\", \"great information\", \"reminder of the importance of our role as leaders and the importance of coaching and developing staff\". (2.B.3) The leadership development series ensures consistency and encourages high performance among the management/leadership team at NUNM. Prior to focusing on, training for, and measuring leadership competencies, the management staff did not have a leadership ben chmark on which to measure individual success. The leadership competencies outlined in the performance review and interview evaluation form measure essential knowledge, skills, and abilities that are critical for a successful manager. These competencies in clude leadership, managing execution, building relationships, generating talent, organizational capability, and financial acumen to name a few. Managers who struggle to build and develop talent have low performers and high turnover. Managers who lack finan cial acumen tend to cause undue financial burden and hardship on the institution, while managers who excel at strategic planning, organizational sustainability and managing execution propel the university forward. This correlation is evident in department al turnover and performance in terms of human capital and financials. These correlations are reflected in the annual performance reviews of individual leadership team members. As such, it is critical that each manager's development plan address low scoring competencies as well as the higher scoring competencies to drive excellence as well as maintain proficiencies that are essential in managing execution of departments. (2.B.3) Ongoing training and development activities for both faculty and staff include four employee seminars on a variety of subject matters identified by the Staff Association, and web -based learning for critical and often mandatory trainings that must reach all members of the community such as Title IX, FERPA, Preventing Sexual Harassment , Active Shooter on Campus, The Clery Act, Campus Security, and Safety for Campus Staff and Faculty. Successful completion of the training programs are measured through on -line reporting NWCCU Year Seven Report 58 2/7/17 Standard Two - Resources and Capacity systems to ensure participation. The on -line training modules are an effective training method that allows NUNM to meet mandatory guidelines by ensuring compliance through monitoring the completion of each class. Ongoing reports and follow -up allows NUNM to reach up to 92% of its workforce (including faculty and staff) for select mandatory training. With the inception of on -line training, we increased our completion percentage from about 40% to over 87%, by all employees, full and part -time, and faculty. (2.B.3) Faculty Sufficiency and Evaluation The university provides op portunities for the professional growth of NUNM's academic and clinical faculty in all stages of their careers through training sessions and activities that enhance faculty teaching styles, including curriculum design, delivery skills and technology profic iency. Core Theme Two, Objective 1, discussed in appendix 0.1, Provide support to faculty in improving their teaching skills, is an example of NUNM's commitment in this area. (2.B.4) The program deans, associate deans, and chairs, with the guidance of the provost, are responsible for ensuring that, consistent with NUNM's mission, Core Themes, programs, services, and characteristics, the university employs appropriately qualified faculty who are sufficient in number to achieve its educational objectives and ensure the integrity and continuity of its academic programs. Policies and procedures specific to faculty are provided in the faculty handbook. Page 32 of the handbook outlines policies for eligibility for faculty appointment and search and appointment procedures. (2.B.4) As NUNM begins the budget preparation process for each coming academic year, the program deans utilize data provided by the Office of the Registrar to construct worksheets reflecting each clinic rotation and course, including all sections, based upon student numbers and the schedule of classes for the coming year. Faculty worksheets take into consideration the rank and step (and resulting pay) for each faculty member. The program deans then work with the provost and CFO to create budgets for each academic department utilizing the worksheets. Courses, sections, or clinic rotations for which a new faculty appointment is needed are posted, and the faculty member is selected in accordance with university policies. Faculty contracts are created by the HR department for each faculty member, utilizing the worksheets provided by the academic administration. Faculty needs identified through this process are addressed at the beginning of the budget preparation process, and if projected fa culty needs change, the faculty budget line is given the highest priority within the academic budget. (2.B.4) The Academic Operations Team (AOT), chaired by the provost, oversees the development, evolution, and approval of academic policies. Potential re visions to academic policies typically come from the originating office, although a request for consideration of a policy change could come from other sources, such as the Faculty Senate or the Student Government Association. All policies of the universit y are housed in PolicyStat. The AOT meets monthly and includes program deans; the CFO; the provost, the VP of accreditation, assessment, and compliance; and the two AVPs. (2.B.4) Faculty responsibilities and workload are overseen and managed by the prov ost and the program deans. Each faculty member is provided with a job description by HR that explains the expectation of the general duties outside of their required teaching load. Pages 29 -31 of the faculty handbook define the five types of faculty statu s at NUNM: full -time, partial load, adjunct, administrative, and emeritus faculty. The handbook also enumerates the expectations and benefits of each classification. Full -time, partial load, and administrative faculty are eligible for employee benefits. T he recently added partial load category addresses faculty requests that NUNM consider providing benefits to faculty who, although not fulltime, dedicate a significant portion of their work week to the institution. (2.B.5) The faculty evaluation process is described on pages 34 -36 of the faculty handbook. Each program dean, with the support of associate deans or chairs, evaluates full -time faculty members annually and at least once every five years for adjunct faculty. These evaluations take into consider ation quarterly course evaluations NWCCU Year Seven Report 59 2/7/17 Standard Two - Resources and Capacity by students, supervisor or supervisor designee observations, and an electronically completed self -evaluation from the faculty member. Areas addressed within the evaluation include teaching effectiveness, research, profess ional contributions, college and public service, and performance in goal areas set in the prior evaluation. Goals set in evaluations address, at a minimum, any areas of weakness identified through the evaluation process. (2.B.6) NUNM has developed a list of faculty outcomes. These outcomes serve as a model for faculty development and performance but have yet to be fully integrated into faculty evaluations. Our long -term goal is to develop a system where faculty evaluations, desired outcomes, training, pro motions, and salary increases are integrated and reinforce one another. The process toward this goal is being led by a task force chaired by the VP of human resources and composed of the program deans and a representative of the Faculty Senate. (2.B.6) Recommendation: Continue to prioritize development of a system in which faculty evaluations, expected faculty competencies, faculty development, promotions, and the faculty compensation system are integrated and reinforce one another. STANDARD 2.C. EDUCA TION RESOURCES Overview (2.C.1 and 2.C.2) Within NUNM's educational offerings are two doctoral programs, five masters programs, two bachelors programs and a number of certificates within degree programs. In all programs, competencies are identified for the program as well as for each course. Each of NUNM's degree and certificate programs is consistent with NUNM's mission: to educate and train physicians, practitioners, and pre -professionals in the art, science, and research of natural medicine. Curricula for all degree and certificate programs are designed and delivered at the level of rigor appropriate to the degree or certificate. Degree titles are consistent with the professions represented. Educationa l outcomes for all degree programs are published within the catalog but are not identified for all certificate programs. Student learning outcomes are published for each individual course in all degree and certificate programs. Course competencies are list ed as part of the standard syllabus format. Students receive and are made aware of course competencies when they receive (and when instructors review) the course syllabus at the start of each class. Syllabi for each degree program are available on campus. Further discussion of programs can be found under Graduate Programs below. The College of Naturopathic Medicine awards the Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine (ND) degree. Students within the ND program may choose to also pursue certificates in Homeopathy and/or Naturopathic Midwifery. In addition to providing course competencies, program outcomes and programmatic competencies within the ND program are also included in the syllabus for each course. Programmatic outcomes are noted in the course catalog. App ropriateness of content is reaffirmed through review and inclusion of competencies agreed upon by the accredited ND schools through the efforts of the Association of Accredited Naturopathic Medical Colleges (AANMC) and mapping of the content of national bo ard exams to the course level. The College of Classical Chinese Medicine awards two degrees, Master of Science in Oriental Medicine (MSOM) and Doctor of Science in Oriental Medicine (DSOM), and certificates in Shiatsu and Teaching Qigong. The College of CCM is teaching out a Master of Acupuncture (MAc) program. The certificate in Advanced Studies in Classical Chinese Medicine no longer is awarded, as the coursework has been incorporated into the DSOM program. Program level outcomes, published in the cour se catalog, are accompanied by programmatic content area competencies that are reviewed and refined by the faculty to ensure fulfillment of the university and College of CCM mission statements, as well as the requirements of the programmatic accrediting bo dy, the Accreditation Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (ACAOM). They serve as the template for the individual course learning outcomes that are included in the NWCCU Year Seven Report 60 2/7/17 Standard Two - Resources and Capacity syllabi. Each syllabus notes which of the content level competency areas are cov ered by the course. The School of Research and Graduate Studies offers these degrees: Master of Science in Integrative Medicine Research (MSIMR), Master of Science in Nutrition (MScN), Master of Science in Global Health (MScGH), and Master of Science in I ntegrative Mental Health (MSiMH). A Master of Science in Sports Medicine has been approved by NWCCU and will begin as a concurrent -degree clinical program in fall 2017. There are currently no certificate programs within the School of Research and Graduate Studies. The MS programs are entry -level master's programs with competencies related to research, communication, professionalism and foundational knowledge. A comprehensive review of program outcomes was completed in the summer of 2016. As a result, an overarching set of common themes (available on campus) was developed for programs in the School of Research and Graduate Studies. The School of Undergraduate Studies admitted its first classes in fall 2016 in a Bachelor of Science in Integrative Health Sciences (BSi HS) and a Bachelor of Science in Nutrition (BScN). Further discussion can be found in the Overview/Preface section under Addenda. Awarding of Credit, Depth & Breadth, Admissions, and Graduation Requirements The registrar maintains permanent records of e ach student. NUNM awards credits based upon hours of instruction per quarter. Fall, winter, and spring quarters are defined as 12 weeks; summer quarter is defined as 11 weeks. One credit is defined as 12 lecture contact hours plus 24 hours of work outsid e of class per quarter; or 24 laboratory contact hours per quarter + 12 hours of work outside of class per quarter or 24 clinical contact hours per quarter + 12 hours of work outside of class per quarter. Course requirements, including grading criteria, a re provided by each faculty member on individual course syllabi. (2.C.3) In spring 2013, utilizing the student quarterly course evaluation process, NUNM captured data from students in the ND and MSOM programs regarding the amount of time worked outside of the classroom for each course. Data resulting from this process, combined with faculty input concerning amount and approximate completion time of outside work required per course syllabi, was used in the recent curricula reform processes for the ND and MS OM degrees and development of the DSOM. As the new courses within the Schools of Undergraduate and Graduate Studies are developed, this template for awarding credit is utilized and reflected in course syllabi. (2.C.3) Requirements for admission, pages 13-20, and graduation, page 157, are clearly defined in the catalog and are easily accessible to students through the NUNM website. The catalog is also available in hard copy. (2.C.4) NUNM's curricula review processes, including for potential new progra ms, ensure resonance with the institutional mission and accreditation standards, and incorporate the coherence of program layout and appropriateness of depth and breadth of coursework. A request for consideration of a new program or project, or reframing of an existing program, may be made by any member of the community utilizing a recently implemented process: New Initiatives for This Year (NIFTY). Projects that are academic begin with the Academic Operations Team for initial development and, once ready for approval, move through the Program and Curriculum Review Committee, composed of student and faculty representatives, and are eventually reviewed by the board, and our accrediting bodies. Further refinements to this process are being drafted for potent ial implementation in the coming academic year and will continue to include a participatory process that ensures the cohesiveness and quality of the program and its support of the mission and values of the institution. (2.C.4) Responsibilities of Faculty The authority and responsibilities of NUNM faculty are well defined through documents such as faculty NWCCU Year Seven Report 61 2/7/17 Standard Two - Resources and Capacity contracts (full -time and adjunct contract templates , appendix 2.7 ) and the faculty handbook. Faculty, individually and collectively, are responsible fo r assessing student achievement of clinical and course specific academic learning outcomes, which are mapped to programmatic learning outcomes. In addition, NUNM's communications and committee structure empowers faculty to play a major role in the design, approval, implementation, and revision of curriculum. (2.C.5) The Faculty Senate (FS) serves as a representation and advocacy group for faculty issues as well as a governing body. The Faculty Senate Bylaws (available on site) delineate faculty governance. The Senate is open to all full - and part -time NUNM faculty. A FS member serves as an elected constituency non -voting representative on the board, and to its Academic Affairs Committee. The FS meets monthly to share information and to discuss matters related to curricula, program planning, faculty workload and assignm ent, professional development, and research activity. The FS appoints representatives to sit on board committees, university councils, and teams. A subcommittee of the Faculty Senate, the Faculty Development Committee (FDC), oversees allocation of a fund for continuing education of individual faculty members, recommendations for faculty promotion, and recommendations for faculty sabbaticals. The FDC also provides guidance to faculty in the development of their portfolios, a component of the promotion proc ess. As discussed earlier, NUNM's curriculum committee, the PCRC, includes faculty from all schools and colleges of the university. (2.C.5) In addition to monthly meetings of the FS, faculty meet as a whole annually, and by department twice monthly, wi th one meeting dedicated to academic issues and one to clinical ones. Faculty meetings are chaired by the program deans. Monthly academic and clinical faculty meetings facilitate regular communication among faculty members and between faculty and administr ators. Some individual departments also utilize faculty subcommittees to review their courses and curriculum, organized around subject areas. Subcommittees typically meet when specific areas of the curriculum are being re -evaluated. (2.C.5) The College o f Naturopathic Medicine is in the middle of a revised curriculum launch and a teach -out of the foundational curriculum. The new ND program outcomes were created by a committee of faculty and administrators which were then reviewed and approved by the Facul ty Senate. Within this process were consideration of competencies developed by the AANMC and input invited from all ND faculty through a dedicated e -mail address, surveys, focus groups, and faculty meetings. CCM faculty worked through subcommittees and as a committee of the whole through faculty meetings and retreats to develop the DSOM entry level first professional doctoral program that was launched in fall 2015 and to differentiate the coursework and competencies specific to the MSOM degree. Similarly, chairs and faculty within the School of Research and Graduate Studies worked with the dean of the School in the development of each of its degree programs. Development of the curricula of the two programs within the School of Undergraduate Studies was su pported by faculty from other degree programs as well as newly hired undergraduate faculty. (2.C.5) Faculty serve on an ad hoc hiring committee, headed by the Human Resources Office, that interviews potential faculty members and makes recommendations to t he program dean and provost. Final selection of faculty positions is made by the provost following recommendation by the dean and the ad hoc hiring committee. Faculty also serve on the hiring committees for administrative positions that are of special interest to faculty. A recent example is the search for a founding dean of the School of Undergraduate Studies. (2.C.5) A focused effort has been made to embed research literacy outcomes and competencies in the curricula at NUNM. Faculty who teach courses that have been traditional venues for librarian instruction about how to use the library have collaborated with librarians to reword and strengthen outcome statements and assessment requirements in specific course syllabi. In particular, the outcomes for the Clinical Correlates NWCCU Year Seven Report 62 2/7/17 Standard Two - Resources and Capacity class in the ND program and the Evidence Informed Practice class in the Chinese medicine programs were revised and enhanced in order to emphasize library and information literacy. The following is an example of a library research sp ecific outcome that is embedded in the Clinical Correlates syllabus: at the end of this course, the student will be able to demonstrate appropriate use of the library resources available for researching patient symptoms and complaints. The Vanguard Faculty continue to work with the library to embed EIP research literacy outcomes across all curricula. (2.C.6) Librarians have collaborated with the Helfgott Research Institute in the discussion of library resources, particularly the use of the Medline database , in their research classes and curricula. Vanguard faculty, under the leadership of a librarian, created a list of six outcomes for evidence -informed practice research and information literacy skills (available on campus). These outcomes were approved by the Program and Curriculum Review Committee for eventual inclusion in all curricula at NUNM. (2.C.6) NUNM does not award credit for Prior Experiential Learning. Development of policies and procedures may eventually be considered for the undergraduate de gree programs. (2.C.7). Transfer credit is considered on a course -by-course basis by the applicable program dean and program chairs, who utilize catalogs or course descriptions to make a determination as to whether the request satisfies NUNM's requirem ents. There must be substantial equivalency and the subject matter must be currently relevant. Individual faculty are consulted for clarification as needed. Challenge examinations may be required to determine whether coursework is comparable. During the process, transfer credits that will be accepted by NUNM are clearly identified. (2.C.8) The catalog (pages 17-18) provides NUNM's policies and procedures regarding transfer credit as well as policies specific to individual degree programs. The final judg ment on determination of transfer credit is solely the responsibility of NUNM. NUNM policies are designed to ensure comparability with the nature, content, academic quality, and credit hours of the transferred course with the corresponding NUNM offering. The applicant must be in good academic and behavioral standing at the originating institution. (2.C.8) Undergraduate Programs Please refer to Addenda in the Preface for information on our newly implemented undergraduate degree programs. (2.C.9 and 2.C.10) No undergraduate a pplied degree and certificate programs are offered. (2.C.11) Graduate Programs NUNM's degree programs are consistent with the institution's mission, meet the standards of specialty accrediting bodies, (as reflected by programmatic self -studies and accreditation evaluations), and reflect the demands of the professions they represent. (2.C.12) The university is a member of the Association of Accredited Naturopathic Medical Colleges (AANMC) and their Council of Chief Aca demic and Clinic Officers (CCACO), which is comprised of deans and associate and assistant deans from all of the schools accredited by the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME), the U.S. DOE recognized specialty accrediting body for naturopathic medicine. This body has made significant progress in establishing agreed upon knowledge - and practice -based competency requirements for all ND program graduates. The work of CCACO has influenced the development of competency statements at NUNM. (2.C.12) Similarly, NUNM is a member of the Council of Colleges of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (CCAOM) and participates on several of their working committees: First Professional Doctorate, Student NWCCU Year Seven Report 63 2/7/17 Standard Two - Resources and Capacity Services, Faculty Development, Curriculum Development, and Accreditation. CCAOM is an association of schools accredited by the Accreditation Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (ACAOM), the U.S. DOE recognized specialty accrediting body for acupuncture and oriental medicine (AOM). (2.C.12) Evidenc e of knowledge and scholarship and high level professional practice is documented through a number of tools. Clinic entrance and exit exams are utilized in the ND, MSOM, and DSOM programs. The DSOM program includes scholarly work in Classical Texts and c oursework that supports the student toward completion of a capstone project of research and writing in Chinese medicine. CCM programs include coursework in Chinese History and Culture and electives in Chinese Cultural Arts. Case report training is currentl y being introduced as a longitudinal thread through the CCM curricula. By the 2017 -18 academic year, graduating students will have completed a publication -quality case report on one of their clinic patients. ND students are required to complete a Case Port folio in their final year of study. (2.C.12) Each program within the School of Research and Graduate Studies includes activities that demonstrate students' fundamental knowledge and skills and prepares them for professional success. Students in the MSiMR program develop research skills through a series of coursework in the design and execution of research in integrative medicine and demonstrate their research skills and expertise through the completion of a research study in an area of their interest. Thr ough the development of menu plans, recipes, and patient information handouts, students in the MScN program demonstrate their skills in medical nutrition therapy. In the MSiMH program, students engage in individual recorded sessions where they practice cou nseling skills and receive feedback from peers and instructors. Students in the MScGH program complete a cultural immersion experience where they develop their ability to work within different cultural settings. This prepares them for a fieldwork experienc e where they implement the skills they have learned in the didactic portion of their education. (2.C.12) NUNM outlines admission criteria in the print and website versions of the catalog (pp. 13 -20) that include an application for admission, essays, trans cripts that incorporate specific course pre -requisites for each program, description of necessary technical standards, and letters of recommendation. The Doctorate of Naturopathic Medicine and Classical Chinese Medicine programs also require in -person inte rviews. These components are used to determine the probability of student success. (2.C.13) Transfer credit is considered on a course -by-course basis by the applicable program dean and program chairs, who utilize catalogs or course descriptions to make a determination as to whether the request satisfies NUNM's requirements. There must be substantial equivalency and the subject matter must be currently relevant. Individual faculty are consulted for clarification as needed. Challenge examinations may be required to determine whether coursework is comparable. During the process, transfer credits that will be accepted by NUNM are clearly identified. The catalog (pp.17 -18) provides an expanded detailing of NUNM's policies and procedures regarding transfer cr edit. NUNM does not grant transfer credit for experiential learning. (2.C.13) NUNM structures and monitors all learning experiences and assesses achievement of learning outcomes. The ND program requires 10 clinic credits (240 hours) of ND Field Observati on in which students broaden and strengthen their clinical skills under the mentorship of licensed physicians in practice. In addition to refining skills developed within the NUNM teaching and community clinics, the student may utilize this opportunity to pursue clinical areas of special interest. (2.C.14) The Colleges of Naturopathic and Classical Chinese Medicine also have a Community Education requirement (one lab credit, 24 hours for ND and DSOM; one -half lab credit, 12 hours for MSOM). These learning opportunities require pre -approval (from the associate dean for ND and from the faculty member who oversees business courses for CCM) and include activities such as giving lectures and presentations to NWCCU Year Seven Report 64 2/7/17 Standard Two - Resources and Capacity outside community organizations reflecting the medica l knowledge base of the student's future profession. (2.C.14) The School of Research and Graduate Studies includes internships and fieldwork experiences within the nutrition and global health programs. The nutrition program includes an internship experie nce where students work with a community partner for a minimum of 48 hours. Within the internship, students synthesize the information they have acquired within their coursework and apply it to practical experiences with local organizations or in clinical settings. The internship is currently being revised and expanded to 96 hours that can be completed with one or more organizations. (2.C.14) Students in the global health program design a project with individualized learning outcomes that are matched to both the student's interests and goals, linked to the overall program outcomes, and meet the needs of the fieldwork site. Fieldwork projects (2 00 hours) can include community organizing, marketing, or media advocacy campaigns, educational workshops, curriculum development, qualitative or quantitative research, independent comparative analyses, program evaluations or program planning development s uch as needs assessments, evaluations, interventions, or program mapping. (2.C.14) The ND, MSOM, and DSOM programs prepare students for professional medical practice. ND students are prepared as primary care providers. The academic and clinical education within each of these programs provides training to meet or exceed professional expectations as reflected by their specialty accrediting bodies and the professions, as evidenced by a recent seven year reaccreditation in both professions by the CNME (2014) and by ACAOM (2016). (2.C.15) (appendix 2.8 - program approval letters from CNME and ACAOM) The Doctorate of Naturopathic Medicine degree program prepares graduates to practice as primary care physicians through a combination of didactic and clinical ed ucation. Naturopathic doctors conduct a thorough, holistic medical history and physical; recommend, administer and interpret diagnostic tests and procedures leading to a diagnosis that is consistent with conventional medical practice, as well as the princi ples and practice of naturopathic medicine. Naturopathic medicine is inherently patient centered, and doctors formulate and use individualized treatment plans using both naturopathic and conventional therapeutic modalities. Treatment options are informed b y naturopathic philosophy, principles and clinical theory and focus on wellness and illness prevention. Treatments are applied in a safe, legal, ethical, and efficacious manner with an emphasis on adhering to the principles of naturopathic medicine. These include approaches to first do no harm, recognizing the healing power of nature, and healing the whole person. Naturopathic doctors are trained to function within the limits of their expertise, scope of practice and respect of patient's needs, wishes, and abilities. Additional information is available under \"Acronyms\", ND. (2.C.15) The Master of Science in Oriental Medicine and Doctor of Science in Oriental Medicine programs are taught by core faculty trained in the classical traditions of Chinese medic ine. Their coursework provides a solid framework of understanding of the many approaches within the larger field of Chinese medicine. It also includes a full -year, three course training (Traditional Mentorship Tutorial I -III) in the theory and application of a particular clinical approach of their choosing. This, combined with a \"fixed intern rotation\" (working with the same chosen clinical supervisor throughout their internship year), ensures that each student gets in -depth, mentor -style training in their preferred classical approach to clinical practice. Training in the development of professional case reports using the CaRe Guidelines is being introduced throughout the MSOM and DSOM programs. This will support the ability of graduates to communicate clinical outcomes within and beyond their profession. All CCM students receive foundational training in biomedicine, and get inter -professional training by participating in Primary Health Care teams with Naturopathic (and other healthcare) providers in the NUNM clinics. (2.C.15) NWCCU Year Seven Report 65 2/7/17 Standard Two - Resources and Capacity The DSOM program is designed for a higher level of achievement of the CCM mission, with increased emphasis on training in \"the ancient tradition of the medical scholar\". In a series of nine courses, students learn to directly access (through the original language) clinically relevant information in the classical texts of Chinese medicine. They are supported to apply this knowledge in clinical practice on their clinical rotations. A course series entitled \"Imaginal and Experiential Inq uiries\", taught every quarter of the program, supports the development of critical thinking, clinical reasoning, and reflective capacity in the DSOM students. This series of courses supports students to select, refine, research, write and present a doctora l capstone project on a topic that demonstrates their attainment of classical Chinese medical scholarship. (2.C.15) NUNM's recently established School of Research and Graduate Studies houses non -clinical degree programs. Health and natural medicine themes are central to all programs within the School of Graduate Studies. There are currently five master's programs in the School of Graduate Studies, and four under development. These programs are designed to deliver education that can either complement a clin ical degree, or lead to non -clinical career paths. Didactic and hands -on curricula in the graduate programs provide students with strong foundational knowledge and skills. Students are then encouraged to build on these skills through practical experience i n internships, fieldwork, or through the conduct of original research. Practical experience requires students to be creative and equips them with critical thinking skills, while preparing them for future independence. Faculty who oversee students in the Sc hool of Graduate Studies are trained both in pedagogy and in mentoring. Thus, they are prepared to assist students at every phase of their development, as they develop original research ideas, contribute scholarly works to their respective fields, or seek new career paths. (2 .C.15) Continuing Educ ation and Non-Credit Programs Continuing education and our community education institutes are housed under the Office of Advancement, Continuing Education and Alumni Affairs. NUNM's continuing medical education activities are specifically planned to enhance the post -graduate education of naturopathic physicians, Chinese medicine practitioners and natural medicine researchers, in alignment with our mission \"to educate and train physicians, practitioners and pre -professionals in the art, science and research of natural medicine.\" Continu ing education courses are developed by the CE department with known subject matter experts, some of whom deliver the presentation or workshop. Courses are also reviewed for content by outside professional licensing boards. Registration fees pay for present er speaking and travel fees and other overhead such as staffing and marketing. All conferences and most other courses are offered via live webinar to expand the reach beyond the local region, and recordings are accessible via an online library. Non-credi t programs that are not continuing medical education are offered under our Age Wise, Food as Medicine, Traditional Roots, and Women in Balance Institutes and offer community education, not -for- credit, classes that provide samples of our medicines for the g eneral public. Examples are cooking and nutrition courses and herbal and natural medicine lectures, which serve to educate the public and promote awareness of natural medicine practice. These offerings to the general public also serve our students and physicians as a resource for their patients who need additional help learning about ways to live a healthy lifestyle. (2.C.16) Continuing education courses or conferences are not offered for academic credit. The institution, through the Continuing Education Department, maintains direct and sole responsibility for the quality of all aspects of its continuing education programs and courses. The CE Director, who holds a Master of Education in Learning Design and Technology from the University of Southern Califor nia, develops the conferences and presentations with the aid of subject matter experts, including the program deans, the faculty, and professionals from the community. Learning objectives are developed as part of the outline for each course or presentatio n. All deans from the ND and CCM programs are included in the Continuing Education Review Committee (CERC), which meets regularly to provide input on conference topics and speaker NWCCU Year Seven Report 66 2/7/17 Standard Two - Resources and Capacity selections for upcoming events. (2.C.17) All CE activities are reviewed and approved by the Oregon Board of Naturopathic Medicine (OBNM). Some activities in 2016 have also been reviewed and approved by the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (NCCAOM) and the American Academy of Family Practitio ners (AAFP). (2.C.17) Over 140 hours of continuing education in a total of 11 conferences were offered by NUNM's CE programs in 2016, providing continuing education to 1,491 medical practitioners and students. The following table gives an overview of the offerings in 2016 which were delivered live on campus. All CE presentations were pre-approved by OBNM for CE credit. All of these courses were made available via live online webinar, as well as recorded and posted to NUNM's online course catalog for on -demand access. NUNM has used the Adobe Connect webinar platform since early 2012 for providing quality webinar courses with live tech support and moderation for interaction between the CE presenters and webinar attendees. The attendee counts of the events bel ow include those who opted to participate online via live webinar. Typically, between 30% and 50% of the attendees opt to participate online.

Feedback surveys are distributed electronical ly and data is automatically recorded and compiled by the survey software platform. Course objectives are determined by the presenters, with input by the continuing education director. Evaluations of the course by the participants, and by the continuing ed ucation director, confirm that outcomes are met. We periodically survey alumni and other customers for their input on future activities; a customer interest survey conducted in August 2016 was sent to 9,374 email addresses and received 792 responses. These survey responses were used, in conjunction with input from the CERC, past conference evaluation forms, and past conference attendance data, to create a schedule of conference topics for the 2017 calendar year. (2.C.17) The table below provides a listin g: NWCCU Year Seven Report 67 2/7/17 Standard Two - Resources and Capacity CONFERENCE TOPICS 2017 January 28 -29, 2017 Autoimmune Disorders February 11 -12 Food as Medicine March 25 -26 Women in Balance April 8 -9 Chinese Medicine May 19 -21 Traditional Roots June 3 -4 SIBO Symposium July 29 -30 Medical Cannabis August 19-20 Primary Care September 23 -24 Integrative Genetics October 21 -22 Gastroenterology November 18 -19 Mental Health The generally accepted norm is to apply for CEU approval through the Oregon Board of Naturopathic Medicine for naturopathic courses and through the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (NCCAOM) for Chinese medicine practitioners. CEUs for the naturopathic profession undergo an application and approval process with the state licensing board, the Oregon Bo ard of Naturopathic Medicine (OBNM), a third -party, non -profit organization. In this process, appointed OBNM board members, primarily other physicians, evaluate the course content and approve it for CEUs based on appropriate scope and rigor, as well as the credentials of the presenter. Naturopathic physicians in Oregon need 50 CEUs annually to renew their licenses, to include 10 hours in the topic of pharmacy and two hours in the topic of medical ethics. The OBNM also distinguishes courses eligible to count toward the pharmacy and ethics requirement. Oregon's standards for naturopathic CEUs are typically stricter than other state associations, such that those approved in Oregon are accepted in other states. The exception to this is California, which has its own application and approval process. Some courses offered at NUNM will have undergone this process and are thus eligible to count toward ND license renewal in California. (2.C.18) CEUs granted for the Chinese medicine profession undergo a similar process with the NCCAOM, a national non-profit organization that validates entry -level competency in the practice of acupuncture and Oriental medicine (AOM) through professional certification, and advocates continuing education standards within the AOM community. Applications for CEUs, called Professional Development Activities (PDAs), are submitted and evaluated for content and rigor. Courses are further categorized into core activities or elective categories. Acupuncturists must accumulate 60 PDAs every four yea rs to renew their certification, of which 26 must be categorized as related to core competencies, two must be categorized as related to safety, and two must be categorized as related to professional ethics; the remaining may be in core areas or other desig nated areas of study. In order to provide more continuing education opportunities for alumni of NUNM's Chinese medicine program, the continuing education department is making plans to host a Chinese medicine conference on April 8 -9, 2017. (2.C.18) Continu ing education units are awarded based on attendance, which meets the standards of both the OBNM and the NCCAOM. As discussed earlier, survey responses after each event are examined in order to determine whether each conference, presentation, or event was c linically relevant for practitioners. (2.C.18) NUNM maintains records describing the number of CE courses, content and attendees (available on site). These are organized into reports prepared for NUNM board, which meets three times each fiscal year. NUNM also reports these figures to its programmatic accreditors annually. (2.C.19) NWCCU Year Seven Report 68 2/7/17 Standard Two - Resources and Capacity STANDARD 2.D. STUDENT SUPPORT RESOURCES The Department of Student Affairs is under the direction of the associate vice president of student affairs/dean of students and houses student life, counseling services, intercultural engagement and support services, academic progress and advising, regist rar, and financial aid. These services as well as admissions and student transactions are located in the Administration Building. (2.D.1) NUNM provides extensive support systems for our students. Some of these support systems include free, no-limit counse ling, disability and academic accommodation services, tutoring, a testing center, and college advising. The chart under section 6.3 in the student handbook, page 48, illustrates available support services and responsible persons. Many of the services and p olicies provided by Student Life are detailed on the NUNM student services website link , as well as in the student handbook .(2.D.1) The Office of Student Life also oversees issues regarding the student code of conduct, mediates disputes regarding accommodations between students, faculty, staff, and deans, and provides avenues through which students may registe r concerns, complaints, or grievances. (2.D.1) There is a designated classroom used for \"energy medicine\" where qigong and taiji courses are taught. During open times, students and student -led groups are allowed to use the room for activities such as medi tation, qigong, yoga, Pilates, Reiki, and taiji . The energy medicine room provides a space for students to relax, do exercise, and rest during their many hours on campus. Facilities accommodations that support families through remote rooms, lactation spac e, and family -friendly study areas are discussed later in this document. (2.D.1) Interrelationship between Core Themes and Student Support As discussed in Standard One - Mission and Core Themes, support of student success was chosen as Core Theme One for our NWCCU Seven Year accreditation planning cycle. The first Objective for this theme is: Foster systems that support student success. An Indicator of success chosen for this theme is student satisfaction, with targeted support services for which we ha ve identified specified thresholds. Nine areas important in supporting student success were selected as Indicators for this Objective: academic support, tutoring, faculty advising, faculty support, counseling services, student life office, disability servi ces, library, and IT services. The goal is that no individual area will have a mean response of lower than 7.5 and that the overall mean will be 8.0 or higher. We have begun capturing data in this area and are not yet meeting our student satisfaction goals . The table below provides the mean response for services in each area on a 10 point scale with 1 representing very dissatisfied and 10 very satisfied. The overall mean for all NUNM students for the nine areas in 2016 was 7.38 with individual means ranging from 6.28 to 8.36. Core Theme Achievement ( appendix 0.1), provides additional information. (2.D.1) OVERVIEW OF MEAN STUDENT SATISFACTION DATA FOR TARGETED SUPPORT SERVICES 2016 Mean 2015 Mean 2014 Mean 2013 Mean 2011 Mean Academic support 7.10 6.50 7.78 7.96 6.72 Tutoring 7.43 7.14 8.02 8.02 * Faculty advising 6.38 5.74 6.30 5.51 * Faculty support services 8.36 8.53 8.98 8.78 8.64 Counseling services 7.15 7.59 7.75 7.79 7.00 Student Life Office 7.34 7.40 8.04 7.94 7.93 Disability Services 6.28 7.24 7.43 7.30 * Library 8.19 8.34 8.67 8.54 8.22 IT services 8.17 8.53 8.82 8.55 8.27 Annual Mean 7.38 7.45 7.98 7.82 7.79 *included in academic support NWCCU Year Seven Report 69 2/7/17 Standard Two - Resources and Capacity Counseling Services The NUNM Counseling Center, created in 2010, provides free individual, couple and group counseling to NUNM students. Students are often referred for consultation on stress management and other mental health challenges by faculty or staff, and as part of the adjudication process of the Honor Council and Academic Review and Appeals C ommittee. Students also contact the Center directly. Students are typically seen within two weeks of requesting an appointment. The waiting list for services occasionally exceeds two weeks. The director has expanded the Counseling Center to include service s provided by master's level college interns from other accredited schools and NUNM student peer counselors. Since its inception, the Center has grown from one professional counselor to include 1.75 professional counselors, and up to 12 interns and five NU NM peer counselors per year. Over 600 students have been seen. An average caseload for graduate interns is 10 to 12 students. An average caseload for NUNM peer counselors is three students. (2.D.1) As the need for counseling continues to grow, the Counseling Center has reached full capacity in terms of physical space. There are currently five treatment rooms shared between 10 trainees and two staff. These rooms also serve as office space for counselors to complete paperwork and other related tasks. Space and staffing limit the number of available appointments, resulting in a wait list. At present, if students are unable to schedule an appointment with the Center, they are referred to the larger mental health community. With the increase of individ uals on the Oregon Health Plan (OHP), there is typically a six week wait for intake appointments at the major agencies accepting OHP, and there is an additional three to five week wait to see an assigned counselor. Unless individuals are diagnosed with a s evere and persistent mental illness, they will be offered a limited number of counseling sessions. An alternative for students is to pay for private sessions out of pocket, fees for which can range from $60 and $200 per hour. In June 2016, an assistant director of counseling services (.75 FTE) was appointed to expand staffing of the counseling center. (2.D.1) Recommendation: Continue to review data on counseling services use and wait list for the Counseling Center and, based upon that review and as budget permits, consider funding for increased staffing, space, and hours of operation and/or other methods to ad dress student needs. Career and Business Development The NUNM Center for Career Development (CCD) reports to the Enrollment Management Division, a team that encourages cross departmental collaboration throughout the university to provide information a nd resources that optimize the student experience leading to successful outcomes. The CCD assists students and graduates with preparation for success in experiential education, private practices, industry and other areas of interest, such as preparation of CVs/resumes, networking, public speaking, self -advocacy and other professional development activities. In addition the career services manager works with the business instructors to offer guest visits and strive for continuity across programs. CCD hosts w orkshops and small facilitated group meetings. In addition the center offers one -on-one professional guidance and support to meet students' unique career development needs. Students and alumni are encouraged to stay current with NUNM's Career classified we bsite for the continued posting of positions available and sites for rent or sale. Students are consistently implored to actively engage in career development activities throughout the student lifecycle . (2.D.1) CCD seeks to increase the knowledge and awareness of NUNM students and graduates, especially in professional areas where students and graduates could seek gainful employment. CCD hosts recruiters offering paid positions and helps to coordinate interactive business opportunities for students or g raduates. Examples are career fairs provided annually and The Integrative Practitioner/ The Optimal Professional (TIP TOP) Fair. CCD also plays a role in keeping NUNM involved and the community up -to-date on the efforts of professional associations, includ ing legislative efforts, best practices, and industry standards. CCD works to actively engage the business community and stakeholders in university life. (2.D.1) NWCCU Year Seven Report 70 2/7/17 Standard Two - Resources and Capacity The CCD is focusing career awareness efforts on job titles of recent graduates, skills sets an d market trends. Many of the programs offered are part of emerging professions where new job titles are being created and becoming recognized. There are new industries where there are standards that fit the likely careers of our graduates. This can be evi denced by the recent addition of a unique occupational code for acupuncturist by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. As part of the health care industry where there is not only a growing need but an increasing demand for patient centered care, new opportu nities and job titles are occurring. Career paths will be an area of focus for bachelor level students as they consider their career goals. In addition, career paths are an area of emphasis when advising master level students or any student considering t he addition of a degree/program. (2.D.1) NUNM has since 2014 maintained a data base that provides a snapshot of employment one year post graduation for each graduating class. For the class of 2014, 89% of graduates reported one year post - graduation tha t they are working in the industry of their degree, and 92% indicated they are working in their industry or successfully engaged in meaningful endeavors of choice. For the class of 2015, 88% are working in the industry and 90% are engaging in meaningful e ndeavors of their choice. Information is tracked from business websites, self -reporting, LinkedIn, licensure and National Provider Indicator numbers (where applicable). Also captured from graduates are job title, employer, salary, and skills sets used. F ourteen percent of all eligible graduates provided additional wage details on employment outcomes. While creating meaningful wage data is always challenging, due to both the variable nature of employment and the irregularities of self -reported data, it is particularly challenging for natural health care professionals, who tend to be self -employed. For this reason, only hourly wages are being reported in the one year post - graduation snapshot. This will be the primary focus of improving wage data for advance d degrees where self-employment is more common than employment. The average wages for naturopathic doctorate alumni were $47 per hour with 9% reporting. The master of nutrition program had an average hourly wage of $41 per hour with 30% reporting. These a re the only programs that had enough wage data to provide meaningful information. It is also notable that the majority of naturopathic doctorate alumni reporting were employees, while almost half of the master of nutrition alumni were self -employed. In fa ll 2016 the institution purchased the Career Module within Symplicity, affording an improved manner in which to track this data. (2.D.1) In addition, NUNM surveys all alumni every three years. Data captured includes annual income, adequacy of preparation for their field, and whether or not the graduate is currently employed in a field directly related to the NUNM degree. Two indicators for Core Theme Three (Professional Vitality) utilize data from these alumni success surveys. See Core Theme Achievement N arrative (appendix 0.1 ) for additional discussion. Income and employment results of the 2014 alumni survey are in the alumni section of the NUNM website. (2.D.1) Safety and Security The Office of Campus Safety promotes a safe and secure environment to a ll constituents of its campus by means of a community -friendly approach that enhances security through the visibility of safety officers, preventive patrols, positive conflict resolution, and crime and awareness programs. The Safety Office provides emergen cy response and patrol services during all open hours. There is also a 24 -hour on -call alarm and incident response. Emergency procedures and evacuation plans are posted across campus, and security and safety alerts are posted online and near student mailbo xes and in off -campus clinics. NUNM uses an automated emergency notification system that autodials and emails students, staff and faculty if there is a school closure or an immediate risk on campus. (2.D.2) The director of security reviews incident report s, prepares crime statistics, and manages the details of on site security including the contracted security monitoring company. NUNM provides an annual campus security report, published online in compliance with The Cleary Act, with statements and crime st atistics for the university, including additions made by The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). A paper copy NWCCU Year Seven Report 71 2/7/17 Standard Two - Resources and Capacity can be requested from the Director of Security. Information regarding crime statistics, in compliance with the Clery Act, is noted in the student h andbook, page 138, and is listed on the government website (http://ope.ed.gov/security ) where statistics for the last three years can be viewed. The annual statistics and security report are also available on the NUNM website http://NUNM.edu/security -reports/ . (2.D.2) NUNM complies with reg ulations established by local, state and federal agencies, including Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA), Multnomah County Health Department, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Portland Fire Bureau, Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industry, Ame ricans with Disabilities Act, Oregon Administrative Rules, City of Portland, HIPAA, FERPA, and insurance risk management. (2.D.2) Students and staff attend required annual training on topics that include emergency procedures, incident reporting, hazard co mmunication, use of personal protective equipment, handling of tuberculosis exposure, and infection control. As health care workers, students are trained in CPR, participate in TB surveillance, and are offered the hepatitis B vaccine. As of July 1, 2015 al l incoming students whose course of study will include clinical rotations or field -work experience are required to undergo a drug screen prior to matriculation at NUNM. Students enrolled prior to July 1, 2015 are required to undergo a drug screen prior to any clinical rotations or field -work experience. (2.D.2) Ensuring safe practices in both the clinical and academic settings, for example, the Bloodborne Pathogen Policy, the activities of the Safety Committee, and our policy addressing substance waste disposal, are discussed later in this standard under 2.G.2, page 91 . The campus emergency preparedness plan includes a Crisis Response Team (CRT) that convenes and runs drills on an ad hoc basis to address topics of concern, such as swine or avian flu epidemics or an active shooter on campus. The clinic has an emer gency evacuation plan that was developed by a private contractor to address the specific needs of the clinical population. The chief medical officer together with the Safety Committee reviews and revises policies as necessary. A few of the current and upco ming emergency objectives include: installing new locks on classrooms in the academic building to allow for a more effective lockdown program; an active shooter table -top drill held in spring 2016; and development of a \"Return to Normal Operations\" emerge ncy plan. (2.D.2) Title IX The responsibilities and contact information of NUNM's Title IX coordinator are clearly listed in the student handbook, the catalog, the NUNM website, and provided on the NUNM Intranet. The website provides Title IX information under \"About NUNM\" and under \"Organization of NUNM\" . The process is clearly outlined in section 13 of the student handbook. In addition, the Title IX Coordinator is in the process of updating all interpersonal violence brochures and pamphlets to comply with the new Oregon Senate Bill 759. (2.D.2) NUNM has a selected and specifically trained staff to serve as impartial investigators when a report requires a more comprehensive investigation. The investigators are charged with meeting with the involved parties (including any witnesses) to gather information, testimony and evidence; assessing the information and evidence gathered for merit and credibility; rendering a decision regarding any policy violation; and determining, in conjunction with the director of student life and conduct, if any sanctions are to b e applied. The NUNM Title IX team has an on -going monthly table -top exercise meeting, and attends a minimum of one annual investigator training. In 2016, NUNM contracted with the Association of Title IX Administrators (ATIXA) \"Title IX Tune Up\" for on -camp us training. The training included meeting with the President's Cabinet on Title IX issues and full -day training for the Title IX team. Topics covered were legislative and case overview, prevention review, investigation brush -up and first response, and bes t practices for Title IX and LGBTQiA rights. (2.D.2) NWCCU Year Seven Report 72 2/7/17 Standard Two - Resources and Capacity Human Resources has contracted with BLR, an online webinar provider, to offer trainings for all employees. In addition to the online modules, the Title IX Coordinator presents either in person, or by video, at the monthly new employee orientation. The Title IX Coordinator covers topics such as reporting options and protocol, responsible employee mandates, and resources for those filing reports for all forms of interpersonal violence. The Title IX Coordina tor, with the Director of Campus Security and the Director of Student Access and Success, present on campus safety, Title IX and interpersonal violence and consent, and bystander intervention for incoming students during each of the new student orientation s and for employees during the campus safety in -service annual employee training (included with OSHA). (2.D.2) The recently revised faculty syllabus template for all degree programs includes Title IX and equal opportunity status requirements. Below is th e statement provided within course syllabi. NUNM Commitment to a Healthy Learning Environment NUNM is committed to providing a healthy learning and work environment free of all forms of discrimination. Specifically, NUNM prohibits discrimination on the ba sis of age, sex, race, national or ethnic origin, sexual orientation, marital status, gender identity and family relationship, religion or disability, or veteran's status in any of its policies, procedures or practices. NUNM prohibits sexual harassment, in cluding sexual assault, sexual harassment, domestic and dating violence and gender -based stalking and works to support anyone experiencing these types of misconduct. All NUNM employees are required reporters of sexual misconduct unless, at the time of your report, you are being seen in a counseling session or at a patient visit at our clinic. Please contact Cheryl Miller, AVP Student Affairs & Dean of Students and Title IX Coordinator, 503 -552-1510 or cmiller@nunm.edu with questions or concerns. Additional local, regional, and national resources can be found on the NUNM Sexual Assault and Interpersonal Violence website: http://studentservices. nunm.edu/sexual -assault -prevention/ For more information about services available to students, please visit the NUNM Student Services Center: http://studentservices.NUNM.edu/ (2.D.2) Enrollment Management The admission process is overseen by the Office of Admissions in collaboration with other university stakeholders. NUNM has implemented a strategy of comprehensive enrollment management to better recruit, enroll, and support student s. The newly -created position of associate vice president of enrollment management oversees the Office of Admissions, Center for Career Development, and the Office of Marketing and Communications. The enrollment management focus provides a continuum of stu dent support, from first inquiry to alumni status. The implementation of this concept will coordinate efforts to better recruit, matriculate, support, retain, and employ students and alumni. (2.D.3) The university also hosts an Enrollment Management Team (EMT), which focuses on systems coordination and managing issues related to recruitment, enrollment, retention, customer service, data management, marketing, and assessment of effectiveness. The Office of Admissions is a key member of the EMT; this team is chaired by the associate vice president of enrollment management and includes representation from Academics, Student Life, Registration, Institutional Research, and Financial Aid, as well as Admissions. The minutes of EMT meetings are available on site. ( 2.D.3) The Office of Admissions includes nine positions: director, associate director; four recruiting admission counselors; one operations manager; one coordinator of communications, events, and visits; and one recruitment and admissions coordinator. Th e department has four foci: recruitment, on campus visitation and events, communications, and operations. (2.D.3) NWCCU Year Seven Report 73 2/7/17 Standard Two - Resources and Capacity The application, admission criteria, technical standards, educational offerings, curriculum, requirements for graduation, and transfer polici es are provided on the NUNM website and in the catalog, pages 13 -20. The admission staff, members of the faculty, and the corresponding program dean comprise the Admission Committee that participates in the application review process. If English is a secon d language, the applicant must submit official scores from the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL). NUNM requires a score of 550 on the written exam, or 213 on the computer exam and 79 on the Internet -based test. All non - US accredited transcript s must be submitted for translation and evaluation to one of three approved services listed in the catalog (page 15). The Offices of Admission, Student Life, and Registration collaborate to work with international students to create a support system for th eir transition into the United States and NUNM, and to prepare them for academic success. These typically revolve around issues of finance, personal concerns (lack of local support systems and cultural differences), and I -20 and visa renewal (and border cr ossings). (2.D.3) NUNM practices a holistic application review process, assessing multiple facets of a student's preparedness for academic success. The Colleges and Schools at NUNM have differentiated application processes, each developed to relate to the Core Theme of Student Success as best determined by that College or School. One of the chosen Objectives and accompanying Indicators is directly tied to the admission process: Ensure standards for admission result in matriculation of students who are acad emically and non -academically prepared for the rigors of medical school, graduate school, and undergraduate degrees . (2.D.3) NUNM seeks to matriculate highly qualified students who will achieve academic and non -academic success by ensuring they meet the r igors of their program of study. For the Colleges of Naturopathic Medicine and Classical Chinese Medicine, students are assessed for preparation in the sciences and non -cognitive skills, as both are critical to the success of those entering the medical pr ofession. The set of standards for admission has been modified to incorporate the addition of graduate degrees in the School of Research and Graduate Studies, as well as undergraduate degrees. For the School of Research and Graduate studies, course prerequ isites are identified to lay a foundation for academic success. For the School of Undergraduate Studies, past academic success is seen as an appropriate indicator of preparedness. (2.D.3) Indicator a - Accepted applicants meet or exceed six targeted non-cognitive admissions criteria The Colleges of Naturopathic Medicine and Classical Chinese Medicine evaluate both academic preparedness and non -cognitive skill sets. To assess the aforementioned skill sets, the Office of Admissions utilizes six non -cogn itive indicators for applicants to these programs. This assessment is part of the interview process and includes the evaluation of oral communication, professionalism, attributes of a physician, medical school preparation, demonstrated self -responsibility, and maturity. NUNM set two goals in relation to these non -cognitive assessments. (2.D.3) 1. All accepted applicants will score a minimum of 3 on a 1 -5 assessment scale for each of the non -cognitive indicators Of the incoming classes from fall 2014 to fal l 2016, 95.6% of accepted applicants scored a 3 or higher on each of the 6 non -cognitive assessment skills. Of the remaining 4.4%, more than half (56%) of these accepted applicants had science GPAs above our institutional goal. We have, therefore, approach ed but not yet met our goal for this part of the indicator. Because this indicator is only one part of the holistic application review, these non -cognitive skills do not solely inform admission decisions. We will continue to monitor this indicator to asse ss if the standard should be modified. (2.D.3) ACCEPTED APPLICANTS S CORING 3 OR HIGHER IN EVERY N ON-COGNITIVE CRITERION 2014 2015 2016 93.9% 97.5% 94.7% NWCCU Year Seven Report 74 2/7/17 Standard Two - Resources and Capacity 2. More than 50% of accepted applicants will score greater than 80% on the overall assessment We have met and exceeded the goal for the second part of indicator a. Of the incoming classes from fall 2014 to fall 2016, 85.4% of accepted applicants scored an 80% or higher on the non -cognitive assessment. The average score for these incoming classes i s 88.1%. (2.D.3) In our initial set of assessments, the admissions interview included 7 non -cognitive indicators; 1 of the 7, English skills, was eliminated as it proved not applicable to the majority of our applicants. The current indicators, summed, are worth 30 points. The adjusted goal (80% of the total) is 24. (2.D.3) ACCEPTED APPLICANTS S CORING 80% OR HIGHER ON THE NON -COGNITIVE ASSESSMENT 2014 2015 2016 81.0% 80.7% 85.0% Indicator b - Accepted applicants meet or exceed targeted GPA standards for admission The second indicator of preparedness is previous academic success. NUNM's holistic application review includes consideration of four different GPAs: cumulative, prerequisite, science, and extended science. Each of the four is seen as an indi cator of past academic success. Of these, science GPA is seen as the best predictor of academic readiness as it relates to the core curricula of the Colleges of Naturopathic and Classical Chinese Medicine. ND and CCM require prerequisite courses in biolog y, physics, and chemistry. (2.D.3) NUNM determined an average science GPA of 3.3 to be an appropriate indicator of academic success; this goal was established based on historical trends. We have met our goal for this indicator. Of the incoming classes f rom fall 2014 to fall 2016, the mean science GPA is 3.37. (2.D.3) AVERAGE SCIENCE GPA OF ACCEPTED NATUROPATHIC AND CLASSICAL CHINESE MEDICINE APPLICANTS 2014 2015 2016 3.39 3.34 3.37 The degree programs in the School of Research and Graduate Studies require prerequisite courses in math, biology, and psychology, as well as a bachelor's degree. Two of the three programs also require chemistry as a prerequisite course. Success in these c ourses is seen as an indicator of a foundation for coursework. The School of Research and Graduate Studies degree programs do not require admission interviews, but rather place emphasis on experience, rationale for interest in the program, and the intentio n for the degree, among others. (2.D.3) Based on historical trends, NUNM has determined an average cumulative GPA of 3.3 to be an appropriate indicator of success in graduate school. We have met our goal for this indicator. Of the incoming classes from f all 2014 to fall 2016, the mean cumulative GPA is 3.36. (2.D.3) AVERAGE GPA OF ACCEPTED SCHOOL OF RESEARCH AND GRADUATE STUDIES APPLICANTS 2014 2015 2016 3.32 3.39 3.36 The two undergraduate degrees offered for the first time in fall 2016, a Bachelor of Science in Integrative Health Sciences and a Bachelor of Science in Nutrition, are designed to prepare graduates for careers in integrative health. We have determined a cu mulative GPA of 3.0 or higher to be an estimated appropriate indicator for success. NUNM transfers in credits of courses with a GPA of 2.0 or higher, while evaluating courses in the general education curriculum to ascertain future academic success. We wi ll continue NWCCU Year Seven Report 75 2/7/17 Standard Two - Resources and Capacity collecting information and looking at student performance to determine the appropriate standards for this population. (2.D.3) NUNM conducts ongoing assessments of the application review and interview processes to determine if they effectively evaluate candidates. Annually, the incoming class is surveyed to gain insight into how we can better the admission process. Additionally, we annually evaluate the admissions metrics to assess the quality of the applicant pool, comparing it with our goals a nd looking at overall trends. This data is available for review on site. (2.D.3) Examples of the utilization of the review process to inform changes are the modifications to the candidate evaluation process. NUNM revised the ND and CCM interview questions and created an evaluation tool that assesses the applicant for six targeted non -cognitive admissions criteria identified as necessary to a practitioner (including interpersonal communication skills, empathy, and professionalism). The new applicant assessm ent tools were created by a working group of faculty and admission officers. NUNM also revised the technical standards for all degree programs. The revised standards, which are provided in the catalog, pp.18 -19, were drafted with participation from all pr ogram deans and members of the Offices of Admissions, Registration, Institutional Research, Financial Aid, and Student Life. The resulting policy changes were vetted through the Enrollment Management Team (EMT) and approved through the university's formal policy approval processes. Another recent change was the shift from individual interviews throughout the year to focused NUNM Interview Days. These have improved faculty participation in the interview process and provide the beginnings of a support networ k for students prior to matriculation. (2.D.3) The Office of Admissions works with the Academic Department and registrar to award transfer credit and advance standing status. There is a collaborative effort to meet with and help students understand their credits earned and remaining curriculum. The AY 2016 -17 college catalog (pp. 17 -18) provides an expanded detailing of NUNM's policies and procedures regarding transfer credit that may be awarded for graduate level work from a professional degree program or a graduate program closely related to the health sciences, and completed at a USDOE recognized and regionally accredited institution. Credits accepted for transfer must be determined by NUNM to be substantially equivalent to the courses in content and hou rs. The university does not give credit for life experience, and the applicant must be in good academic and behavioral standing. (2.D.3) Recruitment The Office of Admissions annually creates, and seeks EMT approval for, a Strategic Recruitment Plan. This plan is a comprehensive document, identifying the recruitment goals for the upcoming academic year and proposing strategies for recruiting a competitive class. This document serves as the principal guide for implementing an effective recruitment strategy ; it is tailored to NUNM's programmatic goals and is focused on continuing the university's legacy of excellence by recruiting from around the globe the best and brightest students who are dedicated to the fields of natural medicine, classical Chinese medi cine, mental health, nutrition, global health, and integrative medicine research. (2.D.3) The 2016 -17 Strategic Recruitment Plan focuses on solidifying data management and tracking in order to make sure recruitment resources are used as efficiently as pos sible. Emphasis is placed on being strategic in investments and integrating both innovation and proven techniques. A copy of the plan is available on campus. (2.D.3) The recruitment strategy is divided into three segments, each corresponding with a phase of the admissions lifecycle: prospect, applicant, and admitted student. This strategy prioritizes high touch points, as experience highlights the strong correlation be tween personal touch points and matriculated students. Each phase of the recruitment process has tailored outreach initiatives, each designed to strategically and NWCCU Year Seven Report 76 2/7/17 Standard Two - Resources and Capacity effectively use resources. With the recruitment initiatives outlined in this plan, NUNM rema ins committed to a personalized and attentive approach to every student who expresses interest in the university's academic offerings. NUNM's recruitment plan has, at its core, the student experience. We make every effort to remove administrative barriers while demonstrating complete integrity in assisting the student in determining the best fit in achieving academic and professional goals. (2.D.3) The Enrollment Management Team participates in the review of this plan and the ongoing assessment of recruitm ent policies and procedures throughout the academic year, although the responsibility primarily rests with the Office of Admissions. Each year, the admission staff reviews the recruitment and admission processes and policies to ensure they are effectively and clearly communicated. (2.D.3) Acceptance rates have been traditionally high. Prerequisites for admission are strenuous, resulting in prescreening of students. Only those who can meet the prerequisites are allowed to proceed forward in the admissions process and make it to the stage of a completed application. (2.D.3) ADMISSIONS HEADCOUNTS 2010 -2017 Dissolution of Assets and Teach -Out Policies NUNM Bylaws, Article II Dissolution of Assets outlines arrangements should they be necessary. \"Upon any dissolution and final liquidation of th e Corporation, all assets shall be distributed to an organization described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Code or to a governmental entity for public purposes; provided, however, such organization or entity shall provide the same or similar services or have the same or similar purposes as this Corporation.\" (2.D.4) NUNM Policy BA.2.22, Teach -Out Policy: In the event of program elimination or significant change in requirements, NUNM will make appropriate arrangements to ensure that enrolled students may complete their program in a timely manner and with a minimum of disruption. Any teach out agreements into which NUNM enters will be submitted for prior approval with the Northwest Commission o n Colleges and Universities (NWCCU), and the institution with whom the university makes the agreement will meet the accreditation standards of the NWCCU and any applicable specialty accrediting bodies.

The university clinics (NUNM Clinic on campus and our neigh borhood based community clinics) use the OCHIN Epic electronic medical record system for patient charting, scheduling and billing. Access to OCHIN Epic is through a secured internet portal, and no permanent medical records are stored in either paper or ele ctronic forms on campus. Clinical charts are signed by the student and the supervisor. OCHIN maintains HIPAA secure off -site storage of all patient records. NUNM staff, faculty and students are issued secure login identification appropriate to each indivi dual's status. Patient information can only be viewed through these secure portals. In addition, all staff, faculty, and students who have access to patient protected health information are trained in HIPAA security and privacy rules when first on -boarded and then annually. Archived records of older paper records have been scanned into computer readable storage and are available through secure access by medical records staff only. Individual compliance with the HIPAA security and privacy rules are monitored on a regular basis. Daily walk -through of the clinic locations reveal if any protected health information has been improperly handled. We do periodic audits of patient charts to check if there has been inappropriate access. If there is a concern or patter n that emerges, disciplinary action and/or additional training are immediately implemented, with adjustments to workflows and procedures when indicated. (2.D.7) Student Records The Registrar's Office oversees all functions concerning student records and reports to the AVP of student life/dean of students. Staffing includes the registrar, associate registrar, and assistant registrar. They administer both the clinic and academic registration processes. Records are maintained using SONIS, the student informa tion system implemented in 2006. Access to SONIS is defined by user ID and password, thereby protecting students' privacy while allowing access to staff and faculty as needed to perform their jobs. Students' clinical hours and patient contacts are tracked using FileMaker Pro database. Records are maintained according to our records retention policy outlined in the student handbook, section 3.10, p. 29. The Registrar's Office is also responsible for the enrollment, certification of credit hours, tuition and fees, and updates for students eligible for benefits under the GI Bill and Yellow Ribbon programs. (2.D.7) NWCCU Year Seven Report 78 2/7/17 Standard Two - Resources and Capacity Faculty are responsible for entering grades into SONIS. The registrar is responsible for making grades official, at which time students may view the ir grades online. Discrepancies reported by either students or faculty are researched by the registrar and corrected as needed. Changes are documented via a grade change form that becomes a permanent part of the student's academic file. Students are given a status report each quarter, reflecting the number of clinic hours and patient contacts recorded. Degree audits are available in SONIS, allowing students to view their progress towards degree completion. These degree audits are updated as the curriculum c hanges and are used by the registrar as a tool to determine degree completion. (2.D.7) Student satisfaction with registration processes is an area on which the university has focused for the last five years. A primary source of input toward understanding student concerns is the annual student satisfaction survey. Most university services showed a small decline in satisfaction over the past two years, on a scale of 1 -5. Satisfaction with the registration process is significantly lower than the previous ye ar, signaling the need for further examination of changes over the past year. With the multiple tracks available to students, scheduling of classes manually has become increasingly difficult, and may be partly responsible for the dissatisfaction. The tabl e below provides an overview of data for the last four years from the student satisfaction survey. (2.D.7) AGREEMENT WITH STATEM ENT: I AM SATISFIED WITH TH E REGISTRATION PROCE SS 2016 Percentage Agreement by Response Option Mean Response by Year Strongly Disagree 1 2 3 4 Strongly Agree 5 2016 Mean 2015 Mean 2014 Mean 2013 Mean 21.4% 18.5% 28.6% 24.2% 7.3% 2.77 3.40 2.90 2.77 Due to the complexity of our course scheduling needs, the school, to date, has been unable to locate a scheduling software that could substitute for the current manual process and will continue to search for an alternative. The Registrar's Office conducted surveys in recent years, the most recent in April 2015, to solicit student input regarding difficulties with registration. Res ponses indicated that students desired online registration with the freedom to choose class sections that best meet their needs. In winter 2016 we began online registration using a tiered system. As we implement the redesigned ND curriculum and more degr ee offerings, we will continue to monitor student satisfaction with the newly modified registration process. (2.D.7) Recommendation: Continue to search for course scheduling software that could substitute for our manual process. Recommendation: Contin ue to monitor student satisfaction with the registration process through the annual student satisfaction survey and, if needed, follow -up surveys and focus groups. NUNM follows FERPA regulations with regard to access of student information. Students are n otified annually via email of their FERPA rights. Students may view their academic file by presenting a written request to the Registrar's Office per policy as stated in the student handbook, section 3.9, p. 28. Biographical data on students is maintained in SONIS and is accessible via reports. Each student has an educational record that reflects the start, end, or graduation date for each program to which they have applied and/or been admitted. (2.D.7) The Office of Institutional Research and Compliance ( IRC) is in charge of ensuring completion of quarterly IPEDS surveys. The IRC also maintains databases containing admission data, NCCAOM exam results, cohort default rates, attrition, and student demographic information. Much of that information is availab le NWCCU Year Seven Report 79 2/7/17 Standard Two - Resources and Capacity publicly via the Factbook on the NUNM website: http://nunm.edu/about/quick -facts -figures/ Because students may pursue multiple programs, change tracks, or drop or add programs after matriculati on, calculation of attrition data cannot be accomplished with currently implemented SONIS modules. Therefore, tracking this data is a time -consuming and partially manual process. (2.D.7) Recommendation: Pursue implementation of a new function available i n SONIS that will allow for more automated tracking of attrition. It is anticipated that this function will allow more reliable tracking by cohort for students who change programs, complete two programs, or add a program after their initial matriculation d ate. Implementation of this new function requires back filling of data so that reports can be generated. Secure Records Storage The registrar works collaboratively with the Department of Information Technology to ensure that student records are protected and appropriately maintained. Records are stored in fireproof file cabinets in the Registrar's Office. When a student graduates, the file is scanned onto an external hard drive and then purged. The scanned images are copied to the server in the registrar's file share. The external hard drive, along with daily backup tapes, are kept in a water/fireproof safe on campus. Transcript re cords that outdate the current database system have been imaged and are stored on a hard drive in a safe -deposit box off campus as well as on the main server. Data and records maintained in computing systems have adequate security and provision for recover y in the event of disaster. All files saved on our servers are backed up nightly. Full backups are run every Monday night with differential backups running Tuesday to Friday nights. To ensure data survival, backup of all NUNM data onto backup media is done and stored both off - site and in waterproof/fireproof storage on site. Backup logs of all servers are reviewed daily for any possible errors, and test recoveries from backups are performed monthly. Errors in backup as a result of bad media due to wear and tear are securely destroyed, either by incineration or shredding by our document and data destruction service vendor. (2.D.7) Financial Aid It is the purpose of the Financial Aid Office (FAO) to educate students on the optimal financial aid resources available; to increase understanding of the actual costs of attending the university and its affordability; and to build awareness among students about saving for university costs and personal budgeting procedures. It annually conducts trainings related to bu dgeting, loan repayment, and consolidation. Throughout the year, financial aid staff provide students with an overview of key aspects of the Federal Direct Student Loan Program and options for participating and succeeding in the employment opportunities av ailable to them through the Federal Workstudy Program. (2.D.8) The FAO is dedicated to supporting both our students and alumni. This office holds one -on-one counseling sessions concerning consumer credit counseling, credit report assistance, and seeking a lternative options to meet emergency needs. It participates in a skip -trace program whereby lenders and servicers report students who are delinquent; letters are then sent to corresponding students in an effort to assist them in getting back on track with their payment plan and avoiding default. The FAO also works closely with HR to bring awareness and provide trainings to faculty and staff about opportunities for participation in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program. (2.D.9) The FAO operates on a \" help us, help you\" attitude, and because informed students make informed decisions, we believe our default prevention plan has proven successful in assisting its students. Documentation received from the U.S. Department of Education outlining each school' s Cohort Default Rate supports this (appendix 2.9 ). Our most recent 3 -year cohort default rate for 2013 is 0.7%. (2.D.9) NWCCU Year Seven Report 80 2/7/17 Standard Two - Resources and Capacity Annual student satisfaction surveys provide input into students' level of satisfaction with the Financial Aid Office on a 1 -10 scale with 1 reflecting very unsatisfied and 10 very satisfied. Mean responses are provided in the table below. SATISFACTION WITH OFFICE OF FINANCIAL AID 2016 2015 2014 All students 8.22 8.24 8.25 Occasionally the annual student satisfaction survey has one -time questions focusing on a specific area. In 2014, specific services of Financial Aid were identified. Questions were on a 5 point agreement scale with 1 representing strongly disagree and 5 st rongly agree, with 3 as the mid -point: AGREEMENT WITH STATEM ENTS ABOUT FINANCIAL AID N 2014 Mean My financial aid application was reviewed fairly. 238 4.18 My financial aid application was handled efficiently. 238 4.26 I am satisfied with the knowledge and expertise of the financial aid office. 238 4.16 The service in the financial aid office is courteous. 239 4.08 Academic Advising For several years, the Academic Support Office was staffed by an associate dean of academic progress who reported to the provost and whose responsibilities were advising students experiencing academic difficulties, oversight of tutoring services, and facul ty advising. During the 2015 summer term, this division was relocated to the Office of Student Life and given oversight of the newly -formed Testing Center which was implemented to create a dedicated space for students who require extra time and/or reduced distraction for taking exams. The Center also serves students who need to make up exams due to excused absences for classes missed. An academic advisor was hired to support these expanded services. With the retirement in January 2016 of the associate dean of academic progress, the division of Student Affairs was again restructured. A director of academic success and access position was created and filled, after a job search, by the employee who previously served as director of student life. This new positi on assumed responsibility for academic advising, the Testing Center, and faculty advising. In addition, disability services was added to the area of responsibility, and the Center for Academic Success was created. Having a separate yet embedded Center for Academic Success within the Division of Student Affairs allows for a more cohesive process for students who are seeking academic advising and support, as well as students who require academic accommodations. This busy office has an average of 250 student a ppointments each academic quarter to provide academic advising. (2.D.10) The Center for Academic Success has identified groups of faculty, staff, and students to develop an academic early alert and to discuss general feedback from students on needs to be successful. In addition, the Center has met with the associate deans/progra m deans of each academic program to discuss learning strategies to better serve student learning outcomes and has created a guide for students that is easily accessible from the NUNM Moodle page. These were completed by the end of the 2015 -16 academic year . (2.D.10) In order to improve faculty advising support and student satisfaction, specific attention is being given to the use of the academic advising system and the faculty advising/mentoring program, including the dedication of a departmental goal for the next annual strategic planning year. The Center for Academic Success surveyed all faculty advisors the beginning of the 2016 -17 academic year. (Survey results are available on campus.) The data collected from this survey, from future focus groups with students, and comments from the institutional student satisfaction survey, will help the Center for Academic Success NWCCU Year Seven Report 81 2/7/17 Standard Two - Resources and Capacity hone in on the immediate needs for restructuring of the existing advising program. These include, but are not limited to, rebranding as a m entor program instead of an advisor program, developing a resource packet explaining the responsibilities of different departments on campus, and maintaining ongoing collaboration with the Office of Student Life to have face time with incoming students to further explain and differentiate between academic advisors and faculty advisors/mentors. (2.D.10) Recommendation: Continue to monitor student satisfaction with and make improvements as needed to academic advising processes and with the new faculty mentor process that replaces faculty advising. The student satisfaction survey captures student satisfac tion with support services including counseling, academic support, faculty advising, tutoring, the Office of Student Life, and disability services. Students were asked about the quality and use of resources available in their programs and through the Stude nt Life center. Students showed high awareness of tutoring services at 97%, and for the newer testing center at 84%. About a third of students have utilized each service. Only 15% of students have used the Virtual Bookstore, and it is therefore being disco ntinued.

Some of the student clubs and organizations that demonstrate consistency and support of the mission and values of NUNM include, but are not limited to, the Women's Health Interest Group, Midwifery Club, Herb Society, Student AWARE (Actively Working to Advance Real Equity), Student Doctors for Ethnic Diversity, Yoga Collective, Pediatric Acupuncture Club, Homeopathy Club, NUNM Naturopathic Pediatric Club, Pao Zhi Club, Chinese Herbal Formulae Club, Student Alliance of Integrative Medicine, and Global Health Club. (2.D.11) As stated in the NUNM Student Body Constitution, the mission of the Student Government Association (SGA) is \"to serve as a forum that represents the common needs of the student b ody. The SGA acts as a NWCCU Year Seven Report 82 2/7/17 Standard Two - Resources and Capacity liaison for the student body and the board, administration, faculty and staff. The SGA is committed to enhancing all aspects of student life through programs that enrich students spiritually, culturally, socially and intellectually.\" Section 17 of the student handbook outlines student activities and organizations, including the Student Government Association (SGA). The SGA is funded by a $30 student activity fee assessed to each student each term. SGA provides financial support for v arious clubs and organizations as well as small group projects and events. The Scholarship Committee was created to provide funding for leadership and training opportunities. The Office of Student Life also provides support and funding for student initiati ves and community related events. (2.D.11) Students elect a student body president, vice -president, treasurer, secretary, judicial representative, and Board of Directors liaison to serve as the SGA Executive Council. Each cohort in all academic programs elects class representatives to facilitate communication and plan activities. The 2016 -17 listing of SGA representatives provides an indication of the scope of elected student representation (available on site). The SGA officers (president, vice president, secretary, treasurer, board representatives, and judiciary liaison) constitute the executive team and meet monthly to manage the association. The executive team, class representatives, student liaisons to university committees, and other student represent atives hold a monthly SGA team meeting to share opinions and make reports. The student activities and events coordinator serves as the administrative advisor to the SGA. The coordinator also acts as a liaison between NUNM's administration (deans, VPs, and president) and attends SGA meetings to facilitate communication and seek student opinion. The SGA president and vice president meet monthly with administration, including the president, provost, AVP of student affairs, and program deans. Each year, two non -voting student representatives are elected to the NUNM board. These students meet throughout the year with SGA executive members and class representatives. Additionally, student representatives serve on the College Council, the Information Technology Team , Student Services Team, and Clinic Development Team. Student representatives are voting members on the Program and Curriculum Review Committee (curriculum committee). It is the university's practice to appoint students to administrative search committees. (2.D.11) The Office of Student Life is a resource for any student group or organization interested in holding a student event on campus. It handles room reservations, speaker contract signing, questions regarding catering and food service, etc. The SGA helps students organize various activities including athletic teams (i.e., softball, basketball and soccer), an annual \"No -Talent Show,\" a Chinese New Year celebration, and speaker series. (2.D.11) Ancillary Services The Ancillary Services Department at the National University of Natural Medicine is comprised of the Clinic Laboratory, SIBO Laboratory, Medicinary, Community Clinics Medicinary, NUNM Press, NUNM Store, and Food Service. (2.D.12) The department delivers services, products and support to enr ich the daily lives of faculty, staff, students and patients. Learning opportunities are available for students in the SIBO Laboratory, Medicinaries, and NUNM Store through work study. Depending on the position, students are given exposure to basic busine ss practices including customer service and interaction with patients, technical aspects of SIBO testing, herb identification, compounding, filling prescriptions, evaluating products, merchandising, etc. (2.D.12) Among the many opportunities for communica tion with and to the department are newsletters, surveys, committees, events and presentations. Students, staff and faculty are asked to sit on Medicinary committees, and satisfaction surveys are issued frequently in order to improve services. (2.D.12) (2.D.13) not applicable. NUNM offers no intercollegiate programs . NWCCU Year Seven Report 83 2/7/17 Standard Two - Resources and Capacity Distance Education No NUNM students are currently enrolled in distance education programs. The Master of Science in Nutrition and the Master of Science in Global Health degree programs of fer sections of some 'in -person' courses in an 'online' format so that students can complete asynchronous learning. To date students have completed a statement of authentication that their work is their own. In January 2017 a policy revision process was i nitiated that will lead to second party verification for courses that are completed in an asynchronous format. (2.D.14) Recommendation: Beginning in academic year 2017 -18, for courses that are completed in asynchronous format, second party verification is required in addition to a statement of authentication. STANDARD 2.E. LIBRAR Y AND INFORMATION RESOURCES The NUNM library provides adequate resources to support the mission, Core Themes, and programs of the university. The library collection currently includes over 21,000 books and nearly 2,300 media holdings, an increase of over 30% since the Year Three report in 2014. The library makes every effort, budget allowing, to acquire all required and at least 80% of recommended textbooks for course s. Since 2014, we have met this goal. Survey data in 2015 (available on campus) indicates that increased access to full -text electronic resources is a high priority for students and faculty alike. In the last two years, four new databases have been added, bringing subscribed electronic journal holdings to approximately 12,500 titles. The library also added a Chinese herb library, a permanent collection of 165 single herbs providing students with a new and unique opportunity to interact with common Chinese medicinals. (2.E.1) Library survey data in 2016 (available on campus) indicates that the collection is supporting the mission and programs of the university: 96% of student respondents and 93% of faculty respondents to the survey rated the print book coll ection above average (very satisfied or somewhat satisfied on a 4 -point rating scale). Similarly, 91% of student respondents and 94% of faculty respondents rated the electronic journal collection as above average. Agreement is high among both students and faculty with the statement, \"The library's collections support the learning goals of my program(s)\". (2.E.1) AGREEMENT WITH LIBRAR Y COLLECTIONS STATEM ENTS ON A FOUR -POINT SCALE ; 1=STRONGLY AGREE ; 4=STRONGLY DISAGREE Students Faculty I am usually able to find the information I need in our library's collections 1.60 1.86 The library's collections support the learning goals of my program(s) 1.50 1.84 The library participates in cooperative agreements to expand user access to library and information resources. The library is part of a Portland academic health libraries consortium (PAHL) that includes Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU), University of Western States (UWS), and Oregon College of Oriental Medicine (OCOM). This consortium shares a l ibrary automation system and members enjoy full reciprocity for circulation of materials. In addition, the library has reciprocity agreements with Linfield College Portland and Birthingway School of Midwifery. The major academic library consortium in the region is the Orbis Cascade Alliance, with members including OHSU and the University of Washington. For NUNM, membership cost has outweighed potential benefits to date, but the university librarian reevaluates this decision regularly as new academic program s are implemented. (2.E.1) One of the most significant challenges the library faces is its small size. Options for expanding the physical footprint of the library within its current location are limited. Work continues to leverage use of the existing space to maximize and optimize collection and study space. Since the Year 3 report, 40% of the library's task chairs have been replaced, two large window wells were converted into individual study nooks, and an underutilized study table was replaced with a six -seat lounge seating area. Options for further leveraging NWCCU Year Seven Report 84 2/7/17 Standard Two - Resources and Capacity existing space are being explored with an interior designer. Library survey data indicates that these upgrades impact the usability of the space, but it is clear that a larger library is sorely needed and is projected in the Campus Master Plan. Student satisfaction with the amount of group study space is low, with a rating of 2.82 on a 4 -point scale. In an open -ended question, almost one -third (32%) of all suggestions for improving the library centered on the need for more s pace. The campus -wide student satisfaction survey shows satisfaction with library services is high relative to other campus services (8.19/10), but satisfaction with library space is decreasing. Currently, the library can seat approximately 11% of the s tudent population. Our short term improvement goal is 15%, vs. the best practices standard of 20 -25%, a long term goal projected to be achieved by constructing the new library projected in the Master Plan. The library's current physical footprint could be enlarged by pushing the single exterior wall out to enclose additional space; that remodel would likely prove too costly at present. There are several possible ways to better utilize the existing space, including moving reference materials from the center of the front room to wall shelving. Opening up that space would permit additional tables for individual and collaborative study. Another possibility would be to reclaim space from lower -use collections, such as print journals or audiovisual materials. T here may be opportunities on the first floor of the Academic Building for housing relocated materials or additional student study space. Most of these options would require repurposing of Academic Building rooms, a decision that would be made strategicall y with all institutional goals in mind. (2.E.1) Recommendation: Continue to review short - and long -term options for expansion of library space and budget improvements in coming years. Recommendation: Continue to monitor student satisfaction with and make improvements as needed to student study space. The table below provides results of a survey in May 2016 concerning student satisfaction with library facility resources. Library and other student satisfaction survey data is available on campus. (2. E.1) STUDENT SATISFACTION WITH LIBRARY RESOURC ES (FACILITIES ) ON A FOUR -POINT SCALE ; 1=VERY SATISFIED ; 4=VERY DISSATISFIED Area Mean response Printing options 1.47 Scanning options 1.80 Access to power outlets 1.74 Amount of group study space 2.82 Group study space features (furniture, technology, etc.) 2.30 New study \"nooks\" in window wells 1.32 Another critical area for ongoing evaluation is library staffing. In recent years the print and electronic collections have grown significantly, as described above, and requests for digital collections are expected to become more frequent. At the same time, library instruction and other services to students and faculty have expanded. Library staffing has not kept pace. As library resources and service s continue to grow, we will need to add staff. Areas of focus will be instruction and electronic/digital collections management (2.E.1). Recommendation: 2017 -18 budget request for an additional 0.75 FTE, professional librarian position with primary respo nsibility of managing electronic resources and digital initiatives, with additional responsibility of contributing to reference and instruction services. Such budgetary requests are given consideration as part of an assessment of university expense priori ties and projected revenue for that fiscal year. NWCCU Year Seven Report 85 2/7/17 Standard Two - Resources and Capacity The library has a broad spectrum of strategies in place for gathering data and feedback to support planning for library and information resources. The library participates in the university -wide strategic p lanning process, which includes annual goals and assessments. Assessment data are used for both planning and evaluation of goals. The Library Assessment Plan 2016 -17 is available on campus. (2.E.2) The library uses both formal and informal methods as par t of the planning process. For example, suggestions for additions to the print and electronic collections are taken on an individual basis, via verbal, email, or website request, but are also solicited more formally through the Library Committee or the program deans. Usage of and satisfaction with the collections is tracked annually using holdings and circulation data, usage reports for electronic collections, and the library survey. (2.E.2) A variety of changes to the library space have been made since th e Year Three report based on library survey feedback. Comments about uncomfortable chairs resulted in a strategic planning goal of replacing the oldest seating in the library; also a color printer was added based on survey data (82% student agreement with the statement \"I wish the library had a color printer\") and numerous verbal requests. In summer 2016 the library responded to user demand for more lounge seating by replacing an underutilized study table with a lounge seating area. (2.E.2) The library sup ports the educational mission and programs of the university by providing instruction and support to users in accessing and using information. The library is open 80 hours per week, and a library staff member is available during all open hours for unschedu led help or instruction. During the 2015 -16 academic year, library staff answered over 5,000 questions, including nearly 1,500 reference questions and over 1,400 technology questions. The ability of library staff to assist students with technology is an important factor in their success, as the library is one of the few recognized places on campus for such help. (2.E.3) In addition to informal, individualized instruction, library staff provide formal instruction in accessing and using information resources . Since the Year 3 report, the library's instruction program has expanded with the growth in university program offerings. Course -embedded, librarian -led instruction now occurs in most academic programs at both the graduate and undergraduate levels. In co llaboration with course faculty, instruction sessions are designed to support course outcomes and include assessments that inform future instruction. Assessment data support the value of information literacy instruction. For example, in fall 2016, the perc entage of first -year ND students able to cite a resource both authoritative and efficient for answering a sample case question rose from 1% before library instruction to 76% after. Library instruction at NUNM is driven by program design as well as individ ual faculty members recognizing its value and requesting instruction for their students. Library staff continue to expand the instruction program with the goal of a comprehensive, outcomes -based program in all university educational programs. (2.E.3) Library services also include information and resources to support faculty teaching. Library staff assist faculty on request with needs such as database search strategy and understanding copyright law, but also through services like interlibrary loan and t echnology checkouts. Occasionally library staff will offer a more formal instruction session to faculty on a particular topic, such as best practices for presentations, including citation style, copyright, and using images. The Library Committee includes f aculty members from each of the programs, which helps library staff stay current on faculty needs. (2.E.3) Recently the library subscribed to Springshare's LibGuides software, enhancing instruction and support in the online space. Beginning fall 2016, Lib rary Guides were published on the library website covering topics such as AMA citation style and copyright. The library also partnered with the Office of Student Life to create guides on test -taking and study tips. End user input is sought during guide cre ation, and usage will be monitored as part of the library's assessment plan. This platform promises to be a valuable tool in meeting instructional needs wherever students and faculty are located, an important strategic consideration NWCCU Year Seven Report 86 2/7/17 Standard Two - Resources and Capacity as education moves onli ne. (2.E.3) Until recently, assessment focused largely on traditional library metrics, including collections holdings data, circulation and interlibrary loan statistics and reference question statistics. These data were supplemented with informal feedback , mostly suggestions and requests delivered verbally or via email. Until 2010, the library conducted its own satisfaction survey, but paused that practice in favor of focusing on student learning outcomes. In 2014, the library's approach to assessment cha nged with the hiring of a new library director. An assessment plan was developed for the first time, outlining a comprehensive approach to library services evaluation. The plan is organized around collections, services, facilities, and fiscal and human resources. (2.E.4) Within the framework of the assessment plan, work is ongoing to build a robust and integrated approach to evaluation. The library survey was reinstated in 2015, and many other assessment activities, feedback mechanisms, and tracking method s have been added. For example, website usage statistics guide changes to the library's online presence, and gate count data is collected as needed to evaluate open hours. Where indicated, library staff also collect user feedback using micro -assessments. I n spring 2016, staff designed a \"participatory design walk -up workshop\" to engage users in redesigning a study area in the library. The most popular design was implemented in the library for the fall start of the school year. Student satisfaction with libr ary space and services are also evaluated as part of the university -wide student satisfaction survey. (2.E.4) STANDARD 2.F. FINANCIAL RESOURCES The board requires that the institution submit and maintain a balanced cash budget and monitors it monthly. The university has adopted a budget that provides for sufficient revenue to cover necessary educational and general expenses. A financial reserve e qual to approximately 5% of tuition revenue is maintained to ensure sufficient cash in case of enrollment fluctuations. Additionally, there is a line of credit with Pacific Continental Bank should an unanticipated expense arise. Current cash reserves equa l about 2 \u00bd months of operations; the goal is to have six months in reserve. (2.F.1) Both principal and interest payments are included as part of the budgeting process on future debt. In late fall 2015, in anticipation of the clinic purchase agreement co ming due, the university reviewed all of its long term debt obligations with its banks and solicited an RFP to achieve the best possible debt structure in light of its obligations and capital needs for the next three -to-five years. The university selected Pacific Continental Bank to assemble a new SNAP bond with the State of Oregon in the amount of $13M that consolidated all of our existing debt at a substantially lower interest rate. This reduced the amount of interest by $110K per year. In addition, over $2M of new capital was made available to facilitate renovations of the services building and the administration wing. (2.F.1) The university maintains a building fund reserve in excess of $1M, a deferred maintenance reserve of about $245K, with operation s reserves of a few million dollars. (2.F.1) Departments and programs submit sources of revenue and levels of expenditures to deliver programs and service. Projected enrollment is analyzed by admissions and monitored by a multitude of individuals on a weekly basis. The registrar and dean of students monitor graduation, retention rates and attrition on a monthly basis. In addition, there are significant contingencies to guard against unexpected changes in enrollment. (2.F.2) The university does not inclu de unrestricted grants and donations in its budget projections. Non -tuition revenue is generated from the NUNM Clinic, the NUNM Store, and research grants. The grants are budgeted only if a contract is in hand; the Store is budgeted based on a break -even b asis; and clinic revenue NWCCU Year Seven Report 87 2/7/17 Standard Two - Resources and Capacity is analyzed monthly by the executive director of clinic operations, and the director for ancillary services. (2.F.2) The annual budget planning process is a collaborative effort between senior administration and the management tea m. It begins in late January and concludes with final board adoption of the budget at the June board meeting. (The board includes a student and a faculty representative who participate in discussion.) The management team is defined as all stakeholders with budgetary authority and responsibility. In this process, they are given a set of assumptions and, based on an analysis of their input, senior administration recommends tuition and enrollment projections for the following year. Once accepted by the board, the management team develops revenue and spending forecasts for the following year, with input regarding departmental and institutional priorities. These are then assessed against the master and strategic plans and the board's key progress indicators and prior projections. After senior administration has reviewed and determined the final numbers, the budget is presented to the board for final approval and becomes part of the annual business plan, which is distributed in June. (2.F.3) The financial accou nting system is a fund accounting package from Sage Software that has been in place since 2001 and is prepared in -house. The payroll module, added in 2004, fully integrates with the general ledger. The system was moved to the Cloud in 2015 to enhance sec urity and disaster recovery. (2.F.4) The SONIS student records system integrates registration, financial aid, and student billings, and produces reports that are manually entered into the financial system. (2.F.4) The clinic uses Epic, the electronic hea lth records system (EHR), implemented in 2012. This software manages clinic insurance and patient billing which are automatically generated as a result of the patient visit. (2.F.4) The financial systems rely on a clear separation of duties to strengthen the series of internal controls, as required by the board and audited by our external auditors. (2.F.4) The university adopted its long range master plan in 2012 to provide a blueprint for future campus development and growth. When the board approves a c apital project the related budget reflects the estimates to construct/renovate/outfit and run that particular project. There is usually an architectural design that is costed out by the contractor. The department requesting the capital suggests the list o f equipment needs for functioning. Depending upon the nature of the project, external funding is in place prior to construction, or a plan is approved by the board to advance institutional funds to complete the project until other monies are raised to repl ace it. In those cases where the institution has borrowed money to complete a project, the board has reviewed the underlying assumptions and has assessed the necessity for such borrowing and understands the methods by which the funds will be repaid. (2.F.5 ) Debt for capital outlay purposes is periodically reviewed, carefully controlled and justified, so as not to create an unreasonable drain on resources available for educational purposes. The institution's debt is annually reviewed as part of the budgetin g process, and estimates of required principal and interest payments as defined in the debt instruments are budgeted. Separately, the CFO consults with our financial institutions on ways to restructure the debt to obtain the best possible financing. (2.F.5 ) (See also discussion at the beginning of this section.) The institution runs two types of auxiliary enterprises: the NUNM Store and the clinics. The store is run on a break -even basis, and no general operating funds are used to support it. Clinical o perations consist of three distinct units: the lab, the medicinary and patient visits. The lab is operated on a fee -for-service basis, the intent being that patients pay for the costs of the lab work. The lab runs a break -even operation and sometimes makes a profit that goes to support the general overhead of the university. The medicinary runs NWCCU Year Seven Report 88 2/7/17 Standard Two - Resources and Capacity similarly: the customer is charged for the cost and the margin has to cover the operation of the medicinary, including overhead. The clinic, however, is a teaching clinic whose purpose is not only patient care but student education. As such, the costs of the clinic are subsidized by student tuition to the extent that patient fees are set below market to attract sufficient patients for ample medical education. This su bsidy is reviewed annually as part of the budget process and monitored monthly by the Board Finance Committee and the administration. (2.F.6) The institution has retained the services of Hoffman, Stewart & Schmidt, PC , which has audited the books annually since 2001. The field work for the financial audit (enclosed separately) is usually completed in 10 days, and the results are provided in draft form to the board within two months of the field work and are published in the university's annual report in time for the November board meeting. The results from the audit, including findings, are provided to the Board Finance Committee, which may elect to meet separately with the auditors. The committee endorses the audit and sends it to the full board for approval and a decision as to who the next auditor should be. The board retains the audit firm and traditionally does it at the time of approval of the audit. Any findings by the auditors are resolved in a management response; corrective action plans are published in the audit document, which is sent to the U.S. DOE. (2.F.7) NUNM is a 501(c)(3) organization and therefore a trustee of charitable dollars. Fundraising activities fall under the purview of the vice president of advancement, who has managed fundraising at NUNM since 2002. All activities are conducted in a professional and ethical manner and comply with government requirements. Policies and procedures governing the institution's fundraising activities are found on PolicyStat. (2.F.8) The university's fundraising activities are open to scrutiny at all times by stake -holders , regulatory bodies, and the public. The ethical treatment of donors and donations is of utmost priority as we conduct the business of the Advancement Department. We ensure: Our donors share our vision, mission, and values Donations go directly toward t he intended purpose as determined by the donor Communication to donors from NUNM is timely, appropriate, researched, accurate, and clear Privacy and confidentiality for donors is respected and assured Mailing lists are never sold, traded, or shared Relevan t financial information is made available upon request from donors Tax receipts are issued according to IRS and NUNM policy, accurately and on time Online transactions occur through a safe and private secure system. (2.F.8) All donations in cash and in -kind are fully audited annually by an independent auditing firm, and the results are reported to the NUNM Board of Directors. Quarterly reports are written to the board apprising them of the goals, strategies, and outcomes of fundraising campaigns. (2.F.8) STANDARD 2.G. PHYSICAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL INFRASTRUCTURE National University of Natural Medicine is located south of the main Portland downtown area, accessible by car and public transportation. The majority of the university's activities take place in thr ee ADA - compliant buildings in close proximity. (2.G.1) The Academic Building, constructed in 1912, is a 60,000 square foot masonry and brick three -story building located at 049 SW Porter Street that serves as NUNM's academic center. It is ADA -upgraded with an elevator and wheelchair accessible restrooms and doors. Although initially all non -clinical functions occupied this facility, it currently houses only a few administrative functions, in addition to its primary academic function: security, audio -visual, library and library offices, NUNM Store, conference room, NWCCU Year Seven Report 89 2/7/17 Standard Two - Resources and Capacity classical Chinese medicine faculty and administrative office, and some ND faculty space. There are t wo student study areas, as well as a computer lab for clinic software instruction. (2.G.1) The anatomical dissection lab, located in the Academic Building, has a customized air system to minimize instructor and student exposure to chemicals used in cadaver preservation, custom -made tables for cadaver storage, human skeleton models and an X -ray viewer. Similarly, the acupuncture practice room has a customized air system to minimize exposure to moxibustion smoke. The wet lab is equipped with lab tables , microscopes, a refrigerator, biohazard equipment, and personal protective equipment appropriate to a lab classroom. (2.G.1) The 24,433 square foot Administration Building is ADA -upgraded with an elevator and wheelchair - accessible restrooms and doors. Th e lower level contains Student Life, IT, Admissions, and the Counseling Center. The main level is occupied by the Business Office, Human Resources, Registrar, Financial Aid, Institutional Research, ND Administration and most of the ND faculty. The top floo r houses offices of the president, provost, VP finance/CFO, VP advancement, and AVP enrollment management. It also houses the primary meeting/board room for the campus. (2.G.1) During summer 2016, storage space adjacent to the Administration Building unde rwent extensive renovation to create office space in which to move facilities, community clinic administration, SIBO lab, the chief of security, ancillary services director, and clinic billing. These offices were previously housed in the Service Building. The newly renovated space has been christened the Stone -Bleything Wing in honor of two of the three founders of NUNM. The Spaulding House (named in honor of the third founder of NUNM) accommodates our NUNM institutes: Age Wise Institute; Food As Medicine Institute; Traditional Roots Institute; Women in Balance Institute, and the Geezer Gallery. The Gallery supports artists over 55 years of age and is run by a gerontologist who also leads the Age Wise Institute. (2.G.1) The NUNM Health Center -Lair Hill, with 18,000 square feet, is an integrated clinic that meets the needs of both the ND and CCM programs and houses the offices of the chief medical officer, the executive director of NUNM health centers, and the Epic software manager. The following list high lights some of the major features of the on -campus teaching clinic: Upgraded HVAC system to include economizers, which bring in outside air for heating and cooling Better ventilation in treatment rooms for moxa treatments High efficiency lighting No-VOC pa int Ceiling tiles with 90% recycled material Floors stained with Soycretetm, an environmentally friendly floor treatment made with soy beans Expanded space for lab and retail areas Adjacent garden landscaping consisting mostly of Chinese and naturopathic medicinal plants.

The 6,000 square foot Betty Radelet Hall is located one block north of the Academic Building, and serves as the university's largest lecture hall, with occupancy approaching 200 students. It includes a remote learning/baby room adjacent to the main lecture hall, and a small kitchen and two restrooms . (2.G.1) The Helfgott Research Institute and Community Education Center, with 8,390 square feet, is the primary teaching and lab space for the School of Research and Graduate Studies. Its location is approximately three blocks north of the campus footprint and includes office space, a classroom for research instruction, a research laboratory, and a state -of-the-art teaching kitchen. (2.G.1) NUNM places an emphasis on improving classrooms and academic facilities, enhancing safety and security, and addressing deferred maintenance backlogs. Since our Year Three Report in 2014, there have been several major construction projects: Creation of an Information Center in the Academic Building Establishment of a Student Common Room/SGA office which also se rves as a student lounge Remodeling of the minor surgery room Installation of air conditioning in Mitchell Hall, the largest lecture hall in the Academic Building Waterproofing and new downspouts on the north side of the Academic Building as part of continued maintenance. Renovation of the Stone -Bleything Wing. (2.G.1) Additional exterior lighting was installed in 2012 -13, and also in 2015 and 2016. Security cameras were installed throughout campus beginning in 2014. Currently, there are 21 cameras in o peration. These security upgrades followed review of priorities expressed through the Safety Committee as well as through student satisfaction surveys. The university researched a program to institute energy savings through facility upgrades in the Acade mic and Administration Buildings. An energy audit of both buildings was conducted in 2014 and 2015 and showed that significant savings could be made through modifications to the HVAC and lighting systems in both buildings. The project was submitted to the Energy Trust, but since NWCCU Year Seven Report 91 2/7/17 Standard Two - Resources and Capacity the Trust declined to fund any of the projects, the university has yet to embark on these upgrades. (2.G.1) NUNM is using long -term capital planning to diagnose project priorities and funding needs and sources. The goals outlined i n the campus master plan will continue growing the campus in a manner that not only serves the academic needs of the university but also honors NUNM's purpose: \"To promote and exemplify health, sustainable living and self -healing through education, researc h and service.\" (2.G.1) The NUNM Safety Committee, composed of faculty, staff, and students and chaired by the director of security, meets monthly to ensure compliance, address problems brought forward by the community, and discuss issues such as employee and student training, ergonomics, and security. NUNM complies with regulations established by local, state and federal agencies, including Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA), Multnomah County Health Department, U.S. Food and Drug Admini stration, Portland Fire Bureau, Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industry, Americans with Disabilities Act, Oregon Administrative Rules, and insurance risk management. (2.G.2) The chief medical officer ensures safe practices and policies in both the clinical an d academic settings. This position is responsible for investigating accidents on campus and serves as the exposure control officer when dealing with needle sticks or other blood borne pathogens. The CMO also reviews and revises relevant policies as necessa ry. The Bloodborne Pathogens Policy, available on site, addresses policy and procedures for the identification and disposal of substance waste. Biohazard waste is collected by an outside contractor monthly. Electronic waste is managed by the IT department . Used fluorescent lights are recycled through an outside contractor. Paint and other waste materials are taken to Metro for recycling. (2.G.2) The NUNM Campus Master Plan was unanimously approved without modification by the City of Portland on Septembe r 19, 2012. With this milestone approval, the university is empowered by civic and regional officials to implement its long term strategic plan to establish a green, integrated, and sustainable campus. As part of this effort, NUNM continues to collaborate with state and regional agencies to enhance transportation developments and improvements around our now established campus footprint. The Master Plan documents strategic planning for the next 20 years and sets out potential vision and action plans for the physical appearance of the campus. The plan covers an area of 5.4 acres, of which the university owns 80% of the land. We will work towards implementation of the phased projects as resources become available; an immediate gain is the inclusion and ackno wledgement of NUNM in the City's future plans for the campus area. (2.G.3) The rollout of the phases of implementing the master plan has been continuously updated from the official document found on our website ( http://NUNM.edu/about -NUNM/campus -master -plan-2012 -2022/ ), consistently enhancing and aligning the university's needs with the city's as well as our neighbors' concerns and priorities. For example, Phase 1 of this nuanced implementation was to acquire the necessary properties in the campus footprint, and those parcel acquisitions have been largely completed. (2.G.3) A priority in the strategic plan through the approved master plan allows NUNM to develop a high level of serviceability and repair for all facilities and equipment; environmentally sustainable improvements in energy utilization, air quality and control; and utilization of building and repair materials. Since 2013 the university has accomplished sever al features of the master plan. (2.G.3) Below are some of these accomplishments. NUNM has repurposed the former clinic building into the Helfgott Research Institute, including a state of the art teaching and research kitchen, science lab, principal investi gator office facilities, and research conference and participant testing and activity space. Further, the Helfgott Research Institute building supports the School of Graduate Studies (four graduate programs) in terms of NWCCU Year Seven Report 92 2/7/17 Standard Two - Resources and Capacity faculty and administrative space and provides a state -of-the-art classroom. We purchased the house located at 2828 Water Street, renamed the Spaulding House, which is home to the NUNM Institutes and used for university events. Galen's Way garden, an expansion of green space with a sustaina ble food garden, was created on campus. The former administration building storage annex was repurposed into a new, sustainable office wing named the Stone -Bleything Wing, housing the business services divisions of the university. HVAC was installed in Mit chell Hall. NUNM is moving forward with the approval process for the street vacation of lower Hooker Street, a cul -de-sac located adjacent to the Spaulding house. The final outcome will be to transform the vacated street into a sustainable food forest/ p ark-like setting within the grounds of the university. The university has had pressing needs for additional space due to program expansion. The $2M included in the SNAP refinancing provided funds for the renovation of the Stone -Bleything Wing (previously t he administration building storage annex) in early fall. Staff have been moved into the new wing. We are considering whether to renovate the Services Building (storage warehouse with some offices) or to build an addition onto our Academic Center Building. The renovated building might house a second campus teaching kitchen (made possible through a donation of $350K from the Barlean's company), several new classrooms, a rehab clinic and equipment room for the newly - approved graduate sports medicine program, a small student lounge and faculty offices. (2.G.3) NUNM was accorded university status by the Higher Education Coordinating Commission (HECC) of the State of Oregon and by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities, effective February 19, 2016 and announced July 1, 2016. NUNM is now branded as NUNM. We matriculated our first two Bachelor degree cohorts in fall 2016, utilizing classroom space in the existing academic building. (2.G.3) The new academic center building described in Phase 1 is o n hold pending the securing of funding, as is the remodel of the Annex Building (now named Radelet Hall) described in Phase 2. Phase 1 of the original plan also included the establishment of student housing facilities on campus. The president and the VP of advancement continue to develop a plan around building a student residence hall that will not encumber university tuition revenue. The university retained a consulting firm whose report on the feasibility of a student residence facility was favorable. The priority option is a model in which the developer invests 100% of the capital for this project with a 25 -30 year ROI from rental income. The university would provide a long term lease on the land and work with the city regarding zoning and permitting, as well as include the facility in its student services outreach. The entire master plan document can be viewed on the NUNM website . (2.G.3) Each classroom and lecture hall is equipped wi th appropriate furniture and AV/instructional technology equipment. Numerous lecture halls have permanently installed audio systems, ceiling mounted digital projectors, computers, and other requisite instructional equipment. Physical medicine labs are equ ipped with massage tables, manipulation tables, skeleton models and other specialized equipment. The herb/diet lab was designed to teach botanical medicine, herbal and diet classes. It is equipped with a sink, drying racks, worktables with electrical hook -ups, and other associated equipment. (2.G.4) A majority of the students at NUNM are between the ages of 25 and 34. Since many are married and have children, support for families is a high priority. The university provides parents of infants, especially nursing parents, access to some academic courses via an approved \"remote room\". An additional remote room was included in the newest academic building, Radelet Hall. Resources have been allocated to ensure that the remote rooms allow for parents with young children to receive an equivalent education in the NWCCU Year Seven Report 93 2/7/17 Standard Two - Resources and Capacity courses that are approved for remote viewing. In response to parent concerns regarding student space dedicated to lactation and children -friendly areas, the university created a Family Room with couches, easy chairs, tables and chairs for both adults and kids as a study space for families with babies. A refrigerator is also provided in the lactation area of the Family Room. The remote room in the Academic Building continues to provide a private space for l actation. (2.G.4) As discussed earlier, there is a designated classroom used for \"energy medicine\" where qigong and taiji courses are taught. The energy medicine room provides a space for students to relax, exercise, and rest during their many hours on c ampus. (2.G.4) Furnishings and equipment needs and upgrades are included in the short - and long -term budget planning processes. The program deans and other administrators advise of needs in facilities and IT, which are also incorporated into the budget pl anning process. If a critical piece of equipment needs to be replaced after the budget is set, the department head would either use funds from the department budget or, in the case of insufficient funding, would seek approval for new funds. Classroom furni shings and equipment are also updated upon room remodels. The university uses a fixed asset inventory system, which ties physical inventory into the financial accounting system and also calculates depreciation. The Business Office conducts an annual inspec tion with the campus facilities staff that documents the existence and location of all equipment and furnishings and updates its records. (2.G.4) The results from the spring 2016 student satisfaction survey indicate continuing high satisfaction for the teaching kitchen and Helfgott research and lab facilities. The Testing Center, which was recently created, had a sizeable increase in satisfaction. Areas of most concern were parking, study space, outdoor dining and student lounge. Study space and student lounge space were reduced to increase classroom space, which may account for the lower scores. A family room was created in the former Bookstore area as a lounge/study space in summer 2016. A recommendation as regards study space is within the library sect ion of Standard Two. Satisfaction with outdoor dining, although low, showed a conspicuous increase from the previous year. Parking is limited by the campus footprint and difficult to remedy. In 2016, an additional question about off -campus parking reveale d that most students either wouldn't park off campus, or feel uns ure about the prospect. (2.G.4) UNIVERSITY FACILITIES WITH COMPARISON BY YEAR ON A SCALE OF 1(LOW )-10 (HIGH ), PLEASE RATE YOUR SAT ISFACTION WITH THE FOLLOWING FACILITIES 2016 % \"do not use this facility\" 2016 Mean 2015 Mean 2014 Mean 2013 Mean Classroom facilities; N=260 0.0% - - Remote - - Seven Report 94 2/7/17 Standard Two - Resources and Capacity Parking lot lighting and security; N=227 13.0% 6.79 7.08 7.42 7.33 On Campus Parking availability*; N=230 19.0% 3.84 3.80 5.20 5.14 Overall N=263 6.82 7.05 *Parking refers only to NUNM parking lots. The city of Portland controls street parking. Training materials, texts, and classroom materials rate very well, whereas satisfaction with equipment shows some room for improvement. Every area showed a small, but steady decline in the past two years. This may indicate a need for improved resources in the coming years, or better communication of the resources available. The ND program showed a more significant need for updated equipment, as well as quality and quantity of equipment. In many cases the current equipment is in need of repair, and medical updates to medical education mean that NUNM will need to make significant investments in equipment over the next few years. The ND program dean was authorized to update much of the physical medicine equipment over the last year, and we have contracted with OHSU simulation lab to provide simulation exposure to our students. As of fall 2016 the physical medicine faculty report that they have nearly everything they would like to have (minus an updated diathermy machine). (2.G.4) The table below provides an ov erview of student satisfaction with program resources for the last four years.

This consists of 13 physical servers, 11 virtual servers, 435 computer workstations, and 154 printers. Workstations have the ability to print to copie rs, and copiers can be used to scan paper to electronic files sent via email. (2.G.5) Students have access to 29 public computer workstations and 13 printers in and around the NUNM Library and an additional 22 computer workstations dedicated for student u se in the computer lab. The computer lab is equipped with a projector and screen, enabling the facility to be used for campus training, for example, on the use of the EPIC software. Seventeen classrooms are equipped with a computer and ceiling -mounted projector and screen with the larger classrooms being equipped with sound system, DVD player, and laptop connectivity for both Macintosh and PC laptops. Camtasia is installed in eight classroom computers and is used to record presentations and lectures. (2.G.5 ) NUNM standardizes on Microsoft products campus wide. Hewlett Packard (HP) and Lenovo server hardware are the standard hardware platform used to deliver information services to our students, staff, faculty, and administrators. Standardization allows the Information Technology Department to keep maintenance of the software and hardware at a manageable level. When deemed necessary, IT upgrades, NWCCU Year Seven Report 95 2/7/17 Standard Two - Resources and Capacity replaces, or installs new server systems and configures and secures them according to Microsoft best practice stan dards. To ensure data survival, backup of all NUNM data onto backup media is done and stored both off -site and in waterproof/fireproof storage on site. (2.G.5) The institution maintains three dedicated server rooms where redundant power supply hardware is utilized on all servers to protect against power issues, and utilizes HP and Cisco devices on its network. Fiber optics are used to provide connectivity between buildings as well as between floors in the Academic Building. CAT5 copper is used for the last leg to our end devices. Network devices are also connected to battery backup supplies that afford a minimum of 15 minutes of power in case of a power failure. (2.G.5) Wireless network connectivity is provided to students, staff, faculty, and administrato rs in all buildings on campus and has standardized its wireless infrastructure to 802.11n. Although there are areas on campus where there is little to no signal, the goal is to provide full wireless coverage to all classrooms and study spaces. The network is connected to the Internet via a 100Mbit fiber optic connection through Integra Telecom. NUNM uses a Watchguard firewall to prevent unauthorized access to its internal network, and also utilizes the Watchguard firewall to separate the student network fro m staff, faculty, and administrator networks. (2.G.5) The IT department creates or obtains necessary training materials based on observed needs or requests from faculty, students, staff, and administrators in the event that new services or technologies ar e introduced to the environment. Resources range from documentation uploaded and posted on NUNM's Intranet site to media tutorials posted within NUNM's course management system to personal one -on-one based training from an IT staff member. IT Services are included in the annual student satisfaction survey and are rated highly by respondents. The table below provides an overview of mean responses.

ITT discusses IT related issues and the prioritization for IT activities and communicates to the campus about the IT activities. The team has representatives from students, faculty, clinic, business office, li brary, marketing, student life, and the NUNM Store . Meeting minutes are written and posted on the internal Moodle website. (2.G.7) NUNM reviews and updates Technology Plan annually (appendix 2.3 ). It includes any needs for replacing network backbone and edge services. Computer Purchasing and Replacement Policy ( available on campus) has been developed and implemented to provide guidance for the replacement of computer systems. (2.G.8) NWCCU Year Seven Report 96 2/7/17 Standard Three - Planning and Implementation STANDARD THREE - PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION STANDARD 3.A. INSTITUTIONAL PLANNING The NUNM Strategic Plan is reflected in the Framework for Action , which has unfolded in three phases of five year segments: Phase 1 (2007 -2012); Phase 2 (2012 -2017), providing the framework for the current seven year NWCCU cycle; and Phase 3 (2017 -2022), which will interact with the next seven year accreditation cycle. (3.A.1) The Framework includes Key Progress Indicators (KPIs) created by the board and expressed as action items in the university's budget and strategic planning cycles. These KPIs are institutional priorities that are reviewed by the board annually and by the administrative team on an ongoing basis. Based upon these KPIs, individual departments annually and, as needed, prepare departmental goals that are tied to the KPIs, Core Themes, and to measurable assessment targets. Included within the departmental goals and tactics are the major educational goals of the degree programs. Results of the assessments and achievement of goals are also identified within departmental plans. The se interwoven processes are tracked through a database , SPOL (Strategic Planning Online ), directed by the Office of Institutional Research and Compliance (IRC). Through the strategic planning and institutional assessment processes, resources are allocated to support the goals and objectives for the current and future planning cycles. Administrators and staff implement the strategies leading to fulfillment of the KPIs as part of a multiyear effort. Reports and exhibits can be generated on campus from SPOL reflecting the tracking of these planning processes (3.A.1, 3.A.2) . Communication is crucial for this model to work. The communication and administrative structure is designed to provide members of the community with the opportunity to participate in the planning efforts of the institution. The board includes non -voting constituency representatives elected by the Faculty Senate, Staff Council, and Student Government Association. Board committees include participation by administrators in order to enhance c ommunication and connection within the institution and to support the embodiment of purpose, vision, and values in the decisions made . In addition, the board periodically provides informal opportunities for faculty and students to interact with board memb ers toward building a collegial environment so that constituency representatives are more comfortable with providing input to the board. (3.A.2) NUNM utilizes a combination of a hierarchical management structure, as reflected by the organizational chart (appendix 2.4), with a team planning and operations model 2017 -22 (appendix 3.1). The organizational framework was designed to ensure communication and planning efforts toward the development and successful implementation of institutional, programmatic, an d departmental goals in support of NUNM 's teaching and learning environment. The Alignment Model (see graphic and discussion in Standard One , page 3 3) was established to root all activities of the university in the purpose, values, and mission of the ins titution, setting the stage for an operation that has integrity and coherence. D epartmental plans of action, including corresponding budget allocations or requests, are aligned with the institution's mission and goals and the Core Themes. The structure o f the institution delineates the appropriate chain of command, promotes the efficient use of personnel, and the team interaction necessary to facilitate appropriate planning, successful implementation, and assessment and revision of common goals and object ives. (3.A.1, 3.A.2) The Board Strategic Pathways Committee initiates strategic planning processes for the board and is the catalyst for strategic planning processes of the university. The committee and its role were reevaluated at the November 2015 board retreat, taking into consideration current priorities of the board, as well as discussions influenced by its membership in the Association of Governing Boards (AGB). The potential revisions to the Bylaws under review anticipate changing the name to the Strategic Planning Committee. (3.A.1, 3.A.2) NWCCU Year Seven Report 97 2/7/17 Standard Three - Planning and Implementation The Finance and Administrative Affairs Committee (FAAC) of the board meets at least four times annually and is chaired by the treasurer of the board. The committee is responsible for overseeing the financi al affairs of the university, monitoring the adequacy and condition of capital assets, developing and reviewing policies, ensuring adequate funding for maintenance, recommending for board approval the external auditor, and monitoring fulfillment of the rec ommendations of the auditor. The committee also assists the chief financial officer in general operation of the fiscal affairs of the university such as budget development, the investment and application of all funds and properties received by the univers ity, and the continuous updating of the Framework for Action Five-Year -Plan for the use of financial resources to meet the fiscal needs of the university. In addition to the treasur er, committee membership includes an additional one or more directors as well as the president and the chief financial officer. Vice presidents and academic leadership are also invited to and attend FAAC meetings. Actions taken by the committee that requi re full board approval are submitted for ratification at the next full board meeting. The annual budget that is approved by the board is reviewed at the quarterly meetings of this committee and as fluctuations dictate. The president and the CFO work with t he President's Cabinet, described below, in the ongoing review of the annual budget, and this group, in consultation with other administrators, makes recommendations for modifications to the annual budget, if needed, based upon unexpected changes in income , expenses, or unexpected priorities. Proposed modifications are vetted by the FAAC and approved at board meetings. Because of contingency funds within the budget such as for attrition, it has been many years since a budget needed to be adjusted down due t o unmaterialized income projections. In addition, pledged donations are not entered into the budget until they materialize. Both of these lend further flexibility to the budget for unanticipated situations. (3.A.1, 3.A.2, 3.A.3, 3.A.4) The President's C abinet, which replaced the College Planning Team, is charged with university operations in the context of the five -year strategic plan, the annual business plan, university policy, and emergent priorities. Per its mandate, the PC regularly monitors progres s toward implementation of the strategic plan. To improve interdepartmental planning, the membership of this committee was expanded in 2016 to include the recently promoted associate vice presidents in addition to the president and vice presidents. (3.A. 1, 3.A.2) The Campus Master Plan (adopted August 2012) documents strategic planning for the next 20 years and sets out potential vision and action plans for the physical appearance of the campus. The plan covers an area of 5.4 acres, of which the univers ity owns 80% of the land. NUNM implements the phased projects as resources become available. An immediate gain of the master plan is the inclusion and acknowledgement of NUNM in the City of Portland's future plans for the area surrounding the campus. (3. A.1, 3.A.4) On June 26, 2014, at its annual retreat, the board formally launched preparation for the 2017 -22 planning cycle in a brainstorming workshop - Vision & Voice 2022 Gathering. A cross section of administrators and staff were invited plus alumni, patients, suppliers, higher education associates, SGA, Faculty Senate and Staff Association representatives. Sessions were facilitated by board members who listen ed and recorded responses of participants to a number of questions. Available on campus is an overview of the input received and the resulting concepts carried back to the board. During 2014 to 2016, the Strategic Planning Committee of the board vetted st rategies quarterly and monthly meetings. The board continued to incorporate input from the brainstorming workshop during several additional gatherings of the board: Gathering 2, February 21, 2015, \"Moving our Boundaries\", a meeting of the board looking at KPIs; Gathering 3, at the November 2015 Board retreat; and Gathering 4, at the February 2016 board retreat. (3.A.1, 3.A.2) In fall 2016, community participation in the upcoming planning cycle continued through surveys and focus groups of students, employ ees, and alumni to capture input on five key strategies drafted by the board during its planning retreats t o guide the university for 2017 -22 in cultivating its core educational values for mission fulfillment. These strategies are designed to provide a cle ar path for administrators in the process of planning, budgeting, and implementing measurable departmental milestones and will provide a NWCCU Year Seven Report 98 2/7/17 Standard Three - Planning and Implementation launching point for creation of the goals, objectives and indicators for the next NWCCU seven year cycle. Results from the August and September surveys and an overview of the focus groups held on September 21 and September 23 are available on campus. A final draft of the Phase 3 2017 -2022 document is anticipated for board review during this academic year. (3.A.1, 3.A.2, 3.A.3) Data informs the institution's planning processes. One source of data is contained within reports to the Board of Directors from administrative units generated for its fall, winter, and spring meetings. These include: (3.A.3) A report from the provost with updates from all program deans on existing programs and potential programs under development, and current and upcoming accreditation processes. Matriculation, attrition, retention, and use of services data from the Office of Student Life. An admissions dashboard that has been generated at board request since 2009 (also made available monthly to NUNM departments). Advancement data, including the status of asks in play as well as donations pledged, expected, and received. Reports from the Student Government Association, Faculty Senate, and Staff Association. Updates on facilities and the campus master plan. Updated financial data resulting from changes to revenue and expenses, which, in addition to review by the full board, i s reviewed monthly by the FAAC. Examples of recent utilization by the board of such data include the following: (3.A.3, 3.A.4) Consideration of the structural stability of existing buildings in determining if modifications to properties should be made or if we should plan reconstruction. Addition to the budget of a deferred maintenance line item. Discussions concerning dedication of resources for student housing in a market with a shortage of rental property. Approval to fund upgrades to the Stone -Bleything Wing of the Administration Building to accommodate needed office space. Approval to utilize funds for creation of a second t eaching kitchen and space for a sports medicine program. Consideration of supporting the institutional mission of potential new programs and approval to proceed with submission of programs for accreditation. Approval through the budget process to launch n ew programs that have received accreditation approval taking into consideration issues such facilities and available services to students. Mission fulfillment remains at the core of board planning discussions, creating goals that support maintaining the c lassical roots of our medicines while positioning ourselves to be a leader in natural medicine. Based upon self -evaluation of their strengths and weaknesses in membership skills, the board has prioritized skillsets of new membership to fill weaker areas or replace expertise of board members who are rotating off. The decision by the board to join the Association of Governing Boards of Colleges and Universities (AGB) was based upon the resources provided to member institutions such as training in support of s kill development and industry standards. (3.A.1) At an administrative level, in fall 2016, library modifications were made as a result of student input (through satisfaction surveys and SGA representatives) indicating the desire for expanded study space within the library. (See Standard 2.E.1.) S oftware purchases were recommended and budgeted to assist the institution in the tracking of mission fulfillment. In the planning cycle for the 2015 -16 academic year, NUNM budgeted for and p urchased the eMedley curriculum management system to electronically track the NWCCU Year Seven Report 99 2/7/17 Standard Three - Planning and Implementation alignment of specific evaluation components (e.g. individual test questions) with specific course competencies, as well as program content area competencies and program learning outcomes. This purchase was made to improve capture of data to facilitate a more rigorous assessment of the level to which each of the program learning outcomes for our degree programs is being achieved, an important component of mission fulfillment. We us ed this system during the 2015 -16 academic year. However, with the decision to budget for a distance education platform that would improve upon the Moodle platform currently used by the institution, and taking into consideration ease of use by faculty, the contract with eMedley was not renewed in favor of a platform that would address both our assessment and learning platform needs. A task force of academic and other administrators narrowed the field to D2L and Canvas. The institution plans to budget the pu rchase of a learning platform that meets both distance education and assessment needs in 2017 -18. (3.A.1, 3.A.2, 3.A.3, 3.A.4) Similarly, in the 2015 -16 academic year, NUNM budgeted for, purchased, and implemented PolicyStat, software designed to support easier access to and management of policies and procedures. Through the purchase and implementation of this software, all policies, including clinical policies and procedures, are available in a cloud -based repository. The repository stores all prior vers ions of policies/procedures in an archive. All members of the community can access the repository to view current policies at any time. The software facilitates updates, revisions, and mandatory review of policies, as well as editorial and accountability processes. (3.A.1, 3.A.4) NUNM budgeted for and has purchased career development software that will track alumni information and preceptorship, career, and placement opportunities with a target implementation date of spring quarter 2017. In addition to s erving our students and alumni toward career success, the software will facilitate data collection for alumni placement, an indicator of mission fulfillment currently captured by survey data. This purchase was recommended by NUNM in its two recent specialt y accreditation self -study processes. (3.A.1, 3.A.3, 3.A.4) Emergency Preparedness (3.A.5 ) The campus emergency preparedness plan includes a Crisis Response Team (CRT) that convenes and runs drills on an ad hoc basis to address topics of concern, such a s swine or avian flu epidemics or an active shooter on campus. The campus has an emergency evacuation plan that was expanded by the director of security from a previous clinic evacuation plan developed by a private contractor. The director of security and the chief medical officer, together with the Safety Committee, review and revise policies as necessary. Some of the current and upcoming emergency objectives include: increasing emergency training offerings for faculty, staff, and students; a Continuation of Operations Plan (COOP), which covers a variety of potential disasters and looks to incorporate agreements with other local institutions to allow for classes to continue if facilities are severely damaged; changing the Emergency Notification System from opt-in to opt -out to encourage increased student enrollment in the system. Recent improvements include: additional emergency supplies to allow for sustained presence on campus after a large scale emergency; a table top drill on an active shooter scenario aimed at preparing the administration response; and continuing updates and improvements to the emergency response plan. Several drills including fire, earthquake and general evacuation are planned and implemented throughout the year. The written Emergency , Campus Evacuation, and Continuation of Operations (COOP) Plans are available for review on campus. NWCCU Year Seven Report 100 2/7/17 Standard Three - Planning and Implementation STANDARD 3.B.1 AND 3.B.2 CORE THEME PLANNING , ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS 22 AND 23 22. STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT The expected learning objectives for the degree programs offered by NUNM are regularly evaluated though a participatory process involving faculty, students and administration through the combined efforts of the Program and Curriculum Review Committee and the Academic O perations Team. The objectives of the Institutional Assessment Plan, which is overseen by the Institutional Assessment Committee are: Develop, implement, and revise as needed an ongoing institutional assessment program that monitors achievement of the ins titution's goals. Expand learning outcomes assessment by reviewing curriculum & programs using multiple indices. The Institutional Assessment Plan is closely interwoven w ith Departmental Strategic Plans. Copies of overviews of both are available on site. 23. INSTITUTIONAL EFFECTIVENESS The university's Strategic Plan ( A Framework for Action ) was created to support the mission and goals of the institution. Each objective within that plan has milestones and/or assessment criteria attached to an objective and is interwoven with the Core Themes and the Institutional Assessment Plan. The Institutional Assessment Committee is charged by the president to: work with administrators and faculty to implement the assessment plan; monitor the success of the plan's implementation; generate timely reports including communications to its constituencies regarding assessment data; revise the assessment plan on an ongoing basis. Utilization of Mission Fulfillment Data from Indicators for Core Themes The NUNM strategic plan, A Framework for Action , was developed to guide the institution in its achievement of its mission. Section two of the plan provides the action steps for the current five year set of goals and key progress indicators toward alignment and accomplishment of the goals. Each of the Cor e Themes was chosen by NUNM to provide greater clarification of mission fulfillment. NUNM tracks its efforts toward implementation of its strategic plan, assessment processes, and their interconnection with Core Themes through SPOL, our strategic planning data base. Appendix 0.1 provides a detailed narrative on each of the Core Themes and objectives, the indicators chosen, and an overview of data captured toward providing evidence of our level of Core Theme achievement. NUNM chose indicators from each o f its Core Themes toward assessment of mission fulfillment. These six indicators have become a source of guidance in NUNM's planning process toward mission fulfillment: Student attrition data (Core Theme One) First-time pass rates on clinical entrance a nd exit exams for students in the first professional degree programs (Core Theme Two) First-time pass rates for graduates of the first professional degree programs for the NPLEX (Naturopathic Medicine) and NCCAOM (Acupuncture and Herbal Medicine) licensing examinations (Core Theme Two) Mean responses for specifically targeted questions in program level annual exit surveys with questions designed toward understanding the level to which the curricula retain the classical roots of their medicines (Core Theme T wo) NWCCU Year Seven Report 101 2/7/17 Standard Three - Planning and Implementation Percentage of alumni who report they are employed in a field directly related to their NUNM degree (Core Theme Three) Alumni perception of how well NUNM prepared them for a career in their profession (Core Theme Three) Utilization of Indicators of Mission Success from Core Theme One: Support Student Success From this Core Theme we chose one indicator for mission fulfillment: Student attrition data. Student attrition and related data is a good indicator for mission fulfillment as well as planning f or the future. For example, compiled data indicated that transfer students and underrepresented students are more likely to be on academic probation than their peers, which can lead to dismissal or voluntary withdrawal. Student Life tracks the reasons st udents have left NUNM, which supports examination of the patterns that can lead to academic and behavioral challenges and, potentially, separation from the institution. Identification of patterns of comments in response to surveys such as the annual studen t satisfaction survey provides qualitative data in support of quantitative data such as attrition statistics. A number of expanded services for which we first planned, then projected into the budget, and finally implemented, are related to utilization of attrition data and are enumerated below. In 2010 NUNM formed an on -campus Counseling Center available without charge to students. Since then, NUNM has annually reviewed these services and expanded budgeting as funding has permitted. In spring 2011 NUNM created the position of associate dean of academic progress, a position dedicated to providing academic counseling and coordinating services for at risk students, oversight of tutoring services, and oversight of the faculty advising system. In 2015 the po sition evolved into the Center for Academic Success under the Office of Student Life that, in addition to the initial services, centralizes academic advising for students of all degree programs and oversees the newly formed Testing Center designed in respo nse to the growing number of students with testing accommodation and other testing needs. Recent activities include development of an academic early alert system and expanded use of Simplicity/Advocate Software, which is already used by the institution for tracking incident reports and student requests for services. The Center continues to work toward improvements to the faculty advising system, supports the program deans on continuing to improve faculty training in strategies to better serve student learni ng outcomes, and development of a learning strategies and tips guide for students to be easily accessible from the NUNM website. In 2011 a career services position was appointed to support students and alumni. In spring 2015 NUNM hired a long -planned -for intercultural engagement and support manager. This position supports student retention and success through advising culturally underrepresented and international students, serves as chair of the AWARE and Allies teams, facilitates trainings and workshops, and provides guidance to university administrators and faculty. In January 2016 we appointed a director of student life and conduct, who oversees the day -to-day operations of the Student Life Office, the student honor code, conduct processes and adjudicati on, conflict resolution, college events, student activities, organizations and programs, and student support services. This position frees the AVP of student affairs/dean of students to provide higher level planning and oversight of this division of the in stitution. Administrative areas were reorganized in 2016 to include an AVP of enrollment management. Faculty are provided with training to effectively teach to a variety of student learning styles. Cultural competency training of faculty and staff further s understanding of cultural issues as they relate to students as well as the unique needs of culturally marginalized patients. NWCCU Year Seven Report 102 2/7/17 Standard Three - Planning and Implementation Cultural competency training now occurs throughout the curricula of our students. Utilization of Indicators of Mission Success from Core Theme Two: Teaching and Learning - Deliver education that ensures student achievement of competencies within the art and science of natural medicine practice and research. From this Core Theme we chose three indicators of mission fulfillment : Pass rates on clinic entrance and exit exams within the medical colleges Pass rates on the licensure boards for students and graduates of the medical colleges Level to which curricula of our degree programs retain the classical roots of their medicines Pass rates on clinical exams Consideration of data from the clinical exams has resulted in a number of changes to curricula as well as changes to the exams themselves. College of Classical Chinese Medicine Clinic Entrance Exam: Review by faculty of the questions frequently missed on the clinic entrance exam. Faculty noted an increase in reliance by students in the clinical experience and classroom on online applications for foundational knowledge such as point location and herbal formulation, rather tha n having this knowledge memorized and internalized. As a result, faculty are reinforcing with students the importance of having foundational knowledge internalized rather than relying on external tools that aren't always available when needed. Institution of annual comprehensive exams to supplement the clinic entrance exam that contain and build on the information included in the previous exams. This change was made as a result of faculty discussion of the entrance exam process and additional data that woul d be helpful in identifying the challenges within course material being experienced by students. Expanding the question bank from which well -vetted questions can be drawn for the clinic entrance exam in any given year. Faculty are encouraged to have stude nts write and answer test questions as part of their coursework that can contribute to this question bank while promoting critical thinking and clinical reasoning. Including the pass rate on the existing Point Location portion of the Clinic Entrance Exam ination as part of the indicator for achievement of the clinic entrance and exit exam objective. This strengthens our assessment of whether students are achieving the minimum competency standards to enter the internship phase of their clinical training. Improve the clinic entrance exam process by including a practical portion that uses a level - appropriate version of the grading rubric used in the clinic exit examination. This same rubric will be used in the Clinical Case Presentation I -III series of cours es, to provide students with a strong framework of the knowledge, skills and attitudes they need in the clinic. College of Classical Chinese Medicine Clinic Exit Exam Expand the exit exam process to include an OSCE -type process similar to the one curren tly used in the naturopathic program discussed below. To expand the data on student understanding reflected in the clinic exit exam, a minimum of two cases used in the Clinical Case Presentation series will consider conditions for which the family history is highly significant. Faculty are now receiving training in writing case reports. NWCCU Year Seven Report 103 2/7/17 Standard Three - Planning and Implementation Student requirements now include creation of meaningful patient timelines in years one and two of their program and development of quality case reports in the final two ye ars of their program. Recommendation: For the School of Classical Chinese Medicine, it is recommended that, in the next accreditation cycle, we add an additional program level indicator of mission fulfillment: the creation of a publication -quality case report by each graduating student. College of Naturopathic Medicine Clinical Exams This college utilizes Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs), milestone exams held three times throughout the students' medical education at NUNM: an entrance exam, a progression exam, and an exit exam. Following are examples of utilization of data in support of mission fulfillment to make changes. The structure of the exit exam was similar to the entrance and progression exams until 2013, when the exit exam became a multi -station exam evaluating student skills in a variety of shorter patient scenarios. The exam format was revised in order to align t he NUNM exit exam with the best practices of the majority of academic medical institutions as well as to ensure that we were assessing student performance in a variety of health conditions and situations, versus evaluating them based on a single patient sc enario. An open book written exam was added to further evaluate students' abilities to use resources to answer questions about possible diagnoses, laboratory evaluation, and conventional and natural treatment options. Each year, the individual parts of each OSCE exam are analyzed and areas of weakness and strength are identified. Faculty are informed annually of specific strengths and weaknesses in student performance for the purpose of making curriculum adjustments. The re -conceptualized ND curriculum, which is in its second year of roll out of the four year program, utilized the strengths and weaknesses of students as reflected in the three OSCE exams as it reconstructed the ND curriculum. Clinical competencies developed by a subcommittee of the AANMC, an association of all accredited ND programs, which was chaired by our own ND dean, was a source of external data utilized to inform the reconstruction of our ND clinical competencies, the measurement of which is reflected throughout the OSCE exams. First time pass rates for graduates of the first professional degree programs in each category of the national licensure exams. College of Classical Chinese Medicine Licensure Exams An area of weakness identified in the licensure pass rates of our students and graduates is in recent results for the Chinese Herbal Exam (CHE). In 2014, CCM students ' pass rate on this exam dipped substantially below the national average and was the lowest recorded for CCM students. NUNM 's program provides excellent training i n a classical approach to herbal formulation and prescription. While students learn about contemporary approaches to herbal formulation, including TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine), this is not the focus of training. However, the national exams are writte n from a TCM perspective. A review of faculty who taught the major herbs courses for the students taking the 2014 CHE revealed that the change in pass rate corresponded with a change in the faculty member teaching the first year Herbs I -III series. This fa culty member has a highly classical approach to teaching single herbs. Although his courses are rigorous, and achieve excellent evaluations from students, it is clear that the content of his courses needs to be expanded to provide students with the foundat ion needed to pass the CHE. For very pragmatic reasons, NUNM students need to be able to pass the CHE, even if it means taking the time to learn herbs in a manner that may be divergent from the classical mission of their program. As a result of this review of licensure exam scores, extra care has now been taken to ensure that students are receiving adequate training in the modern NWCCU Year Seven Report 104 2/7/17 Standard Three - Planning and Implementation classification of single herbs and herbal formulation in all of their foundational herbs classes. In addition, the Herb Board Rev iew course, which is supportive of students preparing for their herbal licensure exams, has been reframed to ensure that the course competency of being confident and well -prepared to take the CHE and the similar exam specific to the State of California is being achieved. College of Naturopathic Medicine Licensure Exams There was a clear dip in pass rates for the basic science boards during August of 2014, with our pass rate lower than the national mean. A review indicated that concurrently we had a signif icant change in our anatomy faculty, which meant that analysis of teaching methodology and course exams scores were not readily available. In response to this identified weakness, in summer 2015 we supplemented the education already received by students b y contracting with faculty to develop and teach a free -to-students basic science review class focused heavily on anatomy. To our knowledge this is the only class of its kind within accredited ND programs. In summer 2016, the review course was expanded fro m 36 hours to approximately 85 hours, and in addition to an expanded anatomy review, it included physiology, microbiology, immunology, and biochemistry. Test results for August 2015 and 2016 were higher than the national mean for all schools. In addition, our curriculum mapping of the ND degree has been expanded to identify where NPLEX board topics appear within the curriculum. Classical Roots of the Medicines The review of data from specifically targeted questions in annual program exit surveys informs our understanding of student perception of the level to which the curricula retain the classical roots of their medicines. For example, the recent curriculum red esign in the ND program was informed by the annual exit survey data, comments analyzed from student satisfaction surveys and focus groups, faculty focus and work groups, and a dedicated curriculum review e -mail address for sharing input. Students begin th eir study of naturopathic history and philosophy in year one with a 24 week course, followed by an in -depth retreat focusing on the medicine's roots in spring term. New to the revised curriculum is additional emphasis on a naturopathic approach to clinical medicine embedded within the Structure and Function course, in the form of case discussions within small -group tutorials. Also new to the revised curriculum are 40 hours of Clinical Observation, after which students write case reports that discuss not o nly the biomedical aspects of the cases, but their reflections on the application of naturopathic principles by the medical team they have observed. Naturopathic medicine's traditional treatment methods are taught in a focused course entitled Introduction to Therapeutic Modalities for 24 weeks in the first year curriculum. Embedded throughout the second and third year block curriculum is over 500 hours of further material focusing on traditional naturopathic approaches to disease and treatment. Additionally , in year two, students are educated in one of the classical naturopathic modalities, Hydrotherapy, as they provide treatment to patients in much the same way that naturopathic physicians were 100+ years ago. In years three and four, students become more c linically -focused, and observe and practice both traditional and modern naturopathic medicine in a true clinical setting. In addition, the ND program offers more than 35 elective courses reflecting elements of classical naturopathic philosophy or therapeut ics. The College of Classical Chinese Medicine received NWCCU approval for its Doctor of Science in Oriental Medicine (DSOM) program in spring 2015. As it is built around the MSOM, the development process for the DSOM included an exploration of whether th e MSOM could be improved/enhanced. Using input and data from multiple sources, including the annual student satisfaction and graduate exit surveys, course evaluations, student focus groups, and meetings between the dean and individual alumni, the CCM facul ty and administration created a revised version of the MSOM. Many of the changes were focused on strengthening achievement of the college's classical mission, including the following examples: 1) the Foundations of CCM three credit course became a six cred it series, in order to expand the base of classical theory in the first year of the program; 2) the Biomedicine series was moved into the second and third years NWCCU Year Seven Report 105 2/7/17 Standard Three - Planning and Implementation (from the first and second), in order to immerse students in the theory and practices of CCM be fore learning how to understand biomedicine from a CCM perspective; 3) a second Chinese Medical Psychology course was added to expand this classical root of curricular content; 4) several course series were reorganized into a new Clinical Medicine series t hat has a clinical theater component and emphasizes classical lineage -style approaches; and 5) a series of Advanced Acu -Moxa Techniques classes was added to deepen student skills in classical acupuncture. In addition, the clinical evaluation tools for the clinical rotations and the clinic exit examination were revised to include level -appropriate sections on classical approaches in clinical practice. ACAOM's standards for the first professional doctoral degree included competencies at the master's level, with additional doctoral -level competencies in the areas of systems -based medicine and professional practice. The MSOM program already met essentially all of these standards, although new courses were created to deepen the level of attainment of ACAOM's doctoral level competencies. However, NUNM's main focus in creating its DSOM has been to achieve a higher level attainment of its own classical mission. The core difference between the MSOM and DSOM programs is a three year, 18 credit series that teaches students how to read classical Chinese, and to translate the classical texts of Chinese medicine directly from the original characters. DSOM students are then supported to apply this knowledge in the clinical setting (as assessed on the aforementioned clinical evaluation tools). Additional courses, such as the CCM Immersion Retreat, Chinese History and Culture II -III, and the Advanced Cosmology and Symboli sm series, were added to strengthen DSOM students' understanding of the historical, cultural and philosophical framework of CCM, and to enhance their ability to apply this knowledge in the clinic for the benefit of patients. The Imaginal and Experiential I nquiries series supports students to choose and refine their Doctoral Capstone topic, and through the Doctoral Capstone Tutorial and Mentorship processes, DSOM students are supported to a three -part, classically -rooted capstone project. MSOM stude nts are able to benefit from the DSOM -specific courses, as long as they have the pre -requisites. For example, many of the MSOM students not taking the full classical texts series of classes still take the Advanced Cosmology and Symbolism series, which prov ides them with a deeper classical understanding of the acupuncture points and channels. An example from our School of Research and Graduate Studies includes additional coursework added to the required curriculum of the MScGH as a result of lower than ant icipated student agreement with one of the indicators identified toward meeting the classical perspective of the program. The classical roots of the medicines we teach are core to our institutional mission. The indirect measures identified for this ac creditation cycle are helpful toward informing mission fulfillment and curricula changes, but more direct measures would strengthen our understanding of this aspect of mission fulfillment. This is explored in Standard Four recommendations. Utilization of Indicators of Mission Success from Core Theme Three: Promote the success of our graduates through our academic, clinical, and research endeavors From Core Theme Three we chose two indicators: data concerning the field in which alumni are employed and alumni perception on how well they were prepared to practice. Indicator : Percentage of alumni who report they are employed in a field directly related to their NUNM degree Indicator: Alumni perception of how well NUNM prepared them for a ca reer in their profession NUNM continues to expand resources in promoting the success of our graduates, taking into consideration placement data of alumni one year after graduation, alumni responses to surveys concerning their area of employment, and alumn i perception of how well NUNM prepared them for a career in their professions. There is limited external data specific to the fields our alumni enter, so placement and wage data is a resource used by stakeholders related to key occupations. Data on use of degree, type of employment, and NWCCU Year Seven Report 106 2/7/17 Standard Three - Planning and Implementation wage is used to help NUNM and affiliated schools understand the alignment of education with industry needs. The NUNM Center for Career Development, which reports to the Enrollment Management division, uses placement and inco me data to analyze and compare with trends that are observed through market research and through support to stakeholders. The Center shares the data with students and alumni who are evaluating whether to add or drop degree programs, considering career goal s, applying to jobs, and negotiating contracts and wages. In addition, employers request information from the Center for Career Development to define job openings and determine wages. This process then informs the planning for the Center for Career Develop ment including career fair vendor invitations, talks, and workshops provided each term. Aside from the career fair, the Center plans and implements the annual TIP TOP conference. The Integrative Practitioner, The Optimal Professional showcases successful p ractitioners describing their jobs and how they prepared for them. The event also highlights successful doctors, acupuncturists, nutritionist, and small business owners discussing how they started and stayed in business. Finally the event is intended to he lp students, alumni, and others build knowledge and materials to succeed in their career. Processes in support of the ND Community Experience (ComEx) Preceptorship (formerly known as ND Field Observation) requirement have been finely tuned in AYs 15 -16 an d 16 -17, including increased participation by community preceptors in evaluation of student learning outcomes for the course, improved opportunities for students to gain real -world clinical experience, and streamlining of documentation processes taking int o consideration preceptor and student input. In addition to broadening and strengthening the clinical skills of our students, ComEx helps to prepare students for a private practice outside of the NUNM Health Center environment and provides the opportunity to explore clinic al areas of special interest. Similarly, the School of Research and Graduate Studies includes internships and fieldwork experiences within the nutrition and global health programs. Examples of improvements based upon student and external faculty input include development of a Global Health Fieldwork Manual, assignment of faculty mentors to assess gaps in students' current skills prior to selection of fieldwork projects and locations, refinement of rubrics for final presentations and report s, and standardization of on -site evaluations for site managers. Alumni employment outcomes inform the focus of the fieldwork, and students are strongly encouraged to ensure their fieldwork aligns with career goals. This process maximizes the ability to pu t foundational knowledge into practical application in a real world setting while building skill sets for resumes and work. NUNM continues to seek and obtain increased funding for residencies for ND and CCM graduates, providing, for the selected graduate, the opportunity to further hone skills and make contacts prior to pursuing their future careers. Both CCM and ND residencies have been effective tools for graduates to apply their degrees to patient care in a clinic setting with increasing autono my and less direct supervision. This environment helps to hone quality of care and confidence in treatment choices, including patient engagement. The well -established ND residency program has provided an excellent model for the leading edge CCM (AOM \u2014acupun cture and oriental medicine) residency program, which was made possible in the 2014 -15 academic year by a generous donation to the university. CCM is working to share its residency model with other AOM schools, and toward the development of residency stand ards recognized by the AOM profession. Finally, our Office of Advancement, Continuing Education and Alumni Affairs takes into consideration alumni survey data as it continues to improve continuing education and other alumni services. CE continues to expan d its remote offerings, an area identified for expansion from alumni surveys. Similarly, we periodically survey alumni for their input on future CE activities and use that input in creation of offerings for coming years. The most recent CE interest survey was conducted in summer 2016 and is guiding the 2017 CE lineup. The alumni section of the NUNM website provides alumni survey data, information concerning services of the Center for Career Development, positions available, and practice locations for rent o r sale. It also helps to maintain connections throughout the NUNM community and engage alumni NWCCU Year Seven Report 107 2/7/17 Standard Three - Planning and Implementation and partners in campus life. Business, direct consumer, and alumni demand is considered in the development of the website and CE offerings to ensure both current and emerging workforce development needs are met. In summary, the Core Themes chosen by NUNM (Student Success, Teaching and Learning , and Professional Vitality ) were identified because they flow naturally from the mission of the institution and are repre sentative of major ways in which we work toward mission fulfillment. Departmental plans are tied to the three themes through the institution's strategic planning database . Each of the objectives is aligned with and contributes to accomplishment of the Core Themes. The indicators chosen for objectives are measurable and afford useful evidence toward our level of achievement of outcomes. Several indicators have been identifi ed for improvement in the next Seven Year cycle and are delineated in the Recommendations document and discussed in appendix 0.1, in this standard, and in Standard Four. NWCCU Year Seven Report 108 2/7/17 Standard Four - Effectiveness and Improvement STANDARD FOUR - EFFECTIVENESS & IMPROVEMENT This Standard is organized into two major sections. Section One addresses the manner in which NUNM regularly and systematically collects data to evaluate achievement of its institutional and program goals and outcomes, its systems for assessment of student achievement, the integration of planning and assessment efforts, communication of data resulting from assessments to our community (including core theme achievement), and u tilization of assessment of student learning to inform planning efforts. Section One also provides a description of methods used to make the results of assessment efforts available to appropriate constituencies in a timely manner, including data for indic ators of Core Themes. Section Two focuses on the utilization of data toward understanding our success in meeting our Core Themes and objectives and improvements generated as a result of utilization of this data. SECTION ONE - ASSESSMENT - 4.A Policies and procedures to guide NUNM's assessment processes were approved in October 2004 with revisions in 2005, 2009, and 2017. The Institutional Assessment Policy and accompanying procedures is provided in appendix 4.1. This policy outlines NUNM's ass essment processes, including determination of mission fulfillment, and participants in the Institutional Assessment Committee. Further revisions are anticipated within the next few months. (4.A.5, 4.B.2, 5.A.1, 5.A.2, 5.B.2) Initially the milestones of the assessment plan were tracked in word documents by Institutional Research and Assessment (now Institutional Research and Compliance). The NUNM strategic and assessment plans are now tracked by the Office of Institutional Res earch and Compliance (IRC) utilizing the Strategic Planning Online Database (SPOL). This software allows tracking of department goals to applicable Key Progress Indicators from the Framework for Action and to Core Themes. Assessment measures for success in meeting goals are also tracked through the software. Reports and exhibits can be generated on campus from SPOL reflecting the milestones tracked through the assessment plan. (4.A.1) The IRC guides departments in selecting methods of assessment using a mix of direct and indirect measures. In addition, the department guides deans and chairs as needed in development of formative and summative assessment measures of student success and supports leadership in tracking programmatic success. The results of assessment efforts of Core Theme, programs, and services are communicated to the NUNM community in a variety of manners, and data is utilized toward implementing improvements. Below are examples of sharing of data and some of the changes that have been initiated. When the communication is applicable to objectives and indicators of core themes, this is noted in the bulleted references below. (4.B.1) As part of an NIH (National Institutes of Health) funded research education initiative, NUNM developed E vidence Based Medicine (EBM) competencies and curriculum. In addition, NUNM shared this information with the broader natural medicine community, including publishing manuscripts that detailed activities that could be undertaken at other institutions, holdi ng conferences with trainings on EBM, and offering EBM workshops on the campuses of four other universities. Upon completion of analysis of data, the IRC distributes to individual departments tables summarizing data from student satisfaction (Core Theme O ne) and graduating student exit surveys and comments (Core Themes One and Two) applicable to the department. Department heads review the comments concerning their staff or processes and share this input in ongoing and annual employee evaluations. Comment s regarding curricula, faculty, or staff are reviewed by deans (Core Theme Two). Input from these assessment measures were incorporated into the recent ND and MSOM revisions, development of the DSOM, and revisions to curricula within the School of Graduate Studies. NWCCU Year Seven Report 109 2/7/17 Standard Four - Effectiveness and Improvement The IRC maintains a page on Moodle, the learning platform currently used by NUNM. On this are posted survey results such as student satisfaction (Core Theme One) and exit surveys (Core Theme Two), meeting minutes, licensure exam results (Core Th eme Two), and academic reports to the Board of Directors. The page is updated when assessed data becomes available and is open to all students and employees and facilitates community understanding of opinions, awareness of external assessment results, and institutional processes. Alumni success data (Core Theme Three) is disseminated on the NUNM website after data analysis is completed and includes results of alumni surveys. Income and employment results of the 2014 alumni survey are in the alumni section of the NUNM website. Results of prior annual income surveys (1999, 2004, and 2010) were similarly posted on the website. The career services manager, who oversees the NUNM Center for Career Development, captures and maintains one year after graduation c areer data including hourly salary for NUNM graduates and uses this data to advise potential and current students as well as external organizations (Core Themes One and Three). In addition to sharing this data with students and graduates who are utilizing the services of the Center, this data is also shared with the Academic Affairs Committee of the board at quarterly meetings. Potential students are referred to the NUNM alumni survey results online and work with the NUNM Center for Career Development fo r understanding salary and career data (Core Themes One and Three). Utilizing a literature review and identification of strengths valued by NUNM within our faculty, an administrative team including all program deans developed faculty competencies and broug ht the competencies to faculty meetings and the Faculty Senate for discussion prior to adoption. These are posted on the Center for Teaching and Learning webpage designed for faculty - http://cae.nunm. edu/faculty -outcomes/ (Core Theme Two). Faculty and deans review data on the clinic entrance and exit exams (Core Theme Two) during faculty meetings and retreats. Examples of application of this data are examination by faculty within the College of Classic al Chinese Medicine of frequently missed test questions and faculty observation that students increasingly rely on external tools such as online applications. Faculty now reinforce with students the importance of having foundational knowledge memorized rat her than relying on resources that aren't always available when needed. Faculty identified additional data that would be helpful in understanding challenges experienced by students within course material, and annual comprehensive exams are being developed that contain and build on the information included in previous exams. Similarly, in the ND program annually the individual parts of each OSCE exam are analyzed and areas of weakness and strength are identified. Faculty are informed of specific strengths a nd weaknesses in student cohort performance for the purpose of making curriculum adjustments. The re -conceptualized ND curriculum, which is in its second year of roll out of the four year program, utilized understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of students as reflected in the three OSCE exams as it reconstructed the ND curriculum. The recent curriculum redesign in the ND program was also informed by the annual exit survey data, comments analyzed from student satisfaction surveys, a dedicated e -mail a ddress for sharing input, and focus groups of students and faculty. Within the School of Research and Graduate Studies, review of input from students as well as field faculty on internships and fieldwork experiences led to changes within the nutrition and global health programs, including development of a Global Health Fieldwork Manual, assignment of faculty mentors to assess gaps in students' current skills prior to selection of fieldwork projects and locations, refinement of rubrics for final presentation s and reports, and standardized on -site evaluations for site managers. NWCCU Year Seven Report 110 2/7/17 Standard Four - Effectiveness and Improvement Survey results related to curriculum, such as graduating student exit surveys (Core Themes One and Two) are discussed annually at meetings of the Program and Curriculum Review Committee , which includes student and faculty representatives from each NUNM School or College. This data provides guidance to the PCRC in its discussions of curriculum revisions. Continuing education needs of alumni as identified through surveys are used in the development of offerings for future years (Core Theme Three). The Office of Admissions, on a monthly basis, provides projected head count data by program for the next ad missions cycle to the members of the Enrollment Management Team and all department heads. This data is also provided to the board at their fall, winter, and spring meetings. Data is tracked by the registrar and student life of the progress of continuing st udents by year and by program. The data from these sources is used in departmental and institutional planning efforts including human resources needs such as staff and faculty; facilities such as office space, study space, classrooms, and teaching equipme nt; and budget planning for the current and future years including projections of income and expense. Each department is responsible for designing departmental goals, including measurable assessments. The goals, assessment measures, targets, and results ar e posted to the SPOL database. SPOL users can link goals and assessment measures to Key Progress Indicators and Core Themes (Core Themes One, Two and Three). SPOL is updated on an ongoing basis by unit heads and annually is reviewed by the IRC for complet eness. The data base is shared on the internal accreditation server with employees who oversee a planning unit. Annual employee evaluations include progress toward achievement of goals for the prior year, planned goals for the coming year, and plans of action and supports toward addressing areas for further skill development and achievement of career goals. Evaluations of some staff and administrators includes input collected by the supervisor from direct reports and peers. Compiled input that maintains anonymity of the contributor is shared with the individual employee. Annual evaluations for non -faculty employees occur in November of each year. Results of student, faculty, and staff cultural climate surveys (Core Theme One) are discussed in community hour presentations and meetings of AWARE, Allies, SGA, and faculty, including generation of ideas for improvements in the campus climate. Overseen by IRC, institutional data is shared through the NUNM Factbook, which is provided on the NUNM website. The Fa ctbook includes student demographics, enrollment data, alumni data (Core Theme Three), graduation statistics (Core Theme One), institutional demographics, financial data, and library statistics. The Factbook is updated annually in late fall. Information Specific to Schools and Colleges Detailed below is a discussion for each School or College. School of Research and Graduate Studies Multiple forms of feedback and evaluation have been the basis for ongoing formative assessment in the implementation of new master's programs within the School of Research and Graduate Studies. Because many of our master's programs are new, we've not yet had the opportunity to evaluate the results of programmatic changes. However, these assessments are occurring regularly, and as changes happen they detect gaps and provide a mechanism for making improvements. In addition to using course evaluations and the institutional student satisfaction surveys as forms of assessment, the following methods have been used: Interviews Focus g roups NWCCU Year Seven Report 111 2/7/17 Standard Four - Effectiveness and Improvement Satisfaction data and comments from course evaluations Annual student satisfaction survey data (an indicator for Core Theme One) Annual exit surveys of graduating students (an indicator for Core Theme Two) Evaluations of students from faculty and site supervisors (fieldwork and nutrition internship sites) Monthly feedback from NUNM's Student Government Association (SGA) Master of Science in Integrative Medicine Research (MSiMR) In evaluating the MSiMR program, administrators examined the career op portunities available to graduates and redesigned the program structure, courses, and course material based on this information. The assessment used to obtain this information included individual interviews with graduates (Core Theme Three), future employe rs, and information gathered from potential employers of graduates. Specifically, the Research Methodology course was updated to include a broader range of study designs and research skills. This modification increases the breadth of studies that student s can perform for their Masters projects, and further develops their knowledge set for future careers. The Technical Writing course was moved to earlier in the program so that students can take it prior to the Grantwriting course. Both technical writing an d grantwriting skills make students more competitive for admission to PhD programs, and make them desirable candidates for research positions. Individual development plans (IDPs) were added to the curriculum of the Integrative Research Fundamentals I -III courses. IDPs are now a requirement at NIH for all trainees, and the addition of this component to our research program further prepares our students for the next step of their career. Students who have completed the revised curriculum have felt better pre pared for PhD applications and research fellowships. Three students have applied for PhDs in the past year, as opposed to one in the previous three years. (As of January 2017 the status of the applications is not yet determined.) These changes to the MSiMR program meet several program outcomes including: Describe and apply all aspects of study design, including articulating appropriate questions, generating hypotheses, choosing appropriate design and methods, selecting outcomes, designing data manageme nt and analytic strategies. Effectively present data in written, oral, and poster format for varied audiences. Practice the conscientious application of various research methods to the study of integrative medicine systems and modalities. Articulate an are a of research emphasis and communicate short - and long -term career goals. Master of Science in Integrative Mental Health (MSiMH) Feedback from students in the ND and other graduate programs indicated that many wanted access to the material being presented in the mental health program, but didn't necessarily want to complete a second degree program. The assessment used to obtain this information was from monthly NUNM Student Government Association (SGA) meetings and was presented to the program chair. The c hair also surveyed the mental health students to determine their specific interests for elective course topics. Using these assessments, the chair then worked with the mental health faculty to develop elective courses that would be appropriate for both men tal health students, and those in other NUNM programs who hadn't been exposed to the foundational information presented in the formalized mental health program. Current and upcoming elective courses include: Introduction to Addictions, Psychology of Yoga, Nature -Based Counseling, Mindfulness -Based Bodywork, and Attachment Work. The mental health elective courses that have been taught to date have received positive course evaluations from students. This process has illuminated an NWCCU Year Seven Report 112 2/7/17 Standard Four - Effectiveness and Improvement institutional process barri er. Timing is the main challenge when developing new courses in response to student feedback, as the timeframe from receiving student feedback to implementation of a new course is a minimum of six to nine months. The changes to the MSiMH program describe d above increase the number of students who are trained to meet the program outcome to \"compare and contrast a variety of psychotherapeutic theories and approaches to change.\" Master of Science in Nutrition (MScN) The MScN program was originally designed for students who intended to pursue careers in clinical nutrition. Assessment of students' career interests over the first two years of the program indicated that they were interested in nutrition -related career paths beyond clinical nutrition. The assessm ent used to obtain this information was through review of course evaluations and student comments to both nutrition mentors and the nutrition internship coordinator. Mentors meet with the program chair monthly, and the nutrition internship coordinator meet s with the chair weekly. In combination with the course evaluations, this feedback was used to design a plan to address student concerns and interests. Course evaluations for the Food Policy and Public Health and Community Nutrition courses demonstrated students' interest in careers related to community nutrition. The Global and Ecological Food Issues course evaluations showed students' interest in the emerging field of environmental nutrition. Evaluations from the Recipe and Menu Development course showed students' interest in careers as personal chefs or related culinary careers. As a result, four distinct elective \"tracks\" have been developed that include specific electives focused on these four types of careers: clinical, culinary, community, and enviro nmental nutrition. The nutrition elective tracks are in the process of being implemented. We expect that steering students towards electives that are matched to their career interests will conserve student resources by directing them to career paths, all ow us to fill courses more completely, and allow us to discontinue elective courses that don't match tracks and student interests. Assessment after graduation will provide data on the effectiveness of these tracks in preparing students for their projected careers. The change to include tracks in the nutrition program meets the nutrition program outcome of developing skills expertise, specifically that students will be able to develop necessary tools to effectively apply nutrition knowledge in clinical, ed ucational, and culinary settings. Master of Science in Global Health (MScGH) The Global Health Practicum course was originally designed to prepare students for their fieldwork experience through background research on organizations, literature searches, a nd discussion of potential projects with their mentors. Feedback from the fieldwork site supervisors, students who completed fieldwork, and mentors indicated that students needed more practical experience before beginning fieldwork. Data for this assessmen t was collected on a post -fieldwork feedback form completed by site supervisors and during individual interviews with students. As a result of this feedback, the first quarter of Global Health Practicum was revised so that students work with an organizatio n on an actual project. This provides practical experience for students to build upon when developing their own individual fieldwork project. In order to conserve student and institutional resources, we decided to modify the existing curriculum rather than developing an additional course. This is the first year that the change in the Global Health Practicum has been implemented. New data will be available in spring 2017 when students return from their fieldwork experiences. The change to the Global Health Practicum course strengthens students' abilities to meet the global health program outcome that graduates will be able to \"participate in the design, implementation and evaluation of global health programs.\" NWCCU Year Seven Report 113 2/7/17 Standard Four - Effectiveness and Improvement College of Naturopathic Medicine The evaluation process for students and the ND program itself includes a variety of formative and summative tools utilized to gauge the effectiveness of student learning and of the program as a whole. The ND Program Assessment Plan (available on site) illustrates the ND program plan for assessment of student and program outcomes. Evaluation tools range from classroom assessments and exams to clinic evaluation forms for individual clinic shifts. Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCE) (an indicator for Core Th eme Two) and NPLEX board exams (and indicator for Core Theme Two) provide a more global perspective and occur at major milestone points in their education. Feedback from student evaluations of individual courses and instructors is used to make improvement s to courses and to provide data for the faculty evaluation process. The ND program curriculum map allows us to identify where in the program we are meeting the program -level outcomes. The satisfactory academic progress (SAP) policy, academic contracts, and our newly purchased academic early alert system utilizing Simplicity/Advocate software (Core Theme One) are used to monitor students who are not doing well in the program and to track their academic progress. In addition, student exit surveys (Core Th eme One), conducted every spring since 2002, allow administrators to obtain student perceptions about the adequacy of their education as the students near graduation. The responsibility of student evaluation falls first on individual instructors for class room and clinic experiences. More globally, the dean of the program is responsible for ensuring the success of our students and our graduates. In addition, student attrition is tracked by cohort (by year of matriculation) (Core Theme One) and a quarterly basis (as a snapshot in time). Students are also surveyed annually for their satisfaction with the student services on campus such as the NUNM store, library, financial aid, registration, counseling, etc. (Core Theme One). One year post graduation placeme nt data and hourly income is maintained by the NUNM Center for Career Development and used to advise students and alumni in their career choices (Core Themes One and Three). Finally, alumni are surveyed approximately every three years to capture annual income data, assess graduate employment trends, continued education needs, satisfaction with their educational experience at NUNM, and other data points. In addition to supporting alumni success, alumni success data is also used toward guiding potential and current students on their career goals (Core Themes One and Three). The following section is a summary of our evaluation tools to measure student and program outcomes. Each of these evaluation pieces plays a crucial role in institutional planning proces ses. Policies regarding evaluations relevant to current students are outlined in the student handbook (enclosed separately), which also contains the policies for clinic and preceptorship. Academic Assessment Students are evaluated early in their academic career with classroom assessment tools such as exams, quizzes, projects, and presentations in both their didactic and lab courses. Faculty are required to identify assessment dates and clearly state requiremen ts for passing courses on their syllabus, the template of which was created by the Program and Curriculum Review Committee and most recently updated in 2015. In addition, with the launch of the 2015 curriculum revision, the new syllabus template expects fa culty to identify which program outcomes, competencies and sub -competencies are covered in a course. Assessment results are used to give feedback to students on their performance in the class and their ability to meet the course outcomes. Faculty are expec ted to clearly identify outcomes that specifically outline the knowledge, skills, and abilities that a student is expected to achieve by the completion of the course. Within the redesigned ND curriculum, courses are now graded on an A -F system, as oppose d to the prior Honors/Pass/Fail system. By having courses on a graded system, advisors are now better able to differentiate levels of student success. NWCCU Year Seven Report 114 2/7/17 Standard Four - Effectiveness and Improvement Clinical Assessment Beyond academic coursework, evaluation of a student's clinical skills is an essential component of the assessment plan. We have made several changes to our clinical grading process over the last two years, and we are systematically incorporating these changes into the program. This year we revised the clinical proficiency objectiv es that students must meet in order to graduate. The new requirements step away from what was previously a list of exams to be completed and therapeutics to be prescribed. The new objectives focus on what students need to accomplish to be proficient primar y care physicians and meet the competency requirements for graduation, including taking focused histories and performing physical exams in all types of conditions, the ability to differentially diagnose and justify their assessments, appropriate evaluation of conditions using diagnostic means, management of acute and chronic conditions utilizing the full scope of therapies, and determination of appropriate preventive exams with provision of anticipatory guidance for all ages and gender groups. We have also instituted a new method of formative clinical assessment. The mini clinical evaluation exercise (mini -CEX) is being piloted this year as a means to provide students with additional feedback in regards to their clinical skills. In the mini -CEX, the evaluat or observes an entire student -patient encounter in the clinic setting, including the consult with the attending physician, and provision of diagnosis and treatment to the patient. A standardized evaluation form is completed and both written and verbal feed back provided to the student. Initially, we are piloting this project with students who have either failed previous clinic rotations or have been recommended to remediate by a faculty member, as well as with randomly selected students. Clinical Rotation E valuation Tools Clinical rotations are the culmination of the ND education, and as such, we've worked to develop a robust assessment tool. In spring 2013, the ND program created a new clinical evaluation form (available on site). The previous evaluation to ol provided minimal guidance on areas of students' strengths and weaknesses. The form had no concrete numerical Pass/Fail standard, and faculty often noted the document was too vague to help them identify students who were marginal. The new forms provide d etailed competencies for evaluating students. Each competency is assigned a number of points in relation to its importance as a skill set, and students are graded on a 1 -5 scale for each competency. The form automatically weighs the competency points with the student's performance score, allowing an objective tool for supervising physicians to utilize when grading students. The explicit nature of the competencies also allows for structured and more specific feedback from clinical faculty to students. After utilizing these new forms, the faculty voted to use a numerical score cut -off for Pass/Fail grades, which will further standardize evaluation of students across clinical shifts. The evaluation form for the last year of study, when the student has primar y status, and, under a faculty supervisor, is responsible for the patient visit, is weighted by the following sections: Patient Care (includes initiative and responsibility, interviewing skills, communication skills and rapport with patient & history taking) = 25% Skills (includes physical exam & patient reporting /charting techniques) = 25% Knowledge (includes differential diagnosis and assessment skills, application of academic learning to clinical training, and patient care & knowledge of naturopathi c therapies and their proper application) = 25% Practice Management (includes care management & time management skills) = 15% Professional Attributes (includes cooperation with clinical staff, communication skills with peers and supervising physicians and ethical behavior) = 10% NWCCU Year Seven Report 115 2/7/17 Standard Four - Effectiveness and Improvement Evaluation of student skill achievement on Clinic Rotations is on a Likert 1 -5 scale. An Excel evaluation form automatically tallies the weighted scores for each section. Students scoring lower than a mean of three automatically fail the shift and are referred for a six week skills -building course. If a student scores a mean of three or higher, the student passes the rotation, but the clinical supervisor may still recommend or require that the student participate in a six week ski lls building course addressing deficiencies in skill sets. The remedial course is taught by second and/or third year residents. The resident skills handbook (available on site) outlines the process followed by residents and provides guidance on assessment, documentation, and grading of the course. Throughout the creation of this evaluation tool, input was sought from clinical faculty members. Student evaluation was discussed at length during faculty meetings, and many faculty received individual guidance from both the dean and associate dean of naturopathic medicine regarding use of the new grading tool. Despite the template calculating scores if filled out electronically, many faculty members are still printing the document and filling it out manually. Th is is a hindrance in gathering accurate data regarding student scoring. Some faculty report that the length of the form is concerning, yet they still note an appreciation for being able to more accurately grade a variety of student skills. A suggestion was recently made to move this to a paperless process, with the students signing a single form acknowledging receipt of the evaluation during the in -person review process. The administration will continue to evaluate the best way to optimize the use of this n ew form. Curriculum Map There are multiple curriculum maps available for the ND program, including one for tracking NPLEX Basic Science topics, one for Clinical Sciences, one for HIV hours, and of course, one for tracking the program outcomes and competencies Licensure examinat ions The Naturopathic Physicians Licensing Examination (NPLEX) continues to be an important external measure of quality for the naturopathic program. The focus of the clinical examinations is on the ability of graduates to practice medicine safely. The b lueprints for these examinations are based on practice analyses, which reflect how naturopathic medicine is being practiced by physicians around the country. The overall pass rates for NUNM continue to be comparable to the national average and easily su rpass the 70% or higher mandated by CNME; however, the winter test administration pass rate is consistently weaker than the summer exams. Nationally, these tests often show lower passing rates. Our records indicate that exam -takers in winter are often stud ents who have elected to defer the exams after their second year, or who deferred them as a result of failing a course required for eligibility, thus delaying their ability to take the biomedical sciences exam for a full year after completion of biomedical coursework. Students taking the biomedical science exams in winter could also be hindered in focusing on board exam preparation because they are concurrently in classes. Comparability of pass rates for NUNM students and the national average for all stude nts taking the clinical boards in the winter suggests that this issue is not specific to NUNM or its students. Regardless, most of the students who take the winter exams are students who are somehow off track in their education, and most have taken longer to complete their education than four years. Additionally, in some years the number taking the exam in winter is low enough to be of questionable statistical significance when compared to the number of students taking the summer exams. NUNM offers board review classes to students in early summer, and students who are taking exams in winter may not have taken these classes the previous summer, thereby having less focused external preparation. The table below provides an overview for NUNM as well as nationa lly from February 2012 to August 2016 of NPLEX pass rates for individuals taking t he exams for the first time.

Rather, this sect ion describes the CCM - specific planning and procedures. All CCM faculty are supported by the dean and associate dean of academics to evaluate the success of each of their courses, including clinic rotations. The dean and associate deans read the student course and clinic rotation evaluations at each quarter's end. The associate dean of academics regularly attends classes and meets with individual faculty to help them achieve their teaching goals in an effective learner -centered manner. Classroom observat ion notes and recommendations are tracked, as are resulting changes made by faculty. For example, the associate dean is working with the faculty member teaching two first year DSOM courses with which students are struggling (as reported to the dean by indi vidual students, as well as in a \"check -in\" with the first year class). As a result of the feedback, this faculty member is being supported to accomplish rubric -building, enhanced lesson planning, and the creation of flip -class video offerings. Future course evaluations, student \"check -ins\", and faculty feedback are used to gauge the degree of success. Support for clinical teaching is provided primarily by the associate dean of clinical education, and in the framework of the monthly clinical faculty meeting s. The latter can take a variety of forms, including faculty discussions on topics of mutual interest/concern, faculty presentations on their lineage style of teaching/practicing, and trainings by the dean of clinics (\"Managing Student's Education in the C linic\"), associate dean of clinical education (\"Review of Clinical Rotation Evaluation Methods and Tools\"), a faculty member (\"CNT Update\"), or an outside trainer (e.g. \"Recognizing and Managing Addictions in the Clinical Setting\"). Faculty meetings, and in some cases, subcommittee work, are used to increase faculty familiarity with the flow of the entire curriculum, and promote well -conceived integration of courses/clinic rotations into the overall student learning experience. For e xample, in a spring 2014 site visit, representatives of the California Acupuncture Board recommended that the MSOM program provide increased training in orthopedic testing. Members of the acupuncture subcommittee identified courses in each year of the curriculum that can cover the enhanced content; their recommendations were agreed upon by the full -time faculty in a subsequent faculty meeting. As the ultimate goal of the training is to increase utilization of orthopedic knowledge and skills in the clinic, a ll of the clinical faculty are receiving orthopedic training by an NUNM faculty member who is a chiropractor and leads the physical medicine portion of the ND curriculum. Faculty have had a highly positive response to the training and expressed appreciatio n for the opportunity for inter -professional interaction. Training of all clinical faculty is a necessary step to ensure that what students are learning in the classroom is reinforced in their clinical training. Full-time faculty undergo a formal evaluat ion every year by the dean and associate deans, and adjunct faculty every other year. These meetings serve as a further opportunity to review faculty teaching goals and to garner individual perspectives on the strengths and challenges of the academic and c linical aspects of the overall program. It was largely from such meetings that a need to review the continuity of the herbs curriculum was identified and a formal plan initiated. The program learning outcomes for the CCM program are linked with specific content area competencies, which are in turn aligned with the individual course competencies. The content area competencies are mapped to the CCM courses and program level assessments, including a designation of the level (entry, intermediate, advanced) a nd type (written exam/quiz, oral exam, paper/journal, project/presentation, practical exam, and clinical performance). The CCM assessment plan for the program learning outcomes summarizes the program level assessments, including the types of tools used, th e type of assessment NWCCU Year Seven Report 118 2/7/17 Standard Four - Effectiveness and Improvement accomplished by each tool, the person responsible for implementation/grading of the tool, when it is administered, and when the results are reviewed to determine any necessary actions based on the findings. Summer faculty retreats hav e happened most years in the past, but as of 2015 have been formalized into annual \"Closing the Loop\" retreats serving as the venue for evaluating the following: 1) satisfactory achievement of the program goals and program learning outcomes, 2) the effecti veness of the processes by which the goals and learning outcomes are being met, and 3) other elements of program success (both internally and externally focused). Information considered at the retreats can include the following: 1) the results of all of th e evaluation tools for the program learning outcomes (e.g. pass rates on the clinic exit examination, an indicator for Core Theme Two; and the quality of the community education projects); 2) the dean's summarized feedback from the Student Satisfaction Sur vey (Core Theme One), the Graduate Exit Survey (an indicator of classical roots for Core Theme Two), and Alumni Survey, if applicable, an indicator for Core Theme Three; 3) synthesized annual review by the Imaginal and Experiential Inquiries faculty (DSOM -specific); 4) pass rates from t he national NCCAOM examinations (see table on the page 119); and 5) any additional information that is relevant and available (e.g. faculty subcommittee work, information from student/patient/public focus groups, input from t he president/board of directors). The aim is to provide summarized and synthesized analysis to faculty, to be added to faculty perspectives on perceived need for any program refinements and revisions. Implementation plans are created with milestones and ti melines. Examples of changes that might be made include the following: existing courses may be modified (hours, position in the overall curriculum layout, content, format), new courses may be developed and assigned an appropriate place in the curriculum, p lans to improve integration/continuity between courses may be created, evaluation methods may be developed/modified, and support structures may be identified. Plans for specific instructional design/faculty development trainings may also be initiated. Any plans made in the monthly CCM faculty meetings and/or at the summer retreat are carried out in accordance with the appropriate institutional policies and processes, and are incorporated into the CCM strategic plan, which is aligned with the larger strate gic planning process of the university. In the 2014 -15 academic year, the faculty and dean decided to incorporate case report training throughout the CCM programs. They are working with David Riley, MD, Editor -in-Chief, Global Advances in Health and Medici ne, and lead developer of the CAse REport (CARE) Guidelines, used by numerous medical journals to improve the completeness and transparency of published case reports. The CARE development team proposed that \"the systematic aggregation of information from c ase reports will inform clinical study design, provide early signals of effectiveness and harms, and improve healthcare delivery .\" The addition of case report training to the curriculum aligns with all three Core Themes, and with the university Key Progres s Indicator of \"Sustain Excellence in Classroom and Clinical Education\". Once the full training is implemented, students will produce a publication -quality case report on one of their internship patients. This will provide a new program level assessment of multiple program learning outcomes for both the MSOM and DSOM. Accordingly, the CCM strategic plan contains the following two program goals: 1) Incorporate case report training as a longitudinal thread throughout the MSOM/DSOM curricula, and 2) Train all full-time clinical faculty members in the creation of publication -quality case reports using the CARE Guidelines. Under the latter goal is the following milestone: \"Identify a half -time associate dean of clinical education who is a licensed acupuncturist a nd has strong research skills, with hire date in early 2016.\" This was accomplished with the hire of Andrew McIntyre in fall 2016, and is an example of how the strategic planning process guides the allocation of university resources.

SECTION TWO - IMPROVEMENT - 4.B CHANGES MADE AS A RES ULT OF UTILIZATION O F CORE THEME DATA A newer data assessment resource for NUNM is indicator data captured toward un derstanding level of achievement of objectives and Core Themes. This data has afforded usable evidence that has been operationalized by the institution. The data captured for each indicator as well as changes made as a result of utilization of this data i s discussed throughout Core Theme Achievement Narrative ( appendix 0.1) as well as in Standard Three. Below are highlights of changes made in response to data analyzed toward fulfillment of each of the core themes. Core Theme One: Support Student Success The two indicators for objective 2 of Core Theme One, student satisfaction and attrition data, combined with analysis of patterns of comments from surveys and reasons for separation from the institution, have provided guidance to the institution in prioritizing expanded services in support of students for which we first planned, then projected into the budget, and finally implemented. These support services are delineated in Standard 3 under \"Utilization of Mission Fulfillment Data from Indicators for Core Themes\". Core Theme Two: Teaching and Learning - Deliver education that ensures student achievement of competencies within the art and science of natural medicine practice and research Utilization of indicator data for objective 2, A and B, has led to changes within the curricula of the medical programs responding to data from clinic entrance and exit exams and pass rates on external licensure exams. We have also initiated changes to the entrance and exit exams themselves as a result of this ana lysis. See discussions in Standard Three under Core Theme Two, \"Pass rates on clinical exams\", and Core Theme Two, \" First time pass rates for graduates of the first professional degree programs in each category of the national licensure exams.\" NWCCU Year Seven Report 120 2/7/17 Standard Four - Effectiveness and Improvement Utiliz ation of indicator data for objective 3, ensure the curricula retain the classical roots of their medicine, has led to refinements within existing programs as well as the re -conceptualized ND curriculum launched in fall 2015 and the development of the DSOM program, discussed under Standard 3, Core Theme Two, \"Classical Roots of the Medicines\". Core Theme Three: Promote the success of our graduates through our academic, clinical, and research endeavors As regards objective 1, we use one year after graduat ion placement and income data in providing career guidance to current and potential students as well as alumni. To date, we have tracked this data by hand. With the ever increasing number of students within each graduating class, the tracking process has become increasingly time consuming, and we budgeted for and purchased software to streamline the tracking process. Another indicator for objective 1 utilizes continuing education data. Alumni surveys have been utilized in the development of our annual continuing education offerings. (See Standard Three, \"Utilization of Indicators of Mission Success from Core Theme Three: Promote the success of our graduates through our academic, clinical, and research endeavors.) RECOMMENDATIONS FOR C HANGES TO INDICATORS TOWARD UN DERSTANDING FULFILLM ENT OF CORE THEMES The Core Themes each have measurable objectives that are derived from the theme, and indicators for achievement of those objectives have been identified, data collected, and used in understanding o ur accomplishment of our Core Themes. During the Self -Evaluation process, in addition to examining data collected, reviewing how it has been utilized toward initiating improvements, and identifying improvements already implemented, the Task Force also que stioned whether the indicator could be improved upon if utilized in the next seven year accreditation cycle. A number of recommendations were generated toward improvement of indicators. Below is an overview of these recommendations organized sequentially by Core Theme and underlying objectives. Core Theme One: Support Student Success Core Theme One, objective 2, Foster systems that support student success . One of the indicators chosen for this objective was student satisfaction with targeted suppo rt services. The second was rate of attrition, which was also an indicator chosen for mission fulfillment. As the team reviewed attrition data, we realized that, in addition to data and comments from student satisfaction surveys, we were drilling down f rom attrition statistics to analyze the patterns within separation data as well as patterns within academic probation data to inform our success and identification of areas for improvement as regards Core Theme One, objective 2. As a result of this evalua tion, we recommend an expansion of the attrition data indicator. Recommendation: Expand the analysis of attrition data to include identifications of patterns within separation data as well as academic probation data. Core Theme Two: Teaching and Learning - Deliver education that ensures student achievement of competencies within the art and science of natural medicine practice and research Core Theme Two, objective 1, Provide support to faculty in improving their teaching skills. The indicator ch osen obtained faculty opinion on the usefulness of each of the trainings provided to them, specifically capturing the opinion of attendees on whether their skills or knowledge increased as a result of the seminar and whether the faculty member would be abl e to apply what was learned in their own classroom or clinical teaching. The data generated provides NUNM with guidance in the selection of future offerings, but stronger indicators could be developed. NWCCU Year Seven Report 121 2/7/17 Standard Four - Effectiveness and Improvement Recommendation: It is recommended that, in addition to the opinion survey, indicators are developed for the next seven year cycle that measure improvement in teaching skills resulting from supports provided to faculty. Core Theme Two, objective 2, Deliver outcomes based curricula that ensure all graduates achieve the minimum competencies. An indicator chosen for this objective, indicator A, first time pass rates on clinic entrance and exit exams, is also an indicator chosen for mission fulfillme nt. In utilizing this indicator, the Schools of Naturopathic Medicine and Classical Chinese Medicine realized that, although the pass rates provided usable data toward mission fulfillment, they needed to delve more deeply into the data. Patterns of stude nt strengths and weaknesses in the clinic entrance and exit exams were examined within the review of data by the medical programs. The result of that examination led to a number of changes within the exams as well as the curricula and are provided in appe ndix 0.1 under Core Theme Two, objective 2, indicator A - Clinic Entrance and Exit Exams. For the next accreditation cycle, the indicator of pass rates could be strengthened as reflected in this recommendation: Recommendation: Core Theme Two, objective 2A, It is recommended that additional indicators derived from first time pass rate data on clinic entrance and exit exams are developed. Additional indicators could take into consideration the utilization of data to make changes to curricula or to the evaluation process. As discussed in Standard Three under \" College of Classical Chinese Medicine Clinic Exit Exam\", t he CCM discussion of data on clinic exit exams led to a discussion of a new curriculum requirement. The CCM team recommends a program specific indicator is added for Core Theme Two, objective 2, Deliver outcomes based curricula that ensure all graduates a chieve the minimum competencies. Recommendation: For the School of Classical Chinese Medicine, it is recommended that, in the next accreditation cycle, we add an additional program level indicator of mission fulfillment: the creation of a publication -quality case report by each graduating student. Core Theme Two, objective 3, Ensure the curricula retain the classical roots of their medicines. The classical roots of the medicines we teach are core to our institutional mission, reflective of both the a rt and the science of our medicines. The indicator chosen for this objective utilizes mean responses for program specific targeted questions in annual exit surveys of graduating students. This indicator was also chosen as an indicator of mission fulfillme nt. Student opinion as reflected in the exit surveys is a helpful indirect measure that has supported our assessment efforts, and as indicated in Standard Three under \"Classical Roots of the Medicines\" , utilization of data has resulted in a number of chan ges within the curricula. Nonetheless, this indirect measure of success could be augmented by direct measures. Recommendation: Core Theme Two, objective 3. To strengthen our understanding of the level to which we retain the classical roots of our medici nes, it is recommended that, through an inclusive process, NUNM identifies direct measures of achievement of our classical roots to augment existing opinion surveys. Core Theme Three: Promote the success of our graduates through our academic, clinical, and research endeavors Core Theme Three, objective 1, Prepare and support our graduates to work within the professions for which they are trained. NWCCU Year Seven Report 122 2/7/17 Standard Four - Effectiveness and Improvement Among the indicators chosen toward this objective were two specific to the continuing education offerings for the two medical colleges of NUNM. One of these measured the increase in the number of alumni who attend our CE events. The other measured the increase in distance offerings for alumni toward supporting graduates who are not able to commute to events hosted on campus. The data generated by these indicators, as reflected in appendix 0.1 under \"CE Offerings as an indicator of success\", proved useful as an assessment tool, but the Continuing Education Department identified a number of potential indicato rs that could improve our understanding of our success in meeting the continuing education offerings for our medical schools. Recommendation: Core Theme Three, objective 1. It is recommended that improved indicators for promotion of graduate success through continuing medical education offerings are developed for the next cycle. Core Theme Three, objective 2, Prepare students to engage in scholarly interaction with other professionals and support the free exchange of i deas, respectful debate, and other exercises of intellectual curiosity. An indicator chosen was the offering each quarter by each school or college of a forum dedicated toward this objective. Although the objective supports the Core Theme, the indicator of scholarly interaction revolves around simply offering scholarly events within each School or College. As discussed under \"Core Theme Three, Objective 2\" within appendix 0.1 , Narrative on Core Theme Achievement, each program has begun the identification of indicators that could provide data toward understanding the level to w hich our scholarly activities support objective 2. Recommendation: It is recommended that each College or School identify indicators of success specific to their programmatic objectives that support scholarly interaction and the free exchange of ideas. Appendix 0.1 provides further discussion for each of the Colleges and Schools. NWCCU Year Seven Report 123 2/7/17 Standard Five - Mission Fulfillment, A daptation a nd Sustainability STANDARD FIVE - MISSION FULFILLMENT , ADAPTATION AND SUSTAINABILITY ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENT 24: SCALE AND SUSTAINABIL ITY The institution demonstrates that its operational scale (e.g., enrollment, human and financial resources and institutional infrastructure) is sufficient to fulfill its mission and achieve its core th emes in the present and will be sufficient to do so in the foreseeable future. NUNM demonstrates that its operational scale and infrastructure are sufficient to fulfill its mission and Core Themes in several ways. Our DOE ratio, currently at 2.60, has imp roved every year since 2012. Additionally, the institution has run a surplus for the last 10 years, which demonstrates we have sufficient revenue to meet necessary educational expenditures and to set funds aside in reserve. We regularly review enrollment b y program versus tuition income, less direct expenses, and all programs continue to cover their direct costs through tuition and/or revenue. The NUNM Board of Directors has a program review process involving both the Academic Affairs and Financial Affair s Committees. This board oversight ensures new programs are financially feasible and are programmatically in line with our mission and Core Themes. Administrative oversight of budgets and projected costs ensures there will be future allocations of funds to meet programmatic goals. NUNM develops and publishes evidence -based evaluations regarding the extent to which it is fulfilling its mission, goals, and Core Themes and communicates the results of assessment to its community. As the institution monitors its achievements, it also maintains a pulse on the future and retains the flexibility to address evolving needs. Beginning in Standard 5.A. below, is an overview of our ongoing assessment processes, changes that have been made as a result of these processes, and a review of the internal and external influences that have guided the institution toward sustainability. STANDARD 5.A - MISSION FULFILLMENT ASSESSMENT OF ACCOMP LISHMENTS (5.A.1) The Framework for Action , the development of which includes community input, guides the institution in its ac hievement of its mission and is organized into two sections, \"the framework\" and \"the action\". The framework identifies the evolving structure of the university including governance, management, and organizational structure, and details accountabilities a nd relationships among the elements of the institution. The action section identifies the current five -year set of goals and key progress indicators toward achieving the goals. All strategic objectives or activity deriving from a goal have assigned manage rs, who report on their progress with the plan at each board meeting. The President's Cabinet has operational oversight of the Framework as part of its regular accountabilities. The Framework and processes are described more fully in Standard Three. Accomp lishment of the strategic plan is tracked through SPOL, our strategic planning database. NUNM systematically assesses institutional and programmatic accomplishments utilizing direct and indirect measures. In addition to tracking achievement of the compo nents of our strategic plan, SPOL tracks the timeline for completion of assessment processes of the institution's assessment plan. This database is maintained by the Office of Institutional Research and Compliance (IRC). SPOL also links Core Themes to plan ning goals and tracks assessment methods for achievement of departmental objectives. Assessment processes are participatory, in accord with NUNM's perspective on inclusiveness, which our board views as a component of respect, one of our core values. (See the NUNM alignme nt model discussed in Standard One, page 33 ). NWCCU Year Seven Report 124 2/7/17 Standard Five - Mission Fulfillment, A daptation a nd Sustainability As discussed in Standard Two, 2.F., our annual budget planning process is also a collaborative effort. Budget preparation includes participation by all budget unit heads and ongoing review of the budget at departmental level as well as the President's Cabinet and board. The systematic review of the approved budget has four phases: 1) Development and appro val of expected revenue, costs, and planned contingencies for the next fiscal period; 2) after each add -drop period, review of actual revenue and expense against budget and adjustments to the budget; 3) immediate adjustment of negative variances of cost ce nters that are outside the budget; 4) continuous monitoring of deliverables. The CFO, the provost, and the president review the university -wide business plan routinely each month and each quarter, with one eye on cash flow and approved disbursements and t he other on significant changes against plan. Our assessment tools capture input from students, patients, faculty, graduates, and staff. When developing a survey, we solicit input from all pertinent departments. For example, the content of the graduate e xit survey is reviewed annually by academic leadership as well as by the PCRC. The student satisfaction survey questions are also reviewed annually. As discussed in Standard Four, Section One, data resulting from assessment efforts, including results of bo th of these surveys, are widely distributed. Further evidence of our efforts toward inclusiveness is our work toward development of an equity plan. In 2016, NUNM contracted with a local organization, the Center for Equity and Inclusion, to assist NUNM in the development of an Equity Plan and Equity Team for the University. The Equity Team began meeting in January 2017 to develop competencies needed to build equitable and culturally inclusive policies, practices, and protocols across the institution. A s well, NUNM community stakeholders composed of faculty, students, board members, staff, and administration participated in a two -day training facilitated by the Metropolitan Alliance for Common Good, a division of Industrial Areas Foundation Northwest foc used on community and educational organizational cooperation and growth. Other examples are the participation of the SGA and Faculty Senate in reframing the Core Themes as part of our Year Three Report; our long history of a faculty and student driven cur riculum committee (PCRC); and inclusion of elected representatives from our students, faculty, and staff as non -voting members of the board. DETERMINATION OF MISSION FULFILLMENT (5.A.2) The NUNM strategic plan, A Framework for Action , was devel oped to define success of t he institution in the achievement of its mission in the current fi ve year planning cycle. As indicated in Standard Three, section one of the strategic plan describes the \"framework\" and section t wo the \"action steps \". Section Three (pages 47, 48, and 49 of the Framework ) defines the level to which we are fulfilling our mission by detaili ng the timelines for completion of the action plan and accountabilities . Mission fulfillment is further clarified by the six indicator s selected from our Core Themes. As discussed in Standard Three, NUNM has captured data regarding our success in meeting each of these indicators and utilized these efforts toward implementing improvements. Standard 4.B. details methods used to communicate assessment results to appropriate constituencies and the public. Improvements generated as a result of assessment of the six indicators of mission fulfillment defined for the NWCCU Seven Year Cycle are discussed in Standard Three and summarized below. CHANGES AS A RESULT OF ASSESSMENT OF CORE THEMES (5.A.2) Student attrition data (Core Theme One, Objective 2) Access to attrition data is provided in the Factbook on the NUNM website: http://nunm.edu/about/quick - facts -figures/graduation -statistics . Separation data is provided to the board, which includes constituency representatives, within fall, winter and sp ring reports of the provost, and is posted on the assessment page of Moodle. Student Life tracks the reasons students have left NUNM to identify patterns that can lead to academic and behavioral challenges and, potentially, separation from the institution . NWCCU Year Seven Report 125 2/7/17 Standard Five - Mission Fulfillment, A daptation a nd Sustainability Attrition statistics are augmented by analysis of patterns of comments in response to surveys, such as the annual student satisfaction survey, and data that tracks the reasons for separation of students from NUNM. Reviewing this qualitative and quant itative data resulted in planning for and implementation of a number of expanded services. Analysis of compiled data indicated that transfer students and underrepresented students are more likely to be on academic probation than their peers, which can lea d to dismissal or voluntary withdrawal. In response, a new position, associate dean of academic progress, was implemented in 2011 and dedicated to providing academic counseling and coordinating services for at -risk students. Since then, the position has ev olved into the Center for Academic Success under the Office of Student Life. The Center centralizes academic advising for students of all degree programs, oversees the newly created Testing Center designed in response to the growing number of students with testing accommodation (and other) needs, has developed an academic e arly alert system, made improvements to the faculty advising system, supports the program deans on continuing to improve faculty training in strategies to better serve student learning ou tcomes, and has developed a learning strategies guide for students that is accessible from the NUNM website. Other positions added in response to the recognized need to improve student retention include formation in 2010 of an on -campus Counseling Center available without charge to students; the 2011 appointment of a career services position; the 2015 appointment of an intercultural engagement and support manager; the January 2016 appointment of a director of student life and conduct, freeing the AVP of s tudent affairs/dean of students to provide higher level planning and oversight of this division of the institution; and reorganization of administrative areas in 2016 to include an AVP of enrollment management. Utilizing these expanded resources, we have i ncreased faculty training on teaching to multiple learning styles, increased cultural competency training of our faculty and staff to further understanding of cultural issues as they relate to being a student as well as the unique needs of marginalized pat ients, and expanded cultural competency training throughout the curricula of our students. First -time pass rates on clinical entrance and exit exams for students in the first professional degree programs (Core Theme Two, objective 2) As discussed in Stan dard Three, pass rates are shared by the deans with faculty, leading to changes in curriculum delivery and within the exams themselves. Within the College of Classical Chinese Medicine, faculty noted a pattern of increased utilization by students of online applications for foundational knowledge, which faculty believe negatively impacted performance on these gatekeeping exams, and faculty now actively encourage students to memorize rather than utilize digital applications. Annual comprehensive exams are being developed to supplement the clinic entrance exam. Question banks have been expanded. Students are encouraged by faculty to write test questions as part of their coursework to promote critical thinking and clinical reasoning. A practical portion of the clinic entrance exam using a level -appropriate version of the grading rubric employed in the clinic exit examination is being developed, and the exit exam is being expanded to include an OSCE -type process similar to the one currently used in the na turopathic program discussed below. In response to patterns of weakness within exit exams, students now are required to prepare a minimum of two clinical case presentations that consider conditions for which the family history is highly significant. Stude nts and faculty have expanded training in writing case reports toward addressing deficiencies identified within students' exit exams. Within the School of Naturopathic Medicine , three milestone exams, Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs), are utilized. The structure of the exit exam was similar to the entrance and progression exams until 2013, when the exit exam became a multi -station exam evaluating student skills in a variety of shorter patient scenarios. The exam format was revised in o rder to align the NUNM exit exam with the best practices of the majority of academic medical institutions, and to assure that we were assessing student performance in a variety of health conditions and situations, versus evaluating them based on a single p atient scenario. An open -book written exam was added to further evaluate students' abilities to use NWCCU Year Seven Report 126 2/7/17 Standard Five - Mission Fulfillment, A daptation a nd Sustainability resources to answer questions about possible diagnoses, laboratory evaluation, and conventional and natural treatment options. Each year, the individual pa rts of each OSCE exam are analyzed and areas of weakness and strength are identified. Faculty are informed annually of specific strengths and weaknesses in student performance for the purpose of making curriculum adjustments. The re -conceptualized ND curr iculum, developed by faculty teams utilizing student and faculty input, considered the strengths and weaknesses of students as reflected in the three OSCE exams as it reconstructed the ND curriculum. Clinical competencies developed by a subcommittee of the American Association of Naturopathic Medical Colleges (AANMC) was a source of external data used to inform the reconstruction of our ND clinical competencies, the measurement of which is reflected throughout the OSCE exams. First -time pass rates for grad uates of the first professional degree programs for the NPLEX (Naturopathic Medicine) and NCCAOM (Acupuncture and Herbal Medicine) examinations (Core Theme Two, objective 2) Pass rates on external licensure exams are accessible to the community in the Fac tbook on the NUNM website : The deans and faculty discuss licensure exam pass rates in faculty meetings to make changes in delivery of education. As discussed in Standard Three, areas of weakness were identified within both the CCM and ND licensure pass rates. The 2014 pass rates for the Chinese Herbal Exam (CHE) were remarkably lower than the na tional average and were the lowest recorded pass rate for our CCM students. Changes made as a result include development of an herbal education timeline; changes in the content of the herbs review class to expand the base of formulas ; creation by faculty o f a study guide for formulas typically on the licensure exams; expansion of the list of single herbs covered in the first year herbs classes; modified curriculum of the second year herbs classes to include a broader and more extensive range of formulas; a nd focus in the third year on integration of biomedical, TCM and classical approaches to treatment, including herbal prescription. While it is too early to see the full effect of all of these changes, the 2015 NCCAOM results saw a dramatic 30 percent incre ase from the previous year (70% versus 40%), compared to the national results, which only increased by .2% (80.2% versus 80%). For ND students, in August 2014 t here was a clear dip in pass rate for the basic science boards: 70% compared with the nation al mean for students in all schools of 74%. As discussed in Standard Three, a review indicated that concurrently we experienced a change in our anatomy faculty. In summer 2015, we supplemented the education students already received by contracting with fa culty to develop and teach a free-to-students basic science review class focused heavily on anatomy. To our knowledge this is the only class of its kind within accredited ND programs. In summer 2016, the review course was expanded from 36 hours to approxim ately 85 hours, with an expanded anatomy review and reviews for physiology, microbiology, immunology, and biochemistry. The August 2015 NPLEX scores showed a clear improvement with a pass rate of 91% compared with a national mean of 80%. In August 2016, N UNM was 80%, above the national mean of 76%. Our curriculum mapping of the ND degree has been expanded to identify where NPLEX board topics appear within the curriculum. Mean responses for specifically targeted questions in program level annual exit sur veys with questions designed toward understanding the level to which the curricula retain the classical roots of their medicines (Core Theme Two, Objective 3) The results of the graduating class exit surveys are shared widely on campus, including on the assessment page of the Moodle site and with the constituency -inclusive Program and Curriculum Review Committee. As discussed in Standard Three, the review of dat a from specifically targeted questions in annual exit surveys informs our understanding of student perception of the level to which the curricula retain the NWCCU Year Seven Report 127 2/7/17 Standard Five - Mission Fulfillment, A daptation a nd Sustainability classical roots of their medicines and is used in curriculum reform and development. For example, t he recent curriculum redesign in the ND program, which included expansion of coursework emphasizing the classical roots of naturopathic medicine, was informed by annual exit survey data, comments analyzed from student satisfaction surveys and focus groups, faculty focus and work groups, and a dedicated curriculum review e -mail address for sharing input. Within the School of Research and Graduate Studies , additional coursework was added to the required curriculum of the MScGH as a result of lower than antici pated student agreement with one of the indicators identified toward meeting the classical perspective of the program. The recent revisions to the curriculum of the MSOM program and the development of the DSOM, which delves more deeply into study of Chines e Medicine through the classics, utilized data and examination of comments from exit and student satisfaction surveys. The classical roots (the art and science) of the medicines we teach are core to our institutional mission. Although the indirect measures identified for this accreditation cycle are helpful toward informing mission fulfillment and curricula changes, more d irect measures would strengthen our understanding of this aspect of mission fulfillment. As discussed in Standard Four, a recommendation resulting from this self -evaluation process is that, through an inclusive process, NUNM identifies direct measures of a chievement of our classical roots to augment existing opinion surveys. An analysis of comments from student satisfaction and graduating student exit surveys and focus groups indicates that the classical roots of our medicines is a topic of particular inte rest to our students, and representatives of our Student Government Association will participate in development of new indicators for this objective to be used in the next Seven Year NWCCU Self-Evaluation cycle. Percentage of alumni who report they are e mployed in a field directly related to their NUNM degree &alumni perception of how well NUNM prepared them for a career in their profession (Core Theme Three, objective 1) Income and employment results are regularly included on the agenda of the Board Aca demic Affairs Committee and are posted on Moodle and on the website: http://nunm.edu/wp -content/uploads/2015/03/Alumni_Survey_2014_Income_Results1.pdf . Due to limited employment data for the specific fields NUNM alumni enter, the placement and wage data of our alumni is a resource shared with and used by stakeholders such as other educational institutions and professional associations related to key occupati ons. Data on use of degree, type of employment, and income is used to help NUNM and affiliated schools understand the alignment of education with industry needs. As discussed in Standard Three, NUNM continues to expand resources for promoting the success of our graduates, taking into consideration placement data of alumni one year after graduation, alumni responses to surveys concerning their area of employment, and alumni perception of how well NUNM prepared them for a career in their professions. The NUN M Center for Career Development, which reports to the Enrollment Management Division, uses placement and income data to analyze and compare with trends that are observed through market research and through support to stakeholders. The Center then shares th e data with students and alumni for review when they are considering adding or dropping degree programs, career goals, applying for jobs, and negotiating contracts and wages. In addition, employers request information from the Center to define job opening s and determine wages. This process then informs the planning for the Center, including career fair vendor invitations, talks, and workshops provided each term. The School of Naturopathic Medicine has utilized information from alumni and external precep tor faculty, as well as surveys of current and graduating students to improve our curricula in support of success after graduation. The ND Community Experience Preceptorship program helps prepare students for a private practice outside of the NUNM Health C enter environment and provides the opportunity to explore clinical areas of special interest. NWCCU Year Seven Report 128 2/7/17 Standard Five - Mission Fulfillment, A daptation a nd Sustainability Similarly, the School of Research and Graduate Studies has initiated improvements based upon student and external faculty input to inform development of a Globa l Health Fieldwork Manual, assignment of faculty mentors to assess gaps in students' current skills prior to selection of fieldwork projects and locations, refinement to rubrics for final presentations and reports, and standardized on -site evaluations for site managers. Alumni employment outcomes inform the focus of the fieldwork, and students are strongly encouraged to ensure their fieldwork aligns with career goals. This process maximizes the ability to practice foundational knowledge in a realistic fram ework while building skill sets for resumes and work. The School of Classical Chinese Medicine has taken Business Seminar 1 and 2 classes previously taught in the final year of the curriculum and distributed that curriculum over the four years of study, starting with the first year. From the very beginning, students are now focused on how they will apply the knowledge and skills to their future practice. NUNM continues to seek and obtain increased funding for residencies for ND and CCM graduates. Our Office of Advancement, Continuing Education and Alumni Affairs takes into consideration alumni survey data to improve continuing education and other alumni services. CE continues to expand its remote offerings, a need identified from alumni surveys. The alum ni section of the NUNM website provides alumni survey data, information concerning services of the Career and Alumni Center, positions available, and practice locations for rent or sale, and helps to maintain connections throughout the NUNM community and e ngage alumni and partners in campus life. Business, direct consumer, and alumni demand is considered in the development of the website and CE offerings to assure both current and emerging workforce development needs are met. STANDARD 5.B - ADAPTATION AN D SUSTAINABILITY NUNM's review of the effectiveness of its operations toward fulfilling its mission, accomplishment of its core themes and objectives, and achievement of its goals includes internal review as well as capturing input from external resources . Review of Internal Processes As discussed in Standard Two, in the current planning cycle (2012 -2017) that guided this NWCCU Seven Year Cycle, NUNM adopted its long range Campus Master Plan, which was approved by the City of Portland. The Plan provides a blueprint for future campus de velopment and growth and acknowledges NUNM in the City's future plans for the campus footprint. This plan was the culmination of several years of effort that included a Charrette community process with internal and external constituency representation, arc hitectural studies, site use studies and consultations, and active participation by the neighborhood association. The Campus Master Plan has guided us in the approval of capital projects. Examples include the repurposing of the former clinic building into Helfgott Research Institute; purchase of a pivotal house within our blueprint leading to permission by the City to decommission a street that will be transformed into a sustainable food/park like setting; creation of Galen's Way Garden; and installation of HVAC into Mitchell Hall, the largest lecture hall within the Academic Building. (5.B.1) The master plan and the strategic plan inform fundraising efforts. The NUNM Case Statement outlines short, medium, and long term advancement objectives that are tied directly to the priorities outlined in the Framework for Action and guide the efforts of our Advancement Department. These are related to capital projects, the financing of academic and clinic activity, community outreach, campus development, new equipment and facilities, public relations, and university branding. The university has a comprehensive set of Advancement Policies that contemplate all forms of monetary and in -kind donations to the university in terms of approvals and assimilation of gifts into the university's business plan, campus facilities, and general operations. \"The Partners Program\" guides our advancement officers in standards and processes for canvassing , cultivating, and closing potential \"asks\". The priorities outlined in The NUNM Case Statement NWCCU Year Seven Report 129 2/7/17 Standard Five - Mission Fulfillment, A daptation a nd Sustainability are tied directly to the priorities outlined in the Framework for Action . Our additi onal academic and green space needs guided asks that resulted in funds to create our teaching kitchen, were used in creation of Galen's Way Garden, will support transforming the vacated street into a garden, and fund creation of a second teaching kitchen. (5.B.1) NUNM reviews the effectiveness of its processes and modifies them as needed. For example, NIFTY (New Initiatives for This Year) is a university -wide process currently under development that builds on and will replace the former PPQ (Pre -Project Questionnaire) framework planning tool. The PPQ was created to guide the evolution of new programs but was not utilized for other institutional initiatives. NIFTY requires detailed sign -offs by all affected managers of cost centers in the university befor e an initiative is launched, including capital projects, policy and process change, facilities change, and equipment acquisition, in addition to new programs. NIFTY encourages creativity and the generation of improvements that align with the university's v alues, priorities, and capacity and intersects with appropriate academic approvals for courses, programs, and curriculum change. (5.B.2) Another example of changes to processes is a revamping of the PCRC. Our curriculum committee has served for at least t hree decades, the longest standing committee of NUNM. As our program mix continues to differentiate and diversify, the PCRC has expanded to include student and faculty representation from each new school or college. The agenda for the PCRC has become, as a result, quite heavy. With the goal of ensuring inclusion of new stakeholders and recognizing the growing interdependence of academic offerings in terms of human resources, cross -curriculum content, and prudent facilities management, a new process is bein g develop called URAP, University Review and Approval Process. It is anticipated that this committee, to include elected representatives from our students, faculty, and staff, will be implemented in the coming academic year. (5.B.2) Our administrative re organization in 2015 and 2016 included appointment of two associate vice presidents and their addition to the senior administrative team of the institution. This change provides direct representation of student affairs and enrollment management to the Pres ident's Cabinet and reflects our commitment to evaluation of existing structures and modification as needed to support our growth and priorities. (5.B.2) Our faculty classification, compensation, and evaluation processes are another example of ongoing cha nges in response to identified need. NUNM is developing a new Faculty Classification and Compensation model that is projected for launch in FY 2017 -18 that provides for equitable compensation across the curriculum for faculty at different levels in a \"ste p model\" reflecting credentials, experience and workload assignments. There are several motivators for the development of this new system. Some faculty now teach academic and or clinical coursework in multiple programs, schools, and colleges, building a work -load from multiple budget areas and creating a more complex reporting structure. Added to this shift in faculty assignments is our desire to more clearly define the career path of faculty. As well, the new system provides academic managers and facul ty with much improved cross -program and inter -disciplinary assignments, improving efficiency of delivery and strengthening job security for our teachers. The new system also compensates faculty for specific tasks and assignments in three areas of academic life: classroom and clinic teaching, scholarship, and university/community service. In accordance with the values of the institution, faculty representatives are participants in the development process. Faculty will also review the final model before implementation through the Faculty Senate as well as faculty meetings. (5.B.2) Faculty have long been involved in the review and delivery of processes that impact them. For example, the Faculty Development Committee, a subcommittee of the Faculty Senate, is composed of representatives from each college and school and is charged with recommendations for promotion in rank and awarding of sabbaticals, and oversees allocation of some of NUNM's funding for faculty development offerings. A review of and modifications to our faculty processes began in 2011 with a task force of academic lead ers and the development of draft faculty competencies that were vetted through the Faculty Senate prior to NWCCU Year Seven Report 130 2/7/17 Standard Five - Mission Fulfillment, A daptation a nd Sustainability implementation. These competencies guide program deans in the annual evaluation of faculty and were considered in the creation of new faculty evaluat ion tools used within our schools and colleges. A recommendation that resulted from this Self -Evaluation, Continue to prioritize development of a system in which faculty evaluations, expected faculty competencies, faculty development, promotions, and the f aculty compensation system are integrated and reinforce one another , reflects our commitment to implementing our new Faculty Classification and Compensation system. (5.B.1) The External Environment Our reframed ND and MSOM programs, the development of th e DSOM, and curricula within the School of Research and Graduate Studies and the School of Undergraduate Studies were faculty driven. NUNM's perspective of inclusiveness also extends beyond the immediate NUNM community to external influences as it consider s the evolution of its degree programs and services. Our two medical schools receive input from regular interaction in semiannual meetings with their specialty accrediting agencies and with other accredited medical institutions. The OSCE clinic exams dev eloped for our ND program and under development for our MSOM and DSOM were heavily influenced by best practices within the medical profession as a whole. Closer to home, as mentioned above under First -time pass rates on clinical entrance and exit , our ND clinical competencies were guided by those developed cooperatively by specialty accredited naturopathic medical schools through the Association of Accredited Naturopathic Medical Colleges. Our dean of naturopathic medicine served as chair of the subcommit tee that led this process, the Council of Chief Academic and Clinic Officers. NUNM also has a strong presence at the annual International Congress on Naturopathic Medicine in Europe. (5.B.3) CCM developed a new evaluation tool for clinic rotations that i s based on the developmental milestone tool used by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education in the assessment of residents in the medical field. Case report training throughout the CCM program is modeled on CAse REport (CARE) guidelines. Representatives from the CCM administration and Institutional Research are active participants in the committees of the Council of Colleges of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine, a voluntary membership organization composed of specialty accredited schools. Our administrators serve as chairs of CCAOM committees such as Student Services, Faculty Development, and First Professional Doctorate and are active members of the Curriculum and Accreditation Committees. This participation brought valuable input into th e development of our DSOM and the reframing of our MSOM, influenced the development of our faculty competencies, and augments the perspective of our AVP of student life, who also is appointed by the Oregon Attorney General to the Oregon Sexual Assault Task Force. (5.B.3) The School of Research and Graduate Studies similarly employs external input. MSiMH (mental health) faculty review and use guidance from licensure, accreditation and professional organizations in program development, such as the Oregon Boa rd of Licensed Professional Counselors and Therapists, The Hakomi Institute, and Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs. Research subject areas for our MSiMR program and our Helfgott Research Institute are informed by fun ding initiatives and through conferences of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Program content of the MSiMR is informed by workshops of the NIH International Research Congress on Integrative Medicine and Health (IRCIMH) . (5.B.3) Decisions about the MSiMR were influenced by our evaluation of statistics for entrance into PhD programs. We discovered that, for many of the PhD science programs, the acceptance rate is only 7% or less. We had presumed that completion of a master's program such as ones wit hin SoRGS would be advantageous to a PhD program applicant. The implication for NUNM is that even if a student earned a master's, the acceptance rate into a PhD program was small. A job survey we conducted revealed that the same research coordinator positi ons were available to people whether they had a master's degree or not. These two paths were primary post -graduation tracks for our stand - alone MSiMR students. Since neither seem viable, we have stopped marketing our MSiMR program to stand -alone students. The same is true for our MScGH. NWCCU Year Seven Report 131 2/7/17 Standard Five - Mission Fulfillment, A daptation a nd Sustainability There are several conferences that impact the program. The American Public Health Association conference and the Integrative Medicine for Underserved (IM4US) conference have helped to inform the curriculum. (5.B.3) Inter nally, our School of Research and Graduate Studies closely evaluates student and faculty feedback, and the career trajectories of our graduates. For example, in Nutrition, we noted that our graduates were pursuing four different career paths rather than th e two we originally predicted. We had assumed they would pursue clinical nutrition or community nutrition. We discovered our MScN students are also pursuing culinary/personal chef and environmental nutrition paths (an emerging career within the field). We have now adjusted the MScN curriculum to offer four tracks of electives within the program. (5.B.3) In the early planning stages for the School of Undergraduate Studies, interviews were conducted with a cross -section of experienced NUNM faculty representative of each of our graduate programs in naturopathic medicine, Chinese medicine, and integrative medical research. Faculty were asked to describe qualities and skill sets they considered ideal in candidates for NUNM graduate and medical programs . Faculty feedback ranged from courses in which they wished students had stronger backgrounds (for example, biochemistry, botany) to skills of behavioral maturity, critical thinking, knowledge integration, quantitative literacy, and articulateness in spok en and written communication, all skills which faculty considered were increasingly under -developed in the current generation of students. Externally we talked with more than \u00bd dozen local institutions concerning their undergraduate programs, including pot ential AA/AS feeder programs, for guidance in the development of our own undergraduate degrees. In addition, we surveyed currently enrolled NUNM students to ask how interested they would have been to complete their undergraduate degree or their science pre -requisite courses at NUNM if this option had been available to them. Also utilized in program development was information gathered by the president of NUNM through focus groups, information seminars, and presentations for students, faculty, and administra tion at 11 institutions of higher education, both in Oregon and across the country. His goal was to provide information about NUNM and to gather data about interest in current programs and possible new directions. (5.B.1 and 5.B.3) Currently, major influ ences in the development of new programs include the following : We continue to round out the Traditional World Medicines represented by the university. This has led to the development of an Ayurveda degree program, the content of which has been approved by NUNM's internal processes. This program is expected to be submitted to NWCCU in early 2017. As well, the university has plans to launch a World Medicine Institute in the NUNM Institutes that will incubate continuing education activity, research, and inte r-departmental collaboration. We evaluated the focus of local (University of Oregon) undergraduates who were pursuing health careers. We discovered that the number pursuing pre -health had jumped from 100 to 1,000 per year and that students were attracted t o U of O because of their top tier football team and the fact that the Olympic trials were held there. The interest and focus on health care and sports reinforced development of our Masters in Sports Medicine to attract those students. The aging population within the US has led us to explore degrees in gerontology and geriatrics. We have not settled on a degree because we have not yet analyzed whether there is enough specialized information in integrative gerontology or integrative geriatrics to warrant a d egree. The counseling/psychology field is one that interests us; however, after looking at the strengths of the other graduate programs in our vicinity, we discovered that the program at Pacific University is strong. Rather than compete with that program, we will collaborate with them in research and change our focus to a mental health specialty for clinical students. We are in the early stages of developing an undergraduate \"integrative therapeutics\" concentration, NWCCU Year Seven Report 132 2/7/17 Standard Five - Mission Fulfillment, A daptation a nd Sustainability which can be an excellent foundation for our current and emerging graduate program mix, as well as a contribution to the state's 40 -40-20 objective to have 40 per cent of Oregonians with a baccalau reate degree or higher by 2025. As discussed under Standard Three, the board formally launched pr eparation for the 2017 -22 planning cycle in 2014 with a brainstorming workshop utilizing a four-quadrant model similar to a SWOT analysis . The workshop, Vision & Voice 2022 Gathering , included administrators, staff, alumni, patients, suppliers, higher education associates, SGA, Faculty Senate , and Staff Association representatives. Participants were divided into small group s, with each group facilitated by a board member. Part one of t he workshop asked participants: \"In thinking about our institution's approach to natural medicine , what is working ? What is missing? What doubts do you have ? What excites you? \" In part two, participants were asked, \"In thinking about our institution holding 'the leading edge' of natural medicine, at what crossroads does the school find itself? How does the institution position itself to be at the leading edge? What qualities does the institution need to hold? What does success look like in the fu ture? \" A document providing the concepts carried back to the board from this workshop is available on campus. In 2014, 2015, and 2016 the Strategic Pathways Committee and the board as a whole incorporate d input from the brainstorming w orkshop toward creation of key strategies to guide the university for 2017 -22 in cultivating its core educational values for mission fulfillment. These strategies are designed to provide a clear path for administrators in the process of planning, budgeting, and im plementing measurable departmental goals and will provide a launching point for creation of the goals, objectives , and indicators for the next NWCCU seven year cycle. (5.B.3 ) NWCCU Year Seven Report 133 2/7/17 2/7/17 Conclusions CONCLUSIONS National University of Natural Medicine has strategically planned for and successfully implemented significant growth during our 2012 -17 planning cycle, which provided the Framework for Action for our current NWCCU seven year accreditation cycle. On September 29, 2015, the Higher Education Coordinating Commission gave the institution permission to use the word \"Univ ersity\" in our name, following NWCCU approval on September 11. Under Oregon Administrative Rule 583 -030-0016, \" The term 'university' refers exclusively to a school that is authorized to offer bachelor's degrees together with graduate or first professional degrees.\" We have expanded from two core areas of focus - first professional medical training in naturopathic medicine and classical Chinese medicine - to providing nine academic program s, organized into two schools, Undergraduate and Graduate Studies, and two medical colleges, Naturopathic Medicine and Classical Chinese Medicine. The graduating class of June 2016 was the largest one in our 60 year history, as was our class entering in fall 2016. We have carefully planned for and welcomed into our communi ty our first undergraduate students, who join our graduate and medical students in their commitment to natural medicine. NUNM's clinic services to the community have flourished in recent years. As a result of a grant through the Institute for Healthcare Improvement Learning Collaborative, NUNM Health Center is now attested as a Patient -Centered Primary Care Home through the Oregon Health Authority (OHA) . Washington County has provided NUNM with a grant to deliver care to underserved members of the commun ity, and a second grant from OHA together with our partner Virginia Garcia Memorial Health Center allows us to focus on pediatric and adolescent patients . In addition, we have opened a second clinic, augmenting our on -campus clinic, located in nearby Bea verton immediately adjacent to local rapid transit. Community clinic student rotations provide service to the larger community as well as an expanded patient base to our students, including collaboration with Portland Cascade AIDS Project to provide primar y care at Pivot, an LGBTQ community space; Providence Medical Center's Cancer Center Infusion Clinic; Portland Veteran's Acupuncture Project; Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU) Richmond; Volunteers of America (VOA) - InAct ( addictions treatment, m ental health and wellness services); VOA - Men's Resource Center; Portland Community College - Workforce; Outside In (homeless youth); Central City Concern (homeless individuals); Hooper Detox; Mt. Olivet Baptist Church; Rose Haven (homeless women and families); Pacific University (Hillsboro and SW Portland); Ahn Hao Clinic; and Immune Enhancement Project (IEP). The university's Helfgott Research Institute is home to a growing body of evidence -based natural medicine research. In 2015, the Institute was awarded two prestigious research grants totaling more than $3 million from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) - National Center for Complementary and Integrative Medicine (NCCAM) . The first grant studies Mindfulness -based Stress Reduction for Multiple Sclerosis. The second provides training for conventionally -trained scientists to translate and apply the concepts of complementary and integrative medicine. In 2016, Helfgott successfully concluded its second four -year R25 research education grant, also f unded by NIH, which provided training for faculty in teaching evidence - based medicine. Helfgott has published manuscripts that detailed activities that could be undertaken at other institutions and offered EBM workshops on the campus of four other univers ities. The institute continues to conduct company and donor -funded research in areas relevant to natural and integrative medicine. Faculty and students are regularly published in peer -reviewed journals and present their research at national and internatio nal conferences. Our campus footprint is firmly established and officially recognized by the City of Portland, and we are headed into our seventh decade strong and poised confidently for a future that wants and needs the unique strengths provided by our graduates. NWCCU Year Seven Report 134 2/7/17 2/7/17 Conclusions Our comprehensive self -evaluation process was collaborative and inclusive. Through this process, we have identified areas of improvement, and these are enumerated below. Recommendations are listed under the area within this self -evaluation in which they were initially introduced. OVERVIEW OF INSTITUTIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS Recommendations Introduced under Core Themes, Objectives, and Indicators Core Theme One, objective 2, Foster systems that support student success . Expand the analysis of attrition data to include identifications of patterns within separation as well as academic probation data. Core Theme Two, objective 1, Provide support to faculty in improving their teaching skills. Indicators chosen captured faculty opinion on the usefu lness of the training NUNM provided to them, specifically opinion on whether their skills or knowledge increased as a result of the seminar and whether the faculty member would be able to apply what was learned in their own classroom or clinical teaching. It is recommended that, in addition to the opinion survey, indicators are developed for the next seven year cycle that measure improvement in teaching skills resulting from supports provided to faculty. Core Theme Two, objective 2A, Deliver outcomes based curricula that ensure all graduates achieve the minimum competencies. It is recommended that additional indicators derived from first time pass rate data on clinic entrance and exit exams are developed. Additional indicators could take into consideration the utilization of data to make changes to curricula or to the evaluation process. Core Theme Two, objective 2A , Deliver outcomes based curricula that ensure all graduates achieve the minimum competencies. For the School of Classical Chinese Medicine, it is recommended that, in the next accreditation cycle, we add an additional program level indicator of mission fulfillment: the creation of a publication -quality case report by each graduating student. Core Theme Two, objective 3, Ensure the c urricula retain the classical roots of their medicines. It is recommended that, through an inclusive process, NUNM identifies direct measures of achievement of our classical roots to augment existing opinion surveys. Core Theme Three, objective 1, Prepa re and support our graduates to work within the professions for which they are trained. It is recommended that improved indicators for promotion of graduate success through continuing medical education offerings are developed for the next cycle . Appendix 0.1 provides further discussion of possible indicators. Core Theme Three, objective 2, Prepare students to engage in scholarly interaction with other professionals and support the free exchange of ideas, respectful debate, and other exercises of intellect ual curiosity. Although the objective supports the Core Theme, the indicators of scholarly interaction revolve around simply offering scholarly events within each School or College. It is recommended that each College or School identify indicators of succ ess specific to their programmatic objectives that support scholarly interaction and the free exchange of ideas. Appendix 0.1 provides further discussion for each of the Colleges and Schools. Recommendations Introduced under Preface The schedules of some students in Academic Year 2016 -17 was not optimal utilizing existing classrooms. With new classes offered in the coming year, it is recommended that an additional classroom is identified and converted for the coming academic year. The Office of Admissions will continue to monitor the need for program -specific admissions NWCCU Year Seven Report 135 2/7/17 2/7/17 Conclusions counselors, especially within the multi -program School of Research and Graduate Studies. Recommendations Introduced under Standard Two Continue to prioritize development of a system in which faculty evaluations, expected faculty competencies, faculty development, promotions, and the faculty compensation system are integrated and reinforce one another. Continue to review data on counseling services use and wait list for the Counseling Center and, based upon that review and as budget permits, consider funding for increased staffing, space, and hours of operation and/or other methods to address student needs. Continue to search for course scheduling software tha t could substitute for our manual process. Continue to monitor student satisfaction with the registration process through the annual student satisfaction survey and, if needed, follow -up surveys and focus groups. Pursue implementation of a new functi on available in SONIS that will allow for more automated tracking of attrition. It is anticipated that this function will allow more reliable tracking by cohort for students who change programs, complete two programs, or add a program after their initial matriculation date. Implementation of this new function requires back filling of data so that reports can be generated. Beginning in academic year 2017 -18, for courses that are completed in asynchronous format, require second party verification in addit ion to a statement of authentication. Continue to review short - and long -term options for expansion of library space and budget improvements in coming years. Continue to monitor student satisfaction with and make improvements as needed to student st udy space. In the 2017 -18 budget, request for an additional 0.75 FTE, professional librarian position with primary responsibility of managing electronic resources and digital initiatives, with additional responsibility of contributing to reference and ins truction services.
