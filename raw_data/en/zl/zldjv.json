You may choose to use [herbs](https://crystalvisions.net.au/collections/smudge-sticks), rinse them under water or use a larger crystal. But the most powerful way to do this, in my opinion, is by making sure they are put out to bathe in the Full Moon's light. If you miss the exact Full Moon it's OK. Putting them out the night before or night after the Moon is full will do just as well. Some people like to use Sage to cleanse crystals, you can check out our range [here](https://crystalvisions.net.au/collections/smudge-sticks) Below is a very basic how-to, when it comes to cleansing your crystals with the Full Moon; 1. Collect your crystals together, take them outside in the moonlight and lay them out. You may even like to do a crystal grid with them when you lay them out. ( You can learn more about crystal grids [here](https://crystalvisions.net.au/blogs/an-introduction-to-crystal-grids/an-introduction-to-crystal-grids).) Ideally, they should be placed on the earth or a natural surface. Crystals like to be earthed or grounded, just like our bodies do. If you don't have access to some earth or lawn to place them on, you can also just place them on a windowsill or on a natural surface like a wooden plate, on a balcony. It's perfect if they are in the moonlight - even if that moon is behind clouds, it's OK! It's more about the crystals being in alignment with the Moon's energy as it passes by where ever you may be.

Take a look at our beautiful range of [Crystal Grid Sets](https://crystalvisions.net.au/collections/crystal-grids) 2. If you can, leave your crystals out overnight and collect them in the morning. Some people also like to let their crystals have some time in the Sunlight and leave their crystals out for 24 hours. Some crystals don't like too much sunlight though, so be careful when doing this. And if it's not safe or possible for you to leave your crystals out all night, that's OK. Just leave them out for a long as possible. [Full Moon Tumbles Set](https://crystalvisions.net.au/products/full-moon-tumbles-set) 3. The Full Moon will also charge the natural properties of the crystals you have. However, it's really important to also charge your crystals with your own intentions. What would you like your crystals to support you in? Maybe there is a goal that you have for the upcoming month? As always, try to focus on a need vs a want when you set your intentions. It can really be anything that you feel you need, that won't bring harm to anyone else. You may like to say these intentions aloud or write them on a piece of paper, do whatever feels right for you. If you would like to take a more in-depth look at how you can set intentions with crystals, you can visit our Blog post on this very topic [here.](https://crystalvisions.net.au/blogs/an-introduction-to-crystal-grids/intention-setting-with-crystals) 4. The final step is to make sure that you give thanks. It's important to express your gratitude to your crystals, the Universal Energy, God, or whatever your higher power may be. Take some time to focus on the things that you are grateful for. Taking the time to cleanse & charge your crystals is a beautiful monthly ritual and an opportunity to really connect with your inner self, connect with the natural world and your crystals.

It's important to note that clouds do not affect the moon's energy. So while it's ideal and, some say, more powerful for your crystals to be in direct moonlight, it's not completely essential. So if it's overcast or raining, you can still cleanse your crystals with the Full Moon's energy. Just make sure that you put out crystals that are OK to come in contact with water. For example, keep [Selenite](https://crystalvisions.net.au/collections/selenite)and Malachite inside because the rain will damage them. Crystals like the [Quartz](https://crystalvisions.net.au/collections/points-and-generators/products/clear-quartz-point)family and most [tumble stones](https://crystalvisions.net.au/collections/tumble-stones)are safe to be outside in the rain. In fact, rain and water will help cleanse them too. Some people even prefer to put their crystals in a plastic see-through container or under glass to protect them while outside. It will depend on your personal circumstances and what you feel comfortable with. [We have an extensive range of tumble stones](https://crystalvisions.net.au/collections/tumble-stones) So collect up your beautiful crystals and give them a cleanse in the beautiful Full Moonlight! The Full Moon is also a powerful time to release or acknowledge anything that no longer serves you. So while it's important to set intentions with the crystals you have been cleansing, you may like to also include a ritual during this potent time to make the most of the Full Moon's energy. You could light a candle, write down some things you are letting go of or want to move on from, and then burn the paper you write it on and return the ashes to the earth. (Makes sure you do this outside or in a fireproof container, safety first!) This practice is powerful, in that it can help to clear away the old, to make room for the new that you are manifesting by setting intentions with your crystals. As always, trust in your own intuition and what feels right for you.
