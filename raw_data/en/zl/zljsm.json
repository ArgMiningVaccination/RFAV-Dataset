MASTER2/MASTER'S REPORTMaster's Report A former Senior Tutor likened my SGM reports to the Path\u00e9 News Reels of the 1950s, in terms of the trumpeting of positive news. This year I have good cause to get the trumpet out of its case and blow it harder than ever. It has been an outstanding year in every respect. Our students and their Tutors have excelled themselves with their performance in Finals this year - 64 Firsts out of the cohort of 130 sitting Finals, including the top First across the University in Law ( Alex Benn, North Halifax Grammar School), in Biology ( Oliver Mattinson, Marlborough College) and in Nathan Geyer , Haberdashers' Aske's, Hatcham College). The Lawyers managed the top First too in Law Moderations (Joshua Wang, Raffles Institution, Singapore) whilst the Biologists took the top Distinction in Prelims (Mavis Teo, NUS High School of Maths and Science, Singapore). The Academic Ofce and our Tutors have much to be proud of in helping our students to realise their potential, but Marc Mulholland deserves very special mention in terms of College citizenship. He has served as Dean, now as Senior Tutor, and throughout has kept his teaching, research and revolutionary interests alive. His new book in respect of the latter is called The Murderer of Warren Street and is sure to be a bestseller. I have already sent him a Gift Aid form. The Development Ofce team led by Saira Uppal has had an outstanding year, having raised just over \u00a33M, with a participation rate of 18%, the fth highest in Oxford. In particular, we are extremely grateful for the very signicant individual gift this year from Simon Clark (1966, Mod Langs and now Honorary Fellow). It's been a great year too in terms of recognition of the achievements of our Fellows: The Master, Professor Roger AinsworthOur students and their Tutors have excelled themselves with their performance in Finals this year.COLLEGE LIFESTUDENT PERSPECTIVES ST CATHERINE'S COLLEGE 2018/3ST CATHERINE'S COLLEGE 2018/3Lord Bragg of Wigton (Domus Fellow) was made Companion of Honour in the 2018 Queen's Birthday Honours, recognising his long-standing services to Broadcasting and the Arts. Melvyn has been a loyal supporter of the College in spite of his very busy life. Laura Tunbridge (Tutorial Fellow in Music) was an invited guest on Melvyn's Radio 4 programme In Our Time to talk about the works of Beethoven, and separately Kirsten Shepherd-Barr (Tutorial Fellow in English) joined a panel of three to talk about Ibsen. Just before the programme went live on air, Melvyn said to Kirsten, \"You know I'm a Fellow of St Catherine's too, don't you?\", at which point the third member of the panel, Norwegian Tore Rem chimed in that he too was a former Fellow of Catz! The internationally acclaimed pioneering work of our Honorary Fellow, Nick Stern, Lord Stern of Brentford, President of the British Academy from 2013 until July 2017, was recognised by the award of an Honorary Degree, the DLitt, at the University's Encaenia this year, always a most glittering occasion. Professor Masaki Orita (Honorary Fellow and Alumnus) has been awarded the Order of the Sacred Treasure, Gold and Silver Star by HM the Emperor of Japan, an honour awarded to those who have made distinguished achievements in civil or military service. Marshall Cloyd (Domus Fellow) has been honoured, receiving the Admiral of the Navy George Dewey Award from the Naval Order of the United States. This he receives for establishing a record of exemplary service whilst acting in a civilian capacity in a senior federal government position. I believe also that Marshall is the only Fellow here to have had an asteroid named after him, 15499 CLOYD, discovered in 1999. You may like to know that it orbits the Sun with a period of 1,902 days. Professor Eleanor Stride (Fellow in Engineering Science) has been elected to a Fellowship of the Royal Academy of Engineering, winning recognition for outstanding engineering accomplishment. Her research using nanobubbles to deliver drugs to cancer tumours continues with great intensity. One of her current strands of work is at the new national Rosalind Franklin Institute based at Harwell, dedicated to bringing about transformative changes in Life Science through interdisciplinary R&D. She is part of the team working on what will be the rst camera in the world able to capture up to 100 million individual frames per second at 1-megapixel resolution operating across a wide optical spectrum from ultraviolet to infrared. The camera will help her to understand the biophysical mechanisms behind drug delivery - critical to perfecting ultrasound targeted drug delivery. Dr Jessica Goodman (Fellow and Tutor in French) was recently awarded a Rising Star Engagement research award by the British Academy for the project 'Modern Languages in Crisis: Creating a Support Network for Languages Outreach in the UK'. The idea behind her project is to train Early Career Researchers to think of using their research to engage school students. Just before the programme went live on air, Melvyn said to Kirsten, \"You know I'm a Fellow of St Catherine's too, don't you?\", at which point the third member of the panel, Norwegian Tore Rem chimed in that he too was a former Fellow of Catz! COLLEGE LIFEJim Thomson (Fellow by Special Election in Chemistry) becomes our new Tutor for Admissions, and has assumed the mantle with great gusto. You will know that Outreach is a set agenda item for Oxford and therefore for St Catherine's. We have of course been working in this area since the foundation of the Delegacy for Unattached Students, 150 years ago. The team led by Jim together with Charlotte Sansome, and supported by our new Outreach Ofcer Anna McMurtie, has welcomed over 1,200 prospective applicants to the College, from more than 85 different school groups. For well over a century, the Leathersellers' Livery Company has been a great supporter of St Catherine's. They have good links with schools in South London and because of this we now have a Leathersellers' Day here, the aim of which is Before I speak more generally about our other Outreach work, I must rst of all thank Byron Byrne, our demitting Tutor for Admissions for his exemplary and skilful efforts over 10 years in our Admissions Ofce. Subsequently hundreds of pupils across the country will be exposed to events that should inspire them to see Modern Languages study in a new light, and hopefully encourage them to study it at both school level and - hopefully - beyond. Before I speak more generally about our other Outreach work, I must rst of all thank Byron Byrne , our demitting Tutor for Admissions for his exemplary and skilful efforts over 10 years in our Admissions Ofce. He has resigned from his Tutorial Fellowship, to become the \u00d8rsted / Royal Academy of Engineering Research Chair in Advanced Geotechnical Design. He has secured \u00a35M of funding from the Danish rm \u00d8rsted, to work on new design methods for offshore wind turbine foundations. We are very pleased to retain him as a Fellow by Special Election. COLLEGE LIFE 4/MASTER'S REPORTST CATHERINE'S COLLEGE 2018/5to inspire pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds who have outstanding academic potential to apply to highly selective universities like Oxford. 50 came this year, from four schools. Our students are very active too in this area, as one might hope and expect, and a good number act as volunteer tutors to local schools through Schools Plus at the Oxford Hub, through Students4Students going to local primary schools to tutor English and Maths, and through Jacari, providing one hour a week of free home tutoring to children who speak English as an additional language. In terms of news of some specic students:Chloe Rooke (2015, Music) was 'highly commended' in the 'Young Star' category of the Women of the Future Awards in November last year, and went on to take part in a prestigious conducting course with the BBC National Orchestra of Wales. She was the only woman on the course and the only undergraduate - the others were postgrads. She is certainly one to watch. Alissa Hummer (2015, Biochemistry) and Zoe Catchpole (2015, Biochemistry) won gold medals at the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition. The iGEM competition attracts 5,600 participants across 42 countries. In March, Sophie Taylor (2013, Medical Sciences) was elected President of Vincent's Club - the rst female president since the club was established in 1863.Catz student Sam Edgerley (2017, Modern Languages) represented the University in the Rugby Varsity Match against Cambridge in December, while Morgan McGovern (2017, Management Studies) rowed in the Oxford vs Cambridge Boat Race this year, described as the power in the centre of the boat - where Catz likes to be. Oxford beat Cambridge in both the Men's and Women's Varsity Triathlon this year, with Sophia Saller (2011, Mathematics) taking 1 st place in the women's competition. Our students won a Platinum award for the Student Switch Off campaign. Let's hope it's to do with electricity. Our alumni are not to be outdone by the rest of the College in registering noteworthy achievements. Two were honoured in the 2018 New Year's Honours list: Joanna Coleman (1986, Engineering), was awarded an OBE for services to the Energy Sector. Currently the Director of Strategy Development for the Energy Technologies Institute, her work there is focused on creating strong partnerships and modelling systems which should have a signicant impact on the advancement of low carbon technology for the energy sector. Professor Mark Miodownik (1988, Metallurgy) was awarded an MBE for his services to Science, Engineering Chloe Rooke (2015, Music) was 'highly commended' in the 'Young Star' category of the Women of the Future Awards in November last year, and went on to take part in a prestigious conducting course ...COLLEGE LIFEand Broadcasting. Recently, in a series of programmes on BBC Radio 4, he explored our love-hate relationship with plastic, why we have ended up with oceans of waste blighting the environment and what science and society can do about it. The Queen's Birthday Honours brought further esteem to the College: Professor Sarah Harper (1979, Anthropology & Geography) was made a CBE for services to the science of Demography. She is this University's rst Professor of Gerontology, and has served on the Prime Minister's Council for Science and Technology since 2014, a body which advises the PM on the scientic evidence for strategic policies and frameworks. Jeanette Winterson (1978, English) was made a CBE for services to Literature. In terms of other notable achievements amongst our alumni, David Waksman QC (1979, Law) has been appointed a Justice of the High Court, with effect from October 2018. He has played a leading role in the training of judges at all levels. David has been involved in the recent development of the Business and Property Court. Rustam Stolkin (1993, Engineering), Chair in Robotics at the University of Birmingham, is the Director of the new National Centre for Nuclear Robotics. He recently won \u00a342 million funding to found the centre, which aims to establish the UK as a leader in applying advanced robotics to nuclear problems. Diplomacy and politics seems to be a career theme for our alumni this year: Andrew Pearce OBE (1979, Chemistry) was recently appointed Governor of Montserrat, his latest posting in his 30 years of service for the UK Foreign & Commonwealth Ofce. Trevor Traina (1990, Visiting Student) has followed in his grandfather's footsteps by becoming US Ambassador to Austria. And Simon Bridges (2004, Law) has been elected Leader of New Zealand's opposition party, the National Party.I want to pay a special tribute to Thelma Holt CBE (Emeritus Fellow), our Cameron Mackintosh Professor of 1998, who has never stopped helping Oxford students since. In the forthcoming year she will be winding down the formal bit of her role here, but she will continue giving students the benet of her expertise on an ad-hoc basis. At the National Theatre with Peter Hall in 1987, she won the Olivier Award for Outstanding Achievement in the Theatre for her international work. She hasn't paused for breath since. Her theatrical successes as producer after leaving the National Theatre include many outstanding Shakespeare productions: The Merchant of Venice with Dustin Hoffman, Hamlet with Alan Rickman in the leading role, I want to pay a special tribute to Thelma Holt CBE (Emeritus Fellow), our Cameron Mackintosh Professor of 1998, who has never stopped helping Oxford students since. 6/MASTER'S REPORTCOLLEGE LIFEST CATHERINE'S COLLEGE 2018/7and Much Ado about Nothing with Janet McTeer and Mark Rylance. Of all her awards, Thelma is most proud of the Order of the Rising Sun from the Emperor of Japan 'for her services to cultural exchange between the UK and Japan, particularly the work of the director Yukio Ninagawa'. We are so fortunate that she has never left us! The new building work in College is well underway. So many well-motivated young people want to come here that we have had to expand the numbers in College. The 19 students in 1868 had grown to 600 in 2001, and to over 1,000 today - now the largest college by over 200. Ashok Handa , our Tutor for Graduates, and his supporting team have played a large part in the growth over the last decade or so. These numbers have provided us with the incentive to build what will possibly be the last range of buildings on our site here - a further 78 graduate en-suite rooms in three staircases and a new Graduate Centre incorporating a new MCR and further seminar rooms. The latter building will be on three floors and circular in form. In the last decade and a half, we will have more than doubled the number of student bedrooms from the original 305 to 649. We are very pleased with the design work carried out, and so far so good with the contractors executing the plans. The journey to this stage has been a complicated one - for instance, archaeologists got excited about the possible presence of a Saxon ditch potentially under the Graduate Centre, the Environment Agency had to be satised over the effect on the flood plain, and Merton College still held covenants over the land we purchased from them many years ago. We are very grateful to James Bennett, our Home Bursar, in the very detailed and extensive work he has to carry out in interfacing with the building project. He carries a very heavy load, much of it unseen by colleagues. In terms of the building project, nancing too of course could not be taken for granted, but the skills of Fram Dinshaw , our Finance Bursar, careful custodian of our nancial strength, enable us to take on this project unaffected by sleepless nights. We are deeply grateful for those skills. For the record, our initial endowment in 1962 was equivalent to \u00a310.8M in today's money. The 2018 value of endowment is \u00a385M. Well, there you have it. A frenetic year marked by great achievements. I am so privileged to have had the role of Master and I thank you for your help and support. I will demit from ofce in December 2019. I hope you will agree that events of this last year have been appropriate cause for wielding the Path\u00e9 News Trumpet.

The Visiting Professorship, based at St Catherine's College, aims to promote interest in, and the study and practice of, contemporary theatre at Oxford. The Visiting Professorship has previously been held by actors, writers, directors, and producers including Arthur Miller, Stephen Fry, Thelma Holt, Stephen Sondheim, Phyllida Lloyd, Sir Tim Rice, Sir Ian McKellen, and Claude-Michel Sch\u00f6nberg. We are thrilled to be welcoming Deborah Warner as the 27 th Cameron Mackintosh Visiting Professor, due to succeed Sir Tom Stoppard in January 2019. Deborah Warner is a world renowned British director of theatre and opera. Her career started in 1980, when she founded the Kick We are delighted announce Deborah Warner CBE as the next Cameron Mackintosh Visiting Professor of Contemporary Theatre for 2019. Theatre Company, which took a play to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival each year. Since then, the majority of Deborah's work has focused on major classics of spoken drama and opera. In 1987 Deborah joined the Royal Shakespeare Company as Resident Director, and from 1989-1997, Deborah was an Associate Director at the National Theatre. Over her career, Deborah has collaborated with actor Fiona Shaw on plays including Electra (1989); King Medea (2000-2001). Many of Deborah's productions have been widely toured, for example her production of T.S Eliot's poem The Waste Land with Fiona Shaw which visited Brussels, Dublin, Paris, Montreal, Toronto, Brighton, Adelaide, Bergen, Perth London, and New York (where it won two New York Drama Desk Awards).Deborah has also worked extensively in the eld of opera and classical music. Examples of her work as a Director include Britten's The Turn of the Screw for the Royal Opera, which won the Evening Standard and South Bank Awards, Dido and Aeneas and La Traviata for the Vienna Festival. She has also directed Wozzeck and La Voix humaine for Opera North and both Don Giovanni and Fidelio for Glyndebourne. Examples of her work for the English National Opera include Britten's Death in Venice and Handel's Messiah . Deborah a CBE in the 2006 Queen's Birthday Honours for services to drama. She has also been awarded the Chevalier dans l'ordre des Artes et des Lettres by the French Government in 1992 and Ofcier dans l'ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 2000. Commenting on the appointment, the Master, Professor Roger Ainsworth, said: \"We are extremely excited to know that Deborah Warner will be arriving as our new Cameron Mackintosh Visiting Professor of Contemporary Theatre in January. Her breadth of stellar directing will be of immense interest to our community, and great help to the student population.\" Deborah Warner added: \"I am delighted and honoured to follow such an illustrious list of chair-holders, and take up the 2019 Cameron Mackintosh Chair of Contemporary Theatre at Oxford. At a moment of such change and uncertainty in Britain and beyond, the nurture and encouragement of future generations of theatre-makers seems more important than ever. I look forward to working closely with the students, offering what benet I may from my experience across the disciplines of theatre, opera and installation. My own involvement in theatre began in Oxford, so it is with particular pleasure I return to this wonderful city and great University.\" Deborah's inaugural lecture will take place during Hilary Term 2019, with further details to be announced closer to the time. Q Deborah Warner's production of Handel's Messiah for the English National Opera in London \u00a9 Tim Regan, Wikimedia CommonsCOLLEGE LIFE 10/SENIOR The 2017-18 was zzing with energy at St Catherine's. On top of the regular classes and tutorials, tutors provided study skills sessions to emphasise that learning, when well directed and planned, has a much greater reach. As Senior Tutor I met with all the Final Years by subject group to discuss the particular challenges and opportunities encountered in the last year of the undergraduate degree. What struck me impressively was the accumulated experience and insight the undergraduates were able to bring to bear. Best of all was their willingness and ability to share tips, hints, and methods one with another. It really reinforced for me the importance of the collegiate system, where individual students are able to learn from each other. This is even more marked, perhaps, in the scholarly discussion groups run by the students themselves. The Dean Kitchin Society, many decades-old, has been resurrected this year by the energy and enthusiasm of undergraduates. They had a particularly interesting joint meeting with the Catz BME Society on education and black liberation. History tutor, Dr Bill Booth, meanwhile, ran a reading-group, open to all students and staff, on C. L. R. James' classic, The Black Jacobins. It will be great to see many more student-led discussion groups springing up. Now part of the regular college academic calendar, and a highlight of the year, is the Catz Exchange Conference. At this event undergraduate and graduate members of the college community join together to present and discuss short academic papers. We had a total of 18 papers presented. Titles included 'Whose Middle Ages? Abuse, alterity, and opportunity', 'Spaghetti Monsters, Uncertainty, and the Ethics of Existential Risk', 'Distancing death: welfare and slaughter in the British halal meat industry', and 'Digitizing the Gothic Cathedral.' These and others came entirely from the students' hard work and imagination. A handsome silver cup was awarded the paper judged (by the Senior Tutor) to have been best constructed and delivered for a wide intellectual audience. The winner was Nick Hu for his paper, 'Using computers to prove mathematics.' The conference ended with a drinks reception and a splendid dinner for all participants in the main hall. Our graduate community remains active and energetic, with doctoral work on a huge range of topic at the cutting edge. Mark Peterzan is researching 'How the heart cars', Robbie Professor Marc Mulholland , the Senior Tutor, provides an overview of the past academic year at St Catherine's.ST CATHERINE'S COLLEGE Louisiana', and Jasmine Proteau, 'Travel and gendered identities in British and North American Women's Guidebooks'. Naturally our staff is research active. Dr Jessica Goodman was awarded the 2018 Women in French Early Career Conference Paper Award for her paper 'Talking Heads: Silenced Female Voices in the Revolutionary Afterlife', while Dr Heidi de Wet's article, 'A Ketone Ester Drink Lowers Human Ghrelin and Appetite' was Editor's Choice in the scholarly journal Obesity. Dr Ashok Handa hosted a symposium entitled 'Talking About Dying'. There were 200 participants and the panel was chaired by Evan Davis. This kind of work, and I could mention much more, ensures that our students are taught by research-active specialists. The students performed brilliantly in Finals in 2018. In undergraduate nals an astonishing 64 candidates were awarded a First, up from 40 last year. We had 58 receive II(i)s, bringing us up to number 3 in the Norrington Table. It has been quite the year. QCOLLEGE LIFE 12/TUTOR FOR ADMISSIONS' REPORTTutor for Admissions' Report It has been an incredibly busy year for admissions and outreach at Catz, not least because there have been several changes in the Admissions Ofce over the last twelve months. First of all, I must pay tribute to my predecessor, Professor Byron Byrne, who did a fantastic job as Tutor for Admissions for over nine years before he passed the baton to me in Michaelmas Term. Following the departure of Charli Hopkins, Charlotte Sansome took up the role of Deputy Academic Registrar (Admissions & Access) and Laurel Quinn was appointed as our Academic Ofcer (Admissions). I am also delighted to announce that Anna McMurtrie has recently joined the team as our Outreach Ofcer, in a new post that was created this year to increase the scope of our outreach work. As always, the admissions exercise in December was a huge operation. This year we received 868 applications (compared to 837 applications in 2016 and 794 applications in 2015), 371 candidates were invited for interview, and over 1000 interviews Dr Jim Thomson , Tutor for Admissions, provides an overview on the work of the Admissions Office over the past academic year. were conducted in College. Despite a heavy snow fall, the interview period went relatively smoothly, thanks in large part to the essential help from our team of 26 student ambassadors. Some of our current undergraduates also played a key role in the Open Days, which took place on 27 and 28 June and 14 September, and I have received several letters of thanks from visitors describing how cheerful and helpful all our student ambassadors were. Shortly before the June Open Days we were excited to take delivery of the rst print run of our updated undergraduate prospectus (now available to download from the College website), which has undergone a complete redesign. This has also been a very successful year for access and outreach at Catz. We have managed to link with a number of new schools and have received overwhelmingly positive feedback from our outreach events. We have engaged with over 1150 students from 85 different schools following a range of different activities, including the Women in Science Day, the Spanish and Portuguese Taster Day, and many school visits for pupils aged between 9-17 years old. In March, we hosted the second Leathersellers' Day as part of the continued relationship that exists between the College and the Leathersellers' Company. The Leathersellers' Day involved 50 students in Year 10 and Year 12 from four different schools across London. In addition to a tour of the College, the students were given a talk about going to University and the Oxford admissions process, had a Q&A session with current students, and participated in a subject taster session in one of seven different subjects split between the sciences and the arts. In June, we hosted 70 students and 26 teachers from 23 schools across Northern Ireland as part of our fourth annual residential summer school, in collaboration with New College. The students were given the opportunity to experience life as an Oxford student, staying in College accommodation, eating meals in hall, and attending tutorials. There was also a full programme of events for the teachers, including a Q&A session with tutors. In January 2017, the central university Student Recruitment Team became ofcially responsible for managing outbound outreach ST CATHERINE'S COLLEGE 2018/ 13COLLEGE LIFE activity in Northern Ireland, bringing the region in line with Scotland in terms of the management of outreach in the area. Despite this change, we are committed to running the residential summer school on an annual basis, and in March the Deputy Academic Registrar attended the Oxbridge Student Conference in Lisburn, Northern Ireland, to reassure our school contacts about our commitment to the region and to assist the Student Recruitment Team during the transition. The College is also involved with outreach at the university level, having recently pledged support for Target Oxbridge, a collaborative outreach programme aimed at UK students of African and Caribbean heritage, and the expansion of the UNIQ summer school, the University of Oxford's flagship outreach programme that supports pupils from under-privileged backgrounds. With the appointment of our new Outreach Ofcer, we are looking to re-shape our outreach strategy over the coming year and signicantly expand the scope of our access work. We will be looking for new opportunities to engage with schools and would gratefully receive donations from alumni and friends of the College to help fund further access initiatives. I would like to thank the Academic Registrar, Cressida Chappell, and Professor Byron Byrne for all their help and support this year throughout what has been quite a steep learning curve for me. I am also very grateful to all my colleagues in the Admissions Ofce for their hard work, dedication and unwavering commitment to admissions and outreach at Catz. Looking ahead to the next academic year, we are excited about the launch of our new website and are braced for a bumper year of applications following our recent success, achieving third position, in the Norrington Table rankings.

This year has been a record year for graduate students at St Catz with a total of 442 graduates, made up of 252 undertaking taught courses and 190 research students. These included 33 undertaking an MBA, 7 an Executive MBA, 28 clinical medics and 16 studying a Masters in Public Policy. We welcomed 256 graduate freshers in Michaelmas 2017, made up of 80 different nationalities from 58 countries, making ours the most international graduate community in Oxford. One of the most pleasurable responsibilities each year is to chair the Graduate Scholarship panels. I am most grateful to the Fellows for their time and diligence in shortlisting and interviewing the applicants. This year we have a total of 69 Graduate scholars at Catz, made up of eight Light Senior scholars, four Leathersellers' scholars, ten named scholarships, nine other College or overseas Professor Ashok Handa , the Tutor for Graduates, provides an overview of the past academic year for the graduate community at St Catherine's. scholars and 13 Foundation scholars. These Foundation Scholarships are awarded to alumni of ours who gained a rst-class degree and are staying on for graduate studies. Chairing the Graduate Scholarship panels is a most humbling process as there are many more deserving and excellent applicants each year that we are unfortunately unable to award scholarships to. I shall continue to work with the Director of Development to increase the total number of scholarships available to our graduate students. We also welcomed four graduates awarded an Oxford-based scholarship targeted at St Catherine's and a further 21 Oxford-based scholars including ve Rhodes scholars, two Commonwealth scholars, one Clarendon scholar and six Chevening scholars. We have a lively and active MCR with a varied programme of social and academic events each year, including the popular MCR Guest Night every Friday in term time. I am grateful to the MCR committee for all their hard work in keeping the academic and social programmes going throughout the year and in particular making the graduate freshers feel so welcome at the start of the year. This year has also seen the College invest in our graduate community by beginning the construction of 72 new en-suite rooms for graduate students onsite, and a new Graduate Centre building to house a larger MCR. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Academic Registrar and her team. who provide me with such excellent support in all the administrative tasks needed for admissions, reviewing of reports and the Scholarship panels, with calm efciency and good humour. It is an exciting time for graduates at St Catherine's and the future looks bright! Q ST CATHERINE'S COLLEGE 2018/15COLLEGE LIFE Visiting Students Report Naomi Freud, our Director of Studies for Registered Visiting Students provides an overview of the Visiting Student Programme at Catz. I am very proud to direct the Registered Visiting Student Programme at Catz. I write this as I look forward to a new year of fresh faces, inspiring talent, humour, and kindness personied. Each year we welcome around 80 visiting students who join us for a year, two terms or one term. There are 50 students at any one time. Some take courses alongside their matriculated college peers and others enjoy bespoke tutorials enabling them to explore subjects new to all of us. Hostile Architecture is one that springs to mind and a new one for this year. It comes as my challenge from Columbia University. What I admire are the ways in which many of the students fully incorporate themselves into the busy life of college. I enjoy seeing and listening to the collaborations between our matriculated and visiting students on musical and dramatic endeavours. It is great to learn how many of them set up companies and work together after they graduate from university. There is a real dynamism that is infectious. The continuity of their relationship with Catz lives on after they leave and I know that many have made life-long friends here and have affectionate memories of their time at Catz. Let me share part of a reflection on Oxford sent to me by a former visiting student who joined us last year. Myles Zhang writes: 'My future has been shaped by the Oxford experience, which often included twelve 2000-word essays and thousands of pages reading per term. The year-long rigorous academic programme endows me with an \"Oxford state of mind,\" dened by the tutorial process - asking questions, seeking answers through reading and self-reflection, and contemplating conclusions with the tutor. My demanding professors always pushed me beyond Oxford's medieval castles into the real world, in the present and past. With Oxford's tutorial system, I enjoyed freedom unavailable in any \"traditional\" universities and marvelled at the Bodleian and over 100 libraries, as well as dozens of college chapels. My little red bicycle took me to surrounding canals, meadows, and even cemeteries, where J.R.R. Tolkien, Isaiah Berlin, and James Legge rest. Wheels hitting cobblestones during my nightly ride left a comfort ing sound in my memories. My new friends accommodated me in their homes in Bournemouth and Southern Bavaria. Most of all, I even had the great fortune to nd someone to share my life with. Without a doubt, I will treasure this gift through my academic and life journey.' The academic calibre of our visitors has been tremendous and is matched by their humility and appreciation for those who teach them. This last year I was touched by the comments the students gave on their tutorial report forms and in our end of term individual meetings. The feedback forms richly demonstrate the wealth of goodwill, inspiration, dedication, passion, flair, kindness and commitment, and expertise recognised by our visiting students in their tutors. QCOLLEGE LIFE 16/FROM THE LIBRARYFrom the Library The College Library has recently received an exceptional bequest of books from Professor George Holmes. Having taught for the St Catherine's Society in the 1950s, George Holmes became a Founding Fellow of the College and Tutor in Medieval History. He also served for many years as Fellow Librarian, playing a signicant role in building up the Library from modest beginnings. The St Catherine's Society had had the use of a library which chiefly comprised donations in the elds of theology and classics, two elds of prevailing interest to earlier generations but neither of which subjects, ironically, was offered in the new, and self-consciously modern, foundation of St Catherine's College from 1962. A man of wide culture and intellectual interests, George worked with the Assistant Librarians and with academic colleagues to establish solid foundations in the Library's holdings across all of the subjects now being studied in St Catherine's. That the collection, now comprising 60,000 volumes, is currently one of the best undergraduate libraries in Oxford is due not least to George's contribution. Professor Gervase Rosser , Fellow Librarian and Fellow in History of Art, writes about the past academic year for the College Library. George's teaching and research extended from the social and economic history of England in the later Middle Ages to medieval and Renaissance Italy. His particular achievement, both in his published scholarship and in the courses which he taught to undergraduates, lay in his distinctive combination of a grounded sense of the fundamental signicance of economic relationships in history with a determination to show how cultural forms might be comprehended in a holistic understanding of the past. The visual arts, in particular, were important to him, and at a time when the Oxford History Faculty remained suspicious of the flighty and decadent connotations of the history of art, George was one of a tiny handful of tutors who included the critical analysis of images as a signicant part of the historical enterprise. By doing so, he helped to make possible the eventual creation, in 2004, of the new BA degree course in Art History, in which St Catherine's participated from the outset. George had left St Catherine's in 1989 to take up the Chichele Professorship of Medieval History at All Souls' College. But both he and his wife, Anne Holmes, a Fellow of Hertford College and tutor in French literature, remained attached to St Catherine's. George died in 2008, and Anne in 2017, after which their three children conrmed their parents' desire that their books should benet the community, and especially the undergraduates, of St Catherine's. After the Assistant Librarians, Luda Gromova and Barbara Costa, had sorted the library, more than 1,000 valuable additions were made, principally in the disciplines of History, Literature and the History of Art. The presence of George and Anne Holmes will thus continue to be felt in the intellectual life of the College. Q ST CATHERINE'S COLLEGE 2018/ 17COLLEGE LIFE From the Archive Barbara Costa, Assistant Librarian and College Archivist, writes about the past academic year for the College Archives. Music House since the 1980s were converted into digital les The activity of the Archive is encouraged periodically by internal and external enquiries. The internal enquiries regard mainly the provision of photographs and documents to the Development or the Master's Of ces, which organise events with alumni or sponsors of the College. The external enquiries last year concerned the College architects, family history and evidence of alumni who have become prominent in various elds. Such requests for information stimulate the exploration and promotion of different sections of the Archive and the nding of hidden gems, such as the records of College societies since the beginning of the twentieth century. One of these is the History Society, established in 1900 and rechristened the Dean Kitchin Society after the rst sole censor of the Delegacy, the Rev. G.W. Kitchin. In the preliminary meeting minutes, dated 15 March Despite its modern foundation, St. Catherine's has an important Archive, with records dating back to 1868, when it was a Delegacy of Non-Collegiate Students established to broaden access to the University of Oxford. The late Derek Davies, Fellow in Law, and Margaret Davies looked after the Archive for a number of years. Since 2011, the Assistant Librarian has also taken on the role of College Archivist, and as the current Archivist I have been building on previous work and exploring ways to develop the Archive for the future. During the past year, the Archive has maintained its role of preserving records of the life of the College. A small number of these are related to the Delegacy, and a larger number to the foundation and subsequent life of the College, in addition to administrative records. They include a variety of media, primarily paper records, but also videos and audiocassettes, photographs, paintings, and memorabilia. The videos and audiocassettes are currently in the process of digitisation due to their vulnerability, and last year audiocassettes of concerts held in the 1900, the society stated as its main goal: 'that papers be read weekly for not more than six weeks in each term by members of the Society, each paper to be followed by discussion. That such papers be con ned to the subjects contained in the syllabus of the Honour school of Modern History...' The Society, which has fl uctuated in the intensity of its activities over the ensuing century, remains today a vibrant space for debate on historical issues. This year will be the College's 150th anniversary, and the Archive will contribute with an exhibition, provisionally planned to be held in the autumn of 2019 in the Library, of some signi cant records depicting the history of the College. QCOLLEGE LIFE 18/THE DEVELOPMENT OFFICE REVIEWThe Development Office The Development Ofce exists to maintain and strengthen our relationship with our 10,000 strong Catz community of alumni, friends and parents, who are based in over 127 countries. We are very fortunate that our international community comes from a wide range of backgrounds, spans several generations, and works in many different professions. Each year, we welcome back over 700 people to events and send out over 18,000 publications. Lifelong Catz Community The day you matriculate, you become a lifelong member of our Catz community and in the Development Ofce we ensure that the benets of this membership continue once you leave. Our events calendar continues to grow in number and variety, offering our alumni, friends and parents an opportunity to meet with old friends and make new connections, whilst keeping up to date with College news. It is always a pleasure to meet the new members of our community at the Parents' and Freshers' Lunch held at the end of Hilary Term. This is always a joyous event with a drinks reception in the JCR followed by lunch with the Master in Hall. The Master also hosts a garden party for second years and their parents to celebrate the end of Trinity Term. This year, even with the traditionally English weather, the beautiful setting of the Water Gardens and strawberries and cream were enjoyed by all. We welcomed over 300 alumni back to College for the Gaudy for 2003 - 2012 matriculands, who enjoyed dinner in Hall followed by drinks in the JCR bar. We were delighted to hold our inaugural Medics' Gaudy last year, which brought together alumni and current students from a wide range of matriculation years - from 1957 to 2016! Away from College, our London Party was held at The British Academy and was as popular as ever with almost 200 alumni attending, uniting an even greater span of matriculation years. As our Catz community is spread across the world, it is important that we enable our alumni, friends and parents to come together locally too. We would like to express our gratitude to Gerald and Marion McGovern, parents of Morgan McGovern (2017, Management Studies) and to Anne Bevis Detwiler (m. 1988), for their support in helping us to achieve this in North America. Gerald and Marion were the gracious hosts of our rst San Francisco Drinks Reception and Anne opened her home in New York for a drinks reception on the East Coast. We appreciate not all of our alumni can make it to events, and we hope you enjoy staying in touch through our publications: CatzEye and The Year. To ensure you are kept up-to-date with our news, it would be much appreciated if you could provide us with your contact details. You can do so through this website: www.stcatz.ox.ac.uk/alumni-friends/your-details/ Thank You We're delighted to announce that last nancial year nearly 2,000 members of our community made a gift to College, donating over \u00a33 million between them. This is an incredible result for St Catz, and we would like to express our heartfelt thanks to everyone who donated. Philanthropic support has played a vital role in the College's development over the last 150 years, and we are incredibly grateful that it continues to allow the College to flourish today. Year on year, more of our community choose to make a donation to the College, and last year was no exception. We're particularly grateful to all those who rose to the challenge The Year in ReviewST CATHERINE'S COLLEGE 2018/ 19COLLEGE LIFE So far, nearly \u00a36m has been raised towards the Graduate Centre, and building started over the summer. We plan to open the centre at the start of our next academic year. 150th Anniversary We're excited to be celebrating the College's 150 th anniversary throughout the academic year 2018-19, in recognition of our earliest origins as the 'Delegacy for Unattached Students'. St Catherine's traces its descent Scholares Non Ascripti, or 'Delegacy for Unattached Students', established in 1868. The Delegacy was established as part of an expansion of the University so that students would be able to gain an Oxford education without the costs of College membership. We will be marking this momentous occasion with a vibrant events programme, culminating in an Anniversary Weekend on 14-15 September 2019. We hope that these events will serve as a perfect opportunity for our community of alumni, students, parents and friends to join in celebration. The full list of events features on page 54. Thanks again, we hope to see you this year. Q which was set by a generous Catz Couple in honour of our 150th anniversary. They offered to contribute \u00a3150 for every gift made in July, and donate a further \u00a315,000 if 200 of our alumni made a gift! It was humbling to see so many coming together and showing their support. This challenge alone raised \u00a378,000, which contributed to our \u00a33 million total; we would like to thank everyone who made this possible, especially the Catz couple, who wish to remain anonymous. Our annual Telethon was well received once again, with 14 of our current students talking to over 500 of you around the world and raising more than \u00a3200,000 in the process. Not only does the telethon raise funds for the College, but it is also an excellent opportunity for our students to speak to our alumni, compare College life experiences and have conrmation that there is life beyond Catz! We look forward to building on these results throughout our 150 th Anniversary year.Building for the futureWe are utilising the remaining space we have available on College land to build a new Graduate Centre, housing an MCR, seminar rooms and several versatile academic and social spaces. In addition, we are also building three new staircases alongside staircase 23, to complete the work which was rst started in June. Although we house around 90% of our undergraduates for the entirety of their course, we are facing rising pressure to offer similar levels of accommoda tion for our graduates. These new staircases, earmarked especially for our graduates, will enable us to protect them from the difculties of 'living out' and remain competitive in the growing contest for exceptional talent. The buildings will ensure that our remarkable learning environment, which is at the heart of the Catz Community and for which we are famed, will continue to thrive in the future. COLLEGE LIFE 20/POSTCARDS TO THE MASTEREvery year College Travel Awards are granted to students who plan, organise and undertake expeditions around the globe. Whether undertaking charitable work or ful lling lifelong ambitions to visit other cultures, all the students who take part nd their horizons broadened and their educational experience enriched. This year over 50 Travel Awards were granted. Here are four of the many postcards the Master received.Postcards to the Master ST CATHERINE'S COLLEGE 2018/ 21COLLEGE LIFE COLLEGE LIFE 22/JCR REPORTJCR Report 2017-2018 was an exciting year for college life at Catz. This next section will take you through the highlights of the Junior Common Room member activities, events, and campaigns in the past academic year. Catz JCR members have been particularly engaged in university level drama, arts and music this year. Catz students produced and directed Travesties at the Oxford Playhouse after being inspired by Tom Stoppard's lectures as the visiting Cameron Mackintosh professor. Alongside this, many individual JCR members have been cast in and starred in plays across the university - including in Lights Over Tesco Car Park which is making its debut in London in the coming months at the Pleasance Theatre. Our musicians can also be found performing in university ensembles such as OUJO and the Alternotives, and Catz's very own band Still Pigeon has been performing in venues around Oxford to massive success. They will also be taking their craft to London in the coming months - watch out Arctic Monkeys! We have numerous Tiger Hills (2016, Geography) , the 2017-18 JCR President, shares some of the highlights of the past academic year in the Junior Common Room. students involved in writing for and editing publications such as Cherwell and The Isis - two of this year's editors were Catz JCR members. Closer to home, Catz choir sang to a packed out Harris Manchester chapel at the Christmas Carol Service, and have performed at JCR music nights throughout the year. In general, Catz arts has been thriving with a re-engagement in JCR music nights, regular arts and crafts themed picnics, and an entire Artz week dedicated to putting Catz at the forefront of the university scene - and to a particularly chilly outdoor cinema experience! Throughout the year, the JCR committee have run events to promote inclusivity and positive engagement in college life. These range from weekly 'Munches' - themed free Sunday afternoon snacks - to talks given by external speakers, all the way to hosting International- and Pride-themed Entz. During our Artz week, Catz's spectacular architecture played host to a BME art exhibition which took over the walls of the JCR alongside other key college spaces, and the iconic shbowl buildings were engulfed by an interpretive sound installation. Catz charities, Emilie's Charities and Books2Africa, remain well supported with the JCR raising just over \u00a31,200 for them across the year. Money was raised through several events - including our very own version of Take Me Out - and Catz students had the opportunity to see where their money was going by meeting Dr Tonson Sango from Books2Africa when he visited us. Alongside this, the JCR raised money through our weekly pub quiz, lm nights, a charity cookbook and calendar, and a charity polo tournament. There was a particular emphasis on environmental work this year, with successful campaigns to ban plastic straws from the bar, remove paper towels from Old Quad bathrooms, and promote recycling on campus. The JCR was a particularly lively space with plenty to celebrate - Catz won the overall Cuppers championship for all sports, with title wins in Ultimate Frisbee, Pool, Rugby and Rounders, and close seconds in many ST CATHERINE'S COLLEGE 2018/ 23COLLEGE LIFE others. This makes Catz the best college in Oxford for sports, and has - after coming third on the Norrington Table - possibly the most well-rounded students at the university (who says you can't do both)! Clubs and Socs have bloomed at Catz in the past year, with new societies sprouting incessantly - pottery, life drawing and lacrosse are now among some of the best attended societies at Catz. JCR campaigns were equally successful with highlights being the introduction of a new JCR committee member to represent minorities, the free provision of condoms and sanitary products, and the introduction of a new college counsellor. Alongside this, a particularly strong JCR campaign has started and is continuing to push for divestment of St Catherine's fossil fuel investments alongside a continued project to host new portraits of influential women in the college library. Finally, Catz will be transformed in February 2019 as we host a night to remember in celebration of 150 years since our founding. Watch this space!

From discovering potentially new antibiotics by sequencing the genome of bacteria to rowing for the Oxford blues team, Catz graduates have consistently excelled in both academia and sports. So incredible are our members, that the Friday MCR Guest Dinners often felt like a utopian dream: incredibly intelligent people of different backgrounds engaging in kind and thoughtful conversations on all sorts of topics. A sight of relief in a world that is ever more divided. The dream-like atmosphere of the MCR, however, did not distract our members from the realities of the world. This last year, Catz MCR members founded new social enterprises, led international summits and created new businesses. In the process, they helped ease the world's social burdens and elevate the wellbeing of many. In fact, this year, perhaps more than others, we took time to think about our responsibility beyond the prodigious modernist campus of Arne Jacobsen. Why so?Eduardo Chazan (2017, Management Studies), the 2017-18 MCR Co-President, reflects on the past academic year for the Middle Common Room. The Delegacy for Unattached Students was founded on the 11 June 1868. On that day, 150 years ago, the dream of St Catz was born. The Delegacy's mission, as stated by George Kitchin, was to guarantee a University where \"the best education [would be] placed within the reach of all\". Its anniversary reminds us that Catz exists to bring positive change to Oxford and beyond. It cautions us not to allow our education and research to be limited to the College grounds. Together with our motto, Nova et Vetera, our Delegacy's roots emphasise that we must challenge and update conventions; the MCR is central in this mission. In 1884, Herbert Hensley Henson became the rst Delegacy alumnus to be elected, straight from his First-Class degree, as a Fellow of All Souls. In doing so, he also became some sort of proto-Catz MCR member. His election as a Fellow meant he had received both superb undergraduate and graduate education in the Delegacy - at least from our current understanding of what superior education is. Quite ttingly, he became famous for campaigning for a more humane and dignied society. Henson fought against the exploitation of foreign workers by British companies and oppressive religious laws, and he also publicly denounced Fascism and Nazism before it was common to do so. This spirit, of the necessity to bring positive change, is the essence of our MCR. Every year hundreds of students join our common room. They come from more than 50 different countries and countless backgrounds. Also, every year, hundreds leave our common room, empowered by the knowledge and experience acquired in Oxford. They adventure back to the world, fullling our mission of challenging conventions and bringing the change that is necessary to countless communities. This is how the MCR fulls its mission, and how the dream of Catz continues to flourish. QST CATHERINE'S Dalal Phil Social Yossi Manager Supratik Ofcer Johnny Goslar Women's Welfare Ofcer Jasmin Tarique 26/SPORTS AND SOCIETIES REVIEWCOLLEGE LIFE Sports and Societies Review Clubs and Societies at Catz have had a fantastic year, with more students than ever taking part in all sorts of activities at both a college and a university level. 2017-18 saw Catz sport go from strength to strength, with lots of students playing for University teams in sports ranging from rugby to trampolining, as well as playing for our many Catz teams. Following successes across a range of sports, Catz won Cuppers overall, which is a massive achievement. We won athletics, equestrian, Eton ves, handball, netball, polo and pool, and also did really well in triathlon, Ultimate Frisbee and American Football. These results reflect the huge variety of sports which Catz students play to a high level across the University. One of the highlights of this year has been the success of Mixed Lacrosse, captained by Sian Mathur (2017, Experimental Psychology) and Phoebe Whitehead (2017, Human Sciences). Enthusiasm for lacrosse has been enormous, with over 30 people Meirian Evans (2017, Medical Sciences), the JCR Clubs and Societies Representative, shares some of the highlights of the College's thriving culture of extra-curricular activities from the past year. now playing each week. They are now hoping to nd glory in next year's Cuppers. The ve football teams have also had a really good year. Ruth Faherty (2016, Engineering Science) captained the Women's team to the semi-nals in Cuppers, and they also came fourth in the league's top division, which made them the best undergraduate college team. The Men's 1 st XI also reached the semi- nals of Cuppers, and they came second in the league. Catz Rugby, captained by Alex Maguire (2016, History) won division one for the rst time in history in Michaelmas, scoring by far the most and conceding the fewest points. Injuries prevented a successful title defence in Hilary, but the team avoided relegation and are in a good position to try to reconquer division one next term. Catz basketball crushed the college league played over Michaelmas and Hilary, only losing one game in the process. Unfortunately, in Trinity they were then rewarded by being seeded against the Cuppers nalists of last year. Due to some underhand play and suspiciously quick games, they were narrowly knocked out in the Cuppers group stages. We put up a fantastic performance in the more minor college sports this year. The Catz rounders team stormed to victory in Cuppers this year, winning against Univ, Teddy Hall and Christ Church. Ultimate Frisbee has also done really well this year, winning their league after a tense nal against Worcester. 2018 also saw a Catz against Catz pool Cuppers nal, held in the JCR, with hugely enthusiastic support and live online coverage. The women's side of the Boat Club has gone from success to success this year, and has almost doubled in size. W1 did really well in Torpids, bumping twice on the two days of racing, and would have done even better had the other days not been cancelled due to the snow. In Summer Eights, they had a tougher week, rowing over for the rst three days, but they managed to bump Trinity on the nal day. W2 had a stellar week at Eights, bumping ST CATHERINE'S COLLEGE 2018/ 27COLLEGE LIFE four times to go up a division. The four Men's teams also fought hard, with M3 bumping up a remarkable eight places over the week to win blades, and with the other teams managing to stay in their divisions. Congratulations to Ruth Faherty (2016, Engineering Science) who won Catz Sports Personality of the Year for being a fantastic captain of Women's football this year. Arts Personalities of the year were won by the Arts Reps Cat Cooper (2016, Geography) and Danny Cummings (2016, Music) for pulling off a fantastic Arts week this year, which saw music and comedy nights as well as a BME art exhibition and an outdoor lm screening.Thank you so much to everyone who has been involved in such an amazing and successful year for Clubs and Societies at Catz this year!

of the Catz community. Nick Hu (2015, Computer Science), winner of this year's 'best speaker' prize, shares his experience of the event. CatzExchange is an annual conference, chaired by the Senior Tutor, for students of St Catherine's College to present their work and engage in academic discourse. As it spans across all subjects offered by the college, which itself is very balanced between the arts and the sciences, it is certainly an opportunity to bridge enormous gaps between the wide range of interests of the students. Four sessions were offered: attitude, vision, people, and space, drawing on rather philosophical themes. For my talk, in the 'space' session, I presented 'Using computers to prove mathematics'; I talked about what it means to 'prove' logical statements, the differences between deduction and induction, and how mathematics is fundamentally distinct from science. For instance, that which is scienti c is falsi able and backed up by evidence; mathematicians need no such thing - as long as each step in reasoning can be justi ed according to a rather small set of rules, any derivable CatzExchange 2018 conclusion is in fact sound. In essence, the theorems of Euclid, proved over 2,000 years ago, are just as valid today as they were then. Science can be refuted, but mathematical proof stands tall and infallible. But one of the greatest discoveries of the previous century was that this sort of reasoning can be performed by machines. I talked at length about how this connection was not clear to either mathematicians nor computer scientists, both of whom like to work along their lines of academic tradition, but really there is a mostly unexploited trove of discovery to be made along the boundary between the two subjects. My research primarily lies in this boundary: Category Theory is abstract mathematics to some, and theoretical computer science to others, but really it has many faces that surface in all scienti c disciplines, and even beyond to philosophy and linguistics. I was thrilled to be awarded the prize for best speaker, which came in the form of an engraved CatzExchange Tankard, and soon after everyone was whisked away to the dining hall to enjoy an extravagant meal over wine and scholarly discussion of the day's topics. If it were not for CatzExchange, then surely I would have taken for granted the vast array of research done by colleagues who live not 500 metres away from me - for me, it was eye -opening to see what it looked like to be an academic in the eld of History, or how a Geography research proposal is carried out. It can only be a good thing that students have opportunities like this to get excited about and present something they have a personal stake in, and there is no better way to draw on As it spans across all subjects offered by the college, which itself is very balanced between the arts and the sciences, it is certainly an opportunity to bridge enormous gaps between the wide range of interests of the students.STUDENT PERSPECTIVESthe intellectual curiosity that we students have in common. All in all, it was a very enjoyable day full of interesting talks - the kind of which makes one feel very fortunate to attend a university like Oxford. Q STUDENT PERSPECTIVES ST CATHERINE'S COLLEGE 2018/ 35 36/MATTEO BROKETASTUDENT PERSPECTIVES through a combination of bushwhacking and unmarked cattle trails, and complete the entirety of the Huella Andina without any detours or assistance by motor vehicle, for a total distance of 950km and net elevation gain of 27km. For 22 days I walked from 8am to 8pm, averaging a marathon per day, and took in the great diversity of natural and cultural wonders a wintry Patagonia has to offer. After a total of 38 hours of travel to reach my starting point from London, I arrived in a small town at 10pm in virtual pitch-black darkness. I hurried away from the bus stop and into the nearby wooded area to hastily pitch my tent and rest after my long and bumpy journey. Matteo Broketa (2016, Biomedical Sciences) was the winner of the 2018 Wallace Watson Award. Here, he shares his experience trekking 950 kilometres of the Huella Andina trails entirely by foot. The Huella Andina is a collection of trails that span over 600 kilometres of Patagonia from North to South, highlighting several national parks and indigenous Mapuche reservations along the way. However, the trail requires several detours between segments via car or bus, due to a lack of constructed trails or dif cult terrain, which in total amounted to about 350km. My goal was to traverse these off-trail segments on foot Matteo Broketa Tracing the Huella Andina by foot The Huella Andina is a collection of trails that span over 600 kilometres of Patagonia from North to South ...STUDENT PERSPECTIVES ST CATHERINE'S COLLEGE 2018/ 37 However, I did not receive the luxury of sleep that rst night as I had yet to meet the welcoming party that Patagonia had prepared for me. At midnight, a chorus of wild dogs began barking and howling, inviting local house dogs to do the same and this symphony carried on for an hour. Then, around 2:30am, I was greeted by the fl ashlights and footsteps of several police of cers who had been patrolling the area and happily answered their questions about my plans until 3am; I was met by an encouraging round of laughter and then bid good night. Finally, at 4:30am the temperature fell to -10C and a steady snowfall began, leaving me with a centimetre of snow to nish off the night and dampen my tent. My rst night in Patagonia truly made me realise just what I had got myself into. STUDENT PERSPECTIVES When the sun arrived to bring an end to that most interesting of nights, I caught my rst glimpse of the terrain I would be traversing for the next week or so. Due to the rain shadow of the Andes, the area was quite arid in its appearance, in terms of both the plant life and the geography. I had naively expected to see a more Alpine landscape, but would liken the terrain far more to the American Rocky Mountains; rocky ground, thorny bushes and trees, and herds of wild horses would become my companions for the rst half of this trek. Taking my rst steps, I set off with the seemingly simple directive to head south as quickly and safely as possible. I was slightly overzealous and walked a total of 66km that rst day, a record not to be beaten for 38/MATTEO BROKETA ST CATHERINE'S COLLEGE 2018/ 39 STUDENT PERSPECTIVES The Wallace Watson Award encourages students to undertake expeditions or travel of a challenging nature, by providing nancial assistance. The objective of the initiative is to foster an inner strength of character, an appreciation of other cultures and a broadening of the mind, through helping to ensure opportunities for St Catz students to travel the world.The days passed and kilometres fl ew by, each bringing me a new valley or lake to walk the length o f. After 600km, there began a noticeable transition towards a more temperate and water abundant landscape. Everything became considerably more leafy and the mountains more pointed and jagged, a welcome change in scenery. However, this was accompanied by four days of continuous rain, and a rather dangerous close call when I discovered a leak in my tent had soaked my sleeping bag and clothes at 3am. Without further incident, the last several days brought me through the more classic vistas of Patagonia, with jagged snow-capped peaks on either side funnelling me towards the nish line of Lago Baguilt. After 950km I found myself with a deep sense of accomplishment I had never come close to before and will cherish the endless memories of this land and its people forever. I would like to express my sincerest thanks to the Watson family for giving me the chance to undertake this challenge. I look forward to seeing what adventures the Wallace Watson Award makes possible for students of St. Catherine's in the future. Qthe remainder of the trek. While the general features of the terrain remained the same, e very day I was greeted by completely new sights and geography that made passing the many kilometres all the easier. After 180km I reached the rst unof cial 'self-navigated' portion of the trek and was pleasantly surprised to nd a faint trail likely used by gauchos to move cattle between valleys that took me the majority of the distance. As I would nd for the remainder of the trip, this is without a doubt gaucho country and everywhere I went, no matter how far from roads or cities, there was always a small sign to lead the way; a broken fence, vague path through tall grass, or rope left behind, all reassured me that this land was still open to those who are willing to explore....every day I was greeted by completely new sights and geography that made passing the many kilometres all the easier. STUDENT PERSPECTIVES 40/GWENDOLEN VON EINSIEDEL Gwendolen von Einsiedel (2017, Music) shares her experience working with the Pratt Museum in Alaska this summer, generously supported by the Chamberlain Internship Award. The small shing town of Homer, or 'The End of the Road' as it is also known, is appr oximately 200 miles south of Anchorage. The four hour drive down the Sterling Highway takes you around the Turnagain Arm (named when Captain Cook had to turn again in his search for the Northwest Passage), winds you through the epic Chugach mountains and then skirts the Cook Inlet all the way down to the southern tip of the Kenai Peninsula. It's here the road really does end and sea and mountains roll on endlessly before your eyes. Like anywhere else in Alaska, Homer sits on the edge of vast wilderness and is a critical habitat area for many species of marine and mammal life. It's entirely routine to see gargantuan moose sauntering across roads, bald eagles chattering in trees or fat otters hanging out in the harbour. I was in Alaska over the summer to intern on a project with the Pratt Museum. The Pratt prides itself as the only Gwendolen von Einsiedel Tales from the End of the Road: An Alaskan Summerinterdisciplinary museum in the 25,600 sq mi area of the Kenai Peninsula with a mission to strengthen relationships between 'people and place' through the stories of Kachemak Bay. They were undertaking a two-and-a-half- year outreach project exploring traditional values through foodways and musical traditions across seven different communities in the area . These communities included the Native Alutiiq villages of Port Graham and Nanwalek, the Russian Old Believers in the village of Nikolaevsk and the town of Homer. The project would culminate in a book of food recipes, accompanying music re cordings and interviews. Having already worked on community music projects in Homer in previous years I had a good perspective on the eclectic music scene. I was put to use interviewing key musicians with the aim of exploring if any discernable link could be drawn between the music being played and the surrounding environment. For a remote shing town, the abundance and variety of live music is remarkable. In venues ranging from smoky dive bars, to potlucks in barns, you can nd bluegrass, classical, reggae and even marimba groups. Anything goes in Homer, as local ddler Jen King explained: 'Homer has slowly been settled by people who have an af nity with the arts'. We were standing at Jen's stall at the farmers' market where she sells handmade hats during the summer months. 'I don't know if it's the scenery that brought them here or the fact that it is the end of the road and therefore more isolated. I mean, you have to drive along way to nd other activities so we have come around to making our own.' STUDENT PERSPECTIVES ST CATHERINE'S COLLEGE 2018/ 41 In the background, the country was ramping up for the primary elections and, it being shing season, the future of salmon dominated many of the discussions. Salmon is a key part, not just of the local economy, but of diets for all coastal communities in Alaska. If people are not shing to ll their wallets, then it's to ll their freezers. Conversations about the climate were not unusual as I went about my interviews. Moreover, at a time when the environment was worrying many, the government seemed to be moving in the opposite direction. In the few months that I was there, laws protecting bears from being hunted in their dens were repealed, companies were taking rst steps to drill for oil in an Arctic National Wildlife refuge area and a forthcoming vote on a controversial pebble mine, that could seriously threaten salmon habitat, was dividing the entire State. Alaska, the Last Frontier, was looking increasingly fragile. On an unusually sunny day I headed along a dirt road on the outskirts of town to talk to pianist and composer, Johnny B. His house was perched on the bluff, an area of high ground above Bishop's Beach, and looked straight out across the bay to the mountains and glaciers of the Kachemak Wilderness area. We sat in his kitchen sipping herbal tea and gazing out at the view. Like many settlers in Homer, Johnny's tale of arrival in Alaska makes for a good story and took on a sort of mythic quality in its retelling. As a young buck, he had driven his piano in a van across the US, parking up and playing concerts to make a living, before heading north-west, hitting the Alcan (Alaska-Canada Highway) and never looking back. 'My compositions are refl ections of my thoughts and feelings about the environment,' he told me, gesturing out across the water. 'I'm writing songs about the things I see every day. There are the mountains across Kachemak Bay, there's the wildlife, the bears, the moose, the salmon, the rivers.' He sighed. 'The latest piece of music I completed was called Blue Ice and refl ects the receding of the Grewingk glacier.' Johnny had written Blue Ice in response to the urgent question: 'Can one actually see the effects of climate change in Alaska?' It was performed at the shoreline of the glacial lake by eight committed young musicians from the Homer Youth String Orchestra who had hiked the ve miles up there with their instruments. There is a can-do spirit to the way Alaskans go about their lives which, up against the harsh realities of life on the edge, is truly inspiring. If you are a musician, you are almost certainly also a sherman, have probably built your own house and likely grow a lot of your own food. Johnny B is just one of a number of local musicians whose work is inspired by and raises awareness of the surrounding wilderness and I felt proud to be part of documenting it. His next piece will be on the life of a salmon. In the face of such environmental uncertainty, it is heartening to see. My thanks to Emma Chamberlain and her extremely generous internship award for making this trip possible. Q There is a can- do spirit to the way Alaskans go about their lives which, up against the harsh realities of life on the edge, is truly inspiring. STUDENT PERSPECTIVES 42/MICHAELA BRADY The Imagine Cup is a global competition, run by Microsoft, that empowers student deve lopers to use their creativity, passion and knowledge of technology to shape how we live, work and play. Michaela Brady (2017, Social Science of the Internet), writes about her experience competing in the competition with teammate and fellow student Johannes (Johnny) Goslar (2017, Computer Science). On 26 March 2018 I received a call that fellow Catz MCR member Johnny and I had been accepted to pitch our app, Common Room, at Microsoft's Imagine Cup's UK competition. Common Room was originally conceived for the University of Oxford's IT Innovations Challenge to address two issues: 1: The various ways in which mental illness affects and even debilitates students at high-pressure universities 2: How ill-informed students are about where they can turn in times of crisis. At Oxford, academic pressure coalesces with social pressures, and students can nd themselves running around their College con ding in people who, albeit sympathetic and supportive, may not be able to provide effective strategies to combat their particular issues. Common Room connects students to the best therapy Michaela Bradyprovider for their speci c needs via a mobile app as well as a website - and Facebook Messenger-embeddable chatbot. Availability on multiple platforms allows users to access the app on multiple devices. The primary service is automated triage based on a user's reported symptoms (e.g. insomnia, low mood, low appetite and lack of energy could be coded as sleep deprivation and depression). From there, the bot would assign the user to a welfare gure that could best address their needs. All providers for Oxford colleges would be listed in a database, and the bot would assign support gures based on the user's college, department and severity of their problem. After Common Room advanced to the pitch stage of the Innovations Challenge, Johnny agreed to help me develop the technical side of things, as I only had pitched a concept and some graphics. To make the development process more interesting, he suggested we submit the idea to the Imagine Cup: a student developer competition in which apps using Microsoft Azure products compete at a national level, then advance to a global competition. Submissions should not only be technologically impressive, but also have a greater altruistic, social aim. If nothing else, submitting to this competition would be an exercise for us, pushing us to hone in on what technology we would use to make Common Room work. We did not expect to be accepted, and the process of creating a demo video, re ning our presentation, and rearranging our travel plans with two weeks' notice was certainly overwhelming. Yet on 6 April I found myself entering Microsoft London, receiving a nametag with the four STUDENT PERSPECTIVES ST CATHERINE'S COLLEGE 2018/ 43 coloured squares we know all too well printed in the top right corner. After an introduction, we had the pleasure of hearing Rob Fraser, Senior Director of Commercial Software Engineering, present an overview of Microsoft's innovations. Then, the CEO of last year's Imagine Cup winner, Donaco, discussed his takeaways from the experience, as well as how he continues to bene t from the connections made at the Imagine Cup. When we were called up to pitch, we faced four judges, a room of eager student developers, and a massive countdown clock. We were praised for the interdisciplinary team - an MSc in Computer Science and MCR Welfare Of cer paired with an MSc in Social Science of the Internet with a background in clinical and experimental psychology - and challenged to devise solutions to privacy regulations in the GDPR and ethical concerns when dealing with distressed users. Unfortunately, we did not win. Feeling a mixture of gratitude and defeat, we headed to the caf\u00e9 area for drinks, a chance to play with VR and AR games, and networking. One of the most uplifting conversations was with one of the judges, Haiyan Zhang. She assured us our app idea tted Microsoft's research interests, and that we would be welcome to present Common Room as an example of mental health technology at Microsoft Research Cambridge in the coming months. Her offer was not an empty, conciliatory remark. In July, after participating in the Sa\u00efd Business School's VIEW-2 accelerator programme, I arrived in Cambridge with a re ned presentation, an improved understanding of Common Room as a business as well as an app, and newfound con dence when pitching the idea to people both in and outside of the tech world. Brimming with excitement, I jumped up to the podium to nd a fairly full room of Cambridge students, interns and Microsoft employees. Seeing the nods and general interest in Common Room was especially comfort ing, and the questions were not as critical as those I'd faced in prior pitches. Some audience members even proposed ideas for app updates down the line. Perhaps this is the beginning of an incredible endeavour and Johnny and I will continue working on Common Room in the near future. Perhaps it was a one-off experience. I'd like to think that the app will lie dormant for now, but that it is still a mandatory technology for universities to adopt. If fortune shines upon us again, Common Room will be implemented, connecting students to the help they need and improving student mental health as a whole.

ALUMNI 44/BEREN MONEYBeren Money (1995, English), BAFTA Award winning television producer Beren Money (1995, English) is a television producer. This year a series he developed and executive produced, Cruising with Jane McDonald won the BAFTA Award for Best Feature. Here he shares with us some highlights from his career since his time at St Catz. My time at St Catz and my degree in English prepared me well for a career in television production. Michael Gearin Tosh's English department was like nowhere else in the university. It was independent, free-spirited, and incredibly glamorous. We were taught to carve our own path through both the subject and through life - an essential skill for any creative career. My career in television began after I spent an afternoon in a pub with another Catz English alumnus, Piers Torday. Piers had gone into TV and made it sound like great fun - he inspired me. What I love about my work is that TV is constantly reinventing itself, and so there are basically no rules about what can and can't be done. You can reinvent the wheel over and over again. There's nothing better than being able to break some rule or challenge the way programmes are 'supposed' to be made. I loved messing with how history documentaries are supposed to be made by getting a heavily tattooed historian to tell the story of the Plantagenets as if it was Game of Thrones, in Britain's Bloodiest Dynasty . I'm most proud of giving great talents the break they deserve - like putting comedian Mo Gilligan on screen for the rst time. Earlier this year, a series I developed and executive produced, Cruising with Jane McDonald, won the BAFTA for 'Best Feature'. Expectations were low - a travelogue on cruise ships, following a singer who was \u00a9 Robert Wilson ST CATHERINE'S COLLEGE 2018/ 45ALUMNI famous 17 years ago, on Channel 5. But Jane proved to be TV gold, and aided by a brilliant production team we managed to a deliver a series that was a ratings and critical success. We couldn't believe it when we won - I'm not sure Jane's recovered yet! I certainly haven't got used to seeing the trophy on my mantelpiece. My advice for anyone contemplating a similar career path would be to go for it - if you're full of ideas and a passion to get them made, there's never been a more exciting time to be working in television. As for me, I've recently teamed up with a colleague from Cruising and the UK's most respected magic producer to create a new production company called FAB. We're working with some of the best talent in the business and developing incredible new magic acts - check out Magical Bones and Piff t he Magic Dragon to see more!

My subject, Geography, was hugely stimulating thanks, in large part, to the late Ceri Peach, but did not naturally point me to a sustainable career path after my brief time in the Army was suddenly cut short. So, after qualifying as an accountant, I moved into the City to use my analytical skills. But these did not protect me from the tidal wave that shook up the sector when the dot-com bubble burst. It was from here that through a bit of luck, some further study and some hard work that I had the chance to do something using the more creative side of my brain. Now, I am a freelance photographer balancing my work life between corporate shoots - for the likes of Siemens and the Tate Modern as well as smaller businesses, charities and organisations in the creative arts - and news coverage for the international media, via agencies and direct. Both allow me the privilege of meeting lots of interesting and dynamic people as well as witnessing extraordinary places and events. It is not an easy world in which to make a living, and can also be technically challenging, but it rarely ceases to be fascinating and is both visually and intellectually rewarding. To give a sense of how this works for me in my day to da y world, the accompan ying images show a sample of usages of my work over a month: 1. An image from the Annie Albers exhibition at the Tate Modern for the Guardian. She 1 created wonderful textiles and luckily, for me, some art students came along to provide contrast and perspective for one of her works. 2. Brexit is a major topic at the moment, and this shot was from a Wooferendum 'walk' by dogs and their owners, protesting against the potential loss of their pet passports. A erce stare from Daphne the Dachshund made this one of the main images for the Guardian 's coverage.ALUMNIST CATHERINE'S COLLEGE 2018/ 47 42 for that reason, I just liked the composition and it shows it pays off to also shoot wide shots as well as details or high prole items.3. This image was from the Oceania exhibition at the Royal Academy but was used because it was probably the only image of a trough that Islanders wanted back, according to the Times' story. I did not take it 4. A more conventional shot of the Oceania exhibition, again used by the Times but this time to illustrate the exhibition. It places a contemporary artwork in the context of the grand central room at the RA. 3ALUMNI48/GUY BELL 5. This image of the smog over central London and the Palace of Westminster was used by the Guardian to illustrate the problems of clean air in our major cities. It was actually taken by me when on a corporate portrait job high up in an ofce block. I was drawn by the atmospheric view and opportunistically took the shot, despite it being nothing to do with my shoot at the time. 6. This year is the 100th anniversary of the RAF and this image, used by the Telegraph, was of a World War II bomber being prepared for the Battle of Britain Air Show at the Imperial War Museum Duxford. During the day I led over 100 shots of everything from Spitres to the Red Arrows but this was actually my rst shot of the day!ALUMNI 76 5ST CATHERINE'S COLLEGE 2018/ 49ALUMNI 9 7. The Psychobarn, an installation in the Royal Academy courtyard, used by the Guardian as a picture of the week. Like other photographers, I took close-ups and shots in the courtyard, but unlike them I also crossed Piccadilly to put the artwork in the context of the Academy's grand entrance. 8. The Tate bought a set of images from me for use in their Annual Report. This one was taken from a new bridge above the Turbine Hall and shows the benets of always looking for a new perspective. It also shows the benet of building relationships allowing a crossover between news and corporate work.9. Working for The New Generation Festival in Florence covering their second year bringing new operatic, musical and acting talent to an international audience. This was a corporate job that led to a full-page feature in the Daily Telegraph. It was also an example of the importance of satisfying deadlines - in this case, editing through the night paid off in coverage. 10. The papers, in this case the Guardian, often use images as standalone stories to add interest to their news pages. They also often send their own photographers, so competition is often intense. In this case I chose to shoot the image wide, putting the key paintings in a wider context, and I presume that this was enough to persuade the picture desk not to use the images submitted by their own photographer.

But I think more broadly, what struck me most was how at home I felt pretty much from day one. There was a real feeling of community about the place and we stuck together through thick and thin. You are learning so much at that age, developing emotionally and psychologically and you look back and you did it in such a warm and giving place: it feels good. How did it prepare you for the career you now lead?The whole process of an Oxford humanities degree prepar e s you so well for a life of writing and argumentation. Complex essays, analysing data, forming opinions: these skills undergird the columns and books that I write now and were formed right there on Manor Road. Thinking about the question more indulgently, perhaps there is something optimistic and radical in the water at Catz that took me into social change, into activism, and has now led me to the Royal Society of Arts. Catz is one of the few places in Oxford with a genuinely progressive soul; perhaps it never left me. What is your favourite thing about the work you do?A lot of my writing for newspapers or in my books, and a lo t o f my work leading on the economy at the RSA, focuses on change, the process of change, and how inspirational people are making change happen. Change-makers are optimistic people by nature - broadly they believe in the possibility of something better. Getting up each day and thinking it could be better than the last and engaging with others who believe similarly - and have the genius to bring it about - is just about as good as it gets. Inspiration and brilliance is a powerful cocktail and you only hope that by some magic or osmosis, some of it seeps into your own system.He was the youngest ever Chief Executive of the UK's leading network for charity and social enterprise leaders, ACEVO, and was recently appointed the Director of Economy at the Royal Society of Arts. We caught up with Asheem to ask him some questions on his career so far.ALUMNIST CATHERINE'S COLLEGE 2018/51ALUMNI What do you consider the proudest moments of your career so far?There have been a few but I think being part of the team that wo n Prospect Magazine's 'One to Watch' award when I was quite young showed me that the things in which I was interested were real issues that were interesting to a wider audience. Sometimes you need a bit of external afrmation to give you the condence to believe in yourself and push on; to leave behind the corporate world and plough your own furrow as a writer and a thinker. Secondly, the publication of my rst book The Moral Marketplace: How Mission-Driven Millennials and Social Entrepreneurs Are Changing Our World. This was a personal milestone that also made me very happy for all the people whose work was featured in it, people who live the world over and who gave so much despite never having heard of me or my ideas. It was wonderful to be able to give them something back after everything they shared with me about their lives and work. And when the book was so well-received, well that was wonderful too!The book was the culmination of years of thinking about social entrepreneurship and observing the practices of those who set up organisations that change the world. It was also the product of travel and adventure: of many, many interviews conducted with inspirational people doing good in some of the harshest enclaves of our planet. For example, I travelled to remote villages outside of Calcutta to meet a man who had spent years organically breeding a new kind of 'super-chicken' that could out-ght a jackal and out-think a snake (seriously). What he found was that introducing these chickens into rural environments supported local farms - but also had another effect. It changed the lives of much-abused village-dwelling women, who nally had a reliable source of income from these super-eggs that raised their prestige levels and insulated them against the more wanton behaviour of their menfolk. So you have chicken rearing on one hand, leading to gender equality on the other. It is these weird and wonderful connections I love spotting in this space, and you nd them everywhere from housing co-ops in Hamburg to venture capitalists in Sao Paulo to anti-conflict incubators in Lebanon... it is quite a ride. What's next for you? I recently became Director of Economy at the Royal Socie ty of Arts so right now I am taking forward our work on AI, power and people, on the future of work, on asset redistribution and more besides. There will be lots of books, reports, television programmes, pilots and more. It is a really exciting time and we are always looking for smart ideas that help tackle social problems entrepreneurially - and people who can help us take on these issues. I am also planning a new book on social entrepreneurs, this time interviewing those whose organisations operate in war zones. The travel log should be interesting for that one. I was recently asked by my agent to write a memoir about my experiences growing up in Middlesbrough. I am always suspicious of folks like me who churn out memoirs before the age of 35, so that project is on hold for now. But if there is one thing I have learned since leaving Catz and doing as I have done, it's never say never! Q52/KASHISH SALUJAALUMNI Kashish Saluja (2015, Philosophy), Chairperson of the Community of Keating Scholars, provides an overview of the Keating Scholarship and the work of its alumni. The Betty and Donald Keating Scholarships are the result of the vision and generosity of Giles Keating (1973, PPE). It is an annual, fully-funded scholarship available to up to four students from Indian universities in the penultimate or nal year of their undergraduate degree, enabling them to study as Visiting Students at St Catz for the Trinity Term. What makes it particularly special is that it covers all cost of studying in Oxford such as airfares, visa fees, meals, laundry, and incidental costs for events at the university. It specically funds students from economically or socially disadvantaged backgrounds with the aim of providing them access to the world-class facilities of the University of Oxford. Those who have beneted from the scholarship have developed a more analytical and sophisticated perspective towards their learning, a greater sense of self-belief that encourages them to strive for the best, and the willingness to use their talents to contribute to society on their return to India. The Keating Scholarship provides the scholars with a wholesome experience in a span of only ten weeks. Selected scholars can choose from a wide range of subjects, and experience the unique tutorial-based academic structure of Oxford. As a Visiting Student, each scholar has access to all undergraduate lectures, University libraries, and other academic resources. In addition to this, scholars are a part of the college's JCR and can participate in and represent Catz in all sorts of extra-curricular activities. In the past, Keating Scholars have represented Catz at cricket, volleyball, and ballroom dancing Cuppers, among other competitions. So far, 17 students have received the scholarship and have, on their return to India, gone on to pursue graduate studies or entered the work force across a vast range of sectors, such as political science, mass media, international development, strategy consulting, and neuroscience. In August 2017 the Community of Keating Scholars, the alumni body of Keating Scholars, was launched at the rst Scholars' ST CATHERINE'S COLLEGE 2018/53Mugdha Devalkar, Keating Scholar 2011-12 I still remember the day when I saw the placard with my name on it, and met Benson (the student representative) for the rst time. It has been ve years since I studied at St Catz, and yet the memories I made seem to never grow old. During my stay for the Trinity Term, I got the opportunity to study Neurosciences and Genetics at St Catz. The most engaging part of the tutorials were the stimulating discussions and brain-storming sessions that helped us come up with our own scientic approaches and hypotheses. The one-on-one tutorials, essay writing, and the rigorous reading from several resources were some of the most interesting aspects of my time there, especially as I came from a system which follows a theoretical approach to learning. My experience at Oxford had a huge impact on my life and it is visible through my further education and career choices so far. After my undergraduate degree, I completed my masters in Neurosciences, and am currently working as a research ofcer and genetic counsellor, studying the genetics of neuromuscular disorders. Oxford has a lot more to offer than just academics. I clearly remember how much I used to look forward to every Ultimate Frisbee session on campus! From community work at St Ebbe's, to strolling across the lush green lawns, to fetching a burger at Hassan's, I was kept on my toes throughout this breathtaking journey.Reunion in Mumbai. The community aims to expand the reach of this opportunity to as many Indian universities as possible as well as providing Keating scholars with a strong interactive and dynamic community. Both Catz and the Community of Keating Scholars have been reaching out to an increasing number of colleges across India to enhance the reach of the Keating Scholar opportunity. Presently, the Community of Keating Scholars is being led by Kashish Saluja as Chair, Lalita Tangirala coordinating External Communications, and Rahul Ramwani who is responsible for Internal Communications.

The summer of 2013 at St Catherine's College was among those life-altering experiences that acted as a springboard to numerous opportunities. I have previously worked as an assistant producer at India Today English news channel and now as a journalist and lm critic with The Hindu, one of India's most reputed national English newspapers. Being in the media industry, I have consistently used the knowledge acquired during my Creative Writing and Literary Criticism tutorials at St Catz to write more engagingly, be perceptive in my critique, accept feedback with positivity and, above all, tell a story that makes a difference. My keen interest in storytelling and criticism, fostered during my time at Oxford, also took me to the 68 th Berlin International Film Festival as a Berlinale Talent, representing India. As I played croquet on St Catz lawns with some of the nest young minds from around the world or discussed the political urgency of classic literature with my tutors over a pot of English tea, Oxford reassured me that no dream is unachievable, if you work towards it with utmost earnestness.

Singing in the Age of Anxiety grew out of something I discovered when doing research for my previous book, The Song Cycle : that during the First World War there was a resistance to hearing 'enemy' music and musicians, to the extent that the songs of Schubert, Schumann, and Brahms were no longer performed in London or New York. It struck me as strange that something so modest as a nineteenth-century song could have such political resonance and I was intrigued to nd out what impact the 'ban' had on the reception of lieder, or German art-song, more generally. I also wanted to nd out whether attitudes were the same when the Second World War broke out. Inevitably, as I investigated the interwar period my impression of what was at stake on performing lieder became more complex. Musical life on both sides of the Atlantic was shaped and reshaped not only by global politics but also by the spread of new media (gramophone, radio, sound lm), and economic and social change. The divide between classical and popular song proved to be highly permeable, with lieder appearing on vaudeville stages, in music hall, and in operetta, as well as at Carnegie or Wigmore Hall. The book itself is in four chapters. It starts with musicians arriving by ship in New York and London shortly after the end of the War. Contralto Ernestine Schumann-Heink had to carefully navigate German-American politics, having had sons ght on both sides of the war; African American tenor Roland Hayes found fame in London, Vienna and Berlin, when America was hostile to him because of his race; composer Richard Strauss and soprano Elisabeth Schumann were among the rst German musicians to return to New York after the Armistice. In the second chapter, I look at the ways in which songs were translated - literally, into English (as a way to avoid hearing the 'language of the enemy' and to encourage native song composition), and then from the concert platform onto gramophone recordings, radio broadcasts, and sound lms. Chapter Three examines lieder's position in interwar society. In Manhattan, high society musicales, hosted by luxury hotels, indicated the continued influence of 'Old New York' despite all that jazz and modernism; in London, Walter Legge founded the Hugo Wolf Society and the London Lieder Club, dedicated to recording and performing the composer's lieder and cultivating connoisseurship. As the 1930s progressed, an increasing number of musicians arrived in London and New York seeking refuge from the Third Reich. Their human presence was perhaps one reason why, when war broke out in Europe in 1939, this time there were no attempts to 'ban' German musical culture, but instead endeavours to preserve it from harm. Lieder performances were still ST CATHERINE'S COLLEGE 2018/ 59FELLOWS American contralto Marian Anderson sang Schubert's 'Ave Maria' on the steps of Lincoln Memorial, in protest at her having been forbidden from singing at Constitution Hall in 1939, and there were protests at recitals by Norwegian soprano Kirsten Flagstad, because of her husband's association with the fascists. In London, pianist Myra Hess ran lunchtime concerts at the National Gallery throughout the Second World War. They introduced 'ordinary' Londoners to classical music as a respite from the horrors of the Blitz. Hess invited established \u00e9migr\u00e9 musicians, such as Elena Gerhardt, alongside younger gures who would make their names after the war, such as tenor Peter Pears and pianist-composer Benjamin Britten, and contralto Kathleen Ferrier. I started archival research for the book in 2010, supported by grants from the Leverhulme Trust and the Arts and Humanities Research Council, which enabled me to take up visiting fellowships at Columbia University in New York and at the Max Planck Institute in Berlin. Piecing together who performed what where led me to some curious places, including the basement of the Waldorf Astoria in Manhattan, Liverpool's Cunard archives, and the American Women's Club on the Old Brompton Road in London. I appeared on BBC Radio 4's Start the Week, discussing my book in relation to ideas about cultural exchange, and BBC Radio 3's Music Matters interviewed me about Singing in the Age of Anxiety in September. The Oxford Lieder Festival has provided me with opportunities to share some of this research with the public and I am organising a study day based loosely on the book's themes as part of their Spring Festival in April 2019. Singing in the Age of Anxiety also will be part of the 'Book at Lunchtime' series run by TORCH (The Oxford Research Centre for the Humanities) on 13 February 2019. Q The book itself is in four chapters. It starts with musicians arriving by ship in New York and London shortly after the end of the War. 60/BART VAN ESBart Van Es Sullivan Fellow and Tutor in English at St Catz, on his new book The Cut Out Girl. The Cut Out Girl: A Story of War and Family, Lost and Found was not really a book I had planned to write. I had always known that my Dutch grandparents had sheltered Jewish children during the Second World War in the Netherlands, but beyond that I had few details. One of the children in hiding, a girl called Lien, had been fostered by my grandparents after the liberation and she had grown up as a sister alongside my own father. Yet a row between Lien and my grandmother in the 1980s meant that she and the Van Es family were no longer in touch. I had no memory of ever having met her. Although I did sometimes think that I ought to look into her story, I never did. Then, when in November 2014 my eldest uncle died, it suddenly struck me that a generation and its memories was fading. If I was to do something to recover the story of Lien's life in hiding it had to be now. It was actually not hard to nd her (my mother, in deance of my grandmother's instructions, had kept in touch). Lien was now in her eighties and living in Amsterdam. At rst she was a little reluctant to meet me. The Van Esses, she said, were no longer important to her, though they had been important for a very long time. She suggested that I come for a cup of coffee over which I could explain my ideas. That appointment was at 10 in the morning. At 10 that evening I was still there.Lien's story as it now exists in The Cut Out Girl covers a life that begins in the 1930s in The Hague and runs on until 2017. Not simply a biography, it is also an account of my researches, including travel across the Netherlands and much time spent in the archives looking into things such as the networks that protected Jewish children and also the extensive Dutch police collaboration during the War. Lien's life during the Occupation was far more changeable than I could have expected. Altogether she stayed in nine different addresses: chased by police raids; travelling by night; sometimes hidden indoors for months but at other times living openly and attending school with other children under an assumed identity as a sister or a cousin. Heart-rending documents still survive from her time in hiding. There is, for example, the letter that Lien's mother sent my grandparents (who were total strangers to her) in August in 1942. It begins as follows: Most Honoured Sir and Madam, Although you are unknown to me, I imagine you for myself as a man and a woman who will, as a father and mother, care for my only child. She has been taken from me by circumstance. May you, with the best will and wisdom, look after her. FELLOWSST CATHERINE'S COLLEGE 2018/ 61FELLOWS Imagine for yourself the parting between us. When shall we ever see her again? In the course of my research I uncovered stunning family secrets, some of which were hard for a grandson to record. Beyond my own family's bravery and compromises, I came across many other deeply moving events. There were, for example, a set of medical students who decided that the only way to save Jewish babies would be to register them as their own illegitimate children, fathered by German soldiers. This brought absolute safety to the babies, but also, of course, terrible humiliation for the young women themselves. In the book (which is based on many tens of hours of interviews) I was interested in telling the story of Lien's life under occupation, but I also concerned with the psychological consequences of survival after the War. Lien was one of around 4,000 Jewish children who lived through the Holocaust in hiding in the Netherlands. Those children (separated from their families) came through as damaged people. Few if any felt able to talk about what happened to them during the war. My title, The Cut Out Girl , is a metaphor. At a literal level it refers to the little paper cut-outs that Lien kept as a girl in a poetry album, which still survives. The rst poem in the book is from her father. The names and verses written by my aunt and uncle are found there as well. But as well as the literal book, it refers to Lien's experience of constant displacement: moving from one family to the next and ultimately (following the row with my grandmother) being cut out of the Van Es family as well. In the end, writing the book has been a healing process and its reception has been a joy to Lien and me. It is now out in six languages and has featured as 'Book of the Week' on Radio 4. Q One of the children in hiding, a girl called Lien, had been fostered by my grandparents after the liberation and she had grown up as a sister alongside my own father. 62/HEIDI DE WETHeidi de Wet Fellow and Tutor in Pre-clinical Medicine at St Catz. Heidi de Wet studied Biochemistry at the Potchefstroom campus of the North-West University, South Africa and completed a DPhil at the University of Cape Town. She joined St Catherine's in 2013 as a Fellow and Tutor of Medicine, shortly after the birth of her daughter. Here she shares some of the highs and lows of kicking off an academic career with two children under the age of three, the joys of teaching exceptional students and her research into fat metabolism and appetite regulation. I have always thought myself very lucky to be in a position where I am paid to do what I love most - science and teaching. Incorporating motherhood with scientic research later in my career felt strangely appropriate as both these callings are unpredictable, infuriating, exhilarating, devastating and hugely gratifying, often at the same time. Truth be told, there is little difference between sleeping on the floor of your ofce so that you can catch that 4am sample for a yeast growth curve, and sleeping on the floor in front of your six-month-old's cot because you were simply too tired to walk the long way back to your own bed at 4am. Being able to cope with the unpredictable is a great advantage in both science and parenthood. My children's nursery, fondly called Ground Zero by us parents, had a policy of displaying information on the nursery door of the current microbes and viruses making their happy way through the inmates. One moment that certainly stands out for me was at 8:15am on a Friday morning of Michaelmas term, with a 9am lecture looming, when I was confronted with a notice saying 'Parents are advised that cases of Vomiting bug, Foot and Mouth, Measles and Chicken Pox have been reported in the nursery. Please discuss any concerns with the Manager'. My rst year at St Catherine's certainly did pass in a blur of sleep-deprived days and confused email conversations involving new terms such as 'college collections', 'battels' and 'sub fusc'.I owe the rst year pre-clinical medicine cohort of 2013 a heartfelt 'chapeau' for dealing with my unbridled criticism of their essays, often delivered in the early hours of the morning bouncing a colicky baby on my knee, with grace and fortitude. One of the great advantages of teaching enthusiastic students is the curiosity they bring to tutorials: I know without a shadow of a doubt that I have consistently learned more from my students than they have learned from me. I never cease to be amazed by students' capacity to look at old material in new ways.One of the great pitfalls of being in a specic scientic research eld for a long period of time is the fact that one is very familiar with the existing literature FELLOWSST CATHERINE'S COLLEGE 2018/63and the history of one's subject - in other words, you know what is not possible. Students come to the table with no pre-existing prejudice of what can and cannot be done and the Final Honours School students I have hosted in my laboratory for their practical project placements have consistently diversied my work into areas I would not necessarily have considered if it was not for a student suggesting that we should attempt the impossible. Tutoring a broad subject eld, such as the Physiology and Pharmacology syllabus for rst year medics, does have some natural drawbacks and challenges too. My enthusiasm toward kidneys has never extended beyond Nigel Slater recipes for this particular delicacy, and I have been consistently unsuccessful in fooling my students in the death throes of Trinity Term that I know more about electrolyte homeostasis than they do. College life has also contributed to my research into energy metabolism in man in unexpected ways. My research focuses on the hormones secreted from the gut in response to the arrival of digested food in the small intestine - these hormones have powerful repercussions on our metabolism and drive feelings of hunger, satiety and the release of insulin from pancreatic beta-cells, to name but a few roles. But these hormones also activate regions of the brain which underpin the emotional relationship we have with our food. That blissful feeling you have after eating two bars of good quality Belgian chocolate is the result of a hormone called serotonin, secreted in large amounts from your gut in response to ingested sugar and fat. Find yourself lurking in front of the fridge at 1am? That's a hormone called ghrelin, secreted by the cells of a shrunken, empty stomach. College dinners and celebrations provided me with ample time to observe how our biological need for calories are deeply intertwined with our more complex social behaviours such as our need to feel safe and valued and the necessities of courtship, displays of social hierarchy and coherence that forms the bedrock of a happy group of homo sapiens . The greatest challenges that the medical students we are training now will be facing in their future is the growing population of children and young adults who bring with them the metabolic blueprint of poor nutrition, often combined with the mental health aspects that frequently go hand-in-hand with dietary disease. St Catz is a unique college in the way that it reflects its motto Nova et Vetera, which translates as 'Things both new and old', in every aspect of college life. After almost ve years in post, I am now starting to feel that I am getting to grips with juggling lecturing, tutoring, research and family and one starts to develop a sense for the comfort ing rhythm of the three terms, punctuated with events such as the Feast, Catz Night, Catz Ball, Admissions and, of course, Finals. For me, the exact moment I realised that I had become a Catz Fellow was when I learned where the bottle opener was kept in the SCR. I am looking forward to many more years of teaching some of the most gifted students on offer and to nally getting to grips with counter current multiplication and its role in the formation of the corticopapillary osmotic gradient in the kidney. Q St Catz is a unique college in the way that it reflects its motto Nova et Vetera in every aspect of college life.FELLOWS64/SIR PATRICK NAIRNEFELLOWS The Coincidence of Novembers by Sir Patrick Nairne, edited by Sandy Nairne Since my father, Sir Patrick Nairne (Master of St Catherine's, 1981-88) died in 2013, I have been sorting his papers. One result has been creating a book of his writings, working with a publishing company, Unbound, and seeking supporters to make it a reality. A well-designed hardback edition (with a special edition for advance supporters), it will include images of some of my father's best watercolours. My parents loved their time at St Catherine's, and later my father remembered: 'In July 1981 I retired from the Civil Service after 34 years in Whitehall. At the start of the year I had been - another most surprising turn of events - elected Master of St. Catherine's College, Oxford... Thus occurred another signicant November occasion - the beginning of a complete change of life for Penny and me, as I became Head of an Oxford college. We arrived at the College, worn out, in the early hours of a dark November day. As strangers in an alien land, we felt somewhat isolated in the Lodgings: the College buildings only a few yards away, but unknown territory for us both... It had, in fact, been left until after my arrival to settle the day on which I should effectively become Master. The Acting Master, Derek Davies, the senior Law fellow, and I quickly decided that it might as well be straightaway, and on that rst evening we attended a College concert in the hall. I recollect a most delightful performance of Weber's bassoon concerto, and that one of the fellows announced that Penny and I were present. A glass of wine followed while we chatted to the students standing around us: they were encouragingly friendly. It was the earliest of days, but, as we walked back to the Lodgings, I felt that we had been presented with a good heritage.' After my father's death my brothers and sisters and I found texts in near nal draft form including a survey of key moments in his life spanning much of the twentieth-century, accounts of his childhood with his Scottish parents and the North African and Sicily campaigns with the Seaforth Highlanders, a meditation on what it meant to be an enquiring Christian working in public life, a ringside view of the Falklands Islands Review Committee, and a vivid description of Hong Kong during his oversight of the consultation process ahead of the territory being handed back to China. He also left a fascinating chapter reflecting on contemporary art. As I worked through his papers I found unpublished typescripts, articles and texts for talks. Even though this didn't add up to a conventional autobiography these vivid 'glimpses' reinforced my sense that he knew that his 20th Century life might be of real interest to others. I have written a Foreword, trying to capture something of him. Here is an excerpt: Tuesday 15 th August 2006. My 85th Birthday. Oh dear. 'At my back I always hear/Time's winged chariot hurrying near' 'Pain Diary Coy Mistress'ST CATHERINE'S COLLEGE 2018/ 65Trim but not tall, my father was still a man to look up to. In my teenage years, I became increasingly aware of the importance of his role and status as a senior civil servant. In 1970 he came to lecture to the sixth-form at school and I listened with rapt attention as he described responding to the Torrey Canyon oil spill disaster of a year or so earlier. There were occasional events linked to his work. To stand at the sill of the Admiralty or Cabinet Ofce windows to watch the Trooping of the Colour was a great thing ... Q If you would like to subs cr ibe to The Coincidence of Novembers , please visit unbound.com and search for the title, where there is information about the book and the various levels of support. Thank you - Sandy Nairne (sandynairne43@gmail.com) I may not always see my father, but I often hear him nearby. With his soft, but insistent voice - an occasional slur on the r's, but an otherwise clear intonation and his slightly old-fashioned home counties' accent. His voice seems intertwined with the written words: the carefully chosen phrases, his precise punctuation and spacing of text. I can picture him writing if I wish. Indeed, my father sitting at his desk in his study at South Lodge is an early and persistent childhood memory ... He might turn around as I enter, or signal for me to come in while he nishes some dictation, or completes a letter or postcard in his ne italic hand. I would wait, and then he would give me his attention ... Somewhat against himself, he would sometimes quote the well-known line from Logan Pearsall Smith: 'People say that life is the thing, but I prefer reading.' He did read a lot - and enjoyed crosswords - from a very young age, which gave him a lifelong love of words, but always linked to his interest in people, history and art. * * * To ask what kind of a father he was is to open up many questions about a father-son relationship spanning 60 years. He couldn't be there when I was born, because in June 1953 he was conned to the Benenden Sanatorium in Kent, being treated for tuberculosis, and my mother was staying near Winchester with her parents-in-law. Nor could we celebrate my 60 th birthday together as he had died just days before, aged nearly 92. But pretty much everything in between involved my love and respect for an excellent (though modest) man and an immensely supportive father, whom I admired and adored. Words already feel inadequate ...Left: South Lodge, watercolour by Patrick Nairne for Christmas Card, 1955 Right: Sir Patrick Nairne with Lord Bullock, 2018 CERI PEACH Professor Ceri Peach, Emeritus Fellow, died on 2 October, aged 78. Born in Bridgend, Wales in 1939, Ceri rst came up to Oxford in 1958 to read Geography at Merton. After completing his DPhil at Brasenose in 1964, he began to lecture at Merton College, before being appointed to a Lecturership at St Catherine's College. Ceri was a Tutorial Fellow in Geography from 1969-2007, and alongside that role undertook many other positions in College, including Domestic Bursar, Senior Tutor, Finance Bursar and Acting Master in 1993-94. During his time at St Catz, the number of undergraduate geographers accepted by the College increased from four each year to between 10 and 12. His main eld of research was migration, and the segregation of minority ethnic and religious groups in Britain, America and Western Europe, and outside of his research, he always maintained a keen interest in Catz rowing. On his retirement in 2007, he was elected to an Emeritus Fellowship of St Catz, and in 2016 was awarded a Doctorate of Letters by the University of Oxford, one of the highest academic honours that the University may confer, in recognition of the outstanding contribution he made to academia throughout his career. Ceri was well loved by his students and colleagues alike. He made a signi cant contribution to the College, the University and the wider community, and will be deeply missed. A full obituary will be published in the 2019 edition of The Year. KEITH BAINES Keith Baines died suddenly on the 17 April 2018. Keith was born in 1951 in West Yorkshire, the son of textile workers, Jack and Phyllis. His academic ability became apparent at the local Primary and Grammar Schools that he attended and gained him a place at St Catherine's College in 1970 to study Mathematics. His education continued at the Imperial College of Science and Technology, London, where in 1975, he achieved an MSc (Distinction) in Statistics and Operational Research.Keith's working life was at the Post Of ce where he took on a variety of roles, but notably as a key statistician, working across special projects. He lived and worked in London for most of his adult life, but in the words of one of his work colleagues, 'he was still a Yorkshire man at heart'. Alongside his work, Keith loved to read, visit the theatre, travel and sail. As a member of the Astronomical Society he continued a lifetime interest in the subject. Music had always been a big part of Keith's life. From an early age he had played the piano to the highest level and continued to play throughout his life. Although a quiet unassuming man, Keith generously supported a number of charities and active bodies throughout his life, including St. Catherine's. St Catherine's remained an infl uential part of Keith's life. 'Catz', as he wrote to others, 'was always with him'. Kindly provided by the family of Keith Baines. GAZETTEST CATHERINE'S COLLEGE 2018/67LARRY BIRNS Larry Birns was born on 22 July 1929, the son of Henry Birns, a businessman and interior decorator, and Rosa Bromberg Birns, a homemaker; both his parents were Jews from eastern Europe. He grew up in Ozone Park, Queens, New York City, a largely working-class neighbourhood. He attended neighbourhood schools, including John Adams High School, and then attended a succession of American undergraduate institutions, including Colorado College, Bard, Bates, Black Mountain (now closed), ending up at Columbia, where he got his Bachelor's and Master's Degrees in political science. Even in high school, he was known as 'the commentator' and as early as 1949 he was condemning US State Department policy with respect to Chiang Kai-Shek. But it was his years at St Catz, and in Oxford generally, that really made him as a man and a thinker. He acquired a wardrobe that he employed for much of his career, a distinct social panache, the barest hint of a British accent, and an urbane and global perspective that placed his convictions in a context. He returned to the US, and, after teaching at San Jos\u00e9 State University, Hamilton College, and NYU, worked for the United Nations in Chile in the last years of the Allende presidency. The overthrow of a democratically elected president by the Pinochet military coup galvanised him into action to be an advocate for the victims of human rights violations and authoritarianism in Latin America. He founded his own non-prot foundation, the Council on Hemispheric Affairs (COHA), in 1975. This Washington DC-based group thrived for forty years under his leadership, producing a range of position papers and policy overviews that advocated for a new and more pluralistic US approach to the region. COHA inspired generations of young college students who interned there to pursue careers in public policy, academia, and global advocacy. Larry Birns was actively and vigorously working at COHA until a few weeks before his death at 89. He leaves a wife, Marisa, four children, Nicholas, Daniel, David, and Sarah, and two grandchildren. Kindly provided by Nicholas Birns, Larry's son.MICHAEL FREDRIC DELLER Michael Fredric Deller was born on the 12 July 1933, the only child of Eleanor and Frederick. His secondary school years were spent at Queen Elizabeth's, Barnet; here, through hard work and determination and with the encouragement of Headmaster Ernie Jenkins, he won a place to study Modern History at St Catherine's, somewhere that was to remain dear to him all his life. At Catz he was also able to pursue his passion for sport, particularly rugby and athletics - never tiring of reminiscing of his many happy hours spent at Iffley Road, where he rubbed shoulders with the likes of Roger Bannister and Chris Chataway, he loved to tell of how he witnessed that memorable rst sub-four-minute mile in 1954. Coming down from Oxford in 1955, he went to work at the Bank of England, where he showed his flair for languages on various international desks; there followed a successful career in international banking of almost 40 years, latterly as General Manager of Banco Central in the City and then of United Overseas Bank (Geneva) in the West End. Soon after graduation he married his childhood sweetheart Mary and over the next ten years they went on to have four children. Having had three girls, he was planning his own relay team; although this idea never came to fruition, he was delighted to have a son with whom he would later compare rugby and then golf stories. During his well-earned retirement he travelled extensively with Mary, and also frequently visited their holiday home in France, where he loved to practise his fluent French. Retirement also gave him the opportunity to spend more time with his children and growing number of grandchildren, passing on to many of them his love of sport and athletics in particular. He devoted much of his time to causes that were close to his heart, including volunteering GAZETTEGAZETTE 68/OBITUARIESat the local Citizens' Advice Bureau, teaching Spanish at the U3A and working at the local Church, as well as practising his swing on the golf course. He remained active long after his initial cancer diagnosis in his mid-seventies & continued to play golf and enjoy overseas trips with family and friends until his deteriorating health made this impossible, a frustrating development met initially with determination and ultimately extraordinary stoicism. He was incredibly grateful for the care he received, particularly at University College Hospital and from Macmillan and always felt that he owed it to the NHS to 'do his bit' by striving to remain t and active for as long as possible. He passed away at home on 27 January 2018, with his wife Mary & four children at his side. ROBERT GIBBS Robert was a retired Lt Col from the US Army who served for nearly 30 years with special campaigns in Vietnam, the Persian Gulf, Korea and Eastern Europe. Since relocating to Sequim in 2007 he continued to serve with the Coast Guard Auxiliary. He was a scholar and taught high school and college level courses in political science, history and government. He had always been an avid researcher, debater and learner. He received two undergraduate degrees and two master's degrees, and also completed two years of post-graduate research at St Catherine's College while at Oxford University. More recently he became very involved with international oil and gas production and transportation. He became an honoured member of the World Association of International Scholars out of Stanford University many years ago. This network of scholars provided him with many cherished friends. He leaves behind Rose, his wife of almost 47 years, who lives in Sequim, his son, Thurston, and daughter, Felicity, and one granddaughter, Madisyn, who reside in California. He also leaves his brothers, Michael and Richard and their families. TONY HANCOX Tony is probably best known to the Catz community for his association with rowing, though his enthusiasm for, and commitment to the college, extended well beyond that domain, and lasted until the end of his life.He was born in 1927 in the heart of the Black Country, and his early years were embedded in an industrial context of iron, glass and pottery production, and steam trains. A romantic attachment to this world inspired later writing, both of poetry written in dialect and work on the engineering genius of J.G.Robinson of the Great Central railway. Tony's rst encounters with rowing followed a move to Nottingham in his teens, where he attended High Pavement School. As a stubborn and reckless youth, he would take boats out on the Trent and 'play' with the current near weirs, seeing just how close to the edge he could get without incurring disaster. After the war, he was conscripted into the navy, but, catching chicken-pox, he missed the boat to the South Seas, being posted instead to the Southern Hospital, Dartford, as Education and Training Instructor. These formative years, in the company of a few intimate friends, fostered an intense love of music, most particularly Bach and Handel, and also, poetry. There he met his future wife Joan, herself a frequent participant in Catz affairs until her own death in 2008. It was Joan's encouragement that led him to apply to the St Catherine's Society, which he joined, as a newlywed 22-year-old, a 'mature' student living in digs off the Cowley Road, and so was afforded the opportunity to ST CATHERINE'S COLLEGE 2018/ 69focus on his three great loves: his young wife Joan, writing poetry, and rowing, rather more, it would be true to say, than his studies. The Catz crew of the time was a ne one with a list of cherished achievements to their name, including the Torpid Oar of 1950. After graduating and moving to London, he joined Thames Rowing Club, training on the Tideway every day after work. In 1958 he became Captain, winning the Elite VIIIs at Ostend, a Bronze at Amsterdam and Bronze Medal at the Commonwealth Games rowing on Lake Padern as part of the England crew. Tony was the rst Catz alumnus to row in the elite squad at international level. He delighted in the many who have followed. His career beyond St Catherine's was entirely focused on industrial relations, with thirty years in personnel and training for Harrods and then participation in several initiatives to enhance the quality and status of vocational training. As Catz metamorphosed from Society to College, his loyalty and enthusiasm expressed itself in varied ways, amongst which was a donation of an Edwardian Hobbs punt for the use of staff and students and being instrumental in the acquisition of the College's Steinway piano. More predictably, he played a large role working with other alumni from the 1970s to form the College Rowing Society and raise interest and funds for the establishment of the Catz Boathouse and repair building at Longbridges. He invested considerable energy in the production of the book 'A History of St Catherine's Rowing 1875-1999'. Already his contributions are ttingly remembered by the naming after him of one of the college boats. Tony met wonderful friends through Catz both from student days and subsequent involvements, many of whom have become woven into the fabric of wider family life. To these, gratitude and affection is extended. Predeceased by Joan by nearly a decade, he experienced her loss acutely during his last years. His stoicism was at its most poignant as he determined to resist this sadness by nding projects to absorb him, always coming to life in the company of family and friends, but above all, by listening to music. He died age 90 from a serious accident on his wedding anniversary, making it crystal clear to those in attendance that he'd had enough. His characteristically unfailing support of and interest in others, his wry smile, and somewhat Chaucerian sense of humour, is remembered and hugely missed.

Born 11 December 1924, to Frederick and Mary (Lee) Hess in Oakland, California, Hamilton spent his childhood years in Bishop, Cobb Valley, and Santa Rosa, graduating from Santa Rosa High School in 1942. After serving in the Army in Europe during World War II, he earned a B.A. in history, philosophy and English from the University California, Berkeley. He studied for the Anglican priesthood at St. Stephen's House in Oxford, England, earning the BA/MA degree through St. Catherine's College, Oxford. He earned the DPhil in theology from Oxford University in 1954. Hamilton met Margaret E. Barnwell at UC Berkeley in 1947, and in 1951 they married at St. Mark's Episcopal Church in Berkeley, California. Together they became Roman Catholics in 1959. In 1963 Hamilton began his teaching career at Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, returning to California to teach at the University of San Francisco until his retirement in 1990. Hamilton was an avid backpacker, traveller of Europe, and GAZETTEGAZETTE 70/OBITUARIESenvironmentalist. He was one of the founders of \"Friends of Cobb Mountain\" (1972) which he chaired until 2015. He was also Chair of the Northern California Branch of the Oxford Society for seventeen years. We will miss his wonderful humorous approach to life and his desire for adventure. He loved to spend time with his family and wide range of friends. Hamilton was preceded in death by his wife of 55 years, Margaret. He is survived by his daughter Mary Hess, and by sons Frederick Hess; Peter and Viviane (Harymbat) Hess; and John and Chris (Hedges) Hess, and by his grandchildren: Elizabeth, Daniel, Katrina, Margaret, Julianna, Michael, and Robert, and by great-grandson Alrik.

BARRY HINDESS Mathematician transformed into renowned social theorist Barry Hindess, who was born in Hertfordshire on 11 July 1939, appeared to be heading for a noteworthy career as a mathematician until, in his early twenties, his socialist ideals made him leap into sociology. When he died on 19 May 2018, he was an Emeritus Professor in the School of Politics and International Relations at the Australian National University, Canberra, with a world-wide infl uence and respect. At Alleyne's Grammar School, in Stevenage, he excelled in maths, and his teacher in the sixth form admitted to his parents that he had no knowledge left to pass on to Barry and could only point him to alternative sources of study. He gained entry to St Catherine's Society, in Oxford (this was the period immediately before it transitioned into a full-blooded college), where he gained a First Class Honours degree in mathematics and, logically, began working for a doctorate. There can be little doubt that he could have gone on to become a distinguished academic in this discipline, on the world stage. But a year into the research for his second degree, and to the surprise of his family and friends, he moved to Liverpool University to read sociology. Oxford may have been disappointed that it would no longer be able to claim credit for producing a distinguished mathematician, but it should take solace that it provided the nutrients to ferment a deep and lasting interest in politics and sociology, that would lead to a distinguished career in another discipline. Barry thrived at Liverpool and his MA and PhD there were followed by teaching posts at Leicester and London before he returned to a professorship in Liverpool. During the early to mid-1970s Barry began to pursue important theoretical work on Marxist political and economic thought, in part through his engagement with the works of the French Marxist philosopher Louis Althusser. This was a period of intense collaboration, centrally with his former student Paul Q. Hirst, but also with Athar Hussain and Tony Cutler. This group had formed around the short-lived journal Theoretical Practice, but then produced a number of major works, including Pre-Capitalist Modes of Production and Mode of Production and Social Formation (both with Hirst), and Marx's Capital and Capitalism Today (by Cutler, Hindess, Hirst and Hussain). The work produced during this period was highly controversial, especially among the academic left. Writers associated with the New Left Review - E.P. Thompson, Perry Anderson and others - were particularly hostile to the duo 'Hindess and Hirst', publishing many scathing attacks on them. Perhaps this febrile and factionalised response led Barry to look for greener intellectual pastures, beyond theoretical Marxism and eventually beyond England, in fact, in Australia. Barry began visiting Australia in the mid- 1980s. Like his collaborator Paul Hirst and a series of other UK intellectuals - Colin MacCabe, Graham Burchell, Beverly Brown and ST CATHERINE'S COLLEGE 2018/71Colin Gordon - Barry's path to Australia was facilitated by the 'Forms of Communication' group at Grifth University in Brisbane. And this in turn led to his appointment to the Research School of Social Sciences at the Australian National University. Many doubted that this move would be a good t. How wrong could they have been? The research professorship at the Australian National University allowed Barry much more time to pursue his main interests. Not that he ceased to encourage and mentor others, in which role he gained much respect and many lifelong friendships. He also met the anthropologist Christine Helliwell and they were to enjoy 29 years together. Their house in Reid, with Christine's extensive garden (and a series of adored cats), became a place of happiness and hospitality. It was also where he and Christine were to write extensively together, including on race and time, on imperialism and on 'the theory of society'. In these years, Barry's output was prolic, with books and research papers often written in collaboration with former students. His work shifted away from that earlier engagement with Marxism to a sympathetic and very productive dialogue with Foucault. This addressed liberal forms of power and the market, resulting in a series of important publications that included Discourses on Power: from Hobbes to Foucault in 1996 and the edited collection (with Mitchell Dean) on Governing Australia: Studies in Contemporary Rationalities of Government in 1998. By 2011, R.B.J. Walker, introducing a special issue of Alternatives on Barry's work, would describe him as 'one of the most signicant but underappreciated voices shaping social and political theory for more than three decades.' In later years, Barry suffered from a number of health problems, which became increasingly debilitating. Firstly, a congenital heart problem was discovered. The surgery for this ultimately became the inadvertent cause of a stroke and then a particularly vicious skin cancer launched an attack on an already weakened victim. Barry accepted all this with amazing stoicism and, typically, played down his problems to those more distant friends, who couldn't witness the reality for themselves. Throughout all this, his intellectual prowess was undiminished, and though his written output gradually diminished, he joined public dialogue with blogs on Australia's detention of refugees and treatment of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, about political corruption and in defence of politics 'when there is so much political work to be done'. In this respect, and with academic exchanges, he was active right up to his nal days. The end when it came was sudden and peaceful, with his beloved Christine at his bedside, holding his hand.Barry leaves behind many acquaintances, colleagues, and loving friends who will miss his rationality, integrity, support and, above all, friendship. Barry supervised around 60 doctoral students, and it is noteworthy that many of them attended his funeral, testifying to a lasting legacy that was both highly intellectual and very personal. He will be remembered as one of the most important intellectuals of his era, widely and highly regarded in the western academic world as a leading social and political theorist. But perhaps the dening paradox of Barry was his combination of acute intelligence and gentle nature. Kindly provided by family and friends of Barry Hindess JONATHAN HORNBUCKLE Jonathan Hornbuckle (1962, Metallurgy) was born in Bedford on 23 April 1943 his parents both being schoolteachers. Moving to Nottingham (his father's home town) he won a city scholarship to Nottingham High School where he concentrated on science, rugby, rowing, art, and train spotting (the school railway society being run by Ken Clarke the Conservative politician). He came to St Catherine's to read Metallurgy. Jonathan (usually called Jon) became President of the Oxford University Film Society and was an avid attender at local Oxford cinemas, his record being nine consecutive nights. In 1965, while at GAZETTEGAZETTE 72/OBITUARIESOxford, he married Evelyn Brewster. They had four children, Joanne (born 1966) a cancer consultant, Martin (1967, who read physics at St Catz, matriculating in 1987), a merchant banker; Sue (1970), a teacher and Daniel (1972) a cabinet maker. Evelyn went on to become a well-respected family dentist and orthodontist. Jon's rst job was with Samuel Fox in Stocksbridge, a Shef eld suburb. He quickly became an expert on the manufacture of special steel and speci cally razor steel. This entailed many visits to one of their main customers Gillette, in Boston, USA. There were usually two problems. Either the steel was of such ne quality that the razor blades would not blunt and lasted too long; or there was something wrong with the steel and the blade blunted too quickly. In 1971 he won a United Steel Company travel award to study the special steel industry in Japan and India. This opportunity encouraged his love of travel, and also provided opportunities for his enthusiasm for ornithology. In Jon's own words he became a victim of an obsession for 'birding'. This included being a founder member of the Shef eld Bird Study Group, and the author with David Herringshaw of the authoritative Birds of the Shef eld Area: including the north-east Peak District (1985) . Most of Jon's spare time was spent bird watching. Typically in his lunchtime, when working near Rotherham he was the rst in the UK to record an overwintering Dark-eyed Junco on Thrybergh Banks. Many remember him for his passionate dedication to habitat conservation, his insistence that observations should be promptly and accurately recorded and his huge generosity in sharing his knowledge and giving advice to other birders. In 1993, at the age of 50, Jon took early retirement, and then concentrated on world-wide travel, bird spotting and expanding his World List of observed birds. He ended with 9600, being for a time the top World Lister . More than 270 foreign trips (all taken on a shoestring budget) put too great a strain on his marriage and Jon and Evelyn separated in 2005. Six years later, in 2011 he married Syndy, forty years his junior, who was born in Manila, Philippines. In July 2017 Jon and Syndy were involved in a serious car crash whilst travelling from Nice airport. Jon sustained severe brain injuries which led to a steady deterioration in his health. He died on 19 th February, 2018 in Shef eld's Northern General Hospital, leaving behind his rst and second wife, four children and eight grandchildren. He will be remembered as a man who had seen a staggeringly high percentage of the ornithological wonders the world has to offer, and right until the end of his life continued to seek out new birds in far-fl ung corners of the globe; But also as a man who was still content putting in many less glamorous hours in contributing to the ornithological knowledge of his local area. A true enthusiast's enthusiast. FRANCIS HUXLEYIn the early 1950s the anthropologist Francis Huxley, who has died aged 93, under took pioneering eldwork among the Urubu people of the Amazon basin. The resulting book, Affable Savages (1956), adopted a new, 'refl exive' approach to the study of culture in which the author's encounters with the 'other' are refl ected as much in personal reactions as in objective descriptions. Francis was a pioneer of this form of anthropological writing - a style that much suited his lifelong interest in shamanism and the altered states of consciousness often experienced by religious healers. While this novelesque way of writing was largely shunned by his contemporaries, eventually it became commonplace. ST CATHERINE'S COLLEGE 2018/73In the meantime, apart from a period as a lecturer and research fellow at St Catherine's College, Oxford (1962-68), Francis followed his own path outside the academic mainstream. In The Invisibles: Voodoo Gods in Haiti (1969), he described vividly his encounter with possession, magic and psychic healing; and in The Way of the Sacred (1974) he expanded this personal perspective on healing to include the study of myths, religious rites and sacred symbolism. While Francis's interests were diverse - The Raven and the Writing Desk (1976) was a study of the riddles of Lewis Carroll - his fascination with sacred healing remained constant. With his fellow anthropologist, Jeremy Narby, he co-edited Shamans Through Time (2001), a collection of ve centuries of writing on the subject. Francis was also an activist for the indigenous peoples he studied and loved. A Sunday Times article by Norman Lewis in 1969 had pointed to the killing of the native peoples of the Amazon basin and the taking of their land, prompting Francis, along with several other anthropologists and the explorer Robin Hanbury-Tenison, to found Survival International, an NGO devoted to protecting the rights of indigenous peoples worldwide. Over the years Survival International has provided a platform for exposing genocide, violence, slavery and exploitation.In 1972 Francis was a member of a four-person mission, sponsored by the Aborigines' Protection Society and aided by the Brazilian government, to investigate the plight of native South American tribes. Their report, Tribes of the Amazon Basin in Brazil (1973), identied groups threatened by Brazilian economic expansion and described the sad impact on their religious, spiritual and psychological health and wellbeing. Born in Oxford, Francis was the son of Julian Huxley, the noted biologist and rst director general of Unesco, and his Swiss wife, Juliette (n\u00e9e Baillot), a writer and sculptor. He joined a remarkable dynasty that included Julian's brother, the author Aldous Huxley, and half-brother, the physiologist and Nobel laureate Andrew Huxley. Francis was also the great-grandson of Charles Darwin's friend Thomas Henry Huxley, and as a child knew such luminaries as Bertrand Russell and TE Lawrence. Educated at Gordonstoun, the school in Moray, Scotland founded in 1934 by the educationist Kurt Hahn after he left Germany, Francis joined the Royal Navy in 1943 as assistant navigating ofcer on HMS Ramilles. In 1946 he went to Balliol College, Oxford, where he gained a degree in zoology, working under Peter Medawar, who regretted that Francis did not continue in that eld.In 1958, while undertaking an anthropological study of Weyburn hospital, Saskatchewan, Francis participated in Humphrey Osmond's research on the therapeutic value of LSD for alcohol addiction. Indeed, Francis was the family's true pioneer of the psyche, counting the radical psychoanalyst RD Laing amongst his closest friends. As director of studies at Laing's London-based Philadelphia Association (1972-82), Francis acted as teacher, supervisor, therapist, and writer. In 1984 he returned to Oxford to give a well-received lecture on Psychoanalysis and Anthropology. He retired to New Mexico in 1990, and to California in 2006. The Mutual Self, his last unnished book, is a musing on the fact that: 'We swim in a sea of mutualities whether we like it or not, and mutuality changes us as we change each other.' Though his third marriage, to Adele Getty, ended in divorce - as did his rst two - she looked after him throughout his nal decade. Above all, Francis will be remembered for his insatiable desire to know things and for his wholesome and robust laugh.

GAZETTEGAZETTE 74/OBITUARIESCEDRIC GRAHAM KAYE Cedric Graham Kaye died in Bristol on 21 March 2018 aged 90. He leaves a wife of 65 years, Jean, and two children, John and Fiona. Born in Elland, West Yorkshire on 6 May 1927, son of Wilfred and Elizabeth, he was educated at Heath Grammar school Elland. Aged 18 he joined the RAF for his National Service and was stationed in Italy and Egypt. After completing three years National Service Graham went to St Catherine's College to read History in 1948. While at St Catherine's, Graham (nicknamed Danny during his time at college) joined the rowing club. As a cox he had a number of successes for the college. These include being cox of the winning boat at the junior Eights event at Marlow Regatta in 1949 and cox of the College eight entered for the Thames Cup at Henley in 1952. The Boat Club remained a link to the College throughout Graham's life. He regularly attended dinners at the College, the last in 2017. It was during his time as a student in Oxford that Graham met his future wife Jean. After leaving Oxford in 1952 Graham began a career in teaching at Chard School in Somerset, moving on to Tudor Grange, Solihull in 1956. Graham was ambitious and in 1962 he moved his family back to his native Yorkshire when he became Head of History at West Leeds School. Four years later Graham moved back to the Midlands to become Deputy Head at Polesworth School. In 1971 Graham nally achieved his ambition to become a Headmaster taking charge at Rodway School, Mangots eld, Bristol. This later amalgamated with Chase Boys' School in 1982 to become Mangots eld School. Graham, like his father, had a strong interest in Scouting. While at Tudor Grange he started a Scout Group which quickly grew to over 100 scouts. Following his move to Yorkshire he became County Secretary for West Yorkshire in 1963. When his childr en started horse-riding in 1968 Graham decided to take up the sport and found it was a good way to relax. After he retired he took people out for rides in Dyrham Park and was still riding into his eighties. Graham also worked as an information volunteer at the National Arboretum, Westonbirt. DR SAMAN KELEGAMA 6 April 1959 - 23 June 2017 Saman K elegama, regarded as one of Sri Lanka's foremost economists of his time, passed away on 23 June 2017 aged only 58. He passed away due to a sudden heart attack in Bangkok, Thailand, where he was attending an international conference at the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Paci c. His passing came as a shock to everyone who knew him, most of all his family. Born in Kandy, Sri Lanka, Saman grew up in Colombo under the infl uence of his father, late Dr. Jayantha Kelegama (St Catz, 1957, DPhil Economics), who was an eminent Sri Lankan academic and civil servant. Saman received his Master's in Mathematics with First Class Honours from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur, India in 1983. Thereafter, Saman entered St. Catherine's College, Oxford where he received a Master's in Development Economics (1986) and a D.Phil. in Economics (1990). He did his doctoral thesis on trade liberalisation reforms in Sri Lanka, under the supervision of two eminent Oxford economists, Sudhir Anand and David Bevan. He also held the post of President at the Oxford Majlis Society in 1985/86. Saman returned to Sri Lanka from Oxford in 1990 and joined the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS), a semi-government socio-economic think tank, as a Research Fellow. In 1995, Saman became the organisation's ST CATHERINE'S COLLEGE 2018/ 75Executive Director, a post he held till his untimely demise. He spearheaded IPS's expansion, and under his leadership, IPS transformed from a little known economic think tank to Sri Lanka's leading institution for economic policy research. He built a sizeable endowment fund to create nancial autonomy, brought together an able team of researchers, and relocated the IPS to a newly constructed building with modern research and conference facilities. IPS stands today as a centre of research excellence in Sri Lanka, lling the needs of various government bodies, international developmental organizations, and the general public. Importantly, Saman protected and preserved the independence and integrity of IPS as a non-partisan research organisation, free of political bias, despite its semi-governmental status, which is no mean feat in Sri Lanka. His legacy is a solid institution that will continue to be the lodestar for evidence-based economic policy in Sri Lanka, and his contribution to fostering Sri Lanka's next generation of economists. Unsurprisingly, Sri Lanka's research and private sector landscape is dotted with a new generation of economists who have been nurtured by him. Saman served successive Sri Lankan governments on a number of high-pro le government boards and committees. From 2015 till his untimely demise, Saman was Sri Lanka's chief trade negotiator and played a lead role in negotiating bilateral free trade agreements with China, Singapore, and India. He was also a prominent private sector personality and served on the boards of many blue chip companies, including as Chairman of Singer PLC. Saman was a public intellectual who gave his enormous talents and energy to serve with devotion the economic profession in Sri Lanka and in the South Asian region. He was the President of the Sri Lanka Economics Association from 1999-2003 and founded the South Asia Economic Summit in 2008, which carries on to date. He served as the editor of numerous journals and co-founded the South Asia Economic Journal. He was a member of many academic bodies, including the Postgraduate Institute of Management (PIM) of Sri Lanka, and the South Asia Centre for Policy Studies. Saman liked people and ideas, and he did so without thoughts of private aggrandisement or personal vanity. Colleagues who knew Saman for over 20 years remembered him as 'the most modest of men' whose 'humility was only surpassed by his humanity'. He was loved and admired by his friends and colleagues, and the numerous articles of appreciation and expressions of sympathy following his demise are a testament to this. Since his passing, the IPS has named its auditorium after him, established a research scholarship grant in his honour, and launched an annual memorial lecture in his name, while the PIM has launched an award in his name and published a commemorative book in his honour. The government of India has recognised him as one its distinguished foreign alumni. Beyond all of this, Saman was a family man. He was a keen traveller and loved travelling to places around the world with his family. Saman is survived by his wife Eranthika, their daughter Jayathri and son Chandana. He is missed deeply by all those who knew him and loved him. Kindly provided by the family of Dr Saman Kelegama. BRUCE MITCHELLBruce Mitchell (m. 1954), 82, died 9 November 2017 after a long illness. His funeral was held at Gloucester Cathedral on 21 November 2017. Bruce was born on 28 January 1935 in Cowley, Oxford, but moved to Gloucestershire in 1939. He was a Chorister at Gloucester Cathedral for seven years and then, after GAZETTEGAZETTE 76/OBITUARIESthree years at the Crypt Grammar School, Gloucester, became an undergraduate at St Catherine's Society, Oxford to read Modern History. He threw himself into University life relishing the egalitarian mix of newly demobbed Service men, ex-National Service men, grammar and public school boys and sadly, very few women. He was enthusiastic about student life, making the most of every opportunity. He played hockey but his main recreation was rowing, an interest he retained for the rest of his life. He stroked the 1st VIII and also founded the Beer and Blade Club. After Oxford, Bruce rst went into school teaching, then youth training where he ran Endeavour courses for the National Association of Youth Clubs. Following this he moved into further education, eventually running a very large department at Gloucestershire College of Arts and Technology, where he inspired generations of students to achieve their potential at A Level. Bruce became interested in local government and served on Parish, Borough and County Councils in Gloucestershire for nearly thirty years, becoming Mayor of Tewkesbury in 1982. At home he project managed the building of two family homes. He became a licensed Reader in the Gloucester Diocese. He kept up his interest in rowing by coaching for various Gloucestershire schools. In 1984 he helped set up the St Catherine's Rowing Society: raising money for the new boathouse, organising sponsorship and serving as Chairman and later President, whilst, in the pre-internet days, also dealing with essential practical matters such as the printing, folding and mailing of hundreds of copies of newsletters to members, twice a term (with no little help from his wife, Julia!) His two sons, Andrew (m. 1985) and John (m. 1989) inherited his interest, both rowing for St Catherine's. Throughout his life Bruce took an interest in fundraising for various charities. He was President of CLIC, raising money to buy and refurbish houses near to hospitals where families could stay close to their sick children, he raised money to re-roof Tewkesbury Abbey and also to put debrillators in Gloucestershire ambulances, he founded a Twinning Association between Tewkesbury and Miesbach in Bavaria and he initiated the annual Tewkesbury Half Marathon. Bruce led a very full life, giving his time unstintingly to his many and varied interests but even so he remained a devoted husband and family man. His wife of 54 years, his children, grandchildren, colleagues and many friends will miss him. Kindly provided by Julia Mitchell, Bruce's wife.JOANNA OXENBOULDJo Oxenbould died on 15 May 2018, aged 59, in London. Jo was well known to many in the British and European Labour movement. Her old friend and colleague, the late great Barbara Castle acknowledged Jo's contribution to her 1993 autobiography, \"Fighting All The Way\", in the preface. She describes Jo as a 'source of strength', praising Jo's '[exceptional] political knowledge and flair' for research. Jo talked often of her years in the late 1970s at St Catherine's, and what a great time she had there. She was educated at a state comprehensive and was proud of getting to Oxford, from where she graduated with First Class Honours. Her friends and contemporaries at St Catz included the novelist, Jeanette Winterson, who Jo said once directed her in what sounded like a joyous production of the musical, 'Cabaret'. Jo was originally from Cambridgeshire. Her dad was a national ofcial of the Transport and General Workers' Union and Jo was herself also later to work for the TGWU and then its successor, Unite. She had two siblings, Sean, and a sister, Karen, who has disabilities. Jo spent much time with Karen over the years when she could and the experiences with social services and the NHS ST CATHERINE'S COLLEGE 2018/77served only to increase Jo's sensitivity, sense of justice and personal politics. One of Jo's early jobs in the 1980s was a political aide to Tom Pendry MP in Westminster. She went on to work for several years as the lead political adviser and head of the secretariat to the European Parliamentary Labour Party in London, Brussels and Strasbourg. This group of MEPs grew in size and prominence during Jo's time there. Her former colleagues remember her quick wit, erce intelligence and sharp political judgement, as well as her great glamour, style and charm. Jo also worked later in her career both with Barbara Castle and for the European Parliament, taking a leading role on projects such as women's equality. Jo sought selection unsuccessfully herself as a Member of the European and UK Parliaments. There is no doubt she would have been a talented and passionate MP. Labour's loss. She suffered from some ill-health and dark days in her last years, but was always good company when we met up, ready with perceptive analysis and insights about the latest political developments. She is much missed and mourned.

Kindly provided by the family of James PerkinDAVID GUY STEVENS David was born at Chelmsford Hall School in 1928 and died aged 88 at Chelmsford Lodge, part of the same school, in May 2017. The third, and youngest, son of Colonel Leonard Stevens JP DL and Mrs Nancy Stevens, David was at GAZETTEGAZETTE 78/OBITUARIESEagle House Prep School during the war when Chelmsford Hall was evacuated to Wellington, Somerset. He later went to Wellington College, Berkshire, before serving in the Royal Sussex Regiment, Cinque Ports Battalion, from 1946 to 1948. He then went to Reading and later Oxford University, where he studied Geography and gained a Teachin g Diploma. In 1955, David joined the teaching staff at Chelmsford Hall and became Headmaster in 1965 until his retirement in 1992. The school he inherited had very high standards and achieved excellent results. Towards the end of the 1970s, David was one of the early pioneers of Special Needs in Education and opened a Language Development Centre, specialising in dyslexia. David was a brilliant amateur sportsman in his younger days: an outstanding boxer at school, he later represented St Catherine's College at hockey, soccer, cricket, squash, rugby and tennis. He played cricket and hockey for Eastbourne from 1948 until the 1960s. Like his father he was a lifelong supporter of the Saffrons Sports Club and became a life member in 1942. He went on to serve on the committee, twice as Chairman, and was President from 19888 until he died. He did not just attend meetings, he took an active interest and it became a huge part of his life. At a moment of nancial crisis at the Saffrons, David stepped in and ensured the survival of the Club. For many, being a Headmaster would be suf cient work, but David combined this with making a great contribution to Eastbourne as a public servant. He was a Borough Councillor for Meads for 24 years, serving on various committees and chairing some. In spite of his political allegiance, David was very independent and liked to make his own decisions. He was Deputy Mayor twice and Mayor in 2001-2. He was honoured by the Town by being appointed an Honorary Alderman in 2012. David was a very private person, but most important to him of all were Jane, who he married in 1972, and their son Guy, born in 1975. He loved his dogs, walking on the Downs, his large garden, classical music and his holidays in Scotland. MARK WARHAM Mark Warham, who died at 56 following a cancer diagnosis, was a City high-fl yer and also a mountaineer who conquered the highest peaks in Europe and, eventually, Everest.Born in Primley Park, Leeds, he was the youngest of four sons to Joe and Eileen Warham. Joe was coach of the rugby league team now known as Leeds Rhinos, which won the Championship in 1961 and 1969, and later the general manager of the Leeds Cricket, Football and Athletic Company. His son attended St Paul's Primary and later St Thomas Aquinas Grammar - and it was there, at 12, that he was involved in an accident with a school bus which almost led to the loss of a leg. The limb was badly scarred and misshapen, and he was told he might not walk again. But the scare served only as an incentive to drive him on. He went up to Oxford, reading philosophy, politics and economics at St Catherine's College, before embarking on a 35-year career in merchant banking with Schroder's, Barclays and Rothschild's, including a spell as head of the Takeover Panel in the City of London. In 2000, he joined Morgan Stanley, rising to become head of its UK mergers and acquisitions practice and, later, chairman of UK Investment Banking. At Barclays he headed the Europe, Middle-East and Africa mergers business and at Rothschilds from ST CATHERINE'S COLLEGE 2018/792014 he was an Executive Vice-Chairman and Global Partner. During his time at Morgan Stanley he was seconded for two years to be director general of the Takeover Panel, regulating all public merger activity in the UK. It was during his time there that the panel was given statutory powers. But his love of sport was never far from the surface. At St. Catherine's he had played in the rst Oxford vs Cambridge rugby league xture at Craven Cottage, London, for which he was awarded a half-blue.He had also become an enthusiastic mountain climber, under the tutelage of his elder brothers, Peter and Paul, initially on the relatively gentle slopes of Almscliffe Crag, near Harrogate. It wasn't long before he was traversing Europe, North and South America, conquering Mount McKinley (Denali) and Aconcagua, and Robert Swannell, his former boss at Schroders, recalled him requesting three months' leave for an attempt on Everest. He tried it twice. On the rst attempt, he was within reach of the summit when he was hit by pulmonary edema, a condition caused by excess fluid in the lings, and he had to make NOTIFICATIONS Professor Terence V R Beard (1954, PPE) John H Bowles (1958, Modern History)Roger J Brunton (1952, Chemistry)Paul Stuart Chambers (1963, Modern Languages) Sean V Elliott (1984, English)The Revd Desmond Evans (1948, Theology)Michael Cristopher Gard Hague (1948, Law)Walter R Harrabin (1952, Mathematics)Professor Peter Harris (1960, Theology)his way back down. On the second go, he made it to the top. The metaphor of his life as a climber and a banker was, said Mr Swannell, obvious. 'He was the only banker I know to have reached the summit of Everest. It is no surprise he reached the pinnacle in banking, too. The same values applied in both aspects of his life,' he said.Additionally, a keen ornithologist and wildlife photographer, he is survived by his wife Olivia and daughters Francesca, Eleanor and Anna.
