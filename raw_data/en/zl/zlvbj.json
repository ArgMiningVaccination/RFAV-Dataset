[5](#ref5rota) ED, emergency department; RGE, rotavirus gastroenteritis. Study Designs REST (Study 006) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multinational trial from 2001 to 2004. Healthy infants 6 to 12 weeks of age were randomized to receive 3 oral doses of RotaTeq or placebo at 4- to 10-week intervals. The primary end point was safety with regard to intussusception (N=68 038), with nested safety double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial conducted in Japan. Healthy infants 6 to 12 weeks of age were randomized to receive 3 doses of RotaTeq or placebo at 4- to 10-week intervals with the third dose given by 32 weeks of age. The primary end point was efficacy against RGE caused by rotavirus types present in the vaccine (ie, G1, and G-serotypes associated with P1A[8] [eg, occurring at least 14 days post dose 3.

[1](#ref1rota) Reference Reference Reference Reference Reference Reference Reference Indications and Usage for RotaTeq RotaTeq is indicated for the prevention of rotavirus gastroenteritis in infants and children caused by Types G1, G2, G3, G4, and G9 when administered as a 3-dose series to infants between the ages of 6 to 32 weeks. The first dose of RotaTeq should be administered between 6 and 12 weeks of age. The vaccination series consists of 3 ready-to-use liquid doses of RotaTeq administered orally starting at 6 to 12 weeks of age, with the subsequent doses administered at 4- to 10-week intervals. The third dose should not be given after 32 weeks of age. Selected Safety Information for RotaTeq RotaTeq\u00ae (Rotavirus Vaccine, Live, Oral, Pentavalent) should not be administered to infants with a demonstrated history of hypersensitivity to the vaccine or any component of the vaccine. Infants with Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disease (SCID) should not receive RotaTeq. Post-marketing reports of gastroenteritis, including severe diarrhea and prolonged shedding of vaccine virus, have been reported in infants who were administered RotaTeq and later identified as having SCID. Infants with a history of intussusception should not receive RotaTeq. No safety or efficacy data are available from clinical trials regarding the administration of RotaTeq to infants who are potentially immunocompromised. In a post-marketing observational study in the US, cases of intussusception were observed in temporal association within 21 days following the first dose of RotaTeq, with a clustering of cases in the first 7 days. No safety or efficacy data are available for administration of RotaTeq to infants with a history of gastrointestinal disorders. Vaccine virus transmission from vaccine recipient to nonvaccinated contacts has been reported. Caution is advised when considering whether to administer RotaTeq to individuals with immunodeficient contacts. In clinical trials, the most common adverse events included diarrhea, vomiting, irritability, otitis media, nasopharyngitis, and bronchospasm. In post-marketing experience, intussusception (including death) and Kawasaki disease have been reported in infants who have received RotaTeq. RotaTeq may not protect all vaccine recipients against rotavirus.
