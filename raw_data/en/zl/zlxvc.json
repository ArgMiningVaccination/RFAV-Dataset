How Naturopathic Medicine Integrates with Modern Healthcare Though the roots of Naturopathic medicine are tied to traditional beliefs, practicing physicians are highly trained in utilizing modern primary care medicine. Using a thorough review of symptoms, physical exam, lab work, diagnostic imaging, and referral to specialists when necessary, naturopathic physicians aim to look at the body and understand individual health as an integrated whole. Once this information is gathered, treatments are prioritized to use the most natural, least invasive, and least toxic options first. When necessary, pharmaceuticals are utilized as well. In this way, naturopathic medicine bridges the gap between traditional therapies and modern medicine. The providers at IAOM are dedicated to working in this integrated and cohesive mindset, helping you on your journey to wellness.
