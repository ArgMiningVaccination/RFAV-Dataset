Polly's first working life was in the theater as a pianist, actress, musical director, and drama coach for opera singers. She made the transition from a performing artist to a healing artist 25 years ago, upon becoming certified as a Zen Shiatsu Therapist/Licensed Massage Therapist, as well as a certified Himalayan Yoga/Meditation Instructor. Polly combines the arts of Yoga/Meditation/Guided Imagery and Breathing techniques into her Shiatsu bodywork sessions. Shiatsu is a Japanese style of bodywork based on thousands of years of Chinese Medical Philosophy, and it employs the techniques of abdominal diagnosis, acupressure (compression on the acupuncture points), gentle passive stretching, and soft tissue manipulation to affect muscle relaxation, improve blood and lymph circulation, and induce a deep relaxation response in the autonomic nervous system. Shiatsu often achieves pain relief and can help retrain the musculature for more optimal alignment. Polly considers herself a teacher above all and loves to teach clients self-care tools to keep themselves healthy, and helping them to explore the narrative of their health for optimal health and well-being. She considers the greatest art to be the art of living a fully vibrant, robust, engaged, radiant, purposeful and meaningful life. Her greatest joys are spending time with her children and grandchildren, cooking for family and friends, spending time in nature, and singing, chanting, and narrating stories.
