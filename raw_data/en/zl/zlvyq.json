Those who are Muslims are often wrongfully treated like torrists for the actions of ISIS and not their own, which is harmful to that person's mental health. Our mental health is easily affected by how we see the world and interact in others. In order for us to have a healthy mind, we need to treat those around us with love and respect and value them for their character.

Community Collaboration Services should strengthen partnerships with diverse sectors to help create opportunities for employment, housing, and education. Client, Consumer, and Family Involvement Services should engage clients, consumers, and families in all aspects of the mental health system, including planning, policy development, service delivery and evaluation. Integrated Service Delivery Services should reinforce coordinated agency efforts to create a seamless experience for clients, consumers and families. Wellness and Recovery Services should promote recovery and resiliency by allowing clients and consumers to participate in defining their own goals so they can live fulfilling and productive lives.TOP HEADER12 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGExecutive Summary 1 Executive Summary Alameda County Behavioral Health Care Services (ACBH ) is pleased to present the Mental Health Services Act (MHSA) Three -Year Program and Expenditure Plan ( Three -Year Plan) for fiscal years 202 3-26. This Three -Year Plan begins July 1, 202 3, and will be updated annually in fiscal years 202 4-25 and 202 5-26. The Three -Year Plan and Annual Plan Update s describe MHSA funded programs including; the program purpose , the monies allocated to fund these programs , and the measures taken to evaluate plan effectiveness and ensure that the programs meet the Mental Health Services Act requirements . The Plan is comprised of five components : Community Services and Supports (CSS), P revention and Early Intervention (PEI), Innovation (INN), Workforce Education and Training (WET), and Capital Facilities & Technology (CFTN). California's Mental Health Services Act MHSA is funded by levying a one percent tax on personal annual incomes t hat exceed one million dollars. The MHSA, known as Proposition 63 , was passed by California voters in 2004 and provides increased funding to support mental health services through five components for individuals with mental illness and inadequate access to the traditional public mental health system. Mental Health Services Act Expenditures The importance of MHSA support is well known to our department, as it's currently 26% of the overall ACBH budget. For State Fiscal Year (FY) 23/24, ACBH set aside up to $176.2 million in budget authority, which is just slightly higher than the previous fiscal year of 2022 -23 at $173.5, but is 25% higher than the FY 21/22 budget. ACBH has been able to continue this positive budget trajectory due to increased allocation amounts from the State and unintended carryover from the previous year's budget where not all of the budget was spent due to multiple factors including addi tional MHSA funding being released by the Department of Finance at the end of the previous fiscal year, i.e. no time to spend these funds in the current year the funds are released, workforce shortages and staff vacancies (at the county and CBO level), slow project start -up, and a slow ramp up of services and supports to pre -pandemic levels. Within the past few years all counties in California have experienced increased MHSA allocations due to the success of the California economy. However, it should be not ed that the MHSA funding stream is highly volatile with a two -year lag of final allocation amounts; so, while counties are currently receiving stable or increased allocations year over year it's important for ACBH to monitor the allocation estimates closel y and adjust funding as needed so that as much funding as possible can be used in the communities of Alameda County. At this time, The Department of Finance has estimated that the FY 23/24 MHSA county allocations will have a 1x increase or bump, followed b y a lower allocation in FY 24/25. However, the allocation in FY 24/25 is still estimated to be higher than FY 22/23, so as mentioned above, as of now, MHSA revenue continues on an upward or fiscally positive trajectory. These increases as well as any new information from the Governor's budget and/or California Legislature will be reviewed during next year's Community Program Planning Process and ACBH budget process. ACBH strives to balance community need in collaboration with fiscal responsibility so that there is not a fiscal 13 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG 2 \"cliff\" where dramatic reductions will be needed and vice versa as much funding as p rudently possible is allocated to mental health services within Alameda County. As an example of this accountability, ACBH has developed two budget workgroups (one for county staff and one for contracted provider/peers/family members). Within these workgroups MHSA spending strategies/guidelines are discussed and recommendations are made to ACBH Leadership. These processes take place in fall through ea rly winter each year. MHSA Community Program Planning & Stakeholder Engagement Process Exhibit 1 provides an ove rview of Alameda County's ongoing Community Program P lanning Process (CPPP). Alameda County utilizes five MHSA principles to guide planning and implementation activities and employs a range of strategies to engage stakeholders at all levels of planning and implementation. Our CPPP provides a number of opportunities for a 13-member MHSA 21- member CPPP Planning Committee (CPPP -PC) and other representatives to participate in the development of our Plans (see MHSA CPPP Annual Report ). Exhibit 1: Major components of the MHSA Community Program Planning Process (CPPP) Despite health factors precluding our department from convening large in -person forums due to COVID - 19, ACBH has been committed to identifying creative ways in which to engage the community and various stakeholders over the course of our planning efforts. The CPPP for the Three-Year Plan is informed by activities conducted during the CPPP for previous Annual Plan Update cycles . The Three- Year Plan CPPP consisted of more than 100,000 community input invitations via a social justice public relations firm, social media, e -mail request s, and a community Input webpage which amassed 16,457 page views . A community input survey was translated into 3 threshold languages with 581 unduplicated completions . MHSA launched CPPP activities between October 28, 2022- January 31, 2023, facilitati ng 14 listening sessions with 170 total participants, each session represented an important cross section of the Alameda County population with data from the Alameda County Profile. Some reoccurring themes from the listening sessions include the following: Address basic needs such as insecure housingExpand family reunification services and treatment courts MHSA Stakeholder Group MHSA CPP Annual Report). community input webpageEXECUTIVE SUMMARY14 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGEXECUTIVE SUMMARY 3 In crease early intervention screening s an d assessments Address the response time in systems such as ACCESS Isolation and lack of community Support the reentry community withdiversion services Expand mobile crisis teams Address mental health workforce ne edsu sing non-traditional pathways More services for the African American community across the lifespan Supports and activities for the LG BTQ co mmunity, particularly the transgender community of color and sex workers Need for increased language capacity Cross -Component findings : Factors Related to Expenditures : Expenditures to sup port an enhanced behavioral s ystem of care through Community Services and Supports comprises 76 cents out of every Mental Health Services Act dollar. This proportion is in keeping with Welfare and Institutions Code Section 5892, which specifies the percentage of Mental Health Services Act monies to be expended on each componen t. L ocal Trends Impact Report : Even though Alameda County is growing, the number o f children is decreasing and overall the county is aging. Women comprise 5 0.4% of the county population, and is home to the highest number of veterans among Bay Area Counties. COVID- 19 and unemployment and homelessness rates represent indicators of the overall economic health of Alameda County that are related to an increased n eed for public mental health services. Examination of the impacts of the shelter- in-place policy on unemployment , housing and homelessness, and environmental data over time suggest that MHSA funded providers are called upon to serve more people in need, especially as the pandemic health emergency continues. Program Update and Changes Significant changes from the FY 202 2-23 Annual Plan Update are in response to the CPPP and operationalized through a three -pronged departmental lens: that of Alignment, Communication, and Organizational Structure. Specifically, we have determined it to be critical for the success of our MHSA strategies and program s to both be reflective of our community needs and supported through departmentwide organizational improvement strategies. Our CPPP and implementation of this Plan Update will primarily focus on our Alignment with county, agency and departmental mission, vis ion, values; improving Communication (internal/external stakeholders); and improving our Organizational Structure and service delivery. In February of 2021, our focus on enhancing our care delivery system was expanded to help chart our departmental course is it relates to the direction, guidance, and set of principles that will shape our transformational efforts towards quality improvement. We believe these metrics to be in line with the fundamental values of the MHSA, and now represent five key areas: Quality, Investment in Excellence, Accountability, Financial Sustainability, & Outcome -Driven Goals . We are pleased that this focus and our dynamic efforts relative to system improvement will continue to support the work and critical areas supported through our MHSA planning efforts. Several critical areas were identified and prioritized through the planning process and focused on a spectrum of behavioral health services and support needs. A variety of key cultural and community - centered strategies, supportive housing and crisis stabilization programming, and engagement and 15 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGEXECUTIVE SUMMARY 4support strategies which target persons most challenged by serious mental illness were prioritized. Including, but not limited to : MHSA Community Investment Opportunities for services, trainings, direct client, treatment, and COVID- 19 accommodations Transform community -based Service Team and Case Management programs to Full -Service Partnership (FSP) model TAY Forensic Focused Full-Service Partnerships Early Childhood mental health expansion projects Washington Hospital partnership pilot project to address emergency department challenges Funding to plan and implemented multiple forensic programs New PEI/CSS blended programs for the LGBTQIA+ youth populations Psychiatry residency and training program in partnership with Sandford University General System Improvement Efforts Performance indicators for MHSA, including the FSP Programs and Prevention and Early Intervention component have been updated for FY23/24 , and include performa nce measurements and outcomes. The MHSA plan and plan element evaluation reports are included in Appendices C-1 and D -5. In addition , the Performance Management section contains a summary of quality assurance and improvement strategies. Additional funding has been identified for the replacement of the current billing system, improv ements to the ACBH web -based data and outcome reporting system called YellowFin, and newly created reporting dashboard on Full Service Partnership (FSP) clients that covers hospi talizations, housing, incarcerations, primary care linkage, employment, education, cost, and data quality. Closing In summary, ACBH has aggressively approached its CPPP process in a manner designed to eliminate as many barriers as possible to promote inclusive outreach and engagement. This Three -Year Plan is reflective of a Departmental recalibration and attempt to regard our valuable stakeholder feedback with a commitment towards Alignment, Communication, and Organizational Structure. Our goals are to create a basis for future efforts that represent a variety of stakeholder and community needs such as culturally-relevant, clinically pragmatic, and community-centered support and care. We are pleased to present our process, plans, and commitment to the future of our county with you at this time.

Af rican American Wellness Hub Update b.Medical Respite Program c. Electronic Health Record System Update _______________ 1 It should be noted that MHSA ongoing budget allocations are set on an annual basis and any unused funds at the end of a fiscal year do not roll over into future years. SUMMARY OF CHANGES FROM PREVIOUS MHSA PLAN UPDATE (FY 22/23) Alameda County Behavioral Health Care Services (ACBH) began implementation of its MHSA Plan upon approval of our Community Services & Supports (CSS) component plan from the California Department of Mental Health in 2007. Subsequently, ACBH received approval of four additional component Plans: Prevention & Early Intervention (PEI); Workforce Education & Training (WET) Capital Facilities and Technology (CFTN) and Innovation (INN), which account fo r the full MHSA funding received by Alameda County1. The below programs are planned for implementation over the next several fiscal years. 1It should be noted that MHSA ongoing budget allocations are set on an annual basis and any unused funds at the end of a fiscal year do not roll over into future years. 17 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGSUMMARY OF CHANGES FROM PREVIOUS MHSA PLAN UPDATE (FY22/23) I. MHSA COMMUNITY INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY Alameda County Behavioral Health (ACBH) developed a new, one -time opportunity for the intention to invest a total of $10,000,000 of unexpended MHSA and 2011 Realignment funds, into our community - based organization (CBO) contracted provider community for FY 23/24 , July 1, 2023 -June 30, 2024. Each contracted provider was eligible to apply for up to $80,000 per entity through an official procurement request process called a Request for Pre-Qualification (RFPQ). The eligible areas of funding include : 1.Initiatives to support the launch and sustaina bility of CalAIM. 2.Staffing capacity investments. 3.COVID-19 accommodations. 4.Renovations/repairs or facility improvements. 5.Vehicles for program services. The One -Time Enhancement Funds may not be used for the following categories: 1. Services, trainings or other items already enshrined in current contracts; 2. Direct client treatment or other services covered by Medi-Cal or any other federal or state funds; 3. Staff licensing; or 4. Ongoing costs. The MHSA funding used for this opportunity will be a combination of CSS, WET and CFTN funding. II.C OMMUNITY SERVICES AND SUPPORTS (CSS) C ontinued analysis and transition of Service Team Case Management Model to Full Service Partnership Model In FY 23/24 ACBH will continue its fiscal and program analysis as part of the ongoing change process to transform the community -based Service Teams and Case Management programs into the Full- Service Partnership (FSP) model in order to increase system capacity and team centered quality of care for our clients who have a severe and persistent mental illness (SPMI). It is the goal to have a concrete plan of action for this transition by the end of FY 23/24. As part o f this transition, in FY 23/24 the Service Teams will be allocated flex funds to be utilized to assist clients in a similar manner to FSP clients. These funds can be used in a variety of ways including emergency housing costs, transportation, clothing, food, etc. The FSP model is a comprehensive and intensive mental health program for adults with severe and persistent mental illness. FSP utilizes a \"whatever it takes\" field -based approach using innovative interventions to help people reach their recovery goals. Clients must be approved by ACBH Acute Crisis Care and Evaluation for Systemwide Services (ACCESS) for services. Referrals to ACCESS can come from sources including but not limited to family members, behavioral health care providers, primary care providers, and psychiatric hospitals. Clients 18+ may also self -refer to ACCESS. All Client are 18+ years old. The ACCESS line can be reached by dialing: 1-800-491- 9099. Trans ition Age Youth (TAY) Forensic Focused Full Service Partnership In FY 23/24 ACBH will implement a new Transition Age Youth (TAY) Forensic, Diversion and Re-Entry Full Service Partnership (FSP) program that will focus on TAY that are justice involved including individuals who are in custody, on probation or in diversion programs. The FSP program will follow the Assertive 18 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGCommunity Treatment (ACT) model which is an Evidenced Based Practice for the mental health teams. The concepts of the ACT model include team- based approach, low client to staff ratios (1:10) assertive engagement, peer and clinical support, person centered, and strength-based services within the community . Clients must be approved by ACBH Acute Crisis Care and Evaluation for Systemwide Servic es (ACCESS) for services. The ACCESS line can be reached by dialing: 1-800 -491- 9099. Voluntary Surrender of funds within the -based Behavioral Health (SBBH ) workplan OESD 34 MHSA funds were originally used to braid funding for e xpansion of School -Based Behavioral Health in multiple school districts . MHSA funding was braided with Educationally Related Mental Health Services (ERMHS) and Early Periodic Screening Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT) funds to provide enhanced (non Medi- Cal billable) mental health services and supports to children in Counseling Enriched Special Day Classes (CESDC) in order to assist these children and their families in becoming successful in school and at home. By the end of FY 22/23 ACBH will have closed i ts school site contracts where ERMHS funds were braided with MHSA. These voluntary contract closures are a result of previous legislation that directed ERMHS funding to be managed by school districts. OESD 34 will remain a workplan for other school-based behavioral health outreach programs and school-based programs braided with MHSA and EPSDT funding. The funding from the programs that were closed will remain for the ACBH Children's and Young Adult System of Care (CYASOC) to utilize in new or different mental health programming such as the new early childhood consultation program and a new LGBTQI youth/TAY program. Early Childhood Mental Health Service and Consultation Program The CYAS OC will be seeking to identify a new early childhood (birth to 8) mental health provider through an official procurement process in the winter of 2023 for a program start date of July 1, 2023. As part of this procurement process the CYASOC will utilize MHSA funds to support the work of Mental Health Consultation through the work of peers, family partners, or other paraprofessional or adjunct staff. During MHSA Community Input processes there have been requests for additional early childhood programming as well as consultation services. This new funding opportunity is a result of these community voices. Washington Hospital: Full Implementation of Pilot FY 23/24 -FY 24/25 ACBH is partnering with Washington Hospital, located in Fremont, to address the emergency department's challenges with frequent visits for patients ages 18 and above, living in the South ern Region of Alameda County with behavioral health needs through increased service options and enhanced care coordination/linkage. The goals of the program are to: provide immediate disposition resource for Emergency Department SUMMARY OF CHANGES FROM PREVIOUS MHSA PLAN UPDATE (FY22/23)19 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG19 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG(ED) patients with behavioral health needs, track high ED utilizers in the community with overarching goal to reduce utilization of ED, and provide care coordination & linkage to Alameda County (or other appropriate county/community services). This program will be a two-year pilot funded by MHSA for $1,000,000. A procurement is planned for the spring of FY 22/23 for a start date of 7/1/23. The pilot will run for FY 23/24 and 24/25. Before the 2 -year pilot ends, the program will be analyzed and reviewed to determine program sustainability. Peer and Family Me mber S tipend Policy Update ACBH has reviewed its current stipend policy and determined that this needed to be updated based on new and/or increased job roles as well as inflation. The policy update will include new roles and responsibilities as well as an increase in the hourly base stipend from $20/hr to $35/hr. Stipends provide a resource to our valuable Peer and Family Member community for multiple types of activities. The knowledge that Peers, Family Members and Cultural Brokers have brought to ACBH has been instrumental in the ongoing effort to transform our system to become more inclusive, culturally responsive and wellness and recovery focused. Funding to Plan and Implement Multiple ACBH Forensic Plan Programs The Forensi c System redesign pl an (aka Forensic Plan) is intended t o reduce the number of incarcerated individuals with behavioral health c onditions within Santa Rita Jail. The plan outlines investments in services to be provided at 'Intercepts to address behavioral health c onditions, prevent incarceration and facilitate successful re -entry while reducing recidivism. ACBH will use MHSA funds to plan and implement multiple projects that have been documented in the ACBH Forensic Plan, including th e expansion of a satellite urgent care clinic with expanded hours, overnight mobile crisis services, overnight crisis support services, and additional outpatient mental health services for individuals released from jail. Services for the forensic community have been a priority area that community stakeholders have identified during various community input meetings in the past several Community Program Planning Processes (CPPP). More information on these programs and their implementation will be included in the MHSA FY 24/25 Plan Update. Asian American & Pacific Islander Older Adult pilot with City of Fremont ACBH is committed to serving those with serious mental illness with appropriate, accessible and culturally affirming mental health services. ACBH recognizes the importance of flexibility and innovation, especially when deciding how best to engage those identified as underserved populations, two of which are the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) and older adult populations. According to 2020 Census, 64% of the population of the Alameda County City of Fremont identifies as members of the AAPI population. Furthermore, 43% of the older adul t Medi -Cal beneficiaries in South Alameda County (Fremont, Newark, Union City) identify as AAPI. Finally, increasing language capacity and the older adult population have been priority areas identified in multiple CPPP processes. To implement this pilot A CBH will work with our existing partners in the City of Fremont . They will hire two (2) additional bilingual full-time clinicians to provide Specialty Mental Health Services to the older adult AAPI community. This culturally specific program expansion will allow the City of Fremont to establish a presence in the two (2) Age Well Centers and in the three (3) Senior Housing Complexes SUMMARY OF CHANGES FROM PREVIOUS MHSA PLAN UPDATE (FY22/23)SUMMARY OF CHANGES FROM PREVIOUS MHSA PLAN UPDATE (FY22/23)20 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGwhose residents are primarily Chinese. The clinicians will provide 20 hours per week of direct group facilitation, with the remainder of their scheduled work hours dedicated to providing additional direct billable specialty mental health services. The clinicians will maintain an average caseload size of 35. Pilot Goals and Objectives: Increase specialty mental health services to older adult AAPI clients by providing services in community settings. Strengthen relationships with AAPI older adults who receive specialty mental health services. Improve penetration rates within Alameda County for individuals in the older adult AAP I co mmunities, with a focus on those residing in South Alameda County (Fremont, Newark, Union City); with a goal of future expansion. More information on this pilot will be included in the MHSA FY24/25 Plan Update under OESD 4a. III.PR EVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION New PEI/CSS blended Gay, Bi -sexual, Transgender, Questioning, Intersex (LGBTQI) youth/TAY ACBH will be developing a public procurement request for a new LGBTQI youth and young adult outreach, education and therapeutic services program. This process will be led by the ACBH Children and Young Adult System of Care (CYASOC) and will blend both CSS and PEI funding for a wholistic set of services. The CYASOC hopes to run a procurement process for this program in May 2023 for program start sometime in the 2023- 2024 fiscal year. Services and Supports for the LGBTQI community has been a significant priority that has been raised for several years during the MHSA Community Input process. ACBH is excited to have available fundin g to begin providing a comprehensive set of services for LGBTQI youth and young adults in the near future. The PEI portion of this program will be listed under the PEI 22 workplan and the OESD 39 workplan in upcoming years. New PEI/WET blended program for the African American community ACBH will begin partnering with the City of Oakland's Oakland Frontline Healers (OFH) program to provide culturally congruent mental health services to the African American community. MHSA f unding will be blended to: 1) support the training of peers, called Credible Messengers, who will provide training and support to individuals in need without barriers, and 2) offer preventative services and supports such as outreach, restorative drumming circles, workshops and community events. In future Plans, information on this program will be listed under the following workplans: WET Action 2: Training and Technical Assistance and PEI 20: Culturally Responsive PEI programs for the African American Community. IV.IN NOVATION (INN) Approval of two Forensic Focused INN Programs SUMMARY OF CHANGES FROM PREVIOUS MHSA PLAN UPDATE (FY22/23)21 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGIn January 2023, ACBH received approval from the Mental Health Services Oversight and Accountability Commission (MHSOAC) for two new forensic focused 5-year pilot programs. Brief descriptions are liste d below. Please see the INN section for additional details. For full program proposals please see the Appendix of the FY 22/23 MHSA Plan Update More information on program implementation will be available in the FY 24/25 MHSA Plan Update and/or on https://ACMHSA.org I NN 7 : Forensic Alternatives: Clinical Focus This project is a collection of three co-located services that are intended to prevent incarceration and divert individuals from the criminal justice system into the mental health services. The services include: Forensic Crisis Residential Treatment (CRT); Arrest Diversion/Triage Center, and Reducing Probation/Parole Violations (RP/PV) project. INN 8: Forensic Alternatives: Peer Focus The Peer Led Continuum of Forensic Mental Health Services is a collection of four (4) projects, of which three are peer led and one is family focused. The project specifically seeks to sup port mental health consumers who are justice involved by helping them transition back into the community following an arrest or incarceration, identify and address the issues that led up to their arrest and/or incarceration, and connect with mental health and other services to support them in their recovery and reentry journey. The services include: Reentry Coaches; WRAP for Reentry; Forensic Peer Respite, and Family Navigation and Support Services. New INN Programs under Development Consumer Empowerment Using CT -R (Recovery -Oriented Cognitive Therapy) Summary ACBH is revising an INN project that was posted in the MHSA Plan Update FY 22/23 to introduce an innovative way to improve mental health through online/virtual peer to peer training. The original project intended to employ Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) as the training approach; however, in the spring and summer of 2022, it was decided to change the treatment approach that would be taught online from DBT to Recovery -Oriented Cognitive Therapy (CT -R). The change was brought forth because CT -R allows clients to find their own path throug h life's challenges while in recovery. Peers have an intimate understanding to these challenges and are well-suited to learn CT- R skills. The CT -R project will develop an online Recovery -Oriented Cognitive Therapy (CT- R) Peer to Peer training program to train peers with the skills of CT-R. This program is to provide new skills as peers enhance their job readiness skills and increase their skills as peers when practicing within peer to peer groups. ACBH wishes to provide a learning environment that is removed from restrictive time and space. An online training program is able to provide an avenue that is self- pace d, recovery-oriented, and builds mastery of the CT-R skill sets. More information can be found in the INN section.

WORKFORCE, EDUCATION AND TRAINING (WET) Increased funding in WET Action 2: Traini ng and Technical Assistance for the Implementation of MHSA required Capacity Assessment The ACBH WET unit will conduct a workforce needs assessment survey in FY 23/24 to inform any program implementation changes during FY 23- 24 and beyond. Per the California Code of Regulations, each county shall conduct th e Workforce Needs Assessment at least once every five years. The assessment covers the education and training needs of its Public Mental Health System workforce and identifies and evaluates current workforce needs. Specific requirements can be found here . T he previous assessment was conducted in 2020, which was coordinated by the Greater Bay Area (GBA) Regional Workforce Education and Training group. Information from this assessment can be found in the MHSA Plan Update FY 21/22 . Clo sure of the Early Childhood Certification Program at Cal State East Bay (CSUEB) , WET Action 3: Mental Health Career Pathways ACBH has enjoyed partnering with CSUEB for the successful implementation of the pilot program to develop and imple ment a n early childhood certification program. As the pilot ends in FY 22/23, CSUEB will now be able to utilize the developed early childhood curriculum and integrate it into ongoing psychology/social work courses so that CSUEB can continue to increase th e number of qualified practitioners that can meet the culturally diverse , early childhood mental health needs of young children and their families in Alameda County. WET Action 3 will still be an ongoing workplan as there are other mental health career pathway projects in this workplan. New program in WET Action 4: Residency/Internships ACBH -Stanford Public Psychiatry Training Partnership ACBH seeks to improve access to high quality care mental health services and address the behavioral needs of our many diverse populations. Improving the pipeline of a diverse psychiatry workforce by growing our partnerships with psychiatry residency and fellowship training programs aligns with this mission as we seek to attract talented providers into our organization. In collaboration with Stanford University's Department of Psychiatry Community/Public training track, we are proposing providing direct training and clinical supervision at a county-run site for one resident and child psychiatry fellow annually. By exposin g psychiatry trainees to our clinical settings, we hope to recruit talented providers from diverse backgrounds, increasing their presence in our workforce to meet the growing needs of our beneficiaries. Each rotating trainee would assess and treat ACBH clients longitudinally under the direct supervision of a licensed psychiatrist. In addition to direct clinical care, these trainees would also receive education about the many recovery -oriented services we provide in the county and have the opportunity to learn about the larger systems of care that inform their clinical work. VI.CAPITAL FACILITIES AND TECHNOLOGICAL NEEDS (CFTN) African American Wellness Hub Update MHSA Plan Update FY 21/22.here.SUMMARY OF CHANGES FROM PREVIOUS MHSA PLAN UPDATE (FY22/23)23 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGACBH, in partnership with the Alameda County General Services Agency (GSA) department, continues to work on the development of the African American Wellness Hub Complex (HUB). This partnership continues by exploring and examining the inventory of County owned facilities for the HUB and other potential suitable sites. In addition to the ongoing exploration of space and facilities, ACBH has created a video to chronicle the years long effort to build a wellness center that focuses on the mental and behavioral health needs of the African American community. A video link will added here and on our MHSA website once the video has been released in late April. In preparation for the Wellness Hub, the Office of Health Equity will conduct multiple listening sessions in spring to better understand what types of services the community would like to see in the Hub once it's ready for operations. Results from these listening sessions will be available later in the calendar year of 2023. Medical Respite Expansion Projects (CF2) ACBH in collaboration with the Office of Homeless Care and Coordination , a division within the county's parent agency Health Care Services Agency, continue to develop new medical respite opportunities. The remaining funds within this workplan's original three- million -dollar allocation will be directed towards the Alameda Point Collaborative Project (workplan #CF4) and a new project called the St. Regis. The St. Regis is a building that was purchased by a local non- profit where ACBH hopes to develop multiple residential mental health services including medical respite. More information on the project can be viewed in the CFTN section of this Plan. MHSA Technology Project (TN1) ACBH has utilized CFTN funds to support the following Technological Needs (TN) Projects: Development of new billing system: ACBH continues to partner with the vendor Streamline Healthcare Solutions, LLC, to formally initiate the effort to provide a fully integrated billing system on the SmartCare Platform to replace INSYST (our department's current registration and billing platform). Streamline and the integrated SmartCare Platform will incorporate all of the functionality necessary to ensure staff and contracted providers work together within and across organizational boundaries. This platform will help to advance the effective delivery of behavioral health care for our clients and the communities we serve. SmartCare will also provide our system with options to resolve system challenges and facilitate enhanced flexibility for data sharing. SmartCare is scheduled to go live on 07/01/2023. Procurement process for new Behavioral Health Management Information System (EHR) (non- billing portion): ACBH is set to begin planning the procurement process for the additional clinical components of an EHR system in the fal l of 2023. Mo re information on this process will be shared in the FY 24/25 MHSA Plan Update.

The carryover listed for the INN component will be attached to two new INN projects: o1-Clinical Forensic Continuum ($13M over 5 years), and o2-Peer/Family focused Forensic Continuum ($8M over 5 years). These projects were approved in early 2023 and will not be available for other projects. You can read about these more under the INN sect ion. The Department of Finance has estimated that the FY 23/24 MHSA county allocations will have a 1x increase or bump due to delayed tax revenue in FY 22/23 , followed by a lower allocation in FY 24/25. However, the allocation in FY 24/25 is still estimated to be higher than FY 22/23, so as mentioned above, as of now, MHSA revenue continues on an upward or fiscally positive trajectory. It's also significan t to mention that finalized MHSA allocations have a 2-year lag time where revenue expectation s can change. Moreov er, external events such as th e global COVID -19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine, supply chain issues, the current precariousness in the stock market and the new bill SB 326 (to Modernize MHSA) all have possible effects on MHSA revenue, which can make the fund volatile, causing future planning to be somewhat lengthy and complex. As a final note even though ACBH, like all counties, is working from fiscal estimates of MHSArevenue that are not always clear or completely certain, the department has taken a stance to push it s budget significantly higher than its allocation estimates in order to put as many resources, services and supports out in the communities of Alameda County. Through this next Three- Year Plan ACBH will continue this focus of providing as many resources as possible while also monitoring Stat e information to ensure fiscal stability.County: Alameda Date: 6/15/23 A B C D E F Community Services and SupportsPrevention and Early InterventionInnovationWorkforce Education and TrainingCapital Facilities and Technological NeedsPrudent Reserve A.

However, the age- adjusted suicide rate is 9.0 per 100,000, which is lower than Health People 20 30 goal, but higher than neighboring Santa Clara County (Table 4 ). Environmental Health California's Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment has created the CalEnviroScreen 4.0 model2 to assess pollution burden and population characteristics that increase vulnerability to pollution among census tracts throughout the state. The pollution burden is measured through the averages of environmental exposures and effects. Population characteristics are measured through the average of sensitive populations and socioeconomic factors components. The tota l score is calculated by combing the pollution burden and population characteristics. Below is a map of the 2023 CalEnviroScreen results for Alameda County ( Figure 5 ). Briefly, the areas with lower burden and vulnerability to pollution are green and the neighborhoods with the highest are red. Areas of Oakland, San Leandro, and Hayward have the highest burden of pollution and vulnerability to pollution. 1 Rates are age -adjusted to correct for the influence of age on health outcomes, allowing counties with different age profiles to be compared. 2 A detailed explanation of the model can be found here: https://oehha.ca.gov/calenviroscreen/scoring- model . 42 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGFigur e 5: Alameda County Burden of Pollution and Vulnerability to Pollution Scores Source 1: California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment , Cal EnviroScreen 4.0 Dashboard, (2023), accessed March 13, 2023, https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/6b863505f9454cea802f4be0b4b49d62/ Mental Health Each year, the University of California Los Angeles Center for Health Policy Research, in conjunction with the California Department of Public Health and the Department of Health Care Services , conducts the California Health Interview Survey (CHIS), the nation's largest health care survey. Researchers gather information from residents of all 58 California counties to better understand various healthcare concerns within California, including behavioral and m ental health issues. Using pooled yearly CHIS data from 2018 through 2021 , an analysis of 5 Bay Area counites (Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Santa Clara, and San Francisco) revealed that San Francisco (15.4 %) has the highest percentage of their population that reported to have \"likely had psychological distress during the last year ,\" while Marin has the lowest (11.5%) ( Table 5 a). Alameda County has the third highest percentage of moderate or severe \"social life impairment\" during the past year ( 20.4%); 13.4% of the Alameda survey respondents reported seriously thinking about suicide. Additionally, 22.1% of Alameda County respondents responded that they \"needed help for emotional/mental health problems or use of alcohol/drugs ,\" a percentage also held by both Marin and Santa Clara County. 20.2% of Alameda County respondents saw any form of healthcare practitioner for emotional/mental health or drug/alcohol issues in the past year.

As a comparison between tables 5a and 5b show, all 5 counties reported increases in psychological distress; moderate or severe social impairment; serious t houghts of suicide; and needing help for emotional/ mental health or substance abuse disorders. Furthermore, this comparison reveals a marked drop in the percentage of respondents receiving care for mental health or substance use disorders from a health care practitioner. While a causal analysis of these trends is beyond the scope of this report, we note that such movement corresponds to the impact wrought upon the populace at large by the COVID 19 epidemic that began in 2020.

One particularly noticeable gap between general population data and mental health survey data involves persons self -identifying as being of Asian descent. This group represents the largest racial category in the Census data discussed previously in this report ; in the CHIS data, however , this racial group embodies a substantially lower percentage of the survey respondent data for any given mental health indicator previously discussed in this report section. For example, persons identifying as being of an Asian race report suicidal thoughts or serious psychological impairments at much lower levels (10.1% and 10.7%, respectively) when examined against the Census general population percentage of 32.1%. Please see Table 6a below for the percentage data. Similar trends hold for persons that identify as being White . For example, 22.6% of White CHIS respondents indicate moderate or severe social impairment but represent 28.1% of the Census data. Conversely, 27.0% of CHIS respondents that identify as being Black or African American reported needing help with emotional/mental health or substance abuse issues despite representing only 9.5% of the Census data. Similarly, person that self -identify as being of two or more races, while representing ALAMEDA COUNTY PROFILE44 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG5.3% of the Census population, represent 36.0% of the CHIS respondents that report needing help with emotional/mental health or substance use issues. The Census data reported in this section reports a racial category of \"Hispanic/Latino,\" but the CHIS considers this category to be an ethnic designation and not a racial one. The comparison of Hispanic/Latino CHIS respondent data vis a vis the Census data reported in this section of the plan has thus been omitted from this analysis. We have included the relevant CHIS figures (Table 6b ) for consideration on their own.

This disease, commonly called \"COVID -19,\" caused life threatening symptoms to emerge in the lower respiratory systems of its victims; the resource -intensive nature of the disease progression often shocked and overwhelmed local hospital ICU's, dealing a crippling blow to their ability to manage and treat their patients . On March 17,2020, six Bay Area counties \u2014 Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, San Francisco, San Mateo, and Santa Clara \u2014 issued a shelter in place order, an action the entire State of California would implement statewide two days later3. The next two years would witness soaring infection and mortality rates . Over the course of the roughly three -year pandemic emergency, more than 11 million cases would be reported in California, resulting in the deaths of over 100,000 Californians. The Bay Area was hit hard during this emergency: neighboring Santa Clara County reported the most cases (480, 775), as well as the most deaths (2,761). Alameda County experienced 381, 972 which resulted in 2,216 deaths. Of the five counties discussed in this analysis, Alameda ranked fourth in both all time- case rate (22,705 cases per 100,000 residents) and death rates (132 per 100,000 residents)4. On December 11, 2020, the United States Food and Drug Administration authorized the first emergency use of a COVID -19 vaccine; four days later a physician volunteer received the first such vaccine in the Bay Area. The rapid subsequent vaccinations of Bay Area residents helped to temper the rampage of the epidemic in California. As of spring 2023, a large majority of Bay Area residents had been vaccinated at least one time. Marin County led the charge, with 90.5% residents having been vaccinated as of April 18, 2023. Alameda County trailed not far behind, with 84.2% of its population having received at least one 3 Source: Eby, Kate (May 5, 2023). \" Coronavirus Timeline: Tracking major moments of COVID -19 pandemic in San Francisco Bay Area .\" https://abc7news.com/timeline- of-coronavirus -us-covid -19-bay- area- sf/6047519/ OVID- 19 in California.\" https://covid19.ca.gov/state- dashboard/#county-statewide Table 8: Fiscal Year 20/21 Alameda County Mental Health Services Medi -Cal Penetration Rate by Language 47 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGALAMEDA COUNTY PROFILE vaccines dose, and 72% of the population having completed the vaccination series and at least one booster shot.

For example, Asian and White residents comprise 34% and 48% of Almeda's population in one study but were only 18.5% and 18.7% of confirmed cases. Conversely , African American/ Black people were 11 % of the population and 9.0% of confirmed cases . A similar effect is noted with vaccinations: White people make up almost 48% of the population in one Census measure but received just 29.9% of the full vaccination status counts (Tables 10b, 10c ). Other racial groups, such as Asian and Black folks, had full vaccination levels approximately equal to their measured Census population number (36.3% and 8.7% fully vaccinated against 34 % and 11% population values, respectively).

The ACBH MHSA Division conducts additional CPPP s as the basis for gathering data each of the two annual update period s to the Three- Year Pl an. Statutory requirements expect Counties to ensure the CPPP is adequately staffed, and that positions and/or units are designated to ensure stakeholders (people with a vested interest in mental health services) are trained and/or have the opportunity to particpate in the CPPP. Although local health jurisdictions are given relatively wide latitude on how to develop a local CPPP in line with the needs and culture of their communities, MHSA programs are required to demonstrate a partnership with local consitutents (voters) and stakeholders as it concerns mental health policy, program planning, implementation, monitoring, quality improvement, evaluation, and MHSA budget allocations. The Alameda County MHSA CPPP builds upon data received during previous fisca l year input processes to ensure efforts target the underserved, unserved, underreported, and inadequately served populations. MHSA engages stakeholders in various outreach efforts, education forums, workgroups, and planning panels to ensure the plan is de vleoped with the community In mind. Since 200 7, over 2, 731 Alameda County residents have contributed to the development of all five MHSA component plans through formalized stakeholder meetings, focus groups and planning councils. For the Three- Year Plan (FY2023 -26), the CPPP was conducted between October 28, 2022 through January 31, 2023. During this time outreach invitations were sent to more than 100,000 Stakeholders (see Appendix B -1 CPPP Outreach Plan ). The process was faciliated by multiple leadership groups representing the diversity of consumers, family members, and service providers. Stakeholder leads were provided training on core MHSA elements, policies & procedures, participant expectations, and listening session facilitation. MHSA provided technical assistance and stipends to participants with lived mental health. Community Program Planning Process Planning Committee The MHSA CPPP Planning Committee (MHSA CPPP -PC) is a short- term plannin g group consisting of 21 members which was re-established in September 12, 202 2 to steer CPPP activities. In addition to the MHSA Stakeholder Group (MHSA -SG), the MHSA CPPP -PC was leveraged as an additional resource to assure continuity of services and adminsitrative transparency for all community out reach efforts, which include: Endorses CPPP outreach plan Participates in CPPP activities (such as listening sessions) Approves CPPP assessment instruments Liases with mental health affiliate groups to increase CPPP stakeholder engagmenet The CPPP -PC participated in a total of 7 biweekly planning meetings.

COVID -19 pro duced a variety of challenges to CPPP activities and required an immediate response to address implementation barriers as a result of social distancing regulations and disruptions to programs and services. The MHSA CPPP -PC from FY2020 -23 identified the following three key implementation challenges and solutions to combat barriers : Administrative barriers , Resource Disparities , and Community Stress ors. The MHSA CPPP -PC focused on reducing public outreach and awareness campaign barriers related to social vulnerability factors such as poverty, lack of access to technology to complete online surveys (e.g. computer, internet); lack of transportation access to provider sites where surveys were proctored, and fragmented communication and messaging. The MHSA CPPP -PC adapted the MHSA public outreach campaign, re -launched a community input website resulting in 4,058 new users and 16,457 pageviews , coordinated outreach through social media platforms (e.g. Facebook , YouTube ), social justice distributions lists and media outlets (e.g. KPIC, KTVU, and KRON), and hosted teleforums where community members were able to provide remote input in three different ways: 1) online Innovations brainstorming webform, 2) remote listening sessions , and 3) an online community input survey embedded in electronic palm cards, e -flyers, and proctored by trained volunteers . In the midst of the ongoing COVID- 19 epidemic, MHSA identified key successes related to planning activities, such as: MHSA Staff Support : The MHSA CPPP -PC importance of the MHSA Sr. Planner/MHSA CPPP -PC chair who remain ed flexible with diverse members and opinions, identified roles & responsibilities, establish ed boundaries, encourage d engagement, champion ed and increased visibility of efforts, and reduced duplication of efforts. Macro -level Outreach: The CPPP outreach strategies expanded to included macro -level strategies such as utilizing paid ads on social media platforms; leveraging online ethnic -oriented news outlets (e.g. Bay Area Reporter), posting PSAs on traditional media outlets (KRON, KPIX, KTVU, TriValley Paper, Post News group, East Bay Times, Alameda Contra Costa Medical Association newsletters) , and utilizing social justice public relations firms to distribute information to thousands of Alameda County residents. Stakeholder Engagement: The MHSA CPPP -PC leveraged the expertise and knowledge of established and engaged MHSA -SG to coordinate planning and outreach strategies . Trained volunteers and partners exhibited ownership of MHSA planning activities, provided communitycanvassing, participated in planning committee meetings , listening sessions, and helped brand outreach activities. The revised strategy was coordinated in response to COVID -19 barriers and resulted in more than 100,000 Alameda County residents and employees receiving CPPP invitations. In addition, virtual listening session trainings were coordina ted for ACBH and community members.

MHSA employed a variety of tactics to engage the public such as hosting community listening sessions , recording educational podcasts with community partners and mental health leaders, and coordinating 1 3 listening sessions with diverse stakeholders. MHSA Community Podcasts & Forums for Young Men of Color: MHSA and media partner Health Human Resource Education Center (HHREC) coordinated TAY health podcasts and forums, which focused on navigating stressful environments, and dealing with the ramificatio ns of the pandemic's impact on TAY mental health. Each forum was facilitated virtually on Zoom and live recordings were publicly posted on YouTube. Subsequent forums focused on the COVID -19 pandemic and its impact on TAY mental health. The recorded events are publicly posted to the HHREC Youtube page at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXL5FVNzGgHSl7YEy4Rc63g/videos MHSA Podcast Series MHSA and HHREC designed a series of mental health focused podcasts featuring interviews with local leaders in the field. The first podcast for the CPPP featured an interview from Dr. Karyn Tribble, ACBH Director which garnered over 4 8,000 views. New podcasts will be released Spring 2023 to highlight the 30-day public comment period . Thirty-seven MHSA podcasts are available on the HHREC Youtube page at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXL5FVNzGgHSl7YEy4Rc63g/videos M HSA Innovation Brainstorm The Innovative (INN) service category launched a webform to solicit feedback on three INN ideas suggested during the Annual Update process for FY22/23 ( see Appendix D-4) .

Approximately 170 community stakeholders participated in the FY23/26 MHSA CPPP and provided input on mental health needs, prioritized underserved populations and recommended mental health services (see Table 5). MHSA developed a revised listening session t oolkit consisting of MHSA 101 Fact Sheets, MHSA 101 webinar and infographic, and facilitator w orkbook (includes a standardized agenda, facilitator g uide, and question & answer to record responses). The toolkit is publicly available on the new MHSA Community Input website at https://acmhsa.org/community- input . ACBH staff and community volunteers participated in remote listening session trainings and facilitated 14 sessions. During the listening sessions , the MHSA Senior Planner, MHSA Division Director and co-presenters facilitated a MHSA educational overview . Participants provided input on five questions to help identify mental health challenges, prioritize existing services, identify unserved/underserved populations, and recomm end future innovative programs and services . Interpreter services were available upon request . The following questions were asked of participants: What are the top or most pressing mental health challenges right now in your community? Are there individual s, groups, and/or cultural communities who you believe are not being adequately served? What do you see as barriers and gaps for people to get mental health resources andappropriate/effective treatment needed for their recovery? Related to challenges identified in question 1, what are your ideas on how to address thesechallenges or others that you may see to better serve your community? What MHSA -funded services are you aware of, either as services you or someone you know has taken advantage of, or as services you would feel comfortable recommending to others? An Innovation project is proposing a title change to Consumer Empowerment Using RecoveryOriented Cognitive Therapy (CT -R). The framework of this peer training project will not change. What innovative ideas do you have to improve mental health services? Other comments/suggestions you'd like to share? The intent of a listening session is not to provide services, advice, or solve systems issues; rather, these open avenues create a space for participants to be vulnerable, connect with others within their community, and participate in a facilitated discussion to add more context to issues and provide recommendations from direct sources. Similar to focus groups, facilitators aim to elicit specific narratives regarding stakeholders' experiences and observations of the existing mental health system. Table 5 summarizes each listening session, identifies the stakeholder group, and quantifies the recommendations and issues presented during the discussion. In this process, a listening session recommendation is identified/quantified as a system improvement response provided during the discussion. The number of issues were iden tified based off any narrative regarding an experience or observation of barriers encountered by a stakeholder.

The survey was available in English, Chinese, and Spanish, three of Alameda County's threshold languages. A total of 5811 unduplicated surveys were completed, while the survey was translated into 3 non- English languages over 9 9% of the surveys were English (Table 1). The following sections detail the demographics of survey participants and the results of the survey . Table 1: Number of Survey Respondents by Survey Language1 Survey Languages Number of Responses 1.

Regarding this analysis , two points need to be considered: first, respondents were asked to indicate as many races as appropriate to describe their racial background. This differs from the US Census data, which handles multiple races by asking survey respondents to check a box labeled \"Two or more races.\" Second, the CPPP survey treats race and ethnicity as independent facts from one another . A separate question for ethnicity asks respondents to identify themselves as being either Hispanic/Latinx or not Hi spanic/Latinx ; it is not considered a race in the CPPP survey. It would be possible, then, for a person to consider themselves both Hispanic/Latinx and white. This level of granularity for race and ethnicity would thus be captured in the CPPP survey but not in the US Census data, as the latter combines race and ethnicity into one question and does not allow for this granularity in its \"Two or more races\" selection. Hispanic/Latin x is not considered a race for the CPPP County Survey, but it is for the US Ce nsus . This makes comparisons between the two data sets with respect to this particular demographic slice problematic, as they are not measuring the same categories. For the sake of clarity, the questions of race and ethnicity are presented as they appear i n the CPPP survey only . Iterations of this plan in previous years contained such comparisons between survey and Census data , but they do not appear in the FY 23/26 plan. 552 respondents answered the question about their race. The racial selection with the highest number of respondent self -identification was White/Caucasian (49.09%), followed by Asian/Pacific Islander or Native Hawaiian (23.55%), /Black (16.85%), and American Indian/Alaskan Native (2.72%) . 13.59% of the respondents chose to not answer this question. See figure 4a For ethnicity, 86.56% of respondents identified themselves as not being of Hispanic/Latinx ethnicity, while 13.44 % of respondents identified themselves as being of Hispanic/Latin x ethnicity. 543 survey respondents answered this question.

Community Violence & Trauma X Children, Middle/High School (ages 13 -17) Concerns 1 and 2: Suicide and Depression There is a real concern for the mental well- being of children in this age group, according to the survey respondents. An overarching theme running through the collected free response submissions is that middle -and-high -school age children have little or no access for mental health care resources. If such resources are available, then there are often considerable barriers such as limited provider availability or long wait times to be seen by a clinician. Furthermore, respondents stated that the global events of the last three years related to COVID -19 and its aftereffects have created further strain on the minds of these children. In the respondents' opinions, this strain has led to an increase in mental illness and associated behaviors, such as anxiety, depr ession, violence, and suicidal thoughts and behavior. \"There is a need for a lot more support at this age. Children dealing with mental illness are often rejected or ridiculed by peers and teachers. There is little help if any, through health insurance. Talk therapy seems to be the only support easily offered. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Exposure Response Prevention therapy for OCD are not readily available unless you have a lot of money to pay out of pocket. It is also extremely difficult to find th erapists that do these therapies. Mindfulness could be included in the school day to help students with stress. \" \"Covid has been devastating for this age group.

As indicated through their free response, the lack of affordable housing coupled with limited income presents a very real threat to this age group. \"As more and more children are in the throes of houselessness, all the abo ve problems need to be addressed NOW not one year from now! Policies set in place. Yes, that is difficult but mandatory if there is to be a push on the needle towards success.\" \"A lot of transition aged youth are working but have limited income and can't a fford housing in the area, I've known a few that had to live in a vehicle.

A review of the free response answers, however, reveals that this concern is coupled with a desire to utilize programs such t he collaborative courts to help these young people avoid potentially deleterious interactions within the traditional criminal justice system. As their responses indicate, respondents posit that the ready availability and accessibility of such programs is a critical step in addressing substance use and abuse for this age group. \"The collaborative courts are absolutely essential to helping system -involved TAY adults in Alameda County. The work they do to help people avoid the ongoing cycle of incarceration is invaluable - especially so early in adulthood. So many of the individuals they work with struggle with mental health and/or substance use concerns.

The collaborative courts help those with substance use and mental health issues to address these issues and achieve stability and sobriety. The collaborative courts can also assist with housing, education, and employment resources. Completion of a collaborative court program can also lead to charges being dismissed or removed from their record which also helps them to move forward in life. \" \"Substance abusers need lots of help to turn habit.

Appointment availability X X Barriers to Accessing Mental Health Services The survey participants' concerns can be distilled as such: resources, ranging from basic need such as food and housing to behavioral and mental healthcare treatment, are in short supply. If these resources are somehow available, then accessing them can be an arduous and difficult process. Their responses speak to an overloaded, unfriendly system that does not currently meet their needs; they also speak to a desire for a more friendly, efficient, and transparent method to access care. \"No beds, can't navi gate a system that has no boats. Need to double the number of beds at Villa and at the units at John George, and take money out of Santa Rita to do that.\" \"Difficulty getting connected to services, change in providers once connected. Who to contact and how to get connected to different teams. More outreach efforts required, can be difficult to reach people via phone.\" \"The difficulty navigating systems prevents people from going and the way people are disrespected when accessing services.\" \"Cost - many prov iders are not accepting insurance. Also, many sites have you talk to 3 -4 people before meeting your clinician, this commonly results in re -traumatization, frustration, and hopelessness.\" \"Provider follow through, provider availability during evenings/night s/weekends/holidays; more responsive system and less hoops to go through (e.g. enhance 211).\" Current Programs A majority of MHSA funded programs across CSS and PEI incorporate wrap around services to address basic need s and support with resource navigati on.

Such groups would leverage their relationships with local communities to better advocate for mental health service advocacy, education, and access. Many of the responses indicated that developing a sustainable funding pipeline would be a vital step in developing and maintain these programs. Additionally, these suggestions reflect a desire to fill the program workers from within the population they serve. There are also proposals to create relationships between existing service providers \u2014 such as clinicians and community benefit organizations \u2014 and the communities that they serve. \"More long -term funding for nonprofit and community organizations who are already providing these services to improve quality and quantity.

We aim to involve the community at every level of programming, from program development with consumers and se rvice providers at the time of contracting, to developing program goals and objectives, evaluation metrics, and program improvements. The County is currently evaluating public input presented during the CPPP and 30 -Day Public Comment periods. These discu ssions have been narrowed to a number of possible activities and are summarized in the Summary of Changes section of the FY2 3/26 MHSA Three -Year Plan which is publicly available at https://acmhsa.org. All community need i nformation is shared with the ACBH Leadership and analyzed against the known budget information. After this review, the ACBH Director makes the final decisions on how to move forward with any new or expansion programming. Alameda County looks forward to w orking collaboratively with the community to uncover additional recommendations to further strengthen and enhance the mental health system of care.

PAIGE staff began working with this young woman in late 2020 ; she struggled with severe PTSD and multiple attempts of suicide since childhood. She had been admitte d to psychiatric hospitals well over 20 times since 2013. When opened with PAIGE, she had difficulties meeting with staff for long periods as she struggled with symptoms of social anxiety, hypervigilance, and overwhelm. She experienced extreme isolation and difficulty with being out in the community on her own, leaving her bedroom due to fear of bumping into roommates, and daily suicidal ideation. The PAIGE team engaged her at a slow pace to ensure she felt safe and comfortable to express herself and engage in treatment. She was slowly introduced to more staff members who engaged her in creative activities to build rapport. Throughout the course of treatment, she exhibited courage and pushed herself out of her comfort zone countless times to engage in groups , social events, and has done tremendous work around processing her trauma. She is extremely insightful, motivated to be engaged in her treatment, and one of the biggest accomplishments this year was completing a vocational program and internship to purs ue her career as a vet assistant. She was able to identify hope for her future and is also now in a healthy relationship.

Please Describe Ways that the Program Strives to: a.Reduce Mental Health Stigma: Our program works to reduce stigma related to mental health by providing services on our clients' terms - in the community and during flexibl e times to meet the needs of our children and families. We work very hard to focus on the families' goals for services and build relationships through the delivery of practical/tangible support (financial, transportation, etc.). For some families, we provi de a Family Partner who has personally experienced challenges with their own children (CPS, IEPs, etc.) in ordert to validate the caregivers' experiences and show them that receiving mental health support is valuable. b.Create a Welcoming Environment: In order to create a welcoming environment, we work to meet families where they are most comfortable - in their own home, at a public park, or a coffee shop. We regularly offer to bring food to appointments in order to create a sense of community and safety. We strive to have a diverse staff team in order to be able to reflect the diversity of our client population. Our staff works to talk openly about issues of difference, systemic oppression, and to validate the experiences of our often marginalized children an d families. Since COVID 19, we have worked to create systems to continue to offer service as often as possible in a way thatCOMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES114 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGworks for families. Throughout the pandemic, we have continued to offer in person meetings at a family's preferred location as lo ng as we are able to do so safely. III. Language Capacity for this Program: We provide services in the families' preferred language. This year, we served 19 English- speaking families and 4 Spanish -speaking families. IV. FY 21/22 challenges: As we continue to navigate through the COVID 19 pandemic, we worked very hard to conduct 90% or more of our services in person. This proved challenging during times of COVID spikes and we quickly had to pivot back to virtual services. For some families, that continued to be challenging. We worked hard to get our clients re -engaged in school, in person. This proved to be challenging because many of our clients had never been to school in person. Additionally, finding qualified and talented staff to fill vacancies was challenging. As an agency we have worked hard to recruit and retain our staff by increasing base wages wherever we can and emphasizing wellness and sustainability in this work. Is anyone better off? V. FY 21/22 Client Impact: Here are two stories submitted by our Care Coordinators that highlight some of the interventions provided by Connections and the successes the youth and family were able to achieve during the course of treatment. (Clients' names have been changed to protect identit y.) We received a referral for a 6 -year- old boy named \"Tice\" who had experienced significant early trauma and attachment disruptions. His biological parents struggled with addiction and mental health diagnoses. He was being cared for by his maternal grand mother who struggled greatly to cope with his intense behaviors which included destroying things in the home, leaving the house unsupervised, making verbal threats, and expressing suicidal ideation. He exhibited aggression and dysregulation while at school and had been kept in a psychiatric hospital for a week prior to being referred to our program. At the time of referral, his grandmother regularly made verbal threats to \"give him up\" and would call the police when he acted out. Our care coordinator imme diately began to develop a team of professional and natural supports to help Tice and his grandmother. They conducted regular meetings with the school staff, school therapist, Kinship therapist, grandmother, and several other family members. We also helped the primary therapist to make a referral to TBS to ensure even greater support for Tice's daily needs. Our WRAP support counselor worked closely with the TBS coach and school staff to develop interventions for Tice, including teaching him coping skills, p racticing skills in triggering situations, increasing self -esteem, and increasing Tice's ability to accept limits and use social skills. Our support counselor worked with Tice in the home with his caregiver and siblings, as well as at school. Our care coor dinator worked with other professionals to support Tice's grandmother with strategies to use in the home and provided psycho -education about trauma and attachment. Tice's grandmother utilized our crisis phone several times to receive coaching and support w hen struggling with Tice's behaviors. Although Tice continues to struggle with some dysregulating moments, reports from his grandmother and school staff indicate that he is much more successful at accepting limits and using coping skills. His grandmother no longer threatens to give him up and he appears much more secure at home. His oldest adult sister and her partner provide daily support to his grandmother which has relieved grandmother's stress and helped Tice feel more connected and supported by famil y. He expresses pride in being the \"man of the house\" and expresses motivation to help his grandmother. Tice has not been hospitalized for COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES115 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGover a year and his grandmother has not needed the crisis line in several months. We are working on a sustainability plan with Tice's grandmother to help her envision what she has learned and how she can continue to receive support when WRAP service close. We received a referral for a 4 -year- old girl named \"Naomi\" who was struggling significantly with transitions to her preschool placement. During drop -off, Naomi would scream, thrash, bite, scratch, and spit on her mother and school staff in an attempt not to separate from her mother. School staff described her as being terrified and the stress experienced by Naomi's mot her decreased the consistency of Naomi's attendance at school. Naomi's mother was very young and had three other children all under the age of 8 years. Naomi and her family experienced homelessness during the first 2.5 years of Naomi's life, moving from shelters to families' homes without any stability or predictability. Our care coordinator worked with the preschool staff and Naomi's family to develop some targeted strategies to support Naomi's transitions, including trying to have a preferred staff meet her in the mornings, providing her with space away from others and preferred activities/comfort objects to use when upset, and creating two different social stories to support Naomi's transitions. One book was focused on the teachers, friends, and routine s that Naomi had at school. This book reinforced that her family thought about her during the school day and would always come back to get her at the end of the day. The second book was a family book devoted to photos of Naomi with her immediate family an d large extended family to reinforce how many people love and care for Naomi. Regular team meetings with school staff, Naomi's mother, grandmother, and aunties helped the team focus on how to support Naomi feel secure and Naomi's mother to increase predict ability and consistency at home. The care coordinator also worked weekly one -on-one with Naomi to identify and practice coping skills, develop feeling language and communication skills, and navigate peer interactions. The care coordinator worked one -on-one weekly with Naomi's mother to develop organizational strategies (visual calendar, using a planner, chore charts) and on being the parent that Naomi's mother really wanted to be, which included validating her children's feelings, rewarding positive behav iors, and doing things as a family. The care coordinator worked with Naomi's mother to identify practical challenges, such as transportation, a working phone, and financial stresses, using ancillary funds to address immediate needs and to consider how to meet the needs once WRAP closes. Naomi has been much more successful at school and is able to transition safely without throwing tantrums. Although Naomi's mother still struggles to cope with the needs of all her children, she is working to implement more structure in the home and we are currently preparing for Naomi to start Kindergarten.

Please Describe Ways that the Program Strives to: a.Reduce Mental Health Stigma: Our Parent Partner and our Youth Partner are staff with lived experience . As they partner with and support the youth and families referred, they share some of their own stories about struggling with, addressing, and learning to meet their goals despite having /or having a child with a mental health disability . This help s to de-stigmatize mental health and foster hope for youth and families . b.Create a Welcoming Environment: By having a multi -racial and gendered team with different life experiences, education, skills and abilities, this help s to create a welcoming environment for youth and families , however they identify. Staff are trained in using a trauma -informed approach and are skilled at implementing family engagement strategies . They work to meet with youth and families at times and locations that are most convenient for the youth and family. III. Language Capacity for this Program: The Parent Partner is bi -lingual Spanish speaking. IV. FY 21/22 challenges: Challenges for this year included the Covid -19 pandemic, staffing and documentation . While the staff team is very flexible and adapted quickly to a hybrid service delivery model , delivering telehealth services when Covid rates spike or a family/youth/staff tested positive for Covid, we have found that overall with this population in -person services are very much needed. The pandemic has also caused a workforce shortage and this year there has been staff turnover and unfilled positions. Cu rrenly we are working to hire a Clinc al Supervisor who left in May . Lastly, the documentation demands of Medi -Cal can be time consuming and take away from service delivery time ,COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES118 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGparticularly for the Care Coordinators . Some of the upcoming documentation reductions as a result of CalAIM should help staff spend less time on paperwork and more time meet ing with youth and families . Is anyone better off? V. FY 21/22 Client Impact: In survey s parents/caregivers have shared how much they have felt supported as a family with the wraparound services. The program is meeting bench marks for the number of monthly services and response /follow up to crisis. Here are some examples of client impact: A 17-year- old African American young man was homeless with his mother when services began. He struggled with psychosis and was inconsistent with his medication. The wrap team worked with the family to find stable housing in San Leandro and helped him then enroll in high school . With these life changes he was able to stabilize and then transitioned to TA Y services after he turned 18. A 16 -year- old Latino young man with a history of trauma was referred when he was struggling during the pandemic, not attending school, sneaking out, beco ming involved in stealing and other illegal activity . He was living with his grandparents. The wrap team partnered with the family to help the grandparents feel less overwhemed and t o support the youth to get the needed supports at school and into extracurricular activities like boxing . Through wrap services, he learned to use healthier outlets for his anger and to develop goals for the future. A 15 -year- old African American young woman was referred for services due to her running away and havin g suicical thoughts and behaviors while living with her mother . Her mother was struggling with substance abuse and that was triggering her daughter's sense of safety. Through a series of Child & Family Team meetings and collaboration with the staff team and family, a decision was made for the young woman to move into a home with her aunt. The mother was in support of this plan. Once in a more stable living environment, the young woman's behaviors decreased , she wasn't experiencing sucicidal ideation or running away , and she started to improve at school and to develop health y peer relationships. VI.FY 21/22 Additional Information: Fred Finch Youth & Family Services is continuing to implement the Racial Equity Initiative and this is a priority for the agency. We currently have staff participate in racial affinity groups to learn more about privilege for White-identified staff and to help provide a voice for staff who identify as BIPOC. East Bay Wrap staff use individual and group supervision as well as staff meetings and trainings to discuss and address issues of culture and to ensure the delivery of culturally responsive services. VII. FY 22/23 Projections of Clients to be Served: We are contracte d to serve 20 youth concurrently. We currently have a new Care Coordinator and an opening for a Clinical Super visor who carries half a caseload so there are only 13 youth open.

The majority of services are provided in the community. The program provides clinical case management, crisis intervention, individual rehab, peer mentoring, medication management, IPS employment support, housing assistance, col lateral support for families, and skill building and socialization groups. Target Population: The STAY Program target group is Transition Age Youth ages 18 to 24 with serious mental health conditions. How Much Did We Do? I. FY 21/22: a.Number of Unique Clients Served: 71. Cost per client: $ $41,817 How Well Did We Do? II. Please Describe Ways that the Program Strives to: a.Reduce Mental Health Stigma: All staff are trained in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for psychosis, and one large component of this strategy is to destigmatize psychosis through direct support to participants. The program's value of person -centered language , prioritizing the stated preferences of the participants themselves , and collaborating to create goals and set priorities helps to destigmatize mental health support access as it reduces reliance on traditional systems which may prescribe a one -size-fits-all approach. The program completes outreach and engagement to family supports and loved ones as well as the participants' themselves, providing psychoeducation abo ut mental health, and supporting with skills building as it relates to addressing mental health needs in the home and engaging in crisis management. b.Create a Welcoming Environment: The STAY facility has an open -door policy for participants and encourages participants to come to campus to rest and recuperate. There is a 'participant room' with couches and hygiene supplies for participants in the office space. STAY utilizes flexible funding to increase access to wellness opportunities, enjoy meals, and celebrate accomplishments, particularly when someone has a work, school, or housing milestone, or to celebrate anniversaries and birthdays with participants. III. Language Capacity for this Program: English is the primary language for most program participa nts, but we have participants who are monolingual in Spanish and Punjabi. One bilingual Spanish -speaking Peer Mentor and one bilingual Spanish -speaking Clinical Supervisor remained on staff. When in collaboration with participants and families telehealth a nd language line interpreters were involved. IV. FY 21/22 challenges: Hiring: The STAY team has been understaffed for all of F Y21-22. For most of the year, the team had the following staffing : 4 of 7 Clinicians, 1 of 2 Employment Specialists, 2 of 2 PeerCOMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES122 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGMentors, 0.4 of 1 Family Partner, 0.5 of 1 Registered Nurse, 0.5 of 1 medication provider . Also, during multiple occurrences in the last year, during stretches of time of three weeks or more, at least three staff were on extended leave, impacting the level of services the team were able to provide to participants. In FY 20 -21, there were more applicants for non -clinical positions than clinical positions, which impacted the programs' capacity to fill important positions which provide case management to participants. In order to creatively address staffing, STAY will be filling case manager positions with a combination of B achelors, Masters, and pre -licensed case managers. Housing: Participants in STAY are often experiencing acute mental health crises, and the current system of Coordinated Entry, in which a participant must complete an often hours -long interview , creates a barrier for participants to access this resource. Multiple participants in the program do not access shelter or other forms of housing until they are stable enough in their symptoms to be able to complete the required forms and interviews. COVID restrictions: Although there has been no stay at home orders in the FY 21 -22 year, certain placements frequently accessed by STAY participants , such as hospitals, jails, sub -acute placements, and shelters, have had to take measures to reduce spread of COVID during outbreaks. This has impacted the STAY teams' ability to meet with participants in these placements and continue work on case management task s. Also, when shelters have had outbreaks, they have had to limit the number of intakes, thus impacting participants' available housing opportunities. Extended/Delayed Discharges: Referrals to adult system of care and coordinating with next providers were delayed at times, impacting participant outcomes and capacity to bring on new participants. The reasons being that the new provider was unable to take on the participant in a timely manner, medication provider appointment was not set, participant was diff icult to locate, referral was not done in final quarter prior to 25th birthday. Is anyone better off? V. FY 21/22 Client Impact: \"Improve the ability of clients to secure and maintain stable permanent housing in the least restrictive and most integrated l iving situation appropriate to meet their needs and preferences\" - While the ultimate goal is to secure permanent housing, i n the current housing climate of the Bay Area, STAY continues to be creative in helping to secure and maintain housing for participa nts in the program. In the last year, between 52 and 65% of participants in any given month had been in a stable living situation for at least three months. These include usage of family and loved ones supports, shared housing, longer -term transitional hou sing, board and cares, and various treatment facilities. \"Reduce client hospitalizations and utilization of emergency health care services for mental health and physical health issues\" - The STAY program was able to support reduction of hospitalization fo r 81% of participants in the program in FY 21 -22. Strategies for doing so are targeting the symptoms and resources which promote mental health crisis through education, coaching, modeling, and psychotherapy. The team also collaborates with family members t o increase their awareness of presentations which meet criteria for 5150 hold and promote least invasive mental health environments and resources when someone is subthreshold for psychiatric hospitalization. STAY also increases contact with participants wh o present with increased risk, which often helps to reduce likelihood of going to the hospital. Extensive safety planning is done with all participants who are at risk of hospitalization due to harm to self, others, or grave disability. COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES123 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG\"Connect clients w ith ongoing primary healthcare services and coordinate healthcare services with clients' primary care providers\" - The STAY program was able to connect 67% of eligible participants to primary care providers in FY 21 -22. When a participant comes in without an identified provider, linkage is offered and attempted, and steps are taken to attempt to reduce barriers to connecting to primary care. These include working through anxiety management and trauma -response as it relates to medical settings, increasing sk ills in transportation, increasing awareness of physical health and wellness, and using motivational interviewing to address motivation and interviewing as it relates. Personal Client Story: Over the course of the last year, one participant, who was initi ally referred to the program from an early psychosis program and was attending school, had a relapse of mental health experiences, housing insecurity, and stopped college . Through ongoing services around stabilization, linkage, and CBT for psychosis, this participant was able to set appropriate and health boundaries with family members, re -engage in own mental health recovery, reduce hospitalizations, and return back to school. This fall, due to the work in FY 21 -22, this participant is prepared to move in to campus housing and resume their studies at university. VI. FY 21/22 Additional Information: The projection of clients for FY 21/22 is related to staff and hiring opportunities over the course of the next year. In order to increase program caseload size , the program will have to complete 2 intakes for every 1 discharge, and clinician hiring impacts the ability to complete intakes, assessments, and treatment plans across the program. VII.Projections of Clients to be Served: The ACT Clinician role (previously 7 FTE) will now be set up with a combination of BBS -registered ACT Clinicians, Masters -level non -BBS registered Mental Health Counselors, and Bachelor- level Care Facilitators. Each participant will be assigned a clinician to provide guidance for care interventions, crisis management, and annual clinical assessments and a case manager who will be responsible for regular linkage and care facilitation. This change in staffing will hopefully help in crease staffing in the case manager role so that more participants may be served in the program. Participants will have a case manager to address immediate needs, and when the need arises for traditional therapy in addition to case management and care faci litation, an assigned clinician will be able to meet more regularly with them for this purpose. In order to streamline bringing referred participants into the program, the Lead Clinician became the Referral Coordinator for STAY in FY 21 -22. Within two day s of referral, this person contacts referral source, gathers information about best ways to engage, and attempts to schedule intake. They also complete most intakes for the STAY program . It is likely that this strategy has helped to increase the annual cli ent number from 67 in FY 20 -21 to 71 in FY 21 -22. The Family Partner role (previously filled by 0.4 FTE) has been combined with the Care Facilitator role for a full -time direct care position. Part of the caseload for this person will be specifically for t he purpose of providing services to families and loved ones as well as providing direct case management and care facilitation directly to participants themsel ves.

Clients shall be those individuals at high risk of re -hospitalization who could live in the community if comprehensive services and con centrated supports were available to accommodate their needs. Target Population: Clients will include TAY individuals who are homeless or at risk of homelessness, have been involved in the criminal justice system, have co -occurring substance use and / or p hysical health disorders, frequently use hospitals and other emergency services, are at risk of institutionalization, and / or have limited English proficiency. Contractor shall serve individuals who are sex offenders. How Much Did We Do? I.FY 21/22: a.Number of Unique Clients Served: 65. Cost per client: $22,838. How Well Did We Do? II. Please Describe Ways that the Program Strives to: a.Reduce Mental Health Stigma: PAIGE team uses a client -centered approach to meet partners where they are at in terms of stage in their recovery and normalize their experiences. We ensure that treatment goals are developed collaboratively and we value our partner's autonomy to make decisions for themselves. Team provides psychoeducation and works collaboratively with families and their natural support s to improve understanding of mental health challenges and develop strategies to better support their loved ones. One way we do this is by connecting them to family resources such as FERC and NAMI. We also encourage TAY to link to resources in the communit y such as peer groups to reduce stigma and increase social supports as part of their recovery. b.Create a Welcoming Environment: The PAIGE team values respect and the comfortability and safety of our partners. PAIGE is flexible and offers services in setting s where participants feel most comfortable such as in their home, at the park, the office, of their preferred location in the community. Team takes safety precautions for COVID -19 and have provided PPE to our participants throughout the pandemic. PAIGE al so offers telehealth visits including psychiatry through MS teams for partners who do not feel comfortable or safe meeting in person due to COVID -19 risks. PAIGE team members practice a person -centered approach and utilize Harm - Reduction and Trauma -Informe d Care principles to meet the participant where they are at and to allow a safe place for self -expression. PAIGE also embodies a multicultural approach as a we serve a diverse population and understand the importance of how cultural aspects may influence m ental health, especially when working with families . III. Language Capacity for this Program: Spanish, English, a nd a ccess to the county Language Line.COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES126 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGIV. FY 21/22 challenges: PAIGE team experienced increased staff turnover rates and low staff capacity this FY year, in addition to staff periodically missing work due to COVID -19. PAIGE team onboarded total of 4 new staff members, 3 who joined in the second half of the FY. Team experienced challenges with onboarding/training new staffing, supporting staf f adapt to new work environment, and focusing on strengthening team culture to reduce turnover rates. Another challenge for PAIGE was balancing a large caseload with low staff capacity and ensuring partners were still being seen at least 4 times a month. Team did well in utilizing ACT meetings to track visits with partners and prioritizing those in acute crisis. However due to short staffing, PAIGE endured challenges with street outreach to partners experiencing homelessness or those who have patterns of de clining services. These are partners who often need the most support but can be difficult to locate or engage. Team also experienced periodic challenges with outreaching to partners in in/out of county jail and inpatient psychiatric facilities as result of COVID -19 outbreaks, lockdown of facilities as well as technical difficulties with video visits. Despite these barriers, team did well with collaborating with providers to develop discharge plans to prepare and support partners for reentry into the community. Is anyone better off? V. FY 21/22 Client Impact: Many of our partners are isolated, lack social and natur al supports, and identify PAIGE team as an important resource and support they can depend on during their worst moments. PAIGE team participants have endured, overcome a lot of challenges, and several have made progress in their recovery in the past year i ncluding at least 4 who graduated to a lower level of care. Majority of partners were seen regularly by our psychiatrist this year as we have been able to offer telehealth visits, which increases accessibility for our partners who struggle with severe isol ation and difficulties meeting at the clinic or office. Through IPS services, many of partners obtained competitive employment and enrolled into school for GED, vocational programs, or college courses. During this FY we have also observed reduced number of re-hospitalizations and improvement with drawing in families and natural supports as vital contributors to their treatment. Team has also been able to increase social events and support groups for our partners to increase their peer network as more barrie rs have been reduced around COVID -19 regulations. This allows the team to continue develop creative engagement strategies, for example we had an Oakland A's baseball outing for our partners and their families, which allowed them a space to foster a connect ion in their community. One success story is about a 20 -year -old participant who we began serving in late 2020 who struggled with severe PTSD and multiple attempts of suicide since childhood. She had been admitted to psychiatric hospitals well over 20 times since 2013. When opened with PAIGE, she had difficulties meeting with staff for long periods as she struggled with symptoms of social anxiety, hypervigilance, and overwhelm. She experienced extreme isolation and difficulty with being out in the commu nity on her own, leaving her bedroom due to fear of bumping into roommates, and daily suicidal ideation. PAIGE team engaged her at a slow pace to ensure partner felt safe and comfortable to express herself and engage in treatment. We slowly introduced her to more staff members and engaged her in creative activities to build rapport. Throughout the course of treatment, she exhibited courage and pushed herself out of her comfort zone countless times to engage in groups, social events, and has done tremendous work around processing her trauma. She is extremely insightful, motivated to be engaged in her treatment, and one of the biggest accomplishments this year was completing a vocational program COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES127 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGand internship to pursue her career as a vet assistant. She was a ble to identify hope for her future and is also now in a healthy relationship. VI.FY 21/22 Additional Information: PAIGE team members biggest strength is their comradery, work ethic, and passion for serving our TAY group. We have been successful at implementing an efficient style of collaboration using the ACT model which can be observed during our daily meetings to ensure team is following up on important tasks, that our partners are being met at least 2 times a week, and prioritizing those who are in acute crisis. Team works cohesively and eager to jump in to support partners and their colleagues. VII.Projections of Clients to be Served: Service Changes: Paige team would like to focus on increasing the facilitation of team decision meetings (TDMs). Due to challenges with low staffing, onboarding and ongoing pandemic regulations, PAIGE did not provide TDMs as often as we would have liked. PAIGE team would also like to focus on supporting our partners who struggle with homelessness or housing stability to connect to coordinated entry and help them become \"doc ready\" such as making sure they have a copy of their ID, social security card, verification of income, and verification of homelessness. We would also like to focus on scheduling at least 1 social and peer group each month and develop monthly calendar with events and resources to share to participants to encourage building connections in the community.

One success story to note is a participant who was working with our team for 4+ years. When participant was referred to Greater HOPE, they were experiencing significant mental health symptoms and presented as very unstable in the community, and a high utilizer of local emergency services. Through help of team and wrap around services, participant has been able to gain insight into his mental health, become stable on medication and also is employed at this time.

Together these investments focus on achieving the following core goals: 1.Increase the availabilit y of a range of affordable housing options with appropriate supportive services so that individuals with a serious mental illness and their families can choose, get, and keep their preferred type of housing arrangement; 2.Minimize the time individuals wit h a serious mental illness spend living in institutional settings by increasing and improving working relationships among housing and service providers, family members, and consumers; 3.Track and monitor the type, quantity, and quality of housing utilized by and available to ACBH target populations; 4.Provide centralized information and resources related to housing for ACBH consumers, family members, and providers; 5.Coordinate educational and training programs around housing and related services issues for consumers, family members, and providers; 6.Work toward the prevention and elimination of homelessness in Alameda County. Target Population: MHSA funded programs under the OHCC focus on helping individuals with serious mental illness in Alameda County to live in the least restrictive and most integrated setting appropriate to meet their needs. OHCC efforts focus primarily, but not exclusively, on helping individuals experiencing homelessness and those with prolonged stays in institutional settings. Specific program categories that operate under the OHCC include: 1)Long- term housing subsidy programs and housing partnership support contracts that make it possible for individuals with serious mental illness to live in permanent supportive housing and licensed board and cares; 2)Short -term housing financial assistance to help individuals with serious mental illness to obtain and maintain housing with one -time and short -term payments of security deposits and rent; 3)Supportive services linked with permanent subsidized housing to create \"permanent supportive housing\" options for individuals to live in community -based rental housing settings; 4)Temporary housing programs for individuals with serious mental illness experiencing homelessness to be sheltered and supported while they work to return to permanent housing; 5)Street outreach and housing navigation services focused on helping homeless individuals with serious mental illness living in public places and emergency shelters to return to permanent, safe, and supportive housing as quickly as possible;COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES138 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG6)Supporting an affordable housing search website and news alerts related to current housing opportunities relevant to people with serious mental illness and extremely low incomes; 7)Referrals, coordination, clinical consultation, training, and oversight of a network of more than 450 licensed board and care and permanent support housing slots countywide ; 8)Housing education and counseling sessions at ACBH- funded Wellness Centers and other community locations; 9)Landlord Liaison Program recruits and works with landlords and property managers in the private rental market settings to acquire safe, decent and affordable housing countywide and retain units securing long-term housing for clients who have previously had barriers to locating affordable housing or maintaining long term tenancy; 10) Staff involvement and financial support toward countywide efforts focused on addressing hom elessness; 11) MHSA affordable housing project application preparation in partnership with nonprofit affordable housing developers. Coordinated Entry System: The County's Coordinated Entry System (CES) for addressing homelessness, formalized in 2017, underwent planning and transitions to an updated system intended to improve provision of services and prioritize of need. These changes were a result of extensive stak eholder feedback, alignment with System Modeling efforts, and improved efforts to reduce racial inequity in homelessness. Continued collaboration and coordination will be needed to ensure the maximum effectiveness of CES. Much larger investments in affordable and supportive housing are needed by multiple levels of government to ensure individuals with serious mental illness have a place to call home. No Place Like Home (NPLH): The OHCC worked collaboratively with cities, other county departments, and affordable housing developers to secure $ 65 million from the statewide No Place Like Home (NPLH) Program (Round 4 funds) for creating more supportive housing for homeless individuals with a serious mental illness. This funding will help create and support 1 99 new housing units set aside for the target population in buildings with 553 total affordable units. Counties must commit to providing supportive services to NPLH tenants for a minimum of 20 years. Each project will have rents restricted as affordable to the NPLH target population for a minimum of 55 years. This allocation is in addition to the $ 129 million round 1 -3 allocation s. In total, 562 NPLH units will be added within Alameda County and will support expansion of units dedicated to those experienci ng homelessness and SMI. How Much Did We Do? I. FY 21/22: Data reflected in individual program summaries FY 2 1/22 challenges: The pandemic continued to add challenges to those experiencing homelessness and serious mental illness and accompanying household members. Due to risk mitigation efforts, temporary shelters operated within decompressed capacity limits to support social dis tancing and health measures. Additional on- going challenges facing include rapidly rising costs of housing within the County. The number of individuals experiencing homelessness has increased over 20% between 2019 and 2022 with an estimate of over 9,747 pe ople experiencing homelessness on any given night (Alameda County 2022 Point -In-Time Count Summary ). The costs of housing impacts many of our service providers and their staff who cannot afford to live in the community where they work.

Is anyone better off? V. FY 21/22 Client Impact: \"Jasmine\" is a 62 -year -old, AA female, referred to STRIDES in 2010. She has had 30 + years history of psychiatric (acute and subacute) and medical hospitalizations within Alameda County. In 2020 -2021, Jasmine's physical health deterioriated significantly. She was diagnosed with renal failure and kidney disease, with a recommendation by P CP and medical hospitals for 3x/week dialysis treatments. Jasmine was highly paranoid about medical treatment, not adherent to psychiatric medications to manage her psychosis symptoms, continued to engage in illicit drug use, and consistently refused psych /medical care. Our only resolution was to strongly encourage/support her to Highland Hospital Emergency Department for acute dialysis treatment approximately once every two weeks - which was what she tolerated and only sometimes agreed to, and which was no t anywhere near the level of treatment she needed for the severity of her medical condition. Ultimately, this led to life - threatening complications and an extensive medical hospitalization between Nov 2021 - Feb 2022 for stabilization. Upon discharge, STRI DES supported her transition to Assisted Care Living home (for which we supplement her housing rent using MHSA housing funds). Since the transition there, Jasmine has consistently engaged with treatment team visits multiple times per week, during which we provided extensive support to 3x/week dialysis treatments, along with scheduled outings throughout the week to further reward her engagement in medical care. Currently, she has demonstrated improved insight and strong motivation to manage her medical care condition and attend all treatment appointments, has been in recovery from substance use, and has had no psychiatric or medical rehospitalizations.

Please Describe Ways that the Program Strives to: a.Reduce Mental Health Stigma: HEAT works with participants by using a client -centered approach to collaborate with their families and /or any natural supports to meet participants where th ey are at in terms of recovery, insight, and ability to manage symptoms. HEAT provides psychoeducation to famili es and other natural supports to support them in being part of the treatment team to help their loved ones, provide linkage support to receive m uch needed support (NAMI, Towne House Wellness Center, HEDCO Wellness Center ). As part of the HEAT service model the participant's natural supports are drawn in as stakeholders in their care and contributors to the treatment. This Wraparound approach suppo rts building community around the participant and empowers their voice and choice while reducing the isolation that so frequently accompanies severe mental health challenges. b.Create a Welcoming Environment: HEAT is flexible in location, meeting time, and engagement style to support participants and natural supports to feel comfortable in a wide range of settings. The HEAT meet s with participants at parks, their homes, any one of our wellness centers or other BACS locations, or anywhere in the community that they prefer. HEAT ensures safety by taking steps during COVID -19 to both wear and provide PPE to participants during meetings and take temperatures before entering buildings. HEAT staff are trained in Crisis De - escalation, Harm -Reduction and Trauma -Informed Care principles to meet the participant where they are at in a whole -person manner. Cultural responsivity is a core axiom of the care provided by the team as the HEAT team was designed with Culturally an d Linguistically Appropriate Services (CLAS) standards in mind.COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES171 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGIII. Language Capacity for this Program: Spanish , English, access to the county Language Line. IV. FY 2 1/22 challenges: As the pandemic continued into this year, HEAT continued to go above a nd beyond to meet participants in the community, at the wellness centers, and via digital platforms to ensure their needs were being met. One of the biggest challenges continued to be accessing and outreaching in psychiatric care settings and jail. Histori cally locked settings are an opportunity for intensive engagement and trust building to prepare for reentry and support in the community. However, this year continued to have some barriers to outreach and engagement efforts with many facilities going into lockdown due to COVID -19 outbreaks ; though HEAT team was able to use unique and collaborative strategies to continue to meet our partners where they were at in their recovery and goals. Another challenge was low staffing on HEAT. The COVID -19 Pandemic greatly impacted our staffing, which impacted HEAT's ability to engage with all HEAT partners at least 4x a month. However, the HEAT Team began to strategize and staff began meeting with folks in the same area on the same day to maximize their time and outreach attempts . The HEAT team also had the addition of several new staff who were experienced in the field and from the community, which helped with partners' engagement. Is anone better off? V. FY 2 1/22 Client Impact: HEAT participants have overcome a lot in the past year. Entering into another year of the pandemic, participants identified HEAT as one of the few resources they could continue to rely on during the ongoing pandemic chaos. The pandemic incr eased barriers to resources folks previously connected to independently ; such as : social services, DMV , social security , food pantries, and employment resources . HEAT team was able to minimize barriers and enroll/transfer Medi -Cal, SSI, and access to DMV s ervices for participants, whe n they were otherwise unable to follow through. Primary care and medication management were also great accomplishments of HEAT this year \u2014with many clinics struggling with staffing shortages due to the increase in COVID -related illnesses, HEAT was able to offer advocacy, support, collaboration, and medication services to ensure participant needs were addressed. HEAT had a truly monumental success story this year. This participant was originally from San Diego and in her mid -late 60's when we began to outreach her in 2019. Sh e struggled managing psycho tic symptoms, she was homeles s in Alameda , and was in and out of John George. The team had outreached her several times in the community only to be met with hostility and aggression. Eventually she was referred to Villa where the team had an opportunity to build rapport with her ; with some patience, she finally agreed to services with HEAT. She spent the better half of her 3 years with the team working on getting her benefits, housing, and staying on her medications. She eventually was awarded SSI, moved into a licensed board and care and all psychotic symptoms, hostility, and aggression co mpletely went away. She then began focusing on bigger goals: reconnecting with her family in San Diego. She spent over 10 years without any contact with her sister and elderly mother. With some patience and a lot of help from HEAT , she was able to locate a nd reunite via phone with her sister in San Diego. She was informed that her mother was battling a lot of different medical issues , which then sparked her new goal to move down to San Diego to be close to her family. During this period, though it came with some added stressors, this partner was able to stay on medications and continue managing her symptoms successfully; in fact, when she discharged from Villa, she never went back to JGP, CSU, or a CRT. This partner was a fierce advocate for her move and wor ked collaboratively with the HEAT staff in figuring out how to make the move happen. It was with great pleasure that the HEAT team was able to transfer her Medi -Cal, her sub -payee, find her a new board and care down the street from her sister in San COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES172 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGDieg o, and connect her with a new case management team. This partner's success does not end at her move to San Diego to be close to her mom and her sister; she often stated that she felt like herself again after finding the right medication regiment and sticking with it was made her goals a reality. Overall HEAT reduced the number of partners that were re -hospitalized, by providing wraparound services 7 days a week with a passionate and dedicated team. HEAT exemplifies what it means to provide collaborative wrap around care, coordinating with family, friends, landlords, hospitals, and clinics from the start of services with participants and timely in the event of crisis or support needs. The Wellness Centers have also been an asset to the team, working closing wit h the wellness center staff to link participants and their families to the support resources they are interested in. As COVID -19 regulations begin to lift, HEAT has supported participants in accessing vaccines, covid tests, and began to offer groups for pa rticipants to support with their symptoms/symptom management . HEAT recently had a field trip to an A's game where participants were invited to attend in order to enhance the ir connection to the community. VI.FY 21/22 Additional Information: HEAT had some fluctuations in staff during this year. HEAT was able to continue supporting 125+ participants. The team was able to onboard, train, and integrate new staff utilizing the opportunity to reengage participants that had been struggling to meet. HEAT has great comradery as a program and all members are passionate about serving adults with severe mental illness and homelessness and embracing the Whatever it Takes model. HEAT is collaborative and supportive of one another and the partners we serve and has been able to successfully implement the daily schedule in ACT model, ensuring participants meet with 2-5 different staff monthly, and typically no less than 1 meeting a week. The team is not afraid to step in or step up when needed and the participant outcomes demonstrate this success. VII. Projections of Clients to be Served: FY Programs Service Changes: HEAT would like to increase the number of visits clients receive per month and increase the number of TDM's each partner has each month. Increasing visits with clients was a goal for this year; however, the ongoing pandemic and staffing shortages got in the way. We would like to get more natural supports involved and engaged in each partners treatment plan. HEAT has exemplified response to emergency hospitalizations and will continue to build relationships and reduce barriers to collaborative discharge planning by working very closely with John George Psychiatric Pavilion, Villa Fairmont, Jay Mahler, Woodroe, Amber House, and HSP board and care to be involved in all steps of discharge planning and will continue to do so during this fiscal year. HEAT would like to move back towards a model where groups are planned and a calendar is produced monthly to encourage participant attendance and voice in groups. HEAT will work this year to implement at least 2 groups per month and one social event to encourage community building, interdependence and support.COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES173 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGMetrics % of FY 21/22 FSP clients that achieved the metric Reduction in Hospital Admits* 80% Reduction in Hospital Days* 84% Reduction in Psychiatric Emergency Services (PES)* 67% Reduction in Incarceration Days* 80% Increase in the number of days Stably Housed* 28% Primary Care visit within the previous year 74% With an educational goal who are enrolled in school 0 With a vocational goal who are employed 17% Received a follow up visit within five days after a mental health hospitalization or crisis 66% Average of four or more visits per month per client 50% *The metrics above measuring \"reductions\" are looking at FSP clients served in FY 21/22 who experienced one of these negative events (crisis, hospital admission, and incarceration) prior to enrollment in an FSP compared to the first year of FS P enrollment.

FY 21/22 challenges: As the pandemic continued this year, LIFT staff continued to go above and beyond to meet participants in the community, in office spaces, and via digital platforms to ensure their needs were being met. One of the biggest challenges continued to be accessing and outreaching in psychiatric care settings and jail. Historically locked settings are an opportunity for intensive engagement and trust building to prepare for reentry and support in the community. However, this year continued to have many barriers to outreach and engagement efforts; though LIFT was able to use unique and collaborative strategies to continue to meet our partners where they were at in their recovery and goals. LIFT also experienced substantial staff tu rnover and the lack of a nurse for most of the year (transferring internally, medical leave, and leaving the agency) which put a strain on the program as a whole. Though the team banded together and participant & programmatic needs continued to be met. Another challenge continues to be finding appropriate shelter housing placements due to increased demand of resources in the community; particularly licensed board and care homes that meet the needs of our partners and those which the partners are able to af ford due to their fixed monthly income. Finally, the additional stressors of the pandemic have resulted in increased relapse of substances, and the availability of substance treatment has been challenging. Many of our participants do not have the ability to call Centerpoint every day for a week or more in the hopes of finding a facility, and often relapse before a connection can be made. Is anyone better off? V. FY 21/22 Client Impact: LIFT participants have overcome a lot in the past year. Entering the second year of the pandemic, participants identified LIFT as one of the few resources they could continue to rely on during the chaos. The pandemic created increased barriers in the system for participants to access resources that they could previously man age independently, such as social services, DMV and social security. LIFT was able to minimize barriers and enroll/transfer Medi -Cal, SSI, and access to DMV services appointments for participants, where they otherwise were unable to follow through. LIFT w as able to support participants with employment with IPS throughout pandemic and had success stories linking participants to job training and to visit school graduations in order to inspire them and provide hope. Primary care and medication management wer e also great accomplishments of the LIFT program this year\u2014 as many clinics remain closed to in -person services, LIFT was able to offer advocacy, support, and our medication services to ensure participant needs were addressed. We have worked hard in the last year to promote budgeting skills and encourage our partners to contribute 30% of their income towards rent in order to promote independence and accountability. Two of our participants initially reported they would rather be homeless than pay towards t heir rent, however, they hesitantly agreed and now it is a source of pride that they pay their rent! One incredible success story is about a participant who we began serving in 2019 who struggled with managing psychosis symptoms, substance use, and was in and out of John George frequently. The COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES176 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGparticipant served 8 years in prison, and was referred to LIFT while he was in Santa Rita Jail where he spent over a year. The participant lost his father to suicide when he was 6 and he attempted suicide the same w ay, by hanging, the year he was referred to LIFT. He had difficulty managing severe psychosis symptoms, agitation, assaultive behaviors which resulted in recidivism in these crisis and criminal justice settings for most of his life. The participants moth er had a stay away order, he was estranged from his siblings, he was homeless and needed daily doses of methadone. The participant took his medications, but continued to use crisis services and crave substances. After a lot of rapport building, consisten cy in meeting with LIFT, the participant began to improve his relationship with his mother. In the spring of 2021 he began to decrease methadone, was living with his mother and attending substance treatment groups. This participant began to feel more con fident and his self -esteem grew as he rebuilt and built relationships and he began to feel more hopeful about the future. He has a face tattoo that is a reminder of his old life and he requested help with removal as it affects his feelings of self -worth an d self-esteem. LIFT has supported him with three treatments and the participants confidence is building as his tattoo recedes, it will be gone after two more treatments. The participant began to meet with LIFT IPS and recently completed forklift training a nd is actively interviewing and seeking employment. The participant has a permanent supportive housing match and will have his own home in a couple of months. He is saving up for a car and feeling very hopeful about his future. This participant has had zero interactions with emergency, forensics or any kind of crisis services in one year. He has been able to successfully manage his psychosis symptoms, cravings for substances and learn and use coping and communication skills. We look forward to his gradua tion from LIFT to a lower level of service! LIFT was able to graduate three partners to a lower level of care, either psychiatric outpatient treatment or a Level 1 community -based program. LIFT has had two partners that moved into Permanent Supportive Ho using. We continue to make a positive impact in the lives of the partners we serve. LIFT has worked tirelessly to decrease reliance on emergency psychiatric services to promote independence, community, and self -esteem. Another LIFT partner had not been able to maintain housing (clogging toilets or becoming aggressive with neighbors due to fears people were entering his room by various means) due to paranoia. With consistent engagement and rapport building, the participant agreed to see LIFT psychiatrist and began to take medication and has been learning to tolerate distress. Participant has maintained housing for more than six months, meets with various staff and participates in community outings. poor medication compliance and aggression, incarceratio n, homelessness, and violence, was able to maintain stable housing for 5 months. This is the longest he has maintained housing outside of an institution. Overall LIFT reduced the number of partners that were re -hospitalized, by providing wraparound servic es 7 days a week with a passionate and dedicated team. LIFT exemplifies what it means to provide collaborative wraparound care, coordinating with family, friends, landlords, hospitals, and clinics from the start of services with participants and timely in the event of crisis or support needs.

We provide clients with education about their mental health and substance use symptoms that can increase understanding and a sense of control over thei r lives. We educate about ways that stigma from society may imp act their own sel f perceptions. We are with clients side-by-side in the community which allows us to advocat e for fair treatment, as well as model for community members, how to interact with people who are experiencing symptoms of mental health diagnoses in real time .

FY 21/22 challenges: FY21/22 was a time of great uncertainty due to the stressors of the global pandemic, housing insecurity, increased risk of substance use, increase of hate crimes directed towards vulnerable populations, increased cost of livng, es pecially for housing and food. While all these factors impacted our clients, the most challenging of the past year were the shortage of safe, affordable housing, increased cost of living due to inflation, and the dangerous risk of overdose and death due to the easy accessibli ty of fentanyl and other street drugs. Is anyone better off? V.FY 21/22 Client Impact: \"Dante\" is a 27 year-old man, referred to JAMHR in 2019, when he aged out of the TAY FSP Program. In the previous 2 years, he has been in and out of jail and psych emergency services, making it difficult for the team to meet with him and build rapport. When he was available to meet with staff he presented as angry, aggressive, demanding, with poor impulse control and often inebriated. Staff were often afraid of his responses, and provided minimal services due to safety concerns. In the past year, he has finally begun to build rapport with the JAMHR team. This rapport has allowed for more in-depth and honest conversations about Dante's hopes and dreams for the future, his challenges with substance use and his history of trauma. Dante is now able to interact with JAMHR staff in an open and honest way, he is able to participate in harm reduction regarding his substance use, he asked for and has been able to maintain housing. He demonstrates insight into his need for a higher quality and more structured home environment going forward and is participating in planning for a move to a more supportive environment soon. He is able to identify the benefits of meaningful activity and has a plan with the JAMHR team to help him move towards positive and creative use of his time. He still has moments of frustration but demonstrates an ability to manage the frustration and avoid falling back into destructive or threatening behaviors. Dante is now someone that the JAMHR team looks forward to working with! VI.

Projections of Clients to be Served: JAMHR currently has 100 unique partners open to service and 4 referrals in outreach status. We project that we will remain at or above full census of 100 partners throughout the FY22-23 year. Projection that we will be able to inactivate up to 10% of our partner census due to graduation and moving out of county during the 22-23 year, making room for 10 new partners to join and benefit from our services. For FY 22/23 -25/26 we estimate to serve 100 partners per year. VIII.

Circa60 makes an effort to meet clients where they are at and normalizes and validates their experiences ; additionally, Circa60 works to provide clients with opportunities to connect with other clients at social and other events to decrease the stigma and isolation common with people struggling with their mental health. b.Create a Welcoming Environment: Circa60 works to support clients and those involved in their care wherever they are, whether that be at home, at a hospital or other medical or mental health facility, in jail, at the office, at an outdoor location, by phone, or anywhere else. Circa60 additionally seeks to be collaborative and flexible in all interactions and to embody the principle of cultural humility for both clients and each other. Finally, Circa60 encourages clients to come to the Towne House wellness center where Circa60 has its office to feel more at home with the agency, and has also been diligent in fo llowing health guidelines regarding COVID- 19 to ensure the safety of our clients. III. Language Capacity for this Program: English and Spanish , access to the county Language Line. IV. FY 21/22 challenges : The COVID -19 pandemic continued to greatly impact the older adults which make up Circa60 clients, and often led to barriers for Circa60 to serve clients, as many in our program reside in facilities such as hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, and board and cares which have at timesCOMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES184 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGlimited or refused visitation due to outbreaks and/or high risk levels. Nonetheless, Circa60 worked hard to continue to serve our clients through flexibility, creativity, and collaboration, whether that meant speaking to clie nts through a fence at the property line, frequent phone check -ins, collaborating with facility staff to do video calls, or through other means. COVID -19 also contributed to some staff turnover at Circa60, though Circa60 was able to hire some incredibly s trong new staff as well. Furthermore, the impacts of the COVID -19 pandemic also contributed to the isolation of our clients which of course negatively impacts their mental health, but Circa60 did as much as possible to continue to link clients to COVID -safe community events, resources, and their families. Additionally, a lot of residential programs are not available to Circa60 clients due to their medical needs and so our clients are (often unintentionally) being discriminated against via not having equit able access because of their disabilities ; in the last year we have had clients turned down from unlicensed room and boards, crisis stabilization units, crisis residential treatment, and residential substance treatment programs due to our clients' conditio ns such as being blind, not being fully ambulatory, using an oxygen tank, or otherwise having \"too complex \" medical needs. This has at times resulted in our clients ending up hospitalized, not receiving needed care, or ending up on the streets whereas wit hout their medical needs they would have had additional options. Nonetheless Circa60 continued to support our clients however possible as well as to advocate for additional services and decreased barriers. Is anyone better off? V.FY 21/22 Client Impact: Circa60 has been working to ensure all willing clients have regular primary care visits and to reconnect isolated clients to family/friends. Circa60 supported a man in his early 70s with re- connecting with family who he hadn't had much contact with in years, supporting him to visit one of his children on multiple occasions which in turn allowed him to furthermore see his former spouse. Additional, Circa60 helped him this year in getting back on track with his medical care, with his primary case manager paying close attention to his changing medical needs and being a strong advocate to ensure he gets the care he needed, including after a terrible incident where he was hospitalized for days after a stranger drugged him; the Circa60 team, led by his primary case manager, supported him throughout his stay in the hospital, advocated for his needs with hospital staff and his housing staff, keeping his child informed, and ensuring follow-ups after hospital discharge. Circa60 is looking forward to continuing to support this client to stay connected to his family and receive all needed medical care, as well as to help other isolated clients in re-connecting with lost family members and all our clients with their medical needs. VI. FY 21/22 Additional Information: Circa60 worked hard to support clients with taking precautions against COVID-19 given their increased risk due to their age and medical concerns. VII. Projections of Clients to Changes: Almost all willing clients have been connected to primary care at this point, and Circa60 will continue to attempt to connect any remaining clients (as well as new clients) to primary care. Circa60 will also build on its initiative to re-connect isolated clients to lost family members and is excited for the reunions that are envisioned. Additionally, as the COVID-19 pandemic allows Circa60 will build towards increased community events and starting groups to support clients in connecting to each other and the larger community.COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES185 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGMetrics % of FY 21/22 FSP clients that achieved the metric Reduction in Hospital Admits* 61% Reduction in Hospital Days* 70% Reduction in Psychiatric Emergency Services (PES)* 73% Reduction in Incarceration Days* 86% Increase in the number of days Stably Housed* 51% Primary Care visit within the previous year 39% With an educational goal who are enrolled in school 0 With a vocational goal who are employed 9% Received a follow up visit within five days after a mental health hospitalization or crisis 69% Average of four or more visits per month per client 49% *The metrics above measuring \"reductions\" are looking at FSP clients served in FY 21/22 who experienced one of these negative events (crisis, hospital admission, and incarceration) prior to enrollment in an FSP compared to the first year of FSP enrollment.

Please Describe Ways that the Program Strives to: a.Reduce Mental Health Stigma: The mission of the City of Fremont's Human Services Department is to deliver excellent and culturally sensitive services to all consumers in a caring, nurturing, and respectful environment while improving their quality of life free of stigma and discrimination. ACBH mission is to maximize the recovery, resiliency and wellness of all eligible clients who are developing or experien cing mental health challenges so they can successfully realize their potentials and pursue their dreams free of stigma and discrimination. To support City of Fremont and ACBH mission, we implement the following: Senior Mobile Mental Health Program and all other City programs continues to see the need to conduct anti -stigma program presentation to community partners to increase their awareness about mental illness and to join forces/capacity to decrease stigma and discrimination against people with mental health challenges. The program takes the lead in educating other City of Fremont's staff abut mental illness to increase thei r awareness of their attitudes and behaviors towards clients suffering from mental illness. Educating our client and their families about mental health needs/issues and to help them maximize their le arnings about their experiences, will motivate and prepar e them to make good decision about different aspects of their lives .

IV.FY 22/23 challenges: Pandemic has put major hardhips on both clients and service providers re: service delivery. Re -structured program delivery was implemented to meet client's needs. We implemented a hybrid syste m of in- person, telehealth and phone interface with clients consistent with their wishes and compliance with the Al ameda County Safety Response Protocol. Undoubtedly, the public health crisis (pandemic) has contributed to client's worseing of their sympt oms and increased in isolative behaviors. All program clients have co- occuring medical and physical conditions leading to treatment cancellation thus trigger increase in their mental health symptoms. In addition, due to medical issues, they take so many medication and some clients prefer not to consider adding psychiatric medication to their on - going medication regimen. Individual therapy becomes ineffective if client's mental health symptoms are not lifted at some level. Losing some level of independence ie: decline in mobility, increase falls, decline in vision, losing family and friends. Is anyone better off?

Please Describe Ways that the Program Strives to: a)Reduce Mental Health Stigma: The mobile crisis teams provide ongoing outreach, engagement, and psychoeducation to individuals living with mental health challenges, their loved ones, law enforcement, and the genera l community. Crisis Services Outreach and Engagement teams are also 80% staffed by peers with lived experience. Many Crisis Services staff have been involved with the P ool of Consumer Champions (POCC) in the p ast or are currently involved . Crisis Services has worked closely with ACBH' s Office of Peer Support Services to incorporate consumer voices in the planning, delivery, and continuous quality improvement of our expansion and current services. Crisis Services also incorporates views, feedback, and assist ance from the Office of Ethnic Services in the recruitment, staff retention, and diverse needs around training and community resources in order to provide services to all residents of Alameda County. In other efforts to reduce stigma, Crisis Services utili zes a fleet of vehicles that have \"Crisis Services\" written on the side. This communicates the presence of Crisis Services in the communities we serve. All of our teams can transport consumers to a variety of settings whenever appropriate and safe to do so . We only involve law enforcement when necessary. b)Create a Welcoming E nvironment : Since 2019, Crisis Services has been providing field and phone -based crisis intervention, outreach and engagement services to individuals acro ss the lifespan throughout Alameda County .

Crisis Services staff provided nearly 50 pre sentations to a wide range of stakeholders who benefit from our services. We have also strongly encouraged callers to contact Crisis Services directly when needed. In regards to our w ork environment, Crisis Services has developed a comprehensive training and on-boarding program including a manual and at least two weeks of shadowing and training with more experienced staff. Although not funded via MHSA, we also implemented a yearly staf f retreat and appreciation station with self -care items to assist with morale during these difficult times. We hope that these activities will assist with staff recruitment and retention . III. Language Capacity for this Program: Currently, Crisis Service s language capacity is English, Spanish, Vietnamese, Cantonese, and Mandarin. We also have staff who speak conversational Japanese and American Sign Language. The language line is utilized for all other languages when translation is needed or requested. Vi deo translation wil l be added in the future . The ACBH Office of Ethnic Services has assisted wi th the translation of Crisis Services brochures and resource materials for all threshold languages in Alameda County. Crisis Services staff also provide consent forms and informing materials in threshold languages . IV. FY 21/22 challenges: Similar to the previous fiscal year, Crisis Services' on -going expansion and services have been impacted by COVID -19 and other events that have affected staff and residents of Alameda County including, but not limited to, political unrest, racial/ethnic disparities in communiti es of color accessing and or utilizing mental health and substance use treatment, and now a recession. The global pandemic in addition to environmental factors, have resulted in an increase in mobile crisis team calls for services especially for children, tr ansitional age youth, and older adults. Requests for wellness checks have also increased. We have also experienced significant challenges in staff r ecruitment. Many professionals are leaving the Bay Area due to the high cost of living. Furthermore, many public and private entities are competing for the same mental health providers. Is anyone better off? V. FY 21/22 Client Impact: Focused marketing of Crisis Services via presentations and participation in many community events have resulted in an average of 600 d irect calls to Crisis Services per month.These calls include referrals to our mobile and outreach teams, information, care cordination and follow up. Coordination between Crisis Services and voluntary crisis stabilization, crisis residential t reatment , sobering and detox facilities has resulted in a reduction of involuntry psychitric holds. All of our teams can transport individuals directly to these services. Staff are in field more than 75% of their shift. This ensures that services are provided in settings that are most convient to the community . ACBH Crisis Services, in collaboration Crisis Support Servicesof Alameda County (CSS ), has implemented AB988. This partnership includes a monthly stakeholder meeting, coordination of warm handoff s from CSS to Crisis Services on-duty clinicians , and same day response form our mobile crisis teams when needed . So far approximately 2% of call ers to CSS require community response which highlights the expertise of the CSS staff in providing de -escalation and support.

S taff provide information and referral for voluntary mental health, SUD, and other community services. We have found that the face to f ace contact has helped to develop rapport with the community a nd increase the likelyhood of consumer s agreeing to care. Mobile crisis staff have spent more time at local board and c are homes to support consumers at risk of losing placement due to decompensation and other issues related to mental hea lth symptoms. Our goal is to help consumers maintain housing and reduce calls to law enforcment by these homes. Mobile team staff discuss safety pl ans, and de -escalation / diversion strategies with staff and provide care cordination with assigned mental he alth providers. Outreach teams will visit consumers newly or temporarily placed in these homes. Outreach and engagement teams c ollab with H ealthcare for the Homeless, other street health teams , and the public libraries to provide resources and linkage t o mental health and SUD services.

FY 22/23 Programs or Service Changes: ACBH Crisis Services will transition to a System of Care, which will result in further expansion of Crisis Services, increase collaborations with community partners, and require the creation of additional administrative and clinical positions. We also plan to implement an internship program to help increase our overall capacity. We hope interns will considering joining our teams permanently. We will continue our efforts to recruitment and retain, staff and hope to revamp our clinical staff classification to allow for the hiring of license eligible clinicians. We will also partner with the Office of Peer Support Services to develop a crisis specific peer/family training program. Finally, we hope to pilot bilateral referrals between 911 and 988. 988/CSS already refer s callers experiencing an emergency to 911.

The goals of BHC are to reduce recidivism and improve the quality of life, and assist severely mentally ill offender s by diverting them away from the criminal justice system and into community treatment with judicial oversight. Target Population: Justice involved adults age 18 and older with serious mental illness and cooccurring substance use disorder. Individuals must have pending criminal charges that were the result of their symptoms of mental illness. Consumers include Transitional Age Youth, Adults and Older Adults. How Much Did We Do? I. FY 21/22: a.Number of Unique Clients Served: ACBH received 149 referrals for Behavioral Health Court during FY 21/22. Approximately 145 clients were served during FY 21/22. As the program typically lasts 12-24 months, the total number of clients served may include individuals referred prior to FY21/22 . Approximately 25 individuals successfully graduate d during the FY21/22 period - this number reflects individuals who were referred and admitted during prior fiscal years, including clients admitted during FY18/19. Cost per client: $2,080 How Well Did We Do? II. Please Descr ibe Ways that the Program Strives to: a.Reduce mental health stigma: BHC reduces stigma by reminding clients and the community that hope and recovery are possible. By having regular engagement with treatment and ongoing court oversight, clients are able to maintain stability in the community and make progress toward recover y in discovering meaningful activities and holding meaningful roles, often returning to school or work and becoming leaders and role models for their peers newly enrolled in Behavioral Health Court. b.Create a welcoming environment: BHC is a collaborative effort between the Alameda County Superior Court, District Attorney, Public Defender, Alameda County Behavioral Health, and community mental health treatment providers. The BHC Team consists of dedicated staff from each department who have special knowledg e and sensitivity to mental health issues, in addition to representatives from forensic focused treatment teams. BHC is non -adversarial. BHC Team members realize the importance of recognizing and rewarding individuals who do well. Participants are praised and rewarded in court for their progress. III. Language Capacity for this Program: The BHC program is able to utilize ACBH Language Phone Line and in person Language Interpretation Services that are available to the court. The courts' in person Language Services are able to accommodate almost any language needed, including sign language, andCOMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES194 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGhave specialized training for legal terms. The Language Phone Line contracted through ACBH is medically certified and confidential. IV. FY 21/22 challenges: BHC is one of many court programs available to clients who are justice involved including: Drug Court, Informal Court, Veterans Court, Homeless and Caring Court. The differentiation between the many programs , their requirements and limitations is often confusing even for those who are direclty involved in the programs. ACBH and representatives of Drug court offered a presentation at the beginning of FY21/22 in hopes of clarifying some of the key differences between our programs, and improve the appropriateness of referrals being made. As with many other programs, there has been a regular shift of staff with Behavioral Health Court. ACBH hired a new Mental Health Specialist to fill a vacant position. There was also a rotation of council and bench with new Deputy Public Defender, new Deputy District Attorney, and new judge for Behavioral Health Court. Because of the way BHC was originally set up, BHC did not previously track data for referrals being made, and only tracked data for individuals after they were admitted. Starting in 2019, BHC began documenting and collecting data for all referrals received. Because of the multiple systems/stakeholders that hold various aspects of the information, there is no centralized agency identified, nor full time funded pe rson to collect, mangae, and analyze this data. It is our hope that ongoing negotiations with the MOU will allow us to identify resources to improve this in the years to come. Is anyone better off? V. FY 21/22 Client Impact: As a result of Behavioral Heal th Court, clients were able to have improved access to treatment, increased engagement with wellness and recovery activities, and reduced number of days in institutional settings. The BHC program also improves public safety, health, and property of the sur rounding community. VI. FY 21/22 Additional Information: Alameda County Behavioral Health Court is unique from many other Behavioral Health Courts throughout California in that Alameda County BHC 1) is predominantly pre -plea, 2) Probation is not involved in program administration or funding, and 3) client's charges are waived or reduced or records sealed upon successful completion of the program. Behavioral Health Court additionally accepts clients with STRIKE charges, in which case they are admitted to BHC post plea with a deferred entry of judgement. BHC continues to accept a range of charges from misdemeanor to felony including (but not limited to): trespassing, theft, grand theft, assault, and a ssault with a deadly weapon . The District Attorney and judge are careful to take into consideration the desire of the identified victim (s), when considering violent charges. Family members often play a key role in advocacy for their loved ones . Whether the charges are permitt ed is typically negotiated between the defense council and district attorney of the originating court of referral. Each member of the BHC Team (Judge, District Attorney, Defense Council, and ACBH) must approve of the admission in order for the individual t o participate. It is important to note that BHC is partially funded by the Alameda County Behavioral Health through funds made available by the Mental Health Services Act of 2004. ACBH provides the funding for the COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES195 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGClinicians, Peer Specialist, and Clinica l Supervisor.

Clients may be connected to either intensive community services or full service partnerships. Individuals needing less intensive services are referred to Informal Court or other court programs. To maintain the high quality of engagement with current staffing available for assessments and collection of court reports, BHC clinicians maintain a 1 to 30 staff to client ratio, and can accommodate a total census of 100 clients at any point in time. For FY 2022/2023, depending on the volume of arrests and charges brought against clients with severe mental illness, BHC will continue to serve as many individuals as possible. VIII. FY 22/23 Programs or Service Changes: The agreement between ACBH, The Superior Court, Alameda County Public Defender's Office and District Attorney's Office is currently under review for revision to reflect the current laws and work flow practices, and ensure health equity for all clients referred. Additionally, the Forensic Diversion and Reentry Services System of Care anticipates continued changes throughout the system related to alignment with our \"True North Metrics\", the implementation of CalAIM, and in response to other mandates.COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES196 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGOUTREACH / ENGAGEMENT & SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT (OESD) REPORT OESD #: OESD 7 PROVIDER NAME: Alameda County Collaborative Courts PROGRAM NAME: Mental Health Court Specialist Program Description: The MHSA -funded mental health navigator position works in the Office of Collaborative Court Services (OCCS) which manages eight treatment courts in Alameda County.

Please Describe Ways that the Program Strives to: a.Reduce Mental Health Stigma: The Mental Health Service Act (MHSA) -funded mental health navigator ensures that treatment court participants are quickly linked to mental health services in Alameda County. He approaches clients using Telecare's recovery -centered clinical system (RCCS) which emphasizes client empowerment to make changes that promote recovery. Immediate client -centered contact a nd supported linkage - The mental health navigator connects with clients to discuss their mental health treatment options and to ask and answer questions. He approaches treatment clients as partners and acts as an advocate for their care. He makes referrals through ACCESS and maintains contact with clients to support warm handoffs to their new providers. He ensures that clients engage with services and provides ongoing service connections as needed. He also provides interim services such as linkage to crisis residential programs and community programs.COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES197 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGUtilizes effective screening - The mental health navigator utilizes information from the evidence -based mental health screen form (MHSF III) administered by a licensed clinician. The MHSF III identifies the court clients' most pressing mental health needs. Client- centered referral process - Through the recovery -centered clinical system (RCCS) lens, the mental health navigator engages clients in conversations about their recovery journey and supports them with plans for treatment linkage that advance their goals. Prior to calling or submitting a written referral for services, the client is consulted about what information she or he would like to be shared (or not to be shared) and what they hope to gain from the referral. Bridging treatment teams - The mental health navigator introduces drug tr eatment and mental health providers to one another and assists with coordinating treatment team meetings to support a more holistic health experience for the treatment court clients. Language - The mental health navigator uses person -centered empowering la nguage to describe clients' substance use and mental health needs. The RCCS model which the mental health navigator utilizes focuses on culture and conversation and in interviews with clients he is sensitive to how language shapes relationships, supports a wellness culture, and how it can reduce stigma around health needs. The influence of the mental health navigator and Telecare team has changed the way our justice partners speak about (and with) this population. Conversations are more health -focused with less judgmental and stigmatizing language. b.Create a Welcoming Environment: Trauma informed court setting -The mental health navigator supports a trauma informed court culture in which the environment is stable and predictable, and he is present, so clients feel supported. The hearing process is ritualized to reduce any anxiety or trauma related to the court environment. For example, clients are welcomed, the mental health navigator introduces himself, and explains his role at each hearing. Pre-court staffing meetings - Before each court session, the mental health navigator participates in a pre -court meeting in which each client and their needs are discussed. The navigator presents a goal plan that the Judge can use to help the client engage in services, including medication support if necessary. This includes making accommodations for those that may have emotional and/or behavioral challenges to ensure that they feel supported within the court setting. The navigator updates the Judge and partners on client progress since the last court session so the team can collaborate to develop a plan for court interventions as needed. For example, if a client has recently relapsed, this information can be discussed before the hearing, so the judge is prepared to r equest increased treatment engagement. The mental health navigator may for example, share that the client, though struggling, has recently reached out for more assistance and this can be praised by the judge as well. Modifications within court setting - \"Breakout\" rooms are built into virtual court hearings in which clients may meet with their attorneys, the mental health navigator, or other team members for private discussions if needed. The mental health navigator may offer follow -up services to any clien ts expressing mental health service needs within the court space or mayCOMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES198 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGcheck in with anyone who seems distressed. The mental health navigator is also available for check -ins with clients before court to offer support and reduce any court -related anxiety. III. Language Capacity for this Program: English and the services of an interpreter as needed. IV. FY 21/22 challenges: A mental health staffing shortage occurred during this fiscal year, at the same time that mental health issues increased in severity. Co-occurring treatment facilities -imposed quarantines that limited available beds. Some available providers were less experienced, which increased the tasks performed by the mental health navigator to include medication management, housing referrals, and referrals to other services such as benefit advocacy. The number of justice - involved individuals referred to the collaborative courts with high mental health level -of-care needs increased substantially. Is anyone better off? V.FY 21/22 Client Impact: Every client with mental health needs with whom the mental health navigator interacted was referred to services and admitted to a provider offering the appropriate level of care within two weeks or less. Testimonial: \"I was having a really tough time and within a day I got support which helped save my life. I got into an SLE from the help of my case manager and the mental health team helped me and got on a call with a psychiatrist and my primary care physician. My medication got set right up. Sometimes I get overwhelmed with setting up appointments and all the 'adulting stuff' and they made it successful and were really supportive.

Note that this includes just one half of fiscal year 2021 - 22. Also depicted here is a statistically significant difference between departments in the proportions of participants receiving these services, ranging from 81.3% in Family Treatment Court Department 405 to 16.7% in Family Treatmen t Court Department 404. The low proportion of parents served by the mental health navigator in this department is likely due to the fact that the Case Manager is a licensed therapist. The second lowest proportion (26.9%) in the Veterans Treatment Court is due to the fact that this court transitions people out of county mental health services and into federally funded mental health services provided by the Veterans Administration. The Office of Collaborative Court Services monitors its operations to identify and mitigate any disparity related to participants' race/ ethnicity, gender, age, and co -occurring disorders. The table at right reflects no statistically significant differences between racial/ ethnic groups in the proportions of persons served by the mental health navigator. \"All Other Races\" includes 13 Asians, seven Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islanders, five Native American/Alaska Natives, and four persons who identified as \"Some other race.\" Fifty -six of 105 (53.3%) participants identified as females at birth and 67 of 130 (51.5%) of persons identified as males at birth were served by the mental health navigator; nearly equivalent proportions.

Individuals must be eligible for diversion or re -entry services to the community. Consumers include Transitional Age Youth, Adults and Older Adults. How Much Did We Do? I. FY 21/22: a.Number of Unique Clients Served: 68. Cost per client: $2,080 How Well Did We Do? II. Please Describe Ways that the Program Strives to: a.Reduce Mental Health Stigma: CAP offers consultation and education to Judges, Public Defenders, District Attorneys, Probation Officers, community treatment providers, and family members. As a result , Criminal Justice Professionals were better able to recognize, understand, and address the underlying issues leading to recidivism; families and community treatment providers were better able to navigate the court system and advocate for their loved ones/ partners, and clients were linked to the right -matched level of behavioral health care support. b.Create a Welcoming Environment: CAP believes it is our responsibility as clinicians to create a safe and tolerant environment, whether seeing a client at the ja il, or in the court. CAP strives to be free from prejudice, stigma, and discrimination, to be respectful, understanding, and trauma - informed. CAP focuses on the ethical practices of social work and psychosocial rehabilitation . CAP holds hope for recovery , even if someone has lost it for themselves. CAP empowers individuals with choice and the right to self -determinatio n. Overall, CAP reduces recidivism to jail by successfully engaging people with welcoming and trauma informed practices, connecting people with serious mental health conditions to outpatient mental health services , and crafting mental health dispositions for re -entry back into the community. III. Language Capacity for this Program: The CAP program is able to utilize ACBH Language Phone Line and in person Language Interpretation Services that are available to the court.

FY 21/22 challenges: The Court Advocacy Project experienced a marked increase in referrals for enrollment throughout the fiscal year. While there are many factors that may contribute to this, it coincided with intermitent staff absences due to Covid -19 related needs - similar to staffing shortages experienced across California.COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES203 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGIs anyone better off?

FY 21/22 Additional Information: The Court Advocacy Project has had a steady increase in referrals in this past FY. There are may factors that may be affecting this: 1)Covid Restrictions lifting. Previously ongoing Covid precautions for safety affected the ability for forensic alienists contracted by the court to complete assessments, which led to a decrease in referrals. In this past year, sevearl of the judges met with the alienists and ACSO to resolve these issues and smooth their ability to initiate the referral process to CAP. 2)The end of the COVID-19 Emergency Bail Schedule. We previously saw a decrease in referrals under the Emergency Bail Scheduled. Many individuals were released from custody, or cited and releasd, without first being connected to services. We have seen an increase in referrals since the end of the emergency bail schedule, and also received referrals for those who were previously released and then re-arrested . 3)The implementation of SB317. In September 2021, Senate Bill 317 was passed to revise the existing Penal Code 1370.01 which affects individuals who are considered incompetent to stand trial for misdemeanor charges (Law section (ca.gov)). As a result, the court has new options for referrals to clients who are affected by this revised law including mental health diversion, Assisted Outpatient Treatment, and Conservatorship. While there are new legal options for the criminal court, ACBH continues to work with representatives of Alameda County's Superior Court, Public Defender, and District Attorney's office to clarify procedures and eligibility for services. 4)Conserved clients being arrested from hospital settings. At times we have seen referrals for clients who assault a staff person while inpatient at an acute hosptial and are arrested and taken to the jail despite the conservatorship. All mental health services at the jail are voluntary and once there, may choose to cease taking medications. VII. Projections of Clients to be Served: Depending on the volume of arrests and charges brought against clients with severe mental illness, CAP will continue serving as many individuals as possible. There is currently no limit on the number of clients CAP may serve , however CAP estimate to serve approximately 70 clients per fiscal year 22/23 - 25/26. Staff continue to work with clients deemed incompetent to stand trial and offer voluntary services and linkages to individuals eligible for our county mental health plan. VIII. FY 22/23 Programs or Service Changes: COVID, legal changes, increased pre-crisis services available throughout Alameda County, and shifting political and societal awareness all have the potential to impact our forensic behavioral health services and the Court Advocacy Project. Many criminal courts now use a hybrid model for meeting in person and holding online hearings and we expect this to continue for the forseeable future. We additionally anticipate the implementation of \"Care Courts\" throughout California, and the possible passage of AB 2275 (affecting 5150 holds, due process, and LPS conservatorships) may also have the potential to affect CAP services. As always CAP remains flexible to meet clients' needs and offer education and support to help navigate the ongoing changes to the many systems it touche s.

Coordinates referrals and linkages to mental health services in order to ensure seamless continuity of care when discharged from juvenile hall to community based providers. Target Population: Youth ages 12 -25 years old who are involved in the juvenile justice system and their families. How Much Did We Do? I. FY 21/22: a.Number of Unique Clients Served: 346. Cost per client: $478 How Well Did We Do? II. Please Describe Ways that the Program Strives to: a.Reduce Mental Health Stigma: The Guidance Clinic (GC) actively works to reduce mental health stigma for youth involved in the Juvenile Justice System. This fiscal year, the GC continued to implement its new process to have a GC clinician meet with every youth upon their detainment into Juvenile Hall. As indicated in last year's report, this outreach approach helps reduce stigma by further integrating mental health services as part of the standard programming for youth (i.e., it is part of the intake process for every youth), and by hel ping youth understand that mental health services can be beneficial during stressful and traumatic events . GC clinicians continue to maintain a regular presence on the detention units in the Juvenile Hall and Camp Wilmont Sweeney (the other detention faci lity on the Juvenile Justice Center campus). The clinicians are part of the milieu, actively checking -in with youth and engaging staff from the Probation Department who work on the unit. Clinicians are seen as part of the daily functioning of the units and youth know that they can always speak to a clinician whenever the clinician is not in a session. Maintaining a presence on the units reduces mental health stigma by allowing the clinician to build trusting relationships with youth and staff, while normali zing the services the clinicians provide. New for the FY 21/22 are the addition of groups and the Juvenile Institutional Officer (JIO) guides. This year, GC clinicians offered groups, one premised on the Seeking Safety model and another called \"The Don't Call It a Grief Group \" group. The groups ran regularly, interrupted only by public health circumstances or crisis . The groups reduced stigma by providing the benefit of increased social support and reducing isolation. Participants were able to co -develop and reinforce adaptive coping skills, something particularly salient to the disenfranchised grief that youth may be experiencing in the custodial environment. This year, GC also created Behavioral Health guides for all juvenile institution officers (JIOs) to support their understanding of behavioral health conditions, how such conditions can manifestCOMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES205 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGin a juvenile custody setting, and what they can do in response. The guide s, totaling more than 60 pages, will be placed into Care Coordination binders that si t at the unit desks on each unit. Appreciating the content of the JIO guides, probation leadership offered GC team members four -to-five hours to provide behavioral health -related training for participants in probation 's required Core training. The guides and correspondent training will reduce stigma by providing information that is easy -to-read, relatable, normalizing, and actionable. b.Create a Welcoming Environment: The GC continues to work with our Probation partners to make several changes in order to create a more welcoming environment for our youth. With the momentum from the prior year's redesign of the detention units, the GC and partners from JJC Medical s uccessfully advocated for all youth in the facility to receive sleep masks . The team also updated the sleep protocol . The protocol was premised on standards from the National Commission on Correctional Healthcare (NCCHC) and clarified roles for the JJC's pediatrician; nurse manager; psychiatrists; behavioral health clinicians; and juveni le institution officers. Importantly, the protocol removed the need for youth with sleep disturbances to await follow -up after the weekly Care Coordination meeting. Instead , all parties now have a flowchart that can be acted upon as soon as youth or staff report sleep difficulties. Sleep masks and the updated, streamlined sleep protocol are inextricably linked to creating a welcoming and nurturing environment, as sleep is essential for human existence and survival. The afore described JIO guides are also i ntegral to facilitating a welcoming environment. JIOs with awareness of behavioral health presentations and conditions may be able to regulate their verbal and non -verbal communication as well as spatial and physical orientation when interacting with youth affected by ADHD, mood disruption, post -traumatic stress injury, etc. Increased JIO awareness and regulation could lead youth to feel less stigmatized and isolated and to be more open to participating in behavioral health interventions, formal or informal , and offered by behavioral health professionals or other JJC partners. While incarceration will never be a truly welcoming experience, the GC has worked closely with Probation, medical, and education partners to improve the physical environment and ensur e youth feel supported by staff. III. Language Capacity for this Program: The GC has one Spanish speaking clinician. IV. FY 21/22 challenges: This year, challenges related to staffing and ongoing COVID -19 policy and practice adjustments. As with other behavioral health clinics, the Guidance Clinic lost staff to out -of- state moves and family/personal -related transitions. Also as with other clinics, GC staff members had to adjust to multiple unit composition shifts to accommodate public health needs. Is anyone better off? V. FY 21/22 Client Impact: Client impact is best shared through the stories of GC clinicians. Here are two: 1.A youth came into custody for the second time this year. During the follow -up meeting with a GC clinician, the youth was able to self-reflect and showed a different level of maturity and accountability than before. For example, he was able to identify family challenges that were detrimental to his growth and in turn communicate with his mother some of the things heCOMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES206 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGtalked about with his clinician. He was also able to share things he had not shared with her before. In the end, he was able to get some closure and gain a different level of understanding he didn't have before. 2.A youth had originally been detained for shooting at an occu pied vehicle and was initially resistant to mental health services. Eventually the youth participated in individual therapy, though he was opposed to family therapy. Over time, the youth changed his perspective and became open to family therapy, however th e youth's parent's attendance was inconsistent. Through therapy, the youth learned the significance of being able to identify his triggers for anger, verbally express when he was experiencing uncomfortable emotions and feelings, utilize effective coping in terventions, and understand that depression in young men can present in the form of anger. This youth graduated high school, completed Camp Sweeney, and is now gainfully employed in Alameda County. VI.FY 21/22 Additional Information: The number of youths served was lower than in past years due to lower arrest and detention rates. VII. Projections of Clients to be Served: Probation leadership projects that the census will rise this year, and therefore we anticipate serving around 500 youth in the next fiscal year s 22/23 - 25/26. This is due to factors including the closure of the Division of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) and recent legislation increasing the age to which young adults on juvenile probation can be held in juvenile detention facilities. VIII. FY 22/23 Programs or Service Changes: Guidance Clinic clinicians are providing services to youth on the \"secure track\" unit, or the unit providing services for youth who returned from the soon-t o-close Division of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) or who would otherwise have been referred there.COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES207 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGOUTREACH / ENGAGEMENT & SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT (OESD) REPORT OESD #: OESD 9 PROVIDER NAME: -Systemic Therapy (MST) Program Description: Multi -Systemic Therapy (MST) is a unique, goal -oriented, comprehensive treatment program designed to serve multi -problem youth in their community. MST interventions focus on key aspects of these areas in each youth's life. All interventions are designed in full collaboration with family members and key figures in each system - parents or legal guardians, school teachers and principals, etc. MST services are provided in the home, school, neighborhood and community by therapists fully trained in MST. Therapists work in teams and provide coverage for each other's caseloads when th ey are on vacation or on -call. MST therapists are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week through an on -call system (all MST therapists are required to be on -call on a rotating schedule). Treatment averages 3 -5 months.

Please Describe Ways that the Program Strives to: a.Reduce Mental Health Stigma: MST works to reduce stigma related to mental health by providing services on our clients' terms - in the community and during flexible times to meet the needs of our youth a nd families. We work very hard to focus on the families' goals for services and build relationships through the delivery of practical/tangible support (financial, transportation, etc. ). b.Create a Welcoming Environment: Many of the families we provide servic es to have experienced multiple traumas and have Family members who have mental health issues that have impaired their ability to successfully function in the community. MST provides in home and community -based service which reduces the stigma many familie s feel related to being in a facility that provides mental health services. By providing services in the home and community, MST strives to remove this stigma. MST is also present- focused and strength -based which empowers the families to utilize the posit ive aspects of their family system to develop effective strategies and interventions that support and assist them with managing any mental health issues they are encountering. The goal is to provide an experience with the client and the family that will di sconfirm their negative beliefs about mental health treatment and the stigma that's often attached to it. One of the primary tenants of MST is engagement. Family and caregiver engagement are critical to ensure positive treatment outcomes. The other purpose of engagement is to ensure that theCOMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES208 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGfamily feels heard and understood; we achieve engagement by spending a great deal of time listening to the \"story\" of the family. This creates an environ ment of acceptance and understanding which leads to higher level of engagement between the clinician, the client and their family. III. Language Capacity for this Program: We provide services in the families' preferred language. This year, we served 23 English -speaking families and 11 Spanish- speaking families. IV. FY 21/22 challenges: The ongoing COVID 19 pandemic continued to have an impact on the youth and families we serve. Youth struggled to get re -engaged with school and families struggled to fi nd stable work and housing coupled with the rising costs of living in the Bay Area. Our team continues to work creatively to find as many supports and resouirsces possible to support families during this challenging time. Is anyone better off? V. FY 21/2 2 Client Impact: Here is a case story submitted by one of our MST Clinicians that highlight some of the interventions provided by MST and the successes the youth and family were able to achieve during the course of treatment. (Client' s name ha s been changed to protect identity.) Jayde was 17 years old and was referred to the Seneca MST program by her Probation Officer for behaviors of aggression and school truancy. Jayde had been on Juvenile Probation since she was 13 years old, having over a d ozen violations and arrests that were impacting her safety and functioning in her home, community, and school settings. She had been referred to the MST program prior to the pandemic in 2019, although services could not remain open and continue after 30 da ys given the lack of engagement of her parent at the time. Flash forward to late 2021, Jayde was now re -referred and residing with her Aunt, and she had become a mother to a sweet and healthy baby that was under 1 year old. During the course of MST, Jayde and her Aunt actively engaged in the program, meeting with the Clinician twice per week to target her mental health and Probation conditions. She had expressed sincere motivation to address her Probation status and desire to be dismissed. Jayde was able to also begin engagement in a youth program where she became a paid Intern Youth Coordinator, as well as engage in weekly parenting courses to help her navigate motherhood and connect with other young mothers, and at the same time she maximized her education al goals by taking courses through independent studies. Jayde worked diligently in these areas for several months, while her Aunt remained a steadfast advocate and support in influencing her positively in all areas. The persistent efforts of the family wer e extremely fruitful, Jayde was able to meet her graduation requirements a month ahead of schedule, and she completed her internship at the youth program. Jayde continued to sustain her progress after walking the stage at graduation, and was dismissed from the Probation Department as she had gone above and beyond to meet her expectations, and had no instances of engagement in her referral behaviors for 5 consistent months. Jayde successfully completed all of her overarching MST goals and desired outcomes, a nd at case closure she was happily transitioning into independent and sustainable housing with her son and preparing to apply for community college.

Besides i n-person outreach and treatment sessions , online psychoeducation and telehealth treatment services were provided to accommodate some community members' safety concerns. Due to AAPI limited technology access and help- seeking pattern, extra efforts were recruited to expand the scope of outreach and enhance treatment participa tion. Owing to untimely service seeking, a good number of AAPI clients suffered from S/I, H/I and severe psychiatric symptoms upon the r eceipt of referrals, difficulties were encountered making urgent arrangement of psychiatric services with the limited resources in a short time frame.

Please Describe Ways that the Program Strives to: a.Reduce Mental Health Stigma: Our ACCESS staff and La Familia MPTI trainees provide psychotherapy to clients. The team strives to support clients while also reducing mental health stigma. La Familia's organizational values aligned with MHSA's principles. We strive to operate our program with these values in mind. Belonging - we help those around us feel important, connected, and confident in a community of hope. This sense of belonging is rooted in compassion and respect for shared cultures, values, and lived experiences Partnership - we engage in meaningful partnerships with organizations, communities, and the people we serve. Self-determination - we help people to recognize and build on their talents, strengths and goals to enhance their self -determination, leadership and power. Social Justice - we amplify the voices of our community to fight for systems, policies, opportunities and services that promote social and economic justice and improve the quality of life for all. Integrity - we hold ourselves to the highest standards of re spect, truthfulness, follow through and accountability. As a result, we achieve measurable results for the people and communities we serve. The Access Team of staff and practicum trainees, strives to reduce mental health stigma for the clients. One way the program achieves this, is to help make services accessible for the clients,COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES217 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGproviding the client knowledge about their symptoms, and about resources they can use (internal) coping skills or external (community resources) to improve their mental health symptoms. La Familia's Spanish Language ACCESS does serve a large number of Spanish speaking clients (monolingual) or (bilingual). Having the services accessible in the clients ' preferred language helps promote their mental health wellbeing . b.Create a Welc oming Environment: La Familia's value of belonging speaks to creating the welcoming environment to our clients. This value along with the other ones noted above, are integrated into the organization to remind staff of the values, such as at All Agency Staf f meetings. The ACCESS Program staff and trainees provide unconditional positive regard, empathy, compassion and respect to the program clients to help the clients feel welcomed. The staff and trainees receive supervision and guidance in ways to best support the clients using a variety of approaches. The La Familia MPTI practicum trainee program provides a vast array of training and supervision to its interns in topics pertaining to the client populations the intern is service. Our interns/trainees ar e focused on serving the Adult population and receive an adequate amount of training to support their learning and growth as a therapist. Additionally, staff and trainees learn about the importance of cultural sensitivity in working with Latino culture. Staff and trainees provide services to clients and their families in the Spanish language helping them receive support in their native language or their preferred language. All of the programs staff are bilingual Spanish and English and many are also bi -cultural. La Familia respects and values their staff and clients' for their variety of cultural diversity and provide culturally sensitive services. III. Language Capacity for this Program: Spanish and English. All our staff (Program Manager) and interns a re bilingual Spanish and English speaking. Our prior staff this past fiscal year were Spanish and English speaking and intern trainees this past fiscal year were also bilingual Spanish and English speaking. IV. FY 21/22 challenges: One of the main challen ges the program faced this year is staff. This is an ongoing delemma since the Covid pandemic began. It has become challenging to find Spanish Speaking applicants for the Staff therapist position s. The programs practicum trainee La Familia MPTI interns ha ve helped to mitigate the absence of staff therapists, in their ability to provide services. Another challenge is that there are a large number of Spanish clients that need mental health services or are requesting psychotherapy, and there are not very many providers to help support them. Although the program numbers for psychiatric medication managment visits is inceasing , there are still challenges to increase numbers as some clients may arrive already receiving psychotropic medications through their prima ry care provider, other chose not to select medication services. Is anyone better off? V.FY 21/22 Client Impact: Many of the clients we serve do report improvement in their symptoms, gaining a better awareness abouts their symptoms and having learned ways to better manage their symptoms. We were able to serve 90 plus clients and support them in bettering their lives through the mental health therapy support and community referrals. VI. FY 21/22 Additional Information: N/A VII.

As a result, the need for mental health services in our community has skyrocketed. The funds from Alameda County were used to increase our capability to serve. Aside from our traditional Family support groups and NAMI Family to Family classes, we also started many more services, such as online Zumba, Yoga, Tai Chi, Singing and Dancing classes to help combat the lonelines s and stress of our communities. Our Family Caregiver Support Group is for the people who have family members suffering from mental health issues. The purpose of this program is to provide support to those caregivers. It is offered once each month in both Cantonese and in Mandarin. Our Cantonese and Mandarin Mental Health Warmline, along with volunteer manned WeChat Support Groups also provided quick support to the people who have urgent needs. Target Population: We specialize in support of the first and second generation of ethnic Chinese who are suffering from mental health issues or whose family members are suffering from mental health issues. We provide language and culturally appropriate services to the popula tions we serve as the key strengths of MHACC. How Much Did We Do? I. FY 21/22: a.Number of Unique Clients Served: In the fiscal year of 21/22, MHACC has served more than 2,000 families. We let our community know that we are here for them. More importantly, we demonstrated that we have the knowledge and the will to help them. They see hope as long as we are around them. Program budget: $10,580 How Well Did We Do? II. Please Describe Ways that the Program Strives to: a.Reduce Mental Health Stigma: Mental Health Stigma is the major obs tacle for us to fully address mental health issues in our community. We have been battling stigma since day one of MHACC by translating mental health materials from reputable sources into Chinese and holding seminars, webinars and workshops in our communities . We also hold monthly Peer to Peer support groups and Family Caregiver support groups to fight against these stigmas through education and awareness. Dedicated Mental Health WeChat groups made a great difference in reaching out to a larger po pulation. b.Create a Welcoming Environment: Creating a welcome environment is critically important. We have singing and dancing classes to make people feel comfortable and welcomed. This gives people a safe and funs space while interacting with others. We or ganized multiple activities,COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES232 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGsuch as a Spring Festival event and Walking for a Healthy Body event. Of course, the major purpose of our variety of support groups is to let people feel welcomed, feel like and family, and have something to look forward to. III. Language Capacity for this Program: The Chinese language, Mandarin and Cantonese dialects are our specialties. We are also providing services in English. We can meet clients needs by providing them with the language or dialects they feel most comforta ble with. IV. FY 21/22 challenges: The greatest challenges we faced are the lack of awareness and knowledge about mental health in our community. We spent a great amount of time and effort to educate and re - educate the people. We try to convince them that mental health issues are like any other physical health issues which require medical care and should not be ignored. The other challenges resulted from the deep -rooted shame withint the Asian culture and immigrant backgrounds. Most of the clients we serve are the first -generation immigrants and their American born children. Due to the vastly different cultural and educaitonal backgroudns, the two generations often do not understand each other well, especially when mental health issues arive withint the family. We need to pay special attention to this. The pandemic also created a big challenge for us. The tradi tional physical gatherings and face to face meetings became impossible. We had to build up our virtual meeting capacity. Is anyone better off? V. FY 21/22 Client Impact: What MHACC has done and continues to do has saved many lives and many families. People thanked us when they or their family members overcame their mental health situations. Person A said: \"We just sent my husband to a mental health hospital. He didn't object this time. The police were well trained and nice. Me and my husband's mother accompanied him to the hospital. Thanks to what I learned from MHACC, we were able to let my husband stay at the hospital a couple of days longer , which is very helpful .\" Person B said: \"Hi Elaine, thank you so much for your care of my daughter and my family. My daughter has recovered from a severe mental health issue. Now, she is health both mentally and physically. She has become a teacher. She is happy everyday about her life and her career. It is a real blessing for us to have a caring MHACC family.\" Person C said: \"Hi Elaine, I would like to tell you some good news. My younger brother is willing to take the shots now. Given time, he should re cover, I am sure. Thank you for your guidance over the time. And many thanks to the support groups.\" Many of the people we helped became passionate volunteers for our organization. For the younger people, we not only try to help them recover, but also hel p them become productive member in society. For example, Mr. Lo had suffered from mental health issues for many years. Last year, he participated in our mental health facilitator training class. After the class, he became a leader in our Peer -to-Peer suppo rt group and then went on to help us with writing reports and grant applications. VI.

As a result, weCOMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES233 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGsecured a major grant, the Stop the Hate grant.

At the same time, we will utilize our newly developed mobile mental health apps, MiSunshine and UrSpace to serve even more people and make mental health resources more accessible.COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES234 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGOUTREACH / ENGAGEMENT & SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT (OESD) REPORT OESD #: OESD 18 PROVIDER NAME: National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) NAMI EAST BAY -East Bay Chapters PROGRAM NAME: Capacity Building & Family Empowerment Program Description: NAMI EastBay has as its mission goal to support, educate, advocate, promote research, network, explore alternative perspectives and to overcome the stigma surrounding mental illness. We attempt to accomplish this through a weekly support group, every other month spe aker meeting where a general relevant topic is presented, every other month 5 -page newsletter, Mail Chimp (bulk mail) alerts, website and responsively to phone calls and email inquiries and requests. Target Population: Our programs are geared towards the n eeds of families or friends of loved ones with mental illness. Although there is generally no direct intervention with the individuals with lived experience, hopefully the improvement in the family's understanding of and knowledge of the illness and approp riate resources, along with communication strategies and the knowledge that the family is not alone with their challenges will help alleviate the accompanying challenges and frustrations . How Much Did We Do? I. FY 21/22: a.Number of Unique Clients Served: Estimated 108 unique clients. This is a bit tricky since oftentimes we're dealing with a family rather than a single individual. This last year, we offered a weekly support group. Of the participants, there were generally 7 or 8 attendees who have attended on a weekly basis and each meeting brought in 2-3 newcomers. A follow-up note is sent after each meeting with elaboration of acronyms, book recommendations, specific phone contact numbers, website addresses and descriptions of services. Program budget: $10,580 In addition, o ur newsletter is sent via email to approximately 1 ,110 recipients and the paper newsletter is mailed to 350 recipients . Our office receives approximately 3 -5 inquiries and requests a week via email or phone calls. How Well Did We Do? II. Please Describe Ways that the Program Strives to: a.Reduce Mental Health Stigma: We rely heavily on the concept that stigma is based on a lack of knowledge about or misunderstanding of mental illness. The very fact of being in a group where problems are shared and understood seems to be a solid first step. We use some humor where appro priate and share insights or comments from our ill relatives which help to develop empathy in those families who are totally distressed and unable to use that perspective. Oftentimes, where appropriate, we learn to identify predictable emotions and normali ze such issues as a consumer feeling frightened and scared when internal demons and voices areCOMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES235 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGthreatening. Via a comfortable relaxed process, we become familiar with cultural differences in how families deal with crisis. b.Create a Welcoming Environment: Before the pandemic , we'd greet support group attendees with coffee and cookies. That's not possible these days since we work on Zoom, but the intent is there. Realizing that for many family members, coming to a group and sharing one's struggles is a dauntin g task so we give extra attention and welcome to new attendees. Seasoned group members kindly reach out and speak to the benefits of coming to group and this message is conveyed repeatedly in the chat room. Folks are encouraged to unmute on Zoom so everyon e is free to interact. III. Language Capacity for this Program: Our groups and printed materials use English but we freely give out the contact information for groups where Spanish or Mandarin/Cantonese is used. Our website provides onscreen translation. IV. FY 21/22 challenges: It goes without saying that these last two years have been heavily impacted by Covid. We transferred over to the Zoom process but realize that still leaves many families unable to access us. Another challenge has been the underlying presence of general societal anxiety and depression due in part to Covid but also to geopolitical issues. These are tough times. Is anyone better off? V.FY 21/22 Client Impact: We do not currently offer direct services to clients. Instead, in our quest to have the system view our families as part of the support team, we feel that bringing our folks up to steam on what mental illness is, community resources and how the system works, our families can become more credible team members. And this benefits the clients, as do the communication skills and coping strategies we teach. VI. FY 21/22 Additional Information: N/A VII. FY 22/23 - 25/26 Projections of Clients to be Served: We imagine we will maintain a similar base number of 100+ client and family participa nts but anticipate offering direct consumer groups, which will increase numbers. We are seeing an increasing number of support group referrals coming to us from Kaiser and private and county clinicians. VIII. FY 22/23 Programs or Service Changes: We are anticipating a change in the affiliate long-term leadership and we are contemplating some changes to the organization but will still be offering our support and education outreach. Because of the labor intensity of producing the newsletter, we will be stopping the production of hard copies. We will be relying on electronic bulk mail and intend to use that more with paper accommodations made for those members who are not comfortable with technology. We will be hiring a part time tech person who will maintain and troubleshoot our zoom, website, social media and mail processes. We will also be increasing the hours and responsibilities of our part time office manager. Lastly, we will be expanding our board and putting in place an advisory board of subject/ resource specialists.COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES236 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGOUTREACH / ENGAGEMENT & SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT (OESD) REPORT OESD #: OESD 18 PROVIDER NAME: National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) Easy Bay Chapters - NAMI Tri - Valley.

Please Describe Ways that the Program Strives to: a.Redu ce Mental Health Stigma: NAMI Tri- Valley provides information, support, advocacy, resources and the time to listen to any person who seeks any or all of these services, which are all important factors in dispelling stigma. We have received comments from pa rticipants that have attended some of the programs listed in this report, which is testimony to the dedicated services we provide: Family -to-Family Education Class: \"This class offered an environment that felt safe to share our raw emotions and situations and felt supported and not judged.\" \"It was comforting to see we are not the only ones dealing with these types of issues in our family.\" \"Because I have been attending support groups for quite a while I would not say I have had an 'aha' moment. But one t hing that did stand out was the exercise where many people were reading at the same time, while we were to listen to and follow directions. That really gave me a better understanding of the chaos that can be going on in the mind of my loved one with mental illness.\" \"I have shared much of the information with other family members hoping to help them educate themselves and put some of this into practice= understanding and empathy being the key.\" Suicide Prevention Workshop for Family Caregivers : \"I'm pretty sure we are zooming for the long haul - and I look forward to this workshop next year.\"COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES237 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG\"Awesome job!

Thank you!!\" NAMI Connection s Recovery Support Group : \"Finding a community of people who understand mental health that's been judgment free has helped me immensely especially during the pandemic.\" One long -time attendee said \"It was the social interactions that have helped.\" Family Support Group : \"You are such a gem and lifeline for all of us in our challenges, with your mother hen wing over us, guiding and supporting us all through our journeys! You should know you make a world of difference to lots and lots of people including me! Bless you for doing what you do and being who you are. People matter. It shows in your heart. \" \"Thank you , Marsha for this email and all the thoughtful support you, Lisa and Mark provided us. It helped us so much. Being with members who truly understand... very grateful!\" b.Create a Welcoming Environment: We greet and treat all participants in all of our programs with dignity and respect. Often the initial contact with NAMI Tri -Valley is a phone call. We promptly answe r most all calls and many have commented that we are the only organization that has picked up the phone right away. Zoom video conferencing has been our main source of delivery of our services during FY 21-22. Not all are comfortable with this venue, but most work around the various challenges. Since we have recently rented office space for the first time, we are able to safely conduct small support groups in the conference room that is available for our use, which has made a world of difference for those who do not do as well using Zoom. III. Language Capacity for this Program: English language is the primary language used, however, we are in the process of starting a Spanish language Family Support Group in October of 2022. IV. FY 21/22 challenges: Living with COVID -19 through FY21 -22 has converted all of our activities to Zoom video conferencing, which has had its challenges as well as its successes such as the ability for NAMI Tri-Valley to continue helping people. One challenge for us is in accurate tracking of who is a repeat participant and who is there for the first time. Often a person will call in on a support group but prefer to listen only, no audio, no video and does not wish to introduce themselves. That is fine with us, but for tracking purposes, we are starting to make a note of that. Soon, we plan to hold one (1) support group per month on Zoom and 1 support group per month in person. We will test out how that will work including looking at hybrid set ups (in -person & Zoom). Is an yone Client Impact: service areas include Livermore, Dublin and Pleasanton. These areas are historically underserved when it comes to psycho -social programs for peers and their families. NAMI Tri -Valley has develo ped multiple support groups in order to strengthen the support ofCOMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES238 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGthe family members so that they may be a better safety net for their loved ones living with mental health conditions. We are also exploring housing possibilities for mental health clients i n East Alameda County, as well as increasing public awareness on suicide prevention. All of these projects improve lives in our communities. VI.FY 21/22 Additional Information: The programs listed under Section I. have differences. For example, the support group count for return participants and new participants, however the Suicide Prevention Workshop for Family Caregivers is a once a year event and must register in advance. Equally so for the Family-to -Family class, all attendees must register and all are unique clients. VII. FY 22/23 - 25/26 Projections of Clients to be Served: We anticipate increased attendance when we resume in-person meetings, approximately 159 for each fiscal year. VIII. IX.FY 22/23 Programs or Service Changes: In October, 2022, we will be starting a Family Support Group in Spanish. This group is projected to be held every 3rd Monday evening. This has been a long- time dream to provide a group for the Hispanic community in East Alameda County.

Please Describe Ways that the Program Strives to: a.Reduce Mental Health Stigma: Every aspect of the PEERS WRAP program is designed to eliminate stigma. The program is peer led, so all staff involved in the program have lived experience, serving as models of recovery and resilience. A key principle of WRAP is to avoid clinical or diagnostic language, so no one needs to identif y with stigmatizing diagnostic categories in order to participate. Moreover, the program is strengths based and emphasizes participants' agency and capacity for recovery. b.Create a Welcoming Environment: Communicating warmth and welcoming participants is a priority for PEERS. Through our annual Peer Program Participant survey, 96 percent of respondents agreed or strongly agreed with the statement \"Staff greet me warmly when I attend the program,\" a figure that remained consistent since before we began remote programming during the pandemic. III. Language Capacity for this Program: Two of our WRAP groups are conducted in Spanish and the rest are in English. IV. FY 21/22 challenges: Our major struggle with our WRAP deliverables this past year was low attenda nce. We tried many outreach strategies, from email to Instagram to reaching out to personal connections to encourage participation. We are sensing fatigue with remote groups. In FY 22 -23, we plan to resume in -person WRAP groups with some of our longstandin g partner agencies, including South County Homeless Project, La Familia Counseling Center, and East Bay Community Recovery Project. We hope that this increases the number of participants, though ongoing pandemic concerns might make people reluctant to gath er in larger groups.COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES242 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGIs anyone better off? V.FY 21/22 Client Impact : Ninety-four percent of WRAP participants reported that the group was useful to them, 90% reported that the group helped them understand more about their mental health and wellness, and 91% reported that the group helped them have hope. A sample comment on our evaluation survey is \"I like hearing others' answers - helps me feel normal.\" An example of impact on a single participant is that an older adult African American man with mental health and substance use challenges shared on several occasions how the WRAP key recovery concepts (hope, personal responsibility, education, self-advocacy, and support) helped him through some difficult challenges. He expressed gratitude that PEERS was providing this group at the site and often shared that out in his everyday life he could always remember the recovery concepts and that thinking about them helped him to not drink, or reminded him he was welcome even if he had been drinking over the weekend. VI. FY 21/22 Additional Information: N/A VII.

All clients must meet specialty mental health criteria with impairments in the moderate to severe range. All clients are referred by Alameda County Acute Crisis Care and Evaluations for Sys tem-Wide Services (ACCESS). Services are provided in North County, South County and East County, located in Oakland, Union City and Pleasanton. How Much Did We Do? I. FY 21/22: Unique Clients Served: per client: $693 How Well Did We Do? II. Please Describe Ways that the Program Strives to: a.Reduce Mental Health Stigma: We reduce mental health stigma by hiring diverse staff that is culturally competent, and who understand, embody, and implement the standards of the MHSA model of care. This includes a commitme nt to r educe mental health stigma through utilizing client -centered assessment, streng thbased services, trauma- informed care, and culturally competent training within the psychiatric and social -behavioral frameworks of mental health care. We had several r ecruitment strategies and processes which encouraged more diverse providers to apply to work for Pathways, despite the decrease in available providers in community mental health . [In July 2021 it was reported that there were approximately 30,312 psychiatrists in the U.S. About half of the psychiatrists in the U.S. to maintain private practices and many psychiatrists work in multiple settings leaving massive shortages for psychiatrists per state.] Pathways continues to be dedicated to r educing ment al health stigma through utilizingCOMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES244 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGclient -centered assessment, streng thbased services, trauma- informed care , and culturally competent training. We were also able to continue to improve our engagement services and show rates with our African American menta lly ill clients. This group also continues to be the largest ethnic group that we serve each month. b.Create a Welcoming Environment: Our welcoming environment includes providing client -driven comprehensive community based specialty mental health services. We support adults ages 18 years and older living with a serious mental illness, at risk of or experiencing homelessness, who may also have a co occurring substance use disorder, and/or who ma y be engaged in the criminal justice system. Our services implement a phased approach with the provision of intensive services during the early phase of treatment. When applicable, we see clients frequently within their first 90 days in order to ensure the y are out of crisis and stabilized on their medications, and have community resources. Our waiting rooms are set up so that clients may experience a welcome home environment with decaf coffee and water provided daily, special food luncheons once a month, c lothing and food drives, as well as our yearly mental health picnic for clients, and our consumer council that encourages participation from consumers. Clients are provided with art supplies while they wait for their appointments and are met with our engag ement team to ensure they have their needs met and are welcomed. III. Language Capacity for this Program: We have several staff who speak different languages including : Spanish, Farsi, Tagalog, Hindi, and Arabic. IV. FY 21/22 challenges: We have been sti ll providing services to our clients despite being in a national pandemic for over 2.5 years. Clients are feeling the burden of being in a pandemic and a higher level of suicidality is being expressed among clients. Client referrals have increased in inten sity and severity. More time and attention were required with existing open cases as anxiety, depression, substance use and overall acuity levels increased during the pandemic. Staffing shortages, unexpected COVID spreads and adherence to the COVID reim bursement requirements for all staff (especially professional level staff) while recover from COVID has definitely impacted our fee for service contract especially with the fixed costs associated with the running the program. Another challenge was the need for Pathways Providers to take on higher caseloads sporadically throughout the year to ensure that all clients were properly cared for until staff recovered from COVID. Is anyone better off? V. FY 21/22 Client Impact: During the year 202 1-2022, we impacted clients by serving them throughout the entire year by utilizing telemedicine services. We continue to provide services despite the pandemic and have reduced rates of no-shows and timeliness with appointments due to our telemedicine outreach. We have been able to accommodate all referrals with appointments within 7 days or under who are discharged from the hospital. This year our referral to admission time has improved due to hiring an Intake physician. We have continued to provide ongoing ser vices to patients using telemedicine and in -person services. These services continue to reach clients who are struggling with serious mental health. We continued to encourage and provide protection to clients with risk to COVID19 including offering a healt h fair COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES245 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGproviding vaccinations, anti -bacterial and hand sanitizer products, masks, health check -ups, and health education. Throughout the year, we increased client access to vaccinations which contributed to less exposure to COVID19. We increased our outr each to outside providers coordinating medical records and health objectives. We connected 82% of our total clients connected with a Primary Care Physician. We reduced the number of psychiatric hospitalizations of clients enrolled in Pathways by 80%+ this fiscal year compared to last year. We reduced hospitalizations by offering more therapy, case management, extra appointments, and providing assessments for higher levels of care as needed. Clients who are of a higher acuity are increasing through the refe rral process. Client -Centered Psychiatric Assessment is an ongoing service activity of gathering and analyzing collaborative information with the client. Together we help the client build community resources by using tertiary interventions to reduce harm and increase resiliency. Assessments incorporate a review of medical necessity, mental status determination, and analysis of the client's clinical history by gathering relevant cultural issues, analysis of behaviors and interpersonal skills, and a review o f family dynamics and diagnosis. Our assessments capture the client's comprehensive social cultural lens by recognizing the daily stressors a client may go through especially if they are from an underserved population. Utilizing a social justice perspective of how race, class, culture, sexual orientation, and gender identity impact a person's expression of symptoms and we ensure that clients are diagnosed correctly. We account for the impact of how these qualifiers can drive diagnosis including African Amer icans being disproportionally diagnosed with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders when instead they have a trauma disorder. We at Pathways to Wellness differentiate between cultural and functional paranoia in symptoms and encourage an accurate portr ayal of client symptoms. By focusing on what the client is experiencing in the world as who they are, we can differentiate between what is the client's symptom and what is the malady of systemic racism. This way, we can treat the person and not the illness of the institutions which they continually encounter. In alignment with the MHSA standards of treatment and care, Pathways to Wellness utilizes trauma - informed care which includes program participant empowerment and choice, collaboration among service providers and systems, and ensuring physical and emotional safety and trustworthiness for program participants. When a client has been exposed to abuse, neglect, discrimination, violence, and adverse experiences, they are at risk for health -related issues especially mental health complications. By acknowledging t he client's life experiences, our providers improve patient engagement, treatment adherence, medication management, and potential mental health recovery. Our Strengths -Based Model uses a set of values and philosophy of practice that encourages clients to become experts in their own mental health recovery. This includes the potential to recover from adversity through mutually identified strengths, community resources, and other opportunities. Program staff and providers assist clients in assessing their st rengths, establishing meaningful goals, and developing a recovery plan. Pathways to Wellness encourages program clients to recover from mental health and reclaim their lives. We focus on client strengths rather than deficits to increase self -worth and enha nce the potential for mental health recovery. We encourage the participant to be an expert of their own recovery. We encourage a collective treatment approach as primary and essential while working together as copartners. We provide ongoing culturally r esponsive trainings for our staff and our communities at large to better engage and serve African American consumers which represents the largest client population at COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES246 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGPathways. These trainings are provided to both our staff and to our community. We train p roviders about the complexity of trauma within the African American population and how to best serve their psychiatric and biopsychosocial needs. VI.FY 21/22 Additional Information: We were able to improve the number of services provided by creating organization related to telemedicine. As a result, we were able to encourage on-time services with a much lower no-show rate. We also transitioned fully onto an electronic medical records system which reduces wait times when sharing a client's chart between providers and staff. We also still continue to struggle with discharging high volumes of clients to lower levels of care due to the inability of PCPs to take our clients . VII. FY 22/23 Projections of Clients to be current capitated - Programs or Service Changes: We are providing ongoing telemedicine and in- person services. We will continue to provide services within 10 days or less for all new referrals and less than 7 days for all clients coming out of the psychiatric hospital. In addition, we will operate under the new guidelines of \"No Wrong Door\". Nevertheless, under our existing capitated reimbursement structure, Pathways anticipates serving 2,800 clients next fiscal year. However, Pathways believes that without the capitated contract and with appropriate rates for our outpatient specialty health program, the county would see an increase in capacity and improvements in overall care from Pathways. In addition, as clients increase in severity our communit y, we will continue to see an increase in behavioral health needs which will result in demand for immediate access for psychiatry, therapy and case management services in an effort to keep clients out of crisis. Proactive planning, accessibility and resour ces will be needed by all providers who are able to deliver quality care to higher numbers than usual.

Services are designed to enhance the lives of individuals living with mental illness and guide them on their healing process. The mission of STEPS is to facilitate the transition of high risk, hard -to-place Alameda County Behavioral Health clients into the community while reducing their length of stay in Alameda County psychiatric facilities. Target Population: Adults (ages 18 -59) diagnosed with a se vere mental illness. STEPS' goal is to serve high utilizers of Alameda County mental health services. Members referred to STEPS will have utilized at least three psychiatric emergency room visits and/or at least one month of inpatient psychiatric care with in the past year. Priority will be given to members who have met these criteria for 2 years in a row. How Much Did We Do? I. FY 21/22: a.Number of Unique Clients Served: 55. Cost per client: $12,008 How Well Did We Do? II. Please Describe Ways that the Program Strives to: a.Reduce Mental Health Stigma: We address internalized stigma by treating clients as individuals, getting to know them as humans through direct conversations and whole person assessments, learning their psychosocial histories, understanding the reasons behind their challenges, learning their strengths and creating individualized treatment goals that come from client's hopes and dreams. We provide clients with education about their mental health and substance use symptoms that can increase understanding and a sense of control over their lives. We educate about ways that stigma from society may impact their own self perceptions. We are with clients side -by-side in the community which allows us to advocate for fair treatment, as well as model for community members, how to interact with people who are experiencing symptoms of mental health diagnoses in real time We work with family members and other loved ones to provide psychoeducation and skill building about how to interact with clients in ways that minimize stigm atization. We provide ongoing training and support to help staff recognize own internalized biases and minimize potential microaggressions towards clients b.Create a Welcoming Environment: Almost all of our services are provided in the community, where our clients are located. We have a receptionist who answers calls with respect andCOMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES248 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGensures that clients' stated needs are forwarded to their team. We have staff on -site all day, every day (M -F) to address the needs of clients who come to the office looking for support. We host client -focused events that honor and welcome our clients, to help them feel like integral members of society. We provide training to staff around ways to create a we lcoming environment and ways to provide support with welcoming attitudes. III. Language Capacity for this Program: STEPS program uses a language line to provide services in the language our partners require or prefer. 53 Clients were served in English and 2 served in Mandarin/Cantonese . IV. FY 21/22 challenges: FY21/22 was a time of great uncertainty due to the stressors of the global pandemic, housing insecurity, increased risk of substance use, increase of hate crimes directed towards vulnerable populations, increased cost of livng, especially for housing and food. While all these factors impacted our clients, the most challenging of the past year were the shortage of safe, affordable housing, increased cost of living due to inflation, and the da ngerous risk of overdose and death due to the easy accessiblity of fentanyl and other street drugs. We have also continued to struggle in FY21/22 with our referral flow. Traditionally the majority of STEPS referrals came from Villa Fairmont, however, Vill a has seen an increase in FSP partners coming to Villa and those individuals are ineligible for STEPS services. We have increased our admissions through community referrals (direct from Alameda County service teams) which has led to a increase in LOS for partners in STEPS over the last year due to housing instability. Is anyone better off? V. FY 21/22 Client Impact: \"Jane\" is a single mother of spent two years with the STEPS program due poor symptom management, complex medical needs and barriers to engag ing in treatment. She struggled with frequent suicidal thoughts, depressive symptoms, voices, and PTSD, which made it difficult for her to maintain treatment engagement with her primary case management team, manage ADLs, or manage her medical needs. She w as pregnant and had diabetes at the time of admission. With the help of STEPS case management service, she was able to reach a place of medication stability with her primary CM team and improve consistency on attending medical follow up appointments. When Jane struggled to maintain treatment engagement with psychiatry, STEPS support her in attending treatment meetings and accessing services. STEPS assisted Jane with advocating for a change in treatment teams due to some very triggering events near her CM c linic, which were creating an additional barrier to engaging in treatment. Eventually her Service Level CM services were transferred to another program closer to where she lived and away from the triggering location. STEPS assisted Jane with building rappo rt and establishing consistency in engagement and treatment with her new treatment team. Due to her symptoms and history of trauma, Jane struggled to engage in community supports, struggled to trust providers, and struggled to maintain engagement with her treatment teams. STEPS CM team consistency, longevity, and approach to service helped build a strong connection, which fostere d trust and openness with Jane. During her time with STEPS, Jane successfully completed pregnancy and gave birth to a healthy baby. STEPS assisted Jane with transportation, managing her medication, supported her in attending her COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES249 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGmedical appointments, provided psychoeducation around the i mportance of medical care for both her and the baby, and provided coaching on grounding skills to reduce symptoms of anxiety, suicidal thoughts, healthy coping for triggering thoughts, and paranoia. Jane was also connected to CM services for her baby and S TEPS was able to support her in maintaining treatment engagement with this CM as well. Jane is a section 8 housing recipient and needed support with communicating her needs with her landlord to support a healthy and safe environment for her family. STEPS s upported Jane in advocating for service and maintenance at her home. STEPS also supported Jane in moving to a new, larger home after the birth of the baby. STEPS was able to support Jane's housing stability when she fell behind on rent using the housing su bsidiary funds provided by MHSA funding. VI. FY 21/22 Additional Information: STEPS was provided a housing budget this past year in response to the need from many new referrals who were either homeless, at risk of homelessness, or not connected with benefits resulting in a barrier for discharge to the comunity from inpatient setting s. In FY 21/22, STEPS supported 7 partners with securing and maintaining stable, supportive, long -term housing. This reduced their risks of rehospitalization, homelessness, risks to safety, and grave disability.

VIII. FY 22/23 Programs or Service Changes: STEPS will continue to work with Alameda County around referral streams and ways STEPS can support both our at-risk populations and the larger ACBHCS system flow. We are exploring providing support for partners during their transition from FSP level services to Service team levels of service, as this transition time can be challenging and a critical linkage time. We are also continuing to explore ways to support individuals transitioning from TAY services to the adult system of care.COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES250 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGOUTREACH / ENGAGEMENT & SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT (OESD) REPORT OESD #: OESD 20 PROVIDER NAME: Alameda County Behavioral Health, Vocational Services Division PROGRAM NAME: Vocational Program - Individual Placement and Support (IPS) Program Description: The ACBH Vocational Program (ACVP) is a county operated direct service program which is part of the Alameda County Behavioral Health System of Care. ACVP is one of four units under the umbrella of the Vocational Services Division (Including units for Supporte d Employment Training and Technical Assistance, CalWORKs Mental Health, Administrative and ACVP Direct Service). ACVP is imbedded in 1 8 county operated and community based specialty mental health programs (including Children's Specialized Services, Condit ional Release, Lifelong TRUST Clinic, Lifelong Supportive Housing, Asian Health Services, Casa Del Sol, La Familia, Fred Finch Youth Center, West Oakland Health Clinic). The model of Supported Employment used by ACVP is evidence -based Individual Placemen t and Support (IPS). Our service approach is to partner with program participants and engage them around their unique interests and needs in finding a job, meet them in their community to identify employers, obtain and retain jobs, while continuing to col laborate with their clinical team and significant others to aid in their success. After a consumer is working, ACVP continues to work with them until the job is secure and the individual is satisfied with the job match. If they want a different job or lo se the one secured, we keep working with them as long as they are interested and motivated to work. The IPS Supported Employment model follows these core practice principles: 1. Focus on Competitive Employment: Agencies providing IPS services are commit ted to competitive employment as an attainable goal for people with behavioral health conditions seeking employment. Mainstream education and specialized training may enhance career paths. 2. Eligibility Based on Client Choice: People are not excluded on the basis of readiness, diagnoses, symptoms, substance use history, psychiatric hospitalizations, homelessness, level of disability, or legal system involvement. 3. Integration of Rehabilitation and Mental Health Services: IPS programs are closely integrat ed with mental health treatment teams. 4. Attention to Worker Preferences: Services are based on each person's preferences and choices, rather than providers' judgments. 5. Personalized Benefits Counseling: Employment specialists help people obtain persona lized, understandable, and accurate information about their Social Security, Medicaid, and other government entitlements. 6. Rapid Job Search: IPS programs use a rapid job search approach to help job seekers obtain jobs directly, rather than providing leng thy pre - employment assessment, training, and counseling. If further education is part of their plan, IPS specialists assist in these activities as needed. 7. Systematic Job Development: Employment specialists systematically visit employers, who are selecte d based on job seeker preferences, to learn about their business needs and hiring preferences. 8. Time -Unlimited and Individualized Support: Job supports are individualized and continue for as long as each worker wants and needs the support. Target Populat ion: Alameda County Specialty Mental Health Clients - Assist ing youth (16 -17 years old), Transitional Age Youth (TAY - 18-24 years old), Adults (18 -54 years old) and Older Adults ( 55+ years old) in finding and keeping competitive work , utilizing the evide nce-based practice of Individual Place and Support (IPS) - Supported Employment. IPS services span across all of Alameda County. How Much Did We Do? I. FY 21/22:COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES251 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGa.Number of Unique Clients Served: 260, Cost per client: $15,984 How Well Did We Do? II. Please Describe Ways that the Program Strives to: a.Reduce Mental Health Stigma: The majority of individuals (~65% according to NAMI studies) with serious mental illness (SMI) receiving specialty mental health services express a desire to work, yet within the ACBH systems of care, fewer than 3% of people with serious mental illness have access to evidenced -based IPS employment services. The employment rate of specialty mental health consumers in California is estimated to be only 10% (SAMHSA 2015). In other words, 90% of consumers are un employed (as compared to only 3% of the general regional population according to June 2022 Bureau of Labor Statistics reporting ). To compound matters, an even smaller fraction of employed consumers with SMI are actually working full -time. Facts such as th ese only reinforce the widespread stigma that mental health consumers are \"too sick,\" \"too unreliable/unpredictable,\" or \"too dangerous\" to work. Because of employment related stigma, consumers have historically been steered toward volunteer positions or sheltered work where they are paid a fraction of minimum wage while performing trivial assignments/tasks. They are generally isolated from the rest of the workforce, further worsening their experience of stigma. Fortunately, in September 2021 CA Senate Bill 639 was signed into law, which will phase out the use of Section 214 (c)(1)(A) of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) (i.e. certificate for allowance of subminimum employment wages for people with disabilities) and ultimately prohibit paying workers w ith disabilities less than the $15.00 California minimum wage . These workers will be transitioned to competitive, integrated employment. ACVP staff were members of a workgroup headed by the CA State Council on Developmental Disabilities, whose goal was to raise awareness and support to SB 639 prior to it being signed into law. The ACBH IPS programs help consumers enhance their lives by supporting people fulfill a universal human need of having purpose. Like anyone else, work helps boost program participant s' self-esteem , provides an opportunity to be active in the workforce, and to be contributing societal members. At work, consumers have an opportunity to develop meaningful relationships with co -workers and to engage with the public. Through work, consumers are able to dispel the fear, uncertainty and doubt that can be directed toward them. Employment Specialists help reduce stigma as well, by introducing employers to qualified employees who can contribute to their businesses in many ways. Consumer job seekers and employees, along with IPS workers are ambassadors of mental health. They help reduce stigma in workplace settings every day. Lastly, ACVP Leadership has been asked to participate on a state facilitated Workforce and Employment Committee to discuss best practices for employment services for the SMI population. This will provide an opportunity for advocacy and promotion of competitive job development strategies, using IPS evidenced based approaches, for all mental health clients in the state. b.Create a Welcoming Environment: ACBH Vocational Services strives to create a welcoming environment and promote the idea that work supports recovery. Pre-COVID, ACVP would host annual gatherings with program participants , mental health workers and natura l supports toCOMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES252 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGcelebrate employment successes of IPS Program participants throughout the ACBH system during the Annual IPS Participant Celebration event. This annual event highlights people's achievement and progress toward their employment goals, and also acts to inspire others to consider obtaining and maintaining competitive/mainstream employment as part of their wellness. Consumer Back -to-Work testimonials, catered lunch, raffle prizes, and inspiration stations are all typically part of the event. In th e everyday work, Vocational Services workers embrace the philosophy of figuratively and literally \"meeting people where they are\" . That is, workers understand the importance of building relationships with consumers through understanding their values, lens through which they view the world, their unique style and personality, needs, emotions, dreams for a better future, and connecting in a way that is effective for them. Vocational Services workers do this by listening, observing, affirming, and asking quest ions at the right time. To reduce logistical barriers and ensure consumers feel safe and secure, workers meet with people in community settings largely determined by consumer preference. III. Language Capacity for this Program: ACBH Vocational Services h as on staff direct service providers who are native speakers of Spanish, Korean and Tagalog. Services are provided to consumers regardless of language capacity (incl. sign language services for people who are deaf or hard of hearing), and make use of the a vailable \"Language Line\" interpretation or sign language interpretation services as necessary. IV. FY 21/22 challenges: Maintaining adequate staffing levels continues to be a universal challenge across our system of care. As of FY end, 10 ou t of 19 (over 50%) direct service and supervisory permanent positions in ACVP were vacant. Of these 10 vacant positions, the unit was able to utilize non- permanent employees from the HRS \"TAP\" (Temporary Assingment Pool), Provisional, Retiree - Annuitant, an d Clinical Intern groups while the parallel civil service process for hiring permanent employees advance d. In addition to this, the ongoing effects of COVID have also negatively affected service penetration rates among referring partner programs, as the ge neral focus on employment and education as a key intervention and service has diminished with many case managment services being offered on the phone and clients having more concerns of leaving their homes and getting infected. Is anyone better off? V.FY 21/22 Client Impact: On a monthly average ACVP has a 38% job placement rate (up from 28% prior year). Competitive employment rate percentage is the number of clients in the IPS program who worked a competitive job in the community (monthly average working n=42) divided by the total number of people in the IPS program (monthly average n=112) . Benchmarks set by the Westat IPS Collaborative include 30% fair standard, 40% good standard, and 50% exemplary standard. ACVP helped consumers start 95 new jobs during the FY 21/22 as well as maintain 49 positions with existing employers, for a total of 144 jobs (see list of employers and positions at the end of report) . VI. FY 21/22 Additional Information: N/A VII. of Clients to be Served: ACVP is projected to serve 280+ clients in each fiscal years. In July 2022, 112 unique clients were served. On average over the past 6 months, there have been 10 new enrollments each month (projected enrollments: 11 months remaining x 10 enrollments = 110). In addition, ACVP anticipates hiring 2 vacant ES positions, increasing capacity for at least 60 more clients. Total projected: 112 served + 110 new enrollments + 60 additional ES capacity =282.COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES253 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGVIII. FY 22/23 Programs or Service Change s: ACVP hopes to fully staff all direct service vacancies by FY3Q and introduce services into the ACBH Substance Use Disorder (SUD) system of Care and within the ACBH Specialty Mental Health Forensic Division , and to expand service capacity into the suppor ted housing programs under Health Care Services Agency . Certain partner providers have also demonstrated high levels of interest and demand for service - For example, the Lifelong Supported Housing program has generated enough interest and potential client pipeline to justify assigning two employment specialists to the program, doubling capacity from serving 10 to 20 at any given time.

The counselor provides information about Social Secur ity work incentives and rules and can meet multiple times with the consumer if needed. We believe each person is their own best decision-maker, so do not dictate what consumers should do, but provide information, resources and support to them. A consumer can have an in-office appointment with the WIB counselor or meet via phone or video, whichever is their p reference. III.Language Capac ity for this Program: Although all services were provided in English, C IL's Work Incentiv e Benefits counselor can utiliz e Langua ge Line to provide support in multiple langua ges. The counselor can also provide links to and/or copies of Work In centive benef its information in Sp anish. IV.FY 21/22 challenges: The ongoing pandemic has continued to impact the numb ers of IPS program partici pants actively seeking employment in 21-22 and the varying degrees of social-distancing protocols thro ughout the year h ave also impacted the numbers of in-person service provision. The num bers and program were also affected by Geoff Evans leaving his WIB position at CIL in mid-April for another position within ACB HC. Robin Earth, a CIL program manager, took over Geoff Evan's position, on a temporary basis, while CIL searc hed to hire a new WIB counselor for the ACBH S position. The hiring search was cha llenging and took longer than expected due to the pandemic and due to the specific skills req uired for this position. CIL hired a new WIB counselor, Caolan Hyland, for this ACBHC contract position in July. (Robin is current ly assisti ng Caolan during this transition period.) The quarterly n umbers decr eased in COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES257 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGthe 4th quarter, as well as the number of contacts with wellness cent ers, due to the loss of WIB counselor Geoff Evans and the l ength of time required to hire a new WIB counselor. Is anyone better off? V.FY 21/22 Client Impact: While sig nificant numbers of participants are engaged in employment, all partici pants who have received Work Incent ives Benefits C ounseling have learned important information about how Social Security Disability benefits and Medi-Cal p rograms function and learned the rules and reg ulations sur rounding earned income, asset limits, best practices for reporting income and asset management strategies. These learn ed skil ls are im portant f or navi gating terface b etween e mployment and benefi ts and help to reduce a reluctance to pursue employment due to fear of losing benefits, and enco urage confidence towards building an increas ed independence and ability to manage personal responsibilities. Here are 2 typical outcomes of WIBC services: A partici pant who was not working yet was referred to the WIB program by an Employment counselor from one of the wellness centers . He had SS I and Medi-Cal and was thinking about working , and was worried about possibly losing his SSI and Medi-Cal if he worked. I ( Robin Ea rth) informed him that approximately only half of his monthly earnings would be deducted from his SSI monthly payment, the importance of reporting to SSA when you start or stop work and the amount of monthly earn ings by the 6th of each month, how to do report earn ings, and that he ultimately would have a combined higher total income. I also informed him that his Medi-Cal could continue under 1619b if his SSI payment went to zero due to work earnings, as long as he still had the same medical condition, and kept his resources under $2000. I let him know that he could contact me again if he had questions. Although he said he was only at the \"gatherin g information\" point, and wasn't su re yet about working, he said the information was helpful, especiall y about Medi-Cal. He also knew he could contact me again if he had more questions. A partici pant was working part-time, and wanted to know how many more hours he could work before his SSDI benefits would be affect ed. He did not want to lose his benefits. He had already used all his Trial Work Period. I informed h im that the 2022 SGA limit was $1,350 and that as long as he stayed u nder SGA, and was still medically eligible, his benefits should continue. I also informed him about the \"Exped ited Reinsta tement\" 5-year safety net, for recipients who lose their benefits due to earnings above SGA, and then have to stop working or work less due to the same impairment. I also informed him about best ways of reporting his monthly earnings to SSA. The outcome is that he became more knowled geable about the SGA limit and reporting his earnings to SSA to avoid overpayments, which will al low him to better determine whet her and how much to increase his work hours.

She first reported this to her psychiatrist during a telemedicine visit. She denied self -harming to remove the bugs and denied methamphetamine use. The psychiatrist connected her to a walk -in appointment with a PCP the next day to rule ou t possible infection vs. delusional parasitosis. She was seen the next day and given Ivermectin to treat a possible scabies infestation, although no bugs were observed.

The PCCs are situated between primary care settings and behavioral health settings, often managing the warm hand - offs between departments and facilitating conversations around clients' ment al health needs . The PCCs have been trained in addressing sensitive mental health topics, providing appropriate behavioral health resources and support, and practicing cultural humility when supporting their clients' mental health. Alameda Health Consortium also connected the PCCs to the following mental health- related trainings: 1.ACEs/PEARLS training with Dr. Dayna Long and Artanesha JacksonCOMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES266 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG2.Behavioral Health Landscape Overview with Sun Hyung Lee and Christine Mukai from Alameda County Behavioral Health 3.Training on having difficult conversations with Shoshana Rosenberg, LCSW at LifeLong Medical Care 4.Meeting and Greet with Dr. Madeline Lansky, Pediatric Psychiatry Consultant, PCPCP Team (Primary Care Psychiatry Consultation Program ) with Alameda County Behavioral Health Care Services b.Create a Welcoming Environment: Our team of P CCs have been dedicated to creating welcoming environments and building trusting relationships with their clients and families. In addition to learning how to navigate conversations around difficult topics, below are a few actions our PCCs have taken in creating welcoming environments for their clients: 1.Modifying the office space and adding with children -friendly decorations 2.Greeting pediatric clients and fam ilies at the clinic with goody bags, stickers, and books 3.Clearly communicating plans with clients and families ahead of appointments, ensuring that they are prepared and comfortable 4.Writing letters to clients that summarize care plans and next steps in the ir primary language 5.Joining phone calls between clients and external organizations in order to advocate for the clients' needs, provide translation if needed, and support the clients through the conversation III. Language Capacity for this Program: A majority of our PCCs speak multiple languages including Spanish, Cantonese, and Mandarin. IV. FY 21/22 challenges: Data reporting was a challenge during FY21/22 . Given that the PCCs were a new role at the clinics, the clinics experienced delays in impl ementing new referral and data collection workflows. By the end of FY22/22, almost all of the clinics had finalized their workflows and are now able to automatically collect data for quarterly reports. The COVID -19 pandemic also proved to be a challenge in FY21/22. Some health centers expressed challenges in hiring their PCC given that the recruitment phase occurred virtually . Some health centers also experienced staff shortages and/or limited staff capacity, causing greater delays in data reporting and rec ruitment. Alameda Health Consortium provided support during this time through check -ins with clinic supervisors, data teams, and the PCCs. Is anyone better off? V. FY 21/22 Client Impact: Our team has continued to hear about the positive impact the PCCs are making on their clients and families. Below are two brief examples of positive client interactions with two of the PCCs : A 7-year -old patient with a Spanish monolingual family has had an extended unmet need for speech therapy. It has been very challe nging for the mother to navigate and advocate for her son. With the PCC's support, the patient is now receiving regular speech therapy at school. The client's mother is very happy and found the PCC's support to be very helpful. The patient is now on his w ay to more functional communication skills. A PCC worked with patient & four other family members in a 1 -month span. This referral brought access to dental, medical, covid vaccines, as well as navigation support for speech delay & disability insurance for patient, parents, and two older siblings.

All health centers retained their PCCs through the fiscal year. The providers themselves also shared that their PCCs have started to improve the ways in which they provide pediatric care at the clinics. One provider shared, \"Our Pediatric Care Coordinator has been an angel sent to us. Their efforts have been noticed and appreciated by the other staff. I can't describe how much of a huge help they have been. They stepped up to the plate and started running.\" VII. FY 22/23 - 25/26 Projections of Clients to be Served: The PCCs are currently at capacity while taking on increasingly complex cases as they've become more established at the clinics. As a result, we expect caseloads to stay consistent with what we saw near the end of FY21/22. We hope to see increases in the number of referrals for clients that screen positively for ACEs given that more clinics have started to incorporate their PCCs into their ACEs screening workflows. We anticipate to serve 5,502 per fiscal year. VIII.

In addition, many providers are only doing telehealth visits, but more families are reques ting in -person care.

Please Describe Ways that the Program Strives to: a.Reduce Mental Health Stigma: Many clients/families are immigrants dealing with multiple traumas and seek help with managing their parenting with children that may have b een traumatized as well. Therapists provide education on the impacts on children from these experiences and support the caregivers to understand and normalize both their own and the child's emot ional reactions and behaviors. By holding a safe environment in which to explore their experiences the therapists and the Family Partner provide support and meaning to the family's lived experiences, which reduces concerns around mental health stigma. b.Create a Welcoming Environment: The ECMH integrated - Silva Clinic program clinicians and Family Partner all speak Spanish and strive to connect with clients/families both through speaking their primary language and through having a relevant cultural perspective.

FY 21/22 challenges: The Pandemic continued throughout the year having an impact especially with in-person sessions and some challenges with collaboration with the pediatricians at the Silva Clinic. La Familia followed county guidelines around wearing masks and working offsite, and often met with families over on -line telehealth programs. The Silva Pediatric clinic also limited in person appointments and the clinicians were not meeting with clients/families at that location. Due to less in -person encounters, the warm hand -off's for introducing clie nts and families from the medical staff to the therapists did not happen. We still received referrals from the medical clinic, however the amount of referrals dropped off presumable due to the lack of in -person medical appointments with the pediatrician s at the medical clinic. Another challenge was engagement with families due to the manner of meeting young children on screen. Telehealth can work well for old children and families, however less so for younger children. Therapists continued to seek new w ays of engaging a child on a screen for play therapy. And at times caregivers found it difficult to be available for sessions with the child due to burn -out from on -line school when the child no longer wanted to be present in front of a screen. Illness was another barrier to services when many occurrences of clients, caregiver's and therapists being out due to illnesses that caused disruption in services. Is anyone better off? V. FY 21/22 Client Impact: Integrated Health Program: Contractor's Family Partners shall work within Contractor's programs to assist families in accessing needed services, promoting independence and building advocacy skills.

Our Family Partner submitted an example of her work with on e of o ur clients and the family. Example of Family Partner work: A mother of a 5 -year -old client who was very anxious that her child learn and keep up with preschool on zoom during the Pandemic. This mother's expectations for her young child was to sit with f ull attention to learn her ABC's in front of a computer screen for the on -line preschool. Our Family Partner built rapport and supported the mother with her own anxiety around her child's education. The Family Partner shared about child development and wh at was typical for the child's age. The Family Partner helped the mother with resources. Our Family Partner wrote: \"When I started working with Mom she had many questions about child development since the client was an only child and Mom did not have a l ot of experience. Mom shared the problems with her child in her school during the pandemic. I helped Mom with understanding the school system and the different options that exist such as a bilingual system and schools with a year -round calendar because M om grew COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES281 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGup in a small town where there was only one school.

Mom had begun looking for schools for the client for the next school year and she was thinking of enrolling her in a bilingual school. After providing this support, Mom informed me that the client was doing better and Mom was prepari ng the client to start in -person school. As a Family Partner, I shared my work with the therapist regarding the family progress.\" Sharing a clinician's experience with one client/family where the intervention of our services brought a positive change : \"I am a Licensed Clinical Social Worker. I have served several culturally diverse families in the community and provided culturally informed services. One of these families was a n ECMH Integrated - Silva Clinic client. This client was a bilingual 5 -year -old g irl of Mexican descent. The client was initially referred for services due to separation anxiety, excessive crying during preschool drop offs, frequent tantrums around limit setting, changes in routine, and transitions. The child experienced irritability a nd restlessness in the home and with her daycare provider. My work with this client and her mother involved tailoring my services to better serve them in their own language and have used my similar cultural background to connect with this family, while lea rning about differences between our backgrounds. Interventions were implemented in therapy to help strengthen the parent -child relationship including evidence -based practices, such as Brief Strategic Family Therapy techniques and Solution Focused Therapy t echniques. The child made significant improvements in her time in treatment, such as being more flexible with changes that occurred in her daily life, managing her frustration, and decreasing her separation anxiety. The client's case was closed due to posi tive improvements in her behavior and due to mother's ability to feel prepared in managing her daughter's behaviors in the moment. \" VI.FY 21/22 Additional Information: Our program has recently hired a new clinician and is now fully staffed to serve the clients and families referred from Silva Clinic. The Long-term plans for the ECMH integrated - Silva Clinic program include the building of a new medical center where services by the medical providers at TVHC and the mental health providers from La Familia Counseling will be housed under one roof. The plans for this collaboration continue to be viable although there has been a delay in the building of this project. It is hoped that this structure will proceed sometime this year or the next.

Please Describe Ways that the Program Strives to: a.Reduce Mental Health Stigma: Our IBHCC coordinators actively participate in trainings and workshop discussions that address stigma in mental health. These training s and discussions have allowed our IBHCCs, and entire behavioral health ( BH) team to talk openly with patients, BH team members, and other clinic staff about mental health. They have also helped us and deepen our understanding of ways to diminish stigma. b.Create a Welcoming Environment: Integrated Behavioral Health services at LifeLong have allowed our IBHCCs to provide warm handoff s for our patients seeking behavioral health services. WHOs have helped create a friendly environment that makes patients feel more at ease which helps improve their healthcare experience. They also help normalize mental health as part of a patient's overall healthcare, which is both welcoming and helps reduce stigma. III. Language Capacity for this Program: Our IBHCCs are bilingual and fluent in English and Spanish. We also have num erous bilingual therapists who conduct sessions in both English and Spanish , and two therapists in oth er clinics at the organization who see patients in other languages. Language can be an obstacle for connecting our patient to BH services, but our IBHCCs use an interpreter line and assist patient s who need a different language in getting connected to a BH provider who speak s that patient's language . We also offer BH appointments using the interpreter line or if the patient 's insurance allows it, we can request an in -person inter preter. IV. FY 21/22 challenges: Staffing changes at the organization has been one of greatest challenges in this past year. Onboarding and training new BH staff , including both new IB HCCs and new BH providers, has impacted the number of referrals our IBHCCs were able to process .COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES283 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGA sustained high rate of referrals to BH has been another challenge. Since the beginning of the pandemic, there has been an increased and high number of BH referrals . This has impacted many levels -for our IBHCCs, it has impacted being able to outreach patients in a timely manner, getting patients into BH care within the clinic, and getting our patients connected to BH services outside of our organization . Many outside organizations that we refer to have similarly been impacted, and so have not taken our referral . This has made it challenging to refer patients who need it to a higher level of BH care , to long -term therapy , and to agencies that conduct ADHD assessments and provide medication management for ADHD. Is anyone better off? V. FY 21/22 Client Impact: IBHCCs have connected hundreds of patients with therapy , psychiatry , substance use, medical, transportation, and other services. Additionally, we've conducted focus groups and patient feedback surveys to better understand patients' experiences receiving m ental health services at LifeLong . The goals of these were to find out if mental health services have been helpful, whether the mental health services patients have received have been aligned with patients' identities and cultural backgrounds, and what can be done to improve patients' experiences. Patients who participated in the focus groups gave us positive feedback that services have helped them make positive changes in their lives. Patients also shared what ideas and areas of improvement. VI.FY 21/22 Additional Information: Our IBHCCs have worked hard to build relationships with patients, BH team members, medical providers, other staff members, and community agencies. They are constantly on the phone or meeting with patients, connecting patients with all of these other people and resources. They also work with similar positions across the agency, and across Alameda County, to share resources and learn together. VII. FY 22/23 - 25/26 Projections of Clients to be Served: We estimate 1,404 of clients will be served in each fiscal year. VIII. FY 22/23 Programs or Service Changes: We anticipate additional staffing changes and growth of the BH team in FY 22/23. We will be working to implement some of the recommendations we have learned from patient focus groups and feedback surveys, such as mindfully asking patients about their preferences for a BH provider in terms of identity, race, and culture.COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES284 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGOUTREACH / ENGAGEMENT & SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT (OESD) REPORT OESD #: OESD 25 PROVIDER NAME: Federally Qualified Health Centers ( FQHC s)- Native American Health Center PROGRAM NAME: Behavioral Health - Primary Care Integration Project: Care Coordination Program Description: Care Coordinators at Native American Health Center assist members in navigating the medical, behavioral health, and social services systems by helping connect to specialists and community resources. They also help coordinate care amon gst different specialties and primary care as needed. Target Population: Members who are receiving primary care at Native American Health Center who are ages 22 and over. How Much Did We Do? I. FY 21/22: a.Number of Unique Clients Served: 221. ACBH portion of total program budget: $60,828 How Well Did We Do? II. Please Describe Ways that the Program Strives to: a.Reduce Mental Health Stigma: Our care coordinator provides warm handoffs during medical visits for members who may have a mental health diagnosis to discuss service options and provide supports. The care coordinator also provides education around mental health services and helps to address member concerns regarding engagement in mental health care. An example of this is a member that originally was working with our care coordinator regarding housing, but who also had a long history of depression treated via medications only with continued symptoms. The care coordinator offered to connect member to therapy services and provided further information about the ways that therapy may support them. M ember was hesitant and the care coordinator let member know that it was always an option in the future and would continue to suggest engagement in therapy from time to time as appropriate. Eventually, member agreed to connect to therapy and continues to a ttend sessions. b.Create a Welcoming Environment: Our care coordinator greats members when walking around the clinic, introduces themselves and obtains consent when doing warm handoffs and beginning care coordination services, they utilize members' preferre d names and help members connect to appropriate administrators when they feel their needs are not being met within the health care system. III. Language Capacity for this Program: English, Spanish, Utilization of Proprio and/or Language Line Solutions for translation services in other languages. IV. FY 21/22 challenges: The biggest challenge generally h as come when working with specialists who do not always have registration packets in languages other than English or that cannot or will not offer translation services during appointments. Our care coordinator when regularly attend (via telephone and with member consent) specialist appointments with the member to help support with translation.COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES285 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGThe second challenge CC faced in quarter 1 was getting members connected to their specialty appointments at Highland Hospital. CC was faced with the challenge of no appointments being available for patients. At times, appointments will be available 1 month out. As a result, care coordinator encouraged patients to not miss their specialty appointments. The biggest challenge that Neftaley faced in quarter 2 was getting patients connected to NorCal Imaging in Oakland for CT scans and ultrasounds. Over the last three months, it has been difficult to get anyone to pick up the phone at NorCal Imaging. At times, care coordinator was on hold for 3 hours and would not get a response/ anything resolved. Patients reported the same problem with scheduling their own CT scans and ultrasounds. As a result, care coordinator an d referrals team started sending patient's to alternative locations. The biggest challenge that Neftaley faced for quarter 3 was getting transportation for member's specialty appointments. Motive Care has become very unreliable over the last few months an d often times they forget to pick up members for their appointments or they show up one to two hours late. This has been a problem given that some of these members cannot afford the late cancel fees or missed appointment fees that specialist charge members . Members are now having to pay $25 - $100 in fees, which they cannot afford, due to the lack of consistency from Motive Care. Care coordinator has started scheduling member's pick -up time one -hour prior in order for members to be picked up on time and mak e it to their appointments. One of the biggest challenges that Neftaley faced this quarter was getting patients connected to physical therapy. When trying to connect members to Montclair Physical Therapy, care coordinator was unable to receive a response from PT location. After multi ple calls and member's trying to go in -person, care coordinator had a lot of difficulty getting connected to someone at that facility. Care coordinator updated PCPs at NAHC so that they can send their patients elsewhere who are in need of physical therapy. Is anyone better off? V. FY 21/22 Client Impact: CN is a Spanish speaking member Neftaley worked closely with this quarter that was referred to her via warm handoff. CN's primary care physician was concerned with member's health and wanted care coordina tor to assist member and her family with making specialty appointments. Care coordinator was able to establish a connection with member and her family as she was able to communicate with them in Spanish and understand their cultural background. Member's authorized representative/daughter let CC know that her mother needed to see an eye specialist because her vision was getting blurrier. CC was able to schedule ophthalmologist appointment for member and she was able to get checked by a specialist right away. Additionally, Neftaley helped the family fill out IHSS application so that member could get additional support in the home. Care coordinator has been working closely with member's primary care physician and family to ensure that member has all the support she needs to get back to health. If member attends all her specialty appointments she should be able to get her surgery she needs on. JVF is a Spanish Speaking patient Neftaley worked closely with this quarter referred to her via warm handoff. Care coor dinator worked on getting member connected with BH services at NAHC. JVF's therapist and primary care physician were concerned member was not attending his specialty appointments and asked for care coordinator's support. Member let care coordinator know th at his biggest obstacle with making it to his appointments was transportation. Member has HealthPac, which COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES286 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGunfortunately, does not cover transportation. Care coordinator asked member if he knew how to navigate the bus and BART system in Oakland. Member let care coordinator know that he knew how to get around on public transportation with directions. Care coordinator printed member directions for all three of his specialty appointments and sent them to him via mail. Additionally, care coordinator sent member appointment reminders. With all the additional support, member made it to his optometry and ENT appointments. Next month, member has a surgery coming up and care coordinator is working towards making sure member completes all his pre -surgery requirements. JD is a care coordination member Neftaley worked closely with this quarter referred to her via care coordination referral. Care Coordinator has worked closely with member and her primary care physician to get her health back on track. The priority in the members care plan is figuring out what is causing member to have short term memory loss. Member's primary care physician wanted her to get connected to neurology to have a specialist weigh in on the matter. Care coordinator worked diligently to make sure that member was connected to a neurologist. Care coordinator assisted member with new patient paperwork and even taught member how to use Zoom for her telemedicine visit with the neurologist. In order to ensure member remembered to tell the neurologist all of her concerns, Neftaley virtually attended appointment with member via Zoom. Additionally, care coordinator reported back the recommendations and next steps given by the neurologist for patient and primary care physician. Care coordinator continues work ing with member on making sure she makes it to her specialty appointments and keep her primary care physician up to date with all of her appointments. CR is a patient that Neftaley has been working closely with for a few months who was referred for care coordination services via PCP. Care coordinator has worked closely with member and her primary care physician on getting her connected to specialists, like neurology, and working on getting her more accessible transportation due to her limited mobility. The priority for this member was making sure that she was established with Home Health at home so that they could provide her with both Occupational Therapy and Physical Therapy. In addition, care coordinator has worked alongside PCP to get her the proper D ME she needs at home like shower chair, toilet support, and medical bed, in order to help her move around her home when her IHSS worker is not available to help her. The biggest challenge that has risen in this member's case is transportation. Due to member's limited mobility and lack of reliability with Motive Care, it has been difficult for member to get to her specialty appointments. With the support of fellow care coordinator and PCP, care coordinator was able to get member connected to gurney transports, which will be able to help member with getting to her appointments safely. Care coordinator is happy she was able to find a solution for member prior to her departure. VI. FY 21/22 Additional Information: The care coordination program at Native American Health Center consists of several components. We have an Integrative Behavioral Health Care Coordinator whose program is described in the above narratives. We also have three Community Health Workers who are part of the Care Neighborhood program through CHCN. The Care Neighborhood program is part of CalAIM and focuses on adult members who fit into one of three categories: homeless or at i mminent risk of homelessness, are high utilizers of the emergency department or in -patient hospitalizations, or have severe mental illness or substance abuse concerns. We also have the Pediatric Care Coordinator who works with youth and families, his focu s is on ages 0 -21.

The culturally responsive curriculum was developed to address the topics of: 1. Stigma around mental health problems in the African American community that can lead to delays in or termination of treatment; 2. Medication issues such as over/under prescribing, incorrect dosage and side effects; 3. Historical trauma of African Americans; 4. Health disparities impacting African American com munities; 5.

Please Describe Ways that the Program Strives to: a.Reduce Mental Health Stigma: Throughout this year's training program , a number of the speaker s focused on issues that particularly create stigma in specific African American communities. The trainers presented clear information which outlined the intersectionality of diversity and trauma and how those two issues are linked to create stigma in Afri can American communities. In order to highlight the issues of stigma speakers focused on the importance of grassroots -based initiatives for holistic healing and health within the African American community. There was also specific training related to crea ting a safe space for African American LGBTQ Youth who often are excluded and disenfranchised both in the community and in their school settings. This training offered specific ways that safer spaces can be created in both schools and the community for thi s very vulnerable youth group.COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES293 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGImplicit Bias is now incorporated into all of our training curriculum. All continuing education course content must now contain a curriculum that also includes specified instruction in the understanding of implicit bias in t reatment. This requirement is based on California assembly bill 241. Understanding implicit bias helps providers to develop more insight when serving more diverse populations. b.Create a Welcoming Environment: The trainers definitely understood the importa nce of creating a welcoming environment for African Americans who receive services in the behavioral health system. One of the trainings pacifically targeted the issue of women's mental health and creating a welcoming and safe environment for African American women by talking with them and not assuming as a provider that you know their issues. The trainer stressed the importance of listening to clients with understanding and compassion. Another speaker dealt with the utilization of culturally sensitive diagnostic assessment and treatment approaches when working with the African -American community and utilizing these approaches to create a more welcoming environment. We offer the best board certified, licensed and seasoned trainers. They know how to enga ge their audience and provide up to date information for practitioners. In fiscal year FY 21/22, we offered trainings that were specifically requested by participants who attended our trainings in FY20 /21. So , we used the feedback and training topic requests that participants listed on their Survey Monkey questionnaires to come up with this fiscal years' curriculum . This made this years' trainings an even more valuable experience. We also added made our last two trainings of FY21/22 \"hybrid\" for tho se who learn better in - person. COVID tests were administered and proof of vaccine and/or boosters were also required. In addition, we secured additional space to comply social distancing rules to make it welcoming and to promote safety. III. Language Capa city for this Program: N/A IV. FY 21/22 challenges: The primary challenges we encountered in the 21/22 fiscal year was our moving from virtual to live presentations. We utilized a hybrid program for two of our trainings, which allowed for participants to join the training virtually or in person. We offered these two trainings near the end of the fiscal year. We found that there was still some reluctance on the part of people to attend and participate in live training s. We will continue to review this issu e in order to gain a better understanding of what has created this reluctance in terms of people returning to live presentations. As we move into year -four of our TA contract, we continue to diligently work to adequately respond to the growing needs within our community during the pandemic. Ongoing individualized technical assistance and training around this subject matter critical for the CBOs and FQHCs who are requesting our services. This has become particularly important with the number of changes that have occurred in Alameda County related to the changes with Cal AIM and the grand jury investigation that has targeted a number of Alameda County behavioral health programs. As shared i n FY20/21, our AATA program believes that it is not only fiscally responsible to allocate additional funding for innovation of our contract but it also allows our program the ability to connect and train even more providers in Alameda County. This increase will allow Pathways AATA Program to have a positive impact on community understanding and needs for African American mental health services.

V.FY 21/22 Client Impact: While the program does not specifically see clients there is an impact from some of the training programs that we believe will improve the use of psychiatric medication in the African American population and in the behavioral health system. The training titled Cultural Psychiatry: Psychiatric Medication Use in the African American Population offered specific tools and information regarding medication use with African American clients. VI. FY 21/22 Additional Information: We would like to expand our trainings by offering training podcasts and as well as more community listening sessions for a larger population in the community. We have noted there are a number of mental health issues that are impacting CBOs, federally qualified health centers, schools, hospitals and correctional facilities. There is an increasing need for the Technical Assistance Podcast and Community Listening Sessions given some of the issues currently existing in the Alameda County community. The issue of homelessness and youth suicides are only two of the issues that we would like to have an opportunity to make an impact on through our Technical Assistance Training program. In order to begin training and implementing programs in these other systems, we have now developed the \"No Wrong Door Policy,\" in which we will require additional funding in order to offer the Training and Technical Assistance program to these additional systems. VII. FY 22/23 Projections of Clients to be Served: We are projecting a minimum of 200 to 300 unduplicated participants for each fiscal year (FY 22/23 - 25/26) with an average of 35 to 45 in attendance at any given training. Participant attendance next year will depend on topics that we offer and what the community needs are during each contract year. Meanwhile, we plan to offer a minimum of quarterly individualized Technical Assistance Trainings. VIII. FY 22/23 Programs or Service Changes: This new fiscal year we intend to begin to increase our number of webinars, utilization of social media specifically with podcasts, community listening sessions, and the utilization of LinkedIn to connect us to additional providers and the broader Alameda County community. Alameda County providers, CBOs and FQHCs will continue to be a core focus for the AATA team.COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES295 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGOUTREACH / ENGAGEMENT & SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT (OESD) REPORT AfiyaCare provides mental health services, case management/brokerage and crisis intervention.

Connect clients immediat ely to resources to meet urgent and essential needs; 3. Connect clients with short - and long -term support services; and 4. Reduce hospitalization, incarceration, and other emergency services. Target Population: AfiyaCare serves adults who identify as Afric an American, ages 18 -59, with a serious mental illness (SMI), that have a history of involvement with the criminal justice system, which may include individuals previously engaged in mental health crisis, residential, and/or outpatient services. How Much D id We Do? I. FY 21/22: a.Number of Unique Clients Served: 58. Cost per client: $6,663 How Well Did We Do? II. Please Describe Ways that the Program Strives to: a.Reduce Mental Health Stigma: AfiyaCare clinicians and Navigators identify as African American and are trained in culturally competent and trauma informed approaches. This contributes to a program that is culturally responsive, congruent, and has a positive impact on its members as a whole. Furthermore, program staff strive to reduce mental health stigma by normalizing the process of seeking mental health resources through education. This includes educating members on how their holistic wellness is interconnected between health, mind, body, and spirit. This approach is particularly helpful for members coming from a cultural perspective that views mental health and seeking out mental health treatment as something that is done when you are 'crazy,' or when something is 'wrong' with you. As members understand the symptoms they are experiencing can be decreased, managed, or eradicated, there is increased openness to receiving support. b.Create a Welcoming Environment: During a member's initial session, AfiyaCare clinicians take a learning role and all ow each member to educate them on the experiences that brought them to therapy. Staff practice non -judgmental, non -verbal communication; making sure each member feels heard. We acknowledge that each member is the expert of their own life. People make decis ions based on the information they have available to them at the time -this pedagogy is welcoming and lays the groundwork for a joint exploration of new actions that can achieve wellness. We recognize that each client will share their story if they feel acc epted, heard, and in an environment where they are free from judgment.COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES296 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGIII. Language Capacity for this Program: All participants and staff spoke English. If a member who spoke a different language was referred to the program, we informed the referral source and connected them with a program that had the appropriate language capacity. If our staff encountered a member who spoke a language other than English, they would have utilized the Language Line Solution services offered through Alameda County Beha vioral Health. IV. FY 21/22 Challenges: program experienced staffing changes -we lost one clinician and as a result, the remaining clinician worked to balance additional members in her schedule as well as re -author treatment plans for transferred members. AfiyaCare clinicians are already challenged with the intensity of treating moderate to severe diagnoses and symptoms of our AfiyaCare members, therefore, having only one clinician was difficult. T his also contributed to stra in surrounding the timely completion of documentation. Furthermore, while management made extensive efforts to hire additional clinical staff throughout the year, the number of applicants was limited. Barriers to hiring continue to include a low number of applicants who apply, lack of appropriate qualifications, and candidates requesting entirely remote schedules as Roots remains hybrid. While the development of new documentation and billing workflows have been successful, adapting to new protocols in Roo ts' electronic health record system, AdvancedMD, required training and adjustment. In addition, extensive staff time went towards late billing entries. Lastly, maintaining contact with AfiyaCare members often poses a challenge as many individuals no longe r respond to communication attempts or lack additional contact information. This contributes to a significant number of members who become inactive in the program, as it is difficult to keep members engaged for a consistent amount of time. Is Anyone Better Off? V. FY 21/22 Client Impact: Our AfiyaCare Clinician and Health Navigators have worked to provide resources including but not limited to; housing, food assistance, primary care, behavioral health care, clothes for interviews, benefits (CalFresh, Medi -Cal, & General Assistance), hotel vouchers, transportation, employment assistance, ID vouchers, hygiene kits, and diapers. Staff members have continued to work with members in -person and via telehealth. Both clinicians and Health Navigators remain on site every day to aid in connecting walk -in clients to the AfiyaCare program. In addition, our program exceeded the projected number of members served for FY 21/22. Of members who were part of the program, 74% were retained for at least two months or tran sitioned to a more appropriate program. Impact measures for AfiyaCare were either met or surpassed; as 89% of members had a reduction in admissions to jail and 100% of members had a reduction in admissions to John George Psychiatric Pavilion, Psychiatric E mergency Services/Crisis Stabilization Unit and inpatient. AfiyaCare Clinician Monika Davis -Scott has provided the following Member Highlights: Mr. N's Story : Mr. N joined the AfiyaCare program with PTSD symptoms ranging from moderate to severe. The cl ient's sleep was impaired due to intrusive thoughts, his hypervigilance, and never feeling safe in his environment. Mr. N was unhoused when he came to us, residing in his car. He began working with his navigator Mr. Perrie Anderson, who assisted him with h ousing placement and addressing barriers to employment. COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES297 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGOne of the most significant barriers for Mr. N was his inability to regulate his emotions. He had a long history of trauma, and when it looked like things were not going to work out for him, he could quickly become agitated and fall back on his fatalistic viewpoint about life. The combined services of therapy and Health Navigation were instrumental in the successes Mr. N achieved. He learned tools to regulate his heightened emotional state in thera py. The most important work came in between sessions when Mr. N would meet with Perrie. The road to permanent housing can produce many frustrating moments; Perrie was able to model self -soothing exercises with Mr. N in order to reduce anxiety. In therapy s essions, Mr. N also responded well to visualization and manifestation exercises. Mr. N is now housed in his own apartment. He has a strong work ethic and is currently working two jobs, both at Tesla and at a warehouse stocking merchandise. Mr. N expressed that he enjoys working two jobs because it makes him feel good not relying on one source of income. Mr. N's speech and presentation is more relaxed than when he first came to the Afiya Care program. He continues monthly therapy sessions by phone for a che ck-in. Ms. G's Story : Ms. G came to the Afiya Care program in May 2021. She is originally from Memphis, Tennessee, and had moved to Oakland with her partner a few years back in search of better employment opportunities. Ms. G's relationship with her partner had become unhealthy and she made the decision to leave the relationship; resulting in her becoming unhoused and sleeping in her car. Ms. G was wo rking at the time and still trying to maintain her employment. In addition, she was about to begin a new position at Tesla, which she was very excited about. In session, Ms. G stated that with her new position at Tesla, she would have the ability to move i nto an apartment and afford to pay rent. Ms. G had a historical diagnosis for bipolar depression, but she also was dealing with the aftermath of the trauma she sustained with her ex -partner. Ms. G's symptoms included intrusive thoughts, impaired sleep, an d anxious and depressive feelings. She described periods of time when she could function and manage on little sleep, while at other times, her depressive feelings made it difficult to get activated for the day. Ms. G responded well to the somatic tools of deep breathing and grounding exercises, as well as the Cognitive Behavioral interventions of examining thoughts, testing them for validity, and removing cognitive distortions. Ms. G began working with Navigator Kim Stovall to develop a plan to address bar riers related to regaining housing and maintaining stable employment. She was very open to the therapeutic process and worked collaboratively with Kim. In between sessions, Ms. Stovall provided active and supportive listening and offered resources such as personal care items, food cards, and interim hotel stays to get Ms. G through the waiting process. Kim was instrumental in working with Ms. G to construct an action plan based on her personal goals. After Ms. G's close work with Kim, she was finally able to move into her apartment. While she graduated from the AfiyaCare program, she remains a member at Roots. Ms. G is now a member of our Complex Care program due to her chronic health conditions and will continue to receive behavioral health services with us. VI.

Their goal is to reduce the impact of untreated mental illness in these adults and provide support or their families. The intentio n of referral and linkage is to help prevent an increase in symptoms, added impairments, or need for more hospitalizations. The teams schedule appointments with participants, family members, friends, and other providers, as well as assist with connections to community resources. Target Population: IHOT serves adults (ages 18 -59) with severe mental illness, who are not currently engaged in mental health treatment or have become disengaged, who are considered resistant or reluctant to participating voluntaril y and present with a variety of barriers that prevent them from connecting to mental health services and other community resources.

Please Describe Ways that the Program Strives to: a.Reduce Mental Health Stigma: The Abode Services IHOT team works to reduce the stigma of mental health with families and our participants. We do this by engaging with people on their terms. That means that we meet them where they are most comfortable and build rapport by focusing on what they identify as an important need. Our team avoids using stigmatizing language or mental health jargon that may turn off participants or families. As much as we can, we focus on participant s' strengths and wellness and assist them to address barriers to mental health and other services. Our team also works intensively with families, providing education and support helping them to better understand t heir loved ones who are dealing with mental health issues. Finally, our team advocates for the best treatment options available for our participants and provide support to deal with barriers. b.Create a Welcoming Environment: Our team engages with partic ipants using a conversational style best suited to their individual needs.

III. Language Capacity for this Program: We have just hired a staff person who speaks Farsi. We have found that most of our participants speak English. When we have needed to utilize a translation service, we use the ACBH Language Line. IV. FY 21/22 challenges: Challenges this year have been related to the lack of availability of temporary housing (shelters serving participants with MH issues, waiting lists fo r CRT's). For participants who are homeless, it has been difficult at times to engage them on the streets as well as locating participants. In addition, our system of care focuses on those with long Mental Health and incarceration histories when referrin g to intensive MH services. This is sometimes a challenge because IHOT referrals include people who have never been in a hospital or incarcerated. However, they are suffering from some serious MH challenges and do not respond well to outpatient services without ongoing case management support. This has been challenging for our IHOT team to determine when to discharge our participants from the program. Is anyone better off? V.FY 21/22 Client Impact: We have been successful in connecting many participants to MH services and to other services including Social Security, medical and Social Services. We have provided much needed support and education to their families helping them to remain as intact families in many cases. VI. FY 21/22 Additional Information: N/A VII.

Please Describe Ways that the Program Strives to: a.Reduce Mental Health Stigma: IHOT has helped reduced mental health stigma in the lives of consumers and family members of consumers by Peer Support Specialists and a Fa mily Coach providing IHOT services, IHOT providing culturally -informed psychoeducation to family members, and by La Familia hosting a Support Group for Family Members and Caregivers of IHOT consumers.

The Family Coach and Peer Support Specialists coach consumers and their family members in a way that imparts their lived experiences as way to encourage consumers and family members to maintain ho pe that change is possible. IHOT also helps to reduce mental health stigma by educating families on the causes of mental illness and how mental illness is not the fault of the parents and family. IHOT teaches family members that mental illness is rooted in various factors, such as genetics and adverse life events, that are not necessarily in the control of the families. This helps families feel that the mental illness of their loved one is not a fault of their own. IHOT also normalizes for families the vari ous feelings they experience in relationship to theirCOMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES304 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGloved one suffering from mental illness, such as helplessness, hopelessness, anger and sadness and how such feelings are commonly experienced by family members in similar circumstances. IHOT has also he lped to reduce mental health stigma by providing a Support Group for Families and Caregivers of Consumers . The purpose of the IHOT Family and Caregiver Support Group is to provide a space where family members and caregivers of La Familia IHOT consumers can reduce a sense of isolation through sharing their personal experiences. Families and caregivers also receive education about mental illness and how to navigate a complicated mental health care system. b.Create a Welcoming Environment: La Familia IHOT create s a welcoming environment for consu mers and their family members by informing the consumer and family members that IHOT is committed to listening to all sides of the story in regards to the family, not just one family member or the consumer . La Familia IHOT also provides IHOT services in Spanish through Spanish - language IHOT staff as well as IHOT staff utilizing the Alameda County Language line for other languages besides English. The IHOT team prides itself in building rapport and connection with client s who are commonly perceived as \"difficult\" by other individuals in the community. We meet with clients on a regular basis even if they present as ambivalent about IHOT services and listen to their stories of frustration of the manner they have been treate d unfairly in the past. IHOT allows them to fully express themselves in a way they have not experienced for a long time. We often defer to whatever goals consumers stipulate are of immediate priority as differentiated between the goals family members or ot her community members may perceived as the goals of consumers. In this way, we meet clients where they are at and recognize a basic level of their humanity. IHOT also meets with consumers on a consistent basis at whatever location they would prefer, such a s in community parks, alleys, homeless encampments, their home, homeless shelters, etcetera. IHOT also has the ability to support clients in purchasing basic items such as a meal, a sleeping bag, coffee, and a change of clothes. It is through these methods IHOT seemingly creates a parallel experience of family and new social support system which may have been absent in their lives for a significant period of time which includes a mixture of socio -emotional support and support with basic necessities . III. L anguage Capacity for this Program: La Familia IHOT possessed two (2) fluent Spanish -speaking staff, Lead Case Manager and Peer Support Specialist, who provided IHOT services. IHOT also possessed a one (1) staff, a Peer Support Specialist, who was proficien t, but not fluent in providing IHOT services. These three staff have transitioned out of their role in IHOT. The Program Supervisor understands and speaks basic rudimentary Spanish to provide IHOT services to Spanish -speaking consumer population and their families. However, the Program Supervisor is utilizing the Alameda County Language Line to provide Spanish -English translation for IHOT services when necessary. IHOT has also utilized this past fiscal year the Alameda Language Line to provide IHOT services to some families of Asian descent who do not speak English. The utilization of the Alameda County Language Line to provide IHOT services to families of diverse languages has been effective in contributing to the success of the IHOT consumers achieving the ir goals of well -being and mental health.

The consumer passed away due to suspected medical complicates related to late -stage cirrhosis of the liver. An Unusual Occurrence & Death Reporting Form was completed for their consumer . Elderlly & Medically -Complex Consumer s: IHOT worked with two consumer s in particular who were elderly and experienced comp lex medical needs. Unfortunatley , these consumer s did not qualify for Operation Saferground as they did not live in the qualifying area. These consumer s continued to rem ain homeless during the duration IHOT services. One consumer in particular has been continually refused residene in boarding care homes due to difficulty with activities of daily living. The other consumer in particular was one of the consumer s who passed away due to complex medical complications stated above. Although shelter is a resource that is very difficult to access for any person, IHOT experience extended difficulty working these these elderly consumer s who continued to remain homeless during IHOT services.

On April 21st, La Familia hosted a guest speaker, Lead Family Advocate from Family Education & Resource Center, to speak to families about the services offered by FERC . On May 19th, La Familia hosted a guest speaker from Patients' Rights Advocates to speak about the patients rights and grievance process. Increase of Referrals from Homeless Shelters: La Familia IHOT experienced a steady increase and maintenence of referrals from a particular homeless shelter in Castro Valley, First Presbyterian Church of Alameda County. These referrals requested assistance with residents at the shelter who shelter staf f experienced difficulty engag ing and who need more assistance than could be provided by shelter staff. IHOT supported shelter staff to assist consumer s with document readiness and provide additional emotional support. IHOT Referral Linkage: La Familia IHOT has successfully connected many IHOT consumer s to specialty mental heal th services within Alameda County based on their level of care, such as Level 1, Level 3, and Full Service Partnerships (FSP). IHOT has also connected a significant percentage of IHOT consumer s to Assisted Outpatient Treatment (AOT). Many of these consumer s would not be aware of how to access these mental health services without the support of IHOT. IHOT also supported consumers to successfully apply for General Assistance and CalFresh/food stamps. IHOT Incentives: IHOT provided two -hundred and twenty -two (222) gift cards to total number of forty - seven (47) consumers . Some consumers were provided gift cards more than once.

FY 21/22: a.Number of Unique Clients Served: 54. Cost per client: $9,215 How Well Did We Do? II. Please Describe Ways that the Program Strives to: a.Reduce Mental Health Stigma: The program works to meet clients where they are with the support of transition facilitators and family advocates who have personal lived experience with mental health, substance use, and / or previous homelessness.

These methods include games, art, food, and activi ties such as going to libraries or small walks. The team always seeks to connect with the individuals they are working with in a respectful manner and use the goals that the individual is interested in to help them see the benefit of connecting and linking with other treatment providers. The team expresses interest in the topics and goals that the individual has stated are important to them. The team will also work with other people that the individual has identified as important supports, once permission i s given to include them and create specific supports for family who may be overwhelmed. III. Language Capacity for this Program: Currently IHOT has language capacity for Spanish and Punjabi . Forty clients were served primarily in English. Fourteen client s received services in Spanish . IV. FY 21/22 challenges: The biggest challenge impacting the program at this time is the global pandemic we continue to face. It makes connecting with clients in hospitals extremely difficult and it is harder for the team t o utilize the resources that they have previously utilized to find and connect with clients. Client anxieties and occasional mental health related paranoia impact the client's desire to connect or increase their individual stress overall which causes more irritability, difficulty managing symptoms and isolation. We have attempted to utilize more collateral supports to connect and link clients. However, not all individuals have a trusted family support system that can be of help. Another challenge in the pa st year has been coordinating with referring parties. Over the past year, number of referrals made by parents has increased. When IHOT is unable to connect directly with the client, IHOT relies on the support of the referring party to support with coordina tion. Over the past year, there has been an increase in referring party not supporting the coordination of care with client, causing a delay in services. Is anyone better off? V. FY 21/22 Client Impact: 15 clients who were not linked anywhere ; 33 clients linked back to previous provider or IHOT bridged to a new provider ; 6 are still in the process of engaging with IHOT and are not linked to a program yet . The IHOT program offers a once monthly family support group using tele -health modalities. This group is co-facilitated by a clinician and a family advocate. At the initial IHOT assessment of a youth, family resources are also assessed and if appropriate families are invited to participate in a monthly family support group. Through participation in this g roup, a community of supportive families has developed. Family members can rely on each other and the shared lived experiences for support as their youth is being offered services. Participating family members also receive psycho -education from facilitato rs and other participants normalizing and supporting them in their experiences. This not only supports the family but also allows for the youth to be better served by the IHOT team. Over the past year, every parent who has participated in family group is or was a foster parent who moved forward with adoption. This has allowed our group participants to build rapport on having a similar story of becoming a parent. Our group participants have been able to support each other while navigating adult children who are curious of their biological parents.

Individuals receive assessment, person -centered treatment planning, and ongoing counseling, clinical care coordination, linkage, and peer support. As individuals are awarded SSI benefits, they become stable and effective at managing their own lives. Individuals are then linked with ongoing natural and community -based supports for ongoing support. The program has a multidisciplinary staffing model that includes 50% clinical ca re coordinators and 50% peer counselors - people with their own lived experiences that can walk alongside someone to navigate the challenges of the system. Target Population: SAGE serves adults (ages 18 -59) and older adults (60+) who have a qualifying behav ioral health diagnosis and are in the process of obtaining SSI benefits through local legal advocacy firms, Homeless Advocacy Center (HAC) and Bay Area Legal Aid (BALA). All participants live in extreme poverty, at or are under 10% Area Median Income (AMI) . Many individuals are exiting jails or hospitals. The majority of individuals are homeless. How Much Did We Do?

Please Describe Ways that the Program Strives to: a.Reduce Mental Health Stigma: When working with our partner's we like to use the ideology of empowering them rather than pathologizing their mental health . Empowerment of the partners is intended to help them adopt self -determination and autonomy, and gain self -sufficien cy. Empowerment process means overcoming a state of powerlessness and gaining control of one's life. We start by exploring defined basic needs (whether that be housing, connecting to medical services, mental health services) and develop goals that focuses on achieving those goals. We understand that everyone has a story and we are here to hear their story, the challenges of their past and present , and pointing out their resilienc y to increase their empowerment and their ability to improve their lives with the support of BACS Sage team . We see every partner has a voice and choice and they are the decision makers of their lives and by allowing a person to make their own decisions inc reases empowerment of their lives. In order to make the best decision for themselves, we work on providing them with a sufficient amount of information and resources for them to make the best decision for themselves and be a support provider with their bes t interest.COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES316 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGb.Create a Welcoming Environment: In order to provide a welcoming environment, we approach each individual with non- judgement and see every individual has strengths and has a voice and choice in their treatment. We understand that everyone has di fferent needs and goals so we approach the situation in an individual bases and meet them where they are at in their lives. III. Language Capacity for this Program: We have staff that speak English and Spanish. We have access to language line to accommod ate all l anguage needs for our partners. IV. FY 21/22 challenges: We continue recovery from the fluxuating challenges of Covid pandemic; however, we still are community based and we continuet to engage with the partners in the community. Staff Retiton: There has been a large turnover in staff which can hinder the communication and engagement with the partner to a new provider. Partners have expressed that meeting someone new can impact their mental health by having to develop trust with a new provider and experiencing the loss of a relationship of the previous provider. The Sage team is also working on increasing their capacity of 400 census and has been working with HAC/BALA to obtain referrals and outreaching t o referrals in a timely manner. Is anyone better off? V.FY 21/22 Client Impact: We are an agency that does \"Whatever it takes\" and we continue to provide services and meet partner's where they are at and strive to provide them with a whole person care which means that we support every individual with their unique needs. We continue to have a lot of successes with our partners whether it be they obtain their SSI benefits and we graduate them from our program, get permanent housing, or even reconnect them to natural supports which impacts their mental health and connectedness to family/friends. One success story comes to mind is a partner who has been in the program since 7/2020, she experiences a signficant history of Bipolar and PTSD. She has been homeless since starting the program, was on Behavioral Health Court and had no engagement with her children and grandchildren. Throughout the time she was working with BACS, she has been able to connect to medical and therapy resources, graduated from Behavioral health Court, is currently at a safe haven transitional housing and working with BACS to look at apartments since obtaining a permanent housing voucher as of this month and she has been engaging with her children/grandchildren and they have come to visit her at the safe haven placement. She recently told provider that she can't wait for her to have an apartment where her grandchildren can come over and play in her living room. These are the stories and so many other stories that show how the partners and BACS work together to improve and empower their lives by doing \"whatever it takes\". VI.

These services assist adults with SMI to decrease or even diminish mental health symptoms in order to integrate into a community, successfully. Another important purp ose of the Service Team program is to avoid and eliminate repeated patterns of psychiatric hospitalizations for our client adults. The service design includes anywhere from weekly to monthly contacts of direct service. Alameda County Behavioral Health usin g Medi -Cal and Medicare funds currently funds the program. Hospitalizations and incarcerations are a meaningful problem in our area, which occur annually at an increased rate. Supporting our adult clients to understand their mental health symptoms, identif y triggers, and manage those symptoms is an essential process of our program. Poor mental health negatively affects an individual's whole -person health, life expectancy, and their ability to envision as well as create their best lives through the Social Determinants of Health.

Please Describe Ways that the Program Strives to: a.Reduce Mental Health Stigma : Care Coordinators in the BACS Intensive Case Management Service Team (ICM) Program have profound influence on care and attitudes towards care throughout the entire mental health ecosystem in Alameda County, where stigma still exists even within providers and community partners who serve our mutual population. Our staff are trained to hold a \"whatever it takes\" stance while brokering care with all providers to overcome not only stigma from mental health diagnoses, but also negative history from our participants' \"rap sheet\" whe re many are well -known around the county and often refused services or housing due to their troubled past. We have found that the best way to overcome stigma and \"blackballing\" towards our participants is to approach providers and partners will a carefull y thought out plan of action and rich discussion of the human aspects of the participant's current situation in a way that paints a picture of how significant change and growth is still , and always possible for our partners. b.Create a Welcoming Environmen t: 1.We treat our partners as human beings, not as a case # or diagnosis 2.The plan is centered around the partner and what is most important to themCOMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES318 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG3.We do not treat our partners as though their future will repeat the past, we hold unconditional positive regar d, hope and optimism. III. Language Capacity for this Program: English, Spanish, Nigerian Pidgin, African English . IV. FY 21/22 challenges: Over the past year, ICM has been challenged by a decline in labor force in the mental health field, as well as a reduction in basic resources for emergency and permanent housing, food, clothing and substance use treatment. Staff turnover in FY 21 -22 was at least 75%, with mode rate signs of this problem continuing to be a challenge for FY 22 -23. Important emergency housing resources such as Keep Oakland House and Prop 41 funding were exhausted in FY 21 -22 and have not yet been replenished for FY 22 -23 with no anticipated timefr ame. Demand for substance use treatment programs has increased significantly, with longer wait -times for program entry. The same can be said for emergency and transitional housing, which leads to increased frequency of decompensation and hospitalization for many participants. Enrollment to higher level programs such as FSP is also impacted due to low labor force, so low -level programs like ICM are holding on to acute cases longer. ICM participants would benefit from at least $50,000 (per 150 census) in flexible program funding to help compensate for loss or resources and longer wait -times for resources to come available, and would help prevent participants from having to escalate to a higher level of care. Is anyone better off? V.FY 21/22 Client Impact: In the past year, an estimated 30 participants graduated successfully from the program by meeting treatment goals w/ improved functioning that necessitated a lower level of care. Countless episodes of crisis response and prevention mitigated client escalation to a higher level of care such as FSP or long-term impatient care. Clients are routinely reconnected with long-lost family, natural supports, employers and educators that help establish growth and stability ensuring that participants are far less likely to decompensate and require a higher level of care. ICM has a core of low-turnover participants who have formed supportive, reliable and consistent relationships with our staff and have stabilized as a result. VI. FY 21/22 Additional Information: This year, ICM enjoyed philanthropic support by recieving significant grant funding from a generous donor who believes in and shares our mission. This money has been used to support creative solutions and opportunities for our partners. VII. FY 22/23 Projections of Clients to be Served: ICM is seeking to open approximately 50-60 new participants for the fiscal year 22/23 -25/26. VIII. FY 22/23 Programs or Service Changes: ICM has seen approx. 50% staff turnover in the past year, with a new manager starting in June 2022. The program is currently fully staffed and has a strong outlook for stability w/ low turnover in the new fiscal year. The program aims to resume a traditional structure for division of labor with clinical staff taking lead on case planning and ensuring clinical services are available to all participants while coordinating with adjunct staff to provide a critical rehabilitation role to support daily functioning.COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES319 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGOUTREACH / ENGAGEMENT & SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT (OESD) REPORT OESD #: OESD 29 PROVIDER NAME: Felton Institute PROGRAM NAME: Older Adult Service Team Program Description: The Older Adult Service Team supports client recovery through a holistic and strength -based approach that considers the overall bio -psycho -social needs of older adult clients. Over 12% of the consumers are 60 years or older. With a significant number of older adults needing this level or service, creating a team to focus on the uni que needs of the older adult population was a priority. Service Teams are multi -disciplinary and coordinate community -based services to provide individually customized mental health care for people experiencing frequent setbacks or persistent challenges th eir recovery. The overarching goal is for clients to attain a level of autonomy within the community of their choosing. Target Population: The Older Adult Service Team serves older adults (age 60+) who have moderate to severe mental illness impairments res ulting in at least one significant impairment in an important area of life functioning. All clients must meet specialty mental health criteria with impairments in the moderate to severe range. How Much Did We Do? I. FY 21/22: a.Number of Unique Clients Served: 78 Cost per client: $14,082 How Well Did We Do? II. Please Describe Ways that the Program Strives to: a.Reduce Mental Health Stigma: Reducing the stigma around mental health issues is an ongoing challenge that OAST, and Felton as an organization, take very seriously. We mak e an effort to talk openly about this subject in an effort to normalize this and frequently talk to clients about how a psychiatric diagnosis is no different than another medical diagnosis (e.g. you take medication to control your diabetes, taking medicati on to control your Bipolar I Disorder is similar). We are cognizant of the language we use with clients, family members, and other community members and try to educate people whenever possible about why it is important to talk about mental health and use n on-judgmental language. b.Create a Welcoming Environment: Although clients have come into the office much less during the pandemic, Felton has worked hard to make our Alameda office a welcoming place. Front desk staff strive to be helpful and friendly to cli ents coming in, and all Felton staff present a welcoming attitude. The office is visually welcoming, with open areas with seating, plants, artwork, and signage that clearly welcomes people from various demographics , as well as \"all gender\" restrooms .

Recruiting and hiring staff, particularly clinicians, with additional language capacity is a priority. IV. FY 21/22 challenges: The main challenge for the team during FY 21/22 was the pandemic and it s myriad related obstacles. When Covid surged, we had to adjust accordingly, and since the population OAST serves is at increased risk, we had to be very careful in this regard. Ongoing outbreaks in residential facilities made it difficult to see clients f ace-to-face as often as we would have liked, and in many cases caused delays to supporting clients with their case management needs. The fact that this population is less fluent with technology (no client on the caseload has a computer, most do not have cell phones, it is difficult to have a private appointment on a landline in a congregate living facility, etc.) meant that telehealth was often not an option for our clients. The pandemic's impact on the team in terms of staff being out due to their or a family member's illness was also a challenge. The difficulty of doing this work was certainly compounded by the pandemic, which led to staff attrition and increased difficulty with recruiting new staff. Is anyone better off? V. FY 21/22 Client Impact: The contract requires that OAST clients receive a face -to-face meeting within 7 days of discharge from a psychiatric hospitalization or crisis residential facility at least 65% of the time. Even in light of the aforementioned challenges, we were able to surpass this goal, seeing clients in this situation 72% of the time. This likely contributed to the continued stability of clients post -release, as well as strengthening the therape utic rapport. Connection to a primary care medical provider is particularly important for older adults, given the increased medical needs and the complex interactions between psychiatric, cognitive, and medical issues. The contract requires that OAST support at least 75% of our clients to see their PCP at least once during the fiscal year. In FY21/22, 78% of OAST clients saw their PCP and most had multiple appointments with their PCP. Many clients who had not seen a PCP in a long time were connected to primary care. Additionally, several clients who had been precariously housed were supported to move into safer, more supportive, and more stable environments. A number of clients who had previously resisted taking psychiatric medication have successfully started medication regimens and reported symptom reduction. Several clients who had been disengaged from services were re -engaged in treatment during FY 21/22. There are many individual stories of success among the OAST clients, one of which is described below. Case Study (Pseudonym used below and identifying information altered) Sheldon Humphreys is a 76 y.o. Black male who came to the Older Adult Services Team (OAST) on January of 2019 due to a long history of mental health issues. Originally from the s outh, he moved to Oakland at the age of 5. His parents died when he was a teenager and his symptoms began shortly thereafter, leading to a lengthy hospitalizations. Mr. Humphreys also has a long history of homelessness and had difficulty adjusting to livin g indoors. He has had multiple hospitalizations and crisis contacts within this system of care. Mr. Humphreys has many strengths, including his resilience, optimism, and resourcefulness. He has a strong Baptist faith and maintains a close relationship with his sister, Betty. Mr. Humphreys has a primary diagnosis of Bipolar I Disorder, Severe, Most Recent Episode Depressed, w/ Psychotic Features, as well as a history of Cocaine Use Disorder and Alcohol Use Disorder. His symptoms include depressed mood, agit ation, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness, internal preoccupation, auditory hallucinations, and isolative behavior. These symptoms were not well -controlled, due to his COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES321 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGsubstance use and difficulty adhering to his medication regimen. His alcohol use contrib uted to violent behavior that led to multiple arrests. He also struggled to attend to ADLs, including personal hygiene, a healthy diet, money management, and keeping scheduled medical appointments. In mid -2021, Mr. Humphreys was drinking daily and returnin g to his residence (an independent living home) intoxicated, where he disturbed other residents and caused significant property damage. This behavior ultimately led to his eviction and a return to homelessness. OAST team members have worked with Mr. Humphreys over the past 3 years to provide case management, individual rehabilitation, and medication management. He was connected to primary care through LifeLong Medical and to Alameda County Subpayee for money mana gement services, and was supported to move into a very nice Licensed Board & Care home. Mr. Humphreys has maintained this placement for nearly a year and says that he is very happy living there. He has now been sober for 10 months. He has been able to atte nd to ADLS with limited support, including following through with medical appointments and maintaining medication compliance. He reports a significant reduction in his mental health symptoms, and the property manager describes him as a \"role model\" for oth er residents. VI.FY 21/22 Additional Information: collaboration with ACBH, OAST has restructured for the coming fiscal year in order to better suit the needs of the individuals we serve. The program has hired a new Administrative Manager and a new Clinical Case Manager, both expected to begin in the coming weeks. At that point, OAST will be fully staffed and with a dedicated full-time manager for the first time in well over a year. OAST has adjusted well to the county's adoption of the CalAIM standards, which will allow clinicians and staff to spend less time on documentation and more time providing services to our clients. As a largely field-based program, we continue to try to find creative solutions to transportation challenges. One change implemented in the second half of the fiscal year was to set up a Lyft concierge account for use with our clients, which has been helpful.COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES322 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGOUTREACH / ENGAGEMENT & SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT (OESD) REPORT OESD #: OESD 29 PROVIDER NAME: La Clinica la Raza PROGRAM NAME: Service Team Program Program Description: The Service Team supports clients by building and teaching coping skills, living skills, creating easy access to psychiatric care, and providing housing resources.

Please Describe Ways that the Program Strives to: a.Reduce Mental Health Stigma: La Clinica reduces stigma by use non -stigmatizing language and interchanging the terminology of mental health with emotional well -being, allowing for a more receptive message to be communicated. For example, sadness (tristesa) is a topic used to engage community members, rather than approaching discussions with mental health language terms such as \"depression\". La Clinica emphasizes the improvement in well -being, recognizing disequilibrium, and providing tools and resources for establishing emotional well -being, physical health, and supportive, healthy relationships in one's life. La Cl inica also normalizes the mental health symptoms and promotes recovery through treatment. La Clinica supports individuals and families in becoming active participants in their own healing process by drawing upon their own talents, skills, knowledge, intere sts, dreams, passions, culture and connections. b.Create a Welcoming Environment: La Clinica has created a welcoming environment for clients in many ways. The art that is posted in waiting rooms, hallways and treatment rooms is soothing and culturally releva nt to Latinx families. In addition, La Clinica utilizes a strength -based, family focused cultural approach that identifies, supports and reinforces each Latino individual and family's critical strengths and protective characteristics to help build resilien cy and reduce risk.COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES323 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGLa Clinica also uses culturally based methods including \"dichos\" (proverbs) and \"Pl\u00e1ticas\" or individual/family sessions to engage participants and employ culturally familiar stories and discussions. One example is the dicho \" No hay m al porbien no venga \" (there is nothing so bad from which something good cannot come), which may be used with participants struggling with depression or loss and helps them to identify that amidst their struggle, someone may have reached out to them and sho wn care or offered assistance (for example) that can be noted and appreciated to help them feel better. III. Language Capacity for this Program: English and Spanish . IV. FY 21/22 challenges: Two clinicians who had some of their FTE dedicated to Service T eam clients resigned this fiscal year.

These services assist adults with SMI to decrease or even diminish mental health symptoms in order to integrate into a community, successfully.

FY 21/22: a.Number of Unique Clients Served: 109 Cost per client: $10,396 How Well Did We Do? II. Please Describe Ways that the Program Strives to: a.Reduce Mental Health Stigma: La Familia' s organizational values aligned with MHSA's principles. We strive to operate our program with these values in mind. Belonging - we help those around us feel important, connected, and confident in a community of hope. This sense of belonging is rooted in c ompassion and respect for shared cultures, values, and lived experiences Partnership - we engage in meaningful partnerships with organizations, communities, and the people we serve. Self-determination - we help people to recognize and build on their talen ts, strengths and goals to enhance their self -determination, leadership and power. Social Justice - we amplify the voices of our community to fight for systems, policies, opportunities and services that promote social and economic justice and improve the quality of life for all. Integrity - we hold ourselves to the highest standards of respect, truthfulness, follow through and accountability. As a result, we achieve measurable results for the people and communities we serve.COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES325 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGThe Program team strives to reduce mental health stigma for the clients. One way to achieve this is to help make services accessible for the clients, providing the client knowledge about their symptoms, and about resources they can use (internal) coping skills or external (community resources) to improve their mental health symptoms. Our case managers provide a majority of their service out in the field or homes to make services accessible. The Program staff strive to support client to link to the team psychiatrist to improve their m ental health symptoms via the benefit of taking medications consistently. The Program staff provide psychoeducation about the client symptoms to the client and their families. Additionally, Clients receive coaching, to enhance their daily living activities , and learn coping skills. Also monitoring at risk behaviors is another important part of the work the Program staff and creating safety plans and efforts to reduce the risks. b.Create a Welcoming Environment: La Familia's value of belonging speaks to creating the welcoming environment to our clients. This value along with the other ones noted above , are integrated into the organization to remind staff of the values, such as at All Agency Staff meetings. The Program s taff p rovid e unconditional positive regard, empathy, compassion and respect to the program clients to help the clients feel welcomed. Staff provide services to clients and their families in the Spanish language helping them receive s upport in their native langu age or their preferred language. All of the programs staff are bilingual Spanish and English and many are also bi -cultural. La Familia respects and values their staff and clients for their variety of cultural diversity and provide culturally sensitive s ervices. As mentioned previously, making services accessible by staff serving client in the field or in their homes helps clients feel like the staff are going the extra mile to support them and this fosters a sense of being welcomed and a sense of belon ging. The Program staff provide consistent services for our client also helps create a predictable, safe and welcoming space for our clients. III. Language Capacity for this Program: All the program staff are bilingual Spanish and English speaking . IV. FY 21/22 challenges: Sadly, La Familia Service Team Program has had 3 clients who have passed away this past year. La Familia in the Service Team Program do have clients for multiple years and some are age 70 or older that are facing aging health issues and sometimes isolates, many are living in skilled nursing facilities or boarding care homes. There is one client wh o has the diagnosis of dementia and has interacted with the legal system whom we are currently working with Behavioral Health Court to support him and working towards finding him long term appropriate housing. The program has several clients who are homel ess (with challenges with engaging in services, challenges with med compliance, and refusal to use shelters) and for such clients their case manager worked hard to try to locate the client in the community and also some were referred to other services like IHOT or higher level of care like FSP. To find appropriate housing for the program aging clients is a challenge. Some of the program's clients struggle with substance use and display challenges with wanting to engage consistently with their service prov ider and often decline linkage to SUD treatment programs. Additionally, some of the program's clients may struggle with Benzodiazepine or other prescribed medications. The Program's Psychiatric Prescribers provide a plan to best support each patient with high tolerance to medications like those who are frequently seeking specific medications (like Benzodiazepine) outside the medications that the La Familia psychiatric prescriber has approved. Some COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES326 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGinterventions Psychiatric Prescriber may utilize is to mo nitor polypharmacy usage by specific patients using web -based system accessible for psychiatric prescribers, come up with a specific medication plan, and coordinate care with other medical providers, review medication records and utilize lab testing. The program Team works together to support the programs client's around their medication compliance. For example, the program's Case Managers support clients with the following interventions: linking the client to the psychiatric provider, supporting the client to get medication refills, assisting with medications delivered, supporting the client with organizing medications in a pill organizer, assisting the client with getting their lab tests or following up with their primary care providers, following up with the client's family or caretaker about medication compliance, and problem solving issues that may arise and report back to the team on challenges. Another challenge is that some program clients due to their severe mental illness impairments and for some p aranoia may not be receptive to wanting to visit their primary care physicians. Staff work using motivational interviewing techniques, coaching about the importance of seeing a doctor, and often implement a reward system (gift card) to encourage clients t o have an appointment with their primary care provider for clients that struggle in this area. With an increase in TAY clients this year, especially towards the end of the fiscal year (May -June 2022) the program management is looking into supporting staff in receiving training in how to work with this special population in a manner that can foster their adult independence skills and desire to seek out employment opportunities. Staff utilize linking clients to the vocation program. A final challenge to me ntion is that some clients may not qualify for public benefits like SSI/SSA, Boarding Care, or other housing opportunities, which creates barriers to access needed resources. The Staff work to support such clients in utilizing other community resources th at can help fill the need as much as it can. Providing Services during C OVID Pandemic for In -Person Face- to-Face Mental Health Services: The Program continued the 2021 and 2022 year with providing services primarily in person. We did provide more remot e services during shelter in place events that occurred especially in the timeframe of: January and February months of the 2021 year, because of the high number of C OVID outbreaks. Otherwise, we have been able to resume services while using C OVID safety protocols. We also continued to utilize the implemented technology and case managers assist clients with accessing their psychiatric providers via remote services/telehealth sessions. We also implemented video conference office rooms for clients to utiliz e and see their psychiatric provider, who is remote with their case manager present in the room with them. Barriers to Medi -Cal & Private Insurance: Our clients come to us with Medi -Cal, or Medi -Cal or Medi - Care and or Health Pack insurance. Some challen ges we have faced this past fiscal year was that clients whose Medi-Cal expire for a variety of reasons. Clients may show registered in another county for example. Is anyone better off? V. FY 21/22 Client Impact: Over this past fiscal year, we have continued to have services in person. Many of our case managers provide services in clients' homes, boarding cares, visit clients at hospitals, or provide them support out in the community or \"field\" such as by taking t hem to doctor appointments etc... Our Case Managers also help search for clients in the community for those that are homeless orCOMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES327 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGthose that have gone AWOL. Our clients benefit most from in person services and the program staff have successfully been able t o meet the need of clients with continuing to provide services in person. Many of the program clients have severe mental illness such as Schizophrenia and may have problems with organizing and keeping remote appointments without assistance. For clients t hat also face the challenge of being homeless, having a case manager that is willing to look for them, has resulted in increased the chances of client engagement with the services. The program supports the clients to link to the vocational program for tho se interested in employment. The program supports clients to maintain their psychiatric appointments. The program also supports clients who need help with money management via the sub payee program. The program works to reduce homelessness or risk of homelessness by helping them maintain their housing, support those with finding housing such as use of temporary housing and applying to board and care homes. Staff work to improve client's health, mental health and well- being by helping to overcoming barri ers to access to social determinants of health by linking client to community resources. La Familia has installed monitors and webcams for clients to utilize in the conference rooms to speak to their psychiatric providers who are remote with the assistan ce of the case manager present. This provides the opportunity for the client to use a large screen monitor to interact with their psychiatric provider while having the safety of the case manager present. The opportunity also provides the case manager th e information about clients' medications to help encourage client medication compliance. VI.FY 21/22 Additional Information: The program faced some staff turn-over this past fiscal year; however, we were able to get 2 new Case Managers this summer of 2022 to replace our staff that left in Spring of 2022 and the program Staff Therapist position became vacant this Summer of 2022. VII. Projections of Clients Changes: The program plans to hire a Staff Therapist. The program is implementing the Cal Aim changes to documentation. The program is looking to continue to increase clients seeing their primary care doctor a minimum of 1 x a year. The program is looking to learn how to provide appropriate interventions that can instill gaining adult living skills, and independence and linkage to employment to support the increase of TAY clients referred to the program.COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES328 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGOUTREACH / ENGAGEMENT & SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT (OESD) REPORT OESD #: OESD 29 PROVIDER NAME: Asian Health Services PROGRAM NAME: Service Team Program Program Description: The Service Team supports clients by building and teaching coping skills, living skills, creating easy access to psychiatric care, and providing housing resources.

It is staffed by peers, in alignment with the objectives of our local agencies - Peers Organizing Community Change (POCC) and the Alameda County Accelerated Peer Specialist Program (ACAPS). Guests receive support from compassionate peer staff and can stay for up to 14 days. Sally's Place Peer Respite is a voluntary, short -term program that provides non-clinical crisis support to help people find new understanding an d ways to move forward with their recovery. It operates 24 hours per day in a homelike environment. Target Population: Sally's Place serves adults, 18 years of age or older, who are experiencing mental health concerns or distress, have an identified place to stay in Alamed a County at the time of intake, are able to manage medical needs independently and who voluntarily agree to engage in services.

FY 21/22: a.Number of Unique Clients Served: Sally 's Place has provided Peer suppo rt Servic es to 86 unduplicated new guests and re-admitted 121 guests that had returned who required more support either with referrals or respite services. Cost per client: $5,103 How Well Did We Do? II. Please Describe Ways that the Program Strives to: a.Reduce Mental Health Stigma: Here at Sally's Place we do not focus on diagnosis; even the staff have lived experiences which they share with the guests to demonstrate how recovery and wellness are possible in spite of mental health stigma. The staff provide compassion and support to encourage, educate and teach many tools or ways to advocate for themselves are given while guests are using the respite services here at Sally's Place. b.Create a Welcoming Environment: At Sally's Place we keep the house safe and clean at all times. Before g uests arrive all the staff are made aware of the arrival date and time. The staff that are on shift on the designated date prepares the room for the guest to arrive. There are times the guest doesn't have transportation so the Peer Advocate will provide th e transportation to Sally's Place free of charge. When the guest arrives the two staff on shift comes to meet the guest at the door with introductions and one of our staff shows the guest around the house, to their room, and before completing necessary wel coming packet the staff ask the guest if they would like to sit down and caught their breath first and maybe have a bite to eat. III. Language Capacity for this Program: We strive to keep our staff as diverse as possible and 30% of staff is bilingual (Spanish/English).

IV. FY 21/22 challenges: Even though we have a current process on reaching the interested, pending and return guests that are on the waiting list still face challenges with matching the bed availability to the immediate need for respite services. Sometimes when the bed becomes available here at Sally's Place we have difficulty making contact with the next guest which sometimes results in a waitlist. Sally's Place has continuously received referrals that exceeds the established bed capacity. That is, we have far more people who are interested - and qualify for - services at Sally's Place than we do available beds. This is good because it means that word is getting out about our services and that guests and providers are sharing their positive experiences, bu t the challenge for staff is holding the knowledge that many of these individuals will go unserved. It is also challenging when we receive a referral from a case manager, they will give a qualifying address for the guest, but once the guest arrives to Sa lly's Place, the guest will state that they are effectively homeless. Our current resolution is to forward the information to our Peer Advocate who works on housing during the 14 day stay. We have been successful in finding a housing option for these guest s upon exit from Sally's Place. In order to resolve this, we do our best to be as clear as possible about the criteria and explain the rationale to referring providers. We have also worked to identify alternatives to Sally's Place for individuals who do no t meet our criteria. Another challenge that some of the staff at Sally's Place is with staff sharing their personal story in ways that can be triggering to guests; the staff have been coached on how to do more listening and how to thoughtfully gauge how m uch self -disclosure is useful and helpful for the guests. Is anyone better off? V. FY 21/22 Client Impact: Sally's Place impacted 58 African Americans, 23 Caucasian, 24 Mexican/Mexican Americans, 94 Non -Hispanic or Non -Latino, 0 Vietnamese, 2 Asian, 0 Am erican Indian or Alaska Native, 5 Another Race not listed , 4 Unknown, 1 Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, 0 Other Non -Caucasian community members. Having only 35 guest's return for services at Sally's Place may mean that they were feeling bette r also connected to helpful supportive services. Data shows that Sally's Place have served and supported 40 Females, 52 males and one unknown/unclassified.

The first is the Youth Group; this group is focused on providing psychoeducation around psychotic and bipolar symptoms, building coping skill s, developing a social network between the program youth and normalizing mental health experiences. It is regularly attended by 3 to 7 transition age youth. Felton also restarted the virtual Family Group in 2022, in which Felton staff provides psychoeducat ion to families of the youth. In addition, Felton has an ongoing outreach program; Felton staff has presented our program and provided psychoeducation about mental health issues to a variety of community programs, including NAMI family groups, a local synagogue, inpatient programs, and case management programs. Felton staff provided mental health resources to participants and strongly encouraged de -stigmatization at all the program's community presentations. In addition, Felton staff uses various strat egies that are non- stigmatizing and non -discriminatory with the youth and families served. b.Create a Welcoming Environment: In the office, the Felton staff have created a space that is TAY friendly by incorporating youth -friendly art in the office spac e. Felton staff have also developed resource centers, providing a variety of materials to the youth and their families about psychoeducation around mental health symptoms and interventions, substance use treatment resources and vocational and educational r esources. Felton staff have also created a youth -oriented lending library; the program is encouraging engagement through reading. Felton staff have created an environment that reflects ethnic and cultural diversity which is also reflected in the program ma terials. Felton staff is responsive to the cultural needs of our youth and their families, encourage cultural expressions, and use client -centered and non -discriminatory language. Felton staff consistently attend mandatory cultural responsiveness trainin gs on creating a welcoming environment for LGBTQIA+ youth and SOGIE. However, due to COVID -19 and in compliance with Public Health guidelines, Felton staff have continued to implement changes to the office space to promote health and safety during the pandemic, such as a sanitation station, staff and visitor sign-in log and furniture spaced 6 feet apart. Although these changes made the environment slightly less welcoming (temporarily discontinued snacks, games, and rearranged furniture in common areas), Felton staff have approached them from a community -safety perspective and use every opportunity to educate program participants and caregivers on COVID -19 symptoms, use of face covering, proper hand washing, social distancing guidelines, and instructions to a void physical contact. III. Language Capacity for this Program: Currently, Felton's staffing language capacity includes English and Spanish. Overall, the programs served 70 participants in English and 6 participants in Spanish. In addition, Felton staff have prompt access to interpreter services as needed for other threshold languages.

Felton staff strive to provide as many sessions as clinically appropriate via Zoom and phone calls; however, many of the youth and their families prefer and require face -to-face contact. To help prevent the spread of COVID -19, Fe lton is providing KN95 masks to all staff for in -person visits. In addition, Felton have obtained at -home rapid COVID -19 tests to test staff and clients if there is a potential exposure. This has helped keep many of the youth and their families engaged wit h services. In addition, Felton staff continued to deliver group support; the programs are currently providing both a Youth group and a Family Support group via Zoom once per week. This required a great deal of adaptability on the part of Felton staff, th e youth and their families. In order to reduce staff vacancies, Felton Institute has developed better recruitment strategies; Felton have invested in a recruiting service called ICIMS. This service aggressively seeks new recruits across a variety of job r ecruitment websites. In addition, Felton have also reached out to local colleges, reentry programs and BestNOW. Over the past 12 months, the Felton (re)MIND\u00ae and BEAM programs have hired a Peer Support Specialist (a BestNOW Graduate) and an additional SE ES/IPS staff from a local college. The programs also hired a bilingual clinical care manager as well as a clinical care manager. Our only remaining vacancies are for a bilingual master's level care manager/therapist and a peer support specialist. With COVID -19 restrictions lessening, Felton staff remain hopeful to be able to continue to provide the full scope of case management, psychiatric and employment/education services. Is anyone better off? V. FY 21/22 Client Impact: Impact Objective was to have an 80% decrease in CS, PHF, and psychiatric hospital admissions for the youth served for 12 months or more. During this reporting period, there were 30 youth who had received services for 12 months or more. Of these 30 youth, 25 individuals had at least one admission to CS, PHF, or psychiatric hospital in the previous 12 months before enrollment. Sixteen out of these 25 youth (64.0%) showed reduction in the total number of crisis stabilization or inpatient services episodes. While the programs were unable t o reach the Impact Objective of having 80% of the participants have a reduction in the inpatient admissions, many of the youth experienced increased anxiety and paranoia as a result of the impact of COVID and its social isolation, increasing their need for hospitalization. A notable outcome related to reduction in inpatient services is that 14 of the 25 (56.0%) youth who had prior inpatient stays did not have any CS, PHF, or psychiatric hospital stays after entering the program. The Felton (re)MIND\u00ae and B EAM programs were successful in helping 56.0% of these youth re -integrate into the community and return home to their families. Thus, these youth were able to avoid the debilitating effects of any further hospitalizations. It should also be noted that F elton was successful in assisting several clients from entering the inpatient system. Five participants, because they had no history of inpatient care, were excluded from group of clients receiving 12 months or more of services; these five participants continued to not have any inpatient stays. If these participants were included in the outcome for reduced or zero hospitalizations, the outcome measure would be 76.7% of all youth did not have an increase in hospitalizations. The Felton (re)MIND\u00ae program w as successful in helping these youth undergoing early psychosis symptoms from ever entering the inpatient system. Personal Client/Success Story: For FY 2021 -22, the Felton programs had a number of success stories. One such story involved a youth who was s truggling with severe depression with psychotic features while they attended college at Howard University. As a result of their symptoms, they were hospitalized COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES338 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGseveral times and withdrew from Howard University. After returning to the Bay Area to live wi th family, they were referred to the program almost 2 years ago. While in the program, they continued to struggle with depression and substance use. With supportive therapy, medication services and family support, they were able to better manage their sy mptoms; they have been clean and sober for many months and they have not been back to the hospital in 1.5 years. In fact, they have applied to and been reaccepted into Howard University; they plan to restart Howard this Fall. At the time of writing this report, the client and their father are researching apartments in the DC area that are close to Howard University; they are both excited about their return to college. The youth attributes their success to the support they received from their Felton staff . Another success story is about a young person who has struggled with psychotic symptoms for several years. Prior to the onset of their symptoms, they were working as a manager at a local sandwich shop; they were also on track to attend college. Howeve r, their symptoms disrupted their life; they lost their job and had to move back home with their family. Initially, they were difficult to engage; after having multiple bad experiences with hospitalizations, they were reluctant to accept services and decl ined to take psychotropic medications. Felton staff took a supportive, engaging and recovery -focused approach to providing care; with a great deal of encouragement, the client accepted Felton services and learned coping skills to better manage their sympt oms. With a great deal of coaching and support from our IPS staff, the client was able to apply to and be accepted at Civicorps; they have been working there for several months now. The client states that they love their job; they also report that their quality of life is much better, thanks to the support they received through the Felton (re)MIND program. VI.

VII.Projections of Clients to be Served: Our programs are expecting to serve 100 unduplicated individuals for each fiscal year22/23 - 25/26. VIII. FY 22/23 Programs or Service Changes: Our programs plan to continue to adapt the services due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To address the challenges due to COVID-19, Felton staff have developed a hybrid model of service delivery. Felton staff continued to provide face-to -face services to the TAY youth in the community as well as in the programs' offices, using all COVID-19 safety precautions. Felton staff provided in-person visits to all individuals who were assessed as high-risk and/or who did not have access to telehealth or phone communication, during shelter-in -place, and this was extended to new referrals. Felton staff also created accessibility for staff to be able to provide telehealth through Zoom for Healthcare and for faxes to be sent and received electronically.

Target Population: The Suicide Prevention Crisis line provides a 24 -Hour phone line for assistance to people of all ages an d backgrounds during times of crisis, or their families, to work to prevent the suicide. Translation is available in more than 140 languages. We also offer teletype (TDD) services for deaf and hearing -impaired individuals. How Much Did We Do? I. FY 21/22: a.Number of Unique Clients Served: 10,510 Clients ACBH portion of total program budget:$275,165 How Well Did We Do? II. Please Describe Ways that the Program Strives to: a.Reduce Mental Health Stigma: One major component of mental health stigma is the stigma around asking for help. Having 988 be an easy to remember number to access the crisis line service normalizes the act of reaching out for mental health care. For example, one caller stated they were struggling with suicidal experiences and have thought about reaching out for a while. Seeing advertisem ents about 988 motivated them to call for the first time. Our 988 Alameda County Collaborative invites community members who may not have considered themselves as part of the crisis continuum to join. This empowers the community leaders to talk about ment al health services with their constituents, further normalizing help seeking behavior. We share information about our team mates on social media and 988AlamedaCounty.org website. The teammates share their own lived experiences with mental health challenges . This demystifies the crisis line services and hopefully increases the caller's confidence in reaching out for help. Lastly, we've spoken to the media including the SF Chronicle and El Tecolote. We hope that stories and pictures of the crisis line program and our agency and team mates encourage people to utilize the services. b.Create a Welcoming Environment: Our recruitment efforts prioritize equity. We are actively recruiting for a workforce (with paid positions) that reflects the diverse ethnic and cultural communities of Alameda County, and demonstrates knowledge and/or understanding of the cultural beliefs, practices, and language needs of the populations considered un -served, underserved, or inappropriately served. We want folks who belong to grou ps and communities that have been historically marginalized and harmed by systemic racism and other forms of oppression and folks who have linguistic capacity to provide services in one of the Alameda County threshold languages. This value is systematicall y woven into our recruitment and hiringCOMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES340 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGpractices including updated job descriptions, flyers and posters, interview questions, and hiring process. III. Language Capacity for this Program: English mostly. Crisis Line Counselors have access to 24/7 interpre ter services in more than 140 languages via Language Lines Solutions. We understand that native speakers are more effective than interpretation services because of their cultural understanding when providing mental health services. We currently have 1 -5 na tive Spanish speakers, as well as 1 Korean speaker on the team. We continue to recruit bilingual staff and incentive their position at CSS with annual stipends. IV. FY 21/22 challenges: Staff shortage with paid staff and volunteers continues to be a chall enge. With the state of the pandemic and the economy, fewer people are able to volunteer their time, especially for the crisis line role that requires a high level of knowledge, skill, and time commitment. It also takes longer to acquire the knowledge and skills for volunteers who typically work 4 hours/week. We created a new paid phone counselor where their primary duty is to answer the crisis lines and county af ter- hours line. They typically work 10 -40 hours/week. We've been successful in recruiting the staff and now are in the process of training them. Is anyone better off? V. FY 21/22 Client Impact: IMPACT MEASURES IMPACT OBJECTIVES ACTUAL IMPACT Objective Met?

Only a single question can be set up at a time so we alternated the questions below ea ch month between July -February. During the survey period we had 23,134 calls. Of those the survey was completed 1192 times by callers for a conversion rate of 5.15% of qualifying calls. To reach our goal of surveying 10% of calls we will likely need to adjust our practices, perhaps scripting in a reminder message from the counselor at the en d of calls. Here are some positive se ntiments shared on the survey: The counselor I spoke to today was really awesome. He listene d, validated, and encouraged me, and I definitely felt a little bit better with the grief I was dealing with after talking to him. Thank you for all you do on this line. I just want to say thank you for answering the phone, because that is an amazing thing. I just needed someone to hear me and to get these feelings out of my head. I will definitely share this number with my fami ly and friends. This counselor was really good. I have some serious stuff going on. Scary and sad stuff. And she was so helpful. She was making me feel it was normal to feel what I was feeling and that there was hope for the future. She listened to me and she gave me a lot of good information and I am just so appreciative of this service. VI.FY 21/22 Additional Information: N/A VII. 22/23 Programs or Service Changes: 988 is the new easy to remember number to reach the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (the Lifeline) which has been around since 2005, providing access to crisis lines through more than 200 local crisis centers across the country. Calls from 510, 341, and some 925 area codes ring to our crisis line program. In partnership with Stephanie Lewis and Alameda County Behavioral Health, CSS created the Alameda County 988 Collaborative - A collaboration of first responders, crisis services providers, mobile crisis teams, peer responders, family advocates, and anyone who provides care along the crisis continuum. We have a shared vision of an Alameda County where everyone - in all our diversity - has ease of access to life saving services. We hope to facilitate communication and collaboration with each other - as well as state and federal stakeholders as we move towards a more robust and connected crisis system. Working together, we will continue to educate the community and general public about accessing crisis services and realistic expectations of what our system can offer. We are so inspired by everyone's dedication and hard work meeting the crisis needs of Alameda County. The key objectives of the 988 Alameda County Collaborative include: 1.Facilitating communicatio n between al l county, community -based organizations, first responders, crisis stabilization, crisis residential, peer respite and anyone who provide services along the crisis continuum. 2.Establish protocols with every 911 call center to transfer non -violent, non -emerge ncy, mental health and substance use related calls to the crisis line program. 3.Communicate to the public information about services along the crisis continuumCOMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES342 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGOUTREACH / ENGAGEMENT & SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT (OESD) REPORT OESD #: OESD 32 PROVIDER NAME: Crisis Support Services PROGRAM NAME: Zero Suicide Program Program Description: The Zero Suicide program includes 4 components: Hospital follow -up, Survivors of Suicide Attempt groups, Educational presentations at Santa Rita Jail, and outreach and education to health providers.

II. Please Describe Ways that the Program Strives to: a.Reduce Mental Health Stigma: Both the educational componen ts of the program specifically address stigma regarding suicide at a systemic level as part of the curriculum. SOSA groups and Hospital Follow -up contacts are able to address stigma around help seeking on an individual group through providing positive help seeking experiences and being a bridge to appropriate level of care. b.Create a Welcoming Environment: The two educational components address this at a systemic level by helping other systems be more welcoming to those experiencing mental health challenges and suicidality specifically. The SOSA groups and Hospital Follow -up are exp licitly our opportunity to provide caring connections, meet clients where they are at, and use those with lived experiences as a way to be welcoming. III. Language Capacity for this Program: Hospital Follow up supervisor is bilingual in Spanish. All other services are provided in English only. IV. FY 21/22 challenges: Outreach and education to health providers: Before the onset of the C OVID -19 pandemic, outreaching to primary care clinics and other healthcare settings in Alameda County was challenging partly due to the inherent nature of community health clinics being very busy and finding time for a training. Many of our trainings frequently occurred during a time when a clinic was closed for lunch. In these 2 years of the pandemic, we hosted virtual p resentations for health care providers nearly every month and on different days and times in order to attempt to reach our target population whoCOMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES343 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGwere among the most important frontline workers against COVID -19. A 15 of 25 significant challenge was that while registration would be high at times for these workshops, attendance was about 50% or less. Other times, registration would be low, and would need to cancel. Survivors of Suicide Attempt (SOSA) groups: Our SOSA group had fewer referrals and less attende es, with the highest number of attendees in one group being four. The mean number of attendees was two throughout the first cycle, and ended with one consistent participant. A decision was made to put the group on pause in order to do more outreach. Clinic al program staff developed a plan to offer the group at a community setting over the summer as a part of our outreach attempts. The BACS Hedco Wellness Drop -in Center agreed to host the SOSA group, and the first group was June 23rd. Modifications were made to the curriculum to allow for a drop -in model while keeping the intent of the curriculum intact. As of 6/30, fifteen individuals agreed to attend two groups, all of whom were coping with housing insecurity and mental health challenges. This is an increas e of more than four times our highest attended SOSA group. The program plans to explore ways to increase accessibility and develop connections with agencies providing adjacent services to increase engagement. Is anyone better off? V.FY 21/22 Client Impact: Below are some direct feedback from our hospital follow up program. Considering the elevated risk for suicide for those who have recently been hospitalized, the ability to build individual connections and provide positive help seeking experiences is at the core of this service.

FY 21/22: a.Number of Unique Clients Served: 26 Cost per client: $11,452 How Well Did We Do? II. Please Describe Ways that the Program Strives to: a.Reduce Mental Health Stigma: by educating the community and providers about Deaf culture, norms, beliefs, and values and that the Deaf community feels proud about their Deaf identity and helping Deaf individuals to reclaim their identity. DCCS also educates the community about demonst rating social model of deafness rather than deficit model, which is a perspective that a Deaf person needs to be \"fixed\" or believe to have little to no decision -making capabilities, which lead to internalized stigma among the Deaf community. b.Create a Wel coming Environment: DCCS uses promotional materials stating that this is a safe space for Deaf -friendly LBTQIA+ community and all DCCS staff are fluent in American Sign Language. Staff also attends students' IEP meetings and other multidisciplinary meeting s as requested by providers, schools, parents/caregivers, and clients. III. Language Capacity for this Program: English and American Sign Language (ASL) . ASL Therapists and Case Managers are fluent in American Sign Language and ProTactile Sign Language. Some of the staff are oral English speakers who can work with Hard of Hearing clients who rely on oral English communication and lipreading only. IV. FY 21/22 challenges: The referrals have increased dramatically after the program director restragized referral system and outreach efforts and program is understaffed.

With the increasing referrals, the interpre ting expenses have exceeded in order to accommmdate interpreter requests. Is anyone better off? V.FY 21/22 Client Impact: A youth was referred to DCCS for services to address self harm and suicidal behavior, which prevented this youth from living in a dormority due to risk of safety to self. After three months of providing services, the client no longer demonstrates self harm and suidicial behavior and was able to return to school domoriity, thus reducing caregiver's long drive from home to the school doromority and relationship with caregiver has improved. VI. FY 21/22 Additional Information: The program director focused on workforce development by establishing a DCCS internship program and have recruited 3 interns from various universities. One of the interns' specialties is art therapy and the program director assisted the intern and developed art therapy program for the Deaf clients to participate in. The program director strategized and increased hiring and outreach efforts by attending conferences in another state, providing presentations, training, and consultation to service providers, and collaborating with Felton Institute's communication team. As a result, DCCS received more than 100 referrals in the past 12 months. By the end of this fiscal year, DCCS hired 1 Administrative Manager/Interpreter and 1 full-time case manager. DCCS recently added more positions and have been interviewing candidates. Most of them learned about DCCS through word of mouth in the Deaf community after program director increased networking with other states as well as attending out of state conference. VII. FY 22/23 Projections of Clients to be Served: The DCCS program hopes to serve 40 adults and 10 for children in each fiscal year 22/23 - 25/26 .

FY 21/22: a.Number of Unique Clients Served: 1,452 per client: $87 How Well D id We Do? II. Please Describe Ways that the Program Strives to: a.Reduce Mental Health Stigma: AFS has helped reduce mental he alth stigma at 3 different high schools in Alameda this year. Our School -Based Health Center (SBHC) staff, in coordination with our Youth Advisory Board Members organize and facilitate classroom presentations and tabling events focused on suicide awareness and prevention, healthy relationships (creating awareness around the cycle of violence, warning signs), and how to identify as well as manage stress and anxiety (around finals). All of the outreach efforts are focused on reducing stigma by both openly talking about mental health concerns and normalizing them within the school community. Students who attend a presentation or participate at one of the lunchtime fairs will obtain information about a mental health topic, how to identify when something is a concern, and how to reach out for support both on campus and in the community. Students become aware of the SBHC and its serv ices throughout the year and even self -refer for mental health services. b.Create a Welcoming Environment: Students engaging with our events is key to our success, therefore we place a great deal of emphasis on creating a welcoming environment at all of our lunchtime tabling fairs. One of the first ways that we do this is by having the tables hosted in partners hip with our Youth Advisory Board members. We aim to eliminate the barrier of a student being intimidated to come to a table hosted solely by adults. Once a student is at a table, they are greeted by an array of colorful and informative flyers, handouts, a nd an activity designed to promote education on the topic or practice a self -care/coping skill. Students are then encouraged to participate in the other activities as we have no less than 4 distinct tables at each of our events. Our SBHC team knows the vulnerability a student has when they come to the SBHC for the first time to ask questions and/or seek mental health support. Our staff make every effort to create a warm, welcoming environment. Teachers and school faculty are at the classroom presentationsCOMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES347 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGand also stop by our tabling events. We also make sure to support and appreciate those responders who identify and then refer youth to our services. III. Language Capacity for this Program: We currently offer services in English. IV. FY 21/22 challenges : A challenge this year was deciding if we were going to host in -person events and if we were, how would we prioritize the health and safety of our staff, the Youth Advisory Board, and the student community. We spent time evaluating options and brainstormi ng solutions. Once school started and we saw the energy that students had returning on campus we quickly made the decision that all of our events will be in -person. To mitigate risks, we held all of our events outside and had all of our staff and Youth Adv isory Board members wear masks. We set up hand sanitizer stations at each of the tables. We created QR codes so that students could take surveys on their own devices rather than sharing a tablet. Is anyone better off? V. FY 21/22 Client Impact: Outreach efforts are focused on increasing students' awareness about mental health, as well as where and how to seek support if in need. Students who attend our events, classroom presentations, or interact with our social media receive information about a variety of mental health topics. We provide students with local and accessible resources both on campus and in the community. Additionally, we ask students to fill out a survey as they leave our events to provide us information on what they learned, their knowledg e about where to access support if needed, and suggestions for future topics. Of the students who participated in the surveys, 95% reported learning something new about the topic of the event. And 94% of the students reported knowing/learning that they c ould access mental health services at the SBHC if needed. Approximately half of the students that we serve at the SBHCs are self - referral, highlighting that students are going to the SBHC on their own with the knowledge they can obtain mental health suppor t. The impact of this program is also extremely influential on the Youth Advisory Board members. The students who volunteer to be a part of the Youth Advisory Boards have a passion for the health and wellbeing of their peers and community. These youth de dicate time to learn about mental health topics in an effort to spread awareness and reduce stigma. A number of the youth who participate in the Youth Advisory Board actually access mental health services for the first time after having joined. They also provide feedback to our staff and clinicians about how to better support the needs of the school community. VI.FY 21/22 Additional Information: N/A VII.

We want to ensure staff are supported with engaging clinical tools to aid in building recovery and resilience with youth/families, create an intentional system that is accessible to staff and can be utilized and improved together over time, and hope that this will cr eate lasting change and help staff feel they have access to the tools to do their work, and do it well. III. Language Capacity for this Program: While the data we collected informed us that the primary language needs at Castlemont and Roosevelt are unknow n for the 3,596 services, our services were predominantly provided in English. Staff spoke with students, caregivers, and site staff in English when conducting services.COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES349 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGIV. FY 21/22 challenges: 21-22 continued to be a challenging year as we continue to n avigate the pandemic and its unknowns. While almost all learning and engagement occurred in -person and onsite, there continued to be inconsistency in attendance, causing inconsistency in services provided by EBAC. Additionally, parent/ family contact on a consistent basis was a challenge. Due to the ongoing pandemic challenges, several families shared feeling stressed and/or overwhelmed while juggling home life and work. Is anyone better off? V.FY 21/22 Client Impact: Over the course of the year, students were impacted at various times of the year. Despite the staffing challenges at Roosevelt, having a smaller caseload/number of students allowed for increased 1:1 support and student growth. Multiple students were more engaged both academically and with mental health services and were motivated to meet their individual goals. At Castlemont, the freshman displayed some difficulty adjusting to a new school environment but multiple students actively participated in services, obtained support in their mainstream classes, and seniors were on-track to graduate. VI. FY 21/22 Additional Information: One of our on-going challenges has been related to data systems. Our team is working to ensure data is entered in a timely manner and the county is receiving the information correctly. There are a lot of \"unknowns\" in the data. The staff are only collecting what is in the Alameda County Survey Monkey so we do not have any data on Veteran Status, Sex at Birth, Disability, etc. VII. FY 22/23 - 25/26 Projections of Clients to be Served: EBAC is anticipating changes to the number of clients being served as the classroom size for the 22-23 school year will be increasing on both of our sites (from 4 - 6 students to 8-12 students). We will continue to partner with all available caregivers and collateral supports for each student. We estimate to serve 36 clients in each fiscal year. VIII. FY 22/23 Programs or Service Changes: EBAC is happy to collaborate with new OUSD staff at Roosevelt Middle School. During this time, we are actively learning about the roles and responsibilities between EBAC and new OUSD staff but will continue collaborating on how to best support the clients and their families. EBAC continues to be flexible in providing services and working throug h any COVI D guidelines and restriction s with in-perso n services. As we continue to be in-person, ther e are more opportun ities to work collaborativ ely with schoo l staff to suppo rt clien t need s and conne ct with caregivers.

Number of Unique Clients Served: 33 youth and their families. ACBH portion of total program budget: $273,000 How Well Did We Do? II. Please Describe Ways that the Program Strives to: a.Reduce Mental Health Stigma: We addressed student needs by partnering with educational staff to create trauma -informed classrooms with structured environments, use of positive behavioral systems, and a wide variety of psychosocial supports to develop life skills. Clinicians use a strength- based philosophy to empower youth an d families which looks at the unique strengths and needs across various life domains. We are grounded in a wraparound approach using school, family, and community to collaborate and support the client to address obstacles and challenges they may have to ac cessing their education. b.Create a Welcoming Environment: As a program we strive to provide trauma -informed and culturally/linguistically responsive services in the school, family home, and community. We focus on nurturing healthy and secure attachments wi thin the family and within the school. We support youth with developing skills to advocate for themselves within school and feel successful in their education. Clinicians are strength -based and client -centered, supporting families to feel respected, infor med about their treatment, and connected to positive supports within the school system and community. III. Language Capacity for this Program: We provide all services in English and the use of conversational Spanish when needed. Our Family partner staff s upported 4 of our Spanish speaking parents with navigating systems. All threshold languages are available via Alameda County Behavioral Health Language Phone Line when needed. Printed materials are available in English and Spanish. IV.

Not being fully staff greatly impacted the ability to provide services in key areas such as teacher training, life skills, and college/ career exploration. We experienced challenges with teacher consult on trauma informed interventions and implementing positive behavior systems, related to OUSD tea chers often not engaging in active teaching of lesson plans. Is anyone better off? V.FY 21/22 Client Impact: Though our MHSA funding we continue to make an impact on the climate and culture within the school and our ability to support the I-CESDC students engage in schoolwide events. During this school year school site Life Academy and Fred Finch staff collaborated and planned for ways to ensure the I-CESDC students had every chance available to engage in a month long of post session activities. Historically I-CESDC students are often not engaged in large school activities or looked over due to the needs that they present with. Having MHSA funding has allowed us to make an impact at the school for our clients. We planned ways to ensure clients participation which often was our staff also participating in field trips or seminars. Fred Finch staff provided tools to teachers on ways to engage and supportive interventions to use to encourage client's participation in activities. One particular client benefited from this support. This client has social anxiety that prohibits them often from engaging in school activities, speaking with peers and adults, and a fear of being in the community. With the support of our staff this student was able to attend field trips, rode on BART and a bus for the first time, and was exposed to new experiences. VI. FY 21/22 Additional Information: With the support of MHSA funding (which allows us to have a family partner) we continue to see an increase in family engagement with services and engagement from caregivers in their youth's education. Our monthly caregiver group for ICESDC caregivers continues to be a space for caregivers to support each other on their sucesses and struggles in raising youth in Special Education. VII.

Please Describe Ways that the Program Strives to: a.Reduce Mental Health Stigma: MLK: Although it was challenging to collaborate with components of our school team due to staffing challenges and an unwillingness to partner, our team attempted to support students push into the general education classes and develop positive peer relationships on the playground. We hosted several class room activities that included general education peers and provided leadership opportunities where they modeled appropriate skill sets to younger students. McClymonds: At McClymonds, the stigma of being in an SDC program is quite present. The classroom bein g located on the first floor across from the administration office also reinforces the negative mental health stigma associated with being in an SDC class. The classroom team has created an outdoor space and indoor space for students to take breaks and reg ulate themselves rather than walk the halls. There are program talks of changing the structure of the program so students transition between different SDC classes in the Fall of 2022 so students do not feel they are excluded and kept in the mental health c lassroom. Skyline: The program at Skyline focuses on inclusion and pushing students into their general education classes with their peers. In addition, the students in both Counseling Enriched programs transition between teachers for different periods. As a result, students with mental health needs and supports and not placed in one classroom all day that is often labeled the \"SDC classroom.\" The structure allows for students to feel comfortable and confident being in their classroom rather than being label ed or judged by the peers.COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES353 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGOAK: The OAK team was committed to inclusion to support to reduce the mental health stigma that comes with being in a counseling enriched program. Students were supported by staff in general education classes to support their aca demic progress and goals as well as to expose them the peers in a general education setting. In addition to daily inclusion opportunities both in the classroom and at recess, they joined fieldtrips with the school and with the lower elementary classrooms. b.Create a Welcoming Environment: MLK: It was challenging to create welcoming environments when the students transitioned between multiple teachers due to teacher ass ignments and staffing barriers throughout the school year. In the K -2 classroom the substitute teachers were open to collaborating so we were able to create safe and nurturing environments; however, the staffing rotated which is the foundation for creating a safe and welcoming environment for our students. We greeted students from the bus area with positivity and celebrated with field trips at the end of the school year. McClymonds: The McClymonds team has worked endlessly to create a welcoming environment with a \"doors open\" policy. They transformed their back patio area into a break spac e and look forward to making it a classroom garden in the fall. The staff have also create a break space in the classroom and have snacks and water available for their students. During passing periods and lunch, the staff have tried different activities su ch as playing music, making smoothies, and having games available to foster a comfortable space for students. Skyline: The Skyline team has created a fun and welcoming environment with a \"doors open\" policy. Students enjoy spending passing periods and lunch in the classroom as there is often music playing and students from all grades and programs walking through. OAK: The OAK team did a great job creating a welcoming environment for their students and their families. Although families were still not per mitted on campus due to COVID protocols, when families attended meetings, IEPs, or end of the year events, the team made them feel welcomed. On a daily basis, the OAK team greeted their students at the bus drop off and welcomed them to school. They created fun activities that involved art and cooking to supplement their academic assignments which made learning fun and motivating to engage in. III. Language Capacity for this Program: All students and families at MLK spoke English as a primary language and did not require translation assistance. For Spanish speaking referrals, we had a Spanish speaking behavior staff that could provide translation support and translate all clinical documents. The translation hotline was also a resource for staff. All caregiv ers for clients at McClymonds High School spoke English as their primary language. For Spanish speaking referrals, we had a Spanish speaking behavior staff that could provide translation support and translate all clinical documents. The translation hotline was also a resource for staff. All caregivers for clients at Skyline High School spoke English as their primary language. One student who was enrolled in the program spoke Spanish as did his primary caregiver. The student was 18 and declined services. Our Spanish speaking staff supported the team in communicating with caregiver. For Spanish speaking referrals, we had a Spanish speaking behavior staff that could provide translation support and translate all clinical documents.

FY 21/22 challenges: MLK: In our 3 -5 class, any attempt to collaborate with the teacher continued to result in conflict. Both the students and their families continued to feel the tension in the class room and as a result of the teacher communicating inaccurate information to the families regarding staffing, behavioral incidents, or interventions, our relationships with our families has been impacted. With safety as a priority, we have been able to enga ge with our client's families, but have continued to experience limitations connecting as a community as parents/caregivers are still not permitted in the PODs. McClymonds: The main challenges during the 21/22 school year focused on providing all the nece ssary information and supplies to staff so they felt safe on their school site during the return to classroom and during the numerous shifts in protocols and policies around COVID -19. When the mask mandate was in place, students often did not wear masks or wore them incorrectly (hanging at the chin). Staff struggled to find a balance between redirection and prompting and not initiating a power struggle or causing students to disengage. As a team we embedded wearing masks correctly as part of the level syste m, but students were not motivated. As a result to the inconsistent attendance and engagement throughout the year, staff displayed compassion fatigue towards the end of the school year. As a team we did an end of the school reset to create a positive and e ngaging environment for the last month of school. Skyline: The main challenges during the 21/22 school year focused on providing all the necessary information and supplies to staff so they felt safe on their school site during the return to classroom and during the numerous shifts in protocols and policies around COVID -19.

OAK: The main challenges during the 21/22 school year focused on providing all the necessary information and s upplies to staff so they felt safe on their school site during the return to classroom and during the numerous shifts in protocols and policies around COVID -19. There were some challenging behaviors throughout the school year that were more challenging to intervene due to mask compliance and minimizing reinforcement of avoidant/escape behaviors (e.g. spitting, mask removal). Is anyone better off? V. FY 21/22 Client Impact: MLK: One student in the K -2 classroom who transition to MLK in January responded to classroom interventions and therapy as evident in a significant decrease in unsafe behaviors and aggressive tantrums. By the end of the school year he consistently used coping skills and remained safe. He did not require his OUSD para to intervene and was more responsive to classroom supports. He was able to participate in the end of the year field trip to the Oakland Zoo. In the SDC 3 -5 classroom, both graduating fifth graders reported that they were most proud of their improved reading scores and math sk ills. Both graduates were able to communicate how excited they were to be going to middle school as well as their fears such as being the \"new kid\" and being \"smaller than all the big kids.\" Both students were not as articulate at communicating their feeli ngs as well as reflecting about their experiences. McClymonds: One student engaged in services and the academic curriculum throughout the school year. As a team we were able to create \"wrap around\" like support system for her and her mother to COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES355 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGfacilitate positive changes both at school and home. She received TBS services, psychiatric support, as well as the services from being in a school based mental health program. Skyline: Overall, there were numerous success stories for the school year. Students were taking part in more inclusion opportunities, students went to college tours and museums as part of the level system. Our one graduating senior applied to college and was accepted into his top two college choices. To honor his successes and his family's en gagement, Lincoln recognized this student at our annual ROOTs fundraiser where he was given a scholarship for his college studies. OAK: Overall, there were numerous success stories for the school year. Students were taking part in more inclusion opportunities. The school team joined with a student's family and collaborated with special education to determine a more appropriate placement to meet the student's needs related to his new diagnosis of Autism. After returning from winter break, the stude nt students started participating in a skills group biweekly, facilitated by a Lincoln behavior staff, that taught basic skills around kitchen safety, cleanliness, and basic cooking skills. The students learned to prepare and cut fruit and vegetables and l earned how to make smoothies, lasagna, nachos, of Clients to be Served: MLK: 33 clients will be served in each fiscal year. McClymonds: We are projected to start the year with 9 students, 6 returning and 3 new students. Skyline: We are projected to start the year with 11 students, 8 returning and 3 new students. OAK: All 8 students who ended the year at OAK, will either transition to the 3-5 Seneca run SDC program, transition to a different SDC/CE program at a different school site, or a different special education program to better meet the client's needs. We are projected to start the year with one student. VIII. FY 22/23 Programs or Service Changes: MLK: Due to the program closing, all students in the K-2 SDC/CE program will transition to the SDC/CE program at Sequoia Elementary School. Two students in the 3-5 SDC/CE program will do a lateral transition to their prospective Middle School programs at Edna Brewer and Roosevelt. One student will transition to the SDC/CE program at Sequoia Elementary school and one student will transition to either the Intensive SDC/CE program at Oakland School of Knowledge (OAK) or Maya Angelo NPS program. McClymonds: The clinician assigned to McClymonds plans to return in the fall and the case manager gave notice that she was resigning at the end of July.

How Much Did We Do? 21/22: a.Number of Unique College Now: 353 How Well Did We Do? II. Please Describe Ways that the Program Strives to: a.Reduce Mental Health Stigma: Through Sene ca's Unconditional Education Model (UE), Seneca UE coaches and clinicians work with school staff, administrators, families, and students to support a whole system approach to providing mental health services in schools. UE coaches and clinicians not only c ollaborate with teachers around the individual needs of students but also to develop a social emotional learning curriculum that can support all students' varying needs. UE coaches and clinicians work to support school wide training and implementation of Positive Behavioral Interventions and Support (PBIS) to provide a common understanding of the drivers of student's social emotional challenges as well as trauma -informed and healing centered responses to address them. This work promotes consistent, early, a nd effective interventions to increase student's ability to thrive in their school environment. UE's whole school approach infuses trauma -informed and healing- centered practices into the day -to-day experiences of students, normalizing the need to address t he social emotional development and well- being of everyone in the school community, and reducing stigma around mental health. b.Create a Welcoming Environment: UE coaches and clinicians work with school administration and teachers to assess the culture and climate needs of their schools and provide training, coaching and consultation opportunities. Additionally UE coaches and clinicians partner with their schools ' teams to plan and support staff to implement a social -emotional learningCOMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES357 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGcurriculum, providing intake and outreach support for families and family engagement/involvement activities throughout the school year. Coaches additionally work with the entire sch ool team to identify and implement activities and initiatives that support staff wellness, camaraderie, and positivity. III. Language Capacity for this Program: UE Coaches at CESDC/ICESDC utilize contracted agencies to provide in person/phone interpretati on or translation as needed. Specific languages used and number of people served in each was not able to be tracked for FY 21/22. UE Clinicians at SBBH/ASCEND were bilingual in English and Spanish and able to provide services in both languages as needed. UE Clinicians additionally utilize contracted agencies to provide in person/phone interpretation or translation as needed. Specific languages used and number of people served in each was not able to be tracked for FY 21/22. IV. FY 21/22 challenges: Primary challenges in FY 21/21 continued to center around returning to full time in person learning while also building new systems and supports for safely navigating health and safety guidelines regarding the COVID -19 global pandemic. The beginning of the year brought stress and needs for support in helping teaching staff rebuild routines and relationships. This was also made difficult due to significant staffing shortages at leadership transitions at multiple sites. As things began to normalize through th e fall, these challenges again arose mid -year following the winter break when the Omicron variant surged and both staffing and student absence through February caused barriers to successful implementation of planned structures and supports. After the surge s faded, teams began hitting their strides again and were able to refocus on goals for the year however due to the ongoing impact of changing schedules, timelines and staffing, most sites had to prioritize their focus on deliverables for the end of year, s upporting primarily student and staff social emotional and wellness initiatives and less school wide systems supports. Is anyone better off? V. FY 21/22 Client Impact: ASCEND Deliverable: Contractor shall provide school culture and climate work through so cial-emotional learning curriculum as an ongoing service. Case Study: UE Clinicians have supported the design and implementation of \"Crew\", a space in which students meet three times a week for the first half hour of the school day in groups of 10 -12 stude nts to build community with one another and receive social -emotional support through skill building and positive, joyful experiences. UE Clinicians contributed to the curriculum by providing activity plans for all Crew leaders on identity exploration, empa thy building, mindfulness, and restorative community building practices. UE Clinicians also facilitate their own Crews, which has provided students with critical opportunities to reconnect with one another after a year of isolation and distance learning. A t the beginning of the school year, one student in this clinician's Crew who was new to ASCEND expressed that he did not feel very connected to the school and felt that other kids did not understand him. Due to the flexible structure of Crew, this clinicia n was able to provide brief individual support for this student throughout the week to help him become oriented to the school. Eventually, he also began to share about challenges his family has faced from moving many times, as well as his ongoing process o f exploring his sexuality and gender identity. By creating a culture of safety and community within the Crew space, the clinician was able to support him in sharing some of his vulnerabilities with his peers through the practice of talking circles. He rece ived support and affirmation from his peers, and many of them expressed that they related to him. This allowed for more open conversation around difficult themes impacting students' mental health and wellbeing while deepening trust among Crew members.COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES358 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGThe student has expressed gratitude for the support he received from the clinician and his peers through Crew, and other students have also shared that they appreciate having a space at school where they can support one another and talk about issues that are i mportant to them. Oakland Academy of Knowledge Deliverable: Contractor will participate in school Culture and Climate Committee meetings monthly, focused on creating a learning environment where all students, staff, and families feel welcomed and all adul ts feel capable of building genuine relationships with students, regardless of their level of need. Case Study: The presence of an Unconditional Education (UE) Coach has contributed to the use of data to develop responsive initiatives and systems that add ress the most pressing needs. One example of this occurred as part of the Culture and Climate team's follow -up to the School Climate Assessment Instrument. After reviewing student data, the team wanted to dive further to better understand student responses to specific questions: \"I feel like I can ask an adult for what I need\" and \"I feel comfortable asking for things (food, sleep, clothes) that I need\". More than half of students respond with \"I don't know/indifferent\" or \"No\" to both sets of questions. Wi th the support of the UE Coach, a child friendly survey was developed and administered to students. Once the data was collected, the team began meeting and synthesizing the data and what came out were intentional conversations about what kids need to feel safe to learn and to seek support. The UE Coach provided support and guidance in thinking about how the school addresses the issue of lack of resources amongst students without shaming them. For example, \"take what you need\" cards were discussed by the UE Coach as a strategy for kids to communicate when they are in need of resources. These take what you need cards are the first step of many to helping our students to better communicate when they are in need of resources that are difficult to access at home such as food, sleep, clothes, etc. It has been shared with the UE Coach that having cards where students can quietly ask to have needs met can be empowering for them and alleviate stigmas around asking for help. Oakland Academy of Knowledge serves an urba n community of mostly Black and Brown Children and this helps prioritize that they are set up for success, starting with helping to meet their basic needs. Sequoia Deliverable: Contractor shall provide positive behavior intervention and supports ongoing, supporting school staff in implementing the evidence -based PBIS program with fidelity to provide appropriate strengths- based responses to challenging student behaviors. Case Study: A new student joined Sequoia in October who was previously expelled from h is last two schools for high behavioral needs (i .e. destruction of property, elopement, hitting staff). After hearing about his educational and trauma history, our staff collaborated to brainstorm around support for this student so that we can create a pos itive experience at school for him to thrive. The Unconditional Education (UE) Coach met with his teacher and caregivers where we identified two goals for him to focus on. The UE Coach started a Tier 2 strategy of Check -In Check -Out (CICO) with the student so that he could build another trusting relationship with an adult on campus other than his teacher. The UE Coach then informed the office staff and school administration around strategies that are helpful when supporting this student with high anxiety an d behavioral needs to provide consistent care and response. The UE Coach also provided consultations and coaching to his teacher around strategies and interventions (giving him a transitional object from home, using a visual timer, using \"If\" and \"then\" statements, communicating his schedule for the day so things are predictable, etc.) to support this student. With the daily CICO and the consistent response from staff, this student has made monumental growth in the last few weeks by staying in class and eng aging in assignments. He now follows through with the classroom routines and transitions, can communicate his needs towards staff, and has been reaching his daily point sheet goals. His parents are grateful for the collaboration and strategies with COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES359 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGCICO an d daily communication from the UE Coach so that they can process with him at home to provide the whole child support. Think College Now Deliverable: Contractor shall support ongoing development and implementation of trauma- informed social -emotional learni ng curriculum into school -wide and classroom -based routines. Case Study: A second grade student was having frequent behavioral incidents, resulting in COST referrals, observations from the OUSD Network 2 Behavioral health department and several parent meet ings to brainstorm additional strategies to support the student in having a successful experience at school. The COST Team was experiencing challenges finding effective interventions for this student and was seeking support from numerous sources. This Unco nditional Education (UE) Coach offered to partner with the OUSD behavioral health specialist to create and restart a Tier 2 intervention plan that included Check -In, Check -Out, embedded sensory breaks and facilitated rapport building opportunities with oth er adults on campus outside of the student's classroom teacher. The goal was to provide consistent support and see if improvements could be made with a new support person. Additionally, this Unconditional Education (UE) Coach facilitated a social skills gr oup with the student and his friend group as a target to explicitly teach behavioral expectations in various settings on campus (classroom, recess, cafeteria etc.), appropriate boundary setting and conflict resolution to not only support the student but al so support capacity building for this intervention and the overall classroom culture. The UE Coach additionally worked with the teacher to strengthen and align the classroom's Tier 1 management and interventions practices with that of the school. After 1 m onth, the student showed tremendous progress based on a significant decrease in behavioral incidents and increased academic participation. The student's classroom teacher also reported that he has begun taking on a leadership role in the classroom and enjo ys helping others. The principal also made a special phone call home to the student's parents to celebrate the great progress he has made in such a short amount of time. The parents were excited and relieved to hear that their child is now able to have mos tly successful days at school. They added that since the change in plan, the student has mentioned he really enjoys going to school, resulting in them experiencing less challenges with getting him to attend school. VI. FY 21/22 Additional Information: During our \"End of Year Partner Survey,\" we asked for feedback about what impact of Seneca staff and partnerships have had on the school communities. Responses from staff at our partner programs indicate an appreciation for ongoing efforts to address staff an d family wellness and to promote connection and community during this challenging year: \"I feel like a collaborative relationship has been formed with the Seneca partnership.

This decrease reflects a reduction in partner schools, with one less school in 2022-23 than we had in FY 2021-2 2. We estimate to serve 1,470 clients in each fiscal year. VIII. FY 22/23 Programs or Service Changes: We will no longer be providing MHSA funded support at one of the CESDC/ICESDC schools, Think College Now. We are currently in assessment with our other school partners to determine which contract deliverable will be the primary focus of partnerships for the 2022-2023 school year. While the overall goals will remain to build capacity of the whole school to provide trauma-informed, inclusive, and welcoming support for CESDC/I-CESDC students and the entire student body, the specific activities may change depending on the needs of the school and student population.COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES361 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGOUTREACH / ENGAGEMENT & SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT (OESD) REPORT OESD #: OESD 34 PROVIDER NAME: STARS Behavioral Health Group PROGRAM NAME: School -Based Behavioral Health: East Oakland Pride Elementary School Program Description: MHSA Braided funding for Expansion of School -Based Behavioral Health in the Oakland Unified School District (OUSD).

Number of Unique Clients Served: 290 ACBH portion of total program budget: $96,474 How Well Did We Do? II. Please Describe Ways that the Program Strives to: a.Reduce Mental Health Stigma: Our clinicians work to integrate themselves fully into the school community and to create multiple pathways to addressing social emo tional needs. We partner closely with school staff members and provide psychoeducation to demystify mental health issues. Through the partnership and working relationships built with school staff, we have identified larger social emotional needs of the s chool community and have been able to provide classroom wide support throughout the school year for students at EOP. Our integration into the school community serves to normalize the need for mental health support and allows youth to feel comfortable acce ssing our services when in need. b.Create a Welcoming Environment: As mentioned above, we have worked to integrate ourselves into the school community, which often involves participating in school events a nd joining with families during such events. In addition, our s taff have engaged the youth in creating the therapeutic space where many of our services are offered . We have done this by placing artwork created by EOP students (with their permission) on the walls of the therapy room. We have solicited f eedback from students about setting up the office space in ways that would make them feel most comfortable . For instance, students helped with the creation of a quiet corner in the therapy room, including creating a fort to be used in the space. Clinicia ns also, set up stations throughout the therapy space for different types of activities (e.g. an art station, a group circle , a space to read ). We also ensure that the tools, books, and toys used in therapeutic work are representative of the students' cultures. III. Language Capacity for this Program: Our team at East Oakland Pride consists of 2 full time staff members and one part time staff member. Amongst the team, we have one bilingual (Spanish speaking)COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES362 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGclinician. Of the youth served, a large portion are bilingual (English/Spanish speaking) and 46 youth and/or parents served were primarily Spanish sp eaking. IV. FY 21/22 challenges: The primary challenges this school year have been COVID related as there were several instances of potential COVID exposure resulting in the need for clients and/or staff to quarantine at varying points throughout the y ear. Is anyone better off? V.FY 21/22 Client Impact: Over the course of the school year, we have been able to provide individual and group support as well as crisis management for youth at East Oakland Pride. We provided Tier 1 and Tier 2 support to the school community to improve social emotional outcomes (Direct client services and support), by offering ongoing 1:1 support to youth, providing intensive support to one of the kindergarten classes to aid in acclimating to the school environment, and connecting families to needed resources. Additionally, we have conducted several ongoing therapeutic groups including social skills group, a \"friendship group\", groups to assist with conflict resolution, debriefing support after a crisis, and a psychoeducation group around risk for students who had witnessed the suicidal behavior of a classmate. Our clinicians also offer additional support for students during unstructured time (e.g. recess and lunch) to help with the development of social skills and managing transitions. We provided support to teachers/school staff through regular staff consultations and participation in COST meetings. One of our clinicians also joined the \"culture committee\" to support efforts in fostering a positive school climate. VI. FY 21/22 Additional Information: While we are able to provide support for our Spanish speaking families with the assistance of our full-time bilingual clinician, we still lack resources to support the fairly large Mam speaking population at the school. Any resources the county is aware of to provide translation support for these families would be most helpful. VII. FY 22/23 - 25/26 Projections of Clients to be Served: Over the course of the 2021-2022 school year, we have been able to offer support schoolwide to students. We expect the same level of service provision for each fiscal year. We also hope to increase outreach to families and ideally increase engagement in a parenting support group. We estimate to serve 290 clients for each fiscal year. VIII. FY 22/23 Programs or Service Changes: We intend to continue to provide the support outlined in our contract and hope to increase our offerings of teacher trainings and opportunities for parent engagement. We have started partnering with the school administration to develop programming/workshops around suicide prevention to be rolled out in the fall during suicide prevention month.COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES363 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGOUTREACH / ENGAGEMENT & SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT (OESD) REPORT OESD #: OESD 35 PROVIDER NAME: East Bay Agency for Children (EBAC) PROGRAM NAME: Community -based Outreach & Consultation Program Description: EBAC's Fremont Healthy Start Program engages, encourages, and trains potential community responders, primarily family members of youth and children but also school staff and community members, about ways to recognize and respond to early signs of mental illness.

FY 21/22: a.Number of Unique Clients Served: per client: $49 How Well Did We Do? II. Please Describe Ways that the Program Strives to: a.Reduce Mental Health Stigma: Staff at East Bay Agency for Children's Fremont Healthy Start (FHS) program help to break the stigma around seeking mental health support by normalizing conversations about mental health and assist ing client s to increase their capacity to help themselves and others. In our interactions with clients, staff : Engage in difficult conversations about mental health topics and the importance of clients having these same conversations with their families and children . Staff normalize talking about painful experiences and emphasize that all experiences are valid, regardless of the level of intensity of those experiences. Explain the benefits of mental health services in a way that clients can understand why the servic es are being advised and how helpful they can be. Raise awareness among less privileged community members that they can have access to mental health services. Raise awareness of signs , symptoms and types of mental illnesses and coping strategies. Ensur e that clients are aware of the importance of being a support system for someone in their family who is experiencing mental health struggles, and where they can go to seek resources and help. b.Create a Welcoming Environment: EBAC's FHS p rogram offers a safe, warm and welcoming environment for clients. The office has a child and family friendly waiting area and private areas for clients and staff to meet confidentially. Although located on a school campus, the office is located at a separate portable so that th e community does not have to enter the school to access services. Clients are greeted and assisted by staff who represent the diverse cultures, languages, and immigration/refugee experiences of the clients served. Family Resource Specialists are paraprofes sional staff who live in the community; many have utilized supports for their own families in the past .COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES364 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGIII. Language Capacity for this Program: Staff are able to assist families in 10 languages: Cantonese, Farsi, Hindi, Korean, Mandarin, English. IV. FY 21/22 challenges: Despite C OVID restrictions being lifted, many clients were hesitant to meet in - person. Our staff accommodated this by interacting with these clients over the phone. For s ervices that could not be delivered virtually (for example, Parent Cafes due to technological difficulties), staff provided services at a location outside of the office ( e.g. parking lot). The lack of Dari speaking therapists and long wait lists presented a tremendous challenge for Afghan refugees who have an urgent need for counseling support. Our Afghan FRS are providing counseling to these clients while they await professional services. The long closure of in -person appointments at the A lameda County Social Services Administration office from the start of the pandemic to April 2022 was a major challenge for clients and a deterrent for accessing services. We did not have enough staff or staff hours to manage the influx of Afghan refugees seeking support and their needs. Contrasting opinions and choices regarding C OVID vaccination within families created a great deal of friction a nd damaged familial relationships. Clients often reject ed counseling services, saying they \"will get over it\". Is anyone better off? V. FY 21/22 Client Impact: Our Afghan Family Resource Specialists (FRS) used their nearly 40 years of combined experience and long -standing community partnerships to assist the influx of Afghan refugees seeking support. The FRS connected families with external as well as internal resources that offered assistance with housing, health insurance, health care, CalFresh, food, clothing, grief and loss support, and connection to immigration, legal and other services. In all, our staff had 889 encounters with Afghan refugees during the 2021 -2022 program year. Through emergency cash a ssistance funding, 50 Afghan refugees were given gift cards and checks ranging from $50 -$800 to help alleviate some of their financial burden. Our program also joined as a member of a city -wide Afghan Refugee committee, formed to support the urgent need fo r basic needs among Afghan refugees in Fremont. Our participation in this collaborative provided excellent opportunities to connect with other community -based organizations to strategize on how to best support the needs of Afghan refugees and seamlessly co nnect them to services . FHS offered a Parent Cafe workshop series focused on the five protective factors. Workshop participants reported feeling comfortable with the open discussions about parenting and grief. Parents learned the importance of making soc ial connections during difficult times and how this is key to mental health. The workshops also stressed the importance of managing stress as children can be negatively impacted by parent/caregiver anxiety. The workshops further shared information about ex ternal and internal resources available to families, such as EBAC's grief and loss support services for adults and children/youth. COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES365 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGStaff participated in monthly Motivational Interviewing (MI) workshops to strengthen and deepen their MI skills. They focused on OARS (Open ended questions, Affirmations, Reflection, Summary) and Righting Reflex training modules. This training promotes active listening skills and interviewing styles that empower clients to be self -reflective of their behavior. Using this proces s leads to sustained changes in their lives that will be very powerful and beneficial. VI.FY 21/22 Additional Information: Below is a summary of lessons learned throughout the year: Cultural beliefs and customs greatly influence a client's decision to access mental health services. Although we inform them of the benefits of counseling, strong cultural beliefs against counseling usually prevail. Despite this, having these conversations opens the door to this taboo topic and encourages at minimum a consideration about using mental health resources. Explaining benefits of counseling in a way that clients can understand is extremely important. We found that using terms such as \"getting it off your chest\", \"sharing your burden,\" and \"venting with a trained specialist\" are more effective when suggesting counseling than saying \"I would like for you to look for counseling\". Our experience has shown that being too directive with clients creates a fear reaction and lacks an explanation as to why counseling is bein g advised. Modeling healthy boundaries is a must when working with vulnerable populations. This is important because participants who understand and identify their own priorities and boundaries are better able to advocate for themselves. We have found that when staff are clear on realistic expectations and limits, the process of working with families is smoother. Maintaining active collaboration with our partners is even more paramount now in order to best serve the newcomer refugee population. Our staff participate in many meetings to stay abreast of service implementation and/or changes. The time and effort that must be given to the refugee population is extremely intensive and challenging. It is extremely important to be aware of all of the community resources available to best serve this population. VII.

FERC is operated by the Mental Health Association of Alameda County (MHAAC).

FY 21/22: a.Number of Unique Clients Served: 2,120 Cost per client: $866 How Well Did We Do? II. Please Describe Ways that the Program Strives to: a.Reduce Mental Health Stigma: Reducing mental health stigma is foundational to all aspects of FERC's program design: FERC employs staff with lived experience as caregivers of loved ones living with mental health illness and conditions. Throughout the fiscal year the program adhered to this precept: FERC staff are caregivers and all program volunteers were caregivers and sometimes consumers. Family Advocates a re trained and supported to speak openly about their lived experience. FERC finds that the model of staff openly sharing their stories about mental health caregiving creates a stigma -free, safe space in which Family Members can share openly about their experiences, identify needs , receive resources, learn about mental health and self-care for the caregiver . This safe space is also provided through 9 discrete monthly peer -based support groups (90 groups in total) in which Family Members can learn to spe ak openly about the challenges they face and receive validation from their peers who share similar experiences. FERC support groups build community and strengthen support n etworks and allow families to develop leadership skills as they become resources for one another. FERC provides culturally syntonic supports for Spanish speaking families; the Oakland and Fremont sites are safe places where bi -lingual /bi-cultural advocates provide support that is sensitive to the stigma that caregivers encounter within and without the family. FERC provided 16 Caf\u00e9 Para Padres (Parent Cafes) for Spanish speaking families throughout the year and built this community support through leadership development of Family Member volunteers who provide the cafes i n collaboration with FERC . Families report finding a safe - haven free of stigma in which they can openly share their experiences and support one another.COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES367 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGFERC's Bingo Fridays is a fun weekly social gathering for caregivers and their loved ones where family fun time is shared in a group setting. In this environment (currently virtual) the behavior of loved ones is not judged, and families are relieved of the social anxiety they often experience in group settings due to mental health stigma. The program provide d CIT training for 205 police officers throughout the year: this training is pivotal to reducing the mental health stigma existent within police departments. The powerful stories presented by family members and mental health consumers provide d the officers with expanded perspectives and understanding. The goal is to shift officer responses from stigma -based assumptions to compassionate understanding for those living with serious mental health illness and their families . In FY 2020 -21, in response to the death of George Floyd and the ongoing institutionalized racism dominating our society, FERC Outreach developed an Annual REACH event called: Recognize, Expres s, Acknowledge through Community Healing . In FY 2021 -22 the Annual REACH event focused on the Afghan Community in Alameda County. Afghan Presenters spoke about trauma, mental health stigma , shared insight into rich cultural history and customs and presented updates on current challenges the Alameda County Afghan Community is facing. b.Create a Welcoming Environment: To experience a welcoming environment, FERC strives to provide Family Members with the opportunity to see themselves reflected in the FERC environment. In FY 21/22, o ur FERC team represent ed the African American community, the Latinx community, the Asian community , the Middle Eastern community and the LGBTQIA+ community. Our staff had age diversity ranging from TAY youth to Older Adults and we had gender diversity. The team also ha d diversity in abilities and in Family Memb er and Consumer lived experience. Since programming was provided virtually throughout most of the year due to COVID -19, we focused on provid ing welco ming virtual environments for clients and the community. Our Zoom environments were culturally syntonic virtual spaces where caregivers could come for support , resources, learning and social connection. Some of the FY 21 -22 strategies FERC adopted in our virtual programming were: Client support groups and client meetings begin with a brief relaxation practic e and Family Members are invit ed to set their intentions for their time together . Virtual meetings and programming often close with a mindfulness grounding exercise. FERC f acilitators i nclud e a self -care component in the service design for each virtual gathering . Using humor and compassion when technological glitches and challenges are navigated In zoom, real- time . In partnership with OFE, FERC increased online programming for Spanish -only sp eaking families and found that our virtual programming resulted in families saying they felt more connected , less isolated and that these environments , in which only Spanish was spoken , were freeing , facilitated learning and resource sharing and met our clients' needs for feeling connected to community in COVID . We provided snacks and beverages (that we would normally have for clients attending in person programming) with $5 e-gift cards to Starbucks . Although these \"snacks\" were provided in arrears ( to attendees), we felt that this incentive recognized the cross -cultural value of food as an important social connector . We created colorful activity flyers for events and created zoom backdrops with flyer graphics to create a positive virtual environment.COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES368 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGWe used ice breakers sometimes with break out rooms and more often as a large group to relax and connect participants with one another. We used an online raffle game for event raffle prizes . We used our Weekly Bi ngo Friday event as a conduit for clients to meet our staff : the task of hosting this activity rotated across our Famil y Advocate s, Outreach Coordinator, and management staff. Families relax ed together having fun playing old fashioned , cage rolling , personalized re-usable -bingo -card Bingo games. III. Language Capacity for this Program: Throughout the year our staff was 37% bilingual bicultural Spanish/English and held the following positions: primary FY 21/22 challenge was in staffing. Although there was no change in leadership staff across the year, the program struggled with the attrition and replac ement of Family Advocates. FERC started the fiscal year at 67% staffed which lasted through quarter 2. In quarter 3, the program finally became 100% staffed , however, we ended quarter 4 staffed at 89% . Family advocates left the program for a variety of reasons including : family caregiving needs, starting a higher education program, parenting needs, deci sion to work directly with mental health consumers . Throughout the year, t he agency and program continually assessed hiring practices . The Executive Director created a bi weekly hiring team meeting for all hiring managers and hiring support staff across the agency . This meeting was helpful and resulted in an ongoing practice of hiring funnel review and responsive brainstorming and adjusting which has improved our applicant to onboarding timeline. It is anticipated that in the new fiscal year, our hiring pr ocesses will continue to streamline. The second challenge that the program experienced throughout the year was the lengthly Family Advocate training period from first day on the job to first day in direct client service. We attributed some extension of training time to the nature of remote work , however, by the end of the fiscal year, it became evident that the 4 - 5 month training period was also a result of curriculum design. The FERC Family Advocate training curriculum will be redesigned in Q1 of FY 22/23 and it is anticipated that trainees will complete their training in 2 months, begin modified direct client service in the second month aned will begin direct client service in the thi rd month of employment. Is anyone better off? V. FY 21/22 Client Impact: The Program provided 14,7 60 hours of programming and achieved 564 outreach contacts in the fiscal year. The program met th e contract deliverable to make at least 400 follow -up contacts to these sources , which resulted in 6 collaborative projects: 10/28/21 Fremont FRC Day Away Event Planning Committee and event hosting; 11/16/21 FERC Annual Virtual Resource Fair with 5 Community PEERS; UCFC; Seneca; IHOT/AOT; Roots: PIWI ; Mental Health Outreach Event ; 5/7/22 CSS Healing Hearts Suicide Prevention Outreach Event; 5/14/22 FERC & First Presbyterian Berkeley Mental Health Symposium ; 6/17/22 FERC Annual R.E.A.C.H.

COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES369 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGOur contact requires the program to establish five resource displays for family members in the five Alameda County threshold languages . This deliverable was met in FY 21 - 22 wit h the FERC website that translates all content into a selection of languages including all county threshold languages. The program provided 54 virtual peer and social support groups throughout the year : 30 Bingo Friday group events ; 16 Caf\u00e9 Para Padres Parent Caf\u00e9 groups . FERC responded to 1,014 new Warmline contacts this year , exceeding our require ment of 900 new contacts . The Warmline was operated M - F 10:00 AM - 6:00 PM . The FERC Warmline Coordinator is bilingual English/Spanish. The program provided Family Coaching and Leadership Development to 8 volunteers in the year. 4 Spanish Speaking volunteers were developed by FERC staff , in partnership with OFE. The subject area specific to these volunteers was : Mental Health and the Five Protective F actors for Family Resilience. These volunteers hosted the 16 Caf\u00e9 Para Padres events in the year. The program recruited 3 TAY volunteers to provide outreach support throughout the year. These volunteers supported preparing for the program outreach events and supported the Warmline Coordinator by completing a resource Updating project to assure that all resource information listed in the MHAAC Resource Library is current . The program continued to coach the peer volunteer for the FERC Friday Bingo group to support her in developing her skills for the work environment. FERC Family Advocates and the Outreach Coordinator provided 983 AB 1424 consultations/educations in the fiscal year. All new clients were provided with this consultation and consultations were provided by FERC during 5 AAFOP workshop presentations throughout the year. The program held 9 virtual monthly support groups throughout the year (covering all four regions of the county) for a total of 90 support groups. Two of these monthly support gro ups were in Spanish. The program also provided two Family to Family Sessions (8 mental health education classes for Family Member per series) for the community. Throughout the fiscal year the program provid ed 8 provider education trainings to community partners including: ACBH Children and Young Adult System of Care; San Lorenzo Unified School District (2 presentations); Youth and Family Services; Ohlone ACBH EPSDT. Due to the need for providing these trainings on zoom, the FERC leadership team felt that a day long training was not a feasible format for this comprehensive training . The program adjusted and provide d 2 - 4 hour trainings in these topic areas for community partners. These trainings did not offer Continuing Education Units (CEUs). In FY 21 -22 FERC provided training for the Crisis Intervention Trainings (CIT) with the Oakland Police Department that resulted in an average of 90% of officers reporting \"strongly agree\" or \"agree\" on the CIT training evaluation to the statement s: \"I expect to use some of the information learned today \" and \"This information will improve my effectiveness in interacting with consumers and family members\" . An average of 97% of officers reported \"High Satisfaction or Satisfaction\" with the FERC CIT training. Officers did not prefer the zoom training format however, they were attentive and participated in group exercises and training activities.

FY 21/22: a.Number of Unique Clients Served : 47 clients served. Cost per client: $4,787 How Well Did We Do? II. Please Describe Ways that the Program Strives to: a.Reduce Mental Health Stigma: RTT st aff are expected to u se trauma- informed care practices with all clients - i.e., the approach to working with clients is not \"what's wrong with you?\" but rather \"what happened to you?\" - as well as motivational interviewing interventions - i.e., work collaboratively with individuals to achieve their goals by creating an atmosphere of acceptance and compassion. b.Create a Welcoming Environment: RTT s taff are encouraged and expected to demonstrate an awareness of and sensitivity to clients, including cultural and ethical beliefs. Additionally, staff are to implement care in a thorough, skillful, consistent , and continuous manner. La Familia's values are discussed when staff are hired, and touched upon continuously throughout the work, e.g., in team meetings, in one -on-one meetings, etc. Values discussed include belonging ( help ing those around us feel important, connected, and con fiden t in a community of hope; t his sense of belonging is rooted in compassion and respect for shared cultures , values, and lived experiences) and social justice ( amplify ing the voices of our community to fight for systems, policies, opportunities, and services that promote social and economic justice and improve the quality of life for all ). III. Language Capacity for this Program: RTT served 47 clients in English. IV. FY 21/22 challenges: RTT funding for FY21 -22 was cut significantly ($86,000) from the previous fiscal year/FY20 -21. This decrease limited RTT staff ability to help clients with thei r basic needs, housing, etc. Additionally, with a more limited support service s budget, we have not been able to offer as manyCOMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES377 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGmilestone incentives to keep clients e ngaged in the treatment program (due to prioritizing the funds we do have for client's basic needs). The most prominent and ongoing challenge RTT faced during FY21 -22 w as related to staffing. RTT operated throughout the entirety of the fiscal year with only one part -time peer counselor (we are contracted for two full- time peer counselor s). RTT leadership worked with La Familia HR to recruit, hire, and retain new staff, b ut faced ongoing challenges. During FY21 -22, RTT ma de offers/commenced employment to/with five different individuals to fill the peer counselor role - two individuals lasted almost a month, one individual lasted one day, and two individuals never made it t o onboarding. There was a variety of reasons as to why these hirings did not pan out - each specific to that particular individual/hire. Being short -staffed over the course of the year meant that we were limited in the number of clients we could open at an y one time, and in the number of overall service hours we could provide. The one peer counselor for RTT worked incredibly hard and was able to meet the needs of the clients on the RTT caseload (and she nearly always exceeded her monthly productivity target s). However, we were not able to serve as many people as we could have if we were fully staffed . It is common for RTT clients to present with dual diagnosis/SUD challenges. RTT staff support these clients in their efforts to enroll in SUD treatment - often after significant time is spent processing a nd motivating the client to consider SUD treatment. However, there appears to be an ongoing lack of beds/open spaces for residential SUD trea tment (for those who do qualify ). A typical experience for RTT staff is as follows: staff work with a client for some time, they utilize Motivational Interviewing techniques around the client's use and overall functioning, and finally get the client agree to engage in SUD treatment. However, when RTT staff and the client ca ll the Substance Use Access and Referral Helpline, they are told that there are no openings for SUD treatment in the county and that the client needs to call back. When clients are not put on a waitlist (and are expected to keep calling back regarding trea tment), they often lose the motivation, continue using, and it becomes much harder to treat their MH symptoms and improve their overall functioning. Unfortunately, RTT clients do occasionally recidivate and end up incarcerated after they have commenced tr eatment. When this happens, clients may be incarcerated for a few days to a few weeks (and RTT will hold their spot for them, so long as it is not a prolonged incarceration - i.e., 90 days or less). During this challenging time, clients appear to rely on t he supportive relationships that they have built with RTT staff. Clients will ask RTT staff to meet via video/phone, or to be present for their court dates. RTT staff are not permitted to bill time for clients who are in a locked setting. Therefore, staff do not get credit towards their productivity goals when they interact with and support incarcerated clients (example: RTT clinician drove to Oakland and spent several hours in court supporting an incarcerated client during his court date and was not able t o attribute any of that time spent with the client to her monthly total). Of note, at the end of the fiscal year, ACBH began permitting RTT staff to get reimbursed for payments towards video visits while clients were in Santa Rita. This was helpful and gre atly appreciated by RTT leadership and staff. The COVID -19 pandemic safety measures continued to pose some challenges to program implementation (though much less so as compared to the previous fiscal year). All RTT staff we re vaccinated throughout the FY 21-22. Vaccination helped, but client illness continued to create limitations surrounding in -person interactions. The decrease of in -person interactions led to some challenges in rapport building and sustaining client engagement . COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES378 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGIs anyone better off? V.FY21/22 Client Impact: RTT is a voluntary program, and while individuals referred to the treatment program may be prompted to do so at the recommendation of Probation or the Court, getting clients to engage is often the first challenge that staff will enc ounter. In the past fiscal year, once clients showed up for their initial intake, RTT staff were successful in engaging clients initially in treatment - in fact, over 90% of new RTT clients had two or more treatment sessions withi n the first 30 days . The great majori ty of RTT clients come into treatment with significant challenges related to housing and/or employment. For RTT staff, addressing housing needs is often the starting point. Employment challenges are also important to address in treatment, as em ployment is often required before the clients can obtain housing. In FY21 -22, 83% of RTT clients were successfully linked to community -based support services to address their housing and/or employment needs. Case study - a 20 year old Mexican and Cuban Am erican male was referred to RTT by the Alameda County Public Defender's office. The client reported experiencing feelings of anxiety and depression that had become much more pronounced due to his pending criminal case. He reported that his low mood, anxiet y, lack of motivation, and feelings of hopelessness impaired his ability focus on applying for work and school. He was unemployed, not in school, and reported strained relationships with family members. The client disclosed feelings of deep shame related t o his charge (sexual contact with an animal). The client expressed fear that he would be judged by RTT staff - and others - due to the nature of his charge. As treatment progressed, the client began to open up and he reported a history of childhood sexual abuse to his RTT clinician, the first time he had spoken about the abuse. As the client began to be more open during therapy, he also became more engaged during case management sessions. The client asked RTT staff to be present at his court dates for supp ort - RTT staff attended and reported that the client was subject to judgment and mistreatment during at least one court date (due to the nature of his charge), but the client continued to express appreciation for RTT staff supporting him and continuing to show up for him. The client began to work more diligently with his RTT Peer Counselor to complete an application and FAFSA for Lake Merritt College. The client ultimately enrolled in general education classes and is now working on picking an area of conce ntration. RTT staff also supported the client with resume building, job leads, and interview preparation and follow up. The client was able to obtain -and-retain a warehouse job. The client also entered into a healthy relationship with a girlfriend and repo rted improved relationships with his mother and sisters. The client recently successfully graduated from Diversion Court and asked RTT staff to be present for the court date, as well as a celebratory lunch. VI. FY 21/22 Additional Information: Housing continues to be the primary and most urgent case management need for clients. RTT staff continue to work hard to link clients to any -and-all resources, but if we were able to help financially as well (e.g., with a deposit and first months' rent to get clie nts going, etc.), that would be significant. The times when we have been able to get clients connected to housing quickly are when we see faster and more sustained success - such as when were able to connect clients to Prop 47 housing funds. Our current su pport services budget allows us to support clients with approximately $100 (for all basic needs), and does not afford us the capability to help more directly with housing. Also, about half way through the fiscal year, we got word that the program that help ed link our clients to Prop 47 housing funds had hit the limit and could no longer take on new referrals. This further limited our ability to support clients with their most urgent need.COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES379 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGMost of our clients appear to do well at the RTT level of care (i.e ., weekly and as needed individual therapy and weekly and as needed case management -> approximately two services per week for 12 -18 months). However, there are a number of clients who end up requiring more support when compared to a more typical RTT client. These clients may have periods of stability, but these periods tend to be the exception rather than the rule. Over the course of the 18 months, these clients frequently present in crisis and may require three or four services per week (or even daily che ck-ins with RTT staff) in order to avoid hospitalization. RTT staff have reported efforts to connect these individuals to a higher level of care, such as FSP or intensive case management (Level 1), but are often met with challenges in doing so. When staff try to refer these clients to a more appropriate level of care, they are told that since the clients do not have a history of hospitalizations, they are not eligible for a higher level of care. At that point, it would be inappropriate to refer the client e lsewhere, so they stay in our program. While staying in our program is ultimately the thing that (hopefully) helps them to maintain some stability and avoid DTS/DTO, it is much harder for our staff to manage their caseloads, as the program is not designed for that level of contact given the number of clients our clinician is supporting at any one time. Additionally, it ultimately becomes a problem once the client reaches the maximum of 18 months as they would still be deemed ineligible for a FSP or Level 1, and would very likely decompensate if referred to OP treatment services. Related to the point above, RTT clients can present as very high need; we have one FTE clinician who often ends up being stretched thin to meet the significant demands of clients. If we were able to have two FTE clinicians - to go with our two FTE peer counselors - we would be better equipped to serve our clients while avoiding staff burn out and turnover. VII.Projections of Clients to be Served: As of July 2022, we are finally fully staffed - for the coming fiscal year, we hope to remain fully staffed and to subsequently be able to increase our caseload to maintain an average of 40 clients for each fiscal year 22/23 - 25/26. VIII. FY 22/23 Programs or Service Changes: We have recently modified our policy around no-shows for intakes. Due to the high demand for services for our target population, RTT has been experiencing a larger than usual influx of referrals and subsequent longer than usual callback list. We want to ensure that we are moving through the list as quickly as possible. It is vital that we connect with and engage individuals soon after the referral, before the window of possibility for treatment closes. Therefore, if an individual does not show up (or call) for an intake appointment, they will be automatically moved to the bottom of the callback list (rather than rescheduling and prolonging the outreach/enrollment process). It is a challenging balance, because we do want to give each individual an opportunity to engage in services but we also do not want to lose time waiting for someone who may never engage. We are hoping to come up with a plan to better meet the needs of individuals released from Santa Rita Jail without a phone/contact information. We are considering options such as exploring ways to better connect with referrals while they are still incarcerated (i.e., we've made a request to get info from ACBH and the SRJ discharge team regarding how staff can connect with referrals via phone). We've also better prepared our front desk staff (with a document that has directions on how to get a free phone from the Social Services office) for any clients that come to La Familia RTT from Santa Rita and don't have a phone/phone number .

Please Describe Ways that the Program Strives to: a.Reduce Mental Health Stigma: BayLegal engages in staff and community education to reduce mental health stigma. Staff are trained in Harm Reduction and Trauma -Informed L awyering and provide client -centered services to help normalize treatment and reduce mental health stigma for clients. Staff provides trainings regarding mental health and other disability issues to the National Organization of Social Security Claimants' Representatives, Practicing Law Institute, BHCS and primary care providers, and Covenant House. b.Create a Welcoming Environment: BayLegal strives to create a welcoming and inclusive environment for all clients. BayLegal attorneys are trained to provide cli ents with respectful, culturally and linguistically competent services that help clients identify their goals and the steps needed to achieve those goals. Written materials are reviewed regularly for readability and attorneys provide reasonable accommodat ions for clients with disabilities. Clients in this program meet with attorneys one -on-one and are offered water, a snack, and toiletries if needed. Staff eliminate s barriers to service by conducting meetings in clients' primary language, meeting with clients in their preferred location or by phone, and following -up with clients who miss meetings. III.

USPS delays in processing mail particularly affected homeless clients who use General Delivery and made obtaining necessary signatures more difficult. Clients sometimes do not have a stable address, move inCOMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES381 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGand out of Santa Rita Jail or medical facilities, and experience periods of homelessness. All of these issues slowed services and delayed communications between staff and c lients. The SSA field offices continued to be understaffed and were generally closed to the public except for limited appointments, and hearings were held virtually. Additionally, Social Security experienced technical problems with their phone lines, making it more difficult to conduct business with SSA by phone. BayLegal worked with clients to ensure they could attend virtual hearings and brought clients into the Oakland office as needed to attend hearings in special conference rooms retrofitted to c omply with all safety protocols. Is anyone better off? V. FY 21/22 Client Impact: BayLegal served 294 clients 319 cases in FY 21/22. BayLegal closed 133 cases: 10 cases assisted clients with advice and counsel, 37 cases assisted clients with brief s ervices, and 86 cases assisted clients with extended services. Of extended service cases, 58 cases assisted clients with Administrative Agency Decisions, 3 cases assisted clients with court decisions, 21 cases assisted clients with extensive services not resulting in settlement or court or administrative action, and 4 cases assisted clients with other extended representation. Monetary benefits for clients from back awards and lump- sum settlements, reductions or eliminations of claimed amounts, cost saving s, and benefits totaled $773,544. BayLegal's ACBH contract, Section IV Contract Deliverables and Requirements sets the following Impact Objective: Contractor shall achieve a SSI/SSDI allowance rate at least equal to that of the national average approval rate. In the SSI Annual Statistical Report, 2 020, the national 2019 allowance rate was 46.6%.1 BayLegal's FY 21/22 allowance rate for closed cases was 79%. BayLegal successfully accomplished this goal. The client story below illustrates the work funded by this grant: Kemi B.* was incorrectly deni ed SSDI benefits in 2014 and came to BayLegal for help. Kemi's BayLegal attorney helped her reapply for benefits. When the reapplication was denied, BayLegal represented Kemi at the reconsideration and administrative hearings, and then at the Appeals Cou ncil and federal court. Kemi won a favorable court decision to remand for a new hearing, where BayLegal again represented her. Kemi then won a favorable decision at the new hearing that backdated her award to the original alleged disability onset date am ounting to nearly $150,000 and ongoing payments. Kemi is now more stable and financially secure with SSDI benefits. *Client name changed to protect confidentiality. VI. FY 21/22 Additional Information: Cases with the Social Security Administration (SSA) and the California Disability Determination Services (DDS) are generally moving more slowly due to the ongoing pandemic. SSA and DDS are both understaffed and SSA field offices are generally closed to the public. Technical problems with SSA phone lines made conducting business by phone more difficult. Cases with DDS are sometimes stalled awaiting a consultative examination that DDS staff has been unable to schedule due to the lack of in -person appointments, or client or clinician objections to an in -person appointment. 1This is the latest national allowance rate published directly by the Social Security Administration. https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/statcomps/ssi_asr/2020/ssi_asr20.pdf .COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES382 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGDespite these challenges, BayLegal continued to advocate for its clients. In part with BayLegal's advocacy, SSA established \"vulnerable population liaisons\" in field offices to help facilitate applications and address barriers to proce ssing claims, appeals, appointment of representative, and other forms as part of SSA's COVID workgroup. SSA rolled out a new online tool that makes it easier to establish a protective filing date or application lead similar to California's GetCalFresh.org tool. BayLegal hopes that these changes will increase service access for its clients and result in more benefit awards. VII.FY 22/23 - 25/26 Projections of Clients to be Served: BayLegal estimates the number of clients to be served to be approximately 300 for each fiscal yea r. Clients will be represented at all stages of SSI/SSDI applications, and staff will advocate for clients with SSA and DDS. VIII. FY 22/23 Programs or Service Changes: Due to the ongoing pandemic, staff provided remote services whenever possible. The Oakland office was open during the reporting period on a limited basis for walk-in clients. The SSI/SSDI advocacy project is supported by a remote attorney of the week who calls back clients looking for assistance. The attorney of the week screens for eligibility and merit, provides advice or brief service as needed, and adds clients to the referral list for representation. As the Oakland office opens to the public, BayLegal will resume an attorney of the day model to serve clients who walk into the office seeking assistance with SSI/SSDI benefits.COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES383 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGOUTREACH / ENGAGEMENT & SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT (OESD) REPORT OESD #: OESD 38 PROVIDER NAME: Alameda County Homeless Action Center (HAC) PROGRAM NAME: Alameda County Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) Program Advocacy Services Project Program Description: HAC Provides SSI/SSDI advocacy to increase the number of Alameda County residents facing moderate to severe mental health issues who are approved for SSI/SSDI benefits.

Please Describe Ways that the Program Strives to: a.Reduce Mental Health Stigma: Our clients overwhelmingly have some history of mental health diagnosis and/or treatmen t, and it is our job to encourage them to work with u s to document the extent to which those concerns have impacted their lives . That task, usually over the course of several years, is at the heart of representing people in Social Security disability claims. HAC 's collective understanding of some of the common threads running through the lives of individuals who are poor and mentally ill in Alameda County makes it a place that the range of experiences, we hope, can be shared with significantly less fear of judgment or discomfort than people expect in othe r settings . In addition to what staff gain from direct experience with the work, they receive training from a variety of internal and external sources to help them effectively and respectfully work with clients with mental illness : From trauma -informed la wyering, harm reduction, de -escalation, to tolerance, acceptance, and forgiveness. HAC believes that mental health and mental illness exist on a continuum. Location on that continuum varies over time both within and across individuals and families and communities. You are welcome at HAC, even if you sometimes have days where your symptoms prevent the business at hand for you and your attorney. We'll meet you where yo u are, repeatedly. b.Create a Welcoming Environment: HAC extend s a welcoming hand beyond the walls of our office into the community where possible. Our Outreach Team may make initial - or repeated - contact with clients during encampment visits or at clinics where we offer help with public benefits, identification, and referrals , or donations of tents, socks , or snacks . Acknowledging our clients ' needs for things beyond representation in their disability claim is part of our strategy of engagement . While some clients really only need help with SSI, the majority have a variety of other concerns related to health or income or housing or food at some point during their relationship with HAC . To keep clients engaged and in touch during what is frequently a multi -yearCOMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) PROGRAM SUMMARIES384 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGrelationship while we wait for action from Social Security and appeal unfavorable decisions , we need to some extent to be a place people think of when they need some more immediate help. The pandemic reduced our ability to provide drop -in services within the walls of our office, but enhanced our efforts to provide these services in other ways. Notable beside our outreach team is our helpline, staffed by a rotating crew of our SSI attorneys and advocates who are trained and supported to provid e remote help with the same sorts of benefits and housing concerns that peopl e bring to our offices. If you do come to our office, if you are thirsty, hungry, or want to pet a dog or even a cat for a bit, or just need a mask or some hand sanitizer , you'll usually be in luck. III. Language Capacity is augmented by use of Language Line whenever necessary. It has over 240 languages available. IV. FY 21/22 challenges: Social Security continued to be much harder to reach than in pre -pandemic years, extending the length of decisions at each stage of the application process by several months on average - a 20 - 25% inccrease in the time from filing to decision s and opening to closing of cases over prepandemic years. By the spring of 2022 we were tracking the number of our calls to SSA that simply wouldn't complete at all. Some weeks it was more than 50% , and wait times for the calls that did complete were much longer, stretching each attorney thin as they tried to carry a full caseload with routine transactions in each case taking more time than usual. Is anyone better off? V.FY 21/22 Client Impact: 59 cases were closed with an award of benefits during the FY. VI. FY 21/22 Additional Information: N/A VII. Projections of Clients to be Served: SSA Processing times, while still worse than in pre-pandemic years, did see some improvement in 2022, and at this writing, Social Security has finally opened their doors for some in person services. If things continue to return to normal, we hope to be able to process cases faster - when cases turn over faster, we can serve more clients in a year. We hope to at least get back above 400 in the FY 22/23 - 25/26, including the 233 cases that were still pending as of the end of this FY 22/23. VIII.

PEI services emphasize the de velopment, implementation, and promotion of strategies that are non-stigmatizing and non-discrimina tory.1 PEI programs create partnerships with unserved and underserved ethnic and linguistically isolated communities, schools, the justice system, primary care and a wide range of social, wellness, cultural and spiritual support services and community groups. Services are centrally located where people receive and participate in routine health care, wellness, leisure, educational, recreational, faith, and spiritual healing . PEI Plan Requirements : The PEI Community Planning Process requires local stakeholders to recognize the following parameters for this funding stream: All ages must be served and at least 51% of the funds must serve children and youth ages 0 - 25 years; Disparities in access to services for underserved ethnic communities must be addressed; All regions of the county must have access to services; Early intervention should generally be low -intensity and short duratio n; Early intervention may be somewhat higher in intensity and longer in duration for individuals experiencing first onset of psychosis associated with serious mental illness. Service Requirements : Individuals at risk of or indicating early signs of mental illness or emotional disturbance and links them to treatment and other resources. 2 PEI strategies & Approaches: Outreach to families, employers, primary care health providers, and others to recognize the early signs of potentially severe and disabling mental illness. The goal is to catch mental health issues in their earliest stages to prevent long -term suffering. Access and linkage to medically necessary care...as early in the onset of these conditions Redu ction in stigma and discrimination associated with either being diagnosed with a mental health condition or seeking mental health services (MHSA, Section 4, Welfare and Institutions Code (WIC) \u00a7 5840(b).

It was the first time the entire PEI system implemented a similar survey tool across all programs simultaneously . The optional survey was ope n to all U nderserved Ethnic and Language Program (UELP)2 participants who had received four or more services (including preventive counseling, community events, workshops, support groups , and prevention visits) from January 1 to March 31, 2022 , and to all PEI program partic ipant s who received services between February 15th and March 15th, 2022 . The PEI Participant Satisfaction Survey was implemented primarily in electronic format for ease of access and completion. Participants received assistanc e, by request , in person and by phone to complete paper surveys. Some providers allowed time near the conclusion of various virtual programming and events to facilitate survey completion via a link shared in the chat function. PEI contracted providers co llaborated with ACBH to design the survey and the implementation process. The design team held inclusiveness as a core value for example, advising that t he survey , formerly named \"Client Satisfaction \" be re-titled \"Participant Satisfaction \". Some program participants don't consider themselves clients and prefer not to be referred to by that designation . Further, the survey is brief with simple language. Finally, ACBH coordinated with providers t o translate the survey into the various languages representing the diverse communities that receive PEI services: Chinese, Korean, Farsi, Dari, Pashto, Tigrinya, Amharic, French, Fijian, Tongan, Urdu, Hindi, and Punjabi. Providers collected 1,342 surveys during the assessment period from 752 PEI program participants and from 590 UELP program participants. In the post -assessment review, providers requested edits to descriptions of some race/ethnicity categories. They also recommended extend ing the data collection period for up to six months to increase participation . 2 UELP is a subgroup within the PEI portfolio with a specific evidence/community -based, community informed model and program requirements around fidelity. Due to UELP's programmatic and service delivery standardization and evaluation processes, these programs implemented a longer survey. The results are listed separately.

Some clients shared they did not have the bandwidth to focus on substance use issues due to competing priorities as such adjusting to parenthood coupled with the Covid -19 pandemic. Due to the limited number of referrals, we did not conduct an 8 -week substance use/ har m reduction group for current MPCAH participants. To mitigate this challenge, substance use harm reduction sessions were merged into existing groups for pregnant and parenting clients.

This section references the 20 20/202 1 evaluation . Information regarding the 21/22 Participant Satisfaction Survey is in the Program Outcomes & Impact Section. The health assessment and satisfaction surveys were disseminated to the UELP community in 23 different languages including English, Spanish, Vietnamese, Chinese, Dari, Hindi, Khmer, Nepali, Korean, Thai, and Burmese and covered the following outcomes: Forming and strengthening identity; Changing knowledge and perception of mental health; Building community and wellness; Connecting individual and family with their culture; Improving access to services and resources; Transforming mental health services . All UELP providers offer services in two main categories: 1) Prevention services, for clients who are at h igher than average risk of developing a significant mental illness and 2) Preventive Counseling (PC) services, designed for clients who are showing early signs and symptoms of a mental health concern. Responses to the client satisfaction survey were analyz ed separately for Prevention and PC services to measure any differences between the two types of services. The health assessment is only given to PC clients. The evaluation used mixed methods. To better understand the meaning of survey responses, ACBH also conducted focus group s with the UELP program participants . KEY FINDINGS The client satisfaction survey and focus groups were used to assess the program outcomes. The critical findings of the analysis are summarized below. During fiscal year 2020 -2021, a total of 668 respondents from all 13 of the UELP programs completed the survey. In FY 20/21 , the data shows that UELP providers in total produced: 9,135 Prevention events, which is a 22% increase from last year and a 15% increase over pre -pandemic FY 18/19. 70,239 people were served at these Prevention events (duplicated count); and 1,174 unique clients were served through PC services, which is an 8% increase in t he number of clients served in FY 19/20. PREVENTION & EARLY INTERVENTION (PEI) PROGRAM SUMMARIES402 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG In FY 20/21, both assessment tools assessed the impact of the three core strategies (Outreach and Engagement; Mental Health Consultation ; and Early Intervention services) across the following outcomes : Forming and Strengthening Identity Prevention services enhance self -efficacy . Ninety -two percent of Prevention and eighty -four percent of PC respondents reported feeling better about themselves. Changing Individual Knowledge and Perception of Mental Health Services Providers are working towards changing the perception and narrative around mental health. Ninety - three percent of Prevention respondents and eighty -nine percent of PC respondents reported having a stronger belief that most people with mental healt h experiences can grow, change, and recover. Having these discussions more frequently and openly work s towards normalizing mental health and reducing the stigma associated with it. Building Community and Its Wellness UELP providers are working towards a h ealthier community for their clients. Respondents reported establishing relationships because of their participation in services. UELP programs help clients build and reduce the risk of social isolation. Ninety -four percent of Prevention respondents and eighty -six percent of PC respondents reported that they have people with whom they can do enjoyable things. Connecting Individual and Family with Their Culture UELP programs provide clients with opportuni ties to connect with their cultur e. Focus group/interview respondents reported that they had improved their parenting skills and learned how to parent in America. Ninety -four percent of Prevention respondents and eighty- five percent of PC respondents reported feeling more connected to the ir culture and community. Due to the COVID -19 pandemic activities have moved to online spaces, Focus Group participants said that this makes it easier for them to participate in the programs . However, there was a decrease in the mention of participants connecting to their culture during the Focus Groups this year. Improving Access to Services and Resources UELP programs strive to improve access to services and resources for their client populations. Respondents reported several examples in which their program has connected them to resources such as employment, housing, food, and financial services. Ninety perce nt of Prevention respondents and eighty -two percent of PC respondents report ed becoming more effective in getting the resources that they or their family need.

Ninety -nine percent of Prevention and PC respondents reported that program staff treated them with dignity and respect. Additionally, staff were said to be among the most beneficial parts of the program in the open -ended responses. This is reflected in the high percentage of Prevention (97%) and PC (96%) respondents agreeing that they would recommend this program to a friend or family member. Despite largely pro viding online services since March of 2020, the UELP agencies are still able to provide a welcoming and inviting atmosphere that is safe for clients. ADDITIONAL FINDINGS Overall, respondents reported improved quality of life because of their participation in their programs, but still reported a need for continued support. PC respondents are also benefitting from more intensive services from their UELP providers. More than half (7 2%) of PC respondents reported fewer crises, which is a large increase compared to last year (57%). Focus group respondents suggested that participation might be more sustainable if the groups continued online . They find it more convenient because they do not have to find transportation or take more time out of their day . When asked what they would like to see more of on the client satisfaction survey respondents wanted more help with mental health and f ocus group respondents mentioned that they wanted youth programming to help them with their mental health . EVALUATION LIMITATIONS Although this annual evaluation data continues to show positive results, it has several limitations in our assessment methods, including the small sample size, the lack of comparison group, and the subjective nature of quali tative assessment and analysis. ACBH will continue to work with the program evaluator to better capture the results of PEI programs and the longer -term impact on clie nts.

Note: 1,000 -character limit. Our team supported a 13 -year -old student from Guatemala. She immigrated to the U.S with her biological mother in search of better opportunities. We supported the student for six months due t o her history of severe depression, anxiety, low self- esteem, and active suicidal Ideation. For six years she had been dealing with these conditions in silence due to the stigma around mental health within her family. Student is learning to cope with the d isappearance of her Father, who immigrated to the U.S 6 years ago and whom she has not heard from ever since. Her Mother's health condition is another stressor in her life. The student has learned to identify her protective factors to reduce risk.

Client has been successfully connected to long -term treatment to continue receiving the support she needs to continue building her self-esteem, developing relationships, improv ing life skills, and managing her symptoms. Box E: Program challenges of the past year and how did the agency mitigate challenges? Note: 1,000 - character limit. Staff turnover across most agencies and districts (including Alameda County) has resulted in a barrier to link participants to long- term services, once the need has been identified and some level of care has been provided through the UIY program, the team has been able to support those in need by creating community within their own community. We have collaborated with community partners and school health centers to provide wrap around support and services. In partnership, we are providing workshop and support groups where students and families are learning to navigate resources and build trust within their own community. Box F: Program lessons learned of the past year? Note: 1,000 -character limit. We learned that access to care and preventative mental health services with vulnerable communities of color is significantly more successful in person. We also learned that healing in community is needed and well received by the communities UIY program serves. Furthermore, we received feedback that having a program name with the word \"immigrant\" can discourage participations due to n egative experiences this community has had in the past.

Note: 1,000 -character limit. Our program surpassed all its service objectives for this fiscal year, including individual and group interventions, outreach and supporting other service providers. We increased the number of successful referrals to mental health and other social services, as well as to traditional healing resources and improved our client's experience with a reduction in waiting time for first -time appointments to less than a week in most cases. An overall satisfaction with our services was demonstrated in the yearly client satisfaction survey and we also received positive feedback from attendees to our traditional healing and community events. An evaluation conducted by the CDPH - OHE, demonstrated that our program is effective in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression as well as increasing resiliency through cultural affirmation and community -based and traditional healing interventions. Box E: Program challenges of the past year and how the agency mitigate d challenges? Note: 1,000 - character limit. Pandemic restrictions in in -person meetings continue to be a challenge as we were forced to go back to virtual sessions and meetings during the surges which greatly impacted attendance. We had to cancel some activities, due to staff shortages and/or unsafe conditions due to a rapid increase in COVID cases in our communities. A significant increase in demand was met with 2 staff departures, a temporary leave a nd a very difficult time recruiting bilingual/bicultural providers, which resulted in delays in programming and staff working beyond their capacity to meet the needs of our clients. The increase in demand also brought to light the limited resources availab le for communities of color, as in many cases we were unable to find appropriate mental health resources that had available space for our clients. Finally, a combination of COVID restrictions and increase in demand have made our physical spaces insufficien t to meet client's needs and ensure staff and participant's safety. Box F: Program lessons learned of the past year? Note: 1,000 -character limit. Staff self-care and development is very important, especially during the pandemic when demand increased not only in numbers but also in its intensity. In the upcoming year we will be creating more opportunities for training and for emotional and otherwise support for our own staff and other providers and healers in our community. Along the same lines, we have learned that community empowerment and participation is crucial in prevention in mental health and so we will be creating more opportunities for consumers and community leaders to become trained, involved and en gaged in our program. In addition, ongoing coordination and communication among partners and outside agencies has proven to be effective in helping us connect community members to resources and/or to engage them and brake cycles of isolation or build effe ctive networks of support and available space for our clients. Finally, a combination of COVID restrictions and increase in demand have made our physical spaces insufficient to meet client's needs and ensure staff and participant's safety.

Note: 1,000 -character limit. We developed and trained new culturally and linguistically experienced staff members with various talents and a strong passion to serve. We were able to build a cohesive and collective team who listened to community needs and provided a variety of responsive services. A portion of our work focused on empowering Asian immigrant parents who shared increased concerns over th e community trauma and their impacts on mental health. We responded by cultivating parenting support groups and workshops in languages that helped to increase their knowledges on emotional wellness, anti -racism, community trauma, self -harm, self -care, and managing boundaries. A success involved an individual who was triggered by current events that led to reexperiencing traumatic incidents. The individual had become isolated and withdrawn, leading to prolonged emotional distress. After months of care, the individual reported the ability to manage emotional distress, engage with peers, and return to normal routines. Box E: Program challenges of the past year and how the agency mitigate d challenges? Note: 1,000 - character limit. Our program faced challenges with staffing shortage, especially with the counseling level staff. Demand for care increased during parts of the year as well due to continued stress from the pandemic and community issues; fortunately, we were able to meet demand with help fr om our master level interns/trainees. We built new collaborations with local academic institutions that provided East Asian language interns and trainees who were able to provide care - they quickly learned how to best serve our community members as well. We are fortunate to be able to bring on a former trainee as an employee to fulfil our staffing needs for the upcoming year. We updated a variety of outreach methods to engage a broader audience. We established a collaborative network with 1000 community partners using emails, AHS social media platform, YouTube channel, and webpage. These engagements helped us to further spread the preventative works to community members through multiple channels. Box F: Program lessons learned of the past year? Note: 1,000 -character limit. Developing an internship/training program is a key part in helping to support client care services as well as supporting a pipeline of future mental health professionals. We saw this first -hand how impactful the work our interns/trainees provided to our community members and how this can encourage a new wave of professionals to serve our community. A combination of virtual and in person activities will continue again this year. We have obse rved that the distress from the pandemic and community violence have impacted our community members' interest in seeking in person events and care. It is important to further invest in virtual and in person outreach support with tools such as recording options, language captions, and safe environments for community members to gather in person.

Note: 1,000 -character limit. We expanded youth programs, engaging children, teens, and TAY with art, nature, social justice, and academic support. We had monthly field trips to reduce isolation from COVID and anti -Asian hate, with 60 adult/older adult clients at each visit. We trained direct practice staff in EMDR, IFS, and the flash technique to prevent acute PTSD with evidence -based practices. We began a support group for adult children of genocide survivors struggling with mental illness. Our UELP program made us competitive for awa rds from private foundations, CA Dept of Social Services, CA Dept of Health Care Services, CA Natural Resources Agency, and MHSOAC. Soch joined CERI this year, struggling with physical health issues and isolation that triggered PTSD symptoms and suicidalit y. CERI connected Soch to public benefits, psychiatric medication, and trauma therapy. Her kids joined youth programs and preventive counseling. Now Soch attends support groups and field trips, and the whole family feels more ease. Box E: Program challen ges of the past year and how the agency mitigate d challenges? Note: 1,000 - character limit. This year we had a rapid expansion of services and staff. While our numbers for preventive counseling remain the same, we've had a 20% increase in referrals for support groups, care management, and prevention visits. We serve youths who range in age from 6 to 24 as well as adults who struggle with mental illness and substance abuse, populations that have distinct needs and require us to figure out how to skillfull y navigate sharing our small office space to offer groups and services. We are addressing this through improving communication across programs and developing staff training to address diverse client concerns and presentations around mental health. Managing staff overwhelm and preventing burnout through supportive supervision, staff retreat, and encouraging time off and self - care have been critical this year as the demand for services increased in the context of COVID, anti - Asian hate, climate crisis, global conflicts and war, and a polarizing political landscape. Box F: Program lessons learned of the past year? Note: 1,000 -character limit. This year we reaffirmed the critical need for groups, not only for our older adults, but also for our youths and adults struggling with chronic mental illness. We experienced an increased demand for care management and referrals for COVID relief services, public benefits and resources including housing, food, medical care and insurance, legal services, and more. We recognized that we need to improve our on -boarding training for staff, so that as an organization we are well equipped to address diverse client concerns and presentations/acuities around mental health, which is why we plan to integrate a Mental Health First Aid training for our direct practice staff. Finally, we saw the importance of in -person activities to reduce isolation and found opportunities to do so safely in the evolving COVID context.

Note: 1,000 -character limit. Our Arise team had very successful collaborations with a local high school for coordinating community events this year. We were able to provide guidance and support for students and their parents to engage the adolescent population, which made attendance at the events higher than past adolescent targeted events we've held. Another accomplishment was transitioning back to in -person activities/groups/events for older adults and senior clients . Having in -person meetings again helped improve the mood for seniors and gave them a sense of community as opposed to feelings of isolation during the previous year due to Covid19 Public Health Emergency. We had one case of a Korean elderly client who had recently lost her son and was grieving. Having prevention visits, providing emotional support with our Korean speaking Outreach Worker helped her process her grief and improved her mood and reduced her loneliness. She was very appreciative of the Preventi on Visits. Box E: Program challenges of the past year and how the agency mitigate d challenges? Note: 1,000 - character limit. During this contract year, our biggest challenge was staffing. Our Mental Health Specialist, Hongmei Qu, left in July 2021 and we haven't been able to hire her replacement yet. We had a promising candidate who later withdrew her application due to finding another position with a higher salary. Many candidates were also in search of remote work, not in -person work. Without an MHS, we were unable to provide prevention counseling services. The Program Manager, Loc Tran, also left Arise at the end of Mar 2022. As the new Program Manager is coming onboard in April, I noticed deliverables that were behind schedule on: community events an d psychoeducation workshops. One of our Outreach Workers also started her graduate program and needed to reduce her hours from 1.0 to 0.2 FTE starting in Jan 2022. I believe with a full staff and team, Arise would have easily completed all deliverables as it had in the previous contract year. Box F: Program lessons learned of the past year? Note: 1,000 -character limit. We learned to utilize Outreach Workers to provide workshops in the absence of a Mental Health Specialist. This also gave Outreach Workers more opportunities to expand and add to their skillset, something that was a welcome challenge for them. For engaging and incentivizing more participation and attendance at events, we learned to collaborate with student leaders for their ideas and their connections. We also learned to incorporate day before reminders for workshops/presentations to help increase attendance at workshops.

Note: 1,000 - character limit. The agency experienced a large influx of new arrivals needing services due to the crisis in Afghanistan. Afghan Coalition was at or over capacity daily in our efforts to assist the new arrivals who either were sent to our area or left military bases on their own accord. To mitigate this increase in clients with complex needs, the program hired new staff and held several workshops and events that would reach many clients at once with information, resources, and enrollment to our Wellness program. Consortium Meetings, Workshops and Support group topics predominately addressed the issues an d needs or new arrivals. Significant stigma reduction needs to be provided to newly arrived Afghans who historically have a negative outlook on receiving mental health services although many suffer from PTSD, depression , and anxiety. Community Workers help ed to mitigate this by increasing the rate of acceptance of mental service by encouraging clients to participate in the Wellness program. Box F: Program lessons learned of the past year? Note: 1,000 -character limit. Many of the refugees that we assisted were experiencing \"Survivor Mode\" and were not initially interested in the Wellness Program since their concern was more for addressing their basic needs such as food, housing, and employment. Although some clients expressed a need for mental heal th services many were reluctant to start individual counseling until they had met other needs such as access to social services, a place to live, jobs and transportation. Efforts were made by our staff and with resettlement agencies to ensure that clients ' basic needs were being met and access to mental health was provided for those interested clients. Continued efforts are made through outreach, home visits, invites to support groups, workshops, and cultural events to ensure clients have access to the men tal health services they may need. In addition, helping clients have realistic expectations of getting settled in the US was another issue that we faced working with new Afghan arrivals.

Went from weekly meeting to bi -monthly general meetings and revised curriculum to adapt to what youth found most engaging. Having program housed in our Oakland office, while the most central location, provided challenges with youth coming from other North County cities versus being housed online and at Encinal High School (Alameda) previously. Staff and youth trained for more face -to-face outreach supplemented with social media efforts. Navigating engagemen t points for TAY due to the nature of this target population \u2014TAY tends to be among the busiest target populations due to school, work, extracurricular activities, etc. Shifts were made to topics most salient: Financial Literacy, Navigating burnout, discuss ions on Representation, or Trans Visibility. Elder adult participants were still hesitant to attend in person workshops and meetings because of COVID so interactive virtual workshops were offered. Box F: Program lessons learned of the past year? Note: 1,000 -character limit. Community building activities and space to discuss feelings are even more important in ensuring youth are engaged and feel welcome than a year prior. Pausing from planning meetings to have talking circles was needed to resolve issues. COVID -19 and deciding on engagement via Zoom, hybrid or in -person meetings: Zoom tended to have higher turnout due to greater accessibility Having workshops on -site where TAY bases are the most - turnout and engagement tended to be higher at a community college resource center than FAJ's satellite office due to accessibility of location . We learned the importance of building and maintaining good working partnerships with school staff and admi nistration to better serve our communities within the schools.

Note: 1,000 -character limit. One event that our team is particularly proud of was our first in -person community event since COVID - 19 that too k place in June. This event brought together Afghan new arrivals to Lake Merritt with a variety of events including art, soccer, and games. We also had the IRC Oakland Economic Empowerment Team and partner agencies including Multi -Lingual Counseling, Meditation Without Borders, ARTogether facilitating events and discussing their services with clients. One of the male clients that attended shared that he had been feeling very isolated and this was the first time he had left his hotel since arrival, was able to speak to others in his own language, meet other Afghans, and feel a sense of community. Box E: Program challenges of the past year and how the agency mitigate d challenges? Note: 1,000 - character limit. One challenge we faced was getting men to enroll and participate in our program. We made it a goal for this year to enroll men into our one -on-one counseling and group services. We partnered with our Economic Empowerment team to do men's workshops around finance and stress management to encourage attendance and both address a source of stress while providing tools to manage stress. We saw success with this model and were able to increase men attending our group workshops and our one-on-one counseling. As we started getting male participation, we also intentionally sought feedback about services both in material delivered and logistics including time and place to best meet the needs of our male clients and reduce barriers to accessing our services. Box F: Program lessons learned of the past year? Note: 1,000 -character limit. A lesson learned from the past year was around connecting clients to mental health treatment. One barrier was lack of trust with individuals outside of the PEI Team. Clients were familiar with IRC and had heard from the community the work done by IRC and the PEI team but were not familiar with Mental Health Treatment organizations which led to clients declining referrals to longer term support. Thus, the team sought to reduce this barrier and brought in staff from Mental Health Treatment organizations such as Multilingual Counseling to speak about their services with clients. We found that this model, particularly when done in person, decreased hesitancy in clients to accept referrals as they had met someone that worked there and heard directly from them the type of support they provided. This model is one we will be incorporating into future services as well including workshops, events, and support groups.

Note: 1,000 -character limit. We have seen many successes and accomplishments this past year as we are approaching our third year of using Telehealth platforms. We continued to help community members maintain anonymity and minimize barriers to treatment. We were able to offer 10 consi stent support groups this year, 2 in Farsi, 5 in Nepali, 1 in English and 2 in Hindi. Through outreach we were able to increase referrals to our program and help make more referrals to higher levels of care through ACBH. With the roll out of vaccines and boosters we were able to go back on school campuses, participate in a lot more in -person outreach and education and offer in person PC sessions. We increased outreach to the LGBTQ community, collaborated with more organizations to increase access to resour ces/vaccinations/rental assistance/food/PPE, we continued to offer our coping strategies workshops bi -weekly, and we observed an increase in youth engagement . Box E: Program challenges of the past year and how the agency mitigate d challenges? Note: 1,000 - character limit. We experienced challenges around varying COVID protocols throughout the year, preventing us from working in the community. We tried to have telehealth options for back up. There were still some instances of low -tech literacy within the community, in which case we tried to provide more education and open the clinic for folks to use our tech devices to log into groups/workshops. We couldn't offer in person support groups at our clinic due to social distancing and other COVID protocols, we did Zoom groups and offered groups outdoors. Many were still struggling after the 1 year of PC and wanted to continue for a longer time, we advocated with the county to help provide extensions as needed, we supported participants in getting Medi -Cal and s upported them in utilizing holistic healing. We adapted a new EHR while still having to interface with the county EHR so that added additional tasks for our team, we attempted to come up with streamlined process to lower the overwhelm . Box F: Program lessons learned of the past year? Note: 1,000 -character limit. Some lessons learned: a) The need for telehealth services to continue even after pandemic accommodations are lifted b) The need for more outdoor in person events, as community member s still have fears around COVID but are also feeling very disconnected c) The importance of talking about taboo topics such as gender, sexuality, and substance use within the South Asian community. d) The impact of case management and resource sharin g. e) Our program is impacting a lot of change within the community, and we need to discuss with the county to have more opportunities to share the impacts so that funding can be increased. We need more advocacy to increase the total amount of prevention visits + Preventive Counseling for longer than 1 year .

Note: 1,000 -character limit. The success or accomplishment that really sticks out for this year has been the perseverance of the staff. So many obstacles have been put in our path. Be it COVD -19 protocols, lack of in -person programing, grief & loss, or just burn -out. Staff rose to the occ asion & came up with plans to mitigate the challenges. Staff are closer, they lean on each other, & we have learned a lot. The team stepped up & made things happen for our community. Driving around & doing food deliveries to families. Staff always made su re the youth had activities in the bags. Our elders got special care packages. Staff went to visit with elders at their homes when making deliveries, spoke & shared a little time before the next delivery. Some of our elders stated we were their only visito rs during this time. Staff did a fabulous job with whatever circumstance came their way; we made wonderful strides in our community& bonded with our Youth & Elders on a whole different level. Box E: Program challenges of the past year and how the agency mitigate d challenges? Note: 1,000 - character limit. 1) Being able to hold events & groups with limited capacity. Once we were able to start holding very small groups and some small events that took place outside, we made it happen. We look forward to being able to bring in our community at the capacity prior to the pandemic, until then we will utilize the virtual world and be more creative. 2) Transportation has been an issue for some time, one staff was added to the drivers list. This opens so much opportunity for our program. When we had our youth in attendance they mostly walked or took public transportation. We can now do more pick - ups & drops offs with our youth as well as take them out on field trips that are further away . Box F: Program lessons learned of the past year? Note: 1,000 -character limit. The lessons learned: 1) We realize now how important our gatherings & groups are to our community. We do not have a large number in neighborhoods, schools, or other environments, so we gather to create that space. We have missed each other so holding small events & groups is refreshing & healing. Our mental health is greatly improved when we get to be with each other. You do not realize the true value of something until you don't have it. 2) Virtual space has value & can work on many levels. The virtual platforms have taught us that it's ok to meet virtually, that sometimes it works out better for everyone to meet from their location instead of taking time to travel, it's a cost -effecti ve alternative. For example: holding a parent meeting/orientation virtually so parents don't need to attend in person and can be in their own home taking care of their family.

PTR's African Communities Program reached a total of 2511 community members, provided counseling to 36 unique clients, and engaged in the following activities: 13 psychoeducational workshops; 3 educational workshops; 3 support groups; 6 community events; 16 MH c onsultations; 76 prevention visits for potential clients; and distributed program materials in 5 listservs. A major accomplishment was conducting a series of decolonizing mental health events and community -based healing workshops that were tailored to spec ific needs of the community without any stigma such as suicide prevention and response, mental health 101, intergenerational trauma, and generational gaps. Also, the community expressed feelings connected to and an ownership of the programming this year. P TR has also maximized reach to African communities in the Bay Area through diversifying outreach approaches and partnering with universities, associations, CBOs, and non -profit organizations. Box E: Program challenges of the past year and how the agency mitigate d challenges? Note: 1,000 - character limit. The main challenge continued to be entering personal client information in the InSyst system, and 3 clients did not consent to being registered in InSyst. Most of our clients are asylum seekers, many of whose immigration status is currently uncertain. Given their past histories of trauma and insecure legal status, sharing personal information causes clients stress and anxiety. To respond to this, PTR created a unique consent form, tip -sheet, and user -friendly referral form for UELP clients that indicate the information shared in InSyst, and the level of protection guaranteed by Alameda County. PTR provided prevention visits for 76 potential clients and conducted mental health consultations for 59 communit y members, which is an auspicious sign of PTR's ability to increase the number of PEI counseling clients. Since many community members seek immediate services due to the urgency of their needs, PTR is also improving its internal approach to respond more pr omptly to referrals. Box F: Program lessons learned of the past year? Note: 1,000 -character limit. Having a series of community dialogues with community leaders and involving them in identifying the needs of the community and weaving their constructive feedback into the program helped to ensure community -led approach, community buy -in, and ownership to the program. African communities have diverse needs in addressing mental health issues, and using local language, tailored and context specif ic topics to respond to the different needs of the community increased community openness and destigmatized mental health care. Virtual engagement helped to reach out to the community wherever they are, and enhance access to services particularly for mothe rs, people who work multiple jobs or community members who have longer commuting time and expenses. The diverse perspectives, ethics, and experiences of PTR's African Communities Program staff , all of whom are immigrants --were relatable to the community we serve, and informed programming.

Note: 1,000 -character limit. Due to our outreach & engagement efforts Sidra connected with a MENA family that required a lot of support. Financial burdens and obligations brought a lot of anxiety to the family which resulted in major Health complications that effected the father. The Father suff ered from diabetes and resulted in amputating part of his foot. Sidra's effort played a significant role in supporting the family through psychoeducation, 1on1 counseling, and connection to resources. Through our preventative visits, we connected the family with other resources (Rental assistance, Vaccine Clin ics). Moreover, Sidra assisted the clients in explaining and translating various documents/paperwork. Sidra's goal was also to empower the mother and daughter. Mom enrolled in English courses to impr ove her language skills. Daughter joined one of Sidra's cultural group sessions. Sidra enrolled the family in In Home Supportive Services. Mom earned income as a provider by supporting her husband. Box E: Program challenges of the past year and how the agency mitigate d challenges? Note: 1,000 - character limit. Sidra faced some challenges during the past year. Covid19 remained a major challenge to us and our clients. We overcame this challenge by providing a hybrid model for group sessions & workshops. Sidra provided clients in the MENA community with PPE materials (masks, sanitizers, Covid test kits). Sidra had some personnel transitions this year, where our PM/Clinical specialist & Clinical Supervisor transitioned out of Sidra. This created some chal lenges for us. Despite these challenges and the lack of Arabic speaking M.H specialists, Sidra recruited a new Clinical Supervisor & a new M.H specialist (Farsi speaking) trainee. Sidra is still in the process of recruiting more culturally sensitive clinic ians and outreach coordinators. Stigma regarding mental health remains a challenge. However, with Sidra's psychoeducational group sessions, workshops, 1on1 visits, and art sessions we can gradually destigmatize mental health in the MENA community. Box F: Program lessons learned of the past year? Note: 1,000 -character limit. We learned that clients coming from the MENA community do not always share the same culture, traditions, and values. That's why we at DHTI -Sidra strive to hire culturally sensitive clinicians and outreach coordinators that can build rapport with clients coming from different cultures and sharing different backgrounds. We also learned that partnering with schools is essential. During the past year Sidra continued its partner ship with Oakland International Highschool & West Oakland Middle school. Sidra partnered up with KIPP school to assist the MENA students and their families. After a year of marketing for additional Arabic -speaking M.H specialists, we learned that there is a lack of Arabic - speaking M.H specialists & outreach workers who can better serve and support the MENA communities. We hope to continue our recruitment effort and increase our efforts to shed a light on the need of culturally responsive M.H workers to serv e the MENA community.

Note: 1,000 -character limit. Through COST, 9700 students across 268 schools and 14 school districts in Alameda County were referred and linked to behavioral health services and supports \u201446% more than last year. As students returned to in -person learning, schools saw a drastic increase in behavioral health support for stude nts. They built upon the multidisciplinary COST referral system by training staff, using virtual and in -person team meetings and referrals, increasing number of Wellness Centers and on -site providers, and strengthening partnerships with community providers . Many districts reported successfully reconnecting with students, who were struggling during shelter -in place, with needed behavioral health and academic support resulting in improvements. Schools referred mor e students with severe mental illness to treat ment. One district connected a transgender student with suicidal ideation to community - based clinician specialized in LGBTQ students and on -going support through the school's Wellness Center. Box E: Program challenges of the past year and how did the agency mitigate challenges? Note: 1,000 - character limit. COVID -19 pandemic and distance learning had a profound impact on behavioral and mental health of students and families. Schools were met by an increased need for mental health support and services, while faced with school and provider staff shortages and inconsistency, resulting in an inability to meet demand. This included an increased need to refer students with severe mental illness to higher levels of treatment but a limited number of providers a nd resources. School districts that mainly provided services in -house, developed partnerships with off -site providers to serve more students. While schools that had existing partnerships with off -sites agencies strengthened their communication and coordina tion. Finally, schools offered more prevention and early intervention drop -in and on -site positive youth development programming to support students. Box F: Program lessons learned of the past year? Note: 1,000 -character limit. The return to in -person learning coupled with an increased need for behavioral health referrals led to strengthening existing referral systems. School districts streamlined their referral process, trained, and educated more staff on COST and Multi -Tiered Systems of Support (MTSS ), and developed increased ability for student self -referrals. Schools saw the need to strengthen outreach and partnership with families to provide mental health and social service supports. Schools increased partnerships with community -based organizations (CBOs) that could provide culturally and linguistically proficient outreach and services to diverse families in the district. They found that providing school -based family programs and resources are crucial in strengthening families and connecting them to services. Finally, districts are voicing the need for more funding, staff and providers that can meet the need for higher levels of mental health services for students and families.

Note: 1,000 -character limit. One program success that is still ongoing is blending in person and virtual services to support behavior challenges in one classroom. Consultant and teachers were able to hold a Zoom meeting with parents to better understand the student's needs, identify expec tations for all involved, and identify interventions. The consultant was able to provide in person observations, build rapport with the student and family, and support the teachers in identifying potentially helpful strategies to meet the students' needs as well as other students in the classroom. This center has done a great job with communication and incorporating virtual services. In fact, starting in February 2022 consultant will be hosting/facilitating virtual parent cafes to support navigating parenting needs and social emotional development. The mental health consultant was able to meet regularly with the teachers and site supervisor to provide a reflective space to support the mental health needs of the children. Box E: Program challenges of the past year and how did the agency mitigate challenges? Note: 1,000 -character limit. This past year our department has had a high turnover. Consultants have done their best to navigate these transitions by continuing to put our programs and clients first. Maintaining group and individual supervision has also served as an invaluable resource for consultants as we attempt to support similar challenges at our sites. (At our sites staffing has been a major issue. Many teachers have needed time off to car e for family, recharge, or take care of personal needs making it difficult for coverage and causing creative approaches). COVID 19 continues to impact services causing consultants to be mindful of gauging the need for in person or virtual services. Box F: Program lessons learned of the past year? Note: 1,000 -character limit. This year we are continuing to find ways to incorporate technology into our services as well as up to date health and safety protocol. As always, we are learning to be flexible, the importance of relationship building, and meeting individuals where they are at. This year we are learning the value of slowing down and honoring our strengths and differences and sitting with the unknown. An additional challenge presented this school y ear is the high rate of children and families getting covid -19 at the preschool, and the impact on the sense of safety in the staff and families. Our program supported the preschool reflecting on additional procedures to prevent spreading the virus and kee p children enrolled in the program. Additionally, the mental health consultant provided support to the staff to help them be attuned to the children socio -emotional needs.

Note: 1,000 -character limit. The client is a 74 -year -old, White female who is a published author with no social support. She resides independently and is not connected to mental health care. She was referred by Mobile Crisis for follow - up and linkage. GART clinician completed an assessment and found that the client's house is cluttered with cat feces everywhere, client at risk o f losing housing, has rotten food in fridge, evidence of recent stovetop fire, client out of psychiatric medication, client struggles with anxiety, poor short -term memory, money management, and had a broken phone. Clinician assisted the client in obtaining new phone, connect to PCP, apply for Medi -Cal, transported the client to same day medication support, filled her prescription, and helped her sign up for free food delivery for elders . Box E: Program of the past year and how did the agency mitigate challenges? Note: 1,000 -character limit. GART received many referrals for individuals between the ages of 55 -59. Unfortunately, the program originally served individuals 60 and above. Many individuals were falling through the gap and were turned away due to the age requirement. Although GART was designed to be field based, due to the pandemic, GART had only provided telephone and telehealth. Many clients needed in -person services. To mitigate the challenges, GART lowered the age requir ement for program participation to 55 and older with the understanding that individuals with SMI are frequently functioning as 20 -25 years older than their natural age. As a result, GART is serving more clients. Box F: Program lessons learned of the pas t year? Note: 1,000 -character limit. GART learned that while telephone and telehealth -based services can be convenient for some clients, many clients are without the proper equipment to access services. GART understands the importance of having a variety of methods to engage with clients. GART plans to give clients the option of meeting in the office at any of our office locations throughout Alameda County, in the community, at the clients' homes, via telephone or video, and at facilities. We learned that it's important to meet our clients where it is convenient for them to improve engagement outcomes. Further, while mental health linkage is our primary goal, we understand that the clients' basic needs are as important. We learned to prioritize the needs of our clients holistically. We learned the importance of training our clinicians about community resources, including housing and food.

Note: 1,000 -character limit. The program provides on demand crisis support to individuals including those who may have a history of trauma when interfacing with the mental health system. One texter reported managing frequent and intense suicidal urges, as well as urges to self -harm and use substances to cope. The t exter works collaboratively with program staff and volunteers to disable the suicide means and to make a safety plan. The texter shared their identify as an African American woman with mental illness and trauma and \"this world is not for me and has never b een.\" Because of her lived experience, the texter often declines referrals to higher level of care. The text line program is available to provide services to people who may not interface with greater behavioral health care system but can still benefit from its support. With the support of the program manager at Sally's Place, the texter agreed to drive herself to Sally's Place to receive a higher level of care. Box E : Program challenges of the past year and how did the agency mitigate challenges? Note: 1,000 - character limit. The program needs more support with oversight and training. Last year we scheduled a shift supervisor on every shift, and this year we hired a Text Line Coordinator who will provide oversight, training, and supervisor. We hope to expand text line coverage to 16 hours/day by September 1st, 2022 and be 24 hours/ 7 days week by July 2025. The challenge will be to train enough volunteers to cover all the shifts, so we created a paid position called Text Line Counselor. Last year, we hired and trained a bi -lingual Spanish text line shift supervisor who will be able to respond to community members in Spanish during certain hours of the week. This part time position is funded by a Grant from Kaiser. The Spanish text line was utilized only 5 times. The supervisor has done targeted marketing to youth centers and Spanish speaking providers. She also spoke with a reporter from El Tecolote about our services. Box F: Program lessons learned of the past year? Note: 1,000 -character limit. Young people and their family/support systems continue to impress us with their remarkable resilience and adaptability to an uncertain world during a global pandemic. Although our Text Line serves clients with a variety of struggles, several common themes that our texters have recently approached us about include psychological trauma, interpersonal challenges, and anxiety/stress regarding school. This year was particularly a challenging year for several clients, too, as many of them expressed feelings of isolation and anxiety due to the COVID -19 pandemic. Some youth texters also mentioned experiencing more family conflict because of the lockdown restrictions earlier in the year, along with di fficulties focusing on online school PREVENTION & EARLY INTERVENTION (PEI) PROGRAM SUMMARIES535 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Box G: For programs that refer individuals with severe mental illness , please provide information for the categories below: G.1: Unduplicated number of individuals with severe mental illness referred to a higher level of care within ACBH system (i.e. mental health treatment services): 6 G.2: Unduplicated number of individuals with severe mental illness referred to a higher level of care outside ACBH system (i.e. mental health treatment services): NA G.3: Types of treatment individuals were referred to (list types) (500 - character limit): Crisis stabilization units including: Amber House, Sally's Place, Mobile Crisis Unit, Children's Hospital, Willow Rock G.4: Unduplicated number of individuals who participated in referred program at least one time : NA G.5: Average duration of untreated mental illness in weeks : NA G.6: Average number of days between referral and first participation in referred treatment program: NA Box H: For programs that work to improve timely access to mental health services for underserved populations , please provide information on the categories below: H.1: Who is/are the underserved target population(s) your program is serving (e.g .

Note: 1,000 -character limit. We had teachers that valued the impact of our programming that accommodated us virtually even though their stated preference was for us to come in person. We also had teachers that took that extra step to assist with Q&A engagement if their camera was not working, by letting our speakers know if there was a raised hand. We were able to present and engage more than one classroom at a time, which supported our capacity. We were able to gath er pre -/post survey data and distribute TFL cards. While we spoke to our resources on our PowerPoint, youth having a tangible card to walk away with is ideal. This spring we created an internship position to host a peer guide through Chabot College. Her name is Marjorie Bartholome. She was tasked with a social media project aimed at increasing awareness on how to provide support to someone at suicidal risk, though the national #BeThe1To campaign. Box E: Program challenges of the past year and how did the agency mitigate challenges? Note: 1,000 -character limit. Before the onset of the Covid19 pandemic, outreaching to primary care clinics and other healthcare settings in Alameda County was challenging partly due to the inherent nature of community health clinics being very busy and finding time for training. Many of our trainings frequently occurred during a time when a clinic was closed for lunch. In these 2 years of the pandemic, we hosted virtual presentations for health care providers nearly every month and on different days and times to attempt to reach our target population who were among the most important frontline workers against Covid19. A significant challenge was that while registration would be high at times for these workshops, attendance wa s about 50% or less. Other times, registration would be low, and would need to be cancelled. While attendance was low, we were heartened that healthcare workers were attending and using their time to receive the training. Box F: Program lessons learned o f the past year? Note: 1,000 -character limit. Our attention is also focused on continuing to learn more and adjust our trainings to reflect a cultural lens for suicide prevention. Among those changes include the following: 1) Recognizing that risk and protective factors need to be presented in a socio -ecological context. This model acknowledges that suicide is more than an individual issue and that external factors such as structural racism is a mechanism in producing disparities in risk, protective factors, and access to quality effective intervention among communities of color. 2) Utilizing the Cultural Model for Suicide that 3 principles which include, that culture affects the types of stressors that lead to suicide, and that culture affects how su icidal thoughts, intent, plans, and attempts. 3) We are also looking forward to hiring a Bilingual (Spanish -Speaking) community education trainer who's focus will be on parent engagement and a Bilingual (Spanish -speaking) TFL Health Educator.

Note: 1,000 -character limit. This year we relaunched our survivor of suicide loss group, with a new curriculum and a focus on maintaining connections to loved ones. We also were able to offer this group in person, with COVID safe policies, due to the commitment of the facilitators. The group drew inspiration from John Jordan's Grief After Suicide and focused on the participants telling the stories of their loss, making meaning of the unique experience of suicide, and discussing the impact of cultural discourses rela ted to suicide. The group was well attended, with eight members, and received positive responses from attendees. Due to the lack of suicide loss groups nationwide, the clinical program plans to develop this curriculum and offer it for free on our website in the hope other groups or agencies can also address this need more fully. Box E: Program challenges of the past year and how did the agency mitigate challenges? Note: 1,000 -character limit. Our program continued to struggle with the restrictions due to COVID, particularly with regards to engaging our school aged clients and their families. This was most notable with our elementary aged youth. Our program offered services via telemedicine, but experienced significant improvements in engagement when sc hool returned to in person instruction. The clinical program collaborated with the agency and with our interns to develop COVID safe practices and ensure as much safety as possible. The increase in frequency in person services across all clinical programs has had a significant impact on intern's positive engagement with clients and with the training environment. Telemedicine continues to be an option when needed, and our cloud based electronic health system allows interns to work remotely, but the return to office has resulted in more compliance with documentation. Box F: Program lessons learned of the past year? Note: 1,000 -character limit. We have learned to be flexible and adaptive, such as transferring all documentation to our cloud -based system, re- creating Google forms of hard copies, and transferring some meetings to an online platform. We have also learned that remote learning provides significant barriers and that some interns require in person meetings. We have also realized that our clients can be adaptive as well, and can create community on virtual platforms, but that there continues to be a preference for in -person services across all age categories. There will likely be an ongoing need for both in person and virtual services, and so ther e will be additional trainings on telemedicine along with how to respond to stressors connected to the COVID pandemic.

Note: 1,000 -character limit. (1) We continue to strengthen our relationship with community partners, particularly with the COST team at Castlemont High School. When attending their weekly meetings, in addition to being a support to those youth that the school -based clinicians do not have the capacity to see, we have been able to share wellness programming ideas that have helped youth members in our center that the school is considering. (2) With the return to school we have found that many youth are struggling with re - socialization into crowds and of ten feeling unsafe when needing to come to us for their session. So, our clinicians walk over to Castlemont to meet them and then walk with them back to our center. Youth have been very reception to this process, and we will continue to do this if we see the need for youth support in this way. (3) We have seen an increase in youth who are utilizing our wellness services needing clothing. Given the pandemic and many places who have stopped services in this area, we have been giving gift cards to local sto res so youth can purchase clothing. Box E: Program challenges of the past year and how did the agency mitigate challenges? Note: 1,000 - character limit. Youth UpRising has experienced challenges around hiring, particularly a permanent hire for the Mental Health & Wellness Director role. To mitigate this challenge, we have hired a consultant in this role, and it has been working out very well. The consultant has provided great supervisorial support in addition to helping in our wellness programming. We've also had some challenges with getting groups started as youth have not been receptive to being in a crowd, while small, and sharing things they may be going through from a wellness perspective. What w e have done in this area is collaborated with the UCSF/Castlemont Health Clinic for a Grief & Loss Group as they reached out requesting the partnership.

Note: 1,000 -character limit. \"Mr. Omar\" arrived recently from Afghanistan with 4 children ages 3 -12 and his wife. As the Family Resource was assessing his situation, she realized the children were not in school. She added school enrollment as a goal for the family after explaining that it is against the law for children to not attend school. Mr. Omar broke down when he heard this b ecause he did not know how he could even think about school when he did not even know if he would have a place for his family to live. He explained that as the father, it was his responsibility to be the provider. He shared that ever since the family arriv ed in the United States, he has not stopped worrying , he did not have a car, he was unfamiliar with the area, and he spoke little English. He clearly was experiencing a great deal of anxiety. Our Family Resource Specialist spent 2.5 hours with Mr. Omar reviewing all of his needs. Our staff informed him that they would call the case worker in charge of immigration to follow -up with his case. We also assured him that we would help meet the family's basic needs such as health insurance, clothing, and food. That day he went home with hope. Our Family Resource Specialist immediately called the case worker and was provided with the information Mr. Omar needed. Our staff also began resource stabilization, the first step in an ongoing process to support this family. Building rapport and having success help to create a positive experience that then leads to further goals on family wellness. Box E : Program challenges of the past year and how did the agency mitigate challenges? Note: 1,000 - character limit. There continues to be a lack of coun seling services available in Dari, Pashto, Urdu, and Punjabi, resulting in long delays for people seeking mental health services. In some cases, clients do not show interest in receiving mental health support because their other needs take precedence. Our staff explain to these clients the various ways to take care of their health when clients share that they are experiencing anxiety or depression. Working families are ineligible for services such as rental assistance, whic h exacerbates serious mental health issues. Encounters with Afghan refugees are time - consuming because of the issues and needs that they have. This adds stress on staff as they are part - time. Staff also experience vicarious trauma. Box F : Program lessons learned of the past year? Note: 1,000 -character limit. We have learned that patience is key, and boundaries are necessary. We also have learned that everyone who visits our program has an expectation to receive something tangible from their encounter. T his can be an appointment, for example, but must be more than simply a business card with a telephone number. Staff taking the initiative to call people is much more helpful, positive, and impactful for those seeking support .

Note: 1,000 -character limit. BMS (Black Men Speak) challenges have been around meeting our required speaking engagements due to COVID19 restrictions. We embraced Zoom meetings as a way of completing some deliverables. As things opened and some restrictions removed, we have had more success in getting survey information by hosting outdoor events. We are continuing to develop plans to have an engagement at Santa Rite Jail and Alameda County Juvenile Facility. We have opened our members to give feedback and what their expectations are for Black Men Speak, Inc. \u0003 Box F: Program lessons learned of the past year? Note: 1,000 -character limit. We adapted to a new way of fulfilling our deliverables by using Zoom, for our program to continue in uncertain health and social situations by providing information and being available to our members, and our community as a positive force. By continuing our relationships with like organizations such as All of Us or None, POCC, BOP, REACH, and Boss we have continued to increase visibility of BMS and empowerment in target populations in different ways. Through BMS presentations we have seen much support of men released from incarceration including employment, housing, and self -sufficiency in the current Quarter we have not had to use Zoom to do our deliverables as many places have opened up as we provided our services outside.

Note: 1,000 -character limit. In FY 21 -22 AAFOP conducted five outreach workshops on Zoom for African American families. The program successfully achieved a record 60% participant evaluation survey response. Results indicated that an average of 98% of the respondents were adult/older -adult and an average of 82% of the respondents identified as Black or African American. The success of the five workshops was reflected: 98% of respondents found the presentations useful: a participant commented: \"I really enjoyed the Workshop and there was a lot of content I did not know.\" An average of 100% of respondents found the presenters w ere accessible and had skillfully answered questions. An average of 98% of respondents rated the registration process a 9+ out of 10 (best experience); a n average of 98% of the respondents rated the overall workshop 9+ out of 10 (best experience). The prog ram was highly successful in garnering community feedback which informed choice of presenters and was shared with ACBH. Box E: Program challenges of the past year and how did the agency mitigate challenges? Note: 1,000 - character limit. The program implemented a re -design in 2022 with the goal of enhancing the warmth and safety of the workshops. An \"I see you\" grounding piece and a poetry reading were added to each workshop. A clinician was piloted in the February workshop. She held a breakout suppor t room for participants who desired consultation on current issues. Although our total workshop attendance did not change from FY 2020 -21, we felt challenged by promoting the workshops. To mitigate this, the program hired a local African American PR Firm t o promote the February 5th workshop. The result of this promotion increased the average workshop attendance (33 participants) by 57%. Although this solution was successful, we found it not sustainable due to cost. We anticipate this outreach issue will be mitigated by the increased staffing for the program in FY 2022 -23. Finally, the program was challenged in attracting a gender diverse participant cohort across the year. We look forward to mitigating this in FY 2022 -23. Box F: Program lessons learned of the past year? Note: 1,000 -character limit. The program learned that the efforts we implemented (at the end of quarter 2) to make the zoom workshop a positive experience for participants were successful (98% zoom high satisfaction rate from evaluations). A second lesson learned came from our pilot of including a clinician during the February workshop for urgent consultations. 5% of attendees utilized this resource. The clinician reported the strategy was not effective: no crises were brought forward. We learned that a re- thinking of our use of the clinician is needed. We also learned that the community is very concerned about the grievance process for their loved ones, especially for those living in licensed Board and Care residences. AAFOP wi ll partner with the MHAAC Grievance program to address this in FY 2022 -23. Finally, we learned that across the year, 42% of our participants had loved ones living with both MI and SUD. We will address this need in FY 2022 - 23.

Note: 1,00 0-character limit. Despite the impact of Covid 19 on the mental, physical, and emotional well -being of RJOY Circle participants we were able to engage them through events and discussions that explored the range of responses to issues they currently face. During events partic ipants often expressed joy and optimism for the future, while they may have felt differently months or weeks prior. In addition, for participants living in racially marginalized bodies, the circles offer a place of safety and belonging. For example, we had a successful Youth Circle with EOYDC that created a space for young people to express themselves through art and restorative justice. They looked forward to spending time with us each week. The structure provided a space to express challenges particular t o young people and personal conflicts. The Circle was led by RJOY youth leaders and supported by adult staff. Box E: Program challenges of the past year and how did the agency mitigate challenges? 1,000 - character limit. Circle participants continue to express feeling isolated and overwhelmed by the pandemic, community violence, housing, and food insecurity. We have been able to cast a wide net for outreach virtually. Some participants are eager to gather in person, while others remain hesitant. To be st support mental health and social needs, we share resources and information through emails, social media, and community bulletins. We also partner with Black led organizations. For example, we have utilized the poll, question, and insert link feature on Instagram to connect with the community and direct them to the RJOY website along with Circle descriptions. Staff frequently attend Instagram and Twitter livestreams. Box F: Program lessons learned of the past year? Note: 1,000 -character limit. Participants who have attended RJOY Circles, events, and trainings feel connected to the organization and each other. In addition, they are often interested in leading and supporting restorative Circles engaged in Indigenous and Africentric forms of healin g. Furthermore, participants want and need strategies for self -development and healing to break generational patterns and interrupt community violence. Through participant feedback we have learned that despite the systemic and technological challenges, the re is a deep yearning to connect. Participants express continued interest in ancestral healing and developing strategies to address mental health and trauma in their daily lives. In combination with healing circles, participants receive holistic care that addresses mental health, food insecurity, and other pressing needs. Providing these resources gives participants a better outlook on life and illustrates the possibilities for positive outcomes.

Box E: Program challenges of the p ast year and how did the agency mitigate challenges? Note: The box has a 1,000 -character limit. The primary challenge we continue to experience during the year involved adapting working with our mini grant recipients to modify their original project plans to develop a hybrid virtual platform and process for accomplishing initial goals to impact their targeted community. Working with our Grantees we developed a parallel in person platform that will launch per County guideline s. We also experienced some challenges balancing the congregational trainings & community responses to the COVID 19 vaccine hesitancy within the African American Community and the surge experienced between December '21 and January'22. We are currently pla nning a Hybrid Mental Health 101 for both North and South County with the intention to pilot congregational models throughout the county. We successfully worked with two of our MHFC partners to host hybrid anti stigma events during the year! Box F: Prog ram lessons learned of the past year? Note: 1,000 -character limit. Flexibility is essential to respond to the very fluid landscape caused by COVID 19 restrictions and guidelines. We have worked very closely with each MHFC Congregation to implement strategies that are unique to their faith community and accessible to the larger MHFC Community. Each faith community's capacity to implement virtual platforms for their congregants and community varies. The smaller congregations are more limited than th e larger congregations. We are working with each faith center to assure that each can maximize resources, access information to bridge the challenges of social distancing and shelter in place guidelines. Additionally, there was a growing need to address the mental health implications raised by social justice issues, policing in the Black Community amidst the political landscape of a \"Post Trump\" America.

Note: 1,000 -character limit. The response to the mental health support and education the program offers was enthusiastic among both church leadership and congregation members. The Hope & Faith advisory board had in -depth discussions around the benefits to faith communities of addressing Black mental health from strength - based and non -stigmatizing perspectives, making connections between spirituality and mental health. PEERS worked with four new churches, so that we could bring the anti -stigma work to new African American faith communities. We were pleased to have forged new partnerships with the following churches: Christian Community Church of California, Ebenezer Missionary Baptist Church, Imani Community Church, and Memorial Tabernacle Church. Box E: Program challenges of the past year and how did the agency mitigate challenges? Note: 1,000 - character limit. The primary challenge was making contacts with churches new to the Hope & Faith campaign at the beginning of the year. Given the intense challenges of the pandemic, for some churches, the timing was not right for engaging with the campaign: some churches simply were overwhelmed, some had been fully occupied by returning to in person services, and others saw declines in participation during the time they were operating remotely. Our primary strategies for mitigating this challenge were persistence in outreach and mobilizing the deep community connections of PEERS' Hope & Faith staff leaders. We are proud that we were able to increase from three churches to four during this challenging time. Box F: Program lessons learned of the past year. Note: 1,000 - character limit. The clearest lesson that emerged from the Hope & Faith Campaign this past year is that the campaign's success is dependent upon staff who have deep personal connections in African American faith communities. The PEERS staff who work on this program, who have lived experience as Black people with mental health challenges, have longstanding, trusting networks in these communities, and were able to draw on those networks to forge relationships with new churches.

Note: 1,000 -character limit. Our Older & Out groups have continued to be a dynamic virtual offering to the community, consistently offering a meaningful service. We implemented some changes to the design, responding to the desire of many group members to have deeper conversations during group as well as have access to social spaces. Other design changes addressed our need for continuity within the group facilitator role, filled by our clinicians -in-training. An example of the strong connections being made through the group experien ce as well as the accessibility brought by utilizing virtual platforms, is apparent in one of our groups, in which a member, in his 80's, is being treated for a cancer with a very poor prognosis. He continues to attend despite frequent moves (hospital, reh ab, assisted living). Some group members and PC staff phone him regularly and a co -facilitator made an in -person visit to him. He continues to participate as best he can as a valued member of the group, reducing his isolation and grief. Box E: Program challenges of the past year and how did the agency mitigate challenges? Note: 1,000 -character limit. To be expected, some challenges were influenced by the pandemic. For example, still unable to meet in-person, we responded by continuing to offer our Older & Out service virtually. Since our program design relies on our clinicians -in-training to facilitate the groups, we were faced with a challenge when none were able to continue after their training year ended. This prompted us to pause the services fo r a month and return with 9 -12-week segments of closed sessions. Our intention is to contact the new trainees at the start of their training year to recruit them to Older & Out. This way there will be increased continuity and consistency as well as creatin g an opportunity for safer space more conducive to deep conversation and connection. If another ethnicity is counted, please specify: 1 Peruvian, 2 Jewish Box F: Program lessons learned of the past year? Note: 1,000 -character limit. As we work to weave Older & Out in with our training program for mental health clinicians, we are learning how to bolster the strengths brought forward and support the areas needed to be strengthened. Our hope is that more of the group facilitators will stay on after th e training year ends, giving more continuity to the program, and more support for the new trainees entering, thereby creating a more consistent experience for the group members. Another lesson learned is that the Older & Out group members desire social spa ces outside of the therapy sessions. On their own, they have invited each other to socialize in -person outside and one member has offered to hold a virtual social space when group has been on a pause. We made changes to the job descriptions for the Peer Specialist position to accommodate this need.

Note: 1,000 -character limit. Opportunities for outreach have increased dramatically. It's exciting to get back out connecting with others. We keep utilizing our website as well as our Meetup, Instagram, and Facebook accounts. We continue to offer, through our Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion initiatives, quarterly DEI training . The peer group facilitators showed up with fair attendance to the three DEI trainings provided: Intersectionality, Addressing Microaggressions and Communication Skill -Building. Though our groups remain virtual, participants have expressed that our ability to hold space has given them connection and they've \"found the group understanding and supportive and makes [them] feel [they are] not alone on an island\". We have also received requ ests to start new groups and restart groups that have paused, like our Thursday Night Men's Group. Box E: Program challenges of the past year and how did the agency mitigate challenges? Note: 1,000 -character limit. Only one of our peer groups at the San Leandro Senior Center has moved back to in -person meetings. We noticed that some of our community members who left groups when we moved online, have returned to this space. Unfortunately, due to gentrification, the Pacific Center's space is in transiti on, and we are unsure when we may be able to transition back to in -person meetings at our home. This is hard because some of our facilitators, are experiencing Zoom fatigue and online groups has increased the amount of communication they have to engage in via emails and reminders. Also, some groups would like to be hybrid. That will require PC to engage in major technological upgrades. In addition to physical transitions, during FY22 -23, Pacific Center experienced leadership changes in the Executive Directo r, Clinical Director, Finance Director, and Community Programs Director positions. These shifts impacted staff capacity and some schedule changes. Box F: Program lessons learned of the past year? Note: 1,000 -character limit. Moving forward, Pacific Center is onboarding new peer facilitators to allow some facilitators to rotate out or step back to prevent burn out. We also noted that a few groups have been dealing with crisis situations amongst group members and we are scheduling training with our Clinical Director to provide our facilitators with resources. One area of note is crisis services for our Latinx/Spanish - speaking population. We have identified a gap in crisis services for our Latinx community members in their home language and we ar e looking at how we can partner with CBOs to ensure that they can support communities who sit at the intersection of the LGBTQIA and Latinx identities, including prioritizing bilingual clinicians in our training program. To address the need for increased outreach, the community programs and operations staff meet monthly to boost our public outreach, especially to our community members who live at intersections of disabled, trans, and BIPOC communities.

Community Based Organizations are maintaining and increasing interest in deeper, more intersectional, integrative learning as it relates to culturally responsive service delivery. Qualitative feedback indicates that participants found the trainings and information shared to be relevant and helpful to their work. In Q3 & Q4, we offered 22 didactic trainings and community stakeholders have expressed increased interest in attending Pac ific Center trainings. Our trainings have also drawn participants from other local academic institutions and clinical training programs. Evaluation participation has also increased providing invaluable feedback to our program with respondents noting that P C trainings have increased their scope and given them better understanding of LGBTQIA issues.

While COVID -19 infections continue to ebb and flow, with the return of our Mental Health at the Intersections conference as a hybrid experience, we are looking into how Pacific Center can offer and deepen our practice to see what is possible as we embark on the next cycle of CBO trainings. Also, as we think of hybrid options for training, Pacific Center is assessing what technological upgrades will be necessary for more effective delivery of services. We have received feedback that our pay rates for trainers should be increased especially for BIPOC trainers who are in high demand. In terms of our program design, PC is looking into how our trainings can further reach the community. We have identified a gap in crisis services for our Latinx community members in their home language and we are looking at how we can partner with CBOs to ensure that they can support communities who sit at the intersection of the LGBTQIA and Latinx identities.

Box E: Program challenges of the past year and how did the agency mitigate challenges? Note: 1,000 - character limit. We noticed that students who had been with the agency for several years and who were aging out were apprehensive with their next chapter in life and in leaving the program. We had a student who reached 26 but was still benefiting from our resources. The goal was to ensure that students felt equipped and prepared to utilize the skills gained from their time here and Downtown TAY. I created a Transition plan for this participant and participants who may feel the same in the future. The plan consisted of a 30 -day time period after turning 26 in which a TAY will focus on ensuring they are utilizing their time and the agency's resources, to ensure they have all of their needs met . Box F: Program lessons learned of the past year? Note: 1,000 -character limit. We have learned that TAY students are increasingly interested in finding new activities that will keep them productive and engaged especially during this pandemic resurgence. With schools and activities finding different ways of engaging with students, we mus t be creative in our approach with introducing curriculum in an interesting way. It is also vital to work around the busy schedules of the youth. We have realized that our evening sessions that are after school hours are the most popular. We may have to investigate finding new activities outside of the traditional work hours.

Note: 1,000 -character limit. Black Women's Media has been successful in maintaining great participation from the community. Whether the event is virtual or in -person there has been a favorable response and a clear indication that new community members are interested in our programming. With every small change made to programming, it has been an improvement and there has been favorable feedback. The demand for more interpersonal activities has sparked the interest in starting a Facebook group for participants and creating a workbook to accompany our existing magazine. With just two Be still Retreats we have already reached over 100 community members. We have been able to collaborate with the B.H. Brilliant Minds Project and host an interactive wellness retreat which included wellness stations, face painting, writing workshop, Aromatherapy, and meditation. BWM has also received 5 new CAB members who are very connected to the community and interested in the promotion of mental health awareness of Black women. Box E: Program challenges of the past year and how did the agency mitigate challenges? Note: 1,000 -character limit. The program faced challenges in collecting survey responses following program activities. As most events were held online, there is little control on how quickly a participant will provide feedback. BWM moved its surveys to an online format and found a way to gather demographic data through the registration process. Through the registration process on Eventbrite, we were able to collect demographic information up front. During online events, feedback can be received through a Q&A session. Also , links to fee dback surveys were included in the chat, making it easy for participants to respond. So far, there has been an improvement. I believe with time the changes made will prove even more successful. Moving forward, BWM will continue to collect data in a way tha t is not daunting for participants. Here is the link to our current book club and retreat survey: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/BMSVLKQ and https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/988SF9V . Box F: Program lessons learned of the past year? Note: 1,000 -character limit. For the past six months, flexibility and planning has been the key. With flexibility, it 's important to be able to meet the needs of the community from their perspective. There had been an interest to slowly incorporate in person progr am activities and we were able to meet that request safely. For those who preferred to remain virtual, most of the programming remained online. Adequate planning to produce great programming had been the most instrumental. BWM was easily continued in the brief absence of its program manager. Due to the dynamic programming previously scheduled and the purposeful selection of speakers who are invested in the work that HHREC and BWM are doing, a community has been established and our network has furnished a l itany of fresh programming. With a clear foundation of program goals already set, activities were easily executed.

Innovations Programs are not designed to support existing or ongoing programs or services, but rather to provide the mental health system with innovative demonstration projects that will support system change in order to increase access to services and improve client/consumer outcomes. An Innovation Project may introduce a novel, and/o r ingenious approach to a variety of mental health practices. Innovation Projects can contribute to learning at any point across the spectrum of an individual or family's needs relating to mental health, from prevention and early intervention to recovery s upports which includes supportive housing. An Innovative Project must meet the following criteria: 1. It is new, meaning it has not previously been done in the mental health field; Innovation Projects must promote new approaches to mental health in one or mor e of the following ways: Introducing a new mental health practice or approach, or Adapting an existing mental health practice or approach, so that it can serve a new target population or setting, or modifying an existing practice or approach from another field, to be used for the first time in mental health. 2. It has a learning component, which will contribute to the body of knowledge about mental health. The learning component is represented in the application's Learning Question. Before INN funds can be spent on an INN project, the project idea must be vetted through a 30 -day public review process, approved by the County Board of Supervisors and then approved by the Mental Health Services Oversight and Accountability Commission (MHSOAC).

Alameda County is fortunate to be located on these front lines of technology. The County's unique location in the Ba y Area provides residents close proximity to not only Silicon Valley, but numerous other technology companies, big, small, and emerging. This parity provides the County with a community that tends to embrace new technology with enthusiasm. Mobile apps that focus on mental health can be used for a variety of purposes. They show great promise in promoting healthy behavior changes, increasing adherence to treatment programs, providing immediate psychological support, facilitating self -monitoring and reducing t he demand for clinician time .1 As mobile applications grow in popularity among the general public, so does the potential to increase the quality of care and access to evidence -based treatments through this technology. Trauma is a deeply distressing or disturbing experience. Many traumas arise from a brief encounter/experience, or it can last for months, even years because of an individual's set of circumstances. The County, through community input through its 2017 Commu nity Program Planning Process, focused on the trauma created by a number of specific factors that are currently affecting its residents. These factors are: 1) Role of caregivers due to a result of an increasing shift of psychiatric care to the community supplemented by an ever -aging population; 2) Physical violence and gun violence; 3) Rising rate of suicide especially in youth, transitional age youth, and older men; and 4) Influx of immigrants, asylees, and refugees into the County. Furthermore, each of these factors overlap with each other: caregivers slipping into major depression may feel suicidal ideation or become violent towards the person they are caring for; or suicide among refugees and asylee youth because of feelings of there's no way out.2 1 https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy -lifestyle/stress -management/in ngly self -harming and attempting suicide | MSF Child refugees in Lesbos are increasingly self-harming and attempting suicide | MSFhttps://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/in-depth/support-groups/art-20044655INNOVATION669 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG This two and half years (2.5) project ended June 30, 2022 after a seven (7) month extension. This project's intention was to provide a platform for individuals who reside in isolation, anonymity, or feel they have no place to go because of their situation. This project was about offering new opportunities for outreach, and engagement, and support to the communities listed be low by testing a technology -based delivery system for mental health solutions. There were five (5) grantees who created mental health mobile apps for four (4) identified populations. Of the five (5) grantees, two (2) of them are doing a single identified population while the remaining three (3) are doing multiple populations. The identified populations and the awarded grantees, Diversity in Health Training Institute (DHTI); Korean Community Center of the East Bay (KCCEB); Mental Health Association for Chin ese Communities (MHACC); NAMI; and Niroga Institute, are listed below with their respective targeted population and their website or presentation video .

ACBH notified MHSOAC that the county will be extending the project (no -cost extension) until June 30, 2022. After this expiration, MHSA was able to secure funding from MHSA's Prevention and early Intervention (PEI) funding for a one (1) year contract . The project will be under the purvey of P EI for fiscal year 2022 -2023. Before this funding ends, MHSA will reevaluate if PEI funding remains to be the most appropriate funding stream or if the applications can be sustained under C ommunity Services and Supports (CSS). As the pilot has drawn to a close, evaluation of the project's intended outcomes has been completed. it was not an easy task to develop good mental health focused apps . The subjects of the apps , individuals who are suffering with mental health issues, are subjects that are even more sensitive to the DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG populations identified in the grantees ' pilots (i.e. Chinese caregivers ; Korean business owners ). The intended outcomes included: 1. Decreased internalized stigma; 2. Increased empowerment; 3. Increased quality of life (QOL) 4. Enhance social connectedness; and 5. Increased mental health recovery. Although there was varied results depending upon the grantee 's targeted population and their developer, overall, outcomes were positive. However, the intended outcomes could not always be readily be gleaned by all evaluations . The ability to answer questions regarding how the apps affected mental health help seeking behaviors was difficult to ascertain due to a number of barriers. Not surprisingly, the pandemic created a number of unforeseeable barriers to the project. The pandemic made it difficult for outreach; staff or staff family becoming ill with covid ; and the discovery of maintaining the projects culturally competen cy to name a few obstacles. Certainly, the idea of what an opportunity the pandemic w as also giving the project was discussed: the world shutting down and the main connection to other people or resources was through technology. Here, the project was creating mental health technology to help people seeking mental health assistance. Although , this was an opportunity that everyone attempted to use to their advantage , one individual user commented that they did not want to use DHTI's online network because they did not want to connect with someone during covid. Whether this individual was under the impression that only in person resources were being touted is unknown. Another individual commented they did not realize the site was live because it had been referred to as a pilot. It is clear from these comments , that in the future , more precise l anguage is required for everyone's understanding. Other challenges involved the expected reliance on external vendors versus in-house expertise. One grantee changed their app developer three times because the grantee was not satisfied with the developers understanding of the grantee's vision of their app. Implementation delays were mostly beyond grantee's controls due to the inability of a developer to understand needs of the project . The grantees who were designing non- English options within their app, a nd were working with English language app developers , found it difficult because it required the organization playing the cultural expert rol e. Playing this role created an even greater burden in design and educating the designer on cultural aesthetics on look and feel ...we did not realize the extent of our staff resources and time that would be required to meet design needs from a cultural...perspective. The evaluations demonstrated that the apps are well -designed and easy to use . This is not to say that design and development of the apps was easy. As mentioned, p rogress of the design and development of the apps proved to be more challenging to the grantee than originally perceived . Comments from users described the installation pr ocess was easy and straightforward. Privacy options, which was a high priority, were described as satisfactory and easy to understand. There were several suggested improvements and observations from the evaluation : Effective dissemination strategies mig ht include broad public information campaigns targeting entire communities of interest, as well as targeting key opinion leaders within the communities of interest that can effectively spread information about the resource to all corners of their community ; INNOVATION671 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Add some functions, such as allowing caregiver to communicate with the one he or she care about via the apps; Add more peer support options; The app developer should have a linguistic and cultural knowledge of the app's targeted population; There was a lot of staff time that was not originally budgeted so overestimating for staffer time should have a higher valuation ; Additional time should have been buffered because t he IRB review can be time consuming with its long wait tim e; and The app d evelopment process would have been substantially easier and more efficient had more funding that reflected the true cost of the project with top -tier app developers. A few of the grantees have expressed interest in interlacing apps together which would enable collaboration for maximum user impact. The exploration for these partnerships will be done within the next fiscal year during its support through PEI. PRO JECT NAME: COMMUNITY ASSESSMENT TREATMENT TEAM (CATT) Project Description: Alameda County's existing system for responding to behavioral health crises in the community is inefficient in terms of expense, time and connecting clients to appropriate services. A v ast majority of transports for individuals on a psychiatric hold are conducted by ambulance, which is expensive and requires law enforcement to wait for an ambulance to arrive. These calls are lower priority since they are generally not life -threatening, t herefore increasing the wait time. In addition, the existing system transports an individual who qualifies for a 5150 involuntary hold, but those who do not qualify are left on site without a connection to services. The goal of CATT is to im prove access to services in Alameda County by combining efforts to significantly transform the response to behavioral crises in the community . The CATT program is using a mobile crisis transport staffing model that accesses technological sup port to enable the CATT program to connect clients to a wider and more appropriate array of services. The CATT team consists of: A licensed mental health clinician who is teamed up with an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) in an unmarked vehicle specially designed for the CATT team. Together, this team can provide mental and physical assessment to individuals in crisis and transport them to appropriate services required in the moment; and Technology supports, ReddiNet, are used to identify current availabi lity of beds and Community Health Records to provide the most accurate information about the client's physical and mental health history. By bringing together the right staffing and the right technology, this innovative crisis response team s' goals are to reduce unnecessary 5150 holds, transportation to medical facilities for medical clearance, and the many hours of waiting for clients and first responders. In addition, the goal to increase access to appropriate services by connecting and transporting cl ients whether or not they are on a 5150 hold. In the second year of the CATT program there were 1,185 requests for a CATT team response. A CATT team provided services to 758 clients (64% of all calls). Of the 758 clients served, 465 (62%) resulted in a INNOVATION672 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG transport. Approximately 40 CATT responses per month avoid what would likely have been an unnecessary hospital transportation 5150 involuntary hold . The second -year evaluation final report has been completed by the CATT project evaluator, Public Consulting Group (PCG). A report brief was created by PCG and can be found in the appendix. The brief contains highlights and summary of the CATT program background and overview; process eval uation findings; outcome evaluation findings; response, transport, and involuntary hold dispositions; and program recidivism. CATT Summary of Challenges and Resolution s As with any pilot project, challenges continue to arise as new ideas are tested or challenges that were not anticipated arise. The following challenges are being addressed with resolutions : 1. Staff Hiring and Retention has been an ongoing challenge throughout the project. A number of process improvements have been made to hiring and retention. \"CATT leadership collaborated to design clear requirements and expectations for the field employee positions, which has led to an increase in applications. \" Enhancements added to hiring include: a. Salary Increase ; b. Sign-On Bonus ; c. Holiday Pay ; d. Paid Time Off ; and e. Clinical Supervision 2. Training Academy and Professional Development have had a number of changes to the two (2) week training academy all field employees must complete before they can be responding to calls on a CATT team. In addition to virtual trainings, Crisis Intervention Training ( CIT Training) provided by Oakland Police Department; and one (1) day of field training with experienced CATT teams these trainings were added: a. Training topics related to documentation, self -care, and policy and procedure overviews to better support staff; and b. Community Organization for Drug Abuse Control (CODAC) de -escalation and basic maneuver training is taught to all field CATT responders. 3. Policy and Procedure changes include: a. Response time change requirement from 20 to 30 minutes (completed) ; b. Hiring ass ociate social workers working towards licensing (completed); c. Updating CATT clinician documentation system and requirements (in progress); and d. Alignment of Bonita House CARF (Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities) Standards for accredit ation to bill to private insurance (in progress). 4. CATT Program Collaborators have noted a number of improvements to collaboration in the second year of the CATT pilot. There have been barriers to collaboration since launching the pilot. However, many interviewees have noted they feel the program is finally gaining momentum in a forward direction especially since positive results in program outcomes are being seen. Despi te challenges that have arisen and/or continue to persist , all CATT pilot interview participants agree that the \"CATT program is a vital countrywide behavioral health services that is necessary for the ongoing care and support of the community and behavior al health system .\" INNOVATION673 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG PROJECT NAME : Supportive Housing Community Land Alliance ( SHCLA) Across the Bay Area, an inadequate supply of housing stock, particularly affordable housing, has contributed to rising home prices, rental rates, evictions, displacement and homelessness. Over the past five years, there have been significant declines in the number of licensed board and care facilities, residential hotels, and room and board facilities frequently utilized by in dividuals living on fixed incomes. Individuals with severe mental illness living on fixed Social Security disability incomes experience some of the greatest challenges in finding and maintaining housing in this region. Project Description: The Supportive Housing Community Land Alliance ( SHCLA ) (aka CLA; Land Trust; Land Trust Program ), is based on a community land trust model, is a nonprofit, community -based organization designed to ensure community stewardship of land. Community land trusts are often associated with conservation efforts. However, the significant effort to ensure affordable long -term housing through this form of ownership is the SHCLA's mission. The SHCLA will acquire land and maintain ownership of it permanently. The SHCLA will enter into long- term, renewable leases with residents. If the resident leaves, the resident earns a portion of the increased property value. The remainder is kept by the trust, preserving the affordability and purpose of the property for future households. The proposed Innovation Project is promoting interagency collaboration in order for the Alameda County Supportive Housing Community Land Alliance to develop and maintain supportive housing units. ACBH will be partner ing with Alameda County Housing and C ommunity Development Department, housing and real estate legal and financial experts, consumer/client representatives, family member representatives, and existing nonprofit affordable housing developers to develop a land trust focused on supportive housing that incorporates unique aspects in order to address local conditions. The SHCLA began its anticipated partnership with the Office of Homeless Care and Coordination (OHCC) in July 2022. Th e project's grantee, Northern California Land Trust (NCLT) was given a seven (7) month no-cost extension until December 31, 2022 in order to support the project until it received its determination letter from the IRS making the SHCLA a fully recognized 501(c) (3) non- profit entity . The extension expiration will pa rallel the departure of th e subject matter expert, Burlington Associates, whose contractual expiration will also be December 31, 2022. Although both of these important supporting parties are departing the project, the new entity, SHCLA, will enter into it s own standard service agreement to complete the remaining two (2) years of the project. SHCLA Summary of Challenges and Resolution The Supportive Housing Community Land Alliance team has been working since Oc tober, 2020 . Currently the SHCLA has been incorporated and filed its Form 1023, Application for Recognition of Exemption Under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRS) in December, 2021 . The Form 1023 is used by the I RS to issue a determination letter or ruling letter that recognizes an organization's exemption from federal income tax. This is a final step for SHCLA to become a full - fledged non -profit entity enabling th e county to contract with SHCLA directly . This determination letter from the IRS did take much longer than anticipated. The IRS, who governs this type of determination, has been greatly behind schedule on these types of requests. However, SHCLA received its determination letter in October, 2022 . Since non- profit status is approved, SHCLA intends to file the Board of Equalization's Welfare Exemption form BOE -277. This claim form INNOVATION674 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG filed by a non -profit organization, seeks th e welfare exemption from the count y assessor, to request the issuance of an organizational clearance certificate to the organization. This clearance provides SHCLA tax exemption and the ability to purchase property and services under non -profit status. The Advisory Committee began the project very strong with up to fifteen members. Since the previous plan update, many members have fulfilled their one (1) year commitment and have exited. The departure of many founding Advisory Committee members has left the committee with less than five (5) members. SHCLA executive director and NCLT have done a recrui tment push and been successful. Although the Advisory Committee has yet to reach its previous heights , recruitment continues to seek out new members. There have also been several board of directors who have resign ed including the board president . These resignations have been due to personal reasons or to align the board membership in accordance to county regulations. Currently, there are a number of individuals being engaged to fulfill thes e positions . Procurement of a project evaluator has been completed. The evaluator's contractual agreement will run concurrently with the remaining time of the project which concludes December , 2024. The evaluator and the county are currently in contractual negotiations. The project's next steps include p lans on strategic partnership to acquire properties with non - profits that are buying property, serving clients with SMI and delivering supportive services. There is continued pursuit to make request for inf ormation from organization to facilitate various models of partnership with existing organization for the SHCLA's prototype. Additionally, a request for Capital Facilities and Technological Needs (CFTN) funding has been included in this plan update. The C FTN funding was identified in SHCLA's approved proposal to assist in purchas ing board and care(s) . Refer to the CFTN section for more information on MHSA's request for funding. PROJECT N AME : Community Program Planning Process (CPPP) Project Description: Alameda County Behavioral Health (ACBH) continues to be fully invested in having a dynamic community process that is inclusive of all community with the County. Community involvement from the residents of the county is essential to Innovation planning and program development. ACBH has had challenges in its outreach to many of its diverse populations. These challenges include outreach and engagement to unserved and underserved individuals in both urban and rural areas. The County is dedicated to developing a revitalized and improved approach to ensure more meaningful input from all individuals living in the county. The Community Project Planning Process (CPPP) occur s every three (3) years as per MHSA Innovation regulations. Alameda County's 3-Year CPPP was held between October - December , 2022 for community input for its MHSA 3-Year Plan Update FY2023 -2026.

It is more likely that an individual will be booked into jail than be engaged in treatment thus creating jails as large mental health institutions. The two forensic proposals were born out of Alameda County Behavioral Health Services and Forensic System R edesign Plan Update , May, 20214. The two innovation plans , Peer -led Continuum of Forensic Services and Alternative to Confinement Continuum of Services , arose out of the county's efforts to divert individuals with mental health challenges from the justice system into mental health services . Both of these innovation plans were developed for and by community stakeholders, including the County's Justice Involved Mental Health Task Force. 1. Peer -led Continuum of Forensic Services The Peer -led Continuum of Foren sic Services is a collection of four (4) components : Reentry Coaches, WRAP for Reentry, Forensic Peer Respite, and Family Navigation and Support . Three are peer -led and one is family focused. The project specifically seeks to : Support mental health consum ers who are justice involved by helping them transition back into the community following an arrest or incarceration ; Identify and address the issues that led up to their arrest and/or incarceration, and connect with mental health and other services to sup port them in their recovery and reentry journey ; and Seeks to build the capacity of family members to advocate on behalf of their loved one with a serious mental illness who has become justice involved. As a result of the continuum of services, we expect that individuals will experience fewer episodes of arrest and/or incarceration and will have increased participation in ongoing mental health and other services. 2. Alternatives to Confinement Continuum of Forensic Services The Alternatives to Incarce ration Continuum of Forensic Services is a collection of three (3) services that work together and are intended to prevent incarceration and divert individuals from criminal justice system into mental health services. These services are Forensic Crisis Res idential Treatment, Arrest Diversion/Triage Center, and Reducing Probation/Parole Violations. This continuum of care specifically seeks to divert individual from incarceration when: A mental health consumer who is forensically involved begins to exhibit early warning signs of a crisis with behaviors that may lead to police contact ; At the moment of police contact that may result in arrest, and The person has fallen out of compliance with their probation or parole and is subject to re - arrest. 4http://www.acgov.org/board/bos_calendar/documents/DocsAgendaReg_5_10_21/HEALTH%20CARE%20SERVICE S/Regular%20Calendar/Item__1_ACBH_Services_Forensic_sys_5_10_21.pdf 4 http://www.acgov.org/board/bos_calendar/documents/DocsAgendaReg_5_10_21/HEALTH%20CARE%20SERVICES/Regular%20Calendar/ Item__1_ACBH_Services_Forensic_sys_5_10_21.pdfINNOVATION677 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Using models from mental health and other disciplines, these three interventions collectively provide an opportunity to divert forensic mental health consumers from police contact that may result in being detained, from being arrested or booked into the jail if detained, and from being re -arrested if unable to comply with the terms and conditions of their release. These priorities for diversion arose out of the sequential intercept mapping process with Alameda County's Justice Involved Mental Health Task Force and focus on preventing entry into the criminal justice system as well as promoting exit from the criminal justice system . The proposals for the Peer -led and the Alternative to Confinement forensic continuums of care are listed in the Appendix. 3. Consumer Empowerment Using C T-R (Recovery -Oriented Cognitive Therapy) Summary The consumer empowerment proposal originally came out of the County's Community Program Planning Process (CPPP) meetings during February - May 2020 identifying Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) as the training mental health approach. During a larger webinar focus group, DBT online training was presented as an idea for uplifting peers. The webinar included stakeholders, and the County's Peer s Organizing Community Change (POCC , and formerly known as Pool of Consumer Champions) agreed that this would be a good pilot project to support. However , in the spring and summer of 2022, it was decided to change the treatment approach that would be taugh t online from DBT to Recovery -Oriented Cognitive Therapy (CT -R). The change was brought forth because CT -R allows clients to find their own through life's challenges while in recovery. Peers have an intimate understanding to these challenges and are well-suited to learn CT -R skills. The CT -R project will develop an online Recovery -Oriented Cognitive Therapy (CT -R) Peer to Peer training program to train peers with the skills of CT -R. This program is to provide new skills as peers enhance their hire abilit y and increase their skills as peers when practicing within peer to peer groups. ACBH wishes to provide a learning environment that is removed from restrictive time and space. An online training program is able to provide an avenue that is self -paced, reco very -oriented mode of learning for peers to cultivate relationships with others committed to learning, practicing, educating others about, and building mastery of the CT -R skill sets . There are a number of ideals that coincide with the peer recovery philo sophy that make it an excellent fit with peers: CT-R focuses on empowering individuals with serious mental health conditions to live the life they want to be living; CT-R is grounded in the premise that recovery is possible for everyone no matter how long it may take; Implementation of CT -R can be utilized in either individual or group -based settings and especially useful in the treatment setting; CT-R is particularly applicable for people who would not engage in treatment due to mistrust, chronic institut ionalization, limited access to motivation, limited verbalization, or intensity of symptom presentation falls within the POCC's ideals of personhood: individuals in recovery are whole human beings and deserve removal of stigma and discrimination; and INNOVATION678 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG The shared human potential focused view of recovery and resiliency, CT -R, like mutual peer support, nurtures hope and empowers individuals with serious mental health conditions to actively experience the type of flourishing life they want to live.5 It is these parallels in philosophy that makes CT -R training to peers very appealing to refresh and broaden the skills of peer support specialists. At this time, CT -R continues to be vetted in the County's current CPPP. An in -depth proposal will be submitt ed in the next fiscal year plan update after community stakeholders have had sufficient time to review and comment during the CPPP. 5 These parallels were drawn from The Beck institute's website: https://beckinstitute.org/blog/what -is-recovery - oriented -cognitive -therapy -ct-r/ drawn from website: https://beckinstitute.org/blog/what-is-recovery-oriented- cognitive-therapy-ct-r/WORKFORCE EDUCATION & TRAINING679 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG WORKFORCE EDUCATION AND TRAININGWORKFORCE EDUCATION & TRAINING680 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Workforce Education and Training | \"EQUITY IN ACTION\" Workforce Education and Training (WET) develops a workforce for ACBH that is sufficient in size, diverse, and linguistically capable to deliver services and supports that are culturally responsive to clients and family members. Client Success Stor y Sharnell Smothers: Ohlone College Mental Health Advocacy Program Sharnell Smothers is one of the Ohlone Community College students who has participated in many of the behavioral/mental health career pipeline programs. We are inspired to share her achievements and success! \"When I enrolled at Ohlone Community College I chose Business Administration as my major due to my background in finance. I had also recently been diagnosed with depression. At the time I did not understand what the diagnosis meant for me; all I knew was that I could finally put a name to what I was experiencing. Like most people who have dealt with m ental health challenges, I faced a great deal of stigma. Many of my family & friends expected me to \"snap out\" of my symptoms. The stigma I was subjected to caused me to go into isolation which worsened my condition. It was not until my mental health start ed to affect my parenting that I decided to research my illness. Through research, I was able to gain a better understanding of my personal situation, which ultimately ignited my interest in Psychology, which I later changed my major to, as I was eager to learn more about behavioral health. In the Fall of 2020, I was fortunate enough to be accepted into Ohlone College's Mental Health Advocacy Program. It was here that I learned about the different dynamics of mental health. As an African American student, I identify the most with challenges that directly affect the African American community, such as being disproportionately impacted by the stigma associated with mental health. For my service -learning project I ran a campaign called Stamp Out Stigma; Seek support. I presented to a small group of UMOJA students. One of my main goals was to educate my peers how to identify symptoms of mental illnesses so they know when it is time to seek or provide support. Shortly after, I was accepted into the Mental Heal th Equity Scholars program. It was in this program that I was exposed to the mental health challenges of different people groups. I developed a sense of compassion for each group as I could easily identify with their struggles. I later became a Senior Stud ent Wellness Ambassador where I organized special projects for my peers at Ohlone. We teamed up with local agencies to connect students with resources. STEPUp Ohlone programs have been a driving force behind my desire to pursue a career in social work. Each program that I have participated in has greatly contributed to my professional growth. With Workforce Education and Training \"Equity In Action\"WORKFORCE EDUCATION & TRAINING681 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG everything I learned, I've always reverted it back to myself. I realized that not everyone struggling with their mental health can find the strength to do the r esearch for themselves. Many obstacles that may impact a person's mental health can be solved with the right resources. Therefore, it is my purpose as a future Social Worker to help improve the lives of others with the hope of reducing mental health issues . Presently, I am happy to say that I was recently accepted into the 2022/23 BASW program at San Francisco State University! My overall goal is to pursue an MSW and eventually become a Psychiatric Social Worker. As a single parent, I am so grateful to be receiving the Alameda County Behavioral Health Career Pipeline scholarship. Receiving a scholarship that contributes directly to mental health heightens my motivation to make an impact in the field. I am also very thankful for the mentorship portion of the program as I believe having the guidance of a mentor throughout this journey will inspire me to remain on the path to achieving my goals. Thank you for this life -changing opportunity and for the positive impact the Ohlone Step -Up program has made i n my life.\" Client Success Story Prem Pariyar : Center for Empow ering Refugee s and Immigrants (CERI) Prem Pariyar is originally from Nepal, and was one of CERI's Wellness in Action's first program participants. He holds a Bachelor's degree in Education from Nepal and completed his MSW at Cal State East Bay in 2021. He is now working full -time as an Associate Mental Health Clinician at Hume Center, providing mental health services to Nepali and other South Asian communities. Prem is also an active Nepali community member and an advocate against caste -based discrimination. This is his success story : \"When I first arrived to the United States in 2015 seeking asylum from caste -based persecution, I worked in many kinds of service jobs. Not long after, I heard about a program called Richmond Leadership Institute, thanks to community leader Anupama Chapag ain, Wellness in Action (WIA) program manager. At that time, I had the opportunity to work with Patricia, WIA co -founder. When Wellness in Action launched in the Fall of 2016, I was very motivated to apply. There were two other Nepali participants in the program, and we understood firsthand the stigma surrounding mental health in Nepal. We decided to hold a focus group to learn more from our community. It was very eye -opening, and was a launching point to do more! People became curious and engaged in the conversation. This was the first time that community leaders, academic partners, and many others from the Nepali community in the Bay Area came together to talk about mental health openly. WORKFORCE EDUCATION & TRAINING682 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG We discovered there was a gap in services in the Nepali communit y and began thinking of ways in which we could creatively address them. Wellness in Action supported our work, helped us develop community input questions, and taught us to strengthen facilitation skills. The experience with Wellness in Action was foundati onal for me. I began to grow as a community leader to serve my community at other organizations in different capacities. My desire to pursue a mental health career became stronger as I developed confidence in my abilities. I went on to complete a graduate degree in Social Work at California State University. It was at Cal State that I began advocacy work against caste -based discrimination, and my department adopted \"caste\" as a protected category. Not only that, but the Academic Senate passed the Caste Re solution unanimously! Hence, all 23 universities in the CSU system adopted caste as a protected category in the anti -discrimination policy, with many more universities discussing this too! I currently work at the Hume Center and with Equality Lab, an organ ization that fights caste -based stigma. I continue to be a passionate advocate to break down mental health stigma. I am also an elected delegate in the National Association of Social Workers from California and serve as the Human Relations Commissioner in Alameda County. Through this commission, I would like to bridge the gaps in the community through policy - the right policies matter for underrepresented communities. I continue to have higher education goals as well. Recently, I applied and was admitted to some doctoral programs in the Bay Area. Wellness in Action gave me the confidence to continue building my career and aspire to do more in this field. I had lost hope, but I became aware of many things thanks to Wellness in Action and the opportunities they offered me. What was key to my learning, development, and growth was that other Mental Health professionals came alongside me, giving me to the chance to work alongside people from other communities. This is not an experience I had in my own country; to be able to address stigma across caste systems. To this day, I carry the motto of Wellness in Action, \"When \"I\" becomes \"WE\", illness becomes wellness\" (Malcolm X).\" Client Success Story Gabriela Agula ir: Mental Health Navigator Program at Ohlone College Gabriela Agulair was a student participant at the Alameda County Behavioral Health Navigator Program at Ohlone College and is a current scholarship recipient of the Alameda County Behavioral Health Career Pipeline and Mentorship Program.

We are inspired to share her passionate story about \"Mental Health in My Hispanic Home: Breaking Generational Cycles \". \"Imagine coming home to your mom and asking her to do something you know she would never let you do, but you still ask. You f eel that knot in your stomach, and your voice starts to quiver. Growing up, this is how I - and many other Hispanic children and young adults I knew - felt when asking our parents for help with our mental health. When we're not feeling good, when we're fee ling depressed, or when we can't or don't want to get out of bed, our parents constantly remind us of their struggles. They remind us of how hard they've had it, and how they just snapped out of it, and we should be able to \"get over it , too\". That's precisely how for many of us, mental health was treated in our Hispanic homes. The unfortunate reality is that for many in the Hispanic community, there's no such thing as mental health or constructs for healthy family dynamics. That was my reality growing up as a Hispanic undocumented girl in California, living between low and middle -class households, around abuse, alcoholism, and abandonment. I had no idea for a long time what I was missing, and didn't even know about the existence of mental health services u ntil I met my middle school counselor. She was the main reason I began understanding my many struggles, reality, and circumstances. But to be honest, the inequities I experienced with limited resources and nearly impossible support due to the stigma in the Hispanic community around mental health were highly discouraging, and greatly delayed my ability to get the help I needed even when I learned of the resources available. Fast fo rward to today: I am 37 years old, a mother of three, still unable to qualify for affordable medical care, and mental health services available to me remain almost non -existent. I am able to receive a few sessions per semester at my college, and after that , it's back to the system that also has limited resources. I decided to be part of the solution. While they haven't always completely understood mental health in the way I needed, my family has been a tremendous resource to me in adulthood and has always r einforced my resilience by reminding me of how strong I've been and how strong I should continue to be. And as important as that resilience is, I'm done with having that be the only support I allow myself, I'm done with the silence, and I'm done perpetuati ng this generational cycle around mental health. It's taken me a while to get here, but I'm ready to not only tell my children that it is okay not to be okay, but that it's okay to take a day off and be with your thoughts, mend your feelings, and tend to y our soul and needs. I'm ready to show them through example, vulnerability and truth. To think that I was not only traumatized by my own life experiences, but that I had also begun to subconsciously mirror the life that my mother had lived, experienced, and suffered was and is painful. Being an immigrant, a woman, and a mom to three kids, I can only imagine what she felt through her experiences. I know that a lot of my resilience and inquisitiveness to fight for injustice and equity for my community is roote d in the pain I saw in my mother's eyes, not knowing how to cope with life at times and dissociating from much of her trauma. I know that most of my desire and drive to pursue psychology and become a family and marriage therapist was because I always saw t he need for more Hispanic women to model positive mental health behaviors, especially to destigmatize the topic of mental health services. Life at times has led me down pat hways that might have derailed my career. Still, I know they have brought me to the right place in the end, and with the right mindset to move forward with the hope that I can make a difference and support other women, mothers, and immigrants to find heali ng.\" limited resources and nearly impossible support due to the stigma in the destigmatize the topic of mental health services.Hispanic communityWORKFORCE EDUCATION & TRAINING684 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG WORKFORCE, EDUCATION & TRAINING PROGRAM SUMMARIES Alameda County Behavioral Health (ACBH), Workforce Education & Training (WET) uses multiple strategies to build and expand behavioral health workforce capacity including: 1.

WORKFORCE EDUCATION & TRAINING686 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Alameda County work ed with CalMHSA on transitioning the ACLRP cycle 2 applicants into the WET RP round 1 of the Behavioral Health L oan Repayment Program (BHLRP) , in order to bring the ACLRP in alignment with the WET RP funding , program timeline , and other program requirements. Alameda County launched the State funded Behavioral Health Loan Repayment Program (BHLRP) round two application cycle from October 1 through November 30, 2022 . Recently t he date has been extended through December 15, 2022 as a result of a decision made at the RP Lead level in efforts to increase the volume of applications received. Every five years, OSHPD develops a WE T plan to address specific workforce needs. The State allocates funding to the five Regional Partnerships across California, including the Greater Bay Area Region based on the MHSA funding formula. The 2020 -2025 State Workforce Education and Training (WET) program aims to address the shortage of mental health practitioners in the public mental health systems (PMHS) through a framework that engages Regional Partnerships and supports individuals through five categories including: Pipeline Development, Loan Re payment Program, Undergraduate College and University Scholarships, Clinical Master and Doctoral Graduate education stipends, and Retention Activities. Based on local Alameda County WET programming and previous Mental Health Service Act Community Program Planning Process (CPPP) information, Alameda County WET opted to implement the Behavioral Health Loan Repayment Program (BHLRP) for eligible clinical staff and the Behavioral Health Career Pipeline Scholarship and Mentor ship Program for undergraduate stud ents following OSHPD's framework. FY23-24 Anticipated Changes: ACBH WET will conduct a workforce needs assessment survey in FY 23/24 to inform any program implementation changes during FY 23 -24. 2. Training/Technical Assistance Program Description: Provides a coordinated, consistent approach to training and staff development. Develops, researches and provides a broad array of training related to mental health practice; wellness, recovery and resiliency; peer employment and supports and management dev elopment. 1. ACBH Training Unit FY21-22 Outcomes, Impact and Challenges: From the period of July 1, 2021 - June 30 2022, the ACBH T raining Unit (TU) provided or collaborated in a total of 71 training activities; trained a total of 2469 ACBH and contracted provider (CBO) staff. The TU sponsored and provided a total of 302 continuing education (CE) credits to LCSWs, LMFTs, LPCCs, LEPs, Addiction Professionals, and RN's, and 252.5 CE hours for Psychologist. Training topics covered a vari ety of issues including, but not limited to, Mental Health First Aide; Adult and Youth Suicide Assessment & Intervention; Preventing, De -Escalating, and Managing Aggressive Behavior in Behavioral Health Settings; Tobacco Cessation Interventions; Legal and Ethical issues; and WORKFORCE EDUCATION & TRAINING687 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG trainings related to Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services in Health and Health Care (CLAS). Provided trainings related to trauma informed care including \"Surviving Compassion Fatigue a.k.a Secondary and Vicarious Trauma\" ; \"Understanding Nervous System Regulation and Culturally Sensitive Restorative Practices for Providers and Clients in Times of Crisis.\" The training \"Trauma Informed Standards, Practices, and Strategies for Healthcare Organizations: Safety Talk in the Con text of CLAS and Cultural Competency\" was provided by the Office of Ethnic Services and supported by the training institute. Provided five (5) trainings in Adult Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) and two (2) Youth MHFA trainings thereby certifying 75 ACBH an d provider staff. An additional six (6) MHFA trainings were provided to the community including two (2) that were provided to 23 staff of the Fremont, Union City, and Albany City Library branches. Provide continuing education credits for the California S tate University East Bay two -year post graduate Infant and Early Childhood Mental Health certificate program in which 15 students are enrolled. Provided five (5) trainings in Adult Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) and two (2) Youth MHFA trainings thereby certifying 75 ACBH and provider staff. An additional six (6) MHFA trainings were provided to the community including two (2) that were provided to 23 staff of the Fremont, Union City, and Albany City Library branches. Training outcomes are measured using self -administered evaluations. Each training proposes measurable learning objectives to be achieved by the end of the training. Following the training, attendees evaluate whether the objectives are met using a Likert scale from 1 -5 (strongly disagree to strongly agree). They also evaluate the training content, instructor, technology, accessibility, and program administration. At the end of every training, participants are encouraged to complete an evaluation and if they want continuing education credit, it is required. For all trainings, evaluation data results indicate all outcome measures are being met on an average of at least a 4 or 5 of the Likert scale, with 5 being \"strongly agree.\" Challenges: For the Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) trainings, the transition from in person trainings to the online platform presents a challenge and limitation because participants need to complete 2 -hours of pre -work prior to the instructor -led online training. For all scheduled trainings an average of 2 -4 out of 20 registrants did not complete the prework. There are always a number of no shows for in person trainings as people's schedules and circumstances change, but the requirement of prework plus the ability to use an online platform presents additional hurdles for persons who want to get certified in MHFA. There continues to be challenges related to the Learning Management System (LMS), SumTotal, that was purchased in 2019. Although there was a plan to \"go -live\" with the new system in May 2020, because of system glitches and challenges with getting user acco unts for the 4,000+ contracted provider staff, the number of licenses has been reduced to 400 which has limited its use. Currently the LMS's use in the Training Unit is creating accounts for contracted ACBH employees to complete mandatory HIPPA/Privacy courses during their on -boarding. FY22-23 Progress Report : For FY 2022, beginning July 1, 2022: As of November 7, 2022, the Training Unit has thus far provided or collaborated in a total of 16 training activities and trained 496 ACBH and contracted provider staff. The WORKFORCE EDUCATION & TRAINING688 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Training Unit has sponsored and provided 56.5 continuing education (CE) credits to LCSWs, LMFTs, LPCCs, LEPs, Addiction Professionals, and RNs, and 44 CE hours for Psychologists. Training topics were provided on a variety of issues including adult and youth suicide assessment & intervention, mental health first aid, de -escalating and managing aggressive behavior, and trainings related to trauma, responding to crisis, and using a telehealth platform. Continue to maintain provider accre ditation and offer required continuing education (CE) credit for Licensed Clinical Social Workers, Licensed Marriage and Family Therapists, Licensed Professional Clinical Counselors, Licensed Educational Psychologists, Licensed Clinical Psychologists, Registered Nurses. By the end of the 21/22 fiscal year eight mental health first aid trainings will be provided virtually for between 140 and 150 county and contracted provider staff. Five of the trainings are Adult Mental Health First Aid and three are Youth Mental Health First Aid. ACBH WET hired a new Training Officer effective May 16, 2022 following the retirement of the previous Training Officer in January, 2022. FY23-24 Anticipated Changes: As part of organizational structural changes within ACBH, in October the Workforce Education and Training (WET) team transitioned to be under the leadership of the Office of the Behavioral Health Director. The director's vision is to have a more coordinated effort for trainings across the department and to develop a departmental training plan. The training unit is in the process of hiring a program coordinator and an administrative assistant . It is anticipated that due to the growth in its capacity ; TU will be able to step -up, support and coordinate additional systemwide trainings. While training for the foreseeable future continues to be Internet based, the training unit is looking forward to some version of in person training and anticipates the development of hybrid sessions that give the learner a choice between online or in person training experience. The training unit looks forward to expanding training topics and offering curriculum that meet the needs of our systems of care as well as our community -based organiz ations. The use of focus groups as well as surveys will help us better understand community need and create new partnerships that will enhance delivery of educational services throughout the system. The training unit sees the consolidation of SumTotal and Cornerstone as an opportunity to revisit the ways the training unit utilizes the LMS system. We are hoping that issues of data collection as well as the ability to use the system will be addressed in more creative and effective way. We are excited about t he opportunity to provide online learning content including but not limited to courses, videos and other training materials To view the detail ed report of training offerings for FY 2021 -22, see: \"Appendix Trainings \" 2. ACBH Office of the Medical Director - Workforce Development and Training Activities WORKFORCE EDUCATION & TRAINING689 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Alameda County Behavioral Health, Office of the Medical Director (OMD), Workforce Development Programs and Services are aimed at building the skill set of the behavioral health and primary care workforce in Alameda County to deliver high quality culturally responsive care management services to complex and high need behavioral health clients. The following types of \"on -site\" workforce development training s and mentoring opportunities for primary care and behavioral health Safety Net providers illustrates the continuous commitment of ACBH to providing quality care services to its underserved and low-income residents during FY 2021/2022: The continuous fundi ng of a yearlong on -site clinical Fellowship experience for one (1) selected UCSF School of Psychiatry student at the Health Care Services Agency, Healthcare for the Homeless Services, TRUST Primary Care Clinic.

With the Consultant Psychiatrists having access to and understanding of the County's specialty behavioral healthcare system, they continue to be a bridge for care coordination for Alame da County's primary care Safety Net System. The program continues to help improve service capacity in the primary care clinics by helping their medical and behavioral health providers improve skills and comfort level when diagnosing and treating primary ca re patients with complex behavioral health conditions. During the last six months of PYS, the Primary Care Psychiatric Consultation Program (PCPCP) staff were able to provide 2,683 consultations services and 37 training presentations to primary care pro viders and behavioral health clinicians in nine Alameda County Community Health Centers. During 20/21, the Primary Care Psychiatric Consultation staff were able to provide 2,683 consultations services and 37 training presentations to primary care providers and behavioral health clinicians in eight Alameda County Community Health Centers and one HIV Specialty Care Health Center. With the Primary Care Psychiatric Consultants being ACBH staff, they have also helped to improve care coordination by assisting Safety Net primary care providers and behavioral health clinicians learn how to properly complete the required screening documents for the ACBH, ACCESS Office that will facilitate a high need patient's approved admission into the County's Specialty Mental Health or SUD Systems of Care. ACBH has continued to fund 12 Integrated Behavioral Health Care Coordinators (IBHCCs) positions in eight Alameda County FQHCs. During the past fiscal year, the ACBH funded IBHCCs provided 1,775 client care coordinati on referrals to ACBH, Specialty mental health services and 107 client referrals to ACBH, Substance Use Disorders services. Pediatric Care Coordinator Pilot In January, 2021, ACBH approved Alameda Health Consortium's (AHC) request to fund a new pilot Workforce Development Project to support one Pediatric Care Coordinator (PCC) position in eight Alameda County, community health centers. The PCCs are responsibl e for linking pediatric clients to medical, behavioral, and social services, as well as act as the liaison between the client and the community, and serve to dissolve the silos between the health center's medical and BH departments' staff. They are also working to support young clients with the basic health and social needs to minimize their risks for entering WORKFORCE EDUCATION & TRAINING690 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG the criminal justice system as adults. In May, 2022, AHC requested MHSA funding for three additional PCC positions with one being placed in La Clinic a de la Raza, Tiburcio Vasquez Health Center, and Asian Health Center starting July, 2022. The PCCs provided 9,6T8 care coordination services to pediatric patients and their families during FY 21/22: 1. Number of clients referred to wraparound services: 5,052 2. Number of clients given BH, pediatric, or trauma screenings: 3,426 3. Number of clients that screen positively for ACEs, and are given appropriate follow -up resources: 1,200 3. Mental Health Career Pathways Program Description: Develops a mental health career pipeline strategy in community colleges, which serve as an academic entry point for consumers, family members, ethnically and culturally diverse students, and individuals interested in human services education, and can lead to employment in t he ACBH workforce. FY21-22 Outcomes, Impact and Challenges: MHSA WET provided funding to FACES for the Future, Ohlone Community College, Center for Empowering Refugees and Immigrants (CERI ), Beat s Rhyme s and Life and California State University East Bay (CSUEB) to develop Mental Health Career Pathways . ACBH WET has partnered with the contracted organizations and programs and implemented the following programs and/or activities: 1. FACES for the Future Bright Young Minds (BYM) conference introduces students to careers in behavioral health. The FACES for the Future success fully im plement ed the Bright Young Minds virtual conference in partnership with Alameda County Behavioral Health and Eden Area Regional Occupational Programming. Serving students from across Southern Alameda County, the event was held April 19 and April 20, 2022 and includ ed workshops on trauma informed practice, wellness and grief recovery. 150 students from Hayward, San Leandro, San Lorenzo, and Castro Valley participated in the two -day virtual event. Also, 90 seniors were certified in Mental Health First Aid to support a dvancement in their professional and college pathway. The FACES for the Future team supported the teachers and staff at Skyline High School in Oakland by participating in senior capstone project panels and FACES Deputy Director has joined the Advisory Committee for the health pathway. This participation will include providing trainings for students, working with teachers to identify opportunities to learn more about career pathways into behavioral health and so on. FACES will continue their partnership w ith the Skyline community in FY22/23. FACES supported Behavioral Health pipeline program alumni this year by including them in the Youth Advisory Council (YAC). The YAC supports students with direct mentorship, youth leadership opportunities and a stipend for their participation. Interested alumni are recruited during the Fall and are accepted into the program in December, 2021. In FY21 -22 six alumni participated in the YAC and attended many meetings. The students also completed a video highlighting welln ess strategy that was distributed throughout the FACES network. FACES continued its deep partnership with Eden Area Regional Occupational Programming (ROP) and implemented its FACES Public Health Youth Corps project on -site. This work provides students w ith some introductory training and certification in 4 professional skills: Mental Health First Aid, Basic Life Support/CPR, WORKFORCE EDUCATION & TRAINING691 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Narcan (for opioid overdose intervention) and Stop the Bleed (for trauma and injury). This program not only helps students be more c ompetitive as they enter the fields of behavioral health but also provides needed safety net crisis and emergency management skills in high need communities. FACES will continue this work moving into the next fiscal year beginning July 1, 2022. 2. Ohlone Community College Mental Health Programs A. Mental Health Advocacy Program In March 2021, Ohlone Community College in collaboration with ACBH WET hosted an online behavioral health career panel and mentoring event to bring awareness of the wide variety of behavioral health careers to students already serving in their school as mental health n avigators and advocates. The larger goal was to foster and grow students into a career pipeline with interactive experiences in order to attract an emerging, diverse workforce to the behavioral health care field. Ohlone College hosted two cohorts of the Mental Health Advocacy Program which included nineteen students from a wide range of affinity groups, including Student Accessibility Services, Puente Learning Community, Veterans, and undocumented students. Students' service learning projects included events and campaigns such as \"Caring for Burmese Community Mental Health\", mental health promotion for veteran students, and a resiliency -focused campaign. A proposal was submitted to Ohlone College's Curriculum Committee to transition the Mental Health Advocacy Program into a two -series noncredit certificate program titled 'Certificate of Completion in Community Mental Health\" I and II. B. Mental Health Navigator Program The 2021 -22 navigator cohort consisted of eight students representing four community colleges: Berkeley City College, Chabot College, Las Positas College, and Ohlone College; this was the second cohort of the program. Mental health navigators provided a total of 91 case management services to their peers across all four participating campu ses. Among those that received navigator services, 66% were female clients; 76% needed mental health counseling services; 20% needed health insurance coverage support; 11% needed housing resources. A mentorship component was added to the program that in cluded guest speakers who shared their career trajectory during team meetings and at Saturday morning breakfast roundtable convenings. Mental health navigators contributed a special 'Navigator Take podcast series as part of Ohlone's 'Note to Self' po dcast program. They produced a total of six episodes on topics such as \"How to approach family or friends struggling with mental health,\" \"What's with these long wait lists for services?\" and \"Lack of affordable housing.\" Episodes can be found on Spotify and SoundCloud. A peer reviewed manuscript describing the navigator's first year pilot program titled \"Community College Mental Health Navigators: A Pilot Program to Improve Access to Care\" was published in the WORKFORCE EDUCATION & TRAINING692 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG May 2022 issue of Health Promotion Practice journal. The article can be found here: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/15248399221090917 C. Alameda County Behavioral Health Career Pipeline Scholarship and Mentorship Program The Alameda County Behavioral Health Career Pipeline Scholarship and Mentorship Program was launched in Spring 2022 with a team consisting of a program director and two student assistants who conducted outreach to eligible campuses and programs. Outreach efforts included presentations to the Alameda County Mental Health Forum, six drop -in information sessions via Zoom, seven presentations to stakeholder groups, and twelve presentations and tabling events to select clubs and classes. Outr each materials were developed which included a scholarship program webpage, a brief promotion video, an informational PowerPoint slide deck; and various flyers. A total of nineteen scholarship applications were received; eleven students have been awarded financial scholarships to support their undergraduate education and participate in a mentorship program. FY22-23 Progress Report : The StepUp Mental Health Program at Ohlone College explor ed the curriculum approval process with the College Curriculum Committee Chair in response to the WET manager proposing institutionalizing of the Wellness, Recovery and Resiliency curriculum. Ohlone College's Curriculum Committee approved the proposed reque st to transition the Mental Health Advocacy Program into a two -series noncredit certificate program titled 'Certificate of Completion in Community Mental Health\" I and II. The certificate program is based on ACBH's commissioned curriculum on wellness, resil iency, and recovery. The college's Curriculum Committee approved the proposals which means that Ohlone will no longer need funding of Alameda County Behavioral Health; instead, the college will benefit from receiving apportionment dollars from the state f or enrollment. In March 2022, Ohlone Community College in collaboration with ACBH WET hosted an online behavioral health career panel and mentoring event to bring awareness of the wide variety of behavioral health careers to students already serving in t heir school as mental health navigators and advocates. The larger goal was to foster and grow students into a career pipeline with interactive experiences in order to attract an emerging, diverse workforce to the behavioral health care field. FY23-24 Anticipated Changes: ACBH WET is anticipating expansion of the Mental Health Navigator Program in FY23/24. 3. CERI: Center for Empowering Refugees and Immigrants ACBH WET funded Wellness in Action (WiA), a workforce development program, at the Center fo r Empowering Refugees and Immigrants (CERI). WiA develops career pathways in the mental health field and improve mental health access for underserved refugees and immigrants. WiA works with community https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/15248399221090917WORKFORCE EDUCATION & TRAINING693 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG leaders from indigenous, refugee, and immigrant communit ies interested in promoting mental health and wellness. WiA offered eleven mini -grant awards to support grassroots community leaders and provide d technical and clinical consultation and skill building trainings for careers in community mental health. To view the Wellness in Action mid-term report, see: Appendix 2_MHSA WET_FY 2021 -22_CERI MiniGrant Midterm Report 4. Beat s Rhymes and Life Beats Rhymes and Life (BRL) is a newly funded MHSA WET Program to increase educational pathways and training for Transition Age Youth (TAY) to enter the human services professions such as social work, psychology, nursing, education, and our Hip -Hop Therapy model. BRL supports TAY in their educational and vocational d evelopment. Participants learn skills in how to work with youth as peer monitors and artistic instructors. The 1st 12 weeks of instruction focus on facilitation skills, group work and artistry skills while the second half gives participants the opportunity to engage BRL's community of care through direct practice (mental health awareness presentations, one -time workshops, etc.). Target Population : Alameda youth 17 -24, who have graduated from High School, earned a GED or are interested in earning their GE D. BRL prioritizes African American or those of diverse African ancestry but serve anyone who met the other above -mentioned general stipulations. FY21 -22 Outcomes, Impacts, and Challenges Staffing: BRL filled the workforce education specialist position which was the final missing piece of the program staff Client Enrollment: BRL met the program goal of engaging 20 TAY youth, during the 21/22 fiscal year. BRL used a rolling admission model: Six pa rticipants, or Fellows, launched and have completed the 12 weeks of classes and readying for direct practice and there is a second cohort of six in the pipeline completing intake and assessment and about to start their cycle of classes. BRL recruited enro lled and engaged the final 8 before the end of the fiscal year. Training : The program provided 36 hours of training on work readiness, social skills, trust, safety, emotional regulation, self -efficacy, self -regard, accountability, facilitation, group, peer mentorship and the use of artistry for rapport building and healing. Cohort members received direct practice, as well as shadowing opportunities, case management and or therapeutic supports as requested. Field Exposure: All Fellows shadow or make site v isits with professionals in the social services field. Each Fellow received up to six shadowing or guest lecture opportunities overall over the course of their year in the program. Guest lecturers/mentors were a mix of social service practitioners: ER cli nicians, organizational psychologists, therapists, high school counselors, and consultants. This gave participants access and opportunity to hear how mentors figured out their purpose and the path challenges and benefits from their chosen profession. Case Management: All academy fellows received a MAPS assessment, BRL's own internal assessment tool. This assessment covers mental health, academic, physical, and other areas where urgent needs can be highlighted, and goals set for case managers. Fellows received an average of six sessions each of case management and/or individual therapy support. Categories of support have included grant applications, WORKFORCE EDUCATION & TRAINING694 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG stability supports, mental/emotional care, college applications, job readiness, career exploration and g oal setting . Challenges BRL leadership and staff are still processing the pandemic. Staff were in telehealth services exclusively for two years and are striving to give participants what they want and need which is in person engagement while maintain fair standards that promote safety for all. This program was funded as of July 1, 2021, therefore BRL needed to launch the program while still working on startup objectives such as recruitment of staff and curriculum development . As a result, the program had to push back intended August start to September. The current staff have worked above and beyond to fill all the vacant roles and responsibilities. BRL anticipates the program in the spring to run more at capacity due to fu ller staffing and having more of the programming already in place. Recruitment, and more specific ally, finding precise recruitment partners for long term collaboration toward building sustainable pipelines for TAY, is an ongoing process. Some of the most interesting things that came up were participants' need for stability and mental/emotional supports while very much needing to activate as gainfully employed adults. Whereas the program is built for youth who actively seek to be in human services, for some of the participants, this is the first time they are being introduced to human services as a field. They are often getting started on their learning journey of profe ssional fields and professionalism simultaneously. The program is also seeing that more high schools offer experiential/internship models earlier. Beats, Rhymes, and Life's program is designed developmentally for young adults, but the captive audience seems to present earlier in these alternative model High Schools. BRL is continuing to look at ways to build into these schools through corresponding Hip Hop Therapy prevention programs and build the pipelines from three to five high schools and colleges. FY22 -23 Progress Report Continuing with the rolling format for recruitment we have engaged five new members for the fall. This was fed from BRL Summer Junior Academy which is part of a new strategy to introduce youth to both Prevention and Pathway progr ams. BRL have expanded High School outreach partner scope to include Rudsdale, Skyline, and Latitude high schools (This is in addition to BRL's regular HS partners: Oakland High, Met West, Oakland School of the Arts, & Castlemont). Rudsdale High School reached out after the violent disruption they experienced and BRL is planning supportive mental health presentations as well as workshops to support their population to process and support restoring a sense of stability. BRL's goal is to create a sustain able pipeline into the wet program using the OUSD pathway system. Specifically, Arts Media and Entertainment, Education Child Development & Family, and Health Science & Medical Technology https://www.ousd.o rg/domain/5451 https://www.ousd.org/domain/5451WORKFORCE EDUCATION & TRAINING695 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG BRL filled the workforce education specialist this past summer. This was a key position that was missing from the first fiscal year. FY 2 3-24 Anticipated Changes BRL has made the following adjustments to its program recruitment strategy: 1. Focused more on high school recruitment changed contract to so that 17 -year -old high school seniors can participate if school schedule aligns. 2. Offer stipend rewards for successful referrals 3. Create more video content to better tell and share our story. BRL has decided to rename the case management position title to wellness coach. We have experienced adverse reaction and negative association with the case management title. Especially by system involved youth. 5. CSUEB - Early Child hood Mental Health Postgraduate Certificate Program FY 2 1-22 Outcomes , Impacts , and Challenges MHSA WET provided funding in FY18/19 to launch a two -year pilot Early Childhood Mental Health Post Graduate Continuing Education Certificate Program at Cal State University, East Bay. The overarching goal is to build capacity in a culturally diverse early childhood mental health workforce to meet the social, emotional and developmental needs of young children, ages birth to five, and families in Alamed a County. In FY 2018/19 Alameda County Behavioral Health (ACBH) and California State University East Bay (CSUEB) launched the pilot Early Childhood Mental Health Post Graduate Continuing Education Certificate Program which focused on the developmental foundations of infant and early childhood mental health. The program began with a cohort of fifteen (15) students, fourteen (14) of whom were subsidized by Mental Health Services Act Workforce, Education & Training (MHSA WET ) funds and one (1) paid out of pocket. Of the fifteen (15) students, eleven (11) were clinicians of color, ten (10) spoke one of the identified threshold languages, and all fifteen (15) worked in Alameda County early childhood community -based organizations (CBOs). In year two (FY 19/20), Cohort 1 saw the fifteen (15) members of the original cohort return intending to complete the second year of the program. However, one (1) student dropped in Fall 2019 and fourteen (14) of the fifteen (15) students comple ted the program in December 2020. In year three (FY 20/21), a new second cohort of 16 students was recruited (22 applicants and 16 accepted into the program). The recruitment process started in Spring of 2020. In the spirit of collaboration, meetings were conducted with CYASOC Leadership Team and the CSUEB Cohort Instructor to review the recruitment and selection criteria, the steps and resources needed and the timeline. A rubric was developed to assess students that meet criteria. The planning team also discussed lessons learned from WORKFORCE EDUCATION & TRAINING696 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG the last cohort cycle to apply best and improving practices for the new cohort. In year four (FY2021 -2022) , ACBH and CSUEB hosted a competitive application process (in Fall 2020) and recruited 15 students (from 19 appli cants) for Cohort 2. Recruitment announcements elicited individuals who focus on early childhood skill development as well as exhibit cultural competencies that can meet the unique needs of the diverse Alameda County child and family populations. Recruitme nt outreach extended to the Alameda County network of service provider agencies, to networks of CSUEB staff, and to employees an interns at current clinic and outpatient service sites. The range of interest from CBO employees increased; and as such, there is a wider range of organizations represented in the second cohort. Program Evaluation The program was evaluated by a unique survey developed by UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland in the first year of the pilot. In the second year of the cohort, the corresponding evaluation survey was administered by UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital, Oakland evaluator, Dr. Laura Frame, and in years three and four it was administered by ACBH staff. The evaluation focused on methodological approaches used for stude nt training. To this end, the evaluation provides ongoing feedback for managers to ensure continuous quality improvement. Evaluation methods used to assess the program include: a training evaluation (online student satisfaction survey); the Learning Curve Survey in year one (to assess student measurement of knowledge, skills, and integration/application of core concepts), and reflective writing assessments. To view the full report and evaluation of the pilot of this program see: Appendix 3_MHSA WET_FY 2021 - Cohort_Final Report FY 2 3-24 Anticipated Changes This program will be concluded at the end of December 2022, with the graduation of the second cohort of post -graduate students . ACBH and CSUEB have had discussions regarding sustainability of the program beyond this pilot ending in December 2022. 6. Internship Coordination and Residency Programs Program Description : Coordinates academic internship programs across the ACBH workforce. Outreaches to educational institutions to publicize internship opportunities. 1. UCSF Public Psychiatr y Fellowship Program FY21-22 Outcomes, Impact and Challenges (UCSF): ACBH WET and the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), School of Medicine partners to provide behavioral health education and clinical training to Fellows from UCSF Public Psychiatry Fellowship (PPF) Program. WORKFORCE EDUCATION & TRAINING697 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG In FY 2 1-22, UCSF recruit ed one psy chiatry fellow to place in the BHCS clinical education and training program at the Trust Clinic. The selected UCSF School of Psychiatry fellow successfully participat ed and completed the fellowship in the yearlong on -site clinical fellowship experience at the Health Care Services Agency, Healthcare for the Homeless Services, Trust Primary Care Clinic. FY22-23 Progress Report (UCSF) : In FY 2022 -23, ACBH did not host a fellow as UCSF was unable to recruit a participant for the Program. FY23-24 Anticipated Changes (UCSF) : UCSF School of Psychiatry is currently in the process of recruiting a psychiatry fellow and we're anticipating hosting one p articipant in FY23 -24. 2. ACBH Graduate Clinical Internship Program FY21 -22 Outcomes, Impact and Challenges (Graduate Internship) : Manage and facilitate the onboarding process for Children Young Adult System of Care (CYASOC), Adult and Older Adult System of Care (AOASOC), Adult Forensic Behavioral Health and Vocational Rehabilitation, Nursing, and other programs/units within the ACBH department. The mission and goal of the internship program is to provide training that optimizes student learning, leadership, and overall support and development. Ongoing relationship building efforts between the internsh ip coordinator, HR, Finance, clinical coordinator, and clinical intern supervisors positively impacts efficiency and value to the Internship Program. The competing priorities of multiple internal and external stakeholders requires a higher level of coordin ation and standardization. Due to the COVID 19 pandemic there was a need to pivot all internship program operations to electronic and virtual platforms. The shift to a mostly virtual internship program was swift and necessary. We are entering the 3rd year of the pandemic and the internship program functions continue to be mostly virtual and electronic. We will be moving towards making most of the processes electronic and paperless. Transition of previous internship clinical coordinator and introductory training for new incoming internship clinical coordinator and training officer positions . Provided updates and revision of documents to the \"Onboarding Resource Manual\" which was created to provide guidance, structure, and compliance for the internship pr ogram. Developed necessary forms and/or documents as needed to address new program policies, procedures and applicable laws, regulations, and ethical standards of practice. Effectively managed and facilitated the amendments to two (2) practicum agreements for schools in collaboration with county counsel. WORKFORCE EDUCATION & TRAINING698 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG FY 21 -22 Impacts (Graduate Internship Program ): Eighteen (18) students were onboarded and placed within ACBH programs and units. The number of interns was slightly lower than the previous year, more than likely due to the pandemic. Five (5) interns with the Children's and Young Adults System of Care, Nine (9) with Adult & Older Adult System of Care, Eight (8) of those Nursing students, Three (3) with CONREP, One (1) Other. 2021 -22 ACBH Intern Statistics - Ethnicity (Number of interns= 18) African American 4 - 22% Asian 2 - 11% Caucasian 5 - 28% Hispanic/Latino 5 - 28% No response 2 - 11% 2021 -22 ACBH Intern Data - Language (Number of interns= 18) English 10 - 56% Cantonese 0 Mandarin 0 Spanish 5 - 28% Tagalog 0 Vietnamese 0 Other 2 - 11% No response 1 - 5% One (1) intern declined internship assignment , and Four (4) interns were exposed to a total of eighteen (18) virtual trainings, including: A Better Way - Telehealth, Early Childhood Assessment; Expressive Arts, Documentation Training; HANDLE (Holistic Approach to Neuro Development and Learning Efficiency); Strengthening Relationships Through Partnerships; Pediatric Psychopharmacology and Suicide Assessment and Intervention, CBT, DBT, etc. All in -service trainings were virtual through ZOOM. In-service training evaluations indicates a positive impact . In-service trainings and trainers were extremely beneficial and well received by the interns again this year Annual internship fairs and internship orientations - Coordination, Facilitation, Representation : Represented ACBH at local internship fairs for bay area colleges and universities virtually which provided potential student interns a first impression of ACBH in a welcoming, low -pressure, and informative settings. These are marketing impact activities, publicizing various learning opportunities and offering information and materials about ACBH's systems of care. All internship fairs were conducted virtuall y. WORKFORCE EDUCATION & TRAINING699 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG ACBH Internship Program Representative for (2) virtual internship fairs (approximately 20 students) from Cal State East Bay and SJSU. The ACBH Intern Orientation is a full two (2) day collaborative effort with clinical supervisors and clinical director to provide a positive and successful start to the internship assignment. Students are provided with presentations, tours, and group interaction. ACBH Intern Orientation was conducted virtually. FY 21 -22 Challenges Creating bandwidth across the systems of care impacted teams pose challenges as individual staff will take on new functions to manage tasks, responsibilities, and people within their programs to keep the new process functioning with integrity. While diversity is promoted as an essential priority, there continues to be a challenging lack of African Americans and Latinos, particularly African American male intern applicants. Increased cultural competence training for interns and intern supervisors is a need that has been a challenge to fulfil with existing internal training capacity. Additional funding (coordination and collaboration with WET Institute and Ethnic Services Department) by ACBH would allow content expertise (outside of Alameda County staff) to train on cultural competence and other subject matter. Recruiting and retaining in -service trainers for both Fall & Spring schedules . Recruitment challenges include identifying potential interns who speak ACBH's threshold languages and who refle ct Alameda County's cultural diversity and committing adequate staff to cover two -day orientation events . FY22 -23 Progress Report Developing improved system to collect and manage training and program evaluation results to inform program planning, intern recruitment, placement and follow up. Continuing to collect and manage training and program evaluation results to inform program planning, intern recruitment, placement and follow up Facilitation of the post -internship program evaluation forms for data preservation. This effort seeks to gather information from the intern perspective for continuous enhancement of internship program. Improvement of onboarding efforts, in conjunction with system leaders, to create standard guidelines, practice, and pro tocol for onboarding interns for all systems of care. FY23 -24 Anticipated Changes In the process of creating a more formal and inclusive intern recruitment strategy under the guidance of the ACBH Director's office. Developing internship program formal procedures and policies to further enhance program services . Social media presence is imperative for the internship program to better communicate and promote program. WORKFORCE EDUCATION & TRAINING700 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Developing an online protocol for the Internship Program and onboarding process. Update and enhance internship website to reflect most current internship positions available to support students in their program search. 2. Korean Community Center of the East Bay - Mental Health Asian Workforce Pipeline Program FY 21 -22 Outcomes , Impact s, and Challenges KCCEB trained 6 MSW/MA/MFT students for M ental Health A sian Pipeline 's (MHAP) second cohort (4 first-year and 2 second -year; 1 male, 5 female). Interns came from CSU East Bay, Dominican University, and Palo Alto University. This year's intern cohort spoke Korean, Japanese, Cantonese and Mandarin in addition to English. Services were offered in Korean, Cantonese, Mandarin and English. Four interns focused on school -based services at Alameda Science and Technology and San Leandro High Scho ol, API community children, families, and adults and two interns supported Korean and Chinese seniors. KCCEB operated a hybrid -model so that some interns saw clients in -person and others remained online or used the phone. In -person clients were seen at hom e, at KCCEB's center and also at senior housing sites and schools. KCCEB's graduate interns were all \"returning adult\" students. Three were first -generation college students and three were first -generation people living in the U.S. Another student was whi te-American , working in an Asian -serving organization for the first -time. For three -fourths of the students, KCCEB was their first experience in a primarily Asian -serving organization. Many were passionate about wanting to serve the API community and have a strong desire to use their bilingual and bicultural skills and cultural lived experience to fill the gap of services in their community. Many shares that they heard of KCCEB through word of mo uth from their fellow classmates who were former KCCEB interns who had such positive experience in interning at KCCEB and the culturally responsive rich experience and support received through their internship. Some of these students mentioned that their o wn backgrounds and struggles ( i.e., first-generation immigrants, struggles with lack of resources and challenges in navigating the US system, challenges with acculturation and family intergenerational conflicts and traumas) motivated them to serve their c ommunity. It is noteworthy to mention that the former and current interns are pursuing their clinical path in community mental health, joining non -profit organizations that focus on serving marginalized communities. One MSW intern will be continuing her second -year internship at Asian Health Services Specialty Mental Health to provide treatment services to clients with moderate to severe mental health symptoms. Two interns will continue their second -year internship at KCCEB to expand on their clinical ski lls serving monolingual speaking Chinese and Korean community members. Another MSW intern deferred her second year due to maternity leave, but plans to return to complete her internship at KCCEB Spring of 2023. Lastly, our MA intern is graduating Fall of 2 022 and plans to pursue community mental health work in the near future. This year, another intern has moved into KCCEB as a staff role providing clinical case management and counseling services to monolingual Korean speaking immigrants and other API youth , adults, and family. KCCEB is exploring applying for Medi -Cal contracts in order to be able to support moderate -to-severe clients in language and also have a place for interns to continue serving this population. WORKFORCE EDUCATION & TRAINING701 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG KCCEB's internship program is becoming more well- known through the Bay Area in supporting bilingual/bicultural clinicians. This year, we had to turn away 6 -7 interns who applied. We are also growing our partnerships with other schools and this year will be pursuing a relationship with Golden G ate University in addition to our current partner list of 6 schools across California. KCCEB has been recruited to be part of a five -year grant opportunity with University of Southern California (USC) to develop a Center of Excellence, advancing behaviora l healthcare for Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander communities while reducing behavioral health -related disparities . FY 21 -22 Impac t Interns provided mental health outreach and engagement (1000+ Korean, Chinese, and other API), senior wellness checks (100 Korean seniors and 50 Chinese seniors), wellness support groups and psycho -educational workshops, and had one -on-one case management and PEI clients (total of 60 clients). First -year students held a case load of 8 -12 clients and seco nd-year students held caseloads of 10-15 clients. Finally, our interns had a unique opportunity to be actively involved in advocacy efforts including the Behavioral Health Equity Coalition, Senior Prevention Injury Partnership, East Bay Immigrant and Refugee Forum, API Coalition Contra Costa County, State Oral Health Alliance, Health Justice Network, and California Pan -Ethnic Health Network. Interns' support was especially critical due to the pandemic and anti -Asian violence. Interns work ensured that th e Korean Community seniors' needs were being met and that they did not fall through service cracks. Interns provided a safe and trusting space for community members to talk to and share their experiences and challenges, especially those who were exposed to Anti-Asian sentiments, experienced vicarious trauma from Anti -Asian violence, pandemic collective trauma, and increased mental health symptoms. Interns played an essential role in Senior Wellness Checks to isolated Korean and Chinese elders including offe ring concrete and tangible resources to address their immediate crises and creating a safety net for isolated limited English proficient community members. Interns were also actively involved in advocating for essential bilingual and bicultural mental health services and mental health professionals to support the increased mental health needs of the Asian and Pacific Islanders community. Compared to last year, KCCEB is seeing an increase in referrals: 52 referrals compared to 30 from last year. With t he support of interns, KCCEB provided counseling services to 47 clients . This is the first year KCCEB have received self -referrals for mental health counseling and had a total of 15 Korean self -referrals, compared to last year's number of 2 referrals. T hey included elders, children, youth and couples. In the past, community referrals have been through proxy or indirect methods (i.e. friends or family calling on behalf of other individuals) due to stigma. We believe community members self -referring is a significant indicator that there is a dire need in the community. We also believe our mental health services are increasing in visibility so that people know they can come seek mental health support in Korean -language at KCCEB. WORKFORCE EDUCATION & TRAINING702 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG FY 21 -22 Challenges There has been an i ncrease in mental health service needs both from youth and from the Korean community . Due to t he COVID -19 pandemic , peoples' mental health has been impacted and KCCEB is seeing more complex cases . KCCEB has received requests for mental health services outside of Alameda County and even outside of California, needing Korean bilingual and bicultural services. FY 23 -24 Anticipated changes (KCCEB): With feedback from the interns, KCCEB is changing the training model in the following ways: 1. KCCEB will be providing a more comprehensive clinical onboarding and training which is changing from 9 days to 21 -day intensive training. 2. Increasing group supervision from bi -weekly to weekly to create a more robust clinical training and support 3. Incorporating more holistic and traditional healing practices in our clinical training curriculum 4. Expanding collaborative partnership with other graduate educational institutes 3. Consumer and Family Member Training, Education and Employment - BestNow FY21-22 Outcomes, Impact and Challenges BestNow is funded by MHSA W orkforce Education and Training (W ET) to provide training, education and employment services to Peers. BestNow focused on recruitment and preparation for the Peer Support Specialist class and successfully recruited 52 Peer Support Specialist Training participants. Provided employment support to a total of 15 graduates, who are contemplating employment for the first time or who are re -entering the job market. Employment support focused on inte rviewing skills, cover letter/resume building, financial literacy, overcoming stress, benefits of returning to work, and emotional skillfulness. Focused heavily on outreach to consumers and collaborated with ACBH and other agencies within the mental healt h and substance use disorder systems of care, to support student access to Peer Support specialist training. Conducted three orientation sessions for each training cycle. Total 35 individuals showed up to get their questions answered by BestNow. Changed trainee selection process allowing larger class size. Restructured training program, including editing curriculum materials to meet CalMHSA required core competencies. BestNow took this opportunity to update materials and strengthen training curriculum a nd training slides. WORKFORCE EDUCATION & TRAINING703 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG BestNow transitioned the peer support training program to utilize Canvas as the program learning platform and assisted all students in registering for Canvas and showed them how to use it. We do all our grading in Canvas, and it has be come a useful component in strengthening our participants digital literacy. FY 21 -22 Challenges Several orientation sessions had a much lower number of participants show up than the number of people who registered using the Zoom link provided on the p rogram outreach materials. This could be due to technology -related challenges from participants or individuals registering too far in advance. BestNow attempted to have a first fully Spanish speaking training cycle but were not able to get enough applicants. We also quickly realized that if we had hosted the course, we would not have been able to assist the graduates with employment related services due to lack of opportunities. BestNow made the decision to shorten the length of each training sessi on because of trainee and facilitator limits on how long they could stay engaged in each Zoom session. Saturday training sessions were removed due to continued feedback from participants. Current training is now offered Monday through Thursday from 5:00p m to 8:30pm. With the BestNow team switching to Canvas we realized we needed to let individuals at orientation know how important it is to have a reliable device to complete assignments, and for those who did not have a device, for us to coordinate how t o lend them one at the BestNow office. In general, some participants struggled with skills such as sending email attachments, navigating the Zoom platform, and even saving and downloading documents. BestNow attempted to address these challenges in variou s ways including adding a \"How to Use Zoom,\" section into our orientation in order to support the participation of people who were new to using Zoom. We have also done a lot of one -on-one support talking with participants through commonly used skills such as saving documents to their devices and attaching documents (such as assignments) to emails. Additionally, because of the continued challenges posed by the COVID -19 pandemic many agencies which previously hosted BestNow interns declined to do so. This mad e it very challenging to find appropriate internship opportunities for our trainees. We were able to place 4 individuals into an internship after graduating. However, this number was low compared to other fiscal years. We realized that another key factor t hat contributed to less internships was due to the change in our training cycles. With our training being 80 -hours long and with SB 803 going into full affect, we have had many students enroll in our training who are already working in the behavioral healt h field and do not need an internship. Furthermore, a continued challenge for our trainees is related to criminal justice records. We continue to have highly qualified trainees rejected from internships/employment opportunities because they have convictio ns on their record, without regard to the time that has passed since their convictions or the nature of their convictions. We maintain that Peer Support Specialists who have personal lived experience with incarceration and the criminal legal system have v aluable insights to share from their experiences and should be given equal opportunities for internships/employment opportunities as those trainees without these experiences. WORKFORCE EDUCATION & TRAINING704 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG FY22 -23 Progress Report In the Fiscal year of 2022 -2023, there have been many great changes. The BestNow team is fully staffed with 4 program trainers and 1 program manager. Due to this it has allowed us to really revamp all of our training slides and make them more interactive. It has also allowed us to make corrections in our curriculum, and restructure assignments/readings in Canvas. We began the fiscal year off by hosting our first training cycle in June. For our June cycle there was a large focus on outreach which was a succ ess. We had our largest class up until that point and successfully graduated 35 individuals. Since our June training cycle, we have hosted an additional 2 trainings. Both of our trainings have had over 30 students in attendance. Additionally, BestNow ran cycles with a very diverse demographic group. So far in FY2022 -2023, we have had 35.3% of our participants identified as African American, 20.2% as European American, 22.2% as Latino, 10.3% as Asian American, 5.1% as middle eastern, 5.1% as Native American , and 2% identified as Pacific Islander. We also successfully hosted two BestNow graduations. Allowing for graduates to celebrate their accomplishment with friends and family. Our most recent graduation had close to 90 people in attendance. As a team we began to see peers struggle with getting the 6 -hour law & ethics continuing education requirement. Due to this we created a 6 -hour law & ethics training to support our peers to meet this requirement. Since July of this year, we have host 5 Law & ethics t rainings. These trainings have consistently had over 70 peers in attendance each time. Additionally, we seen peers struggling with the initial scholarship and grandparenting scholarship applications. Due to this we decided to host scholarship webinars sho wing our peers step by step how to apply and helped them with the application in real time. Since June we have hosted 3 scholarship webinars and have had 25 -30 peers in attendance each time. We did have to limit the number of peers that could be in our sch olarship webinar to no more than 30 at a time. This was due to the difficulty of the application process and because some individuals needed additional tech support. BestNow is expecting to go into 2023 with hosting study guide sessions to help peers prepa re for the state exam. As well as continuing to do our 6 -hour law & ethics trainings. We also plan on adding additional training's that we can offer to peers; however, we have not fully decided as a team what those additional trainings will be. FY23 -24 Anticipated changes BestNow is anticipating many changes for the 2023 -2024 fiscal year such as restructuring the trainings to make them more interactive. This consists of adding more videos into our presentations as well as more role plays. BestNow is considering having 3 different training courses. Two of those will be 80 -hour training specifically for individuals already working in behavioral health care services. This type of training could also be used as refresher training for BestNow alumni who mi ght have graduated many years ago. The third type of training we would offer would be between 120 -180 hours (TBD) and it would be for Peers who want to work in behavioral health care services. This training would be more in -depth and would consist of prese nters coming to teach certain portions of the curriculum as well as teaching the participants about community building and networking. WORKFORCE EDUCATION & TRAINING705 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Moving forward BestNow will make the Peer support training orientation mandatory to all students in order to be accepted into the BestNow course. BestNow anticipate s to add additional trainings for peers to aid in their continuing education. 7. Financial Incentive s Program Description: Offer financial incentives as workforce recruitment and retention strategies, and to increase workforce diversity. Financial Incentives are offered to eligible clinical staff employed in ACBH and to graduate interns placed in ACBH and contracted community -based organizations, and who are linguistically and or culturally able to serve the underserved and unserved populations of the County. The Behavioral Health Loan Repayment Program is for eligible clinical staff who complete a service obligation in public behavioral health in Alameda County. 1.

The ability to recruit and retain a GISP application reviewer team of at least 7-9 members which is comprised of internal staff and CBO members. FY22 -23 Progress Report Launched the 11th cycle of Graduate Intern Stipend Program in September 2022 with a focus on interns across systems, including behavioral health interns in primary care settings. The goal is to increase the number of interns who speak one or more threshold languages such a s: Spanish, Cantonese, Mandarin, Vietnamese, and Tagalog. FY23 -24 Anticipated Changes Use of more modern technology and social media presence to effectively communicate to wider student audience. Make necessary updates and changes to the GISP app lication as needed 2. Alameda County Behavioral Health Career Pipeline Scholarship and Mentorship Program FY21-22 Outcomes, Impact and Challenges Over the past 10 years, the ACBH Workforce Development, Education, and Training (WET) has been collaborating with educational institutions to address behavioral healthcare workforce gaps and build up infrastructure for students to be able to study and fin d career paths into public behavioral/mental health; i.e. a workforce pipeline. One such partnership is with Ohlone College, which has championed the development of strong student engagement and workforce pipeline development programs. In partnership wi th Ohlone Community College, the Alameda County Behavioral Health Career Pipeline Scholarship and Mentorship Program was launched in Spring 2022. A total of nineteen scholarship applications were received; eleven students have been awarded financial scho larships to support their undergraduate education and participate in a mentorship program. WET in collaboration with Ohlone Community College hosted a scholarship awards ceremony and reception on August 11, 2022, to celebrate eleven community college stud ents who were awarded a scholarship from the Alameda County Behavioral Health Career Pipeline Scholarship and Mentorship Program. The program is funded by the State Workforce Education and Training Program, overseen by the Department of Health Care Access and Information (HCAI), with California Mental Health Service Authority (CalMHSA) serving as the fiscal and administrative intermediary. Among the 11 recipients, seven were recent Ohlone College students/graduates. The unique aspect of the program is tha t in addition to tuition support, awardees are participating in a mentorship program where they are WORKFORCE EDUCATION & TRAINING707 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG connected to professionals in the field, building a supportive community with each other, and gaining practical skills to improve their academic success and job prospects. FY21 -22 Progress Report The second Scholarship and Mentorship Program application cycle will begin in January, 2023. Ohlone College started its outreach efforts promoting the upcoming program application opportunity. FY23-24 Anticipated Changes Alameda County WET is not anticipating any significant program changes at this time . The program will continue with funding from the State Department of Health Care Access and Information (HCAI) . 3. Behavioral Health Loan Repayment Program (BHLRP) FY21-22 Outcomes, Impact and Challenges In FY21/22, Alameda County local Loan Repayment Program (ACLRP) was transitioned into the State - funded Regional Workforce Education and Training (WET) Partnership Program (RP). The loan repayment program opportunity started as a local program (Alameda County Loan Repayment Program - ACLRP) and was then transferred to the Workforce Education and Training Program, overseen by the Department of Healthcare Access and Information (HCA I). Each ACLRP applicant who initially applied through CalMHSA's Bonfire portal was asked to re -apply and they were evaluated through the HCAI application portal. In FY21/22, Alameda County WET implemented the Behavioral Health Loan Repayment Program (BH LRP) funded by the State Department of Health Care Access and Information (HCAI). ACBH and CalMHSA executed the Regional Partnership (RP) Loan Repayment and the Behavioral Health Career Pipeline Scholarship and Mentorship Program Participation Agreement (PA) funded by the State Department of Health Care Access and Information (HCAI) on May 26, 2022. Bot h parties executed a first amendment of the ACBH RP Participation Agreement (PA) on September 27, 2022 morphing it into a PA that works for the WET regional partnership (RP) activities. Alameda County work ed with CalMHSA on transitioning the ACLRP cycle 2 applicants into the WET RP round one Behavioral Health Loan Repayment Program (BHLRP) in order to bring the ACLRP in alignment with the WET RP funding and program timeline and other program related requirements. Alameda County launched the State funded Behavioral Health Loan Repayment Program (BHLRP) round two application cycle from October 1 through December 15, 2022. In an effort to increase the volume of applications received, the RP Leads extended the application cycle from November 30, 2022 through December 15, 2022. Alameda County completed the first round of the loan repayment program funded by the State Department of Health Care Access and Information (HCAI) . 25 individuals who represent the diverse communities of Alameda County applied and 17 clinicians from County and contract Community Based Organization (CBO) settings received up to $10,000 towards their outstanding student loans. WORKFORCE EDUCATION & TRAINING708 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Challenges The loan repayment program opportunity started as a local program called the Alameda County Loan Repayment Program (ACLRP) and was then transferred to the Workforce Education and Training Program, overseen by the Department of Healthcare Access and Information (HCAI). Each ACLRP applicant who initially applied through Ca lMHSA's Bonfire portal was asked to re -apply and given the opportunity to get evaluated through the HCAI application portal. This process created a delay of several month before award determinations could be made. Alameda County Behavioral Health needed to shorten the required service obligation to 3 months instead of 12 months for the round one BHLRP awardees . This one -time decision was made uniquely for this set of awardees due to the length of time it took to make award determinations as well as to al ign with the HCAI second round application cycle timeline. The shortened service obligation for the round one award recipients allowed the eligible awardees to apply again for the second round of the Alameda County Loan Repayment Program when the new cycle open ed in October 2022. FY22-23 Progress Report The round two of the State Department of Health Care Access and Information (HCAI) funded Alameda County Behavioral Health Loan Repayment Program application cycle opened from October 1, 2022 through December 15, 2022. FY23-24 Anticipated Changes (BHLRP) : ACBH WET is not anticipating any significant program implementation changes in FY23/24. CAPITAL FACILITIES & TECHNOLOGICAL NEEDSTOP HEADER710 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Capital Facilities & Technolog ical Needs | \"BRINGING PEOPLE AND RESOURCES TOGETHER\" The Capital Facilities & Technological Needs (CFTN ) component of the MHSA \" works towards the creation of a facility that is used for the delivery of MHSA services to mental health clients and their families or for administrative offices. Funds may also be used to support an increase in peer -support and consumer -run facilities, development of community -based settings, and the development of a technological infrastructure for the mental health system to facilitate the highest quality and cost - effective services and supports for clients and their families \". It should be noted that CFTN funding was originally a 10-year block grant, which ended on June 30, 2017. However, ACBH continues to transfer CSS funds to the CFTN component for various programs and projects . Pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code Section 5892(b), Counties may use a portion of their CSS funds for WET, CFTN, and the Local Prudent Reserve. The total amount of CSS funding used for this purpose shall not exceed 20% of the total average amount of funds allocated to that County for the previous five years. ACBH's MHSA funded Capital Facilitie s projects are in alignment with Alameda County's Vision 2026. More on this vision can be seen at https://vision2026.acgov.org/index.page New Projects Approved for Funding, Implementation FY 23/24 Medical Respite Expansion Projects (CF2) ACBH in collaboration with the Office of Homeless Care and Coordination, a division within the county's parent agency Health Care Services Agency, continue to develop new medical respite opportunities. The remainin g funds within this workplan's original three -million -dollar allocation will be directed toward the ongoing renovation work for the Alameda Point Collaborative ( workplan # CF4) and a new project called the St. Regis.

PROJECT NAME: CF5: African American Wellness Hub Complex Project Description: The African American Wellness Hub Complex will be a beacon of hope and energy for the African American community in Alameda County. The development of the complex began in FY 20/21 and is ongoing. ACBH has budgeted a total of $14.8M in one-time funding ($10.7M in MHSA and $4.1M in non -MHSA) to purchase land and/or renovate an existing space. ACBH staff are working closely with community consultants and the Alameda County General Services Agency Department on this step of the process. Once this phase is complete additional planning will take place regarding services and supports for the Hub Complex. FY 22/23 Progress: ACBH, in partnership with the Alameda County General Services Agency (GSA) department, continues to work on the development of the African American Wellness Hub Complex (HUB) by exploring and examining the inventory of County owned facilities for the HUB and oth er potential suitable sites. In addition to the ongoing exploration of space and facilities, ACBH has created a video to chronicle the years long effort to build a wellness center that focuses on the mental and behavioral health needs of the African Ameri can community. Once the video is released the link will be included in this document and on the MHSA website . In preparation for the Wellness Hub, the Office of Health Equity will conduct multiple listening sessions in spring 2023 to better understand what types of services the community would like to see in the Hub once it's ready for operations. Results from these listening sessions will be available later in the calendar year of 2023. www.ACMHSA.org MHSA websiteCAPITAL FACILITIES & TECHNOLOGICAL NEEDS714 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG More information will be available on the progress of either a land purchase or building purchase/renovation as it becomes available and will be posted on the MHSA website and in the next MHSA Plan Update FY 24/25 . PROJECT NAME : CF6. Land Purchase adjacent to the A Street Homeless Shelter Project Description: In FY 18/19 ACBH used its AB 114 CFTN funds to purchase a small plot of land next to the A Street Homeless Shelter, which ACBH has been operating in Hayward since 1988. The subject lot is located at 22385 Sonoma Street immediately adjacent to the existing A Street Shelter. FY 22/23 Progress: ACBH, through the General Services Agency (GSA), successfully purchased the land in January 2019. ACBH had planned to use the lot as additional parki ng, providing approximately 20 additional spaces to augment the inadequate parking capacity needed to serve employees, residents, visitors and service vehicles. However, through a feasibility study, the cost to develop the parking lot was estimated to be $2.5M for drainage, electrical, fencing, new walkway, etc. Due to funding limitations, ACBH does not have the funding to support the parking lot project. Since there is a small balance remaining in this workplan there has been a joint decision between ACB H and the Office of Homeless Care and Coordination to pivot and transform the space into a garden and gathering space for shelter clients. The operator of the shelter, Building Opportunities for Self Sufficiency (BOSS) , and shelter clients will be involve d with the development of the space. More information on the implementation and completion of the garden project will be available in the next MHSA Plan Update FY 24/25 . PROJECT NAME : TN1. MHSA Technology Project Program Description: Purchase, installation, design, development, and maintenance of a new Behavioral Health Practice Management System ( EHR) to include: Medi -Cal Short -Doyle billing, managed care, claims processing, client referral, registration, data interoperability and functions as needed to support clinical and fiscal operations of ACBH. Additional support for staff during the implementation process, and other dependent projects that provide access to consumers and family members to their personal health information and other welln ess and recovery supports. FY 22/23 Progress: ACBH has utilized CFTN funds to develop and implement the Practice Management billing module of the EHR. Since April 2021, ACBH has been partnering with the vendor Streamline Healthcare Solutions, LLC, to formally initiate the effort to provide a fully integrated billing system on the SmartCare Platform to replace INSYST (the department's current registration and billing platform). Streamline and the integrated SmartCare Platform will incorporate all the functionality necessary to ensure staff and contracted providers work together within and across organizational boundaries. SmartCare will also provide our system with options to resolve system challenges and facilitate enhanced flexibility for data sharing.

The process focuses on the performance of various A lameda County Behavioral Health Care services (ACBH ) units that support the administration of MHSA , MHSA funded programs and services, employees , and associated tasks. The following sections provided an overarching summary of signific ant quality assurance and improvement activities directed towards improving the administration of MHSA compo nents . Alameda Coun ty Health Care Services Agency: Results -Base d Accountability (RBA) Initiative Project IMPACT began in July 2014 as an effort that supports programs throughout the Alameda County Health Care Services Agency (HCSA) to measure and report their outcomes1. The Project IMPACT team consists of a total of 17 program staff and managers from every Department in HSCA, including members who have worked closely with the RBA implementation efforts in their own Departments. The Agency Leadership Team (ALT), which incl udes the Agency Director of HCSA and the Directors, Deputy Directors and Finance Directors of each of the Agency's departments, is monitoring and guiding the development of Project IMPACT. RBA is a program evaluation framework that is data -driven and uses a simple iterative process to help organizations assess current performance, identify strategies to improve, and facilitate rapid implementation of action plans. Since 2014, ACBH has been utilizing RBA in various capacit ies to monitor program performance and assess impacts on the clients who come into contact with department and/or contracted services. ACBH has integrated RBA into MHSA contracting efforts with Full-Service Partnerships ( FSPs ), adopted the framework as part of its P revention & Early Intervention (PEI) services evaluation, and made strides to include it as part of the Juvenile Justice Center and Crisis Services program work. A summary of RBA examples for MHSA are included in Appendix C -1. Alameda County Behavioral Health Department Ini tiatives Reorganization Efforts . ACBH conducted a thorough inventory of all contractual and legal obligations for the administration and delivery of behavioral health care services2 . ACBH leaders examined the requirements included in three contracts with the California Department of Health Care Services , and interviewed A CBH managers in an effort to understand current strengths and challenges staff face in fulfilling our obligations. At the conclu sion of this process , ACBH has hired the following new key positions: Two Deputy Directors : Including the Plan Administrator who oversee s and create linkages among ACBHS's core admini strat ive func tions (e.g. MHSA, quality Improvement/Quality Management, Information Systems, and financial Services) 1 Project IMPACT (2016).

ACBH has also launched strategic planning activities which will begin 2023 until 2028. Alameda County Behavioral Health: Trauma Informed Systems Initiative ACBH's Trauma -Informed Systems (TIS) efforts have focused primarily on the training components of the Healing Systems of Care Conceptual framework - establishing a cohort of embedded trainers within A CBH and training staff in the TIS 101 foundational curriculum. TIS is in the beginning stages of adapting the training so that i t's more responsive to the needs of staff during this period of sheltering -in-place Over the next three years , ACBH and Trauma Transformed (T2) will shift focus towards the practice change and leadership components of the framework. In particular, T2 will support the creation of an ACBH cohort of champions and catalysts who will gather new and existing data from ACBH to determine priorities for policy and practice change within ACBH. TIS hope s to work more directly with ACBH leadership - directors, managers and supervisors - to increase their understanding of TIS principles and implement best practices for leading others in a trauma -informed way. The goal of all these activities is to help ACBH move closer to being a healing organization. The overarching benefit of these activities will be to improve collaboration within ACBH and with their MHSA contractors, to t ake more proactive steps to include contractor and community voice in decision - PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT INITIATIVES719 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG | 3 making, and to anticipate and work to prevent predictable stresses, harm and trauma experienced by ACBH staff, MHSA contractors, and community members . Financ ial Services Division The MHSA Trust Fund Account (MHSA Trust) was established to maintain the MHSA monthly allocation and interest earnings. All expenditures are charged to the County General Fund (CGF) with the related MHSA program code. Finance prepares a quarterly projection report to identify the net MHSA revenue, and then develop a journal to move funds from the MHSA Trust to the CGF to offset the expenditures. Finance has assigned a MHSA Plan number for each plan component and its projects; and have set up 29 program codes in the County financial system to associate with the MHSA projects. For community - based organizations/providers (CBO), the Division assigns a reporting unit number (RU#) for their projects. The program codes and RU#s can be used t o keep track the payment status. In each fiscal year, the Finance Division create s what is called The Green Sheet to identify all MHSA projects for that year including the Plan number , total budget, MHSA budget portion, estimated Medi - Cal revenue, program code and reporting unit (RU) #. The provided data helps support the preparation of the MHSA Plan and the Annual Revenue and Expenditure Report to the Department of Health Care Services. Communication. Finance establishes monthly meetings with the ACBH Leadership Team to provide information, discuss issues and concerns , and communicate with the MHSA Director for relevant updates. Fiscal Accountability . The Finance Division follows a set of policies an d procedures to avoid supplantation of MHSA funding. All expenditures, encumbrances and revenue are reconciled every quarter, as part of the quarterly projections process. The Division requires two signatures when signing housing assistance checks over $5, 000. Each Invoice and deposit require one signature. Procurement & Contract Co mpliance Activities The ACBH Contracts Unit operates under the auspice of the Finance Division . The Contracts Unit is undergoing an organizational restructure in which all contracts will reside within th is Unit. These changes are part of an overall response to federal and state health care policy changes which affect county behavioral health in California. In order to meet the demands of these changes, ACBH is proactively preparing to adapt to and thrive in the new behavioral health environment by more fully aligning ACBH's compliance with the following federal and state requirements: The state -county Mental Health Plan Contract, Performance Contract, and Drug Medi -Cal Contr act; PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT INITIATIVES720 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG | 4 Expanded Federal Medicaid Managed Care regulations; and Expanded covered services and contract requirements in Drug Medi -Cal. The Contracts Office has seven Program Contract Managers also known as Program Specialists and eight Fiscal Contract Managers. Each Contract Manager manages between three and fifteen MHSA funded programs. The Contracts Office has one Program Contract Manager who serves as the liaison between the Contracts Unit and the ACBH MHSA Division. In this role the Contract Manager rev iews the MHSA plan and updates, coordinates with the MHSA staff on reporting requirements and timelines, coordination of audit requirements on behalf of the Contracts Unit and communicates emerging changes that would impact the Contracts Unit. Roles & Responsibilities . Contract Managers are responsible for monitoring programs from various aspects; Fiscal: reviewing units of services from the electronic claiming system in comparison to the allocation. Program: technical assistance (phone calls, meetings, or emails), reviewing reports (quarterly or annually) against the contracted deliverables. Performance Measures . Contract Managers work in collaboration with the MHSA staff, and the provider to develop process, quality, and impact objectives for each type o f program. For example, Full -Service Partnership s (FSP s) are measuring the percent of providers who can achieve a 50% reduction in the following: 1. Psychiatric hospitalization admissions 2. Psychiatric hospital days and 3. Psychiatric emergency visits 12 months prior to FSP admission and 12 months post admission. Additional metrics have been implemented more recently tied to a pay for performance fiscal model. Contract Compliance. ACBH formalized a policy in June 2018, \" Contract Compliance Plan and Sanctions for ACBH Contracted Providers \". This policy supports ACBH in holding providers accountable for implementing County, State, and Federal requirements. Examples may include by not limited to: lack of achievement in meeting performance standards, substantive underperformance on meeting contracted deliverables, failure to meet contrac tual requirements such as staffing, timelines, required certifications and/or licensure. Additionally, ACBH responded to an audit finding in 2017 which resulted in the development of the MHSA Monitoring Guidelines in 2018 to strengthen the process in which ACBH are monitoring MHSA funded programs. MHSA Data Management Systems ACBH uses a web- based data and outcome reporting system called YellowFin. MHSA staff partnered with System of Care staff and the ACBH Data Services team to update the FSP outcome s dashboard to include the Service Teams. The Service Team impact metrics are used for the FY 20/21 Report and to make decisions on transforming the teams. The reporting dashboard cover s hospitalizations, incarcerations, primary care linkage, and system costs. The Service Teams were added because of the success of the FSP dashboard . The Underserved Ethnic Language Programs (UELPs), Evaluation Workgroup has finished it's first round of changes to the yearly UELP evaluation. The workgroup redesigned the logic model and worked with a graphic designer to create a graphic al version of it and re -worded and updated both the Pre/Post Health Assessment and Participant Satisfaction Surveys. Both of these have been implemented during FY 21/22 using Survey Monkey and the r esults will be used during the evaluation. PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT INITIATIVES721 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG | 5 During the FY 18/19 I n Home Outreach T eams (IHOT) evaluation, the need for a dashboard in Yellowfin was identified to track client's discharge outcomes , how long the client works with the IHOT, and pre -IHOT and post -IHOT hospitalizations , incarcerations, crisis and subacute admissions . The IHOT Program Specialists is now using the dashboard to track the clients in the program and their outcomes. Prevention & Early Intervention (PEI) Unit Performance Efforts The MHSA PEI Unit is committed to working in collaboration with contracted providers to identify program outcomes and evaluation processes that are aligned with MHSA and the PEI system's values and regulatory requirements . In an effort to foster the system's \"voice and choice,\" we're working together with providers in a trauma -informed way to: Create a safe space where individuals and providers can share their experiences, challenges and frustrations, and knowledge regarding data collecti on, reporting, and evaluation; Form work groups that include direct service/outreach staff to assess the utility, feasibility, propriety, and accuracy (CDC evaluation standards) of the evaluation processes and survey instruments; Invite accountability to e nsure that evaluation activities are culturally and linguistically relevant and promote equity and accessibility; Explore non -Westernized, community -oriented ideas of how to invite feedback and uplift participants unique perspectives and experiences; Build strong relationships and transparency with providers during virtual site visits by offering support and assistance, and Keep providers up to date about MHSA/PEI data requirements and updated regulations. MHSA Audit The Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) conducted its abridged review of Alameda County's Mental Health Services Act (MHSA) program on March 24, 2020. Alameda County's strengths include: \"The expansion of FSP program capacity to provide coordination and community -based care services, \" A multitude of diverse Prevention and Early Intervention (PEI) programs specifically focused on underserved ethnic and linguistic populations , and The County has also shown strength in the Workforce Education and Training (WET) compo nent offering internships, educational pathways and loan repayment programs. Alameda County challenges include a severe lack of housing and resources to meet the needs of homeless populations within the community, merging diverse PEI programing into one system, leadership changes within behavioral health and other public agencies, and \"lengthy procurement and contracting processes.\" Areas where Alameda County will focus on strengthen ing our transparency and consistency of MHSA funded programs and their p olicies & procedures include: Increased description and documentation of the Community Program Planning Process (CPPP) within the Three -Year Plan and/or Plan Update; PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT INITIATIVES722 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG | 6 Increased description and documentation of the local review and approval process within t he Three -Year Plan and/or Plan Update, and Tracking that 51% or more of Prevention and Early Intervention component funds are spent on youth 0 to 25 y ears of age, and Developing a policy and procedure document on the referral structure and service components of a Full -Service Partnership.

In many jurisdictions, individuals with mental illness are more likely to be booked into jail than engaged in treatment, and jails have become the largest mental health institutions. This issue is exacerbated because the legal threshold to arrest and incarcerate someone is lower than is the legal threshold to engage that same individual in treatment if they are unwilling or unable to participate on a voluntary basis. Because t he legal standard for incarceration is much lower than the threshold for involuntary treatment and jail beds are more readily available than treatment beds, either volunta ry or involuntary , it has become increasingly common to incarcerate individuals in need of mental health services.1 Despite intentional efforts to make the mental health system as accessible and recovery -oriented as possible, there remains a group of indiv iduals who will not engage in voluntary services and are more likely to be incarcerated than treated by the community behavioral health system. Once a person with SMI and/or SUD becomes justice -involved, they are more likely to remain involved and penetrat e the justice system further2, 3. These individuals typically have minimal financial resources and are more likely to be held in jail awaiting trial or placement for treatment, including competency restoration. They may experience difficulty complying with the terms and conditions of probation or release, and they may be charged with a new criminal offense while confined in jail. Within California and across the Nation, there is a concerted effort to identify diversion opportunities and to ensure a continuu m of services for individuals with mental health issues who are involved with the criminal justice system. Alameda County, along with its partners and community of stakeholders, has invested substantial time and resources on a number of efforts that aim to strengthen forensic and reentry mental health services for people with mental health needs and/or substance use disorders by: 1 National Sheriff's Association and Treatment Advocacy Center.

Johnson litigation (Mar. 19, 2002) \u0003 768 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG 3 The department unveiled a Forensic and Reentry Services Plan4 in May of 2 021 and has been systematically working through the short, mid, and long terms actions set forth in the plan. Alameda County was interested in how Innovation funds could assist in addressing the forensic and reentry mental health needs in the County. This Innovation plan arose out of the se concerted efforts to divert individuals with mental health challenges from the justice system into mental health services and was developed for and by community stakeholders , including the County's Justice Involved Ment al Health Task Force . Proposed Project Project Description The Alternatives to Incarceration continuum of services is a collection of three co -located services that are working together intended to prevent incarceration and divert individuals from the criminal justice system into the mental health services. This continuum of services specifically seeks to divert individuals from incarceration in three primary ways : 1. When a mental health c onsumer who is forensically involved begins to exhibit early warning signs of a crisis with behaviors that may lead to police contact, 2. At the moment of police contact that may result in arrest, and 3. When the person has fallen out of compliance with their probation or parole and is subject to re -arrest. This continuum of services seeks to provide services that prevent individuals with mental health and criminal justice involvement from being booked into the jail . Services include the following three progr ams. Forensic Crisis Residential Treatment (CRT). The Forensic CRT will provide a voluntary, unlocked alternative to hospitalization and/or incarceration for individuals with 4 http://www.acgov.org/board/bos_calendar/documents/DocsAgendaReg_5_10_21/HEALTH%20CARE%2 0SERVICES/Regular%20Calendar/Item__1_ACBH_Services_Forensic_sys_5_10_21.pdf Safely diverting people from the justice system into treatment, Stabilizing and connecting individuals in custody to community behavioral health services, and Promoting service participation that reduces recidivism.APPENDIX D-1 MHSA INN: INN THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG 4 mental health and criminal justice involvement who require services to re -stabilize and address the issues that place them at higher risk for police contact and/or an involuntary hold or arrest. While this may seem similar to the Muriel Wright Center in neighboring Santa Clara County, Muriel Wright is intended to provide crisis resi dential services for individuals who receive services through their criminal justice mental health program while Alameda County's proposed CRT is intended to divert individuals with mental health issues from the criminal justice system, regardless of wheth er or not they are already enrolled in forensic mental health services. While they are both forensic CRTs, Alameda County's proposed program serves to test a different function within the system for individuals who may or may not already be enrolled in pu blic mental health services. This program will provide 24/7 mental health services and supports that address mental health, substance use, and criminogenic needs in an unlocked environment. The average length of stay will span 5 -14 days with the opportuni ty to extend up to 30 days with Mental Health Plan approval, and the total capacity will be 16. The Forensic CRT will be licensed by Community Care Licensing as a Short Term Social Rehabilitation Facility and certified by Medi -Cal. The Forensic CRT woul d be available to consumers who are beginning to experience early warning signs of a crisis or other behaviors that place them at high likelihood of police contact. At the Forensic CRT, individuals would be able to stabilize from the crisis and address th e issues that were increasing the likelihood of police contact. The facility will accept consumers ages 18 -59 with mental health and criminal justice involvement who meet medical necessity criteria for crisis residential services and do not require servi ces in a locked setting. This program is intended to be a step up from the community as well as step down from a locked environment, and referrals may come from community mental health providers who are serving justice -involved mental health consumers as well as providers from jail mental health, psychiatric hospitals, psychiatric emergency services, local emergency departments, crisis stabilization units, sobering centers and detoxification units, and the arrest diversion program described below. It is also possible that the Forensic CRT will also accept transfers from the existing CRTs if there is an individual with criminogenic needs that would be better served in a forensic environment. Arrest Diversion/Triage Center. The arrest diversion/triage center is a centrally located program where law enforcement officers can bring someone with a serious mental illness who would otherwise be arrested in order to avoid the jail booking and engage the person in other services. This program is unlocked and is not intended to accept individuals who require services in a locked environment. The arrest diversion center is open 24/7 and staffed with a clinical program supervisor , case managers, and certified forensic peer specialists. When a person is brought to the arrest diversion center, they are welcomed APPENDIX D-1 MHSA INN: INN THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG 5 and offered a snack or other supports to help them feel comfortable and address any imminent basic needs. Once they have settled, the case manager meets with the individual to unde rstand the person's situation and what short term interventions may be most successful in helping the person address whatever issues contributed to law enforcement contact. They may also identify longer term supports that may be useful. Based on this ass essment and the person's preferences and willingness to participate, the case manager will make arrangements with and for the person to obtain the agreed upon short term services. They may also complete referrals for the longer term supports, if it makes sense to do so. While there are other programs that provide diversion from the criminal justice system into treatment, the programs are 1) either led by the justice system or 2) if they are led my mental health staff, they are placed in a crisis or emerge ncy setting. Alameda County's proposed arrest diversion/triage center differs from other models in that it is not a crisis or hospital setting, and mental health staff will provide assessment, brief intervention, and service coordination to engage the per son in services that help them address the issues that led to the police contact and promote their mental health. The County, through its stakeholder -led Justice Involved Mental Health Taskforce and Sequential Intercept Mapping Process, has prioritized t he need to divert arrest for individuals with mental health challenges in Alameda County. One of the identified barriers to pre -arrest diversion is a location where law enforcement officers can take someone to obtain services that will reduce the likeliho od of subsequent police contact. This service provides that alternative drop off location and realigns the need for assessment and case planning back to mental health staff who can determine what a person's needs and preferences are and link them to the a ppropriate programs and interventions. Reducing Probation/Parole Violations (RP/PV) . People with significant mental health challenges often struggle to comply with the terms and conditions of release and may be more likely to be re -incarcerated as a resu lt of a parole or probation violation. Additionally, providers appear hesitant to interact with the justice system on behalf of their consumers for fear of triggering additional legal challenges for the people they serve. This program provides educational materials and training for mental health providers who work with mental health consumers who are involved with the justice system in order to build their capacity to support the people they work with. Specifically, providers will learn how to support cons umers they're working with to comply with the terms and conditions of their release and build the skills and knowledge to help consumers negotiate with their parole or probation officers on how to come into compliance with the terms and conditions of their release without being reincarcerated . APPENDIX THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG 6 In the training, mental health providers will learn how work with consumer s to understand their forensic history, what terms and conditions they have failed to comply with, how they understand why they have failed t o comply, what services they have been participating in to address their mental health and criminogenic risk and needs, and what services they are willing to participate in. Staff will also learn how to develop a plan for reaching out to the parole or pro bation officer with the goal or coming into compliance with the terms and conditions of release without \"being violated\" or having to be booked into the jail . Staff will also learn how to negotiat e directly with the probation or parole officer on behalf of or in partnership with the consu mer. Additionally, this program will also support providers to increase knowledge of and comfort in working with legal entities to resolve parole and probation violations. Project General Requirements The Alt ernatives to Confinement continuum of services both adapts an existing mental health practice for the forensic mental health population as well as adapts practices from other disciplines. The Forensic CRT borrows the CRT model, which provide s an alternat ive treatment setting for people who do not require services in a locked environment to stabilize from a crisis and return to their community. While there is a strong evidence base for reducing avoidable hospitalization for people experiencing mental healt h crisis, the CRT model has not been piloted for people experiencing crisis who are at risk of arrest or incarceration as a result of their mental health and criminogenic needs . This continuum of services seeks to test whether or not a forensic -focused CRT would reduce incarceration for people experiencing mental health issues that place them at high likelihood of police contact . The continuum of services would also measure the extent to the extent to which the program can connect people to ongoing mental h ealth services, thereby decreasing the likelihood of future justice involvement. Currently, Alameda County has three CRTs for individuals with mental health issues that are experiencing crisis but do not require services in a locked environment. These pro grams have been successful in preventing avoidable hospitalization and connecting individuals to longer term mental health services and supports. The proposed Forensic CRT would provide the same level of mental health supervision but integrate services th at address substance use and other criminogenic risk and need to support mental health consumers who are justice involved. The Arrest Diversion Center is inspired by triage models from other disciplines. For example, the triage model is used across emergency and jail environments to quickly determine level of need and obtain that level of care. San Francisco used this type o f model specifically in their juvenile justice system to avoid booking youth into their juvenile hall. The Centralized Assessment and Referral Center (CARC) operated by Huckleberry APPENDIX THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG 7 Youth Programs accepted juveniles from police officers and would meet with them and their families to assess their need s and connect them to ongoing services and supports. Contra Costa County used a similar model for individuals experiencing homelessness out of their multi -service drop -in centers (MSCs) where police could transp ort an individual to a service center rather than book them into the jail. Once at the MSCs, homeless individuals could access a variety of tangible supports (e.g., laundry, shower, food) as well as obtain an assessment and service linkages and referrals. However, these types of programs are rarely led by the mental health system, and when they are mental health led, they are typically set up as an urgent care center or crisis stabilization unit , are subject to rules and regulations for those environments , and do not have or are unable to maintain a specific forensic focus. This program intends to maintain a low barrier for police drop off and service provision with the singular focus to quickly connect mental health consumers with services that will redu ce the likelihood of police contact or re -arrest , which may include partnering or negotiating with their family and other natural supports to develop a plan. The RP/PV program also takes an existing type of program used across the justice system and appl ies it specifically to mental health consumers. Santa Cruz has a large and highly successful Reducing Revocations program for individuals on community supervision, and San Joaquin County has significantly reduced their incidence of probation violations resulting in re -arrest as a result of this type of intervention. This program will specifically apply that successful intervention to mental health consumers to determine if the RP/PV training can reduce re -arrest for individuals on community supervision as well as increase the rates of successful probation/parole completion for mental health consumers. Individuals to be Served Overall, the Alternatives to Confinement continuum of services will serve 2,279 individuals per year. The arrest diversion center will serve approximately 1,825 individuals per year. This assumes that there will be about 5 individuals per day who are diverted from arrest and jail booking to the center. We expect to serve approximately 700 individuals in the Forensic CRT per year. This assumes that the 16 bed Forensic CRT will operate at 85% capacity with an average length of stay of one week. We also expect to serve about 40 providers in the RP/PV program . However, we anticipate that there is significant overlap between the progr ams. This continuum of services will serve transition age youth ages 18 -25 and adults ages 26 and up who have significant mental health issues and are involved with the criminal justice system; they may also have co -occurring substance use issues. They ma y be of any gender or gender identity as well as sexual orientation. We anticipate that consumers will APPENDIX D-1 MHSA INN: INN THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG 8 be predominantly Black or African American with smaller percentages of people who are white, Latinx, or Asian, Pacific Islander, and American Indian. This is based on demographic data of consumers receiving services at Adult Forensic Behavioral Health, which is the outpatient clinic located inside the County jail, as demonstrated in Table 1. We also anticipate that a proportion of individuals will spea k Spanish and other languages and will ensure language access is available. Research on INN Project The issue of individuals with serious mental illness who are involved with the justice system has become one of the largest problems facing communities across the nation, and the rate of individuals with serious mental illness is two to six times higher among incarcerated populations than it is in the general population.5 Research clearly demonstrates that outcomes for people with mental illness who become justice involved are better when diverted into treatment than when in custody. The Sequential Interc ept Model (SIM)6 is a conceptual framework that defines a series of opportunities to divert individuals who have contact with or are involved with the criminal justice system into \u0003Cloud, David, and Chelsea Davis. Treatment Alternativ es to Incarceration for People with Mental Health Needs in the Criminal Justice System: The Cost -Savings Implications. THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG 9 treatment. The SIM framework provides a system -wide way in which to organize interventions and resources in order to maximize diversion into treatment at each intercept. Risk Needs Responsivity (RNR)7 represents an approach to effective interventions within the justice system that allows for a wide variety of programs, services, and interventions to be used. The risk principle states that services should be targeted to the assessed risk of reoffending. The needs principle states that treatment should target assessed criminogenic needs. The responsivity principle states that treatm ent should be tailored to meet the specific learning style, motivation, abilities, and strengths of the individual. Essentially, RNR states that treatment and supervision decisions should be based on assessed risk and need. The Alternatives to Incarcerat ion continuum of services co-locates three services that are intended to divert individuals from being arrested and/or booked into the jail in order to divert them into treatment. Using models from mental health and other disciplines, these three interven tions collectively provide an opportunity to divert forensic mental health consumers from police contact that may result in being detained, from being arrested or booked into the jail if detained, and from being re -arrested if unable to comply with the terms and conditions of their release. These priorities for diversion arose out of the sequential intercept mapping process with Alameda County's Justice Involved Mental Health Task Force and focus on preventing entry into the criminal justice system as well as promoting exit from the criminal justice system. They are based on the RNR principles in that they do not prescribe a single approach but instead provide opportunities to assess both behavioral health and RNR principles and develop service plans that connect individuals with services that are likely to address behavioral health and criminogenic risk and need as well as reduce the likelihood of sustained or future criminal justice involvement. At this time, no other jurisdiction has developed a singul arly focused Forensic CRT or applied a reducing revocations approach to people with serious mental illness. People with forensic mental health needs may be served in CRT models or general reducing revocation programs, but none specialize in the intersecti on between behavioral health and justice system involvement and specifically target behavioral health and criminogenic risk and need. While there are myriad versions of a triage center across the nation, none are led by the mental health system, and none are exclusively focused on arrest diversion for people with serious mental illness. To this end, this continuum of services aims to explore the extent to which these programs are able to reduce criminal justice system 7 Andrews , D., Bonta , J., & Hoge , R. (1990). Classification for effective rehabilitation. Criminal Justice and Behavior , 17, 1 9-52. https://doi.org/10.1177/0093854890017001004 THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG 10 involvement for people with serious m ental illness (e.g., reduced jail bookings, reduced revocations, increased exit from community supervision). Learning Goals/Project Aims In Alameda County, 25% of ACBH consumers receive mental health services in the jail, and 10% of consumers only receive mental health services in the jail.8 This highlights the need to address the over -incarceration of people with mental health issues and support them outside of a jail environment as a key County priority. This continuum of services , along with th e other Innovation Plan entitled Peer Led Continuum of Forensic Mental Health Services, is one element of a larger Forensic Mental Health and Reentry Plan and represents the service offerings that are relevant to and meet criteria for Innovation projects. With this continuum of services , Alameda County Behavioral Health seeks to pilot these three co -located services to understand the extent to which these programs, separately and together, increase access to and participation in mental health services for adults with mental health and criminal justice involvement; improve outcomes, including reduced jail bookings, jail days, and probation/parole violations; and increase knowledge and collaboration between mental health and criminal justice providers and ag encies. For the Forensic CRT, we hope to learn the extent to which the Forensic CRT is able to prevent avoidable jail bookings and jail bed days at the moment of intervention as well as following CRT participation. We also hope to learn the extent to wh ich individuals engage in ongoing mental health services following CRT discharge. These are similar to the expected outcomes of a non -forensic CRT except they substitute jail bookings and bed days for crisis and hospitalization. Similarly, we hope to le arn the extent to which law enforcement officers are willing to divert individuals to the arrest diversion center in lieu of booking them into the jail therefore resulting in reduced jail bookings. We also hope to explore if and how individuals participat e in ongoing mental health services following participation at the arrest diversion center and whether or not they remain in the community or are re - arrested. We also hope to learn more about their assessed level of need and referred level of care to bett er share system capacity needs for ongoing program planning. Finally, we hope to learn whether or not a concerted effort to reduce parole and probation violations for people with serious mental illness reduces booking individuals into the jail as a resul t of parole or probation violation. We also hope to learn the extent to which the program results in increased knowledge, understanding, and collaboration amongst probation and parole \u0003 http://www.acgov.org/board/bos_calendar/documents/DocsAgendaReg_5_10_21/HEALTH%20CARE%2 0SERVICES/Regular%20Calendar/Item__1_ACBH_Services_Forensic_sys_5_10_21.pdf THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG 11 Evaluation or Learning Plan This Alternatives to Confinement continuu m of services evaluation will explore process and outcome measures related to the three co -located services. The overarching evaluation questions include: 1. What resources are being invested, by whom, and how much? 2. Who is being served, at what dosage, and in what ways , including participation in more than one INN -funded service? 3. To what extent do people who participate in INN -funded services experience reduced jail bookings, jail days, and parole/probation revocations? 4. To what extent to people who participate in INN -funded services experience increased service engagement and participation? 5. How does knowledge, understanding, and collaboration between mental health and criminal justice agencies change over the course of the project? What activities and experiences promote or detract from the working relationship? The evaluation will explore the following types of quantitative data: Socio -demographics of individuals served, including race/ethnicity, age, gender identity, sexual orientation, zip code, income type and amount, housing status, level of education, and veteran status. Clinical and justice involved profile of individuals served, including mental health diagnoses and previous service participation; previous arrest, charge, and booking information; substance use and misuse; known trauma history; other clinically relevant information. Current program and service participation, including program, service type, procedure code, provider type, dates of service , length of encounter, length of episode , disposition . This includes for INN -funded programs as well as all other MHP -funded services, such as crisis and hospitalization as well as other residential and outpatient services. Current justice system interaction s, including jail bookings and discharge dates, charges filed, court dispositions. If feasible, police contact and arrest data that did not result in a jail booking may also be included. Referrals, including referrals sources into the INN -funded program s as well as referrals and linkages provided from the INN -funded programs into other mental health services. Experience of services from consumers, family, behavioral health providers, and justice professionals. APPENDIX D-1 MHSA INN: INN THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG 12 Perception of knowledge, understanding, an d collaboration between behavioral health providers and justice professionals. Quantitative data will be collected directly from the County's Electronic Health Record, the Sherriff's Office via existing Memorandum of Understanding, the Community Health Record funded through the Whole Person Care Initiative, and via data request to the courts. Experience of services and perception of knowledge, understanding, and collaboration will be collected via interviews and focus groups; there may also be a brief survey developed for service recipients and their families or involved professionals. Data will be collected on an ongoing basis and reported annually to providers and partners in order to support communications and continuous quality improvement as well as to the Mental Health Services Oversight and Accountability Commission (MHSOAC) in order to meet INN reporting requirements. Section 3: Additional Information for Regulatory Requirements Contracting The County expects to contract the Forensic CRT to a community -based provider and may also choose to contract for the other services. Additionally, the County intends to contract for an external evaluator for this project to work with our internal data support team in exploring the learning goals and evalu ation questions listed above as well as complete required reporting for the project. The County will appoint a contract monitor for each of these contracts to ensure contract compliance as well as a portion of the County project/program manager to supervi se the quality of work performed. Community Project Planning These projects arose out of a longer term planning and system improvement process dedicated to improving services for justice involved mental health consumers. The Justice Involved Mental Health (JIMH) Task Force included representatives from the Health Care Services Agency, Alameda County Behavioral Health, Public Defender, District Attorney, provider and advocacy organizations, consumer and family representatives, faith based and other communit y leaders. After a more than year long process, the JIMH Task Force published a report in September 2020 with multiple stakeholder recommendations, including a focus on preventing law enforcement contact and arrest diversion , among other suggestions. Con currently, ACBH published a Forensic Mental Health and Reentry Plan in October 2020 that was informed by JIMH APPENDIX D-1 THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG 13 and included additional actions informed by evidence based practice and ACBH's strategic direction. During 2021, ACBH systematically went throug h the Forensic Mental Health and Reentry Plan and identified aspects of the plan that either warranted further development and/or consideration or may meet criteria for INN funds. As a part of this process, ACBH contracted with the Indigo Project to engag e in INN Project planning. The Indigo Project met with a number of internal and external stakeholders to gather information and workshop the ideas and concepts as they evolved , including: Consumer representatives and members of the Pool of Consumer Champions Family representatives and individuals from NAMI Providers who represent communities who are underrepresented because of cultural affiliation and language access Members of the African American subcommittee Members of the MHSA Stakeholder group Healthcare for the homeless providers System of Care Directors for Adult, Crisis, and Forensic Mental Health Services Consumer and Family Empowerment Managers With each discussion, the concepts evolved and were further developed and clarified. These proje cts will be included in the MHSA Annual Update Community Program Planning (CPP) process in 2022 with the hopes of beginning implementation in FY2022. MHSA General Standards This project arose out of a community effort to address the needs of mental healt h consumers who are forensically involved. It was developed by consumers, family, and communities to support wellness and recovery and avoid incarceration. This project arose out of a community effort to address the needs of mental health consumers who ar e forensically involved. It was developed by consumers, family, and communities to support wellness and recovery and avoid incarceration. Community collaboration is exemplified in not only how this project was developed but also in how the project itself works to keep individuals within their communities rather than removing them and placing them in a jail environment. Cultural Competency is included as a foundational component in that this project seeks to address the o verincarceration of people with mental illness, the majority of whom are BIPOC individuals , by preventing police contact and jail booking as well as supporting individuals to successfully exit the justice system. Additionally, the services themselves will be informed by and primarily staffed by individuals who represent our County's diverse populations. Services will be APPENDIX D-1 THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG 14 client and family driven in that services aim to preserve a person's freedom, independence, and ability to consent to their own services by using person centered planning with family member input that respects an individual's needs and preferences and works in partnership with each individual and their family to discover how they understand the issues that they're facing and helps them deve lop a plan that they are willing to do to address what is most important to them. The services are wellness, recovery, and resiliency focused in that they are built upon the belief that participation in mental health services is more productive and meanin gful than incarceration and that services that respect an individual's ability to invest in their own recovery journey are more likely to result in sustained freedom than \"rehabilitation \" provided by the jails. Finally, services are intended to be integra ted in that these programs seek to strengthen collaboration between mental health and justice organizations so that individuals and families can streamline efforts and communication between mental health services and criminal justice requirements in order to promote community -based recovery and minimize or avoid criminal justice involvement. Cultural Competence and Stakeholder Participation in Evaluation On a quarterly basis, ACBH will convene a stakeholder meeting with individuals who are invested in bot h forensic mental health INN projects, which include this project and the Peer Led Continuum of Forensic Mental Health Services. This meeting will serve dual purposes to gather information from stakeholders and partners about their perspectives on the proj ect and its implementation as well as to provide data from the evaluation to support a CQI process. As a part of this project, we will explore the extent to which the project is reaching its intended target population and that people receiving services ar e reflective of the jail population (i.e., the population receiving services is comparable to the Santa Rita population in terms of race/ethnicity and age). This will be one component of what is discussed in the quarterly meetings as well as overall feedb ack and evaluation data described in the preceding section. Innovation Project Sustainability and Continuity of Care This project will primarily serve individuals with serious mental illness. If this project accomplishes its intended objectives of 1) reducing jail bookings and jail days and 2) increasing participation in ongoing mental health services , the County will continue to fund the project using a combination of MHSA Community Services a nd Supports funding and Federal Financial Participation (FFP). All of the services described in this plan should be eligible for Medi -Cal reimbursement following completion of the INN project. Communication and Dissemination Plan If this project is succ essful at 1) reducing jail bookings and jail days and 2) increasing APPENDIX D-1 MHSA INN: INN THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG 15 participation in ongoing mental health services, ACBH will apply to present learnings at California -specific conferences, including the forensic mental health association, California Institute of Behavioral Health Services, and California Association of Counties (CSAC) conferences. Additionally, ACBH will request that the contracted evaluator prepare a white paper that can be distributed through the California Behavioral Health Directors A ssociation, California Probation Officers Association, and the MHSOAC listserv. Keywords include: 1. Jail diversion 2. Pre-arrest diversion 3. Reducing revocations 4. Forensic Crisis Residential Treatment 5. Forensic mental health diversion Timeline ACBH proposes a 5 year Innovation project in which the first two years of the project allow for facility start -up. While the non -residential services may be able to be implemented more quickly, we believe that it is important to have all elements available at the same time, particularly with a co -located service model. To that end, ACBH will begin the site identification and procurement process upon MHSOAC approval. This may take up to nine months to facilitate a competitive bid process and then enter into contracts. The second year will focus on preparing the site and program for opening, including preparing the application for Community Care Licensing as well as the materials, including policies and procedures, for Medi -Cal certification. Concurrently, the evaluato rs will be working with the department and stakeholders to develop the evaluation approach. Years 3 -5 will focus on service provision as well as data collection and analysis to support learning. In the final year, ACBH will also develop an ongoing fundin g strategy using MHSA, realignment, and FFP dollars. In year 5, the evaluators will also draft the summative evaluation report and a white paper detailing project implementation, outcomes, and lessons learned.

In many jurisdictions, individuals with mental illness are more likely to be booked into jail than engaged in treatment, and jails have become the largest mental health institutions. This issue is exacerbated because the legal threshold to arrest and incarcerate someone is lower thanis the legal threshold to engage that same individual in treatment if they are unwilling or unable to participate on a voluntary basis. Because t he legal standard for incarceration is much lower than the threshold for involuntary treatment and jail beds are more readily availab le than treatment beds, either voluntary or involuntary , it has become increasingly common to incarcerate individuals in need of mental health services.1 Despite intentional efforts to make the mental health system as accessible and recovery -oriented as po ssible, there remains a group of individuals who will not engage in voluntary services and are more likely to be incarcerated than treated by the community behavioral health system. Once a person with SMI and/or SUD becomes justice -involved, they are more likely to remain involved and penetrate the justice system further2, 3. These individuals typically have minimal financial resources and are more likely to be held in jail awaiting trial or placement for treatment, including competency restoration. They ma y experience difficulty complying with the terms and conditions of probation or release, and they may be charged with a new criminal offense while confined in jail. Within California and across the Nation, there is a concerted effort to identify diversion opportunities and to ensure a continuum of services for individuals with mental health issues who are involved with the criminal justice system. Alameda County, along with its partners and community of stakeholders, has invested substantial time and resour ces on a number of efforts that aim to strengthen forensic and reentry mental health services for people with mental health needs and/or substance use disorders by: 1 National Sheriff's Association and Treatment Advocacy Center.

Alameda County was interested in how Innovation funds could assist in addressing the forensic and reentry mental health needs in the County. This Innovation plan arose out of these concerted efforts to divert individuals with mental health challenges from the justice system into mental health services and was developed for and by community stakeholders, including the County's Justice I nvolved Mental Health Task Force. Proposed Project Project Description The Peer Led Continuum of Forensic Mental Health Services is a collection of four (4) continuum of services , of which three are peer led and one is family focused. The continuum of services specifically seeks to : 1. Support mental health consumers who are justice involved by helping them transition back into the community following an arrest or incarceration, 2. Identify and address the issues that led up to their arrest and/or incarcerat ion 3. Connect with mental health and other services to support them in their recovery and reentry journey , and 4. Build the capacity of family members to advocate on behalf of their loved one with a serious mental illness who has become justice involved. As a result of the continuum of service s, we expect that individuals will experience fewer episodes of arrest and/or incarceration and will have increased participation in ongoing mental health and other services. The included services are described below. 4 http://www.acgov.org/board/bos_calendar/documents/DocsAgendaReg_5_10_21/HEALTH%20CARE%2 0SERVICES/Regular%20Calendar/Item__1_ACBH_Services_Forensic_sys_5_10_21.pdf Safely diverting people from the justice system into treatment, Stabilizing and connecting individuals in custody to community behavioral health services, and Promoting service participation that reduces recidivism.788 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG 4 Reentry Coaches. In Alameda and across the state, there have been strong outcomes associated with using people with lived experience to support individuals following a crisis or hospitalization to connect to follow -up mental health services . These individuals are sometimes referred to as peer mentors and have shown strong outcomes in increasing service linkage and reducing crisis and hospitalization in Alameda, Orange, and other counties. This project aims to employ forensic peer specialists who can serve as reentry coaches for individuals with serious mental illness to help them tran sition back into the community. Their role is to help the person with whatever they need, including tangible resources such as linkages for food and shelter or transportation to appointments , as well as encouragement and consciousness raising to actively participate in their own recovery and reentry journey. Referrals into the program may come from service providers supporting reentry planning at the Santa Rita jail, and ideally the reentry coach would be able to make contact with the individual before the y are released from jail. However, their first contact may be upon release at the Safe Landing program , which is a drop in center on site at the jail that provides information and referrals to individuals leaving the jail, or at another community location . The reentry coach will work with the individual to develop a personalized reentry plan that addressed the needs and issues that the person feels are most pressing, and the coach can stay involved for up to 90 days providing direct peer support as well a s support to engage with other services.

The Centers for Human Development have a number of curricula based on Wellness Recovery Action Planning (WRAP) for specialty populations, including individuals with mental health challenges who are involved with the criminal justice system. Existing WRAP facilitators as well as identified Forensic Peer Specialists will receive training in WRAP for Reentry. The WRAP for Reentry groups will be available at existing peer led programs as well as of fered at the peer respite, Forensic CRT (included as a part of the Alternatives to Confinement continuum of services ), and potentially at Santa Rita, if permitted. Forensic Peer Respite. The Forensic Peer Respite will be available to adult mental health c onsumers who are justice involved who would benefit from a brief moment of pause to reflect on their recovery and reentry journey, address whatever issues are coming up for them, and receive peer support to connect them with whatever services may be most h elpful to support their continued recovery and reentry. This program will provide 24/7 peer support services that address mental health, substance use, and criminogenic needs in an unlocked, peer -led environment. The average length of stay based on other peer respite s will span 5 -14 days with the opportunity to extend up to 30 days with ACBH approval, and the total capacity will be 6. The Forensic Peer Respite would be available to consumers who are beginning to experience early warning signs of a crisis or other behaviors that place them at high likelihood of police contact. APPENDIX D-2 MHSA INN: INN THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG 5 The program will accept consumers ages 18 -59 with mental health and criminal justice involvement who can be safely served in this environment. This program is intended to be a ste p up from the community as well as step down from the jail, and referrals may come from community mental health providers who are serving justice -involved mental health consumers as well as providers from jail mental health, psychiatric hospitals, psychiat ric emergency services, local emergency departments, crisis stabilization units, sobering centers and detoxification units, and the reentry coaching program described above . It is also possible that the program will also accept consumers from the Forensic CRT if there is an individual that would be better served in a peer-led environment. Family Navigation and Support. Family members of adult children with mental health issues are a critical component of supporting an individual to participate in mental health treatment and exit the justice system. However, family members have to quickly become experts in the justice system and relevant mental health law in order to understand and work within the justice system and process in support of their loved one. The family navigation and support service would develop and disseminate informational materials about the forensic mental health process. This program would collaborate and train existing warmlines , staffed by family partners, to educate and coach families on how to best advocate for their loved ones and would collaborate with ACBH to ensure information materials are translated and accessible for all Alameda C ounty residents. The program would also provide individual and group consultation to families in order to increase knowledge of the justice mental health system and the legal process; the types of specific hearings, legal mechanisms, and appeals for indivi duals with mental health issues; how competency is determined, what incompetent to stand trial means , and what services may be available ; how to provide medical and mental health information to the jail and other legal entities ; and how to advocate on beha lf of a loved one who has become involved with the criminal justice system. Project General Requirements The Peer Led Continuum of Forensic Mental Health Services both adapts an existing mental health practice for the forensic mental health population as w ell as adapts practices from other disciplines. The Forensic Peer Respite, Reentry Coaches, and WRAP for Reentry take existing mental health practices and seeks to apply them to adult mental health consumers who are involved with the criminal justice sys tem. Specifically, this continuum of services is inspired by the Peer Respite model which exists in other jurisdictions and in Alameda County, the WRAP curriculum which has a strong evidence base and has been implemented for decades in Alameda County, and peer mentoring programs who support individuals post crisis or hospitalization that are available across the state. In each of APPENDIX D-2 MHSA INN: INN THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG 6 these instances, they have been modified for a justice involved mental health population and seek to promote similar outcomes i ncluding reduced arrest and incarceration rather than crisis and hospitalization as well as increased service connectedness. The Family Navigation and Support component is modeled after other disciplines, specifically the resources and consultation avail able through advokids5 for the foster care system or Regional Centers for families with intellectual and/or developmental disabilities. These programs offer a combination of written resources, consultation, education, and support to educate families about the intricacies of the system and equip them to advocate on behalf of their family member. Individuals to be Served Overall, the Peer Led Continuum of Forensic Mental Health Services project will serve 2,279 individuals per year. We anticipate that the R eentry Coaches will serve approximately 480 individuals per year, which is 15 consumers per coach with an average engagement of 90 days and 8.0 FTE . The WRAP for Reentry program will serve approximately 960 individuals, or 20 unduplicated individuals per month per facilitator, of which there will be 4 facilitators. We expect to serve approximately 122 individuals in the Forensic Peer Respite per year . This assumes that the 6 bed Forensic Peer Respite will operate at 85% capacity with an average length of stay of two weeks . We also expect to reach about 800 families with the written resources through the Family Navigation and Support program, with about 25%, or 200 families, reaching out for consultation or other support. However, we anticipate that there is significant overlap between the programs. This continuum of services will serve transition age youth ages 18 -25 and adults ages 26 and up who have significant mental health issues and are involved with the criminal jus tice system; they may also have co -occurring substance use issues. They may be of any gender or gender identity as well as sexual orientation. We anticipate that consumers will be predominantly Black or African American with smaller percentages of people who are white, Latinx, or Asian, Pacific Islander, and American Indian. This is based on demographic data of consumers receiving services at Adult Forensic Behavioral Health, which is the outpatient clinic located inside the County jail, as demonstrated in Table 1. We also anticipate that a proportion of individuals will speak Spanish and other languages and will ensure language access is available. Additionally, the Family Navigation THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG 7 Support project will work with culturally specific organizations to ensure that they have the capacity to support individuals to advocate on behalf of their family members. Research on INN Project The issue of individuals with serious mental illness who are involved with the justice system has become one of the largest problems facing communities across the nation, and the rate of individuals with serious mental illness is two to six times higher am ong incarcerated populations than it is in the general population.6 Research clearly demonstrates that outcomes for people with mental illness who become justice involved have better outcomes when diverted into services than when in custody. Peer support has a strong evidence base for supporting individuals to reduce crisis and/or hospitalization as well as engage in mental health and other recovery based THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG 8 The Peer Led Continuum of Forensic Mental Health Services provides three peer -led and one f amily -focused services that are intended to support individuals to transition from incarceration to the community and use peer support to address whatever issues may contribute to police contact, arrest, and/or incarceration. Using models from mental health and other disciplines, these four programs collectively provide an opportunity to support individuals to reenter the community and engage in services that reduce the likelihood of future arrests and/or incarceration. These priorities for diversion arose out of the sequential intercept mapping process with Alameda County's Justice Involved Mental Health Task Force and focus on supporting reentry as well as promoting exit from the criminal justice system. They are based on t he principles of peer support provided at opportunities identified through Alameda County's Sequential Intercept Mapping process. At this time, no other jurisdiction has developed a singularly focused Forensic Peer Respite or applied a peer mentor approach to people with serious mental illness reentering from jail . While WRAP for Reentry is implemented in other jurisdictions, it does not yet have an evidence base supporting its use. People with forensic mental health needs may be served in Peer Respite, pe er mentor, or WRAP programs , but none specialize in the intersection between behavioral health and justice system involvement and specifically target behavioral health and criminal justice involvement . While there are myriad versions of parental support , none are solely focused on supporting family members whose loved ones with serious mental illness have become justice involved. To this end, this project aims to explore the extent to which these programs are able to reduce criminal justice system involve ment for people with serious mental illness (e.g., reduced jail booking s and jail days , increased service participation, increased exit from the criminal justice system ). Learning Goals/Project Aims In Alameda County, 25% of ACBH consumers receive mental health services in the jail, and 10% of consumers only receive mental health services in the jail.7 This highlights the need to address the over -incarceration of people with mental health issues and support them outside of a jail environment as a key Cou nty priority. This project, along with the other Innovation Plan entitled Alternatives to Confinement , is one element of a larger Forensic Mental Health and Reentry Plan and represents the service offerings that are relevant to and meet criteria for THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG 9 With this project, Alameda County Behavioral Health seeks to pilot these four services within a continuum of care to understand the extent to which these programs, separately and together, increase access to and participation in mental he alth services for adults with mental health and criminal justice involvement and improve outcomes, including reduced jail bookings, jail days, and exit from the criminal justice system. Evaluation or Learning Plan This Peer Led Continuum of Forensic Ment al Health Services project evaluation will explore process and outcome measures related to the four included services. The overarching evaluation questions include: 1. What resources are being invested, by whom, and how much? 2. Who is being served, at what dosage, and in what ways, including participation in more than one INN -funded service? 3. To what extent do people who participate in INN -funded services experience reduced jail bookings, jail days, and are able to exit the criminal justice system ? 4. To what ex tent do people who participate in INN -funded services experience increased service engagement and participation? 5. How does family education and consultation support individuals to move through the justice system ? The evaluation will explore the following t ypes of quantitative data: Socio -demographics of individuals served, including race/ethnicity, age, gender identity, sexual orientation, zip code, income type and amount, housing status, level of education, and veteran status. Clinical and justice involved profile of individuals served, including mental health diagnoses and previous service participation; previous arrest, charge, and booking information; substance use and misuse; known trauma history; other clinically relevant i nformation. Current program and service participation, including program, service type, procedure code, provider type, dates of service, length of encounter, length of episode, disposition. This includes for INN -funded programs as well as all other Ment al Health Plan ( MHP )-funded services, such as crisis and hospitalization as well as other residential and outpatient services. Current justice system interactions, including jail bookings and discharge dates, charges filed, court dispositions. If feasible , police contact and arrest data that did not result in a jail booking may also be included. APPENDIX D-2 MHSA INN: INN THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG 10 Referrals, including referrals sources into the INN -funded programs as well as referrals and linkages provided from the INN -funded programs into other mental health services. Experience of services from consumers, family, behavioral health providers, and justice professionals. Perception of knowledge, understanding, and collaboration between behavioral health providers and justice professionals. Quantitative data will be collected directly from the County's data services in collaboration with the Sheriff's Office via existing Memorandum of Understanding, the Community Health Record funded through the Whole Person Care Initiative, and via data request to the co urts. Experience of services and perception of knowledge, understanding, and collaboration will be collected via interviews and focus groups; there may also be a brief survey developed for service recipients and their families or involved professionals. Data will be collected on an ongoing basis and reported annually to providers and partners in order to support communications and continuous quality improvement as well as to the Mental Health Services Oversight and Accountability Commission (MHSOAC) in order to meet INN reporting requirements. Section 3: Additional Information for Regulatory Requirements Contracting The County expects to contract out all of the services included in this proposal . Additionally, the County intends to contract for an ext ernal evaluator for this project to work with our internal data support team in exploring the learning goals and evaluation questions listed above as well as complete required reporting for the project. The County will appoint a contract monitor for each of these contracts to ensure contract compliance as well as a portion of the County project/program manager to supervise the quality of work performed. Community Project Planning These projects arose out of a longer -term planning and system improvement pro cess dedicated to improving services for justice involved mental health consumers. The Justice Involved Mental Health (JIMH) Task Force included representatives from the Health Care Services Agency, Alameda County Behavioral Health, Public Defender, District Attorney, provider and advocacy organizations, consumer and family APPENDIX D-2 MHSA INN: INN THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG 11 representatives, faith based and other community leaders. After a more than year long process, the JIMH Task Force published a report in September 2020 with multiple stakeholder recomm endations, including a focus on supporting reentry . Concurrently, ACBH published a Forensic Mental Health and Reentry Plan in October 2020 that was informed by JIMH and included additional actions informed by evidence -based practice and ACBH's strategic d irection. During 2021, ACBH systematically went through the Forensic Mental Health and Reentry Plan and identified aspects of the plan that either warranted further development and/or consideration or may meet criteria for INN funds. As a part of this p rocess, ACBH contracted with the Indigo Project to engage in INN Project planning. The Indigo Project met with a number of internal and external stakeholders to gather information and workshop the ideas and concepts as they evolved, including: Consumer r epresentatives and members of the Pool of Consumer Champions Family representatives and individuals from NAMI Providers who represent communities who are underrepresented because of cultural affiliation and language access Members of the African American s ubcommittee Members of the MHSA Stakeholder group Healthcare for the homeless providers System of Care Directors for Adult, Crisis, and Forensic Mental Health Services Consumer and Family Empowerment Managers With each discussion, the concepts evolved and were further developed and clarified. These projects will be included in the MHSA Annual Update Community Program Planning (CPP) process in 2022 with the hopes of beginning implementation in FY2022. MHSA Ge neral Standards This project arose out of a community effort to address the needs of mental health consumers who are forensically involved. It was developed by consumers, family, and communities to support wellness and recovery and avoid incarceration. Community collaboration is exemplified in not only how this project was developed but also in how the project itself works to support individuals to return to and remain in their communities rather than in a jail environment. Cultural Competency is include d as a foundational component in that this project seeks to address the overincarceration of people with mental illness, the majority of whom are BIPOC individuals, by supporting individuals to reenter their communities and successfully exit the justice sy stem. Additionally, the services themselves will be informed by and primarily staffed by individuals who represent APPENDIX D-2 MHSA INN: INN THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG 12 our County's diverse populations. Services will be client and family driven in that services aim to preserve a person's freedom, independen ce, and ability to consent to their own services by using person centered planning with family member input that respects an individual's needs and preferences and works in partnership with each individual and their family to discover how they understand t he issues that they're facing and helps them develop a plan that they are willing to do to address what is most important to them. The services are wellness, recovery, and resiliency focused in that they are built upon the belief that participation in mental health services and supports are more productive and meaningful than incarceration and that services that respect an individual's ability to invest in their own recovery journey are more likely to result in sustained freedom than \"rehabilitation\" provided by the jails. Finally, services are intended to be integrated in that these programs seek to strengthen each person's ability to renter the community and successfully navigate the servic e system with peer support . Cultural Competence and Stakeholder Participation in Evaluation On a quarterly basis, ACBH will convene a stakeholder meeting with individuals who are invested in both forensic mental health INN projects, which include this pr oject and the Alternatives to Confinement continuum of services . This meeting will serve dual purposes to gather information from stakeholders and partners about their perspectives on the project and its implementation as well as to provide data from the e valuation to support a CQI process. As a part of this project, we will explore the extent to which the project is reaching its intended target population and that people receiving services are reflective of the jail population (i.e., the population receiv ing services is comparable to the Santa Rita population in terms of race/ethnicity and age). This will be one component of what is discussed in the quarterly meetings as well as overall feedback and evaluation data described in the preceding section. Innovation Project Sustainability and Continuity of Care This project with its continuum of services will primarily serve individuals with serious mental illness. If this project accomplishes its intended objectives of 1) reducing jail bookings and jail da ys and 2) increasing participation in ongoing mental health services, the County will continue to fund the project using a combination of MHSA Community Services and Supports funding and Federal Financial Participation (FFP). Most of the services describe d in this plan should be eligible for Medi -Cal reimbursement following completion of the INN project , assuming peer certification and billing for peer support continue implementation during this INN project . APPENDIX D-2 THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG 13 Communication and Dissemination Plan If this continuum of services is successful at 1) reducing jail bookings and jail days and 2) increasing participation in ongoing mental health services, ACBH will apply to present learnings at California -specific conferences, including the forensic mental health association, California Institute of Behavioral Health Services, and California Association of Counties (CSAC) conferences. Additionally, ACBH will request that the contracted evaluator prepare a white paper that can be distributed through the California B ehavioral Health Directors Association, California Probation Officers Association, and the MHSOAC listserv. Keywords include: 1. Mental health reentry 2. Forensic Peer Respite 3. WRAP for Reentry 4. Reentry Peer Support 5. Reentry Family Support Timeline ACBH propos es a 5 year Innovation project in which the first two years of the project allow for program start- up. While services may be able to be implemented more quickly, we believe that it is important to have all elements available at the same time, particularly with a service model that requires significant coordination with partner agencies . To that end, ACBH will begin the site identification and procurement process upon MHSOAC approval. This may take up to nine months to facilitate a competitive bid process and then enter into contracts. The second year will focus on preparing the program s for opening, developing written materials, and outreaching and coordinating with our justice partners . Concurrently, the evaluators will be working with the department and stakeholders to develop the evaluation approach. Years 3 -5 will focus on service provision as well as data collection and analysis to support learning. In the final year, ACBH will a lso develop an ongoing funding strategy using MHSA, realignment, and FFP dollars. In year 5, the evaluators will also draft the summative evaluation report and a white paper detailing project implementation, outcomes, and lessons learned.

Innovations are defined as novel, creative, and/or ingenious mental health practices/approaches that are expected to contribute to learning, which are developed within communities through a process that is inclusive and representative. The County requests YOUR feedback to help identify which of the THREE innovative concepts to impl ement . Please submit your suggestions by April 30, 202 2. 1. Consumer Empowerment Using DBT (Dialectical Behavioral Therapy ) The DBT project will develop an online Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) Peer to Peer training program to train peers with the ski lls of DBT. An online training program is able to provide an avenue that is self - paced, recovery -oriented mode of learning for peers to cultivate relationships with others committed to learning, practicing, educating others about, and building mastery of t he 4 DBT skill sets: core mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotion regulation, and interpersonal effectiveness. 2. Peer -led Continuum of Forensic Services The Peer -led Continuum of Forensic Services is a collection of four (4) components, three of which are peer-led and one that is family focused: Reentry Coaches, WRAP for Reentry, Forensic Peer Respite, and Family Navigation and Support . The project seeks to support mental health consumers who are justice involved transitioning back into the community . This project also seeks to build capacity of family members to advocate for loved ones with a serious mental illness who has become justice involved. 3. Alternatives to Confinement Continuum of Forensic Services The Alternatives to Incarceration Continuum of Fore nsic Services is a collection of three (3) services that work together and are intended to prevent incarceration and divert individuals from criminal justice system into mental health services. Diversion is sought when early signs of crisis occur, police c ontact which may lead to arrest, and probation or parole non -compliance. The services include : Forensic Crisis Residential Treatment, Arrest Diversion/Triage Center, and Reducing Probation/Parole Violations . 1.

The overarching goal of this program is to build capacity in the early childhood workforce by increasing the number of qualified practitioners who understand and can address the culturally diverse and specialty early childhood mental health needs of y oung children and their families in Alameda County . The reporting for the pilot follows. Program Background and Updates Background In FY18/19, California State University East Bay (CSUEB) and Alameda County Behavioral Health (ACBH) launched the pilot Early Childhood Mental Health Post Graduate Continuing Education Certificate Program ( program ), which focused on the developmental foundations of infant and early childhood mental health. The program's content examined the developmental foundations of rela tionship -based clinical work between infants, young children, families, and caregivers, and combined theory and practice. The curriculum places a strong emphasis on working with families from diverse cultural, racial, and ethnic backgrounds, which is espec ially important given Alameda County's socioeconomic, racial, cultural, ethnic, and immigrant diversity. Overview A collaborative effort allowed for the development of this partnership that aims to address an important need, an informed workforce who are culturally and linguistically informed about the challenges of the communities they will serve. For this pilot, ACB H, CSUEB, and evaluators worked to ensure programmatic coordination, recruitment, methodological design, data collection, and reporting. To address challenges identified in year one, ACBH allocated additional funding for curriculum development.

Two cohorts have been piloted through this innovative program since the program launched in late 2018. Cohort 1 occurred January 2019 through December 2020 with 14 of 15 students completing the program. Cohort 2 started in January 2021 with 15 students and will complete December 2022. It is anticipated that 11 will complete. In 2020, program administrators responded to COVID -19 concerns and moved to an online format to address safety concerns. The partnership between ACBH and CSUEB has remained strong through the pandemic as well as through some leadership changes. The instructor, Dr. Valerie Bellas CSUEB Cohort Instructor , has remained a constant strength of the program from its in ception and in the completion of this program. Various evaluation methods were used to assess the 4 year pilot program includ ing: a unique survey developed by UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland in year one; a training evaluation (online student satis faction survey); the Learning Curve Survey in year one (to assess student measurement of knowledge, skills, and integration/application of core concepts), and reflective writing assessments. From FY 20/21 and Spring 2022 evaluation data, student evaluations showed: o overall agreement that the stated learning objectives were met and that instructors were responsive, promoted the ethical and clinically sound treatment of clients. o Students felt the content was both current and accurate and that they understood the value of the program. o Students agreed that they \"...learned something useful from this program that I can put into practice in my work\". o Further, most students showed high ratings of the instructors demonstrated knowledge/qualifications and clarity of content presentation. Through student feedback, students commented on the value of increased understanding of developmental concepts such as child bids for connection and exploration as part of attachment behavior; strengthened observational skills, assessment tools, and case formulation skills, the value of reflective supervision/consultation, and application of relational models to early childhood mental health. Student comments: o \"I have always known that the relationship between caregiver and child is important, but I think I have a deeper understanding of what that means now.\" o \"I will be more thoughtful of cultural impacts on children's and families functioning and consider more ways to integrate cultural factors in treatment planning and services so that they are as relevant and respectful to each family as possible\". Student survey responses showed: o There was a range of expe rienced practioners represented including LCSWs, ASWs, and LMFTs with active licenses. o Key areas in which students strongly agreed or agreed with included feeling that this 825 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORGAPPENDIX E-3 MHSA WET: CSU EAST BAY EARLY CHILDHOOD PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2000 Embarcadero Cove, Suite 400 Oakland, Ca 94606 510-567-8100 / TTY 510 -533-5018 Karyn L.

Trained me to describ e the role of environmental stressors , including trauma, in a developmental context using 1 -2 related concepts (e.g., the role of early memory, ghosts and angels in the nursery, the impact of racism, xenophobia, and COVID -19 pandemic.) Trained me to identi fy the philosophy and key elements of family -driven care across content and processes using 1 -2 approaches to IECMH (e.g., centering fatherhood, cultural humility), and had an instructor(s) [who] demonstrated knowledge, promoted clinically sound and ethica l treatment of client/customers, and was responsive to participants. Instructor comments: o Instructor Dr. Valerie Bellas shared feedback on the program. Overall she expressed that several areas of the program have worked well including collaboration, the p edagogy, the transition to an online and subsequent hybrid learning, and the experience of the cohort learning model. . She states that \"students have acquired a foundation [in] IECMH [Infant Early Childhood Mental Health] theory and practice approach, including development in relationships, reflective practice, cultural humility, and trauma.\" She further states that she believes \"The county and university partnership is a model that can be disseminated and replicated as a model for IEMCH workforce dev elopment and training.\" Overall, students, the instructor, administrators, and community stakeholders shared that they felt that students benefitted greatly from the program and that this resource will continue to strengthen quality services offered by their providers. ACBH and CSUEB have had discussions regarding sustainability of the program beyond this pilot ending in December 2022. Various ideas are being explored including shortening the program from two years to (1st year theory and 2nd year practice to be enrolled in separately) and incorporating early childhood curriculum in order to increase exposure into other social service and educational courses and topics to expose more students to the early childhood field, which is still in ne ed of culturally astute practitioners who reflect the communities served. ACBH and CSUEB thanks the MHSA program for sponsoring this pilot. WET funds have supported these efforts as well as the complimentary evaluation services. The learning by the students and administrators will continue to inform direct and planned services to youth and families in our community. APPENDIX E-3 MHSA WET: CSU EAST BAY REPORT828 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG 4 Cohort 1: 2019 -2020 The program began with a cohort of fifteen (15) students, fourteen (14) of whom were subsidized by Mental Health Services Act Workforce, Education & Training (MHSA WET) funds and one paid out of pocket. Of the 15 students, 11 were clinicians of color, 10 spoke one of Alameda County's identified threshold languages, and all 15) worked in Alameda County early childhood community -based organizations (CBOs). Fourteen (14) of the 15 students completed the program in December 2020. Year two (2020) presented ne w challenges resulting from COVID -19. COVID -19 required the development of new teaching methods to address safety concerns. In response, some changes occurred including: Class instruction was moved online (i.e., CSUEB Zoom ) which ensured ongoing instruction. Administratively, ACBH staff creat ed a TEAMS administrative page to track requisite student information , grading and reporting. ACBH had a leadership transiton from retiring Margie Padilla, Director of Early Childhoo d Program, who helped develop the program, to Dr. Clyde Lewis, EPSTD Coordinator with support from Marthea Alley -Caliz, Program Specialist. ACBH worked with CSUEB to develop a plan for and promote student recruitment for Cohort 2. Cohort 2: 2021 -2022 Jointly , ACBH and CSUEB hosted a c ompetitive application process (in Fall 2020) and recruited 15 students (from 19 applicants) for Cohort 2. Recruitment announcements ellicited individuals who focus on early childhood skill development as well as exhibit cultural competencies that can meet the unique needs of the diverse Alameda County child and family populations. Recruitment outreach extended to the Alameda County network of service provider agencies, to networks of CSUEB staff, and to employees and in terns at current clinic and outpatient service sites. The range of interest from CBO employees increased ; and as such, there is a wider range of organizations represented in the second cohort. Given the continued COVID pandemic in 2021 , a number of factors had to be addressed including : Recruitment, typically done in person , moved to online outreach and a remote selection process by reviewing transcripts and essays. Class instruction was adapted to online methods of teaching and learning. The instructor was creative and used different methods to promote engagement. For example, incorporating regular small group activities through the online platform s which allowed interactive problem -solving, sharing of new concepts, and overall connection amongst cohort participants. Administrative tracking tools helped to track class attendance and group engagement activities. An online course evaluation tool, Surv ey Monkey, was utilized to collect feedback and APPENDIX E-3 MHSA WET: CSU EAST BAY REPORT829 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG 5 allow for more accuracy and a higher response rate. In Fall 2022, when some health restrictions had been lifted, i n-person learning resumed for some classes for a hybrid online and in -person model . This allowed for the group to share, explore and connect with other practitioners in the early childhood community. FY 2 1/22 Outcomes, Impacts and Challenges Program Evaluation The program was evaluated by a unique survey developed by UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland in the first year of the pilot . In the second year of the cohort, t he corresponding evaluation survey was administered by UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital, Oakland evaluator, Dr. Laura Frame, and in years three and four it wa s administered by ACBH staff. The evaluation focused on methodological approaches used for student training. To this end, the evaluation provid es ongoing feedback for managers to ensure continuous quality improvement. Evaluation methods used to assess the program include : a training evaluation (online student satisfaction survey); the Learning Curve Survey in year one (to assess student measurement of knowledge, skills, and integration/application of core concepts), and reflective writing assess ments. Student Evaluation Metrics From FY 20/21 and Spring 2022 evaluation data, s tudent evaluations show overall agreement that the stated learning objectives were met and that instructors were responsive, promoted the ethical and clinically sound treatment of clients. Students felt the content was both current and accurate and that th ey understood the value of the program. Students agreed that they \"...learned something useful from this program that I can put into practice in my work\". Further, most students showed high ratings of the instructors demonstrated knowledge/qualifications and clarity of content presentation. While responses showed an overall agreement that objectives were met, there was a range of responses in several areas including entering student educational experience, instructional delivery method, technology use, prog ram administration, and the physical environment. ACBH and CSUEB management worked together to refine learning objectives and improve technology usage. Student Feedback Student feedback from the second -year evaluation helped to inform the second cohort. Several students commented on the value of increased understanding of developmental concepts such as child bids for connection and exploration as part of attachment behavior; strengthened observational skills, assessment tools, and case formulation skills , the value of reflective supervision/consultation, and application of relational models to early childhood mental health. APPENDIX E-3 MHSA WET: CSU EAST BAY REPORT830 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG 6 Instructor Feedback During the second cohort, the instructor, Dr. Valerie Bellas shared feedback on the program. Overall she expressed that several areas of the program have worked well including , collaboration, the pedagogy, the transition to online and subsequent hybrid learning, and the experience of the cohort learning model . She states that \"students have acquired a foundation [in] IECMH [Infant Early Childhood Mental Health] theory and prac tice approach, including development in relationships, reflective practice, cultural humility, and trauma.\" She further states that she believes \"The county and university partnership is a model that can be disseminated and replicated as a model for IEMC H workforce development and training.\" Instructor Responses - December 2021 Q. What components of the first CSUEB Early Childhood Program worked well and any special highlights? Recruitment: This was a success. Cohort 2 [was recruited in the Fall of 2020 and] is such an active, thoughtful, and diverse group! Students share their perspectives, listen to each other, and bring rich professional, personal, and cultural experiences to our learning. We were able to recruit a full class with variability and commonali ties. Students identify as 2 AAPI, 2 Black, 8 Latinx, 3 White, with bi -cultural representation in the group as well, and vary in age and number of years in the field. We recruited a group of students who are primarily mental health direct service providers , which was a focus of our recruitment. One participant noted, \"I have always known that the relationship between caregiver and child is important, but I think I have a deeper understanding of what that means now.\" Another student commented that as a result of the program \"I will be more thoughtful of cultural impacts on children's and families functioning and consider more ways to integrate cultural factors in treatm ent planning and services so that they are as relevant and respectful to each family as possible\" . These responses example both the want and need for programs that address not only field - specific knowledge but an awareness of the needs specific to the pe ople for which graduates will support. APPENDIX E-3 MHSA EAST BAY REPORT831 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG 7 Collaboration: We have built a strong collaboration with CSUEB and ACBHS with regular contact and communication. I have appreciated how we work together and have developed common language and partnered in roles. In addition, we have established longitudinal connections with local agencies many of whom have supported their staff to engage in the IECMH program for this second cohort after hearing good things from their staff who participated in the first cohort. I am so pleased that we have built a reputation in the community as a high quality, engaging, and useful program. Pedagogy : This was a fantastic learning year! We engaged in a variety of learning activities, including lecture, large and small group discussion, written assignments, and readings. We achieved all of this as we transitioned to telelearning model during the pandemic. Across this first year, students have acquired a foundation IECMH theory and practice approach, including development in relationships , reflective practice, cultural humility, and trauma and resilience. Development in relationships: We have covered core content, such as development prenatal to five and attachment. Students have built skills in observation and application of developmental principles to understanding young children's relationships, needs, and strengths in the context o f their families, communities, and systems of care. Reflective Practice: Students engaged in personal self -reflection and shared with each other cultural and family experiences as they relate to IECMH work. We have explored how to approach the work with families through a lens of family -driven care. The group is creating relationships with each other to serve as collegial support to sustain a diverse workforce. Cultural Humility: We have centered health equity and social justice, including the impact of r acism, xenophobia, and the COVID -19 pandemic. We have actively identified inequities in models of service delivery and awareness of our social location and the intersectionalies of identities across relationships. We have benefitted from our guest speakers ' contributions, including parents who have generously shared their experiences with systems of care. Trauma and Resilience : We have come together to understand the impact of trauma on young children and their primary relationships from multiple angles. W e have actively engaged in identifying protective factors in children, families, communities, and how our services and systems can uphold these core protective functions. We have highlighted the importance of self -care to mitigate the impact vicarious trau ma on the IECMH workforce. Q: Please include things you deemed important that were both planned and organic. What was important to me was to balance core content and its application to a dynamic and developing field, alongside personal and group proces s centering the perspectives and experiences of a diverse workforce to develop a reflective and inclusive approach to IECMH service provision for children, families, and communities. APPENDIX E-3 MHSA WET: CSU EAST BAY REPORT832 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG 8 What spontaneously has arisen is the rich diversity of perspectives and experiences of our workforce and the students' clear passion and commitment to learn about, engage in, and re-envision the IECMH field and to develop their practice with children, families, communities and the systems of care within which they work. Q. W hat components of the first CSUEB Early Childhood Program could be improved? Recruitment: The program could benefit from a larger pool of applicants. Although the class was fully enrolled, there were few applicants above the enrollment cutoff. Increas ed applications will help to form a group that is both cohesive and diverse for our next cohort. Early consideration of recruitment approaches may be beneficial for our next cohort. Collaboration: We engaged in strong collaboration, but I believe our pro cess would have benefited from representation by dedicated early childhood coordinator/director at the county. My understanding is that this position has remained unfilled after a staff retirement left a vacancy. In our first cohort, the former early child hood director had a central role in coordination and direction with a focus on early childhood mental health needs. Ongoing, this role could serve to increase collaborative and sustained relationships with community agencies who employ and supervise the IE CMH workforce. Additionally, the first cohort had access to an outside evaluator. Re -engaging a collaboration with an outside evaluator would benefit the program, both to keep track of how the students continue to engage in service delivery and apply thei r learning across time, as well as to more systematically assess the effectiveness of the program, build its sustainability, and support the dissemination of the model. Pedagogy: Despite its overall success, there are areas that could be improved. It is a lways a challenge to find the right balance of foundational content, reflective process, and applied learning. This is an ongoing focus of curriculum development. The group is working toward continuing to find ways to address racism and other forms of sy stemic oppression and the dynamics power and privilege in our interactions and practice. This is an unfolding process across relationships and within our communities and will be a continued explicit focus of the program, utilizing identified tools, approa ches, and centering lived -experience and perspectives of BIPOC and other targeted identities and communities. The amount and type of reading for the class did not always fit with the busy lives of students who are working full -time as they complete this pr ogram. I am working to tailor the readings to these needs, by identifying accessible, targeted, and useful readings and resources. The cumulative impact of the pandemic has increased challenges for students to participate and engage in the program. Support ing students as they navigate personal and professional challenges and provide services during the pandemic is of the utmost importance, including increased opportunities to connect with each other and access to available community resources. APPENDIX E-3 MHSA WET: CSU EAST BAY REPORT833 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG 9 Q. Any other comments or feedback you would like added to the annual report? I believe that the IECMH program is state of the art. The county and university partnership is a model that can be disseminated and replicated as a model for IEMCH workforce development and training. The program is an invaluable resource in building a diverse IECMH specialty workforce in Alameda County and centralizing training in the crucial area of Early Relational Health. The program offers a foundation for IECMH work, as it centers service providers' perspectives and diversity of experience to increase workforce capacity and retention. These elements are key to building an informed, culturally responsive, ethical, and effective approach to s ervice delivery for the children and families we serve. Student Survey Feedback Student surveys were issued and collected at the end of each semester. Of Cohort 2 students completing post -semester surveys, data showed : There was a range of experienced practioners represented including LCSWs, ASWs, and LMFTs with active licenses. Key areas in which students strongly agreed or agreed with included feeling that this course ...: o Trained me to be equipped with the skills necessary to demonstrate knowledge of the transactional nature of development and the centrality of relationships in early childhood using 1 -2 frameworks (e.g., development of attachment, secure -base/safe - haven behaviors, reflective practice.) o Trained me t o describe the role of environmental stressors , including trauma, in a developmental context using 1 -2 related concepts (e.g., the role of early memory, ghosts and angels in the nursery, the impact of racism, xenophobia, and COVID -19 pandemic.) o Trained me to identify the philosophy and key elements of family -driven care across content and processes using 1 -2 approaches to IECMH (e.g., centering fatherhood, cultural humility), and had an instructor(s) [who] demonstrated knowledge, promoted clinically sound a nd ethical treatment of client/customers, and was responsive to participants. APPENDIX E-3 MHSA WET: EAST BAY REPORT834 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG 10 December 2021 Students Feedback Additional student feedback collected from the survey can be found at the end of this report. Overall, students, the instructor, administrators, and community stakeholders shared that they felt that students benefitted greatly from the program and that this resource will continue to strengthen quality services offered by their providers. ACBH and CSUEB have discussed the sustainab ility of the program beyond this pilot ending in December 2022 . Various ideas are being explored including shortening the program from two years to 12 or 18 months or two separate one year courses ( 1st year theory and 2nd year practice to be enrolled in separately) and incorporating early childhood curriculum, and exposure into other social service and educational topics to expose more students to the early childhood field, which is still in need of culturally astute practitioners who reflect the communit ies served. ACBH and CSUEB thanks the MHSA program for sponsoring this pilot. WET funds have supported these efforts as well as the complimentary evaluation services. The learning by the students and administrators will continue to inform direct and pl anned services to youth and families in our community.

Angela James As a (now certified) Family Peer Support Specialist, what respite support is offered to Peer Provider Professionals due to career known high levels of burn -out, compassion fatigue, secondary trauma, low wages, disrespect within organizations and among colleagues, and the use of our life experience as a critical tool in our professional work among clients? Sick days and vacation time cannot be considered as respite as a Peer Provider, especially in the Family sector due to the role and position, as many Peers are caring for those identified in their life experience. Is there room to structure an amount to Family Peer Providers for respite and wellness to preserve the industry for long term personnel? Thank you ACBH/MHSA Response: Thank you for your comment . As indicated in the Summary of Changes section of the FY 2023- 2026 MHSA Three -Year Plan (Draft), MHSA intends to provide workforce engagement and Infrastructure and Service Planning for Peer Support Specialist Certification (SB803) Behavioral Health Continuum Infrastructure Program (BHCIP) projects. ACBH currently utilizes MHSA funds for La Familia 's Sally's Place Peer Respi te. This organization serves residents of Alameda County experiencing mental health distress in a homelike setting for up to 14 days with 24/7 peer support services, access to clinical services and wellness and recovery activities. These services are ava ilable to anyone in Alameda County in need of mental health respite, including Peer and Family Peer Support Specialists. 3/31/23 2. James Moyer This looks to be a very complete and innovative plan which I hope can be implemented, although I remain skeptical. Decades of experience working with adults impacted by mental illness has made me all too aware of how poorly the system, not just in Alameda County but throughout the USA, serves those who most need help. Currently it seems to me our society as a whole is suffering due to a lack of treatment services, especially for those unable to care for themselves. When I began my career as a psychotherapist there were a lot of psych beds available, most of which have now disappeared. There is literally nowhe re to go for most of the severely mentally ill people who wander our streets. Throughout my career I repeatedly saw how the system failed those who it supposedly existed to serve. All too often it seems as if the mental health system is designed more to se rve the needs of the people who run it than it is to meet the needs of the people who really need it. I suppose I am a bit bitter in having watched a truly innovative, community based program (Berkeley Creative Living Center) that also trained new psychoth erapists to work with severe mental illness as it gave something like 100 suffering individuals a place where they were accepted for who they were drastically changed by administrative fiats handed down by people who seemed to have no conception of what CL C was. After 26 years I left rather than participate in further destruction of the program's uniqueness. I see that many of the Wellness Centers are having difficulty retaining staff. They might want to glance back at the old Creative Living Center model f or some insight into what kept me at Berkeley CLC for so long. ACBH/MHSA Response: Thank you for your public comment. As indicated in the Summary of Changes section of the latest MHSA Three -Year Plan (Draft), MHSA will expand medical respite services . Additionally, it will provide funding to plan and implement multiple ACBH Forensic Plan Programs, including the expansion of a satellite urgent care clinic with expanded hours, overnight mobile crisis services, overnight crisis support services, and additional outpatient mental health services. These plans are based off recommendations that community stakeholders identified during various community input meetings in the past several Community Program Planning Processes (CPPP). 4/5/23 3.

Larene Pare Mental and Behavioral health services should be simple and easy to access. In Alameda County, this is not the case. There are many barriers to access therapy that I'm sure you're already aware of. Have programs easily and readily available to the various p opulations in our counties. Providers should also be available to serve all populations (more Black service providers, providers to serve people with developmental disabilities who may be in wheelchairs and are non -verbal, and teens.) I would like to see a wide array of services for our population such as peer led groups, and other community support groups in addition to 1:1 therapy, family and dyadic therapy. I know that in theory these services are supposed to already exist, but the reality is that there are very few providers available and those that may be available have very long wait lists and are not accepting new patients. Please use the resources to hire, train and pay adequate wages so that we can have more providers in the pipeline to support our communities instead of marketing and promoting mental health services that are not readily available. Thank you. ACBH/MHSA Response: Thank you for your public comment. ACBH acknowledges the challenges regarding fully staffing the behavioral health workforce within community -run organizations and in county departments. To help manage th ese obstacles , ACBH currently utilizes MHSA funds for Workforce Development programs in order to help increase the number of behavioral health staff to work in Alameda County. ACBH has also created a one-time ( 1x) capacity building grant project that ACBH providers can apply and receive funding to assist with workforce hiring and retention , information n this project can be found on pg. 17. 4/10/23 5. Alison Munroe (4/10/23 MHAB meeting ) This is an extremely frustrating, cumbersome process. It's been very alienating that the system is supposed to deal with SMI, but instead is dealing with everything instead of addressing hospitalization and medication. It's on the wrong track, and furthermore I don't know if the governor's reform is on the right track. A lot of people say there are few places that Level 1 and 2 are more like anecdotally, people working at FSPs are overburdened and burnt out at least some people at FSPs are burnt out because they can't help the very sickest . The housing bond is so totally up in the air, could be 99% hotel rooms for all we know. Some of it oug ht to go for hospital beds! We have been asked to comment in writing...yes, that's a criticism of MHSA \u2014that it was intended for serious mental illness, not \"wellness.\" What might help teens and young adults in their first bouts of schizophrenia: ways to kee p them from self -medicating with drugs and disappearing onto the street. For a few, there is no substitute for locked facilities. These late teens with early schizophrenia have anosognosia, so they don't understand what's going on, and it may take parents a couple years to understand what schizophrenia is, that it's not just crisis or a behavior, that it's often permanent, that it can be helped by meds and hospitalization sometimes \u2014could be a slow educational process. John George and Villa helped educate parents in the ACBH/MHSA Response: Thank you for your public comment. ACBH continues to develop programs and services for the most severely mentally ill . Such programs includ e full service partnerships, crisis stabilization, crisis residential and peer re spite services. Because the California Code of Regulations, Section 3620 states that \"[l]ong-term hospital and/or long -term institutional care cannot be paid for with MHSA funds,\" additional work and funding for hospital services would need to occur with funding other than MHSA funds , such as the Behavioral Health Continuum Infrastructure program (BHCIP) . 6.

ACBH/MHSA Response: Thank you for your public comment. 04/18/23 8. Barbra Silver I want to express my gratitude to the County 's flexible use of MHSA funds for one -time funding for FY 23 -24 to address workforce issues and CalAIM implementation impacts. Given there is a large short term increase in funding for MHSA anticipated, I strongly encourage the County to continue this inves tment for another year. We are still facing challenges recruiting staff and these types of flexible funding strategies can make a big difference to meet community needs. I am also concerned about the planned ballot measure that might divert large parts of MHSA funding towards housing. Although there is a great need for more housing, if we take away our investments in prevention and early intervention and innovation projects the long term impacts could be creating more problems down the road. I hope we unite as a community to sustain these important services ACBH/MHSA Response: Thank you for your public comment. More information will be publicized on the planned ballot measure once the finalized language of the measure has been released to the public. Additionally, b ased on Public Comment and analysis of community input, ACBH Leadership has decided to implemen t another round of 1x capacity building funds. These funds will be directed towards workforce retention and CalAIM preparedness. More information will be published once the process is ready for implementation. 04/18/23 9.

Josh Thurman The Tri -Valley faces many geographic challenges when it comes to providing mental heath and Substance Use Disorder (SUD) services to our residents. Many of the Mental Health and SUD services are located in Mid and North County, which makes it extremely dif ficult for our residents. In 2021 the Alameda County Behavioral Health Department conducted an East County Needs Assessment (Substance Use Disorder Services) indicate there is enough need within the Tri -Valley's Medi -Cal population to support stand alone s ervices in the Tri -Valley. The City of Livermore is working with La Familia and BHCS staff to secure an inpatient service location and also supporting La Familia's BCHIP grant application, however if we are unsuccessful we will need an alternative plan to serve the Tri -Valley. While we find the IHOT program to be a successful model, it has its limitations in the Tri - Valley. Many times when providers or Homeless Liaison Officers make IHOT referrals it can take weeks to get a response or a coordinated effort from several providers to make multiple referrals for the same individual. We recognize that it's been challenging for non - profits to hire and maintain staffing levels, however the Tri -Valley would like BHCS to do an analysis of the number of IHOT referra ls coming from the Tri -Valley and consider having IHOT staff located in the Tri -Valley, which would decrease the response time and better serve those in crisis. With the growing number of 5150 calls law enforcement is receiving, having a Mobile Evaluation Team (MET) located in the Tri -Valley would allow for additional comprehensive and compassionate services for the Tri -Valley's most vulnerable populations, including community members experiencing homelessness or mental illness. We would like to explore po ssible opportunities to bring this service to the Tri -Valley. Thank you for all the great work you do and we look forward to continuing to work with your staff. ACBH/MHSA Response: Thank you for your public comment and continued partnership . The ACBH Crisis Division plans to deploy the Community Assessment Treatment Team (CATT) from Livermore in the new fiscal year , possibly as early as July 2023. Th is team will focus on the Tri -Valley area. As the MET team is comprised of a patrol officer and a clinician 's successful implementation and piloting of this program re quires partnering with a local law enforcement agency . When ACBH last spoke with the Livermore Police Department in 2022, they stated that they were not interested in partnering with us to pilot this program. Additionally, the Pleasanton PD is piloting a team (MET model) in Pleasanton with the CBO Bonita House and their clinicians. The pilot began Dec of 2022. 04/26/23 11. Kristin Spanos Dear Dr. Karyn L. Tribble, Thank you for the opportunity to comment on Alameda County's Mental Health Services Act (MHSA) three -year plan for FY 2022 -23. First 5 Alameda County applauds the County for its efforts to support the mental healt h and well -being of our residents through cultural and community centered strategies. We are encouraged by the county's priority efforts to expand early childhood mental health projects, advance cultural and community centered strategies, and increase prog rams that provide supportive housing and crisis stabilization programming. Alameda County has the opportunity to build on the existing work to promote culturally relevant, trauma -informed services and systems to 4/27/23 842 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Page 5 of 23 address infant and early childhood mental he alth needs[1]. We are writing to highlight the continued need for mental health services and supports that target young children, their parents/caregivers, and the early care and education workforce. First 5 is guided by a \"whole community, whole family, whole child\" policy and programming approach that seeks to ensure that all children in Alameda County are ready for kindergarten by creating the conditions that position all for success. Longitudinal studies show that overall kindergarten readiness is linked to third grade outcomes and later success over the life course. Findings from our 2021- 22 Kindergarten Readiness Assessment , a participatory research project that surveyed over 3000 parents/caregivers, early care and education professionals (ECE), and TK and Kindergarten teachers in Alameda County, show that child and f amily health and well -being are key predictors of kindergarten readiness. Our most recent report found that 33% of parents believe their child is fully ready for kindergarten compared to 44% in 2019 . Additional data from our most recent study includes: Children who attended well -child visits had higher readiness. In addition, children whose parents/caregivers reported fewer concerns about their child's mental health also had higher readiness . Among children with special needs, 28 percent were unable to a ccess the professional help they needed during the pandemic. The percent of parents/caregivers reporting high stress levels increased 13 points during COVID -19. Past research in Alameda County found lower levels of parenting stress were linked to higher re adiness. ECE professionals, and TK and Kindergarten teachers have identified the need for more mental health and well -being supports for themselves and their students. Educators with high levels of stress were more than four times more likely to say they p lan to leave the profession . To support the mental health and well -being of our young children, parents/caregiver, and ECE workforce, Alameda County can partner with us in advancing the following recommendations from our 2021 -22 KRA study. Support Thriving Communities Increase identification of and support for children with special needs, including early screening and intervention services through pediatric visits and community. Support strategies and programs that improve timely access to community supports through family navigation and care coordination. Support Family Health & Well -being Improve systems to expand access to affordable, culturally responsive mental health services and supports for families and children within the community. Invest in programs, services, and policies that are affirming and responsive to the cultural and language needs of communities to address historical inequities and mitigate current experiences of discrimination.

Invest in parent/caregiver peer groups, including those that are culturally and gender specific (e.g., dad's groups, Afro -play, LGBTQ+), support networks, community building, and opportunities for leadership . Improve systems to expand access by eliminating barriers like long applications, frequent renewals, and Medi -Cal premiums and co- payments. Support Educators & Systems Increase access to affordable, quality mental health and self -care resources for ECE professionals, educators, and classroom -based supports for children. Support communication, collaboration, and partnerships between the home, informal care settings, early care and education professionals, community programs, and schools. Support policies a nd practices that expand family navigation and care coordination services at ECE settings and schools. We hope that with this information, the County considers additional mental health investments that specifically support children ages 0 to 5, their families/caregivers, and the ECE workforce. We are available to serve as a thought partner -- please don't he sitate to reach out with any questions. Sincerely, Kristin Kristin Spanos Chief Executive Officer Pronouns (she, her, hers) First 5 Alameda County 1115 Atlantic Ave Alameda, CA 94501 ACBH/MHSA Response: Thank you for your public comment. This inform ation and request will be routed to our ACBH Leadership Team, including our Child and Young Adult System of Care Director for information and continued partnership. ACBH appreciates the information and understands the continued need of young children. ACB H will be implementing a new early childhood mental health consultation program through an official upcoming procurement process as listed in the \"Changes \" section of the MHSA Draft Plan. 12. Thu Quach As a member of the Mental Health Advisory Board, I have reviewed the plan and have the following comments I. General Comments: This is a very long and overwhelmingly detailed report, but I find it is not necessarily very accessible. It is difficult to review 835 pages to get the different information. Given that this is such a long report, the Executive Summary can be better in highlighting key areas and articulating the key points, such as how the stakeholder process informed and changed the priorities put forth. Otherwise, it feels like there was a lot of input gathered but not sure how these were incorporated into the plan. It is not clear the metrics used to evaluate how ACBH has been doing and how they will be evaluated on meeting the goals set forth. If it is in there, it is not easy to find. 04/28/23 APPENDIX F-1: MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE PUBLIC COMMENTS844 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Page 7 of 23 II. Stakeholder input - how were input incorporated into the overall plan The plan provides the specifics of the different stakeholder engagement, but it isn't entirely clear in what way the input changed or affirmed the priorities of the plan. Page 3 mentions the alignment, communication and organizational structure, but it i s unclear how these areas respond to the themes raised from the CPPP. It may be buried in the sections, but the executive summary should provide a better write up, if there are any responses. It is difficult looking through the daunting 800+ pages of the r eport. The detailed narrative lists out the findings and recommendations, but only then lists out current funded programs. That does not seem like sufficient information to respond to the recommendations. Even if such programs are funded, are they suffi cient to meet the needs, are they effective (e.g., what metrics are being used). This also does not seem to reflect incorporating/ responding to issues raised. MHSA Community Investment Opportunity It would be good to provide the rationale on why $80 ,000 per entity was selected and how many entities are expected to be funded, given the intention to commit $10M. This is a lot of funds that are spread out so thinly, so it is unclear how this is intended to help boost the CBOs to address the five eligibl e funding areas. III. Cultural Competence While cultural competence and responsiveness was listed as a guiding principle, the Plan does not highlight how ACBH is emphasizing this. There is only a section on Asian Americans & Pacific Islanders (AAPI) Older Adult pilot in Fremont. Given the divers ity of AAPI community and the language needs, I don't know if it is sufficient to hire two bilingual FTE. Are there other systems changes that the county is undertaking to address the growing AAPI population as well as their cultural and linguistic needs. The County, beyond Fremont, is comprised of 32.1% AAPI, with an estimated 20% being limited English proficient. Some ethnic groups have as high as 50% (e.g., Vietnamese, Cambodian, etc...). Threshold languages include Vietnamese, Arabic and Tagalog (beyond C antonese and Mandarin) - page 37. Are there any efforts to ensure these languages are provided in the different cities in the County. On page 64, I find it troublesome that we had only 1 respondent who took the survey in Chinese and 4 in Spanish. While there seems to be a decent racial/ethnic diversity, it would appear that there wasn't much participation from those who are limited English proficient (LEP). Do we know if this LEP population was represented (e.g., they had assistance from others to respon d to survey in English). Given the large LEP population, it is important that their voice and concerns are incorporated, including doing more targeted recruitment. IV. Workforce, Education, and Training (WET) It would be good to know what ACBH will do aft er the needs assessment is conducted. It does not seem sufficient to just include that a needs assessment will be done. How will the needs assessment inform priorities? Will there be any commitments to address some of the priority needs? Will the findings be shared out to the public? While this section only focuses on changes from the previous plan, it would be good to share how the proposed psychiatry training partnership are add -ons to the existing training programs. It would be good to list out what ar e the current ones, to show how ACBH is investing in the different roles within a robust mental health team (e.g., licensed mental health professionals, peer counselors, case managers, psychiatrist). Are there any efforts to address the severe mental he alth workforce shortages, including providing seed funding for CBOs to grow their own pipeline programs? Are there any emphasis on bilingual/ bicultural professionals, given ACBH's commitment to cultural competency and responsiveness? ACBH/MHSA Response: Thank you for your public comment. Your comments will be shared with ACBH Leadership for future and ongoing discussions regarding programming, budget and the direction of the MHSA going forward. APPENDIX F-1: MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE PUBLIC COMMENTS845 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Page 8 of 23 Please see our responses to several of your abov e comments: 1) ACBH recognizes the MHSA Three -Year draft Plan is lengthy, however this document serves not only as a tool for information sharing regarding MHSA programming, but also as a regulatory and audit tool to provide evidence to the Department of Health Care Services that Alameda is meeting its regulatory requirements. While MHSA is a very flexible funding stream, compared to other revenue sources, it is highly regulated . For example, the PEI portion of MHSA regulations that a county must adhere to is 27 pages long. To make the Plan more accessible and understandable , ACBH will make efforts , to expand the Executive Summary, as well as the public comment period , in future iterat ions of this document . 3) In collaboration with the ACBH Data Team , the MHSA Division will work to create public - facing dashboards and data visualization s. These tools will enable us to clearly describe the communities we serve and the services that they receive. 4) The MHSA team will showcase additional program outcomes and metrics for MHSA funded programs in the next MHSA Annual Update. Each ACBH contract contains both process and outcome measures and is overseen by a program and fiscal contract m onitor , as well as a System of Care operational staff member . In the most recent triennial MHSA program review by the Department of Health Care Services , the contracts and oversight for MHSA funded services were highlighted as being a significant strength of the department. 5) Regarding the MHSA Community Investment Opportunity , the $80,000 per entity amount was selected based on the idea of offering this funding to all 125 ACBH contracted providers (125 providers x 80,000=$10M). The majority of the $10M that was available for this project was identified from the WET and CFTN components \u2014both of which do not have their ow n funding allowance. WET/CFTN and the Prudent Reserve (PR) are funded by transferring funds from the CSS component. The amount a county can transfer from CSS to WET/CFTN/PR is based on the following formula: For each fiscal year, a County may only transf er into its P R, CFTN Account, WET Account, or any combination of the three, up to twenty (20) percent of the average amount of the total funds a county receives, over the previous five (5) fiscal years. So, as an example, for FY 23/24, using the above formula , Alameda County was able to transfer $17M from CSS, of which $7M was allocated to ongoing WET/CFTN projects and $10M to the 1x MHSA Community Investment Opportunity. The majority of the $10M was allocated to CBO providers. Based on Publi c Comment and analysis of community input , ACBH Leadership has decided to implement another round of 1x capacity building funds. These funds will be directed towards workforce retention and Cal AIM preparedness. More information will be published once the process is ready for implementation. 6) The MHSA Team agrees with the comments above regarding the LEP community and looks forward to partnering more with providers and the MHAB to plan LEP community engagement, Regarding other systems changes that the county is undertaking to address the growing AAPI population as well as their cultural and linguistic needs , the Health Equity Division has started a n internal workgroup to develop out a workplan to start engaging the AAPI communities . This outreach is to develop ideas , supports , and services to increase engagement and utilization of ACBH services. The goal of this small workgroup to be able to implem ent a AAPI advisory group similar in nature to the African American Health and Wellness Steering Committe e. The Office of the Medical Director is also in the nascent stages of developing an AAPI Patients A dvisory Board at the Federally Qualified Health Center, Bay Area Community Health. APPENDIX F-1: MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE PUBLIC COMMENTS846 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Page 9 of 23 7) The ACBH Workforce, Education and Training Division (WET) is currently in the initial planning stages of the next ACBH Workforce Needs Assessment. Information regarding the regulatory requirements for the needs assessment can be found in the Mental Health Services Act. 6. California Code of Regulations, Title 9, Section 3830 . Per the regulation , the purpose of the process is to \"...conduct an assessment of the education and training needs of its Public Mental Health System workforce and prepare a written Workforce Needs Assessment that identifies and evaluates the identified needs. The County shall conduct the Workforce Needs Assessment at least once every five years \". Upon completion of this an alysis , the document will then be published on the ACBH and MHSA website. This document will also include recommendations and next steps to improve the behavioral health workforce and capacity of the public mental health system. 8) ACBH welcomes comments and ideas to increase the beh avioral health workforce pipeline for Alameda County. Currently, for WET programs \u2014 such as the graduate intern stipend program and the loan assumption program \u2014ACBH prioritizes individuals who identify as one or more of the following: bilingual/bicultural communities of color, LGBTQI , and/or have lived experience with mental illness. 13. Juliet Leftwich\u0005 1. The Mental Health Advisory Board (MHAB) was not given adequate time to provide meaningful feedback within the public comment period. The MHSA plan should have been made public prior to April 1, so that the MHAB could hear the MHSA presentation, ask questio ns and provide written feedback as a board by April 30. 2. The MHSA plan is over 700 pages, which is far too lengthy and cumbersome for the public to review and digest, especially in such a short period of time. If the plan cannot be significantly shorte ned, it should, at a minimum, include an in -depth Executive Summary which covers all of the plan's most significant points. The Executive Summary is only 4 pages long. 3. The last sentence of the first paragraph on p. 706, describing the CF2 Respite Bed Expansion, states that \"These beds were created to meet a need that doesn't exist.\" Presumably that's a typographical error. 4. The plan should provide funding for the expansion of the Safe Landing Project at Santa Rita Jail so that it: 1) can be located in a permanent structure, rather than in a trailer; and 2) have a presence within the jail, so inmates can be connected to Pro ject services prior to the time they exit providing services for the those who are seriously mentally ill, the population intended to be served by the enactment of the Mental Health Services Act. 6. California Code of Regulations, Title 9, Section 3400(b)( 2) states that programs and/or services provided with MHSA funds shall \"Be designed for voluntary participation. No person shall be denied access based solely on his/her voluntary or involuntary status.\" How has that provision been interpreted? The languag e is not, on &QYMTZLM\u0005JFHM\u0005TK\u0005YMJ\u0005UWTLWFRX\u0005RF^\u0005GJ\u0005\\TWYM\\MNQJ\u0011\u0005RFS^\u0005FWJ\u0005STY\u0005KTHZXJI\u0005TS\u0005 \u0005 \u0005 ACBH/MHSA Response: Thank you for your public comment. Your comments will be shared with ACBH Leadership for future and ongoing discussions regarding programming, budget ing, and the direction of the MHSA going forward under the Governor's proposal. Please see our responses to several of your above comments: 1) While ACBH recognizes the MHSA Three -Year draft Plan is lengthy, we also understand that this document serves multiple purposes with respect to our work. First , it is a tool for information sharing regarding MHSA programming . Additionally, this document is a regulatory and audit tool to provide evidence to the Department of Health Care Services that Alameda is meeting its regulatory requirements. While MHSA is a very flexible funding stream, compared to other revenue sources, it is highly regulated . For example, the PEI 04/29/23 APPENDIX F-1: MHSA UPDATE PUBLIC COMMENTS847 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Page 10 of 23 portion of MHSA regulations that a county must adhere to is 27 pages long. Going forward, ACBH will make efforts to expand the Executive Summary, as well as the public comment period, in order to make community input more accessible to the pu blic. 2) ACBH agrees that The Mental Health Services Act. 6. California Code of Regulations, Title 9, Section 3400(b)(2) is not clear. Various California c ounties have interpreted this section of regulations to mean that a MHSA project that serves voluntary participants can also serve involuntary (LPS) participants. But a project set up to only serve involuntary participants can not be funded through MHSA. In the event that an individual receiving services through a MHSA project needs crisis intervention or stabilization Counties will use MHSA funds up to the point that they go into a locked facility. From here, the locked facility placements are then funded through non -MHSA funds. 3) ACBH Leadership is exploring available funding for the Safe Landing project. At this time, MHSA funding has not been identified due to other available funding ; however, future MHSA funding is allowed to assist with discharge planning. Per the Mental Health Services Act. 6. California Code of Regulations, Title 9, Section 3610(g) , \"[t]he County may use MHSA funds for programs/services provided in juvenile halls and/or cou nty jails only for the purpose of facilitating discharge. \" 14. Teresa Land 7. The cites have firsthand in the field experience dealing with the homeless and calls to the police for 5150's. The MHSA Director should seek input from city councils and mayors on what their communities need to meet treatment of mental illness needs. 8. The county should consider doing an assessment to find out how many FSP programs and slots are needed to meet the needs. Are the current 1,045 slots enough? If not, how many are needed? Can funds from other MHSA be applied to meeting this critical need? 9. Nearly every FSP program mention Shortage of housing and staff (clinical case mangers, therapist etc.) to treat those in their programs - could funds be re -directed to meeting these needs? 10.On page 380 the priorities are stated for PEI portfolio shown below. The portfolio should be reviewed and scrubbed to focus investments on programs that address these specific goals and avoid being spread too thin and being ineffective. a. Mental Health Services Oversight & Accountability Commission (MHSOAC) e stablished priorities for the use of County's Prevention and Early Intervention funds\u00b3: b. There are Six focus areas are listed and overarching goal stated: Outcomes: PEI programs focus on reducing seven negative outcomes that may result from untreated men tal illness: suicide, incarceration, school failure or dropout, unemployment, prolonged suffering, homelessness, and removal of children from their homes. c. This provides good guidance on what our county programs and portfolios should focus on in the PEI area. When looking at the ensemble of our portfolio many don't appear to be specifically focused on these desired outcomes. 11.Many of our programs address these desired outcomes and are doing good work in these areas. 12.However, A fair number of pr ograms aspire to serve in very broad areas, many of which appear to be general wellness and community outreach in areas other than MI (art, socials, gardening, drum circles, dance, celebrations, host an interactive wellness retreat which included wellness stations, face painting, writing workshop, Aromatherapy, meditation, food delivery, legal help for immigrants, voting, vaccinations drives, social justice, racial justice, etc.). Would clients in need be better served by more focused programs that address the specific MI PEI goals and desired outcomes stated in the MHSA guidance? 13.For example, the 'wellness centers' and outreach programs described in CSS OESD section seem much more focused on serving MI needs. An example of more focused MI needs while also serving other basic needs: Program Description: Wellness Centers provide a welcoming entry point for outpatient services for individuals who are unserved or underserved by the mental health system. They \u0005provide step -down service for individuals 04/30/23 PUBLIC COMMENTS848 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Page 11 of 23 transi tioning from ACBH specialty mental health services in an environment of inclusion and acceptance in facilities that are commonly managed and staffed by consumers who provide or arrange for peer support. Wellness Centers are contracted providers who perform outreach and engagement; offer outpatient services such as mental health services, case management/brokerage, crisis intervention, medication support/dispensing; provide peer support and wellness services; and Tenant Support Services (TSP) for those with housing insecurity. 14.In a number of programs, there seems to be a disconnect between the program description and examples of successes and accomplishments for the year for quite a few programs in PEI. For example, citing community engagement social ev ents and general wellness activities instead of providing or connecting people to MH services. Are there Metrics and accountability for delivering on MH aspects of the program goals? 15.The following PEI programs are of particular concern in that they l ack focus on serving MI needs and either the program description and/or the accomplishment examples cite general community service rather than MI and MH needs. Concern that focus is on being generally helpful to community but is not focused on preventing S MI or severe outcomes as MHSA focus states. In addition, it is unclear how or if some of these programs connect people to MH services. PEI programs: PEI 7, PEI 8, PEI 17B, PEI 19, PEI 20A, PEI 20B, PEI 20E, PEI 27, PEI 28 16. Concern that quite a few pro grams mention staff fatigue and lack of capacity to execute. 17. CF2 Respite Bed Expansion. This seems like an important project that is focused on previously unmet needs - It seems like funding is ending - are needs currently met? - is more funding stil l needed to meet the needs? 18. CF5: African American Wellness Hub. While there was general support for the concept, there were Serious concerns expressed by MHSA SG: - For a $19 mission investment there should be a well -defined program. The Vision sound ed more like a community center that could refer people to services rather than provide them on site. - Did not focus on the needs of mentally ill. - Lack of clarity on what the 'wellness hub Program' was. - Plans did not include having a psychiatrist and therapist on site, which stakeholders viewed as essential. - could you rent space and refine program to best meet needs before buying a building? A building should not be procured without well -defined needs and programing developed to meet those needs. - It was mentioned that there are community listening sessions planned for April - suggested that the questions posed to the community be focused on mental illness/health treatment needs and not just a blank slate of what is wanted in a 'wellness hub'. - Conc ern raised that the building that is currently being pursued would need extensive renovations including the addition of an elevator. 19. Given the changes to MHSA funding that are proposed by the Governor, the MHAB suggest reconsidering starting any new programs that are not aligned with the proposed changes. 20. Concern that programs may not have clearly defined measurable goals and objectives each year and that there is lack of accountability to demonstrate that they are meeting or making progress towards those goals. Goals should be focused on serving the mentally ill. \u0005 ACBH/MHSA Response: Thank you for your public comment. Your comments will be shared with ACBH Leadership for future and ongoing discussions regarding programming, budget and the direction of the MHSA going forward under the Governor's proposal . Please see our responses to several of your above comments: 1) ACBH is developing a strategic plan for the department which will be shared with the Mental Health Advisory Board and may answer questions and comments regarding unmet APPENDIX F-1: MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE PUBLIC COMMENTS849 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Page 12 of 23 needs in the county. The Workforce Unit will also be conducting a needs assessment in FY 23/24 to better understand the current and specific workforce needs, which wil l provide guidance to ACBH for future investments such as expanded intern programming, graduate stipend programming, loan repayment programming and possible new pipeline projects. 2) The MHSA team appreciates comments regarding other stakeholders to invit e and engage in planning processes. City councils and mayors were informed about the draft Three Year Plan and invited to make public comment . The MHSA team will make additional efforts in this area as new planning and input opportunities arise. 3) The MHSA team will showcase additional program outcomes and metrics for MHSA funded programs in the next MHSA Annual Update , to the extent that it is able to do so. . Each ACBH contract contains both process and outcome measures and are overseen by a program a nd fiscal contract monitor , as well as a System of Care operational staff member . In the most recent triennial MHSA program review conducted by the Department of Health Care Services , the contracts for MHSA funded services were highlighted as being a significant strength of the department. 4) In the next Annual Update , the MHSA team will try to more closely connect PEI programming to the seven negative outcomes of mental illness mentioned in the MHSA , as well as highlight the current evaluation metrics that are being implemented. ACBH has many culturally responsive and affirming programs tha t are positively affecting individuals and their families. In the recent triennial MHSA program review by the Department of Health Care Services Alameda's PEI portfolio was considered a significant strength of the department. 5) Lack of housing and workforce development and retention remain two top issues not only within ACBH but across Alameda County communities and county departments. These two issues will continue to be reviewed and discussed at the ACBH Leadership level. 6) The CF2 Respite Bed Expansion programming will continue, but the use of CFTN funding for the renovation of space will be completed as mentioned in the Plan. Other ongoing funding outside of MHSA will be used to provide the medical respite services; these will be operated by the Office of Homeless Care and Coordination (OHCC) under the Office of the Health Care Services Agency Director. 7) The comments and concerns from the ongoing MHSA Stakeholder Group regarding the African American Wellness Hub were documented in meeting notes that were submitted to the ACBH Health Equity Director. Currently , multiple listening sessions are taking place to determine the community voice and needs for the types of services that will be offered once the building has bee n established. The analysis of the listening sessions will take place this summer , after which summarized information will be shared with the public. 15. Joty Sikand, Courtney Meier, Jessica Martins We are gratified that ACBH has acknowledged and supported the value of Prevention and Early Intervention (PEI) services and we are pleased that it will continue to be funded during the next few years. In light of the possibility that funding may change in the coming years based on actions the State legislature might take, we would like to remind why PEI services are so important to supporting all populations of individuals and even aim to prevent homelessness in a variety of ways. Taking the funding away fr om PEI may help the current homeless population but it will have the detrimental effect of guaranteeing a new homeless population in the future. Prevention is a key component to PEI and an integral part of community behavioral health services. The focus of Prevention is providing at large public health education about mental wellness and signs of symptoms. Having the ability to provide Prevention services in school -based settings allows us to be able to offer various support groups, training and consultat ions to school staff and equipping them to handle the behaviors they experience in their classrooms. This helps prevent the need to refer students out to services unless 04/30/23 APPENDIX F-1: MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE PUBLIC COMMENTS850 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Page 13 of 23 symptoms are apparent and in such cases, early case finding helps connect these studen ts to EI treatment services. The goal of Prevention in these settings is to enable the school staff to do their job effectively while managing student behavior towards adaptive ways to learn and develop positively. Another of PEI's significant impacts is to prevent the escalation of suffering, including either preventing or intervening early to address Serious Mental Illness and supporting the linkage to a higher level of care or additional resources when needed. For example, a student was referred to the Student Attendance Review Board due to excessive missed days at school. A Hume Consultant participating in the meeting as a community based provider subsequently offered EPTSD and other support to the student's family. When connecting with the family and b uilding rapport, the consultant learned about difficulties the family faced such as financial distress and the student's history of trauma that was impacting his motivation and mood. The consultant helped empower the parents to advocate for the student and involved a district social worker to provide additional support (e.g. bus passes, financial aid supports). This helped the student start increasing his attendance and improving academically and socio -emotionally. There are also a number of individuals an d families that we have been able to serve through Early Intervention and that directly prevented homelessness. For example, there was a high school senior who had been receiving Early Intervention services and was preparing to graduate from high school bu t whose caregiver had shared she would need to move out of the home after turning 18. The Early Interventionist was able to work with the student to not only address her social emotional needs around her life transition but also help her identify a plan fo r stable housing in the future. PEI is effective in preventing future homelessness and severe mental health needs. Services aim to support students graduating from high school, gaining healthy coping skills, increasing motivational skills, and linking to additional services/resources to promote well - being of the student's and family. PEI can be the first \"stop\" for individuals to receive support and get connected to services that they may need. We also support them until they are fully connected to therape utic treatment services and help with the linkage and transition. Through Early Intervention services we have also been able to engage the support of case \u0005management resources to address basic needs including housing and food for families who do not have o ther ways of receiving these services. With PEI services on campus we help minimize barriers to accessing services, we provide services to students who do not have access to services. These services are particularly valuable for ethnic minorities and LGBT Q student community who often lack crucial emotional support on campus. Our South Asian Community Health Promotion Services Program is an especially effective example of this, given its focus on services to diverse members of the South Asian community to b ridge gaps in services and educate the community on mental health to help reduce stigma. Reducing or even eliminating the funding for PEI services would have many detrimental effects. Not only would integral outreach and education regarding social emotion al wellness be hindered and services for individuals who already experience barriers connecting to services to address their social emotional needs be limited, but efforts to prevent homelessness would be severely compromised. During the past nine years, t he Hume Center has provided PEI services to 1,600 individuals, more than 20 schools and to three school district administrations in the Tri -Valley. Among the beneficiaries of this assistance have been district social workers, school counselors, teachers, s taff, administrators, directors, students, their caregivers, parents, family elders and other family members. During FY 21 -22, 3,036 unique services were provided to 187 students in 2,402 total service hours. We sincerely hope that ACBH will continue to b e a strong advocate for Prevention and Early Intervention services in our community as reflected in Mental Health Services Act Alameda County FY 2023 -2026 Three Year Program Expenditure Plan. Should there be APPENDIX F-1: MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE PUBLIC COMMENTS851 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Page 14 of 23 any reconsideration of MHSA Funding at the State level that would considerably reduce or even eliminate Prevention and Early Intervention Services, we would be eager to join ACBH in advocating against any such reallocation. ACBH/MHSA Response : Thank you for your public comment. ACBH appreciates its partnership with the Portia Bell Hume Center . 16. Katy Polony We need, beyond all else, more Villa Fairmonts. If this is the least restrictive setting for those in need, then funding by MHSA is allowed. We must provide the necessary treatment for our loved ones/clients \u0005 ACBH/MHSA Response : Thank you for your public comment. Additional work and funding for services like Villa Fairmont may occur with funding other than MHSA funds, such as the Behavioral Health Continuum Infrastructure program (BHCIP). FSP clients may also receive short term inpatient services under MHSA, per California Code of Regulations, Section 3620 : Notwithstanding Section 3400, the County may pay for short -term a cute inpatient services, not to exceed 30 days, for clients in Full Service Partnerships when the client is uninsured and there are no other funds available for this purpose. Long term hospital and/or long -term institutional care cannot be paid for with MH SA funds. \" 04/30/23 17. Dianne Golding More hospital beds are needed. SMI easily fall through the cracks of voluntary treatment. My son was at Santa Rita Jail for 5 years waiting for his Not Guilty By Reason of Insanity and then a transfer to Napa State Hospital. He is FINALLY getting real treatment. If REAL treatment is not given, there is always a jail bed available. So, however you figure out your Plan, make sure, if you intend to help those with SMI to open more beds of all kinds, local and stat e for true treatment. ACBH/MHSA Response : Thank you for your public comment. ACBH continues to develop programs and services for the most severely mentally ill. Additional work and funding for hospital services may occur with other funding than MHSA fun ds, such as the Behavioral Health Continuum Infrastructure program (BHCIP), since the California Code of Regulations, Section 3620 states that \"[l]ong term hospital and/or long -term institutional care cannot be paid for with MHSA funds. \" 04/30/23 18. PAULA AIELLO What the seriously mentally ill have lived without and most need now are new and better secure facilities for treatment, ideally and new and better subacute hospital like Villa Fairmont and a state -of-the-art psychiatric hospital to add to or replace John George. We family members have made this abundantly clear over and over again and, yet, your new planned budget effectively ignores this need. Of the $176 million you plan to spend, you are allocating LESS THAN 1/2 OF ONE PERCENT ($9.9 million) to capita l investments. Why are you so deaf to the needs of the sickest of the sick who were the primary intended beneficiaries of Proposition 63? The voters of California clearly made their voice clear at that time that people with SMI should have priority in re ceiving the funds from the MHSA. As one of those voters, I demand that you reset your priorities and invest in quality and sufficiently abundant psychiatric care in Alameda County. ACBH/MHSA Response : Thank you for your public comment. ACBH continues to develop programs and services for the most severely mentally ill including crisis stabilization, crisis residential and peer respite services. Additional work and funding for hospital services may occu r with funding other than MHSA funds , such as the Behavioral Health Continuum Infrastructure program (BHCIP), per the following section of the California Code of Regulations, Section 3620 : Long term hospital and/or long -term institutional care cannot be paid for with MHSA funds. 04/30/23 APPENDIX F-1: MHSA MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Page 15 of 23 19. Brian Bloom 1. The Mental Health Services Act was intended to provide funding to people suffering from the most serious, disabling and persistent forms of mental illness. (See Welfare & Institutions Code sec. 5600.3(b).) It appears th at many of the programs funded in the Three -Year Plan do not address the needs of the most seriously mentally ill people in our count. 2. State law is clear that the MHSA can fund short -term acute inpatient treatment for clients who are in Full Service P artnerships (FSPs). (See 9 Cal. Code of Reg. 3620(k).) Every year in our county many FSP clients require treatment and stabilization in an acute and/or sub -acute hospital setting. It appears that there is nothing in the Three -Year Plan which funds medic ally necessary treatment in an acute or sub -acute setting for FSP clients. 3. Under California law, PEI is supposed to pay for \"downstream\" RELAPSE prevention for people who already have a severe mental illness. Welfare and Institutions Code section 5840(c) states: \"[The PEI program] shall also include components similar to programs that have been successful in reducing the duration of untreated severe mental illness and assisting people in quickly regaining productive lives.\" I don't see anything in t he PEI funding \"bucket\" of the 3 -year plan that is aimed at preventing relapse and deterioration for people who are already suffering from serious and persistent mental illness. 4. I'm not sure the stakeholder process hears the voices of those who are su ffering the most in our county. People who are in and out of John George and who traverse the endless cycle of John George - Jail - Homeless encampments are not represented in the stakeholder process. 5. Though this is clearly not intentional, allowing for the public to comment on an 800 page draft plan in a 30 day window sends the message that the comments are not going to be taken that seriously and will not meaningfully change the draft document. 6. The MHSA Three -Year Plan should anticipate the new direction coming from Sacramento and include funding specifically targeted to treat \"homeless persons who are mentally ill.\" (See Welfare & Institutions Code sec. 5600.3(b)(4)(A).). This would mean funding permanent supportive housing programs. 7. The Draft Plan makes it clear that for those individuals who are able to engage and participate in an FSP, their chances of being hospitalized and/or arrested in the future is reduced. Clearly FSPs can work for those who engage and are amenable to treatme nt. I didn't see anything in the Draft Plan that funds programs aimed at the population who, by virtue of their mental illness, is not able to engage in a Full Service Partnership. 8. While comprising approximately 10% of the adult population in Alameda County, Blacks comprise half of the jail population and half of those who are \"5150'd.\" I didn't see anything in the Draft Plan which seeks to specifically address this racial disparity and to set the county on a path of reducing this terrible inj ustice. ACBH/MHSA Response : Thank you for your public comment. Your comments will be shared with ACBH Leadership for future and ongoing discussions regarding programming, budget and the direction of the MHSA going forward as it relates to the Governor's Proposal To Modernize The MHSA. Please see our responses to several of your above comments: 1) While ACBH recognizes the MHSA Three -Year Draft Plan is lengthy , we also understand that this document serves not only as a tool for information sharing regarding MHSA programming, but also as a regulatory and audit tool to provide evidence to the Department of Health C are Services that Alameda is meeting its regula tory requirements. Although MHSA is a very flexible funding stream when compared to other revenue sources , it is also highly regulated one., For example , the PEI portion of MHSA regulations that a county must adhere to is 27 pages long ; to thoroughly address the requirements of this 04/30/23 APPENDIX F-1: MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE PUBLIC COMMENTS853 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Page 16 of 23 section requires a robust and thoughtful responses, which often entail l arge response sections. 2) ACBH will make efforts in the future to expand the stakeholder process for better representation of those with a severe mental illness . We will also expand the Executive Summary, as well as the public comment period , to allow for a higher volume of community input. 3) The MHSA Division will collaborate with the ACBH Data Team to build public -facing dashboards and data visualizat ion. These products will highlight the clients served within MHSA programs and tell a clearer story of who is being served and in what capacity. 4) Multiple programs are funded with MHSA to engage clients needing clinical services, but that are currently not engaged or linked with such services. . Several of these include the IHOT programs , the FSP outreach/engagement component, and the Street Outreach Teams of the Trust Clinic. 5) Alameda County is meeting its Prevention and Early Interventio n regulatory requirements. There are several programs that provide relapse support , including the Suicide Prevention Text Line, Transition Age Youth Resource Centers, and the MH applications. In the future , ACBH will work towards clarifying th e scope and efficacy of this work in the Annual Updates and Three -Year Plan. 6) The Full Service Partnerships and 9 Cal. Code of Reg. 3620(k) states that if an FSP client requires short term treatment and stabilization in an acute and/or sub -acute hospital setting and there is no other funding source such as Medi -Cal or private insurance , then this is allowed under MHSA . Funding for services would then become a billing matter between ACBH and the treatment entity. This arrangement is built into the FSP program; to clearly explain this, the MHSA team will make this more explicit in future FSP description s. 20. Submitted by Clara Matta, in behalf of Preet Sabharwal In 2010, we became ACBHCS' contractor for provision of specialized prevention and early intervention (PEI) services to the South Asian population with Mental Health Services Act (MHSA) Unserved and Underserved Ethnic and Linguisti c Languages (UELP) PEI funding. We are the main provider in Alameda County for this population, currently serving Afghanis, Bangladeshis, Bhutanese, Asian Indians including Fiji Islanders, Iranians, Maldivians, Nepalese, Pakistanis, and Sri Lankans. Our culturally reflective approach to services includes staffing with linguistic competency in the most frequently spoken languages of the South Asian population. In support of cultural competency for this population, we hire, train and supervise, using an ind ividual and peer group approach that ensures we are attuned to the histories, norms, values and cultural practices of our priority population. We are committed to an ongoing process of further education about home country cultural norms, current events, an d new trends in immigration from South Asia in order to understand the implications for those we serve. The South Asian Community Health Promotion Services (SACHPS) program at The Hume Center provides advocacy, training, education, outreach and engagement in a variety of ways. SACHPS will be the host program for this procurement. It shares resources through tabling in the events organized by different local Community Based Organizations. It hosts training and workshops for leaderships of local organizatio ns, community elders/leaders, and faith leaders. It hosts educational workshops for local school districts, focusing on admin staff, teachers and administration to help them understand the unique needs of South Asian children and families. It advocates for immigrants and refugees to local government entities within the greater Bay Area (Alameda County & Contra Costa County) to prioritize mental health services for these unserved and underserved communities. It 4/30/23 APPENDIX F-1: MHSA UPDATE PUBLIC COMMENTS854 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Page 17 of 23 collaborates with Asian Pacific Islander coalit ions and other mental health service providers to advocate to enhance access to community resources during the COVID -19 pandemic. It conducts community events such as Kite Festival, Art workshops etc. for community engagement in Alameda county during the p andemic. It distributes resource flyers to educate community members about the DOs and DON'Ts during the pandemic. It hands out hygiene kits in the community with free hand sanitizers, masks, soaps and other personal protective items. It organizes health a wareness and education programs with free health camps in collaboration with other community organizations for the undocumented and uninsured immigrant and refugee families. It hosts Rental Relief Information sessions to help connect community members to f unding for those struggling with housing during the pandemic. It hosts virtual town halls for the Punjabi and Hindi speaking communities to address the importance of emotional wellness, help increase awareness of services across different modalities (prima ry care, community mental health, faith based services and holistic healing). It consults with Fremont Unified School District, New Haven Unified School District, Kaiser Permanente, Washington Hospital, Palo Alto Medical Foundation and other local agencie s serving the South Asian community to help increase awareness about the importance of members' mental health. It collaborates with these organizations to create linguistic and culturally appropriate educational sessions on mental health topics. It creat es a drop in socializing support groups in Hindi, Farsi, Punjabi and English. We believe that prevention and early intervention are essential for an improved continuum of care. Our prevention strategies re -frame mental health and behavioral health care f rom a pathological perspective to a strength -based, normative, developmental assets focus. Working with immigrants and refugees we understand that they often come from collectivistic cultures, and so we adapt our services so that we are addressing collect ive wellness, rather than just focusing on individuals within the community. We understand that immigrant and refugee communities rely on their families and community for support in times of distress. Family, community, and religion are a huge part of bui lding resilience for those that we work with. We adjust our approaches to include these protective factors as a part of our work. When we work with immigrant and refugee communities we incorporate these holistic, cultural and religious forms of healing int o our services to help build rapport, break stigmas around mental health and increase participation. (Examples: yoga workshops, badminton and soccer groups, prayer & meditation). We offer family education and consultation to help educate and increase aware ness for families struggling with loved ones with a mental health disorder. We also offer family focused trauma informed care to help address domestic/family violence, immigration trauma and acculturation stress. Our work is focused on strengthening relati onships within families and communities. (Offering parent/child workshops, offering community gatherings, engaging families in play through art and games). Case Examples: A subpopulation within the South Asian community that we have experience working wit h is survivors of Domestic Violence. We work closely with local DV agencies to help support the mental health and emotional wellness of survivors. DV issues are extremely complex for immigrant and refugee communities. One of the participants, a South Asian woman from Nepal, connected with a SA male who lives in California via social media. He traveled to Nepal to marry her and both of them came to California. They had a baby, and after a few months, he started to physically and APPENDIX F-1: MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE PUBLIC COMMENTS855 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Page 18 of 23 sexually assault her. The not ion in their culture was that the husband had sexual entitlement to his wife's body and she did not have the right to refuse him. He also did not apply for her green card even though he was a U.S. citizen as a means of controlling her. One of the community members connected with Hume, and Prem was able to help her with legal and emotional health resources. We were able to connect with her with legal support services and she was able to file independently for a green card, which she received, allowing her to stay in the country while also divorcing her abusive husband. She received emotional health services throughout and began going to school. She was provided with financial assistance, food assistance, and legal support services to help her become a healthy and functioning member of society. We also work with a lot of complex trauma related to immigration utilizing trauma - informed techniques to help community members share their stories with each other in collective spaces so that they feel validated and fin d commonalities with others. There has been a recent focus on Afghan refugees, who have been not only displaced from their home country but also have had to leave behind family such as their own children or partners. We were working with a young pregnant woman who left Afghanistan with her young children without her spouse because he was not allowed to leave the country with her. She described being physically torn from the arms of her spouse by members of the local government. When they arrived in the USA , her children were sent to a different processing center than her. They were eventually reunited and arrived in Fremont, CA in December 2021. She was hesitant at first to access resources to help her resettle and struggled to trust governmental systems. S he attended a newly arrived Afghan Resource event put on in collaboration between the Hume Center, Fremont Unified School district, and other local community based organizations. We met her when she arrived at the Hume table and she picked up one of our tr anslated pamphlets that addressed sleep. She began to talk about recurring nightmares and fear of separation from her family. She also shared that she was trying to get some legal support to help get her spouse to the USA before their child was born. We of fered her some sessions with one of our consultants and also connected her to some support groups for newly -arrived Afghan women. Through her work with our consultant, she received appropriate legal, medical and mental health resources. Through the support group, she began to feel validated and did not feel re -traumatized when sharing her story and began to show some post -traumatic growth. We also work with a lot of immigrant families struggling with Immigration stress, Acculturation Stress, intergeneratio nal trauma , intergenerational communication difficulties and family dynamic issues. We work with a lot of youth who are struggling with their emotional wellness due to family struggles. We are able to meet these students at their schools, at their homes a nd in the community, alleviating a lot of the barriers in treatment. We also are able to communicate and understand their families cultural and linguistic needs, allowing us to build trust with the families and break stigmas around receiving prevention ser vices. The state of California held a coalition of providers who serve Afghans during the most recent incident to collaborate with each agency, there was looking at funding to draw down to help them with shelter and preparing new materials to link them to Medi -Cal in getting emergency health insurance, locally within AC there were identified professionals who serve the Afghan Communities who we collaborated with to train and educate the other professional so that they're aware of the culture and the proce ss of refugee and the APPENDIX F-1: MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE PUBLIC COMMENTS856 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Page 19 of 23 burden of obtaining asylum and how that can impact their placement. working with different government institutes and various community based organizations how we advocated for that community in Sacramento, Stockton and Fremont. We ha ve also been supporting Nepalese asylum seekers to connect with immigration and legal resources. Most of them are struggling to gain political asylum, and some are undocumented and don't know where to go and how to get immigration support. We assist them i n getting access to immigration support and resources. They struggle with a long family separation period, as they cannot bring them here because they have no legal status. In Nepal, there has been a decades -long political conflict and period of religious persecution that has led many people to flee their country and try to settle in the United States. Part of getting asylum is that they will have to undergo a psychological assessment, which we provide at the Hume Center, or partner with organizations and i nterpreters for such services. We have staff internally who can directly provide services in their language. Strategies for Clients of All Age Groups, Genders, and Sexual Orientations: Our prevention counseling/visits strategy are tailored to serve divers e clients across this range of differences in the following ways: When engaging children in conversations regarding bullying, etc., our program creates bookmarks (anger/sadness busters) which give children different strategies to cope with different emotio ns. For parents who hesitate to talk about their problems we have success if we position participation in services as a way to both improve themselves and benefit their children. Often elders are excited by the attention to their issues and history (their \"story\"). After we engage with them, mood and functional improvements often occur. When adult children see their elders reinvigorated, it relieves family stress and alerts them to ways they can re -energize their relationships with them. To help LGBTQ yout h achieve a prideful self -acceptance, we link them to South Asian -specific resources such as the journal Trikone and DEKH, a national hotline. They may also fear for their physical safety within their families should they come out. This requires work with their families so that youth can come out in a safe manner. Parents also need assistance to overcome shame and disappointment. FISCAL 2021 -2022 Served : 1,387 community members The South Asian Community Health Promotion Services Program works closely w ith community leaders. Consultants from the SACHPS program have been working with the Sikh faith based community by working closely with community leaders, elders and faith leaders. Due to the large stigma surrounding mental health care we build these rela tionships with community stakeholders because these stakeholders already have built strong trusted relationships with the community and have more access to them. Consultants from SACHPS met with these leaders/stakeholders in person at the Fremont Gurdwara and also met with them via zoom during the pandemic. During these meetings we were able to provide education and awareness around suicide prevention, substance use vs abuse, how to identify mental health challenges, domestic violence prevention, and health y communication within families. We also did consultation work to understand what resources the leaders were aware of and how they shared resources with the community. We also shared additional resources with the leaders, particularly focusing on informati on on types of mental health services available, referral processes, language access , and information on providers that identify as being from the Punjabi community and are of Sikh faith. We also spoke about how to address basic resources such as educatio n, housing, childcare, and food distributions. We used role play to understand how APPENDIX F-1: MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE PUBLIC COMMENTS857 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Page 20 of 23 conversations were conducted when family members approached the community leaders and helped leaders adapt more strength based on de -stigmatizing language when talking abou t Mental Health challenges. We also increased awareness around the importance of prevention, emphasizing that mental health care can be accessed prior to a diagnosis or crisis. ACBH/MHSA Response: Thank you for your public comment. ACBH appreciates its partnership with the Portia Bell Hume Center. 21. Tori Casonova Dear AC MHSA staff, Please revise the AC MHSA plan to allocate adequate funds for Hospital Beds and Subacute Secure Facility Beds. My son suffers from Severe Mental Illness (bipolar 1 disorder) and lives in Oakland. The lack of secure facilities for medically necessary treatment repeatedly risked my son's life and is responsible for the time he spent in jail due to symptoms of his untreated illness. Our love d ones should have a right to treatment in hospital beds, not jails. John George Psychiatric Hospital staff tell us the lack of hospital beds and subacute secure facilities are the primary cause of chronic premature discharges and the costly dangerous revolving door. My son has prematurely fled from every voluntary community -based facility against medical advice because, when very ill, he cannot recognize he is ill. In our experience, all psychiatric professionals and mental health crisis w orkers agree there is a huge shortage of state -of-the-art therapeutic properly funded secure facilities. Providers constantly suffer the moral injury of deciding whose life to risk with premature discharge or non -admission. MHSA money can and should be used to help those in locked settings when medically necessary. Our system has a grave shortage of hospital beds and subacute beds. ACBH/MHSA Response: Thank you for your public comment. ACBH continues to develop programs and services for the most severely mentally ill , including crisis stabilization, crisis residential and peer respite services. Additional work and funding for hospital services may occur with other funding than MHSA funds , such as the Behavioral Health Continuum Infrastructur e program (BHCIP), per the following regulation set forth in the California Code of Regulations, Section 3620 : Long term hospital and/or long -term institutional care cannot be paid for with MHSA funds. 4/30/23 22. Families Advocating for the Seriously Mentally Ill (FASMI) Hello Ms. Hazelton and others at Alameda County Behavioral Health, Here are comments from my organization Families Advocating for the Seriously Mentally Ill (https://acfasmi.org/ ) on the recently released Mental Health Services Act (MHSA) three -year plan posted here . Our organization represents many family members of people with serious mental illness\u2014 biological illnesses like schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and serious bipolar disorder. Our family members are in very large part homeless or in jail, or at risk of being so, and many have died before their time. We belie ve our system should be evaluated from the point of view of how well it 4/30/23 APPENDIX F-1: MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE PUBLIC COMMENTS858 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Page 21 of 23 keeps our family members, the original constituency of the Mental Health Services Act, alive and well, off the street, and out of jail. The Mental Health Services Act has failed to fulfill its goal of helping the seriously mentally ill. It is a scattershot assortment of charitable projects, most of which do some good, but are not part of a unified, responsible continuum of care that would provide what is needed to keep our family me mbers alive and well. Regarding our county's mental health system, we agree with Tom Abate's reaction in the attached East Bay Times article, and with the Grand Jury report . Our system lacks a comprehensive assessment of who needs what kind of help and where it should come from. As the Grand Jury said, current funding decisions are \"shooting in the dark.\" If an assessment were done of the unmet needs of our family members, it would most likely discover that hospital beds (as opposed to beds in jail) are in woefully short supply in our county and others, and are probably the most critical missing link in our broken system. Yet no such assessment has been done. To make things worse, state bureaucrats persist in believing that MHSA money cannot be spent on treatment in locked facilities. But that has always been wrong: Attorney Mary Ann Bernard shows that MH SA mandates the funding of such treatment when it is medically necessary (see attached memo). The MHSA system, a patchwork of charities full of gaps, is no substitute for a right to treatment. Such a right should be codified statewide for all people with SMI: the right to be kept alive and well even if they do not ask for help or do not know they are ill. I'd like our county to fight in Sacramento for such a right. Our entire system should be evaluated on whether it keeps our family members alive, health y, off the street, and out of jail. I'm sorry to have to say that MHSA, as implemented in our county and our state, has failed our family members for years, and this plan is unfortunately another step in a failed direction. We do appreciate the wealth o f detail in this plan, and will go back to it for information, but wish it contained some quantitative assessment of unmet need. Here are some further points we'd like to raise: MHSA was intended to help the seriously mentally ill \u2014people with serious brai n illnesses like schizophrenia and bipolar-- but this plan directs much effort to those who are not seriously mentally ill. Racial equity and gender dysphoria are serious problems but they are not the serious mental illnesses that MHSA was intended to addr ess. We actually don't think \"reducing stigma\" is a truly fundamental need. Perhaps we would aim instead at \"reducing denial\" of serious mental illness as a real biological illness. \"Prevention,\" in Prevention and Early Intervention, should aim at all sta ges of serious mental illness to prevent the irreversible damage that occurs without treatment. PEI programs should not only intervene early when the illnesses first manifest in late teens and early adulthood, but also to intervene later to prevent relapse or further deterioration in those whom the system failed to help early in the course of their illness. Intervention much earlier to \"prevent\" serious mental illness in school -age children may not be realistic. APPENDIX F-1: MHSA ANNUAL PLAN UPDATE PUBLIC COMMENTS859 MHSA THREE-YEAR PLAN FOR FY23/26 - DRAFT | SUBMIT COMMENTS ONLINE AT HTTPS://ACMHSA.ORG Page 22 of 23 The public participation process is cumberso me and dilutes the voices of those who are the only representatives of their loved one's interests \u2014that is, the relatives of the seriously mentally ill. Inviting comment on an 800 -page document is disempowering. People doing everything it takes to keep a family member alive do not generally have time to write such comments. Family members need to be integrated into decision making in other ways. MHSA money could do more to address the shortage of licensed permanent supportive housing (board -and-cares for example, and Psynergy -style licensed housing with services onsite). Full service partnerships (FSPs) are not the only way to support people outside institutions. A full service partnership combined with housing doesn't necessarily provide enough support to a person with serious mental illness. A visit once a week is no substitute for providing services where people live (as at Psynergy) or providing daily activities (like Psynergy and like the IOP/PHP program at Highland and Fairmont). This plan lists man y services (FSPs for example) who attempt to demonstrate their success by the lower rate of hospitalization and/or incarceration among those who stay engaged with their services. But our family members often drop out and do not stay engaged with such serv ices. Are we sure these results are not based on cherry -picking? Could it be that those clients who stay engaged are those whose illness is mild enough to avoid negative engagements with the system? \"Is anyone better off?\" is a standard evaluation questi on for the programs our county funds with MHSA money. This is not a strong test. Any program run by good people will help someone. But our family members need reliable help to stay alive and well, they are difficult to help, and contractor -run programs will shed clients who can't be helped. Finally, Community Conservatorship (see page 151) seems to have shifted its emphasis to serving people who have been in Napa and similar state hospitals. This is new. There is a need for programs like this for peop le with SMI who have not yet been in Napa. Thank you for this opportunity to comment. ACBH/MHSA Response: Thank you for your public comment . Your public comment letter will be forwarded to the ACBH Leadership Team. 23.
