Approved March 10, 2003 CHAPTER 32 (SJR 18) A JOINT RESOLUTION petitioning the United States Congress to propose an Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, for submission to the several States, to allow the people of the United States and the several States the freedom to exercise their religion in public places. WHEREAS, the Ten Commandments appear over the bench where the United States Supreme Court Justices sit, thus showing the source from whence our laws and the government power of the state are derived; and WHEREAS, America's colonial governments adopted the Ten Commandments not as an object of worship or an icon, but as the basis for their civil and criminal law, as illustrated on April 3, 1644, when the New Haven Colony Charter was adopted establ ishing that: \"the judicial laws of God, as they were delivered to Moses be a rule to all courts in this jurisdiction\"; and WHEREAS, when signing the Declaration of Independence on August 2, 1776, Samuel Adams, the \"Father of the Revolution\" emphasized its Biblical presuppositions: \"We have this day restored the Sovereign to whom all men ought to be obedient. He reigns in heaven and from the rising to the setting of the sun, let His kingdom come\"; and WHEREAS, on August 20, 1789, Congressman Fisher Ames fr om Massachusetts proposed the wording of the First Amendment which was adopted by the House of Representatives in the first session of the Congress of the United States; and his writings clearly demonstrate that the Framers never intended the First Amendment to be so interpreted as to remove the Bible from the public buildings: \"We are spending less time in the classroom on the Bible which should be the principal text in our schools ...\"; and CHAPTER 32 79 Legislative Research Commission PDF Version WHEREAS, in a letter dated August 18, 1790, President George Washi ngton wrote to the Hebrew Congregation in Newport, Rhode Island, \"All possess alike liberty if conscience and immunities of citizenship... May the children of the stock of Abraham, who dwell in this land, continue to merit and enjoy the good will of the other inhabitants; while every one shall sit in safety under his own vine and fig tree, and there shall be none to make him afraid\"; and WHEREAS, in his \"Farewell Address\" of September 19, 1796, George Washington pointed out the connection between the faith o f the Nation and its political prosperity when he declared: \"Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports ...\", and WHEREAS, acknowledging the Bible as an integral part of the fabric of our society on September 11, 1777, the Continental Congress adopted a resolution to import 20,000 Bibles from Holland and Scotland, as the colonies were at war with England; and WHEREAS, on May 29, 1845, the day before his death, President Andrew Jack son stated: \"My lamp of life is nearly out, and the last glimmer has come. I am ready to depart when called. The Bible is true. The principles and statutes of the Holy Book have been the rule of my life, and I have tried to conform to its spirit as nearly as possible. Upon that sacred volume I rest my hope for eternal salvation, through the merits and blood of our blessed Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ\"; and WHEREAS, President John Quincy Adams, the sixth President of the United States, wrote concerning the civil function of the Mosaic law: \"The law given from Sinai was a civil and municipal as well as a moral and religious code: it contained many statutes ...of universal application - laws essential to the existence of men in society and most of which have been enacted by every nation which ever professed any code of laws\"; and WHEREAS, in a June, 1778 letter to her son, John Quincy Adams, Abigail Adams reinforced noble values and a sense of ultimate accountability to God which she believed to be the foundati on of true greatness: \"Great learning and superior abilities, should you ever possess them, will be of little value and small estimation, unless virtue, honor, truth, and integrity are added to them. Adhere to those religious sentiments and principles which were early instilled into your mind, and remember that you are accountable to your Maker for all your words and actions\"; and WHEREAS, on February 29, 1892, the United States Supreme Court, in a unanimous decision, which has never been overruled, cited sixty -six organic authorities which show the Bible's singular influence on America: \"There is no dissonance in these declarations. There is a universal language pervading them all having one meaning: they affirm and reaffirm that this is a religious nation. These are not individual sayings, declarations of private persons; they are organic utterances; they speak the voice of the entire group. These authorities were collected to support the historical conclusion that 'no purpose of action against religion ca n be imputed to any legislation, state or nation, because this is a religious people. This is historically true. From the discovery of this continent to the present hour, there is a single voice making this affirmation ... we find everywhere a clear recognition of the same truth ...this is a Christian nation' \"; and WHEREAS, on May 7, 1911, President Woodrow Wilson, addressing the Tercentenary Celebration of the Translation of the Bible into the English language, stated, \"Moreover, the Bible does what is so in valuable in human life - it classifies moral values. It apprises us that men are not judged according to their wits, but according to their characters - that the last of every man's reputation is his truthfulness, his squaring his conduct with the standards that he knew to be the standards of purity and rectitude. How many a man we appraise, ladies and gentlemen, as great today whom we do not admire as noble! A man may have great power and small character\"; and \"The Bible has had a critical impact upon the development of Western civilization. Western literature, art and music are filled with images and ideas that can be traced to its pages. More important, our moral tradition has been shaped by the laws and teachings it contains. It was a biblical view of man - one affirming the dignity and worth of the human person, made in the image of our Creator - that inspired the principles upon which the United States is founded. President Jackson called the Bible 'the rock on which our republic rests' because he knew that it shaped the Founding Fathers' concept of individual liberty and their vision of a free and just society. The Bible has not only influenced the development of our Nation's values and institutions, but also enriched the daily lives of millions of men and women who have looked to it for comfort, hope and guidance. On the American frontier, the Bible was often the only book a family owned. For those pioneers living far from any church or school, it served both as a source of religious instruction and as the primary text from which children learned to read. The historical speeches of Abraham Lincoln and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. provide compelling evidence of the role Scripture played in shaping the struggle against slavery and discrimination. Today the Bible continues to give courage and direction to those who seek truth and righteousness. In recognizing its enduring value, we recall the words of the prophet Isaiah, who declared 'The grass withereth, the 80 ACTS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY flower fadeth; but the word of our God shall stand forever.' Containing revelations of God's intervention in human history, the Bible offers moving testimony to His love for mankind. Treasuring the Bible as a source of knowledge and inspiration, President Abraham Lincoln called this Great Book 'the best gift God has given to man.' President Lincoln believed that the Bible not only reveals the infinite goodness of our Creator, but also reminds us of our worth as individuals and our responsibilities toward one another\"; and WHEREAS, the First Amendment in t he Bill of Rights states, \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peacefully to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances\"; and WHEREAS, recent court rulings have prevented the displaying of the Ten Commandments and have been the cause of the removal of these documents from public buildings; and WHEREAS, eighty percent of the peop le are in favor of displaying the Ten Commandments in public places; and WHEREAS, the General Assembly finds the Ten Commandments to be the precedent legal code of the Commonwealth which has provided the foundation for many of the civil and criminal statutes enacted into law throughout the history of the Commonwealth; and WHEREAS, under Article V of the Constitution of the United States, Amendments to said Constitution may be proposed by the United States Congress whenever two -thirds of both chambers deem it necessary; NOW, THEREFORE, Be it resolved by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky: Section 1. The General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, a majority of all members of the chambers voting separately to concur herein, hereby petitions the United States Congress to propose an Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, for submission to the several States for ratification, to allow the people of the United States and the several States the freedom to exercise their re ligion in public places. Section 2. The text of the proposed Amendment to the Constitution of the United States should read substantially as follows: \"Nothing in the Constitution shall be construed to prohibit or otherwise limit the practice of individual or group prayer, the reading or the posting of the Ten Commandments, the recital of the Pledge of Allegiance, and the display of the motto 'In God We Trust' or similar phrases from historical documents referencing God in any public place, including a s chool; nor shall it require any person to join in prayer or other religious activity.\" Section 3. Certified copies of this joint resolution shall be transmitted by the Secretary of State to the Administrator of General Services of the United States, to the President of the United States Senate, to the Speaker of the House of Representatives of the United States, to each member of the Commonwealth's delegation to the Congress of the United States, and to the presiding officer of each house of each state l egislature of the several States.

Approved March 12, 2003 CHAPTER 50 (HJR 116) A JOINT RESOLUTION petitioning the United States Congress to propose an Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, for submission to the several States, to allow the people of the Un ited States and the several States the freedom to exercise their religion in public places. WHEREAS, the Ten Commandments appear over the bench where the United States Supreme Court Justices sit, thus showing the source from whence our laws and the government power of the state are derived; and WHEREAS, America's colonial governments adopted the Ten Commandments not as an object of worship or an icon, but as the basis for their civil and criminal law, as illustrated on April 3, 1644, when the New Haven Co lony Charter was adopted establishing that: \"the judicial laws of God, as they were delivered to Moses be a rule to all courts in this jurisdiction\"; and WHEREAS, when signing the Declaration of Independence on August 2, 1776, Samuel Adams, the \"Father of the Revolution\" emphasized its Biblical presuppositions: \"We have this day restored the Sovereign to whom all men ought to be obedient. He reigns in heaven and from the rising to the setting of the sun, let His kingdom come\"; and WHEREAS, on August 20, 1 789, Congressman Fisher Ames from Massachusetts proposed the wording of the First Amendment which was adopted by the House of Representatives in the first session of the Congress of the United States; and his writings clearly demonstrate that the Framers never intended the First Amendment to be so interpreted as to remove the Bible from the public buildings: \"We are spending less time in the classroom on the Bible which should be the principal text in our schools ...\"; and WHEREAS, in a letter dated August 1 8, 1790, President George Washington wrote to the Hebrew Congregation in Newport, Rhode Island, \"All possess alike liberty if conscience and immunities of citizenship... May the children of the stock of Abraham, who dwell in this land, continue to merit and enjoy the good will of the other inhabitants; while every one shall sit in safety under his own vine and fig tree, and there shall be none to make him afraid\"; and WHEREAS, in his \"Farewell Address\" of September 19, 1796, George Washington pointed out the connection between the faith of the Nation and its political prosperity when he declared: \"Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports ...\"; and WHEREAS, acknowledging the Bible as an integral part of the fabric of our society on September 11, 1777, the Continental Congress adopted a resolution to import 20,000 Bibles from Holland and Scotland, as the colonies were at war with England; and WHEREAS, on May 29, 1845, the day before h is death, President Andrew Jackson stated: \"My lamp of life is nearly out, and the last glimmer has come. I am ready to depart when called. The Bible is true. The principles and statutes of the Holy Book have been the rule of my life, and I have tried to conform to its spirit as nearly as possible. Upon that sacred volume I rest my hope for eternal salvation, through the merits and blood of our blessed Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ\"; and WHEREAS, President John Quincy Adams, the sixth President of the Unit ed States, wrote concerning the civil function of the Mosaic law: \"The law given from Sinai was a civil and municipal as well as a moral and religious code: it contained many statutes ...of universal application - laws essential to the existence of men in society and most of which have been enacted by every nation which ever professed any code of laws\"; and WHEREAS, in a June, 1778 letter to her son, John Quincy Adams, Abigail Adams reinforced noble values and a sense of ultimate accountability to God which she believed to be the foundation of true greatness: \"Great learning and superior abilities, should you ever possess them, will be of little value and small estimation, unless virtue, honor, 128 ACTS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY truth, and integrity are added to them. Adhere to those religious sentiments and principles which were early instilled into your mind, and remember that you are accountable to your Maker for all your words and actions\"; and WHEREAS, on February 29, 1892, the United States Supreme Court, in a unanimous decision, which h as never been overruled, cited sixty -six organic authorities which show the Bible's singular influence on America: \"There is no dissonance in these declarations. There is a universal language pervading them all having one meaning: they affirm and reaffirm that this is a religious nation. These are not individual sayings, declarations of private persons; they are organic utterances; they speak the voice of the entire group. These authorities were collected to support the historical conclusion that 'no purpos e of action against religion can be imputed any legislation, state or nation, because this is a religious people. This is historically true. From the discovery of this continent to the present hour, there is a single voice making this affirmation ... we find everywhere a clear recognition of the same truth ...this is a Christian nation'\"; and WHEREAS, on May 7, 1911, President Woodrow Wilson, addressing the Tercentenary Celebration of the Translation of the Bible into the English language, stated, \"Moreover, t he Bible does what is so invaluable in human life - it classifies moral values. It apprises us that men are not judged according to their wits, but according to their characters - that the last of every man's reputation is his truthfulness, his squaring his conduct with the standards that he knew to be the standards of purity and rectitude. How many a man we appraise, ladies and gentlemen, as great today whom we do not admire as noble! A man may have great power and small character\"; and \"The Bible has had a critical impact upon the development of Western civilization. Western literature, art and music are filled with images and ideas that can be traced to its pages. More important, our moral tradition has been shaped by the laws and teachings it contains. It was a biblical view of man - one affirming the dignity and worth of the human person, made in the image of our Creator - that inspired the principles upon which the United States is founded. President Jackson called the Bible 'the rock on which our repub lic rests' because he knew that it shaped the Founding Fathers' concept of individual liberty and their vision of a free and just society. The Bible has not only influenced the development of our Nation's values and institutions, but also enriched the daily lives of millions of men and women who have looked to it for comfort, hope and guidance. On the American frontier, the Bible was often the only book a family owned. For those pioneers living far from any church or school, it served both as a source of re ligious instruction and as the primary text from which children learned to read. The historical speeches of Abraham Lincoln and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. provide compelling evidence of the role Scripture played in shaping the struggle against slavery and discrimination. Today the Bible continues to give courage and direction to those who seek truth and righteousness. In recognizing its enduring value, we recall the words of the prophet Isaiah, who declared 'The grass withereth, the flower fadeth; but the word of our God shall stand forever.' Containing revelations of God's intervention in human history, the Bible offers moving testimony to His love for mankind. Treasuring the Bible as a source of knowledge and inspiration, President Abraham Lincoln called this Great Book 'the best gift God has given to man.' President Lincoln believed that the Bible not only reveals the infinite goodness of our Creator, but also reminds us of our worth as individuals and our responsibilities toward one another\"; and WHEREA S, the First Amendment in the Bill of Rights states, \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peacefully to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances\"; and WHEREAS, recent court rulings have prevented the displaying of the Ten Commandments and have been the cause of the removal of these documents from public buildings; and WHEREAS, eighty percent of the people are in favor of displaying the Ten Commandments in public places; and WHEREAS, the General Assembly finds the Ten Commandments to be the precedent legal code of the Commonwealth which has provided the foundation for many of the civil and criminal statutes enacted into law throughout the history of the Commonwealth; and WHEREAS, under Article V of the Constitution of the United States, Amendments to said Constitution may be proposed by the United States Congress whenever two -thirds of both chambers deem it necessary; NOW, THEREFORE, Be it resolved by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky: Section 1. The General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, a majority of all members of the chambers voting separately to concur herein, hereby petitions the United States Congress to propose an Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, for submission to the several States for ratification, to allow the people of the United States and the several States the f reedom to exercise their religion in public places. CHAPTER 50 129 Legislative Research Commission PDF Version Section 2. The text of the proposed Amendment to the Constitution of the United States should read substantially as follows: \"Nothing in the Constitution shall be construed to prohibit or otherwise limit the practice of individual or group prayer, the reading or the posting of the Ten Commandments, the recital of the Pledge of Allegiance, and the display of the motto 'In God We Trust' or similar phrases from historical documents referencing God in any public place, including a school; nor shall it require any person to join in prayer or other religious activity.\" Section 3. Certified copies of this joint resolution shall be transmitted by the Secretary of State to the Administrator of General Services of the United States, to the President of the United States Senate, to the Speaker of the House of Representatives of the United States, to each member of the Commonwealth's delegation to the Congress of the United States, and to the presiding officer of each house of each state legislature of the several States.

Approved March 12, 2003 CHAPTER 55 (HB 225) AN ACT relating to annuities. Be it ena cted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky: Section 1. KRS 304.15 -315 is amended to read as follows: (1) This section shall be known as the \"Standard Nonforfeiture Law for Individual Deferred Annuities.\" (2) This section shall not apply to any reinsurance group annuity purchased under a retirement plan or plan of deferred compensation established or maintained by an employer (including a partnership or sole proprietorship) or by an employee organization, or by both, other than a plan providing individual retirement accounts or individual retirement annuities under Section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code, as now or hereafter amended, premium deposit fund, variable annuity, investment annuity, immediate annuity, any deferred annuity contract after annuity payments have commenced, or reversionary annuity, nor to any contract which shall be delivered outside this state through an agent or other representative of the insurer issuing the contract. (3) In the case of contracts issued on or a fter the operative date of this section as defined in subsection (12) of this section, no contract of annuity, except as stated in subsection (2) of this section, shall be delivered or issued for delivery in this state unless it contains in substance the following provisions, or corresponding provisions which in the opinion of the commissioner are at least as favorable to the contract holder, upon cessation of payment of considerations under the contract. (a) That upon cessation of payment of consideration s under a contract, the insurer will grant a paid -up annuity benefit on a plan stipulated in the contract of such value as is specified in subsections (5), (6), (7), (8) and (10) of this section. 148 ACTS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY (b) If a contract provides for a lump sum settlement at maturity, or at any other time, that upon surrender of the contract at or prior to the commencement of any annuity payments, the insurer will pay in lieu of any paid-up annuity benefit a cash surrender benefit of such amount as is specified in subsections (5) , (6), (8) and (10) of this section. The insurer shall reserve the right to defer the payment of such cash surrender benefit for a period of six (6) months after demand therefor with surrender of the contract. (c) A statement of the mortality table, if any, and interest rates used in calculating any minimum paid -up annuity, cash surrender or death benefits that are guaranteed under the contract, together with sufficient information to determine the amounts of such benefits. (d) A statement that any paid -up annuity, cash surrender or death benefits that may be available under the contract are not less than the minimum benefits required by any statute of the state in which the contract is delivered and an explanation of the manner in which such benefits are altered by the existence of any additional amounts credited by the insurer to the contract, any indebtedness to the insurer on the contract or any prior withdrawals from or partial surrenders of the contract. Notwithstanding the requirements of this subs ection, any deferred annuity contract may provide that if no considerations have been received under a contract for a period of two (2) full years and the portion of the paid-up annuity benefit at maturity on the plan stipulated in the contract arising from considerations paid prior to such period would be less than twenty dollars ($20) monthly, the insurer may at its option terminate such contract by payment in cash of the then present value of such portion of the paid -up annuity benefit, calculated on the basis of the mortality table, if any, and interest rate specified in the contract for determining the paid -up annuity benefit, and by such payment shall be relieved of any further obligation under such contract. (4) The minimum values as specified in subsections (5), (6), (7), (8) and (10) of this section of any paid -up annuity, cash surrender or death benefits available under an annuity contract shall be based upon minimum nonforfeiture amounts as defined in this section. (a) With respect to contracts p roviding for flexible considerations, the minimum nonforfeiture amount at any time at or prior to the commencement of any annuity payments shall be equal to an accumulation up to such time at a rate of interest of three percent (3%) per annum of percentages of the net considerations (as hereinafter defined) paid prior to such time, decreased by the sum of 1. Any prior withdrawals from or partial surrenders of the contract accumulated at a rate of interest of three percent (3%) per annum; and 2. The amount of any indebtedness to the insurer on the contract, including interest due and accrued; and increased by any existing additional amounts credited by the insurer to the contract. The net considerations for a given contract year used to define the minimum nonforfeiture amount shall be an amount not less than zero and shall be equal to the corresponding gross consideration credited to the contract during that contract year less an annual contract charge of thirty dollars ($30) and less a collection charge o f one dollar and twenty -five cents ($1.25) per consideration credited to the contract during that contract year. The percentages of net considerations shall be sixty -five percent (65%) of the net consideration for the first contract year and eighty -seven and one -half percent (87.5%) of the net considerations for the second and later contract years. Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding sentence, the percentage shall be sixty -five percent (65%) of the portion of the total net consideration for any renewal contract year which exceeds by not more than two (2) times the sum of those portions of the net considerations in all prior contract years for which the percentage was sixty -five percent (65%). (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, for any contract issued on or after July 1, 2003, and before July 1, 2005, the interest rate at which net considerations, prior withdrawals, and partial surrenders shall be accumulated for the purpose of determining nonforfeiture amounts shall be no less than one and one -half percent (1.5%) per annum. (c) With respect to contracts providing for fixed scheduled considerations, minimum nonforfeiture amounts shall be calculated on the assumption that considerations are paid annually in advance and shall be defined as for contracts with flexible considerations which are paid annually with two (2) exceptions: 1. The portion of the net consideration for the first contract year to be accumulated shall be the sum of sixty -five percent (65%) of the net consi deration for the first contract year plus twenty -two and CHAPTER 55 149 Legislative Research Commission PDF Version one-half percent (22.5%) of the excess of the net consideration for the first contract year over the lesser of the net considerations for the second and third contract years. 2. The annual contract charge shall be the lesser of, a. Thirty dollars ($30), or b. Ten percent (10%) of the gross annual consideration. (d)[(c)] With respect to contracts providing for a single consideration, minimum nonforfeiture amounts shall be defined as for contracts w ith flexible considerations except that the percentage of net consideration used to determine the minimum nonforfeiture amount shall be equal to ninety percent (90%) and the net consideration shall be the gross consideration less a contract charge of seventy -five dollars ($75). (5) Any paid -up annuity benefit available under a contract shall be such that its present value on the date annuity payments are to commence is at least equal to the minimum nonforfeiture amount on that date. Such present value shal l be computed using the mortality table, if any, and the interest rate specified in the contract for determining the minimum paid -up annuity benefits guaranteed in the contract. (6) For contracts which provide cash surrender benefits, such cash surrender benefits available prior to maturity shall not be less than the present value as of the date of surrender of that portion of the maturity value of the paid-up annuity benefit which would be provided under the contract at maturity arising from consideration s paid prior to the time of cash surrender reduced by the amount appropriate to reflect any prior withdrawals from or partial surrenders of the contract, such present value being calculated on the basis of an interest rate not more than one percent (1%) higher than the interest rate specified in the contract for accumulating the net considerations to determine such maturity value, decreased by the amount of any indebtedness to the insurer on the contract, including interest due and accrued, and increased by any existing additional amounts credited by the insurer to the contract. In no event shall any cash surrender benefit be less than the minimum nonforfeiture amount at that time. The death benefit under such contracts shall be at least equal to the cash surrender benefit. (7) For contracts which do not provide cash surrender benefits, the present value of any paid -up annuity benefit available as a nonforfeiture option at any time prior to maturity shall not be less than the present value of that portion of the maturity value of the paid -up annuity benefit provided under the contract arising from considerations paid prior to the time the contract is surrendered in exchange for, or changed to, a deferred paid-up annuity, such present value being calculated for the period prior to the maturity date on the basis of the interest rate specified in the contract for accumulating the net considerations to determine such maturity value, and increased by any existing additional amounts credited by the insurer to the co ntract. For contracts which do not provide any death benefits prior to the commencement of any annuity payments, such present values shall be calculated on the basis of such interest rate and the mortality table specified in the contract for determining the maturity value of the paid -up annuity benefit. However, in no event shall the present value of a paid -up annuity benefit be less than the minimum nonforfeiture amount at that time. (8) For the purpose of determining the benefits calculated under subsect ions (6) and (7) of this section, in the case of annuity contracts under which an election may be made to have annuity payments commence at optional maturity dates, the maturity date shall be deemed to be the latest date for which election shall be permitted by the contract, but shall not be deemed to be later than the anniversary of the contract next following the annuitant's seventieth birthday or the tenth anniversary of the contract, whichever is later. (9) Any contract which does not provide cash surr ender benefits or does not provide death benefits at least equal to the minimum nonforfeiture amount prior to the commencement of any annuity payments shall include a statement in a prominent place in the contract that such benefits are not provided. (10) Any paid -up annuity, cash surrender or death benefits available at any time, other than on the contract anniversary under any contract with fixed scheduled considerations, shall be calculated with allowance for the lapse of time and the payment of any sch eduled considerations beyond the beginning of the contract year in which cessation of payment of considerations under the contract occurs. (11) For any contract which provides, within the same contract by rider or supplemental contract provision, both annuity benefits and life insurance benefits that are in excess of the greater of cash surrender benefits or a return of the gross considerations with interest, the minimum nonforfeiture benefits shall be equal to the sum of the minimum nonforfeiture benefits for the annuity portion and the minimum nonforfeiture benefits, if any, for 150 ACTS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY the life insurance portion computed as if each portion were a separate contract. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (5), (6), (7), (8), and (10) of this section, additional benefits payable (a) In the event of total and permanent disability, (b) As reversionary annuity or deferred reversionary annuity benefits, or (c) As other policy benefits additional to life insurance, endowment and annuity benefits, and considerat ions for all such additional benefits, shall be disregarded in ascertaining the minimum nonforfeiture amounts, paid -up annuity, cash surrender and death benefits that may be required by this section. The inclusion of such additional benefits shall not be required in any paid -up benefits, unless such additional benefits separately would require minimum nonforfeiture amounts, paid -up annuity, cash surrender and death benefits. (12) After June 17, 1978, any insurer may file with the commissioner a written n otice of its election to comply with the provisions of this section after a specified date before June 17, 1980. After the filing of such notice, then upon such specified date, this section shall become operative with respect to annuity contracts thereafter issued by such insurer. If an insurer makes no such election, the operative date of this section for such insurer shall be June 17, 1980.

(b) \"Lender\" means any person who funds or negotiates the terms of a high -cost home loan or acts as a mortgage broker or lender, finance company, or retail installment seller with respect to a high -cost home loan. However, any person who purchases or is otherwise assigned a high -cost home loan shal l be subject to an action for violation of this section only if the violation for which the action or proceeding is brought is apparent on the face of the disclosure or the underlying promissory note. (2) A high -cost home loan shall be subject to the following limitations: (a) A high -cost home loan may not contain a provision which permits the lender to charge or collect prepayment fees or penalties more than thirty -six (36) months after the loan closing or which exceed three percent (3%) of the amount p repaid during the first twelve (12) months, two percent (2%) of the amount prepaid during the second twelve (12) months, or one percent (1%) of the amount prepaid during the third twelve (12) months. (b) A high -cost home loan may not contain a provision which permits the lender, in its sole discretion, to accelerate the indebtedness. This provision does not apply when repayment of the loan has been accelerated by default, pursuant to a due -on-sale provision, or pursuant to some other provision of the loan documents unrelated to the payment schedule. (c) A high -cost home loan may not contain a scheduled payment that is more than twice as large as the average of earlier scheduled payments. This provision does not apply when the payment schedule is adjusted to the seasonal or irregular income of the borrower. (d) A high -cost home loan may not contain a payment schedule with regular periodic payments that cause the principal balance to increase. (e) A high -cost home loan may not contain a provision which incr eases the interest rate after default.

(h) A lender may not make a high -cost home loan unless the borrower has been provided the following notice or a substantially similar notice, in writing, not la ter than the time that notice provided by 12 CFR 226.31(c), as amended from time to time, is required: NOTICE TO BORROWER IF YOU OBTAIN THIS LOAN, THE LENDER WILL HAVE A MORTGAGE ON YOUR HOME. YOU COULD LOSE YOUR HOME AND ANY MONEY YOU PUT INTO IT IF YOU DO NOT MEET YOUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE LOAN. CHAPTER 64 175 Legislative Research Commission PDF Version MORTGAGE LOAN RATES AND CLOSING COSTS AND FEES VARY BASED ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING YOUR PARTICULAR CREDIT AND FINANCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES, YOUR EMPLOYMENT HISTORY, THE LOAN -TO-VALUE REQUESTED AND THE TYPE OF PROPERTY THAT WILL SECURE YOUR LOAN. THE LOAN RATE AND FEES COULD ALSO VARY BASED ON WHICH LENDER OR BROKER YOU SELECT. YOU SHOULD SHOP AROUND AND COMPARE LOAN RATES AND FEES. YOU SHOULD ALSO CONSIDER CONSULTING A QUALIFIED INDEPENDENT CREDIT COUNSELOR OR OTHER EXPERIENCED FINANCIAL ADVISOR REGARDING THE RATE, FEES AND PROVISIONS OF THIS MORTGAGE LOAN BEFORE YOU PROCEED. YOU SHOULD CONTACT THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT FOR A LIST OF CREDIT COUNSELORS AVAILABLE IN YOUR AREA. YOU ARE NOT REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THIS LOAN AGREEMENT MERELY BECAUSE YOU HAVE RECEIVED THESE DISCLOSURES OR HAVE SIGNED A LOAN APPLICATION. REMEMBER, PROPERTY TAXES AND HOMEOWNER'S INSURANCE ARE YOUR RESPONSIBILITY. NOT ALL LENDERS PROVIDE ESCROW SERVICES FOR THESE PAYMENTS. YOU SHOULD ASK YOUR LENDER ABOUT THESE SERVICES. ALSO, YOUR PAYMENTS ON EXISTING DEBTS CONTRIBUTE TO YOUR CREDIT RATINGS. YOU SHOULD NOT ACCEPT ANY ADVICE TO IGNORE YOUR REGULAR PAYMENTS TO YOUR EXISTING CREDITORS. (i) A lender m ay not make a high -cost home loan unless the lender reasonably believes at the time the loan is consummated that one (1) or more of the borrowers, when considered individually or collectively, will be able to make the scheduled payments to repay the loan based upon a consideration of their current and expected income, current obligations, current employment status, and other financial resources, other than the borrower's equity in the dwelling which secures repayment of the loan. A borrower shall be presume d to be able to make the scheduled payments to repay the loan if, at the time the loan is consummated, the borrower's total monthly debts, including amounts owed under the loan, do not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the borrower's monthly gross income as verified by the credit application, the borrower's financial statement, a credit report, financial information provided to the lender by or on behalf of the borrower, or any other reasonable means. No presumption of inability to make the scheduled payments t o repay the obligation shall arise solely from the fact that, at the time the loan is consummated, the borrower's total monthly debts, including amounts owed under the loan, exceed fifty percent (50%) of the borrower's monthly gross income. (j) If the proceeds of the high -cost home loan are used to refinance an existing high -cost home loan held by the same lender as noteholder, the lender may not directly or indirectly finance: 1. Any prepayment fees or penalties payable by the borrower; or 2. Points and fees, excluding those provided for in 12 CFR 226.4(c)(7), which in the aggregate are in excess of four percent (4%) of the total amount financed. (k) A lender or mortgage loan broker may not, within one (1) year of the consummation of a high -cost home loan, charge a borrower points and fees in connection with a high -cost home loan if the proceeds of the high -cost home loan are used to refinance an existing high -cost home loan on which points were charged. A lender may not, at any time, charge a borrower p oints and fees in addition to those allowed by 12 CFR 226.4(c)(7) if the proceeds of the high -cost home loan are used to refinance an existing high -cost home loan, on which points were charged, held by the same lender as noteholder. However, points and fees in accordance with this section may be charged on any proceeds of a high -cost home loan which are in excess of the amount refinanced on the existing high -cost home loan. (l) A lender may not pay a contractor under a home -improvement contract from the pr oceeds of a high - cost home loan other than by an instrument payable to the borrower or jointly to the borrower and the contractor, or at the election of the borrower, through a third -party escrow agent in accordance with terms established in a written agreement signed by the borrower, the lender, and the contractor prior to the disbursement. 176 ACTS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY (m) A lender shall not refinance, replace, or consolidate a zero interest rate or low interest rate loan made by a governmental or nonprofit lender with a high -cost ho me loan.

(n) A lender shall not finance single premium credit life, credit accident, credit health, credit disability, or credit loss of income insurance in connection with a high -cost home loan.

A lender shall have available for viewing at least one (1) copy of the video in the principal office and each branch office of the lender. (p) A lender shall not make a high -cost home loan subject to a mandatory arbitration clause that i s oppressive, unfair, unconscionable, or substantially in derogation of the rights of consumers. Arbitration clauses that comply with the standards set forth in the Statement of Principles of the National Consumer Dispute Advisory Committee of the American Arbitration Association in effect on the effective date of this Act shall be presumed not to violate this subsection. (q) A lender shall not charge a late payment fee on a high -cost home loan except in accordance with the following: 1. The late payment fee may not be in excess of five percent (5%) of the amount of the payment past due or ten dollars ($10), whichever is greater; 2. The late payment fee may only be assessed for a payment past due fifteen (15) days or more; and 3. The late payment fee may only be charged once with respect to a single late payment. (r) A lender may not charge a borrower a fee in excess of ten dollars ($10) or actual costs, whichever is greater, per request for a written payoff calculation on a high -cost home loan for the f irst two (2) requests by a borrower in a calendar year. (s) A lender shall not initiate a foreclosure or other judicial process to terminate a borrower's interest in residential real property subject to a high -cost home loan without first providing the borrower, at least thirty (30) days prior to the initiation of any process, written notice of default and of the borrower's right to cure. The notice shall include a statement of the amount needed to be paid by the borrower in order to cure the default and t he date by which the payment is due to cure the default. If the amount needed to be paid will change during the thirty (30) day notice period, the notice shall provide information sufficient to enable a calculation of the daily change. (t) A lender shall not recommend or encourage default on an existing loan or other debt in connection with the closing of a high -cost home loan that refinances all or a portion of the existing loan or debt. (3) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of subsection (2) of this s ection, the making of a high -cost home loan which violates any provisions of subsection (2) of this section is usurious, subject to the penalties of this chapter, and unlawful as an unfair and deceptive act or practice in or affecting commerce in violation of the provisions of KRS 367.170. The provisions of this section shall apply to any person who in bad faith attempts to avoid the application of this section by: (a) The structuring of a loan transaction as an open -end credit plan for the purpose and wit h the intent of evading the provisions of this section when the loan would have been a high -cost home loan if the loan had been structured as a closed -end loan; or (b) Dividing any loan transaction into separate parts for the purpose and with the intent of evading the provisions of this section; or (c) Any other such subterfuge. The Attorney General, the commissioner of the Department of Financial Institutions, or any party to a high -cost home loan may enforce the provisions of this section. Any person seeking damages or penalties under the provisions of this section may recover damages under either this chapter or KRS Chapter 367, but not both. CHAPTER 64 177 Legislative Research Commission PDF Version (4) A lender of a high -cost home loan who, when acting in good faith, fails to comply with subsection (2) of this section, will not be deemed to have violated this section if the lender establishes that either: (a) Within thirty (30) days of the loan closing the borrower is notified of the compliance failure, appropriate restitution is made, and whatever adjust ments are necessary are made, at the choice of the borrower, to the loan to either: 1. Make the high -cost home loan satisfy the requirements of subsection (2) of this section; or 2. Change the terms of the loan in a manner beneficial to the borrower so that the loan will no longer be considered a high -cost home loan subject to the provisions of this section; or (b) The compliance failure was not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adop ted to avoid such errors, and within sixty (60) days after the discovery of the compliance failure, the borrower is notified of the compliance failure, appropriate restitution is made, and whatever adjustments are necessary are made to the loan to either, at the choice of the borrower, make the high -cost home loan satisfy the requirements of subsection (2) of this section or change the terms of the loan in a manner beneficial to the borrower so that the loan will no longer be considered a high -cost home loa n subject to the provisions of this section. Examples of a bona fide error include clerical, calculation, computer malfunction and programming, and printing errors. (c) For purposes of this subsection, \"appropriate restitution\" means the reimbursement by the lender of any points, fees, interest, or other charges made by the lender and received from the borrower necessary to put the borrower in the same position as he or she would have been had the loan, as adjusted in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection, been originally made. (5) For purposes of this section, any extension of credit shall be deemed to have been made in the Commonwealth of Kentucky, and therefore subject to the provisions of this section, if the lender offers or agrees in Kentucky to lend to a borrower, who is a resident of Kentucky, on real property located within the Commonwealth of Kentucky, or if such borrower accepts or makes the offer in Kentucky to borrow, regardless of the situs of the contract as specified ther ein. Any oral or written solicitation or communication to lend originating outside of Kentucky, but forwarded to and received in Kentucky by a borrower who is a resident of Kentucky, shall be deemed to be an offer or agreement to lend in Kentucky and, therefore, subject to this section. Any oral or written solicitation or communication to borrow originating within Kentucky, from a borrower who is a resident of Kentucky, but forwarded to and received by a lender outside of Kentucky, shall be deemed to be an acceptance or offer to borrow in Kentucky. Any oral or written offer, acceptance, solicitation, or communication to lend or borrow, made in Kentucky to, or received in Kentucky from, a borrower who is not a resident of Kentucky, shall be subject to the provisions of this section, applicable federal law, law of the situs of the contract, or law of the residence of the borrower, as the parties may elect. The provisions of this section shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision is dec lared to be invalid, the validity of the remainder of this section shall not be affected thereby.

[ Only when there is an unsatisfied use tax liability on this basis shall the seller be liable for sales tax with respect to the sale of the property to the purchaser. ] (2) If the sole use of the property by the retailer other than retention, demonstration or display in the regular course of business is the rental of the property while holding it for sale, the retailer [purchaser] shall include in [ his] gross receipts the amount of the rental charged rather than the sales price of the property [ to him] .

WHEREAS, the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Kentucky empowers the General Assembly to make appropriations; and WHEREAS, the Kentucky Supreme Court recognizes that the budget, which appropriates the revenue of the Commonwealth and which determines how that revenue shall be spent, is fundamentally a legislative matter; and WHEREAS, the General Assembly has enacted into law the statutory budget process that is primarily codified in KRS Chapter 48; and WHEREAS, the statutes provid e that prior to the passage of a budget bill, the appropriations committees of the General Assembly shall prepare a budget memorandum that shall enumerate the changes made by the appropriations committees in a branch budget recommendation, and that shall explain the changes in detail sufficiently to convey the intent of the appropriations committees; and WHEREAS, the Kentucky Supreme Court has upheld the use of the budget memorandum as a valid part of the statutory process; NOW, THEREFORE, Be it resolved by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky: Section 1. Any mandates, directives, or initiatives contained in the 2002 -2004 State/Executive Branch Budget Memorandum shall have the force and effect of law. Section 2. The staff of the Legislative Research Commission shall have the authority, subject to the approval of the Legislative Research Commission, to make technical or format adjustments to the 2002 -2004 State/Executive Branch Budget Memorandum that do not alter the sense, meaning, or effect of the 2002 -2004 State/Executive Branch Budget Bill or the 2002 -2004 State/Executive Branch Budget Memorandum. Section 3. The provisions of the 2002 -2004 State/Executive Branch Budget Memorandum shall not be construed to contain appropriations and, therefore, shall not supersede appropriations contained in the 2002 -2004 State/Executive Branch Budget Bill or appropriations contained in any other enactment of the 2003 Regular Session of the General Assembly. If any mandate, directive, or initiative contained in the 2002 -2004 State/Executive Branch Budget Bill conflicts with any mandate, directive, or initiative contained in the 2002 -2004 State/Executive Branch Budget Memorandum, the mandate, directive, or initiative contained in the 2002 -2004 State/Executive Branch Budget Bill shall prevail.

(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, within thirty (30) days after July 15, 1988, the cabinet shall list the following compounds as hazardous wastes for the purposes of regulation of the treatment, storage, and disposal of the wastes under the delegated authority of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, 42 U.S.C. 6901 et seq.: (bis(2 -chloroet hyl) sulfide) and related compounds. (3) In addition to the requirements of KRS 224.46 -520(1), the cabinet shall consider the criteria set forth in this subsection in making a determination to issue, deny, or condition a permit for any person desiring a permit to construct or operate a hazardous -waste site or facility for treatment or disposal of any of the compounds identified in subsection (2) of this section. The applicant shall affirmatively demonstrate, and the cabinet shall find prior to issuance, co nditional issuance, or denial of the permit or draft permit, that: (a) The proposed treatment or destruction technology has been fully proven in an operational facility of scale, configuration, and throughput comparable to the proposed facility, or has been demonstrated as effective, within the chemical weapons disposal programs as directed in Pub. L. 104 -208 and other applicable federal laws, sufficient to provide assurance of destruction or neutralization at an efficiency of ninety -nine and nine thousand , nine hundred, and ninety -nine ten thousandths percent (99.9999%) for each compound listed in subsection (2) of this section that is proposed to be treated or destroyed, with the efficiency to be demonstrated as achievable under all operating conditions. During the occurrence of malfunctions, upsets, or unplanned shutdowns, all quantities of any compound listed in subsection (2) of this section shall be contained, reprocessed or otherwise controlled so as to ensure that the required efficiency is attained prior to any release to the environment; CHAPTER 149 1711 Legislative Research Commission PDF Version (b) Monitoring data from an operational facility or alternative disposal program as described in paragraph (a) of this subsection reflects that the emissions from treatment and destruction facilities or fugitive sources, including, but not limited to, the emissions of the compounds identified in subsection (2) of this section and products of combustion, incomplete combustion, and other processes alone or in combination present no more than a minimal risk of acute or chronic human health effect, as demonstrated by sufficient and applicable toxicological data, or adverse environmental effect; and (c) An emergency response plan has been submitted to the cabinet and approved, after public notice and an opportunity to be heard, providing for sufficient training, coordination, and equipment for state and local emergency response personnel, including health, police, fire, and other responders, to assure the ability of the community to respond to releases from such a facilit y. The plan shall demonstrate the capability of evacuating prior to exposure, or otherwise mitigating exposure for all individuals that might be exposed to releases from the facility during a credible worst -case release. In determining the population and area of potential exposure during a worst -case release, all possible climatic conditions and population distributions shall be assumed for the largest area where any exposure to the release could induce acute or chronic health consequences or environmental impact. If such a plan has not been fully implemented at the time of permit approval, the Division of Emergency Management shall advise the cabinet of critical shortcomings. Any permit issued shall include, as conditions, the resolution of critical shortcomings in the implementation of the plan, and shall not allow actual destruction of any of the compounds identified in subsection (2) of this section to begin until those permit conditions have been met to the satisfaction of the Division of Emergency Manag ement. No later than January 1, 2001, the Division of Emergency Management shall complete an assessment of a draft plan previously submitted by the applicant and the respective counties and, after public notice and an opportunity to be heard, shall approve or reject the draft plan. The cabinet shall conduct no technical review of a permit application for treatment or disposal of these compounds until notified in writing by the Division of Emergency Management that the draft plan has been approved . (4) In considering any application for a permit subject to this section, and supporting information which shall be provided by the applicant on request by the cabinet, the cabinet shall not issue a permit unless, as part of the alternatives analysis of KRS 224.46 -520(1), the cabinet makes an affirmative finding after public notice and an opportunity to be heard, that no alternative method of treatment or disposal exists in an operational facility or alternative disposal program as described in subsection (3)(a) of this section that create less risk of release, or acute or chronic health effect, or adverse environmental effect. (5) In addition to the definition of the term as defined in this chapter, the term \"treatment\", as used in this section, shall include the manual or mechanical handling of the chemical compounds listed in subsection (2) of this section and of any munitions containing the compounds during the processing of munitions to remove the compounds, to separate munitions components, and to otherwise pre pare the components and compounds for destruction, neutralization, dismantling, or decommissioning. The term \"treatment\" shall not include the handling, movement, or overpacking of containers or munitions containing a compound listed in subsection (2) of this section within the fenced boundaries of an area used for the storage of those munitions if: (a) A plan for the handling, movement, or overpacking is submitted and approved by the cabinet, after public notice and opportunity to be heard, before the han dling, movement, or overpacking occurs; or (b) An emergency has occurred and the handling, movement, or overpacking is necessary to protect human health, safety, or the environment, if a report describing the handling, movement, or overpacking is submitted to the cabinet as soon as possible after the emergency is abated. (6) No site or facility for treatment or disposal of any of the substances identified in subsection (2) of this section shall be issued a permit to treat or destroy a live chemical agent as a research, development or demonstration permit except for a pilot scale operation. (7) In addition to other requirements of KRS 224.46 -520(1) and subsections (1) to (6) of this section, the cabinet shall not issue a permit or authorization to construct or operate a hazardous waste site or facility for treatment or disposal of any of the compounds identified in subsection (2) of this section unless the applicant provides written documentation from the host county certifying that: (a) All infrastructure improvements identified in the final emergency response plan required in subsection (3)(c) of this section as being reasonably necessary to assure the ability of the community to effectively respond to releases from the facility in order to protect public health and the 1712 ACTS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY environment under the emergency response plan, have been or will be completed by the applicant prior to operation of the facility; (b) The applicant has provided to the host county sufficient funding for reasonable direct and indirect costs of the creation and maintenance of the position of host community liaison. The host community liaison will be determined by the host county and will act as the single point of contact for community relations, emergency planning, and community oversight of the construction, operation, closure, and emergency response of the facility.

All appropriations to existing line -item capital construction projects expire on June 30, 2002, unless reauthorized in this Act with the following exceptions: (1) A construction contract for the project sh all have been awarded by June 30, 2002; (2) Permanent financing or a short -term line of credit sufficient to cover the total authorized project scope shall have been obtained in the case of projects authorized for bonds; (3) Grant or loan agreements, if applicable, shall have been finalized and properly signed by all necessary parties; and (4) Any capital construction project authorized pursuant to actions approved by the 2000 General Assembly House Bill 507 (2000 Ky. Acts ch. 549, Part II, R. Community Dev elopment Projects or S. Coal Severance Tax Projects), unless expressly reauthorized or reallotted in this Act. Any capital construction project authorized pursuant to actions approved by the 2000 General Assembly House Bill 507 (2000 Ky. Acts ch. 549, Part II, R. Community Development Projects or S. Coal Severance Tax Projects), that is not expressly reauthorized or reallotted in this Act is deemed to be reauthorized. Notwithstanding the criteria set forth in this section, the disposition of 2000 -2002 bienn ium nonstatutory appropriated maintenance pools funded from Capital Construction Investment Income shall remain subject to the provisions of KRS 45.770(4)(c) and (d) with the exception of the Cabinet for Families and Children. To facilitate the transfer of five buildings from the Cabinet for Families and Children to the Finance and Administration Cabinet, it is the intent of the General Assembly that any remaining balance in any currently authorized Cabinet for Families and Children non - bond funded project be credited to the Finance and Administration Cabinet Maintenance Pool. Purchases of major items of equipment require reauthorization if a purchase order has not been executed by June 30, 2002. 2. Bond projects authorized for the first time in this section which have debt service supported by state General Fund appropriations are authorized in the first year of the biennium. Debt service has been included at the beginning of fiscal year 2003 -2004. However, the sale of any bonds to finance these projects s hall occur after August 1, 2003. 3. If any authorized capital construction or major equipment projects are canceled, any General Fund appropriated debt service for those same projects shall lapse to the credit of the General Fund. CHAPTER 156 1843 Legislative Research Commission PDF Version 4. Notwithstanding KRS 45.750 to 45.810, the General Assembly has determined that certain individual capital projects identified in this Act as eligible for funding from the Emergency Repair, Maintenance, and Replacement Fund, the Capital Construction and Equipment Purchase Co ntingency Fund, or the Deferred Maintenance Fund require a direct appropriation from the Emergency Repair, Maintenance, and Replacement Fund, the Capital Construction and Equipment Purchase Contingency Fund, or the Deferred Maintenance Fund in this Act. 5. Investment income earned from bond proceeds beyond that which is required to satisfy Internal Revenue Service arbitrage rebates and penalties and excess bond proceeds upon the completion of a bond -financed capital project may be used to pay debt service according to the Internal Revenue Service Code and accompanying regulations. Notwithstanding KRS 48.010(13)(b), 48.720, or any section of this Act, any funds appropriated but not required to pay debt service because of this fund source substitution shall be credited to the Deferred Maintenance Pool Account each year. Unneeded debt service resulting from any other circumstance shall lapse in accordance with KRS 48.010(13)(b), 48.720, and other provisions of this Act except for the following: if the fund bal ance in the Emergency Repair, Maintenance, and Replacement Fund falls below $5,000,000 in fiscal year 2002 -2003, any debt service lapse necessary to bring the fund balance to $5,000,000 in that fiscal year shall be credited to the Emergency Repair, Maintenance, and Replacement Fund. If the Emergency Repair, Maintenance, and Replacement Fund remains at $5,000,000 or above, the first $2,000,000 in fiscal year 2002 -2003 in debt service lapse shall be deposited to the General Fund Surplus Account for the purpos e of paying unbudgeted Necessary Government Expenses. No transfer to the Emergency Repair, Maintenance, and Replacement Fund, Deferred Maintenance Pool Account, or the General Fund Surplus Account shall be made based on the above provisions if the lapse from other General Fund accounts is insufficient to meet appropriations approved in other parts of this Act. 6. Investment income earned from funds credited to the Technology Trust Fund account in the Finance and Administration Cabinet shall accrue to the Capital Construction and Equipment Purchase Contingency Account established in KRS 45.770. 7. 45.818, capital construction projects at institutions of postsecondary education involving no state or Federal Funds may be authorized between regular sessions of the General Assembly if the projects receive prior approval from both the Council on Postsecondary Education and the Secretary of the Finance and Administration Cabinet, and the Capital P rojects and Bond Oversight Committee receives prior notification. 8. The Research Challenge Trust Fund -Endowment Match capital project appropriation under the Council on Postsecondary Education (L.1.c.) shall be transferred to the Research Challenge Trust Fund as established in KRS 164.7911 and 164.7917. 9. The Regional University Excellence Trust Fund -Endowment Match capital project appropriation under the Council on Postsecondary Education (L.1.d.) shall be transferred to the Regional University Excel lence Trust Fund as established in KRS 164.7911 and 164.7919. 10. Notwithstanding 2000 Ky. Acts ch. 549, Capital Projects Budget Provisions for Part II, Capital Projects, 10., pertaining to the Capital Renewal and Maintenance Pool, the matching requirement is extended until June 30, 2004. Each postsecondary education institution may access any unmatched funds allocated from the Capital Renewal and Maintenance Pool to that institution after entering into an agreement with the Council on Postsecondary Educa tion agreeing to fulfill the matching requirement by June 30, 2004. The Council on Postsecondary Education shall develop guidelines for the agreements. 11. Before any economic development bonds are issued, the proposed bond issue shall be approved by the Secretary of the Finance and Administration Cabinet and the State Property and Buildings Commission under KRS 56.440 to 56.590. In addition to the terms and conditions of KRS 154.12 -100, administration of the Economic Development Bond Program by the Secre tary of the Cabinet for Economic Development is subject to the following guideline: project selection shall be documented when presented to the Secretary of the Finance and Administration Cabinet. Included in the documentation shall be the rationale for selection and expected economic development impact. 12. Inasmuch as the identification of specific projects in a variety of areas of the state government cannot be ascertained with absolute certainty at this time, amounts are appropriated for specific purp oses to projects which are not individually identified in this Act in the following areas: Kentucky Infrastructure Authority Water and Sewer Projects Pool, Repair of State -Owned Dams, Land Acquisition, Property Demolition, Guaranteed Energy Savings projects, Purchase of Agricultural Conservation Easements (PACE), Wetland and Stream Mitigation, Phase I Tobacco Settlement Agricultural Development Initiative, Economic Development projects which shall include 1844 ACTS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY authorization for the High -Tech Construction Pool an d the High -Tech Investment Pool, Infrastructure projects, Employment Services facilities projects authorized in this part of this Act, Asbestos Abatement projects, Technology Trust Fund projects, systems, initiatives, and the Council on Postsecondary Education Fire/Life Safety/Infrastructure Agency Bond Pool and the Renovations/Infrastructure/New Construction Agency Bond Pool. Any projects estimated to cost over $400,000 and equipment estimated to cost over $100,000 shall be reported to the Capital Projects and Bond Oversight Committee. All moneys transferred to the Finance and Administration Cabinet for capital construction from any appropriations, including income from investments, shall be expended, accounted for, and otherwise treated in the same manner as funds appropriated directly to the Finance and Administration Cabinet for capital construction. 13. Notwithstanding KRS 42.560 or any other statute or provision of law to the contrary, all undisbursed funds in the Energy Assistance Trust Fund, the exp enditure authority for which expired February 19, 1998, are hereby transferred and appropriated to the Energy Efficiency in State Government Buildings Revolving Loan Fund (KRS 56.783). These funds represent receipts and accumulated interest thereon from the Stripper Well Settlement Agreement under the U.S. Department of Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation, as provided in KRS 42.560 to 42.566. These funds are appropriated as Restricted Funds in the Finance and Administration Cabinet's Capital Budget. 14. Notwithstanding KRS 154.33 -600 to 154.33 -609 or any other statute or provision of law to the contrary, all Restricted Funds appropriated by the 1998 General Assembly and added to or reauthorized by the 2000 General Assembly for the Red Fox golf course are hereby reauthorized and reallocated to a new entity entitled \"The Perry/Knott County Recreational Authority\" (PKCRA) with the following exception: the $700,000 originally appropriated by the 1998 General Assembly from the Letcher County/Single County Coal Severance tax money is hereby directed to be returned to Letcher County. The balance of Restricted Funds remaining in the heretofore entitled Red Fox/Carr Fork golf course project are authorized to be directed to a public recreational project or projects including but not limited to a public golf course at a site or sites to be determined by the Authority.
