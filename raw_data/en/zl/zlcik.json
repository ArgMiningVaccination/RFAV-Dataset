If means-centering philosophies were extreme, and if they were quite consistent, there would be no way to distinguish between an important meta-analysis and an unimportant one. There could be only technically well-prosecuted meta-analyses and technically poorly prosecuted meta-analyses. Using only methodological criteria, the most trivial research could demand as much respect as the most fruitful one.\" Modification of Maslow ( [1954](http://www.mv.helsinki.fi/home/hemila/metaanalysis/Maslow_1954_p193.pdf)) 'Meta-analysis' as a tool is quite easy to understand and apparently powerful, and this has led some people to carry out meta-analyses without making themselves familiar with the actual biology of the topic. Yusuf (1997) was worried that \"Sometimes individuals with only limited knowledge of the pharmacologic aspects of treatment, the biology of disease, or clinical circumstances that relate to the specific question may perform meta-analyses leading to an analysis with little clinical relevance.\" Bailar (1995) commented that \"A good meta-analysis requires at least as much as to do a good original article. To proceed without this level of understanding is likely to lead to serious difficulty. The 'job shop' that turns its skills to the formulaic meta-analysis of a sequence of unrelated topics is asking for trouble - and may often get it. Meta-analysis must not be routinized.\" A good example of this procedure as a mechanical endeavor detached from biology is carrying out meta-analyses on homeopathy, which is not a reasonable scientific topic for obvious reasons (Vandenbroucke 1997, 1998a; Vandenbroucke & de Craen 2001). A meta-analysis of homeopathic trials by Kleijnen et al. (1991) did not refer to any laboratory studies, although a series of papers published in Nature only a few years before would have provided relevant background in the form of laboratory experiments (Metzger & Dreskin 1988). In their meta-analysis, Kleijnen et al. (1991) commented that one homeopathic \"trial of very high quality was ... initiated by the French Ministry of Social Affairs and performed by a group consisting of regular and homeopathic researchers. After the earlier publication of several trials in which homeopathy was shown to decrease the time of recovery of bowel movements after abdominal surgery this hypothesis was retested in a rigorous trial... No differences at all were found\" between the treatment groups (Mayaux et al. 1988). This is substantially similar to the 'positive' findings in the laboratory study on homeopathy, which could not be repeated in four other laboratories (Metzger & Dreskin 1988; Seagrave 1988; Bonini et al. 1988; Hirst et al. 1993), and not even in the original laboratory when the editor of Nature came to visit (Maddox et al. 1988). Nevertheless, the number of 'good quality' homeopathy trials with 'positive results' was so large that Kleijnen et al. (1991) concluded that \"The evidence presented in this review would probably be sufficient for establishing homeopathy as a regular treatment for certain indications\" without specifying what these were. In this case, the thoughtful narrative review on this topic by Vandenroucke & de Craen (2001) is substantially more useful than the meta-analytic list of homeopathic trials with their 'quality scores' by Kleijnen et al. In another meta-analysis, Kleijnen et al. (1989; pp 38-41) focused on vitamin C and the common cold. This meta-analysis contains no reference to any papers related to the immune system studies (some 100 listed by Hemil\u00e4 1997a) or to any animal studies (see Table 2 and Appendices 2 and 3 of Hemil\u00e4 2006) that would provide important background for considering whether this is a reasonable biological issue rather than a topic for mechanical 'job shop' pooling. Neither did Chalmers (1975; pp 36-8 of Hemil\u00e4 2006) refer to any immune system studies or animal studies in his meta-analysis of vitamin C and the common cold; however, he did mention the Hume and Weyers study (1973) reporting that vitamin C in leukocytes drops sharply on the first day of the common cold (Fig. 1), and such a dramatic change in vitamin C metabolism does provide one way to rationalize the question of whether large doses of vitamin C might have therapeutic effects on colds. Pauling (1971a,b; pp 35-6 of Hemil\u00e4 2006) did not supply any direct reference to biological studies in his meta-analyses, merely referring to a book which discussed the biological background (Pauling 1970a).
