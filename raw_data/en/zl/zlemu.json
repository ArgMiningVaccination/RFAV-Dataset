Management's Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with acco unting principles gene rally accepted in the United States of America; this includes th e design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misst atement, whether due to fraud or error. Auditors' Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in ac cordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Those standard s require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consol idated financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statem ents. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal co ntrol relevant to the Company's preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated fi nancial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumst ances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An au dit also includes evaluating the ap propriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estima tes made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Opinion In ou r opinion, th e consolidated financial statem ents referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial positi on of Cincinnati Children's as of June 30, 2018 and 2017, and the consolidated result s of their operations and thei r consolidated cash flows for the years then ended in accord ance with accounting principl es generally accepted in the United States of America. Other Information Our audits were conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on th e basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole. The accompanying schedule of expenditures of federal awards as required by Title 2 U.S. Co de of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requ irements for Federal Awards, and the accompanying schedule is presented for the purposes of additional analysis and is not a required part of the basic co nsolidated financial statements. The schedule of expenditures of federal awards is the resp onsibility of management and was derived from and relates direct ly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic consolidated financial statem ents. Such in formation has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic consolidated financial statements and certain a dditional procedures, in cludin g comparing and reconciling such inf ormation directly to the underlying a ccounting and other records used to prepare the basic consolidated f inancial statements or to the basic consolidated financial statements themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. In ou r opinion, t he schedule of expenditures of f ederal awards is fairly st ated, in all material respects, in relat ion to the basic consolidated financial statements as a whole. Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated October 22, 2018 on our consideration of Cincinnati Children's internal control over financial reporting and our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that report is to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering Cincinnati Children's internal control over financial reporting and compliance.

(a) Basis of Consolidation - Childre n's Hospital Medical Center (Ci ncinnati Children's), River City Insurance Limited (River City) , CHMC Community Health Services Network LLC (TSHCH ), DTPM2 LLC, BACE, and Avondale Rentals, which are under common management, are included in the accompanying conso lidated financial statements and are collectively referred to as Cincinnati Children's. Interco mpany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Cincinnati Children's is an Ohio not-for-profit corporation pro viding pediatric healthcare services, teaching, and related research . River City is a captive insura nce company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cincinnati Childre n's. CHSN is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cincinnati Children's whose purpose is to manage primary care practices in a communit y setting. Burnet, TSHCH, DTPM2 LLC, BACE and Avondale Rentals are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Cincinnati Children's whose purpose is to hold land. Supporting Organizations - The Children's Hospital (TCH) and Co nvalescent Hospital for Children and Orphan Asylum (CHCOA) are both Ohio not-for-profit corporations that provide financial support to Cincinnati Children's . Certain endowment funds of these supporting organizations are restricted by the donors for specific operating purposes of Cincinnati Children's and are recorded asInterest in Net Assets of Supporting Organizations in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.Additionally, effective July 1, 2016, TCH amended its purpose c lause to specify the support of Cincinnati Children's as its sole purpose. After this amendmen t, Unrestricted Net Assets of TCH are recorded in Cincinnati Children's consolidated financial statem ents as an increase in Interest in Net Assets of Supporting Organizations and an increase in Temporari ly Restricted Net Assets. The impact of the amendment as of J uly 1, 2016, was to increase Interest in Net Assets of Supporting Organizations and a gain in Interest in Net Assets of Supportin g Organizations of $776,504. Receipts from such restricted endowment funds and certain other receipts that are designated by the Boards of Trustees of the supporting organizations for specific operating purposes are reflected as a component of restricted gifts and contributions in the accompan ying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Changes in Net Assets. Upon utilization in oper ations, such funds are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Changes in Net Assets as other-restricted net assets used to support operations.

On occasion, the respective Boards of Trustees of the se supporting organizations may also designate certain pledges of unrestricted principal in support of key projects at Cincinnati Children's. As of June 30, 2018, TCH had outstanding revocable pledges of $250,000. All outstanding pledges of principal support are revocable at the discretion of TCH's B oard of Trustees. As a result, such revocable pledges are not record ed as receivables in the accomp anying consolidated financial statements. The following table details transfers between Cincinnati Childr en's and Supporting Organizations in the Consolidated Statem e nt of Operations and Changes in Net Ass ets: 2018 2017 Temporarily Restricted Transfers included in Gifts, contributions and other income: Cincinnati Children's from TCH (1) $ 77,612 CHCOA 3,474 3,283 Total 81,086 62,472 Unrestricted Net Asset Transfers included in Receipts from (Transfers to) Supporting Organizations: Cincinnati Children's from TCH 3,086 3,357 (2) (101,000) (68,400) Total (97,914) (65,043) Receivables at June 30 Cincinnati from TCH (3) 10,746 10,609 Cincinnati Children's from CHCOA - 1,542 Total $ 10,746 $ 12,151 (1) $10,000 of this transfer was made in support of surgical progra ms. (2)The purpose of this transfer was to establish funds designated to support divisional activitiesand strategic priorities. (3)$10,587 of this receivable relates to an expected pay m ent upon the maturity of a life insurance policy. (4)The receivable was an irrevocable pledge in support of the renovation of the College Hill facility. (c) Concentration of Patient Account s Receivable and Revenue and Revenue Recognition - In both fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively, substantially all of net hos pital patient service revenue is derived from third-party payment programs (Medicaid, insurance companie s and various managed care agreements). - 8 -Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financ ial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively (dolla rs in thousands) The following details the percen tage of net hospital patient se rvice revenue by payer category for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017: 2018 2017 Gross Net Gross Net Commercial 1% - The following details the percentage of accounts receivable by payer category as of June 30, 2018 and 2017: 2018 2017 Commercial insurers 2% 2% Managed 1% Specialty contracts are single cas e agreements or contracts for specialty services, such as transplants. Net hospital patient service reve nue is reported at esti mated n et realizable amounts from patients, third party payers and others for services rendered and include s estimated retroactive revenue adjustments due to future audits and reviews. Retroactive adj ustments are considered in the recognition of revenue on an est imated basis in the period the related services are rendered, and such amounts are adjusted in future periods as adjustments become kn own or as years are no longer subject to such audits and reviews. Cincinnati Children's recognizes net hospital patient service r evenue associated with services provided to patients who have thi rd-party payer coverage on the basis of estimated contractual rates for services rendered. For uninsur ed patients that do not qual ify for charity care, Cincinnati Children's recognizes net hospita l patient service revenue on t he basis of its standard rates for services provided (or on the basis of discounted rates, if nego tiated or provided by financial assistance policy). On the basis of historical experience, a significant portion of Cincinnati Children's uninsured patients will be unable or unw illing to pay for the services pr ovided. Thus, Cincinnati Children's records a provision for bad debts related to uninsured patients in the period the services are provided. Revenue from government (Medicai d and Medicare) programs accoun ted for approximately 25% and 26%, respectively, of Cincinnati Children's net hospital patien t service revenue for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, r espectively. Laws and regulatio ns governing the Medicaid and Medicare programs are extremely complex and subject to interpre tation. As a result, there is at least a reasonable possibility that adjust ments could occur and recorde d estimates could change a material amount upon settlement of open co st reports. At June 30, 2018, Cincinnati Children's has settled all Medicaid cost reports through 2013 and all Medicare cost report s through 2016. - 9 -Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financ ial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively (dolla rs in thousands) The following table reconciles gross patient service revenue to net hospital patient service revenue for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017: 2018 2017 Charges at established rates on commercial contractuals (373,274) (353,663) Write-downs related to services to the underserved: Including Medicaid and governmental contractuals, charity 28,883 33,696 Net Hospital Patient Service Revenue $1,676,732 $1,602,561 Patient accounts receivable and re lated allowances for contractual adjustments and doubtful accounts are recorded on an accrual basis at estim ated collection rates to report patient accounts receivable at net realizable value. Accounts receivable are reduced by an al lowance for doubtful accounts and contractual allowances. In evaluating the collectability of accounts receivable, Cincinnati Children's performs a detail review of current accounts, analyzes its past history and identifies trends for each of its major payer sources of revenue to estimate the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts and contractual allowances. Management regularly reviews data abou t these major payer sources of revenue in evaluating the sufficiency of the allowances. For r eceivables associated with services provided to patients who have a third-party coverage, Cincinnat i Children's analyzes contractually due amounts and provides an allowa nce for contractuals (for exa mple, for expected unrecoverable amounts based on contract provisions on accounts for which the third-party payer has not yet paid, or for payers who are known to be having financial difficulties th at make the realization of amounts due unlikely). For receivables associated with self-pay patients ( which includes both patients without insurance and patients with deductible and copayment balances d ue for which third-party coverage exists for part of the bill), Cincinnati Children's records a p rovision for bad debts in the period of service on the basis of its past experience, which indicates th at many patients are unable or unwilling to pay the portion of their bill for which they are financially responsible. The difference between the standard rates (or the discounted rates if negotiated) and the amounts actually collected after all reasonable collection efforts ha ve been exhausted is charged of f against the allowance for doubtful accounts. Cincinnati Children's allowance for doubtful accounts for self- pay patients was 25.7% and 22.5% of self-pay accounts receivable at J une 30, 2018 and 2017. In add ition, Cincinnati Child ren's bad debt write-offs (before recoveries) to taled approximately $30,102 and $27,912 for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. C incinnati Children's does not maintain a material allowance for doubtful accounts from third-party payers nor does it have significant write-offs from third-party payers due to bad debt. Instead, Cincinnati Children's allowan ce is primarily comprised of contractual write-offs for third p arty payers in order to appro priately reduce receivables to net realizable value. - 10 -Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financ ial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively (dolla rs in thousands) A summary of activity in Cincinnati Children's provision for do ubtful accounts for the year ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 related to patient receivables is as fol lows: Balance at Beginning of Year Provision for Doubtful Accounts Accounts Written Off, Net of Recoveries Balance at End of Yea r Year Ended June 30, 2018 $10,662 $19,250 The Consolidated Balance Sheet also includes $64,478 and $68,50 0 of contractual reserves related to net patient receivables as of June 30, 2018 and 2017. Accounts receivable related to professional services billings i s included in Other Receivables in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. (d) Capitation Revenue - Prior to Oc tober 1, 2017, Cincinnati Child ren's had agreements with two Ohio Medicaid managed care companies , covering approximately 31,900 children to provide for reimbursement under a variabl e capitation methodology for hospi tal services. Under these two contracts, all physician and home care services were to be reim bursed based on provider fee schedules. The hospital services were reimbursed through a var iable capitation payment which represents the amount remaining after payment has been made for (a) Cincinnati Children's physician services, (b) Cincinnati Children's home care services, and (c) services provided to members outside the Cincinnati Children's network. Under delegation agreements , Health Network by Cincinnati Children's received fixed paymen ts to perform the required medi cal management, care management and care coordination functions. M edicaid managed care organiz ations retained risk for payments to providers.Effective October 1, 2017, Cinc innati Children's renegotiated b oth contracts providing variable capitation payments to change the reimbursement methodology to be consistent with traditional Medicaid reimbursement. (e) Grant Revenue and Other Revenue - Grants and contributions rest ricted for a specific operating purpose are recorded as temporarily restricted net assets and reflected in unrestricted revenues, gains, and other support when the funds are expended in accordance wit h the specifications of the grantor or donor. Contributions for capital expenditures, recorded as tem porarily restricted net assets when received, are recorded as net assets released from restrictions used for the purchase of property and equipment when expended. Unrestricted contributions and beques ts are included in other revenue when received. (f) Graduate Medical Education - Cincinnati Children's receives Federal graduate medical education funding, which has resulted in other revenue of $10,651 and $10 ,658 recognized in the accompanying consolidated financial statement s for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. - 11 -Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financ ial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively (dolla rs in thousands) (g) Tax Exempt Status - Cincinnati Children's and CHSN are recogniz ed by the Internal Revenue Service as exempt from federal income taxes under Section 501(a ) of the Internal Revenue Code as charitable organizations qualif ying under Section 501(c)(3).

During fiscal years 2018 and 2017, Cincinnati Children's recorded losses of $244 and $4,404, respectively, related to impairment of land values based on a fair market value assessment of the estimated sales price Cincinnati Children's would expect to receive upon sale of this land. (n) Costs of Borrowing - Interest incurred on borrowed funds, net of interest earned on restricted bond funds, during the period of cons truction of capital assets is c apitalized as a compone nt of the cost of acquiring those assets. In fiscal years 2018 and 2017, Cincinn ati Children's capitalized $1,138 and $420 of interest related to construction in progress, respectfu lly. Total cash paid for interest was approximately $28,836 and $27 ,029 and in fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively. Deferred bond issuance costs and original issue discounts are a mortized using the effective interest method over the period the relate d obligation is outstanding. (o) Enabling Expenses - During fiscal year 2018, Cincinnati Chi ldren's began construction of a 633,000 square foot clinical building. E nabling expenses are reimburse ments to third parties for costs incurred, such as to move existing utilities and roadwork, to a llow for construction of the building to commence. The costs do not q ualify for capitalization. (p) Temporarily Restricted Net Assets - Temporarily restricted net assets are those whose use by Cincinnati Children's has been limited by donors to a specific purpose. Temporarily restricted net assets and net assets released from donor restrictions are prim arily comprised of net assets restricted to support operations. Substan tially all of these net assets a re restricted by donors to support research, education and other advances in clinical care and prevention. The amount of temporarily restricted net assets whose use by Cincinnati Children's has been limited by donors for a specific purpose was $159,780 and $140,744 at June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Temporarily restricted net assets related to assets held in end owments at supporting organizations on Cincinnati Children's behalf are either donor restricted to sup port research at Cincinnati Children's, deferred gift programs, or life insurance contracts where the r estriction is a time restriction tied to the life expectancy of the donor or unrestricted assets that are subject to Board discretion on utilization at Cincinnati Children's. The amount of temporarily restricted n et assets held at supporting organizations was $1,175,402 and $964,279 at June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. - 13 -Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financ ial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively (dolla rs in thousands) (q) Permanently Restricted Net Assets - Permanently restric ted net assets related to assets held at Cincinnati Children's are gifts to Cincinnati Children's restri cted by the donor to be maintained in perpetuity and are recorded in Assets Limited to Use in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Permanently restricted net assets held at Cincinnati C hildren's with expendable investment income restricted by donors was $3,673 and $2,719 at June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The assets underlying such permanently restricted net assets held a t Cincinnati Children's are primarily equity securities. Permanently restricted net assets related to assets held in end owments at supporting organizations on Cincinnati Children's behalf are r estricted by the donor to be maintained in perpetuity and are recorded in Interest in Net Assets of Supporting Organizations in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as they are held by supporting organizations. T he amount of permanently restricted net assets held at supporting organizations with expendable investment income restricted by donors was $1,661,980 and $1,483,295 at June 30, 2018 and 2017, respec tively. The assets underlying Cincinnati Children's permanently restricted net assets held by supporting organizations have been invested primarily in equity securities. As of June 30, 2018 and 2017, permanently restricted net assets consisted of the following amounts with expendable investment income restricted by donors to be us ed for the following purposes: 2018 2017 Research activities $1,578,817 $1,407,224 Clinical activities 86,836 78,790 $1,665,653 $1,486,014 (r) Excess of Revenues Over Expenses - The Consolidated Statements of Operations and Changes in Net Assets include \"excess of revenu es over expenses.\" Changes in unrestricted net assets which are excluded from excess of revenues over expenses include receipts from supporting organizations, transfers to supporting organizations, pension and post-retirement health liability adjustment, and contributions of long-lived assets (including assets acquired using contributions which by donor restrictions were to be used for the purpose of acquiring such assets). (s) Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial stateme nts in conformity with accountin g principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates andassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liab ilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported am ounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. (t) New Accounting Pronouncements - In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09 \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topi c 606).\" ASU 2014-09 will elimin ate the transaction- and industry- specific revenue recognition guidance currently in place under generally accepted accounting principles and will replace it w ith a principle-based approach for determining revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 was amended by ASU 2015-14 and will be effective fo r annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017 , and early adoption is permit ted. Furthermore, ASU 2014-09 and ASU 2015-14 were further amende d in March 2016 with ASU 2016-08 \"Principal versus Agent Considerations,\" in April 2016 2016-10 \"Identifying Pe rformance Obligations and Licensing,\" ASU 2016-12 \"Narrow-Scope Impr ovements and Practical Expedients.\" The amendments have the same effective date and t ransition requirements as the new revenue standard in ASU 2014-09 a nd ASU 2015-14. Management be lieves the most significant - 14 -Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financ ial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively (dolla rs in thousands) impact of adopting the new standa rd (and all related amendments ) will be to the presentation of our income statement where the provi sion for doubtful accounts will be recorded as a direct reduction to revenues and will not be presented as a separate line item. We expect to adopt the new standard in fiscal 2019 using the full retrospective application, and we do not believe the a doption will have a significant impact on our recognition of net revenues or relate d disclosures for any period. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 \"Leases.\" ASU 201 6-02 introduces a new lessee model that brings substantially all leases onto the balance sheet. Most of the existing lessor principles are retained, but ASU 2016-02 aligns many of those principles w ith the FASB's new revenue guidance. ASU 2016-02 will be effective for fiscal years begin ning after December 15, 2018 with modified retrospective transition; early adoption permitted. In July 2018, ASU 2016-02 was amended by ASU 2018-11. The amendment a llows an optional transition met hod in which entities may recognize a cumulate-effect adjus tment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption and has the same effec tive date as ASU 2016-02. Manage ment is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-02 and ASU 2018-11 on the consolidated finan cial statements and related disclosures. In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-14 \"Presentation of Fi nancial Statements for Not-for- Profit Entities.\" The amendments focus on improving reporting in areas unique to not-for-profit financial statements. Temporar ily restricted and permanently r estricted net assets are combined into a single category called \"net assets with donor restrictions.\" D onor-restricted endowment funds that are underwater are reported in net assets with donor restrictio ns and require enhanced disclosures. Additional disclosures are require d around liquidity of financi al assets, internal transfers included in the operating subtotal, the nature of expenses, and cost alloca tion between program and support functions. Lastly, investment e xpenses netted with investment return are limited to external investment expenses and direct internal investment expenses. ASU 2016-14 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with applicatio n applied retrospectively; early adoption is permitted. Managemen t believes the most significan t impacts of adopting ASU 2016-14 will be related to presentation of net assets and expanded disc losures. In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18 \"Statement of Cas h Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash\" to add or clarify guidance on the classification and presentation of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. The ASU will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 with retrospective transition , and early adoption is permi tted. Management does not believe the impact of ASU 2016-18 will be significant to the consolidated f inancial statements. In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07 \"Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost.\" The amendment requires the service cost component of ne t benefit cost to be presented with other employee compensation costs in operating income. The other components of net benefit cost will be reported separately out side of operations. The ASU wil l be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 , with application applied ret rospectively; early adoption is permitted. Management does not b elieve the impact of ASU 2017- 07 will be significant to the consolidated financial statements. In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-08 \"Not-for-Profit Entit ies (Topic 958): Clarifying the Scope and the Accounting Guidance for Contributions Received an d Contributions Made.\" The amendment clarifies and enhances current guidance about whether a transfer of assets is a contribution or an exchange tra nsaction. In additi on, the amen dment clarifies how an entity - 15 -Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financ ial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively (dolla rs in thousands) determines whether a resource provider is participating in an e xchange transaction and improves the framework for determining whether a contribution is conditional or unconditional, and for distinguishing a donor-imposed condition from a donor-imposed r estriction. The ASU will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 wi th modified prospective application for agreements not completed as of the effective date or entere d into after the effective date, and early adoption is permitted. The impact of ASU 2018-08 is not signif icant to the consolidated financial statements, and management has elected to adopt the ASU as of J uly 1, 2018. (2) Fair Value Measurements - Cincinnati Children's accounts for its assets and liabilities u nder ASC 820 \"Fair Value Measurements\". As defined in ASC 820, fair value is the price that would be recei ved to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transacti on between market participants at the measurement date. In order to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and re lated disclosures, ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techn iques used to measure fair value into three broad levels, which are described below: Level 1: Quoted Prices (unadjusted) in active markets for iden tical assets or liabilities that are accessible at the measurement date for assets and liabilities. The fair valu e hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs. Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly or indirectly. These include quot ed prices for identical o r similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, that is, markets in which there are a few transactions for the asset or liability, the prices are not current, or price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers, or in which little information is released publicly and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Level 3: Unobservable inputs, d eveloped using Cincinnati Child ren's estimates and assumptions, which reflect those that the market participants would use. Such inp uts are used when little or no market data is available. The fair value hierarchy gives the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs. Determining where an asset or liability falls within the hierar chy depends on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole. In deter mining fair value, Cincinnati Children's utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observab le inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible and considers counte rparty credit risk in the assessment of fair value. - 16 -Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financ ial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively (dolla rs in thousands) The table below includes the major categorization for debt and equity securities on the basis of the nature and risk of the investments at June 30, 2018. Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Marketable Securities : U.S. Governmen t and agency securities $ - $349,687 $ - $349,687 Forei gn bonds - 44,321 - 3,133 As To Use: Mone y market mutual funds 3,576 - - 3,576 Common stoc k 6,056 - - 6,056 9,632 - - 9,632 Deferred Compensation Plans (included in Other Long-term Assets): Common stoc k 5,063 - - 5,063 Mutual Funds:Mone y Marke t 235 - - 235 Equit y 1,522 - - 1,522 International Equit y 829 - - 829 Bond 848 - - 848 Lifec ycle 4,365 - - 4,365 Real Estate 3 - - 3 Variable Annuities: Bond - 22 - 22 Equit y - 95 - 95 International Equit y - 2 1 - 2 1 Mone y Marke t - 6 - 6 Guarantee d Insurance Contrac t - - 3,076 3,076 12,865 144 3,076 16,085 Total assets value hierarch y 117,698 724,981 3,076 845,665 Investments measured at net asset value1: Full Discretion Fixed Income 39,569 Fixed Income Investment Partnership 19,976 High yield corporate obligations 166 Total assets at fair value $117,698 $724,891 $ 3,076 $905,376 1 Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the n et asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedien t have not been categori zed in the fair value hierarchy.

The fair value amounts presented in this table are intended to permit reconciliation of the f air value hierarchy to the amounts prese nted in the balance sheet. - 18 -Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financ ial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively (dolla rs in thousands) The valuation methods described b elow may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furt hermore, although management believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of cer tain financial instruments could result in different fair value measurem ent at the reporting date. Cincinnati Children's uses quoted market prices in active marke ts to determine the fair value of common stock and mutual funds; such items are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. Cincinnati Children's primarily bases fair value for investment s in fixed income securities, including U.S. government securities, municipal bonds and corporate obligation s on a calculation using interest rate curves and credit spreads applied to the terms of the debt instrument (maturity and coupon interest rate) and considers the counterparty cred it rating. Such items are class ified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Cincinnati Children's investment in High Yield Corporate Obligations is an investment in a limited liability company whose investment objective is to achieve superior fixed income returns on invested funds through exposure to higher quality, less volatile, high yield debt securities. As set forth in the LLC agreement, the LLC will dissolve on March 29, 2040, but may dissolve earlier under certain conditions. Any Investing Member may elect to withdraw, in whole or in part from the LLC on the last business day of any month or at such other date, as determined by the manager. The High Yield Corporate Obligations is measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient. Cincinnati Children's investment in Full Discretion Fixed Incom e is an investment in a limited liability company whose investment objective is to invest in marketable a nd non-marketable securities with issue and industry diversification. As set forth in the LLC agreemen t, the LLC will dissolve on May 22, 2047, but may dissolve earlier under certain conditions. Any Investing Member may elect to withdraw, in whole or in part from the LLC if the Member notifies of intent to wit hdraw sixty calendar days in advance and if the Member withdraw will not adversely affect the Company. The Full Discretion Fixed Income is measured at fair value using the net asset value per share prac tical expedient. Cincinnati Children's is invested in a Fixed Income investment partnership measured at net asset value. The investment objective is to provide for a balance of preservation of assets and growth in principle. The investment in an investment partnership is gener ally associated with liquidation restrictions that are semi-monthly. As set for th in the participation agree ment, Cincinnati Children's or the investment advisor may terminate the agreement without penalty upon thirty days' written notice to either party. The Corporation has $19,976 of investments in a fund with semi-mont hly liquidity. The guaranteed insurance contract is recorded based on discounted cash flows, which is an approximation of fair value. Cincinnati Children's Level 3 investment is primarily in a guar anteed insurance contract. This investment is classified as Level 3 based on time restrictions for redempt ion. - 19 -Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financ ial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively (dolla rs in thousands) The following is a reconciliation of the roll forward of the fa ir value measurements using significant unobservable inputs: 2018 2017 Balance Beginning of Yea r $2,753 $2,321 Purchases 905 1,250 Unrealized gains 49 40 Sales (631) (858) Balance at June 30, $3,076 $2,753 The amount of total gains for the period included in changes in net assets attributable to the change in unrealized gains or losses related to assets still held at June 30, $49 $40 Cincinnati Children's policy is to recognize transfers in and o ut as of the actual date of the event or change in circumstances that caused th e transfer. For the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, there were no material transfers in or out of Levels 1, 2 or 3. (3) Losses on the Provision of Uncompensated Care - In accordance with its mission and purpose, Cincinnati Children 's maintains a policy of pro viding medically necessary services to ped iatric patients within its p rimary service area regardless of ability to pay. This primary service area has been defined to include the four counties in Ohio, three counties in Kentucky and one county in Indiana that geographically surround Cincinna ti. Under certain circumstances, Cincinnati Children's accepts patients from outside the primary service ar ea regardless of their ability to pay. Cincinnati Children's defines indigent patient care as services rendered to patients whose families' annual income or net worth falls below certain minimum standards. As such, losses absorbed by Cincinnati Children's in rendering services to patients who are covered un der governmental programs which are designed to aid low income families (primarily the Medicaid pro gram) are considered indigent patient care. - 20 -Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financ ial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively (dolla rs in thousands) The following information summarizes uncompensated care provide d during the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017: 2018 CHARGES Hospital Physician Total Charges under Medicaid and other entitlement programs $1,437,141 $342,588 $1,779,729 Charity care not eligible for Medicaid ch arges 28,345 charges $1,482,408 $351,937 $1,834,345 COSTS/LOSSES ompensated care $ 643,742 $134, 283 $ 778,025 Reimbursement from Medicaid programs (436,829) (40,787) (477,616) Losses on the provision of uncompensated care (206,913) (93,496 ) (300,409) Funds received from HCAP and tax levy 33,348 - 33,348 Losses on provision of uncompensated care net of HCAP and tax levy $ (173,565) $ (93,496) $ (267,061) 2017 CHARGES Hospital Physician Total Charges under Medicaid and other entitlement programs $1,338,432 $298,360 $1,636,792 Charity care not eligible for Medicaid assistance, at established charges 24,311 1,792 26,103 Other uncollectible self-pay, at established charges charges $1,377,506 $307,056 $1,684,562 COSTS/LOSSES ompensated care $ 604,495 $126, 507 $ 731,002 Reimbursement from Medicaid programs (426,738) (35,678) (462,416) Losses on the provision of uncompensated care (177,757) (90,829 ) (268,586) Funds received from HCAP and tax levy 38,396 - 38,396 Losses on provision of uncompensated care net of HCAP and tax levy $ (139,361) $ (90,829) $ (230,190) The 2018 and 2017 cost amounts reflected in the tables above ar e calculated using cost to charge ratios calculated from prior year cost reports because the current yea r cost report is not yet available. Management does not believe that the difference in the cost rep ort year would have a material impact on the amounts calculated. - 21 -Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financ ial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively (dolla rs in thousands) (4) Funds in Trust - Cincinnati Children's has certain funds, which are invested and held in trust for various specified purposes.

(B)Cincinnati Children's has established a trust fund for the pa y ment of claims related to certain self- insured employee health care and other programs. (C)Cincinnati Children's maintained an escrow fund with a bank as part of the arrangement with an Ohio Medicaid Managed Care Com pany under its division called Health Network to cover estimated incurred but not reported claims for Cincinnati Children's providers, home care andmental health services as well as non-Cincinnati Children's pro viders. The fund was liquidated in fiscal year 2018 as part of the re negotiation of the variable c apitation agreements. (D)Cincinnati Children's maintains bond interest escrow funds as r equired under the terms of the related bond indentures to hold interest payments until the req uired payment dates to bondholders.

The self-insured ret ention for the claims that are currently asserted is $10,000 ($25,000 in aggregate). Cincinnati Children's annua lly purchases excess healthcare professional liability insurance on a claims m ade basis at varying levels. The actuarial present value of expected costs (including incurr ed, but not reported claims) for the healthcare professional liability program of $41,062 and $40,373 for 2018 and 2017, respectively, has been accrued in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Accrued healthca re professional liability losses have been discounted at a rate of 4% at June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectiv ely. The costs of Cincinnati Children's healthcare professional liability program, including premiums p aid for excess re-insurance, legal fees, settlements, judgments, and other administrative costs are incl uded in Supplies, Drugs and Other in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Changes in Net Assets. On an ongoing basis, management reviews the status of all healthcare professional liability claims, as well as legal proceedings,and, based upon consultation w ith a professional actuary, adjus ts the accrued losses funding levels to reflect its best estimate of the present value of expected costs for th e healthcare professional liability claims. Healthcare professional liabilit y expense amount ed to $23,747 a nd $6,874 for fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively. (7) Capital Lease Obligations - Cincinnati Children's leases certain equipment under capital le ases. The aggregate future minimum lease payments total $8,924, with $2,388 due in fiscal year 2019.

SCOPE OF AUDIT All federal grant operations of Cincinnati Children's are included in the scope of Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance) . Single audits under the Uniform Guidance are performed in accordance with the provisions of the Office of Management an d Budget (OMB)'s Compliance Supplement f or Single Audits of Higher Learning Institutions and other Non-Prof it Institutions (the \"Compliance Supplement\"). The Dep artment of Health and Human Services has been designated as Cincinnati Children's cog nizant agency for the Single audit. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESBasis of Presentation \u2014 The accompanying Supplemental S chedule of Expen ditures of Federal Awards (the \"Schedule\") includes the federal grant activity of Cincinnati C hildren's under programs of the federal government for the year ended June 30, 2018, and is presented o n the accrual basis of accounting. This is consistent with the basis of acco unting used in the preparation of the basic consolidated financial statements. The information in this Schedule is presented in accordance wit h the requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Guidance . Because the Schedule presents only a selected portion of the operations of Cincinnati Children's, it is not intended to and does not present the financial position, changes in net assets or cash flows of Ci ncinnati Children's. Cincinnati C hildren's did not elect to use the 10% de minimis indirect cost rate as allowed under the Uniform Guidanc e. Net Asset Balances \u2014 Negative amounts represent grants with deficit balances whic h were closed during fiscal 2018. ****** - 60 -REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OV ER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND ON COMPLIANCE AND OTHER MATTERS BASED ON AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT To the Board of Trustees of Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Cincinnati, Ohio We have audited, in accordance with the au diting standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller Gener al of the United States, the consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2018, and the related conso lidated statements of operations and changes in net assets and of cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements which collectively comprise Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates (\"Cincinnati Children's\") basic consolidated financial statements and have issued our repo rt thereon dated October 22, 2018. Internal Control over Financial Reporting In planning and performing our audit of the consolidated financial statements, we considered Cincinnati Children's internal control over financial reporting (internal control) to determine the audit procedures that are approp riate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Cincinnati Children's internal control. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of Cincinnati Children's internal control. A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or op eration of a control does not allow management or employees, in the norm al course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and co rrect, misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of defi ciencies, in internal control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a mate rial misstatement of th e entity's financial statements will not be prev ented, or detected and corre cted on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses or signif icant deficiencies. Give n these limitations, during our audit we did not identi fy any deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses. Howe ver, material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified. Compliance and Other Matters As part of obtaining reasonable assurance ab out whether Cincinnati Children's consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the determination of financial statement amounts. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our audit, and accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. The results of our te sts disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards . Purpose of this Report The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of Cincinnati Children's internal control or on compliance. This report is an integral part of an audit pe rformed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering Cincinnati Children's internal control and compliance. Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any other purpose. October 22, 2018 - 62 - REPORT ON COMPLIANCE FOR EACH MAJOR FEDERAL PROGRAM; REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER COMPLIANCE; AND REPORT ON THE SCHEDULE OF EXPENDITURES OF FEDERAL AWARDS REQUIRED BY THE UNIFORM GUIDANCE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT To the Board of Trustees Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Cincinnati, Ohio Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program We have audited Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates (\"Cincinnati Children's\") compliance with the types of compliance requir ements described in the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Compliance Su pplement that could have a direct and material effect on each of Cincinnati Childre n's major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2018. Cincinnati Children's major federal programs are identified in the summary of auditor's results section of the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs. Management's Responsibility Management is responsible for compliance with federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of its federal awards applicable to its federal programs. Auditor's Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on compliance for each of Cincinnati Children's major federal programs based on our audit of the types of compliance requirements referred to above. We conducte d our audit of compliance in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America; the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards , issued by the Comptroller General of the United St ates; and the audit requir ements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principals, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance). Thos e standards and the Uniform Guidance require that we plan and perform the audit to obta in reasonable assurance about whether noncompliance with the types of comp liance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and materi al effect on a major federa l program occurred. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence about Cincinnati Children's compliance with those requirements and performi ng such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion on compliance for each major federal program. However, our audit does not provide a legal determination of Cincinnati Children's compliance. Opinion on Each Major Federal Program In our opinion, Cincinnati Children's complied, in all material respects, with the types of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on each of its major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2018. Report on Internal Control over Compliance Management of Cincinnati Children's is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over compliance with the ty pes of compliance requirements referred to above. In planning and performing our audit of compliance, we considered Cincinnati Children's internal control over compliance with the types of requirements that could have a direct and material effect on each major federal program to determine the auditing procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing an opinion on compliance for each major federal program and to test and report on internal control over compliance in accordance with the Uniform Guidance, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of intern al control over compliance. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of Cincinnati Children's internal control over compliance. A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over compliance does not allow manageme nt or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program on a timely basis. A material weakness in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or combinatio n of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such that there is a reasonable possibility that material noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program will not be prevented, or detected and co rrected, on a timely basis. A significant deficiency in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program that is less severe than a material weakness in internal control over compliance, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. Our consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over compliance that mi ght be material weak nesses or significant deficiencies. We did not identify any deficiencies in internal control over compliance that we consider to be material weak nesses. However, material weak nesses may exist that have not been identified. The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over complia nce and the results of that testing based on the requirements of the Uniform Guidance. Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other purpose. Report on Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards Required by the Uniform Guidance We have audited the consolidated financial stat ements of Cincinnati Children's as of and for the year ended June 30, 2018, and have issued our report thereon dated October 22, 2018, which contained an unmodified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the consolidated financial statements as a whole. The accompanying schedule of expenditures of federal awards is - 64 -presented for purposes of additi onal analysis as required by the Uniform Guidance and is not a required part of the consolidated financial statements. Such information is the responsibility of management and was derived fr om and relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. The information has been subjected to the auditi ng procedures applied in the audit of the consolidated financial statements and certai n additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the consolidated financial st atements or to the consolidated financial statements themselves, and ot her additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. In our opinion, the schedule of expenditure of federal awards is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the consolidated financial statements as a whole.
