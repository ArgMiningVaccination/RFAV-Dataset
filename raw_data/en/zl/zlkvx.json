It is a program designed to provide services in the home and/or community for adults and children who would otherwise require nursing facility placement. If you or someone in your family needs nursing facility care or personal care in the home and cannot afford the cost, you may be eligible to have this service covered by Medicaid. For financial eligibility contact your local social services (DSS) for an application or apply for Medicaid online. Adult Screenings Inquiries and requests for adult screenings should be directed to the Department of Social Services (DSS) in your county. A DSS intake worker will collect information concerning the request. A nurse from the local Health Department and an adult service worker from the local DSS office will then schedule a visit with the patient at their home to determine if they meet Medicaid's nursing facility criteria then this information is given to the local Health Department director. A decision is made as to whether or not nursing facility placement or personal care services in the home is the appropriate level of care to meet the patient's needs. The preadmission screening process may also be completed by a hospital screening committee if the person is in an acute care hospital at the time the placement is needed.
