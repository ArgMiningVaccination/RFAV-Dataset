A number of these neutraceuticals interact with prescription drugs and may have adverse effects. Objective: This study explored the extent to which chiropractic patients are likely to inform their chiropractic practitioner of their medication practices. Method: A case study that included patients attending 21 chiropractic clinics in 5 states and the Australian Capital Territory was undertaken. Seven hundred fifty-eight patients provided information on their nutritional and herbal supplementation practices. Data were collected using a questionnaire that inquired about general life-style and sought particular information about self-initiated and professionally recommended medication practices. A list of medications that could influence coagulation was provided. Patients were specifically requested to indicate whether they had informed their chiropractor about any of the medications, herbs, or nutrients they were taking. Results: More than 1 in 3 of the chiropractic patients in this study were taking, either on the advice of a health professional or, more often, on their own initiative, a nutritional supplement and/or herb. Yet, chiropractors were only occasionally informed about the medication practices of their patients. Conclusion: In view of the potential health risks and drug interactions, chiropractors should routinely inquire whether their patients are taking herbs or nutritional supplements.
