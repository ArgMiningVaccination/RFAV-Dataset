Acupuncture is one treatment modality in a system of medicine known as Oriental Medicine or the term we prefer, East Asian Medicine. The process involves placing fine hair-like filaments at specific points on the body to move vital energy, or Qi, that flows throughout a person's body in specific patterns. When this flow is blocked or disrupted, illness and dysfunction results. The treatment is designed to promote and restore the balance of energy. From its inception in China more than 3,000 years ago, east asian medicine has been used traditionally to prevent, diagnose and treat disease, as well as to improve general health. The World Health Organization and the National Institute of Health recognize it as an effective treatment for many health conditions. At Chiropractic Lifestyle Center we are very proud to provide this recognized and respected treatment. Did you know...Acupuncture directly benefits a person's bodily health by increasing circulation, reducing swelling, releasing endorphins, and stimulating the limbic system. As a result, a wide variety of conditions are treated, from emotional disorders (anxiety, depression) to digestive complaints (nausea, vomiting, irritable bowel syndrome). Meet our acupuncturist Linda McManus, MS, EAMP is a Licensed Acupuncturist/East Asian Medical Practitioner and a graduate of Bastyr University and has been practicing in Kitsap County since 2001. Born and raised in Southern California, I first visited Washington state at the age of 9 on a road trip with my grandparents. To this day, I remember feeling in awe of the beauty and power here and a deep sense that I would return. In1995 I moved here with my husband to be near his family and have felt at home in the Pacific Northwest ever since. My own experiences as a child and young adult with conventional healthcare, its limits and the solutions my family drew on launched my own explorations into health and wellness. When I returned to college in my 30's I found the study of Chinese Medicine to be a natural fit. As a primary component of Traditional Chinese Medicine, acupuncture uses the insertion of very thin filiform needles into specific sites on the body to quiet and regulate the nervous and endocrine systems, improve blood circulation, promote tissue healing and manage inflammation. Used for centuries, acupuncture is proven effective in the treatment of women's health concerns, gastrointestinal disorders, migraines and headaches, back pain and neck pain, arthritis, stress, anxiety and depression, and many others. Traditional Chinese Medicine is founded on the interconnectedness of everything, so I hold that healing begins with the individual and ripples outwards to affect everything in our lives: our family, our community, and beyond. My goal is to meet you right where you are on your own health journey. The human body has its own powerful wisdom; let acupuncture help you engage that wisdom. "}
