While some trends are all hype, detoxing has definitely earned its spotlight. Before industrialization, humans had the privilege of living in relatively clean environments. There were no artificial chemicals in the forms of pesticides, solvents, synthetic additives and so on. Unfortunately, we modern humans can't get away from these things. BUT we can remediate their harm so that we can live a vibrant and healthy life. Here's where detoxing comes in. Think of yourself as a cup. The more toxins you're exposed to the more your cup fills. When it is overflowing, inflammation and disease sets in. The goal is to lower the toxin load in the cup enough to allow your body's self healing mechanisms to keep you feeling your best. Why Deep Detoxing? In addition to environmental toxins, modernized living allows for a whole slew of other body burdens. Mold from water damaged buildings, candida overgrowth from high sugar and refined carbohydrate consumption, parasites from food and the environment, microbiome imbalances from the Standard American Diet, and chronic viruses from overburdened immune systems. Realistically, we can never completely empty our toxin cups, but the deeper we detox, the more crud we clear from the body. How It's Done Deep detoxing is done in phases, systematically opening up the emunctories to release the crud. Emunctories are your detox pathways. These include the colon, liver, kidneys, skin, and lungs. When these function optimally, toxins may come into the body, but they'll also drain right out. When there's some sort of backup, the whole system suffers. Another great analogy is to think of your body as a funnel. If you pour toxins in too quickly, the funnel overflows. If there's a clog anywhere in the funnel, no matter how little is poured in, the funnel will overflow. Ideally, our bodies function like the funnel on the left. But symptoms occur when we function like the funnel on the right, when toxins overflow from the emunctories and into the body. When the colon is backed up, the liver and bile ducts become congested. From here, toxins enter the bloodstream and get excreted through the skin, kidneys and lungs. Some toxins are meant to be excreted this way, through sweat, urine and breath. But too many of them result in conditions like eczema or acne, kidney diseases, or respiratory illnesses. From here, the lymphatic system can get congested as well. The lymphatic vessels are where your white blood cells of your immune system live. If there's congestion here, your immune cells can't get around your body to fight infection and heal your tissues. Then, the toxins accumulate all the way into your organs, tissues and cells, causing that oh-so infamous inflammation, which is at the root of all disease. The Method To The Madness The detox protocols, designed by CellCore, are designed to be gentle, yet thorough. In phase 1, you open up the liver and the kidney pathways, to allow congestion to clear and toxins to begin to make their way out of the body. Importantly, you also support your mitochondria, the powerhouses of your cells. Many environmental toxins can cause the mitochondria to burn out. When this happens, the cells can't make enough energy to fuel you through your day. Without energy, the cells can't initiate detoxification processes. This is why your mitochondria are supported from the very start. In phase 2, we bring the gut microbiome back into balance, supporting digestion and optimal nutrient absorption. In phase 3, we support your immune system, so that it can properly calm down the toxic inflammatory storm. In phase 4, we clear out all the environmental toxins, heavy metals, and radioactive elements which have built up in the body causing havoc. And, if necessary, in phase 5 we go even deeper into the immune system, fighting off chronic viruses that are taxing the body. Ready To Detox?? OK, if you've read this far, you're probably intrigued! Clearing out all the crud sounds like a great idea. Doing it in a systematic way, so that your funnel doesn't overflow anywhere in the process, sounds like the best way it could be done! So, what's the catch? To effectively do this deep detox, you get to choose between *drum roll please* a four or a nine month long protocol. Now, before you start imagining what life would be like without ice cream for that long, we have some good news. The supplements in this protocol do the heavy lifting. Each month you're on a new set of supplements, aimed at clearing out more layers of crud. Yes, clean eating will facilitate the process. The less you pour into the funnel, the less that needs to drain. But on this detox, rigid eating is not required, and moderation is your best friend. So, if you're ready to embark upon the deepest inner spring cleaning you've ever done, make an appointment with Dr. Lisa at Mountain River Naturopathic Clinic. She'll help you determine which protocol is right for you, answer all of your questions, recommend additional support or testing that might benefit your detoxifying journey, and be your guide throughout the entire process. 0 Comments Leave a Reply. | | Dr. Justin Pollack, Dr. Kim Nearpass, Dr. Lisa Pomerantz.
