Homeopathy was introduced in 1789 by Dr. Samuel Hahnemann, a German doctor and chemist. The word \"homeopathy\" is derived from two Greek words that mean \"similar suffering.\" It is based on the pharmaceutical principle called the law of similars. Homeopathic medicine embraces a holistic, natural approach to the treatment of the sick. Homeopathy is holistic because it treats the person as a whole, rather than focusing on a diseased part or a labeled sickness. Homeopathy is natural because its remedies are produced from natural sources, whether vegetable, mineral, or animal in nature. Some commonly known homeopathic remedies that you may know are, St. John's Wort, chamomile, calcium carbonate and potassium.
