At this time, filgrastim -sndz has not applied for the interchangeable designation from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). When tbo- filgrastim was approved, a regulatory pathway for biosimilar drugs had not yet been established in the United States and tbo- filgrastim was filed under its own Biologic License Application. 9 Only one GM- CSF is currently available, sargramostim (Leukine\u00ae). These agents are FDA -approved for a variety of conditions relating to neutropenia or for the collection of hematopoietic progenitor cells by leukapheresis.1- 5 The G -CSFs are generally used in patients with cancer to reduce the incidence of adverse events associated with chemotherapy, such as febrile neutropenia, infections and delayed neutrophil recovery time. Neutrophils are the body's defense system against infection and play a key role in the process of acute inflammation. 10 Chemotherapy and radiation can affect neutrophil function as well as decrease the production of neutrophils in the bone marrow. When the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) falls below 1,500 cells/L, this is defined as neutropenia. Patients who have severe neutropenia (ANC <500 cells/L) are at high risk for infection. 10 Endogenous G -CSF is a growth factor produced by monocytes, fibroblasts and endothelial cells that acts upon the bone marrow to increase the production of neutrophils. In addition to increasing neutrophil production, G -CSF also enhances phagocytic and pegfilgrastim are by recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) technology via the insertion of the human G -CSF gene into Escherichia coli (E coli ) bacteria.1-3,5 Pegfilgrastim, a long- acting formulation of filgrastim, is produced by conjugating filgrastim with polyethylene glycol, thereby increasing the molecular weight and delaying kidney excretion.3 GM-CSF is primarily used to accelerate myeloid recovery in oncology patients following myelosuppressive treatment regimens. Endogenous macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells.6 In addition to increasing the production of neutrophils, GM- CSF also increases other white blood cells including monocytes, macrophages and eosinophils in the bone marrow as well as promoting their function. Like the G -CSFs, sar gramostim is also produced utilizing recombinant DNA technology; however it is derived in yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae) expression system rather than from E coli bacteria .4 Table 1.

Evidence- based Medicine \u00b7 The safety and efficacy of the granulocyte and granulocyte- macrophage colony stimulating factors have been evaluated in several clinical trials; however, there are few trials that compare G -CSFs to GM-CSFs. Agents were shown to be safe and effective for FDA -approved indications.18-53 \u00b7 Tbo-filgrastim was evaluated in a single multi -center, placebo- and active- controlled, randomized control trial that evaluated patients with breast cancer. Patients received tbo- filgrastim, filgrastim, or placebo for cycle one. For cycle two to four, patients that received placebo were switched to tbo- filgrastim. Doses were 5g/kg daily for both active treatment groups for all cycles. The primary efficacy endpoint was duration of severe neutropenia in cycle one. When compared to placebo, tbo-Therapeutic Class Overview : Colony Stimulating Factors Page 3 of 5 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 2/29/2016 filgrastim was provided a statistically significant improvement in duration of severe neutropenia (no P value reported). When compared to filgrastim, tbo- filgrastim was considered equivalent with a least square mean difference of 0.028 (95% CI, -0.262 to 0.325). Secondary endpoints showed no differences between tbo- filgrastim and filgrastim during any cycle or overall.38 Key Points within the Medication Class \u00b7 Base d on current guidelines: o It is important to prevent and limit the duration of febrile neutropenia.11,12 o Recommend primary prophylaxis with a CSF when the risk of febrile neutropenia is >20%. o Recommend that the therapeutic use of a CSF be considered only when a patient with febrile neutropenia is at high risk of infection- related complications based on prognostic factors. o There is currently no general consensus among the guidelines regarding the specific CSFs within the class. o The NCCN states that when choosing an agent for the treatment of prophylaxis of febrile neutropenia, filgrastim and pegfilgrastim are considered to have stronger data to support their use compared to sargramostim. 11,13 o The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer recommends the use of filgrastim and pegfilgrastim while stating that there is some evidence showing G -CSF and GM-CSF are comparable in efficacy. 14 o The ASCO state that due to the lack of information, no recommendation can be made with regards to the equivalenc y of the two G -CSFs. 12 \u00b7 Other Key Facts: o Due to the pathway taken, tbo- filgrastim does not share all of the same indications as filgrastim and these two products are not interchangeable. It is important to note that although filgrastim -sndz is a biosimilar product, and it was approved with all the same indications as filgrastim at the time, filgrastim has since received FDA -approval for an additional indication that filgrastim -sndz does not have, to increase survival in patients with acute exposure to myelo suppressive doses of radiation. 1-3 o Differences among dosing schedules also exist between the agents. Pegfilgrastim is administered at a fixed dose (6 mg subcutaneously once per chemotherapy cycle), while filgrastim, filgrastim and sargramostim are dosed patient's body weight and are administered daily. 1-5 References 1.

Page 1 of 59 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 2/29/201 6 Therapeutic Class Review Colony Stimulating Factors Overview/Summary This review will focus on the granulocyte colony stimulating factors (G -CSFs) and granulocyte- macrophage colony stimulating factors (GM- CSFs).1-5 Colony factors (CSFs) fall under the naturally occurring glycoprotein cytokines, one of the main groups of immunomodulators.6 In general, these proteins are vital to the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells.6-8 The G - CSFs commercially available human G -CSF as filgrastim, only filgrastim -sndz is considered a biosimilar drug as it was approved through the biosimilar pathway.

It is important to note that although filgrastim -sndz is a biosimilar product, and it was approved with all the same indications as filgrastim at the time, filgrastim has since received FDA- approval for an additional indication that filgrastim -sndz does not have, to increase survival in patients with acute exposure to myelosuppressive doses of radiation. 1-3 A complete list of indications for each agent can be found in Table 2. Differences among dosing schedules also exist between the agents. Pegfilgrastim is administered at a fixed dose (6 mg subcutaneously once per chemotherapy cycle), while patient's body weight and are administered daily. 1-5 The G -CSFs are generally used in patients with cancer to reduce the incidence of adverse events associated with chemotherapy, such as febrile neutropenia, infections and delayed neutrophil recovery time.

Similarly, both guidelines recommend primary prophylaxis with a CSF when the risk of febrile neutropenia is >20%. In addition, they recommend that the therapeutic use of a CSF be considered only when a patient with febrile neutropenia is at high risk of infection- related complications based on prognostic factors. 11,12 There is currently no general consensus among the guidelines regarding the specific CSFs within the class. The NCCN states that when choosing an agent for the treatment of prophylaxis of febrile neutropenia, filgrastim and pegfilgrastim are considered to have stronger data to support their use compared to sargramostim. 11,13 The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer recommends the use of filgrastim and pegfilgrastim while stating that there is some evidence showing G -CSF and GM- CSF are comparable in efficacy.14 The ASCO state that due to the lack of information, no recommendation can be made with regards to the equivalency of the two G -CSFs.12 Medications Table 1.

Safety and efficacy has not been established in patients <55 years of age. Although not FDA approved, filgrastim has been used for the treatment of graft failure after bone marrow transplantation, neutropenia associated with myelodysplastic syndrome, hairy cell leukemia, aplastic anemia, acquired immune deficiency syndrome and zidovudine- and other drug- induced neutropenias. Pegfilgrastim has been used for peripheral blood stem cell leukapheresis prior to autologous stem cell transplantation. Sargramostim has also been used for non- FDA approved indications. It has been most commonly used to treat Crohn's disease. Other uses of sargramostim include the treatment of m elanoma, neutropenia associated with myelodyspl astic syndrome or mucositis, pulmonary sepsis and neutropenia the newborn, stomatitis, zidovudine- and other drug- induced neutropenia and wound healing. Sargramostim has also been used as a vaccine adjuvant and an adjunct to high- dose chemotherapy. 15,16 Pharmacokinetics Table 3.

In Almenar et al, a multicenter, Therapeutic Class Review: colony stimulating factors Page 4 of 59 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 2/29/201 6 retrospective, observational trial, pegfilgrastim was associated with fewer episodes of febrile neutropenia compared to filgrastim (10.7 vs 24.3%, respectively; P value not reported) as well as fewer hospitalizations for febrile neutropenia (9.3 vs 19.8%, respectively; P value not reported). 18 Results from Weycker et al also showed the risk of hospitalization for febrile neutropenia or infection was lower with pegfilgrastim compared to filgrastim (odds ratio, 0.64; 95% single- dose pegfilgrastim to daily filgrastim in reducing neutropenia in 310 patients who received four cycles of myelosuppressive chemotherapy for high- risk breast cancer. There were no significant differences between treat ment groups in the duration of severe neutropenia and the depth of ANC nadir in all cycles. Overall, the incidence of febrile neutropenia was less in the pegfilgrastim group than in the filgrastim group (9 vs 18%; P=0.029). The difference in the mean duration of severe neutropenia between the pegfilgrastim and filgrastim treatment groups was less than one day. Adverse event profiles in the pegfilgrastim and filgrastim groups were similar. A single injection of pegfilgrastim per cycle was as safe and effecti ve as daily injections of filgrastim in reducing neutropenia and its complications in patients who received four cycles of chemotherapy. 21 One randomized, double- blind, multicenter trial compared filgrastim and sargramostim in patients with chemotherapy -induced febrile neutropenia (ANC 500 cells/L). Patients were given daily subcutaneous injections of either agent until ANC levels reached 1,500 cells/L. Overall, the mean number of days patients received filgrastim (4.60\u00b10.14 days) was significantly shorter than sargramostim (5.70\u00b10.23 days; P=0.0001). There was no significant difference among the treatment groups in the mean number of days to reach an ANC 500 cells/L (filgrastim, 3.60\u00b10.16 vs sargramostim, 3.30\u00b10.16; P=0.32); however, the mean number of days to reach an ANC 1,000 and 1,500 cells/L was significantly lower in the filgrastim group (4.50\u00b10.13 and 4.60\u00b10.14, respectively) compared to (5.10\u00b10.22 5.70\u00b10.23, respectively; P=0.009 and P=0.0001, respectively). In r egards to the other endpoints reported, patients in the sargramostim group had fewer hospitalizations with febrile neutropenia or intravenous (IV) antibiotics ( P=0.46), shorter mean length of hospitalization ( P=0.58) and shorter mean duration of fever ( P=0.14) compared to patients in the filgrastim group; however, these endpoints did not reach statistical significance. Overall the agents were well tolerated and had comparable efficacy and tolerability in the treatment of standard- dose chemotherapy -induced myelosuppression in community practic e.22 blind, multicenter trial comparing sargramostim and filgrastim published by the same author found that with the exception of a slightly higher incidence of grade 1 fever (37.1 to 38.0\u00b0C) with sargramostim compared to filgrastim (48 vs 26%, respectively; P=0.01), there were no statistically significant differences in the incidence or severity of local or systemic adverse events potentially related to CSFs. Although the study was not designed to evaluate efficacy direc tly, there were also no statistically significant differences between treatment groups in total days of growth factor therapy, days of hospitalization or days of IV antibiotic therapy during the treatment period. Both agents were well tolerated and there were no clinically significant differences between them. 23 A Cochrane review of 13 randomized, placebo- controlled trials was performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of G -CSF (filgrastim and lenograstim [not available in the United States]) or GM- CSF (sargramostim) compared to placebo in patients who were receiving nonmyeloablative chemotherapy for malignant lymphomas. Sensitivity analyses that were performed in this review concluded that there were no differences between G -CSF and GM- CSF in their effects on overall survival, freedom from treatment failure and risk reduction in incidence of neutropenia or febrile neutropenia. 24 Two retrospective, case- controlled cohort trials were conducted to compare filgrastim, pegfilgrastim and sargramostim in reducing the risks of neutropenia- related hospitalizations in cancer patients receiving chemotherapies. Weycker et al found that the use of pegfilgrastim was associated with fewer hospitalizations for neutropenic complications compared to filgrastim and sargramostim (1.1, 2.1 and Therapeutic Class Review: colony stimulating factors Page 5 of 59 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 2/29/201 6 2.5%, respectively; P<0.001 for both filgrastim and to pegfilgrastim).20 Heaney et al found that sargramostim was associated with fewer infection- related hospitalizations compared to P=0.0422) for febrile neutropenia was also lower in the sargramostim group compared to the filgrastim and pegfilgrastim groups; however, these differences were not statisticall y significant.25 There were additional studies compared filgrastim to sargramostim. In these studies, efficacy favored filgrastim overall. Filgrastim had statistically significant fewer episodes of fever in nonmyeloid malignancies in patients receiving myelosuppressive anticancer drugs ( P<0.001). For collection of progenitor cells by leukapheresis, the filgrastim group had significantly greater CD34+ harvested than the sargramostim group (P=0.0001). Additionally, ANC recover was significantly more rapid in the filgrastim group and there were significantly fewer patients with a temperature >38.5\u00b0C , patients who received IV antibiotics or red blood cells and hospital admissions. 44 One study had mixed results that showed sargramostim improved time to ANC recover compared with filgrastim, but required a greater number of days with growth factor (P<0.001 and P=0.001, respectively). In this study, there were no differences between time to platelet recovery, number of days patients experienced fever or received IV antibiotics, the number of platelet transfusions and the number of red blood cell units received. 50 Tbo-filgrastim was evaluated in a single multi -center, placebo- and active- controlled, randomized control trial that evaluated patients with breast cancer. Patients received tbo- filgrastim, filgrastim, or placebo for cycle one. For cycle two to four, patients that received placebo were switched to tbo- filgrastim. Doses were 5g/kg daily for both active treatment groups for all cycles. The primary efficacy endpoint was duration of severe neutropenia in cycle one. When compared to placebo, tbo- filgrastim was provided a statistically significant improvement in duration of severe neutropenia (no P value reported). When compared to filgrastim, tbo- filgrastim was considered equivalent with a least square mean difference of 0.028 (95% CI, -0.262 to 0.325). Secondary endpoints showed no differences between tbo- filgrastim and filgrastim during any cycle or overall.38 Two additional studies published showed similar results but in patients with aggressive non- Hodgkin's lymphoma and small cell or non- small cell lung cancer.39,40Therapeutic Class Review: colony stimulating factors Page 6 of 59 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 2/29/201 6 Table 4.

Pegfilgrastim was less likely to be used to treat febrile neutropenia compared to filgrastim (17.3 vs 29.7%; P value not reported). The duration of treatment with daily G -CSF was not repor ted. Similar percentage of patients had a delay in chemotherapy administration in the filgrastim and pegfilgrastim groups (46.0 and 44.0%, respectively; P value not reported). However, 20.7% of patients receiving filgrastim had a chemotherapy dose reducti on due to neutropenia, compared to 6.7% of patients receiving pegfilgrastim (P value not reported). There were fewer incidences of febrile neutropenia and hospitalization due to febrile neutropenia in the pegfilgrastim group compared to the filgrastim group. The incidences of febrile neutropenia in the filgrastim and pegfilgrastim groups were 24.3 and 10.7%, respectively (P value not reported), while the incidences of hospitalization due to febrile neutropenia were 19.8 and 9.3%, respectively (P value not reported). Fewer patients in the pegfilgrastim group received treatment of antibiotics due to febrile neutropenia compared to the filgrastim group (8.0 vs 17.1%; P value not reported). Bone pain was reported in 2.7 and 1.3% of patients in the filgrast im and pegfilgrastim groups, respectively.

In four patients, the absolute eosinophil count increased from values below 1,000 cells/L to 3,200 to 5,700 cells/L . AMC increased two to six fold in four of the five patients as well. Other blood cells such as erythrocytes, platelets or lymphocytes did not change significantly during rhGM- CSF treatment ( P values not reported). Treatment with rhG -CSF increased ANC levels to >1,000 cells/L in all five patients. The absolute eosinophil count was not significantly augmented in all patients (one patient increased fivefold from baseline [oscillation between 100 and 800 cells/L ]). AMC increased two to eight fold in three of the five patients. Four of the five patients maintained an ANC count >1,000 cells/L during days 43 to 142 of rhG- CSF therapy.

The one patient who had no change in their infection with rhGM- CSF therapy had their infection resolved within six weeks of rhG -CSF therapy. The other four patients did not experience any bacterial infections during rhG -CSF therapy. Both rhGM- CSF and rhG -CSF were tolerated well by all patients. During the highest dose level of rhGM- CSF treatment (30 g/kg/day), a mild local phlebitis at the infusion site was observed in all patients. The only serious side effect occurred with rhG -CSF treat ment in one patient who suffered from a cutaneous necrotizing vasculitis on both lower legs which resolved with a lowering of the dose. One patient had an increase in serum alkaline phosphatase from 285 U/L 441 units/L after rhG -CSF therapy. The other four patients had no change. Liver and renal functions remained normal.

Three patients had graft rejection (only host cells in circulation), two of which responded to rhGM- CSF therapy with recovery of host hematopoiesis. Four patients had onl y donor hematopoietic cells detected at the time of treatment and all responded to rhGM- CSF. Prior to initiating rhGM- CSF therapy, seven patients had evidence of grade I or II GVHD and none had a GVHD exacerbation. Of the seven patients who received chemically purged autologous marrow, none responded to rhGM- CSF therapy. The four autologous BMT recipients who were administered doses of rhGM- CSF >500 g/m 2/day developed myalgias and bone pain during the infusion which resolved within two hours after c ompletion of the rhGM- CSF infusion. At doses <250 g/m2/day, toxicity thought to be associated with rhGM- CSF was observed in one patient who developed sternal and joint pain. In addition, bilirubin increased in three patients and diminished in two others. Overall, 19 patients remained alive after follow -up.

Clinical Guidelines Clinical Guideline Recommendations National Comprehensive Cancer Network: Myeloid Growth Factors Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (2010) 11 Prophylactic use of colony -stimulating factors (CSFs) \u00b7 For patients at high risk of febrile neutropenia, prophylactic CSFs is recommended if the risk of febrile neutropenia is 20% or greater and for any patient considered at high risk, regardless of whether the treatment is intended to be curative, to prolong survival or to manage symptoms. \u00b7 Patients at intermediate risk of febrile neutropenia: o Intermediate risk is defined as a 10 to 20% probability of developing febrile neutropenia or a neutropenic event that would compromise treatment. o Whether the treatment is intended to be curative, to prolong survival or to manage symptoms, it is recommended that individualized consideration of CSF therapy be based on physician -patient discussion of the risk -benefit ratio of the likelihood of developing febrile neutropenia, the potential consequences of a neutropenic event and the implications of reduced chemotherapy doses. o If patient risk factors determine the risk, CSF is a reasonable prophylactic option. o If the risk is due to the chemotherapy regimen and the treatment is intended to prolong survival or to manage symptoms, other alternatives such as the use of less myelosuppressive chemotherapy or dose reduction, if of comparable benefit, should be explored. \u00b7 Patients at low risk of febrile neutropenia: o In patients at low risk of febrile neutropenia, defined as <10% risk, routine use of CSFs is not considered cost -effective, and alternative treatment options are appropriate. o CSFs may be considered if the patient is receiving curative or adjuvant treatment and is at significant risk for serious medical consequences of febrile neutropenia, including death. \u00b7 Evaluation of subsequent chemotherapy cycles: o Patient evaluation should occur prior to each subsequent chemotherapy cycle to determine the risk categorization and treatment intent. o If a patient experiences an episode of febrile neutropenia or a dose- limiting neutropenic event despite receiving CSF therapy, it is recommended that a chemotherapy dose reduction or change in treatment regimen occurs unless there is an impact on patient survival. \u00b7 Chemotherapy regimens and risk of febrile neutropenia: o CSF prophylaxis is recommended when using a chemotherapy regimen with an incidence of >20% of febrile neutropenia. o Benefits of pegfilgrastim have not been shown in regimens given under two week duration; therefore, it should be avoided in patients receiving weekly chemotherapy. Therapeutic uses of CSFs \u00b7 Patients with febrile neutropenia who are receiving prophylactic filgrastim or sargramostim should continue with CSF therapy. However, since pegfilgrastim is long -acting, those who have received prophylaxis with Therapeutic Class Review: colony stimulating factors Page 49 of 59 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 2/29/201 6 Clinical Guideline Recommendations pegfilgrastim should not be treated with an additional CSF. \u00b7 Due to the lack of evidence supporting the therapeutic use of pegfilgrastim, only filgrastim and sargramostim should be used in this therapeutic setting. \u00b7 It is recommended for those who have not received prophylactic CSFs to be evaluated for risk factors for infection- related complications or poor clinical outcome. These include: old age (>65 years), sepsis syndrome, severe (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] <100 cells/\u00b5L) or anticipated prolonged (>10 days) neutropenia, pneumonia, invasive fungal infection or other clinically -documented infections. If risk factors are present, CSFs shoul d be considered. Dosing and administration \u00b7 Based on available data regarding the CSFs in prophylaxis of febrile neutropenia, when choosing among the myeloid growth factors, filgrastim and pegfilgrastim are considered to have more evidence than sargramostim. \u00b7 Initial doses of filgrastim are started at a daily dose of 5 \u00b5g/kg beginning within one to three days after completion of chemotherapy until post -nadir ANC recovery to normal or near -normal ANC levels by laboratory standards. \u00b7 There is evidence to support the use of pegfilgrastim 24 hours after completion of chemotherapy given every three weeks in one dose of 6 mg per cycle of treatment. \u00b7 Administration of filgrastim or pegfilgrastim within 24 hours after completion of chemotherapy is not recomm ended. \u00b7 There is insufficient evidence to support a strong recommendation for sargramostim in nonmyeloid malignancies. \u00b7 Subcutaneous administration is preferred pegfilgrastim sargramostim. Severe chronic neutropenia \u00b7 Granulocyte CSF (G -CSF) is an established effective treatment for cyclic, congenital and idiopathic neutropenia. The American Society of Clinical Oncology: 2006 Update of Recommendations for the Use of White Blood Cell Growth Factors: An Evidence- based Clinical Practice Guideline (2006) 12 \u00b7 Reduction in febrile neutropenia is an important clinical outcome that justifies the use of CSFs, regardless of their impact on other factors, when the risk of febrile neutropenia is approximately 20% and no other equally effective regim en that does not require CSFs is available. Primary prophylactic CSF administration (first and subsequent -cycle use) \u00b7 Primary prophylaxis is recommended for the prevention of febrile neutropenia in patients who have a high risk of febrile neutropenia based on age, medical history, disease characteristics and myelotoxicity of the chemotherapy regimen. \u00b7 For \"dose dense\" regimens, CSFs are required and recommended. \u00b7 The standard of care is to use chemotherapy regimens that do not require CSFs because of equal efficacy and lower risk of febrile neutropenia if such regimens are available. \u00b7 Current data demonstrates effectiveness and supports the use of CSFs when regimens that have a febrile neutropenia incidence of >20% are used; therefore, this practice is recomm ended. Secondary prophylactic CSF administration \u00b7 Secondary prophylaxis with CSFs is recommended for patients who experienced a neutropenic complication from a prior cycle of chemotherapy Therapeutic Class Review: colony stimulating factors Page 50 of 59 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 2/29/201 6 Clinical Guideline Recommendations (for which primary prophylaxis was not received), in which a reduce d dose may compromise disease- free or overall survival or treatment outcome. Therapeutic use of CSF \u00b7 CSFs should not be routinely used for patients with neutropenia who are afebrile. \u00b7 CSFs should not be routinely used as adjunctive treatment with antibiotic therapy for patients with febrile neutropenia. However, CSFs should be considered in patients with febrile neutropenia who are at high- risk for infection associated complications, or who have prognostic factors that are predictive of poor clinical outcomes. Use of CSFs to increase chemotherapy dose- intensity and dose- density \u00b7 Use of CSFs allows a modest to moderate increase in dose density and/or dose- intensity of chemotherapy regimens. \u00b7 A survival benefit is suggested by the current data when CSFs are used with dose- dense regimens in specific settings (e.g., node- positive breast cancer and possibly non- Hodgkin's lymphoma [NHL]), but this data cannot be applied to other diseases. \u00b7 It is recommended to only use dose dense regimens within an appropriately designed clinical trial or when use is supported by convincing efficacy data. Use of CSFs as adjuncts to progenitor -cell transplantation \u00b7 The current standard of care is the administration of CSFs to mobilize peripheral -blood progenitor cell (PBPC) often in conjunction with chemotherapy and their administration after autologous, but not allogeneic, PBPC transplantation. Use of CSFs in patients with acute leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes \u00b7 For acute myeloid leukemia (AML), CSF use following initial induction therapy is reasonable, as studies have demonstrated a decrease in neutropenia duration, although there has been no favorable impact on remission rate, remission duration or survival. Patients older than 55 years of age may be most likely to benefit from CSF use. \u00b7 For priming of leukemia cells in patients with AML, use of CSFs is not recommended. \u00b7 After the completion of consolidation chemotherapy, CSF use can be recommended to possibly decrease the incidence of infection and eliminate the likelihood of hospitalization in some patients receiving intensive post - remission chemotherapy. \u00b7 Due to the lack of information regarding pegylated CSFs in patients with myeloid leukemia, it is rec ommended that they not be used in such patients outside of clinical trials. \u00b7 For myelodysplastic syndromes, intermittent administration of CSFs may be considered in certain patients with severe neutropenia and recurrent infection; however, there is a lack of data supporting the routine long- term continuous use of CSFs in these patients. \u00b7 For acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), to reduce the duration of neutropenia, CSFs are recommended after the completion of the initial first few days of chemotherapy of the initial induction or first post remission course. \u00b7 For acute leukemia in relapse it is recommended that CSFs be used Therapeutic Class Review: colony stimulating factors Page 51 of 59 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 2/29/201 6 Clinical Guideline Recommendations judiciously, or not at all, in patients with refractory or relapsed myeloid leukemia due to the lack of expected response. Use of CSFs in patients receiving radiotherapy with or without concurrent chemotherapy \u00b7 In those patients who are expected to have prolonged delays in radiation treatment due to neutropenia and are not receiving chemotherapy, CSFs may be considered. \u00b7 In those patients receiving concurrent chemotherapy and radiation of the mediastinum, CSFs should be avoided. Use of CSFs in older patients \u00b7 To reduce the incidence of febrile neutropenia and infections, prophylactic CSFs should be given to patients 65 years of age and older with diffuse aggressive lymphoma treated with curative chemotherapy (CHOP [cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone] or more aggressive regimens). Use of CSFs in the pediatric population \u00b7 The use of CSFs in pediatric patients will almost always be guided by clinical protocols. The use of CSFs is reasonable for the primary prophylaxis of pediatric patients with a likelihood of febrile neutropenia. \u00b7 The use of CSFs for secondary prophylaxis or for therapy should be limited to high- risk patients. \u00b7 Due to the potential risk for secondary myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome associated with CSFs, their use represents a concern in children with ALL whose prognosis is otherwise excellent. For these reasons, the use of CSFs in children with ALL should be considered with caution. CSF initiation, duration, dosing and administration \u00b7 CSFs should be given 24 to 72 hours after the administration of myelotoxic chemotherapy and should be continued until the ANC reaches at least 2 to 3x109 cells/L. \u00b7 For PBPC mobilization, CSFs should be started at least four days before the first leukapheresis procedure and continued until the last leukapheresis. \u00b7 In adults, the recommended CSF doses are 5 g/kg/day for G -CSF and 250 g/m2/day for granulocyte macrophage CSF (G M-CSF) for all clinical settings other than PBPC mobilization. \u00b7 In the setting of PBPC mobilization, if G -CSF is used, a dose of 10 g/kg/day maybe preferable. \u00b7 The preferred route of CSF administration is subcutaneous. Pegylated G -CSF initiation, duration, dosing and administration \u00b7 Pegfilgrastim 6 mg should be given once 24 hours after completion of chemotherapy. \u00b7 The 6 mg formulation should not be used in infants, children or small adolescents weighing less than 45 kg. Special comments on comparative clini cal activity of G -CSF and GM- CSF \u00b7 No guideline recommendation can be made regarding the equivalency of the two CFSs. \u00b7 Further trials are recommended to study the comparative clinical activity, Therapeutic Class Review: colony stimulating factors Page 52 of 59 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 2/29/201 6 Clinical Guideline Recommendations toxicity and cost -effectiveness of G -CSF and GM -CSF. Special comments on growth factors as a treatment for radiation injury \u00b7 Current recommendations for the management of patients exposed to lethal doses of total body radiotherapy, but not doses high enough to lead to certain death due to injury to other organs, includes the prompt administration of CSF or pegylated G -CSF. European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer: 2010 Update of European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Guidelines for the Use of Granulocyte - Colony Stimulating Factor to Reduce the Incidence of Chemotherapy - Induced Febrile Neutropenia in Adult Patients with Lymphoproliferative Disorders and Solid Tumors (2010) 14 Patient -related risk factors for increased risk of febrile neutropenia \u00b7 Prevention of chemotherapy -induced febrile neutropenia should be considered a clinical priority. \u00b7 Prior to administering each cycle of chemotherapy, evaluation of patient - related risk factors should be included in the overall assessment. \u00b7 Other risk factors that should be evaluated for include: elderly age (aged 65 and over), advanced stage of disease, experience of previous episode(s) of febrile neutropenia, lack of G -CSF use and lack of antibiotic prophylaxis. \u00b7 Indiscriminate use of antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended. Chemotherapy regimens associated with increased risk of febrile neutropenia \u00b7 Chemotherapy regimens are categorized based on their potential to cause febrile neutropenia (>20%, 10 to 20%, <10%); therefore, this risk should be taken into consideration when using certain chemotherapy regimens. G-CSF to support chemotherapy \u00b7 G- CSF prophylaxis should be used as supportive treatment in cases when dose- dense or dose- intense chemotherapy regimens have demonstrated survival benefits. \u00b7 G- CSF should be used as primary prophylaxis to maintain a chemotherapy regimen if dose or intensity reduction has demonstrated poor prognosis when the treatment is potentially curative or intended to prolong survival. \u00b7 When the treatment is palliative, the use of less myelosuppressive chemotherapy or dose/schedule modification should be considered. Impact of the overall febrile neutropenia risk on G -CSF use \u00b7 At the beginning of each cycle, each patient should be individually assessed for the risk of complication related to febrile neutropenia which should include patient -related risk factors, the chemotherapy regimen and associated complications and treatment intent. \u00b7 Prophylactic G -CSF therapy is recommended in patients whose overall risk of febrile neutropenia is >20%. \u00b7 When a chemotherapy regimen associated with a febrile neutropenia risk of 10 to 20% is used, patient characteristics should be taken into account when reviewing the overall risk of febrile neutropenia. G-CSF in patients with existing febrile neutropenia \u00b7 G- CSF treatment in patients with solid tumors and malignant lymphoma should be reserved for those patients who are not responding to appropriate antibiotic management and who are developing life- threatening infections (such as severe sepsis or septic shock). Choice of formulation \u00b7 Where indicated, filgrastim, lenograstim* and pegfilgrastim are all recommended to prevent febrile neutropenia and febrile neutropenia related Therapeutic Class Review: colony stimulating factors Page 53 of 59 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 2/29/201 6 Clinical Guideline Recommendations complications due to their clinical efficacy and studies demonstrating comparable efficacy. British Committee for Standards in Hematology: Guidelines on the Use of Colony - stimulating Factors in Hematological Malignancies (2003) 54 \u00b7 Due to the lack of comparative trials and clinical trial data, there seems to be no evidence demonstrating efficacy or outcome differences between the G - CSF and GM- CSF products when administered at recommended doses. These guidelines do not differentiate between the agents. Prophylactic and adjunctive use \u00b7 Primary prophylaxis is not routinely recommended unless the expec ted incidence of febrile neutropenia is >40%. \u00b7 Secondary prophylaxis cannot be routinely justified because of a lack of available evidence but is indicated for tumors in which dose reduction or dose delay would compromise overall survival. \u00b7 Adjunctive treatment is not recommended for patients with uncomplicated febrile neutropenia but should be considered in patients with poor prognostic factors. Use of CSFs in association with chemotherapy \u00b7 AML: The routine use of CSF is recommended after consolidation chemotherapy. CSF is recommended after induction if it is appropriate to reduce hospital stay or antibiotic usage. \u00b7 ALL: G -CSF is indicated to reduce the severity of neutropenia following intensive phases of therapy. \u00b7 Myelodysplastic syndromes: CSFs are indicted to reduce the severity of neutropenia in patients receiving intensive chemotherapy. CSFs are also recommended on an intermittent basis for patients with neutropenia and infection, but continuous prophylactic use is not routinely justified. \u00b7 Aplastic anemia: There is insufficient evidence to make any general recommendations. Hence patients should be given CSFs only on an individual therapeutic trial basis. \u00b7 Bone marrow failure syndromes: G -CSF is recommended when improvement of neutrophil count is appropr iate. \u00b7 Malignant lymphomas: There is evidence to support the routine use of CSFs to reduce the incidence of infection, chemotherapy delay and hospitalization, especially when the risk of febrile neutropenia exceeds 40%. There is also emerging evidence of improved survival with G -CSF-supported dose intensification in elderly patients with high- grade NHL. At present, this evidence is insufficient to justify a change in policy in all patients with lymphoma, but elderly patients may benefit from G -CSF support. CSFs for PBPC mobilization \u00b7 CSFs are indicated for the mobilization of PBPCs. CSFs after PBSC and marrow transplantation \u00b7 CSFs are indicated to accelerate reconstitution after allogeneic and autologous PBPC transplantation or bone marrow transplant. National Comprehensive Cancer Network: Acute Myeloid Leukemia Clinical Practice Monitoring and supportive care \u00b7 Growth factor support may be considered in the elderly once chemotherapy is complete. \u00b7 Recommendations regarding the use of cytokines for infection or for slow marrow recovery are left to institutional policy. \u00b7 G-CSF or GM -CSF should be discontinued for a minimum of seven days Therapeutic Class Review: colony stimulating factors Page 54 of 59 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 2/29/201 6 Clinical Guideline Recommendations Guidelines in Oncology (2011)13 before obtaining bone marrow to document remission as CSF therapy may confound interpretation of the bone marrow. \u00b7 Growth factors should not be used in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia. British Committee for Standards in Hematology: Guidelines on the Management of Acute Myeloid Leukemia in Adults (2006) 55 Growth factors \u00b7 Growth factors following AML chemotherapy have shown no survival benefit but have demonstrated reduction in the duration of neutropenia, antibiotic use and hospital stay. \u00b7 The cost -benefit advantages of routine growth factor use are uncertain. \u00b7 G- CSF is recommended after induction if it is appropriate to reduce hospital stay or antibiotic usage. \u00b7 The routine use of growth factor therapy in AML is not recommended. Standard chemotherapy \u00b7 There is insufficient evidence to support routine use of G -CSF or GM -CSF with induction chemotherapy in patients over 60 years of age, although this may be appropriate if it is desirable to reduce hospitalization or antibiotic usage. Management of AML in patients who are pregnant \u00b7 Pregnant patients with other forms of AML, other than promyelocytic leukemia- retinoic acid receptor -positive acute promyelocytic leukemia, and with stable disease may defer chemotherapy and be supported with growth factors and blood products until delivery can be safely induced at about 30 weeks. National Comprehensive Cancer Network: Myelodysplastic Syndromes Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (2011) 56 Supportive care \u00b7 Use of G -CSF or GM -CSF is not recommended for routine infection prophylaxis. \u00b7 Use of G -CSF or GM -CSF may be considered in a neutropenic patient who has recurrent or resistant infections. \u00b7 Low-dose G -CSF or GM -CSF may be combined with recombinant human erythropoietin for anemia when indicated, particularly in patients who are not responding to erythropoiesis -stimulating agents and have serum erythropoietin level of 500 mUnits/mL or less. United Kingdom Myelodysplastic Syndromes Guideline Group: Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Therapy of Adult Myelodysplastic Syndromes (2003) 57 Erythropoietin with or without G -CSF \u00b7 Many studies have clearly demonstrated that erythropoietin\u00b1G -CSF can increase hemoglobin levels and reduce or eliminate red blood cell transfusion in selected myelodysplastic syndromes patients. \u00b7 It is recommended that patients with refractory anemia and refractory anemia with excess blasts who are not eligible for chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation and are symptomatic of anemia, with no or low transfusion requirement (<2 units /month) and a baseline erythropoietin level <200 units/L who have not responded to a trial of erythropoietin alone for six weeks be considered for daily G -CSF therapy, doubling the dose of erythropoietin or both for six more weeks. The G -CSF dose should be doubled weekl y (e.g., 75 g to 150 g then to 300 g) to maintain the white blood cell between 6 and 10x 10 9 cells/ L. In patients who respond, once the maximum response has been reached, the G -CSF can be reduced to thrice weekly, and the erythropoietin dose can be reduced by one day a week at four weekly intervals (e.g., five days a week to four days then three days) to the lowest dose that retains response. \u00b7 It is recommended that the combination of erythropoietin and G -CSF be Therapeutic Class Review: colony stimulating factors Page 55 of 59 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 2/29/201 6 Clinical Guideline Recommendations used from the beginning for patients wi th refractory anemia with excess blasts, symptomatic anemia, baseline erythropoietin levels <500 units/L and a transfusion requirement <2 units/month. \u00b7 Due to the lack of published data, it is encouraged to continue randomized- controlled trials of erythrop oietin\u00b1G -CSF to address the issues of quality of life, survival advantage and pharmacoeconomics. Prophylactic management of infection \u00b7 Prophylactic low -dose G -CSF therapy may be considered in patients who are severely neutropenic in order to maintain a neutrophil count >1X109 cells/L. Conclusions Colony -stimulating factors (CSFs) are growth factors which stimulate the production and enhance recovery of neutrophils.58 There are currently two types of CSFs available in the United States, granulocyte CSF (G .1-3,5 Filgratstim -sndz is considered a biosimilar drug to parent molecule filgrastim ; however , due to regulatory pathways for biosimilar drugs being available at the time, tbo- filgrastim is not. Tbo- filgrastim was filed with its own Biologic Drug Application and thus does not share the same indications. Since the time the application for filgrastim - sndz was submitted, the parent molecule, filgrastim was granted an additional indication that filgrastim - sndz does not have.1,2,9 Sargramostim is the only GM-CSF currently available.4 G-CSFs are largely used to prevent and reduce the duration of neutropenia in patients receiving chemotherapy.59 Several clinical trials have demonstrated efficacy of the G -CSFs for this indication. A systematic review published in 2007 reviewed 17 randomized controlled trials comparing primary prophylactic G -CSF to placebo or untreated controls in adult solid tumor and malignant lymphoma patients. The review reported an overall 46% decrease in the risk of febrile neutropenia, a 45% decrease in infection- related mortality and a 40% decrease in all -cause mortality during the chemotherapy period. 60 Currently the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) guidelines recommend CSF prophylaxis in patients whose overall risk of febrile neutropenia is >20%. 9,10,16 Recent retrospective data has reported a potential advantage of pegfilgrastim in reducing the risk of hospitalizations due to febrile neutropenia when compared to filgrastim and sargramostim, while an earlier prospective, randomized trial demonstrated comparable clinical efficacy between filgrastim and pegfilgrastim for the indication of febrile neutropenia. 18-21 The NCCN and the EORTC guidelines currently recommend either G -CSF equally for treatment.11,13 Moreover, with the lack of clinical studies comparing the efficacy of the G -CSFs and GM- CSF, the ASCO guidelines do not provide recommendations regarding the specific types of product s,12 whereas the NCCN states filgrastim and pegfilgrastim have stronger evidence than sargramostim supporting their use.11 Additional studies are needed to determine the safety and efficacy differences among the G -CSFs and GM- CSF in febrile neutropenia as well as the other indications.

Page 1 of 3 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 3/1/2016 New Drug Overview Diclegis\u00ae (doxylamine -receptor agonist indicated in adults for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS- D). It is a locally active visceral analgesic, with low systemic absorption and bioavailability. The \u00b5-opioid agonist activity works by inhibiting gastrointestinal (GI) motility and secretion and the -opioid receptor antagonism works by mitigating against the constipating effects of unopposed peripherally acting \u00b5-opioid receptor agonist.1,2 This agent was assigned a Schedule IV designation due to its documented low potential for abuse and low risk of dependence.3 IBS is a functional bowel disorder characterized by chronic abdominal pain and altered bowel habits, in the absence of obvious structural or inflammatory abnormalities. It is thought to affect approximately 5 to 15% of the general population with the majority of cases occurring in individuals between the ages of 15 and 65 years.4 Although the exact cause of IBS -D is not k nown, symptoms are thought to result from a disturbance in the way the GI tract and nervous system interact. IBS-D is a subset of irritable bowel syndrome that is defined as the presence of loose or watery stools with 25 percent of bowel movements and hard or lumpy stools with < 25 percent of bowel movements. This subtype accounts for approximately one- third of all IBS cases in the U.S. Rome III criteria are currently considered the \"Gold Standard\" for the diagnosis of IBS. These include recurrent abdominal pain or discomfort for at least three days per month in the last three months associated with two or more of the following: improvement with defecation, onset associated with a change in stool frequency, onset associated with a change in stool form. 5 Currently there are a few therapeutic options that exist to manage the symptoms of abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea and fecal urgency. These include non- pharmacologic options of lifestyle and dietary modifications as well as pharmacologic therapies such as antidiarrheals (e.g., (SSRIs) (e.g., sertraline). 5 The only other FDA -approved treatments for IBS-D currently include Xifaxan\u00ae (rifaximin) which received this expanded indication in 2015 and Lotronex\u00ae (alosetron) which is restricted to women and requires prescribers to enroll in the Prometheus Prescribing Program due to its black box warning for potentially serious GI adverse reactions such as ischemic colitis and severe constipation. 6 Table 1.

Both trials were 26 weeks long. Individuals were randomized to receive twice daily placebo, eluxadoline 75 mg or eluxadoline 100 mg. In Study IBS-3001, the double- blinded treatment period was continued for an additional 26 weeks to monitor long-term safety (total of 52 weeks of treatment), followed by a two-week follow -up. Study IBS-3002 included a four-week single- blinded, placebo- withdrawal period upon completion of the 26- week treatment period. Efficacy of eluxadoline was assessed in both trials using an overall composite responder primary endpoint. This was defined by patients meeting the daily response criteria (pain and stool consistency) for 50% of the days with diary entries for two criteria: daily pain response (improvement in WAP scores in the past 24 hours by 30% compared to baseline) and daily stool consistency (BSS score < five or the absence of a bowel movement if accompanied by 30% improvement in WAP compared to baseline pain). The primary endpoints for the IBS-3001 trial, showed that the proportion of composite responders for the 75 mg and 100 mg treatment groups had a statistically greater response than placebo for weeks 1 to 12 ( P<0.025) and weeks 1 to 26 for the 100 mg treatment group (P<0.001). In the IBS-3002 trial, the proportion of composite responders for the eluxadoline 75 mg and 100 mg groups had a statistically greater response than placebo for weeks 1 to 12 (P<0.001) and weeks 1 to 26 (P=0.001). The onset for response was noted to be within the first week of dosing in both trials. 2,10 Key Points within the Medication Class \u00b7 Due to limited therapeutic options for the treatment of IBS -D, clinical guidelines have consistently provided only moderate or weak recommendations for the use of all agents, new and old.7-9 o All current clinical guidelines suggest rifaximin, alosetron, TCA s, SSRIs, and antispasmodics are effective, but their place in therapy is not well defined and varies by guideline. Loperamide was granted a conditional recommendation by the American Gastrointestinal Association (AGA) due to its usefulness as a potential adjunctive therapy for the management of diarrhea, however the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) and World Gastroenterology Organization Global Guidelines do not recommend its use due to no relief of the global symptoms of IBS- D. 7-9 o Only the World Gastroenterology Organization mentions the use of eluxadoline, but acknowledges that although it has been approved for use in the United States, its position in the management of IBS is difficult to define at this time. 9 \u00b7 Other Key Facts: o Efficacy of Viberzi\u00ae (eluxadoline) beyond 26 weeks has not been established. o This agent has shown equal efficacy in men and women, unlike alosetron which is indicated only in women. 2 New Drug Overview: doxylamine succinate/pyridoxine hydrochloride (Diclegis\u00ae) Page 3 of 3 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 3/1/16 References 1.

It is a locally active visceral analgesic, with low systemic absorption and bioavailability. The \u00b5-opioid agonist activity works by inhibiting gastrointestinal (GI) motility and secretion and the -opioid receptor antagonism works by mitigating against the constipating effects of unopposed peripherally acting \u00b5-opioid receptor agonist.1,2 This agent was assigned a Schedule IV designation due to its documented low potential for abuse and low risk of dependence. 3 IBS is a functional bowel disorder characterized by chronic abdominal pain and altered bowel habits, in the absence of obvious structural or inflammatory abnormalities. It is thought to affect approximately 5 to 15% of the general population with the majority of cases occurring in individuals between the ages of 15 and 65 years. 4 Although the exact cause of IBS -D is not k nown, symptoms are thought to result from a disturbance in the way the GI tract and nervous system interact. IBS-D is a subset of irritable bowel syndrome that is defined as the presence of loose or watery stools with 25 percent of bowel movements and hard or lumpy stools with < 25 percent of bowel movements. This subtype accounts for approximately one-third of all IBS cases in the U.S. Rome III criteria are currently considered the \"Gold Standard\" for the diagnosis of IBS. These include recurrent abdominal pain or discomfort for at least three days per month in the last three months associated with two or more of the following: improvement with defecation, onset associated with a change in stool frequency, onset associated with a change in stool form. 5 Currently there are a few therapeutic options that exist to manage the symptoms of abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea and fecal urgency. These include non- pharmacologic options of lifestyle and dietary modifications as well as pharmacologic therapies such as antidiarrheals (e.g., (SSRIs) (e.g., sertraline). 5 The only other FDA -approved treatments for IBS - D currently include Xifaxan\u00ae (rifaximin) which received this expanded indication in 2015 and Lotronex\u00ae (alosetron) which is restricted to women and requires prescribers to enroll in the Prometheus Prescribing Program due to its black box warning for potentially serious GI adverse reactions such as ischemic colitis and severe constipation. 6 Due to limited therapeutic options for the treatment of IBS -D, clinical guidelines have consistently provided only moderate or weak recommendations for the use of all agents, new and old.

Both trials were 26 weeks long. Individuals were randomized to receive twice daily placebo, eluxadoline 75 mg or eluxadoline 100 mg. In Study IBS-3001, the double- blinded treatment period was continued for an additional 26 weeks to monitor long-term safety (total of 52 weeks of treatment), followed by a two-week follow -up. Study IBS-3002 included a four-week single- blinded, placebo- withdrawal period upon completion of the 26- week treatment period. During the double- blind treatment phase and the single- blinded placebo withdrawal phase, patients were allowed to take loperamide rescue medication for the acute treatment of uncontrolled diarrhea, but were not allowed to take any other antidiarrheal, antispasmodic agent or rifaximin for their diarr hea. 2,10 Efficacy of eluxadoline was assessed in both trials using an overall composite responder primary endpoint. This was defined by patients meeting the daily response criteria (pain and stool consistency) for 50% of the days with diary entries for two criteria: daily pain response (improvement in WAP scores in the past 24 hours by 30% compared to baseline) and daily stool consistency (BSS score < five or the absence of a bowel movement if accompanied by 30% improvement in WAP compared to baselin e pain). The primary endpoints for the IBS-3001 trial, showed that the proportion of composite responders for the 75 mg and 100 mg treatment groups had a statistically greater response than placebo for weeks 1 to 12 ( P<0.025) and weeks 1 to 26 for the 100 mg treatment group (P<0.001). In the IBS-3002 trial, the proportion of composite responders for the eluxadoline 75 mg and 100 mg groups had a statistically greater response than placebo for weeks 1 to 12 (P<0.001) and weeks 1 to 26 (P=0.001). The onset for response was noted to be within the first week of dosing in both trials. 2,10 Secondary endpoints in the IBS -3001 trial that were noted to be significant included the proportion of stool consistency responders in the eluxadoline 75 mg group (P=0.008) and 100 mg group (P<0.001) compared with placebo for weeks 1 to 12 and the eluxadoline 100 mg group only (P=0.001) during weeks 1 to 26. The proportion of IBS -D global symptom responders was statistically significant compared with placebo for the eluxadoline 75 mg group (P=0.048) from weeks 1 to 12 and from weeks 21 to 24 (P=0.024). Lastly, the proportion of patients who reported adequate relief of their IBS symptoms was statistically significant for the eluxadoline 100 mg group (P 0.005) compared with placebo over weeks 1 to 12 and weeks 1 to 26 (P=0.005) . This was also apparent for the eluxadoline 75 mg group (P=0.008) compared to placebo over weeks 1 to 12. 2,10 The IBS -3002 trial also showed significant responses in the eluxadoline groups for several secondary endpoints. The proportion of stool consistency responders for the 75 mg and 100 mg eluxadoline treatment groups was statistically significant compared to placebo over weeks 1 to 12 and weeks 1 to 26 (P<0.001). A larger proportion of IBS -D global symptom responders for the 75 mg and 100 mg eluxadoline treatment groups had a statistically greater response than placebo over weeks 1 to 12 (P<0.001) and weeks 1 to 26 ( P0.012). The proportion of IBS -adequate relief (AR) responders for the eluxadoline 75 mg and 100 mg treatment groups was also greater than placebo ( P0.013) over weeks 1 to 12 and weeks 1 to 26. 2,10New Drug Review: eluxadoline (Viberzi\u00ae) Page 3 of 13 Copyright 2016 Completed on 3/1/2016 Table 2.

In addition, the proportion of composite responders for the 100 mg group (29.3%, P<0.001) had a statistically greater response than placebo (19.0% ) over weeks 1 to 26. Secondary: The proportion of pain responders was numerically higher in the eluxadoline 75 mg (43.2%; P=0.284) and 100 mg (42.4%; P=0.404) groups compared to placebo (39.6%) over weeks 1 to 12 but not statistically significant. This was the same for weeks 1 to 26. The proportion of stool consistency responders was statistically significant in the eluxadoline 75 mg group (P=0.008) and 100 mg group (P<0.001) compared with placebo for weeks 1 to 12 and the eluxadoline 100 mg group only (P=0.001) during weeks 1 to 26.

Warnings and Precautions 1 Warning/Precaution Eluxadoline Sphincter of Oddi spasm; there is a potential for increased risk of sphincter of Oddi spasm, resulting in pancreatic or hepatic enzyme elevation associated with acute abdominal pain with eluxadoline. Consider alternative therapies before using this agent in patients without a gallbladder. If decision is made to use in individuals without a gallbladder, use a reduced dosage of 75 mg twice daily. Instruct patients to stop eluxadoline and seek medical attention if they experience symptoms suggestive of sphincter of Oddi spasm such as acute worsening of abdominal pain, (e.g. acute epigastric or biliary [i.e., right upper quadrant] pain), that may radiate to the back or shoulder with or without nausea and vomiting, associated with elevations of pancreatic enzymes or liver transaminases. Do not restart this agent in patients who developed biliary duct obstruction or Oddi spasm while taking elu xadoline. a Pancreatitis; there is a potential for increased risk of pancreatitis, not associated with sphincter of Oddi spasm while taking eluxadoline. Instruct patients to avoid chronic or acute excessive alcohol use while taking eluxadoline. Monitor for new or worsening abdominal pain that may radiate to the back or shoulder, with or without nausea and vomiting. Instruct patients to stop this medication and seek medical attention if they experience symptoms suggestive of pancreatitis such as acute abd ominal or epigastric pain radiating to the back associated with elevations of pancreatic enzymes . a Drug Interactions Table 6.

Management: \u00b7 Specialized diets may improve symptoms in some IBS patients (e.g., fiber - rich diet or bulk -former combine with sufficient fluids, low in fermentable oligo- , di-, and monosaccharides and gluten- free diets) \u00b7 Some probiotics give global relief of symptoms in IBS and others alleviate individual symptoms such as bloating and flatulence. The duration of benefits and the nature of the most effective species are not clear. \u00b7 There is insufficient evidence for a general recommendation of prebiotics or synbiotics in patients with IBS. Overall symptoms in U.S.]) provide symptomatic short -term relief in IBS. \u00b7 Peppermint oil is superior to placebo in improving IBS symptoms. Overall symptoms - second- line therapy: \u00b7 Laxatives \u00b7 Antidiarrheals \u00b7 TCAs and SSRIs are effective for symptom relief in IBS. \u00b7 SSRIs may be considered in resistant IBS -C, although it is not current ly recommended that SSRIs be routinely prescribed for IBS in patients without comorbid psychiatric conditions due to conflicting and limited data on efficacy, safety and long -term outcomes. Overall symptoms - other therapeutic options : \u00b7 Rifaximin is effective in reducing overall symptoms in IBS -D. It may be considered as second- line therapy but its efficacy and safety has not been established beyond 16 weeks. Older patients and women were found to have higher response rates. \u00b7 Alosetron is useful for second- line therapy of IBS- D. It has however been associated with an increased risk of ischemic colitis and may cause severe constipation. \u00b7 Lubiprostone is safe and effective for treatment of IBS -C. \u00b7 Linaclotide is safe and effective for treatment of IBS -C. \u00b7 There is insufficient evidence to recommend loperamide for use in IBS. \u00b7 Mixed 5- HT4 agonists/5- HT3 antagonists are no more effective than placebo at improving symptoms of IBS -C. \u00b7 Renzapride (unavailable in U.S.) and cisapride have no benefit in IBS. \u00b7 Evidence is lacking for the use of PEG for overall symptoms of IBS but it may relieve constipation. New Drug Review: eluxadoline (Viberzi\u00ae) \\ Page 12 of 13 Copyright 2016 Completed on 3/1/2016 Clinical Guideline Recommendations \u00b7 Ondansetron improves urgency, diarrhea and bloating in IBS -D, but did not help with pain. Ramosetron (unavailable in U.S.) should be considered as second- line therapy in IBS- D. Specific symptoms -pain: \u00b7 If an analgesic is required, paracetamol (unavailable in U.S.) is preferable to nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Avoid opiates due to potential for dependence, addiction and undesirable side effects on the gastrointestinal tract. \u00b7 The probiotic strain Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 (one capsule per day) has been shown to reduce pain, bloating, and defecatory difficulty and to normalize stool habit in IBS patients, regardless of predominant bowel habit \u00b7 Antisp asmodics, including peppermint oil, are still considered to represent a first -line treatment for abdominal pain in patients with IBS . \u00b7 TCAs (amitriptyline [starting dose: 10 mg/day, bedtime], desipramine [target dose: 50 mg/day, target dose to 150 mg/day at bedtime]). Avoid use in constipated patients. \u00b7 SSRIs (paroxetine 10 to 60 mg/day, citalopram 5 to 20 mg/day). \u00b7 Linaclotide reduces abdominal pain in IBS -C. Specific symptoms - diarrhea: \u00b7 Loperamide (2 mg every morning or twice daily) is no more effective than placebo in reducing pain, bloating and global symptoms of IBS but it is an effective agent for management of diarrhea, reducing stool frequency and improving stool consistency. However, there is insufficient evidence to recommend loperamide for use in IBS. \u00b7 Alosetron is indicated for women with severe IBS -D with symptoms > six months and no response to antidiarrheal agents. \u00b7 Eluxadoline and rifaximin have recently been approved in the U.S. for IBS - D. However, it is d ifficult to define their position in IBS management at this time. Conclusions Viberzi \u00ae (eluxadoline) is a first -in-class, oral, locally -acting with opioid activity: it antagonist and -receptor agonist . This agent now offers another option for individuals diagnosed with IBS -D that is not adequately managed by conventional treatment. Current clinical guidelines support the use of less costly alternatives and have not been updated to address the use of eluxadoline and its place in therapy. 7-9 However, i n two phase III studies in IBS-D patients, eluxadoline demonstrated statistically significant improvements in abdominal pain and stool consistency, and had beneficial effects on stool freque ncy, urgency, and global IBS symptom scores .2 In addition, this agent has shown equal efficacy in men and women, unlike alosetron which is indicated only in women.2 Of note, efficacy beyond 26 weeks has not been established. While this is currently approved only for use in adults, additional studies in pediatric patients are underway.New Drug Review: eluxadoline (Viberzi\u00ae) \\ Page 13 of 13 Copyright 2016 3/1/2016 References 1.

The agent is Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -approved for the treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) in women who do not respond to conse rvative management. It should be noted that the agent has not been studied in hyperemesis gravidarum.1 The combination of doxylamine and pyridoxine was previously available in the United States under the brand name Bendectin\u00ae. However this product was removed from the market in 1983 due to law suits alleging teratogenicity, although scientific evidence supports the safety and efficacy of the medication. A meta- analysis of controlled studies on outcome of pregnancies exposed to Bendectin\u00ae reported no increase in the incidence of birth defects.2 Doxylamine competes with histamine for H1- receptor sites and blocks the chemoreceptor trigger zone thereby decreasing nausea and vomiting. Antihistamine agents also work indirectly on the vestibular system by decreasing stimulation of the vomiting center. Hypotheses to explain the antiemetic effects of pyridoxine include prevention/treatment of vitamin B6 deficiency, intrinsic antinausea properties, and/or synergy with the antinausea properties of antihistamine. 1-3 Nausea with or without vomiting is common in early pregnancy and affects 70 to 85% of pregnant women.2,4 Severe vomiting resulting in dehydration and weight loss is termed hyperemesis gravidarum and occurs infrequently. The treatment goals in patient with NVP are to reduce symptoms through changes in diet/environment and by medication, to correct consequences or complications of nausea and vomiting such as dehydration and to minimize the fetal effects of NVP treatment. 2 Table 1.

Patients (N=298) were randomized to 14 days of placebo or two tablets daily at bedtime and up to a maximum dose of four tablets of doxylamine succinate/pyridoxine hydrochloride . 5 Doxylamine succinate/pyridoxine hydrochloride treatment resulted in a statistically significant improvement in both the symptom and quality of life domains of the Pregnancy Unique- Quantification of Emesis (PUQE) score. There was a 4.8 point mean decrease from baseline in the symptom domain PUQE score at day 15 in the doxylamine succinate/pyridoxine hydrochloride group compared to 3.9 point decrease in the placebo group. For quality of life , there was also a 2.8 point mean increase from baseline in the score at day 15 in the Diclegis\u00ae (doxylamine succinate/pyridoxine hydrochloride) group compared to a 1.8 point decrease in the placebo group.5 New Drug Overview: doxylamine succinate/pyridoxine hydrochloride (Diclegis\u00ae) Page 2 of 2 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 2/29/16 \u00b7 A second study compared a five- day course of low -dose ondansetron to low -dose doxylamine succinate/pyridoxine hydrochloride.

The treatment goals in patient with NVP are to reduce symptoms through changes in diet/environment and by medication, to correct consequences or complications of nausea and vomiting such as dehydration and to minimize the fetal effects of NVP treatment. 2 According to the Obstetrician -Gynecolo gists Clinical Management Guideline for Nausea and Vomiting of Pregnancy, mild cases of nausea and vomiting may be resolved with lifestyle and dietary changes such as eating frequent small meals or avoiding spicy or fatty foods. For more severe cases, safe and effective treatments are available. The guideline recommends the use of monotherapy with pyridoxine or in combination with doxylamine as safe and effective and that these treatment options should be considered as first -line pharmacotherapy. A treatment algorithm provided in the guideline indicates initial therapy with pyridoxine monotherapy and if this is inadequate for symptom control then the addition of doxylamine is recommended. For patients who fail this combination, promethazine or dimenhydrinate can be substituted for doxylamine. After this point, if the patient is still experiencing nausea and vomiting, options include metoclopramide, trimethobenzamide, methylprednisolone or ondansetron. 4 Indications Diclegis\u00ae is indicated for the treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy in women who do not respond to conservative management.

Patients (N=298) were randomized to 14 days of placebo or two tablets daily at bedtime and up to a maximum dose of four tablets of Diclegis\u00ae (doxylamine succinate/pyridoxine hydrochloride).5 New Drug Review: doxylamine succinate/pyridoxine hydrochloride Page 2 of 8 Copyright 2016 Completed on 2/29/2016 The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline to day -15 in the symptom domain and the quality of life (QOL) domain of the Pregnancy Unique- Quantification of Emesis (PUQE) score. The symptom domain score incorporates the number of daily vomiting episodes, number of daily heaves, and length of daily nausea in hours, for an overall score of symptoms from 3 (no symptoms) to 15 (most severe). The QOL domain score incorporates patient's report of their present well -being from zero (worst possible) to 10 (best possible). 5 Treatment with Diclegis \u00ae (doxylamine succinate/pyridoxine hydrochloride) resulted in a statistically significant improvement in both the symptom and QOL domains of the PUQE score. There was a 4.8 point mean decrease from baseline in the symptom domain PUQE score at day 15 in the Diclegis \u00ae (doxylamine succinate/pyridoxine hydrochloride) group compared to 3.9 point decrease in the placebo group. For QOL, there was also a 2.8 point mean increase from baseline in the score at day 15 in the Diclegis \u00ae (doxylamine succinate/pyridoxine hydrochloride) group compared to a 1.8 point decrease in the placebo group.5 Secondary endpoints included the day -by-day area under the curve for change in PUQE from baseline, time loss from employment and the number of women in each arm who continued with blinded compassionate use of their medication. The number of patients who reported concurrent use of alternate therapy for nausea and vomiting were also recorded. Finally safety was examined. 5 The mean area under the curve of the change in PUQE from baseline was significantly larger with Diclegis\u00ae (doxylamine succinate/pyridoxine hydrochloride) than with placebo. There was also a trend toward more time lost from employment in the placebo group (2.37 days) compared to the Diclegis\u00ae (doxylamine succinate/pyridoxine hydrochloride) group (0.92); however, this difference was not statistically significant. 5 At the end of the 15 day trial, a significantly higher percentage of patients in the Diclegis \u00ae (doxylamine succinate/pyridoxine hydrochloride) group (48.9%) compared to in the placebo group (32.8%) requested to continue compassionate use of their medication. Significantly more patients receiving placebo (36%) requested alternate therapies for nausea and vomiting compared to the Diclegis \u00ae (doxylamine (doxylamine succinate/pyridoxine hydrochloride) group and placebo group, respectively, the most common treatment emergent adverse events included somnolence (14.5% vs 2%), dry 16.0%), and loss of consciousness (0% vs 0.8%). 5 A second study compared a five-day course of low -dose ondansetron to low -dose doxylamine/pyridoxine. The study concluded that ondansetron provided a statistically significant reduction in the nausea and vomiting (P=0.019 and P=0.049, respectively).

Clinical Guidelines Clinical Guideline Recommendations Clinical Management Guidelines For Obstetrician - Gynecologists ACOG Practice Bulletin: Nausea and Vomiting of Pregnancy (2004) 4 \u00b7 Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) is a common condition that affects 70 to 85% of pregnant women. \u00b7 The incidence of hyperemesis gravidarum is 0.5% to 2% of pregnancies. \u00b7 Mild cases of NVP may be resolved with lifestyle and dietary changes and sage and effective treatments are available for more severe cases. \u00b7 Symptoms of NVP manifest before week 9 of gestation in virtually all women. Non- Pharmacological Therapies: \u00b7 It is reasonable for women with NVP in a previous pregnancy to take a multivitamin at the time of the next conception. \u00b7 Common recommendation to alleviate initial signs and symptoms of NVP include rest and avoidance of sensory stimuli that may provoke symptoms. \u00b7 Frequent, small meals, avoiding spicy or fatty foods, eliminating pills containing iron, and eating dry bland or dry foods are also recommended. \u00b7 It should be noted however that there is little published evidence regarding the efficacy of dietary changes for prevention or treatment of NVP. Pharmacological Therapies: \u00b7 Despite the fact that the combination of doxylamine and pyridoxine is no longer commercially available in the US it remains among first -line therapies. \u00b7 Treatment with either pyridoxine or combination pyridoxine plus doxylamine are both recommended as firs t-line treatment options based on good and consistent scientific evidence (Level A). \u00b7 The treatment algorithm indicates that initial pharmacologic therapy consists of monotherapy pyridoxine followed by the addition of doxylamine New Drug Review: doxylamine succinate/pyridoxine hydrochloride (Diclegis\u00ae) \\ Page 7 of 8 Copyright 2016 Completed on 2/29/2016 Clinical Guideline Recommendations if systems persist. \u00b7 In patients with consistent symptoms promethazine or dimenhydrinate should be added. \u00b7 After this if symptoms still persist options include the addition of any of the following: o Metoclopramide o Promethazine o Trimethobenzamide \u00b7 For patients who continue to be refractory options include: o Methylprednisolone o Ondansetron Conclusions Diclegis\u00ae (doxylamine succinate/pyridoxine hydrochloride) is a fixed dose combination drug product of doxylamine succinate, and pyridoxine hydrochloride , a vitamin B6 analog. The agent is indicated for the treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy in women who do not responds to conservative management.1 The combination of these agents was previous available in the United States under the name brand Bendectin\u00ae.2 In the clinical study that evaluated the use of Diclegis\u00ae (doxylamine succinate/pyridoxine hydrochloride) compared to placebo the agent was found to be effective and well tolerated in relieving the symptoms of NVP. 5 Doxylamine/pyridoxine was show n to be less effective at reducing nausea and vomiting in pregnancy when compared with ondansetron; however, only the low doses were study for a short duration of time.6 The clinical consensus guideline on nausea and vomiting of pregnancy from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend pyridoxine alone or in combination with doxylamine as first line pharmacologic therapy. 4 New Drug Review: doxylamine succinate/pyridoxine hydrochloride (Diclegis\u00ae) \\ Page 8 of 8 Copyright 2016 Completed on References 1.

Page 1 of 5 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 3/4/2016 Therapeutic Class Overview Neurokinin- 1 (NK1) Receptor Antagonists and Combinations Therapeutic Class Overview/Summary: This review will focus on neurokin- 1 (NK 1) receptor antagonist anti-emetics and their combinations. All of these agents are Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -approved for the prevention of chemotherapy - induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). Single- entity products include: aprepitant (Varubi\u00ae). There is a single NK 1 antagonist combination product currently available, netupitant/palonosetron (Akynzeo\u00ae). With this combination, netupitant, the NK 1 antagonist is co- formulated with palonosetron, a serotonin type- 3 (5- HT3) receptor antagonist. In addition to CINV, aprepitant is FDA -approved for the prevention of post - operative nausea and vomiting in adults.1-4 Differences in anti -emetic effect for the acute and delayed phases of CINV exist between agents and are summarized in Table 1. As the pathophysiology of CINV is not completely understood, the exact mechanisms by which NK 1 antagonists exert there antiemetic effects are not known. NK 1 is a broadly distributed receptor located in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. One proposed mechanism of NK 1 antagonists is by depressing the substance P mediated response in the central nevous system by blocking activation of NK 1 in areas of the brain responsible for chemoreception. Decreased activation of NK 1 by substance P reduces the emetic reflex. A second proposed mechanism is the blockade of peripheral NK 1 receptors located on the vagal terminals of the gut. It is hypothesized that peripheral blockade may decrease the intensity of the signal transmitted to the central nervous system, thus decreasing the overall emetic reflex.1-6 Table 1.

Results of these trials are similar to those used by the FDA for approval.15-32 There are currently no clinical trials that compare NK 1 antagonists to one- another. \u00b7 The approval of rolapitant (Varubi\u00ae) was based on the efficacy and safety in preventing CINV in patients receiving anthracycline combination therapy, MEC, or HEC with a cisplatin- based regimen in three clinical trials. The primary endpoint in both HEC studies was complete response ( CR) in the delayed phase (defined as 25 to 120 hours post administration of chemotherapy) of CINV. Results of the showed a greater proportion of individuals treated with the rolapitant arm had a statistically significant CR compared with the placebo control group in HEC -1: (192 [73%] compared to 153 [58%]; P=0.0006). However, in HEC -2, this was statistically significant: (rolapitant [70%] compared to placebo control group [62%]; P=0.0426). 35,36 In the third trial, the antiemetic effect of rolapitant was evaluated in MEC . The primary endpoint of CR in the delayed phase of CINV showed a greater proportion of individuals treated with the rolapitant arm had a statistically significant CR compared with the placebo control group: (475 [71%] compared to 410 [62%]; P=0.0002). 35,37 \u00b7 The approval of netupitant/palonosetron (Akynzeo\u00ae) was based on the efficacy and safety in preventing CINV in patients receiving MEC or HEC. Both trials were double- blind, randomized, double- dummy, multicenter, parallel -group studies of netupitant/palonosetron given as a single oral dose 60 minutes before administration of chemotherapy in combination with dexamethasone. CR in the delayed phase was statically significant in HEC and MEC for patients who received netupitant/palonosetron (P=0.032 and P=0.01, respectively). 38,39 Key Points within the Medication Class \u00b7 According to Current Clinical Guidelines: o It is recommended that antiemetic therapy be initiated before the administration of chemotherapy and then continued throughout the period when delayed emesis may occur. Choice of antiemetic regimen depends primarily on the emetogenic potential and the risk of delayed CINV associated with the chemotherapy agents. The period of risk for CINV may be up to three days after administration of highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC) and at least two days after moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC). 7 o For the prevention of CINV post -HEC , triple therapy with a 5- HT3 receptor antagonist, dexamethasone, and a NK 1 receptor antagonist is recommended.7-8 o The updated 2015 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines do not currently recommend one specific regimen over another.7 o For the prevention of CINV post -MEC , a 5- HT3 receptor antagonist and dexamethasone is recommended, with a NK 1 receptor antagonist being optional.7-9 o Guidelines generally recommend palonosetron as the preferred 5- HT3 receptor antagonist for the prevention CINV associated with MEC. Adjunctive therapies include with lorazepam, an H2 receptor antagonist or a proton pump inhibitor.7-9 o The Pediatric Oncology Group of Ontario in 2012 recommend aprepitant in combination with granisetron and dexamethasone in children 12 years of age or older who will be receiving HEC and in which the antineoplastics are not known to or suspected of interacting with Therapeutic Class Overview: neurokinin-1 (NK1) receptor antagonists and combinations Page 3 of 5 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 3/4/2016 aprepitant. Dual therapy with ondansetron or granisetron and dexamethasone is recommended if the antineoplastic agents interact with aprepitant.10 o Several guidelines have not yet been updated to include netupitant/palonosetron and/or rolapit ant.8-10 \u00b7 Other Key Facts: o All agents are formulated as oral capsules or tablets, with the exception of fosaprepitant, which is an intravenous injection. o For HEC, fosaprepitant, rolapitant, and netupitant/palonosetron are given only on day one as a single dose, while aprepitant is given for three days. o All NK 1 antagonists are associated with drug interactions to some extent. Of particular concern are drug interactions with agents that are either substrates of CYP3A4 or inhibit/induce CYP3A4. Dose adjustments and contraindications may apply based on the concurrent agent. 1-4 o Aprepitant capsules are the only NK 1 antagonist currently approved by the FDA for use in pediatric patients. o Both the FDA -approved label and clinical guidelines do not recommend aprepitant for patients less than 12 years of age.1,10 o Due to it s co-formulation, netupitant/palonosetron carries the associated warnings of palonosetron, including a serotonin PJ.

All of these agents are Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -approved for the prevention of chemotherapy - induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) . Single (Varubi\u00ae). There is a single NK 1 antagonist combination product currently available, netupitant/palonosetron (Akynzeo\u00ae). With this combination, netupitant, the NK 1 co- formulated with a serotonin type- (5- HT3) addition to CINV, aprepitant is FDA -approved for the prevention of post - operative nausea and vomiting in adults.1-4 Differences in anti -emetic effect for the acute and delayed phases of CINV exist between agents and are summarized in Table 2.

Results of these trials are similar to those used by the FDA for approval .15-32 There are currently no clinical trials that compare NK 1 antagonists to one- another. The safety and efficacy of aprepitant (Emend\u00ae) was established in a number of clinical trials.11-14 FDA- approval for the prevention of CINV associated with HEC and MEC was based on the results of two clinical trials each. For approval of HEC, aprepitant for three days in combination with standard therapy (dexamethasone on days 1, 2, and three plus ondansetron on day 1) was compared to standard therapy plus place bo. The antiemetic activity of aprepitant was evaluated during the acute phase (0 to 24 hours post-cisplatin treatment), the delayed phase (25 to 120 hours post -cisplatin treatment) and overall (0 to 120 hours post -cisplatin treatment) in Cycle 1. The primary endpoint for both studies was complete response (CR) , defined as no emetic episodes and no use of rescue therapy as recorded in patient diaries. Both studies showed a statistically significant difference in CR favoring the aprepitant group (P<0.001).11,12 For the treatment of MEC, aprepitant was given for three days (in combination with dexamethasone and ondansetron on day 1) and was compared to standard therapy (dexamethasone on day 1 plus ondansetron on days 1, 2, and 3).13,14 The use of aprepitant was also evaluated in two clinical trials for the treatment of post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV).41-42 Here aprepitant 40 mg as a single dose was compare to ondansetron. The primary end- point in the first study was the percentage of patients with no vomiting over 0 to 24 hours. The aprepitant group had 84% of patients with no vomiting, while the ondansetron group had only 71% (P<0.001).41 The primary end- point of the second study was CR, defined as no vomiting and no use of rescue medication during 0 to 24 hours. There was no statistically significant difference between groups for CR (difference, 2.5%; P=0.61), however, there was a statistically significant difference in the secondary end- point of no vomiting from 0 to 24 hours (difference, 16.3%; P <0.001).42 The approval of rolapitant (Varubi \u00ae) was based on the efficacy and safety in preventing CINV in patients receiving anthracycline combination therapy, MEC, or HEC with a cisplatin- based regimen in three clinical trials. All of these phase III trials were double- blind, randomized, double- dummy, multicenter, parallel - group studies of rolapitant given as a single oral dose 60 to 120 minutes before administration of chemotherapy in combination with dexamethasone and granisetron. 35 The first two tri als HEC -1 (N=532) and HEC -2 (N=555) enrolled patients with cancer who were 18 years of age or older. These individuals received either a single oral dose of rolapitant (180 mg) in addition to intravenous (IV) granisetron and oral dexamethasone or placebo plus IV granisetron and oral dexamethasone. The primary endpoint in both studies was CR in the delayed phase (defined as 25 to 120 hours post administration of chemotherapy) of CINV. Results of the showed a greater proportion of individuals treated with the rolapitant arm had a statistically significant CR compared with the placebo control group in HEC -1: (192 [73%] compared to 153 [58%]; P=0.0006). However, in HEC -2, this was statistically significant: (rolapitant [70%] compared to placebo control group [62%]; P=0.0426). 35,36 In the third trial, 1,369 patients with cancer who were 18 years of age or older who had a Karnofsky performance score of 60 or higher, a predicted life expectancy of four months or longer and who were scheduled to receive a first course of MEC including anthracycline were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either a single oral dose of rolapitant (180 mg) in addition to oral granisetron (2 mg) and oral dexamethasone or placebo plus oral granisetron and oral dexamethasone. The primary e ndpoint of CR in the delayed phase of CINV showed a greater proportion of individuals treated with the rolapitant arm had a statistically significant CR compared with the placebo control group: (475 [71%] compared to 410 [62%]; P=0.0002). 35,37 The approval of netupitant/palonosetron (Akynzeo \u00ae) was based on the efficacy and safety in preventing CINV in patients receiving MEC or HEC. Both trials were double- blind, randomized, double- dummy, multicenter, parallel- group studies of netupitant/palonosetron given as a single oral dose 60 minutes before administration of chemotherapy in combination with dexamethasone. CR in the delayed phase was statically significant in HEC and MEC for patients who received netupitant/palonosetron (P=0.032 and P=0.01, respectively ). 38,39 Therapeutic Class Review: neurokinin- 1 receptor antagonists Page 4 of 41 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 3/4/2016 Table 4.

For the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting following chemotherapy of low emetic risk the following is recommended: \u00b7 A single 8 mg dose of dexamethasone before chemotherapy. For the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting following chemotherapy of minimal emetic risk the following is recommended: \u00b7 No antiemetic should be administered routinely to individuals before or after chemotherapy. Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) and European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO): Antiemetic Guideline (2013) 9 For the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting following chemotherapy of high emetic risk or a regimen of anthracycline plus cyclophosphamide the following is recommended: \u00b7 A three -drug regimen of single doses of a 5- HT3 receptor antagonist, dexamethasone and oral aprepitant 125 mg (or fosaprepitant 150 mg IV). \u00b7 For delayed emesis, it is recommended to give aprepitant 80 mg once daily for two days after chemotherapy (or none if fosaprepitant is used on Day 1). For the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting following chemotherapy of moderate emetic risk the following is recommended: \u00b7 Palonosetron plus a single IV dose of dexamethasone 8 mg. For the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting following chemotherapy of low emetic risk the following is recommended: \u00b7 A single antiemetic such as dexamethasone, a 5- HT3 receptor antagonist or a dopamine receptor antagonist, such as metoclopramide. For the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting following chemotherapy of minimal emetic risk the following is recommended: \u00b7 No antiemetic should be routinely administered to individuals without a history of nausea and vomiting. For patients receiving multiple- day cisplatin the following is recommended: \u00b7 A 5-HT3 receptor antagonist plus dexamethasone for acute nausea and vomiting and dexamethasone for delayed nausea and vomiting. \u00b7 The addition of an NK -1 receptor antagonist (aprepitant or fosaprepitant) could be considered starting no later than day three (optimal administration schedule not defined).

Conclusions The NK 1 antagonists are mostly utilized for the prevention CINV. Aprepitant (Emend\u00ae) and its prodrug fosaprepitant dimeglumine (Emend\u00ae) have been available for some time with n ewer agents such as rolapitant (Varubi\u00ae) and neutipitant/palonosetron (Akynzeo\u00ae) recently receiving FDA approval. In addition to CINV, aprepitant is FDA -approved for the prevention of post -operative nausea and vomiting in adults.1-4 It is recommended that antiemetic therapy be initiated before the administration of chemotherapy and then continued throughout the period when delayed emesis may occur. Choice of antiemetic regimen depends primarily on the emetogenic potential and the risk of delayed CINV associated with the chemotherapy agents. The period of risk for CINV may be up to three days after administration of highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC) and at least two days after moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC). 7 For the prevention of CINV post -HEC , triple therapy with a 5- HT3 receptor antagonist, dexamethasone, and a NK 1 receptor antagonist is recommended.7-8 The updated 2015 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines do not currently recommend one specific regimen over another.7 For the prevention of CINV post -MEC , a 5- HT3 receptor antagonist and dexamethasone is recommended, with a NK 1 receptor antagonist being optional.7-9 Most guidelines have not yet been updated to include netupitant/palonosetron and/or rolapitant.8-10 The safety and efficacy of the NK1 antagonists have been evaluated in several clinical trials for their FDA - approved indications.11-45 There are currently no clinical trials that compare two different NK 1 antagonist to each other. All agents are formulated as oral capsules or tablets, with the exception of fosaprepitant, which is an intravenous injection. For HEC, fosaprepitant, rolapitant, and netupitant/palon osetron are given only on day one as a single dose, while aprepitant is given for three days. All NK 1 antagonists are associated with drug interactions to some extent. Of particular concern are drug interactions with agents that are either substrates of CYP3A4 or inhibit/induce CYP3A4. Dose adjustments and contraindications may apply based on the concurrent agent. 1-4 Aprepitant capsules are the only NK 1 antagonist currently approved by the FDA for use in pediatric patients. Both the FDA -approved label and clinical guidelines do not recommend aprepitant for patients less than 12 years of age.1,10 Due to its co- formulation, netupitant/palonosetron carries the associated warnings of palonosetron, including a risk serotonin 2016 Feb.

Page 1 of 5 Copyright 2015 Review Completed on 02/29/2016 Therapeutic Class Overview Opioid Dependence Agents Overview/Summary : This review will focus on the partial opioid agonists and opioid antagonists. These agents are used alone or in combination in the treatment of opioid use disorder with several agents used for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) - approved for the treatment of opioid dependence.1-7 Naltrexone is also FDA- approved for Naloxone solution and naloxone auto- injector (Evzio\u00ae) are used for the emergency treatment of known or suspected opioid overdose, as manifested by respiratory and/or central nervous system depression.8-9 Buprenorphine is available as a sublingual tablet, buprenorphine/naloxone is available as sublingual tablet sublingual film and buccal film, and naltrexone is available as a tablet and extended- release suspension for injection. Naloxone is available as a vial for injection, prefilled syringe for injection and auto- injector solution (Evzio\u00ae)1-9 Products which contain buprenorphine are classified as Schedule III controlled subst ances.10 The transdermal and injectable formulations of buprenorphine, Butrans\u00ae and Buprenex\u00ae, respectively, are FDA-approved for use in the management of pain and will not be discussed within this review.11,12 Buprenorphine and buprenorphine/naloxone prefilled currently available generically. Buprenorphine is a partial opioid agonist at the -opioid receptor (associated with analgesia and dependence) and an antagonist at the -opioid receptor (related to dysphoria). Partial opioid agonists reach a ceiling effect at higher doses and will displace full opioid agonists from the -opioid receptor. Buprenorphine is associated with a lower abuse potential, a lower level of physical dependence and is safer in overdose when compared to full opioid agonists 1,4-7 are antagonists at Naloxone has measurable blood levels following sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone administration. However, due to naloxone's low oral bioavailability, there are no significant physiological or subjective differences when compared to the administration of buprenorphine alone. Following intramuscular or intravenous administration, buprenorphine/naloxone is associate d with symptoms of opioid withdrawal and dysphoria which is caused by a stronger affinity of naloxone for the opioid receptor compared to buprenorphine. 4-7 Therefore, the addition of naloxone to buprenorphine results in a decreased risk of diversion compared to buprenorphine monotherapy.10 Similarly, when naloxone alone is administered to a patient via intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous routes, reversal of opioid- related effects is expected. This includes respiratory and/or nevous system depression.8-9 Evzio\u00ae (naloxone injection) is a prefilled autoinjector designed to deliver 0.4 mg of naloxone per injection. The injection can be given intramuscularly or subcutaneously into the outer thigh and may be given through clothing, if necessary. In addition, the device has a retractable needle system that is designed to prevent needlesticks. Evzio \u00ae (naloxone injection) is designed to be administered by laypersons in the presence of a patient with an apparent opioid overdose. The autoinjector device gives electronic voice instructions to the caregiver, including instruction to seek emergency medical assistance after a dose is administered.9 The United States Substance Abuse and Mental Service Clinical Guideline for the Use of Buprenorphine in the Treatment of Opioid Addiction recommends the use of buprenorphine/naloxone for the induction, stabilization and maintenance phases of opioid addiction treatment for most patients. This guideline also notes that buprenorphine alone should be used for pregnant patients and for the induction therapy of patients who are transitioning from methadone treatment. 13 Naloxone is recommended as an appropriate emergency pharmacologic intervention for instances of opioid overdose. 14 Additionally, The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and American Medical Association are among some of the prominent medical organizations and advocacy groups that recognize naloxone as standard care for pharmacologic treatment of opioid overdose.16,17 Therapeutic Class Overview: Opioid Dependence Agents Page 2 of 5 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 02/29/2016 Table 1.

Evidence- based Medicine \u00b7 Buprenorphine and buprenorphine/naloxone significantly improve many different outcomes for patients with opioid dependence compared to placebo and no treatment, but are generally found to not be significantly different from one another. 20-30 , 41-48 Therapeutic Class Overview: Opioid Dependence Agents Page 3 of 5 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 02/29/2016 \u00b7 FDA-approval of buprenorphine buccal film (Bunavail\u00ae) (Zubsolv\u00ae) was via the 505(b)(2) pathway . Clinical and safety data for these medications is based on previously approved buprenorphine or buprenorphine/naloxone formulations .5,7 \u00b7 Buprenorphine has been compared to methadone in several clinical studies and reviewed in multiple meta- analyses. Overall, studies have demonstrated that buprenorphine- based therapy was as effective as methadone in the management of opioid dependence.22, 31-38 \u00b7 A meta -analysis of 1, 158 participants in 13 randomized trials compared oral naltrexone maintenance treatment to either placebo or non- medication. No difference was seen between the active and control groups in sustained abstinence or most other primary outcomes. o Considering only studies in which patient's adherence were strictly enforced, there was a statistically significant difference in retention and abstinence with naltrexone over non therapy (relative risk [ RR], 2.93; 95% CI, 1.66 to 5.18). 58 \u00b7 The and safety of Vivitrol\u00ae (naltrexone extended- release) for opioid dependence was evaluated in a 24 -week, placebo- controlled randomized control trial. The percentage of subjects achievi ng each observed percentage of opioid- free weeks was greater in the naltrexone extended release group compared to the placebo group. Complete abstinence (opioid- free at all weekly visits) was sustained by 23% of subjects in the placebo group compared with 36% of subjects in the naltrexone extended release group from Week 5 to Week 24.59 \u00b7 FDA-approval of Evzio\u00ae (naloxone injection) was based upon data from a bioavailability trial that compared Evzio\u00ae (naloxone injection) to naloxone given through a standard s yringe. Subjects were randomized to receive Evzio\u00ae (naloxone injection) or standard naloxone injection on day one. On day two, the subjects received the opposite treatment in order to evaluate the comparative bioavailability. The mean peak plasma concentration (C max), median times to peak plasma concentrations (T max), mean elimination half -life (T 1/2) and mean area under -the-curve (AUC) mere similar when Evizio\u00ae (naloxone injection) was compared to standard naloxone injections (P values not reported).60 Key Points within the Medication Class \u00b7 According to Current Clinical Guidelines: o The United States Substance Abuse and Mental Service Clinical Guideline for the Use of Buprenorphine in the Treatment of Opioid Addiction recommends the use of buprenorphine/naloxone for the induction, stabilization and maintenance phases of opioid addiction treatment for most patients. 13 o This guideline also notes that buprenorphine alone should be used for pregnant patients and for the induction therapy of patients who are transitioning from methadone treatment. 13 o Naloxone is recommended as an appropriate emergency pharmacologic intervention for instances of opioid overdose.14 o Naltrexone is generally reserved as an alternative regimen after buprenorphine- containing products and methadone.15 \u00b7 Other Key Facts: o According to the Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000, the ability to prescribe buprenorphine or buprenorphine/naloxone for the maintenance or detoxification of opioid dependence is limited to physicians who have obtained a waiver and a unique Drug Enforcement Agency number beginning with an X. 18 o Naltrexone e xtended- release suspension for injection is injected intramuscularly in the gluteal muscle every 4 weeks by a healthcare provider.3 References 1.

Therapeutic Class Review: Opioid Dependence Agents Page 1 of 47 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 02/29/2016 Therapeutic Class Review Opioid Dependence Agents Overview/Summary This review will focus on the partial opioid agonists and opioid antagonists. These agents are used alone or in combination in the treatment of opioid use disorder with several agents used for the (FDA )-approved for the treatment of opioid dependence.1-7 Naltrexone is also FDA- approved for use dependence.2,3 Naloxone solution and naloxone auto -injector (Evzio\u00ae) are used for the emergency treatment of known or suspected opioid overdose, as manifested by respiratory and/or central nervous system depression.8-9 Buprenorphine is available as a sublingual tablet, buprenorphine/naloxone is available as sublingual tablet sublingual film and buccal film, and naltrexone is available as a tablet and extended- release suspension for injection. Naloxone is available as a vial for injection, prefilled syringe for injection and auto- injector solution (Evzio\u00ae)1-9 Products which contain buprenorphine are classified as Schedu le III controlled substances.10 The transdermal and injectable formulations of buprenorphine, Butrans\u00ae and Buprenex\u00ae, respectively, are FDA-approved for use in the management of pain and will not be discussed within this review .11,12 Buprenorphine and buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual tablets s and prefilled syringes are currently available generically. Buprenorphine is a partial opioid agonist at the -opioid receptor (associated with analgesia and dependence) and an antagonist at the -opioid receptor (related to dysphoria). 1,4-7 Compared to full opioid agonists, partial agonists bind to the -opioid receptor at a higher degree while activating the receptor to a lesser degree. Partial opioid agonists reach a ceiling effect at higher doses and will displace full opioid agonists from the -opioid receptor. Although buprenorphine is associated with significant respiratory depression when used intravenously, or by patients with concomitant benzodiazepine or alcoho l abuse, it is associated with a lower abuse potential, a lower level of physical dependence and is safer in overdose when compared to full opioid agonists.13 During buprenorphine administration, opioid- dependent patients experience positive subjective opioid effects which are limited by ceiling effect .4-7 Naloxone and naltrexone a re antagonist s at the -opioid receptor . 2-9 Naloxone has measurable blood levels following sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone administration. However, due to naloxone's low oral bioavailability, there are no significant physiological or subjective differences when compared to the administration of buprenorphine alone. Following intramuscular or intravenous administration, buprenorphine/naloxone is associated with symptoms of opioid withdrawal and dysphoria which is caused by a stronger affinity of naloxone for the opioid receptor compared to buprenorphine. 4-7 Therefore, the addition of naloxone to buprenorphine results in a decreased risk of diversion compared to buprenorphine monotherapy.10 Similarly, when naloxone alone is administered to a patient via intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous routes, reversal of opioid- related effects is expected. This includes respiratory and/or nevous system depression.8-9 Evzio\u00ae (naloxone injection) is a prefilled autoinjector designed to deliver 0.4 mg of naloxone per injection. The injection can be given intramuscularly or subcutaneously into the outer thigh. Evzio \u00ae (naloxone injection) may be given through clothing, if necessary, and the device has a retractable needle system that is designed to prevent needlesticks. Each carton of Evzio\u00ae (naloxone injection) contains two autoinjector devices and a trainer that may be reused for repeat training purposes. 9 Evzio\u00ae (naloxone injection) is designed to be administered by laypersons in the presence of a patient with an apparent opioid overdose. The autoinjector device gives electronic voice instructions to the caregiver, including instruction to seek emergency medical assistance after a dose is administered. The electronic voice instructions also instruct caregivers to take the Evzio \u00ae (naloxone injection) to the patient's physician for proper disposal and a refill of the medication after a dose is used. Should the electronic voice instructions fail to work, each autoinjector has printed instructions on the label of the device. If used according to the printed instructions on the device label, the Evzio \u00ae (naloxone injection) autoinjector will still deliver the necessary dose of naloxone, even if the electronic voice instructions fail to properly function. 9 Therapeutic Class Review: Opioid Dependence Agents Page 2 of 47 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 02/29/2016 The United States Substance Abuse and Mental Service Clinical G uideline for the Use of Buprenorphine in the Treatment of Opioid Addiction recommends the use of buprenorphine/naloxone for the induction, stabilization and maintenance phases of opioid addiction treatment for most patients. This guideline also notes that buprenorphine alone should be used for pregnant patients and for the induction therapy of patients who are transitioning from methadone treatment.13 Transitioning patients to buprenorphine/naloxone as early as possible to minimize potential diversion associated with buprenorphine monotherapy is also reccomended.13 Veterans Health Administration and American Psychiatric Association guidelines outline a similar strategy with methadone and buprenorphine first line.14-15 Only the American Psychiatric Association guidelines recommend naltrexone use as an alternative regimen.15 Naloxone is recommended as an appropriate emergency pharmacologic intervention for instances of opioid overdose.14 Additionally, The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and American Medical Association are among some of the prominent medical organizations and advocacy groups that recognize naloxone as standard care for pharmacologic treatment of opioid overdose. 16,17 According to the Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000, the ability to prescribe buprenorphine or buprenorphine/naloxone for the maintenance or detoxification of opioid dependence is limited to physicians who have obtained a waiver and a unique Drug Enforcement Agency number beginning with an X.18 Medications Table 1.

Clinical Trials The safety and efficacy of buprenorphine, buprenorphine/naloxone and naltrexone in the treatment of opioid dependence were demonstrated in several clinical trials outlined in Table 4.19-59 FDA-approval of Evzio\u00ae (naloxone injection) was based upon data from a bioavailability trial that compared Evzio\u00ae (naloxone injection) to naloxone 0.4 mg given through a standard syringe. Additionally, an ease of use study was conducted for Evzio\u00ae (naloxone injection).60 In the study in which approval of Evzio \u00ae (naloxone injection) was based upon, bioavailability of Evzio\u00ae (naloxone injection) was compared to naloxone 0.4 mg given through a standard syringe in 30 healthy subjects. Subjects were randomized to receive Evzio\u00ae (naloxone injection) or standard naloxone injection on day one. On day two, the subjects received the opposite treatment in order to evaluate the comparative bioavailability. The mean peak plasma concentration (C max) for Evzio\u00ae (naloxone injection) was 1,240 pg/mL, versus a C max of 1,070 pg/mL for standard naloxone injection. Median times to peak plasma concentrations for Evzio\u00ae (naloxone injection) and standard naloxone injection were 0.25 hour and 0.33 hour, respectively. The mean elimination half -life (T1/2) for Evzio\u00ae (naloxone injection) was 1.28 hours, versus a mean T 1/2 of 1.36 hours for standard naloxone injection. The mean area under -the-curve (AUC) for Evzio\u00ae (naloxone injection) was 1,930 pghr/mL, AUC for standard naloxone injection was 1,980 pghr/mL.60 In addition to the bioavailability study, an ease of use study was conducted for Evzio \u00ae (naloxone injection) in order to evaluate the ability of laypersons to administer a successful injection. The study evaluated the ability of 20 English- speaking participants aged 12 to 19 years and 20 English- speaking participants aged 20 to 65 years to administer a simulated dose of Evzio \u00ae (naloxone injection). The participants were not previously trained to use the Evzio\u00ae (naloxone injection) system, and relied upon the voice commands for use instructions. Of the 40 participants, 36 participants (90%) were able to successfully deliver an effective dose of naloxone from the Evzio\u00ae (naloxone injection) device. Of the four participants that failed to deliver the dose, two did not press the base of injector firmly enough to activate the autoinjector. One participant did not hold the autoinjector in place for a full second, and the other participant that failed to deliver an effective naloxone dose used the Evzio\u00ae (naloxone injection) training unit, rather than the unit with active medication. The average time to give the injection was 64.0 seconds for the adult cohort and 57.6 seconds for the juvenile (12 to 29 years of age) cohort. 60 Studies have shown that in adult patients with opioid dependence, the percentage of opioid negative urine test s was significantly higher for both buprenorphine 16 mg daily and buprenorphine/naloxone 16/4 mg daily compared to placebo, while no significant difference was seen between the two active treatment Therapeutic Class Review: Opioid Dependence Agents Page 4 of 47 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 02/29/2016 groups.20-21 A smaller, randomized controlled trial (N=32) also showed no significant difference in withdrawal symptoms between buprenorphine and buprenorphine/naloxone.22 FDA-approval (Zubsolv\u00ae) was via the 505(b)(2) pathway, which allows a manufacturer to compare a new product to a previously - approved drug (or drugs) and utilize data from studies that were performed on the reference drug. These medications have not been specifically studied in clinical trials evaluating their efficacy. Clinical and safety data for these medications is based on previously approved buprenorphine or buprenorphine/naloxone formulations. 5,7 Several studies have compared the effectiveness of short -term detoxification to medium - or long- term maintenance treatment with buprenorphine monotherapy or buprenorphine/naloxone. Three studies have shown higher treatment retention rate or lower self -reported drug use with longer treatment duration compared to detoxification; however, one of the studies (Woody et al) showed no significant difference in the percentage of positive urine tests between the two treatment groups at 12 weeks. 23-25 A cost - effectiveness analysis showed that compared to two- week detoxification, a 12- week outpatient treatment program with buprenorphine/naloxone was associated with an incremental first -year direct medical cost of $1,376 per quality -adjusted life year and had an 86% chance of being accepted as cost -effective for a threshold of $100,000 per quality -adjusted life year.26 In a meta- analysis of 21 randomized controlled trials, buprenorphine at doses 16 mg/day was demonstrated to be more likely to retain in treatment compared to doses <16 mg/day; however, no significant difference was seen in the percentage of opioid positive urine tests between the high and low dose groups. 27 Studies that compared different dosing regimens of buprenorphine showed no differences in rate of treatment retention, percentage of urine tests positive for opioids or withdrawal symptoms.28-31 Buprenorphine has been compared to methadone in several clinical studies and reviewed in multiple meta- analyses. Overall, studies have demonstrated that buprenorphine- based therapy was as effective as methadone in the management of opioid dependence.22, 2 31-38 However, when low doses of buprenorphine mg/day), high doses more efficacious.29, 39 -41 A meta -analysis of 1, 158 participants in 13 randomized trials compared oral naltrexone maintenance treatment to either placebo or non- medication. No difference was seen between the active and control groups in sustained abstinence or most other primary outcomes. Considering only studies in which patient's adherence were strictly enforced, there was a statistically significant difference in retention and abstinence with naltrexone over non therapy (relative risk [RR], 2.93; 95% CI, 1.66 to 5.18. 58 The safety of Vivitrol\u00ae (naltrexone extended- release) for opioid dependence was evaluated in a 24- week , placebo- controlled randomized control trial. The percentage of subjects achieving each observed percentage of opioid- free weeks was greater in the naltrexone extended release group compared to the placebo group. Complete abstinence (opioid- free at all weekly visits) was sustained by 23% of subjects in the placebo group compared with 36% of subjects in the naltrexone extended release group from Week 5 to Week 24. 59 Therapeutic Class Review: Opioid Dependence Agents Page 5 of 47 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 02/29/2016 Table 4.

For each of the four study weeks, the mean scores for opioid craving in the combined- treatment and buprenorphine groups were significantly lower than those in the placebo group ( P<0.001 for both comparisons each week). Secondary: Each week scores for patients' and clinicians' global impression were significantly higher in both the combined treatment group and buprenorphine alone group than those in the placebo group (P<0.001 for both comparisons each week). The overall rate of adverse events did not differ significantly among the groups (78% in the combined treatment group, 85% in the buprenorphine only group and 80% in the placebo group). The only adverse events that showed a significant difference in occurrences between treatment groups and placebo were withdrawal syndrome, constipation and diarrhea.

Patients preferred buprenorphine/naloxone over buprenorphine with regard to tablet size (6.83 to 7.02 vs 5.29 to 5.76; P=0.151), tablet taste (6.83 to 6.98 vs 2.45 to 2.74; P=0.57) and SL dissolution time (6.62 to 6.84 vs 3.73 to 3.92; P=0.751), though no statistical significance was reached. On day five, 54 and 31% of patients indicated preference to buprenorphine/naloxone and buprenorphine, respectively. Fifteen percent of patients indicated that they had no preference ( P value not reported). Seventy -one percent of patients also indicated that they would like to continue treatment with buprenorphine/naloxone. Patients were more likely to want to continue treatment with buprenorphine/naloxone if they had a history of injecting buprenorphine. Twenty -three adverse events were reported during study period. The most commonly reported adverse events were fatigue, hyperhidrosis, diarrhea and headache.

MC, RCT Patients 18 years of age who met DSM -IV criteria for opioid dependence and who were seeking treatment Phase 1 N=653 12 weeks Phase 2 N=360 24 weeks Primary: Percentage of patients achieving successful outcome Secondary: Adverse events Primary: In Phase 1, successful outcome was defined by self -reported opioid use on no more than four days in a month, absence of two consecutive opioid- positive urine test results, no additional substance use disorder treatment and no more than one missing urine sample during the past 12 weeks. Overall, 43 of 653 patients (6.6%) had successful outcome with brief buprenorphine/naloxone treatment. In Phase 2, successful outcome was defined by abstinence from opioids during week 12 and at least two of the previous three weeks (during weeks nine to 11). One hundred and seventy -seven of 360 patients (49.2%) achieved successful outcome in the extended buprenorphine/naloxone treatment. However, the success rate at week 24 dropped to 8.6% (P<0.001 compared to week 12). No differences were seen between patients who received standard medical management and those who received additional opioid dependence counseling. Secondary: The most common adverse events were headache, constipation, insomnia, nasopharyngitis and nausea. Twelve and 24 serious adverse events were reported in Phase 1 and 2, respectively.

The point estimate for the incremental direct medical costs during the first year was $83 higher with the 12- week treatment ( P=0.97). During the first year since the start of treatment, patients who received 12-weeks of treatment had an increase in opioid- free years by 0.27 year (P<0.001) and an increase in QALY by 0.06 year ( P=0.08) compared to those who received two- week detoxification. The incremental one- year direct medical cost per QALY was $1,376 for the 12- week treatment program. The outpatient treatment program cost per QALY was $25,049. The incremental one- year direct medical cost per opioid- free year was $308, and the outpatient treatment program cost per opioid- free year was $5,610. The acceptability curve suggested that the cost -effectiveness ratio of 12- week treatment relative to two- week treatment has an 86% chance of being accepted as cost -effective for a threshold of $100,000 per QALY. Secondary: During the first year, total net social cost, which included total direct medical costs, were lower by $31,264 for the 12- week group compared to the two- week group (P=0.2).

In four studies, duration of withdrawal treatment was significantly shorter with buprenorphine by 0.92 day compared to clonidine (95% CI, 0.57 to 1.27; P<0.001). Completion of treatment was shown to be more likely with buprenorphine compared to clonidine in eight studies (RR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.31 to 2.06; P<0.001; NNT, 4). Comparison of different rates of buprenorphine taper Two studies showed no significant difference in withdrawal severity between groups of different rates of buprenorphine dose reduction. One study showed greater patient -rated severity with the rapid taper group but no difference in observers' assessment. Another study showed that patients in the rapid taper group but not the gradual taper group reported muscle aches and insomnia. A third study showed that peak withdrawal occurred earlier with the rapid taper group. Duration of treatment was shown to be shorter with the rapid taper group than the gradual taper group (9 vs 28 days; P value not reported) but not significantly different in the other study (9.5\u00b11.8 vs 9.8\u00b10.9 days; P>0.05).

The risk of death increased 8 to 9- fold in the month immediately after the end of opiate substitution therapy, which did not vary according to medication, dosing within standard thresholds, or planned cessation. Therapeutic Class Review: Opioid Dependence Agents Page 29 of 47 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 02/29/2016 Study and Drug Regimens Study Design and Demographics Sample Size and Study Duration End Points Results There was no difference in the overall mortality rate between patients who received methadone and those who received buprenorphine. Secondary: Substitution therapy has a greater than 85% chance of reducing overall mortality when average duration of treatment is at least 12 months.

The predominant effects were seen with the highest doses tested (hydromorphone 4 mg, buprenorphine/ naloxone 8 /2 and 16 /4 mg, and buprenorphine 8 and 16 mg). None of the treatments produced significant changes in ratings of Bad Effects or Sick. For ratings of Drug Effects, only the two higher doses of buprenorphine alone (8 and 16 mg) produced significantly increased ratings compared to placebo ( P<0.05 and P<0.01, respectively). The combination dose of 8 -2 mg and 16- 4 produced ratings of drug effects that were lower than those produced by the buprenorphine dose of 8 mg. T he differences between buprenorphine alone and buprenorphine/ naloxone doses were not statistically significant for these or any other measures. None of the treatments produced significant changes on measures of blood pressure, heart rate, or respiratory rate. There were no significant differences in psychomotor effects among the treatments.

Considering only studies in which patient's adherence were strictly enforced, there was a statistically significant difference in retention and abstinence with naltrexone over non therapy (RR, 2.93; 95% CI, 1.66 to 5.18). There was no statically significant difference in the two outcomes considered between naltrexone and psychotherapy (one study). Naltrexone was not superior to benzodiazepines and to buprenorphine for retention and abstinence and side effects (one study).

Clinical Guidelines Clinical Guideline Recommendations United States Substance Abuse and Mental Services Center for Substance Abuse Treatment: Clinical G uidelines for the Use of Buprenorphine in the Treatment of O pioid Addiction (2004) 13 \u00b7 Buprenorphine/naloxone should be used for the induction, stabilization and maintenance phases of treatment for most patients. \u00b7 Induction doses should be administered as observed treatment; however, subsequent doses may be obtained with a prescription. \u00b7 In most patients, buprenorphine/naloxone can be used for induction. If buprenorphine monotherapy is used, patients should be transitioned to buprenorphi ne/naloxone after no more than two days of treatment. If buprenorphine monotherapy is to be used for extended periods, the number of doses to be prescribed should be limited, and the use of the monotherapy formulation should be justified in the medical record. \u00b7 Buprenorphine/naloxone or buprenorphine should only be used in patients dependent on long -acting opioids who have evidence of sustained medical and psychosocial stability in conjunction with opioid treatment programs. In these patients, buprenorphine monotherapy should be utilized during the induction phase to avoid precipitation of withdrawal. \u00b7 For patients taking methadone, the methadone dose should be tapered to \u00a330 mg/day for at least one week and patients should have taken their last dose of methadone \u00b324 hours prior to initiating buprenorphine induction. The first dose of buprenorphine should be 2 mg of the monotherapy formulation. If a patient develops signs or symptoms of withdrawal after the first dose, a second dose of 2 mg should be administered and repeated as needed to a maximum of 8 mg of buprenorphine on day one. The decision to transfer a patient, exhibiting withdrawal symptoms, from methadone at doses >30 mg/day to buprenorphine should be based on a physician's judgment as there is insufficient data in this patient population. \u00b7 Patients who are experiencing objective signs of opioid withdrawal and whose last use of a short -acting opioid were at least 12 to 24 hours prior, should be inducted using buprenorphine/naloxone. Patients should receive a first dose of 4/1 to 8/2 mg of the buprenorphine/naloxone combination. If the initial dose of the combination treatment is 4/1 mg and opioid withdrawal symptoms subside but then return (or are still present) after two hours, a second dose of 4/1 mg may be administered. The total amount of buprenorphine administered in the first day should not exceed 8 mg. \u00b7 If patients do not exhibit withdrawal symptoms after the first day of induction, the patient's daily dose should be equivalent to the total Therapeutic Class Review: Opioid Dependence Agents Page 41 of 47 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 02/29/2016 Clinical Guideline Recommendations amount of buprenorphine/nal oxone (or buprenorphine) that was administered on d ay one. Doses may be subsequently increased in 2g/0.5 to 4 /1 mg increments daily, if needed for symptomatic relief, with a target dose of 12/3 to 16/4 mg per day within the first week. \u00b7 Patients experiencing withdrawal symptoms on day two should receive an initial dose of buprenorphine/naloxone equivalent to the total amount of buprenorphine administered on day one plus 4/1 mg (maximum initial dose of 12/3 mg). If withdrawal symptoms are still present two hours after the dose, an additional 4 mg/1 mg dose can be administered. The total dose on day two should not exceed 16/4 mg. Continue dose increases on subsequent days as needed. \u00b7 The stabilization phase begins when patients are free of withdrawal symptoms and cravings. Most patients will stabili ze on daily doses of 16/4 to 24/6 mg; however , doses up to a maximum of 32/8 mg daily may be required in some patients. \u00b7 During stabilization, patients receiving maintenance treatment should be seen at least weekly. Once a stable buprenorphine dose is reached and toxicologic samples are free of illicit opioids, less frequent visits (biweekly or monthly ) may be an option. Toxicology tests for il licit drugs should be administered at least monthly. \u00b7 The longest phase of treatment is the maintenance phase which may be indefinite. Decisions to decrease or discontinue buprenorphine should be based on a patient commitment to being medication- free and on physician judgment . \u00b7 Patients treated for opioid withdrawal should receive psychosocial therapy (e.g. , individual or group counseling, self -help programs, and patient monitoring) and have their medical comorbidities managed effectively. \u00b7 Buprenorphine monotherapy may be used for medically supervised withdrawal. \u00b7 Detoxification in short -acting opioid addiction can be rapid (three days), moderate (10 to14 days) or long term (indefinite) . Buprenorphine long term therapy may be more effective than rapid detoxification from short - acting opioid abuse. \u00b7 In pregnant women, methadone is currently the standard of care; however , if this option is unavailable or refused by the patient , buprenorphine may be considered as an alternative. Although the Suboxone \u00ae and Subutex\u00ae product information advises against use in breast -feeding, the effects on the child would be minimal and buprenorphine use in breast -feeding is not contraindicated in this patient population. \u00b7 In adolescents and young adults , buprenorphine is a useful option; however, the practitioner should be familiar with the state laws regarding parental consent. \u00b7 In geriatric patients , the literature is lacking; however , due to differences in metabolism and absorption, additional care should be exercised when treating these patients. \u00b7 In instances of polysubstance abuse, buprenorphine may not have a beneficial effect on the use of other drugs. Extra care should be employed in patients who abuse alcohol or benzodiazepines due to the potential ly fatal interactions with buprenorphine. \u00b7 Patients who need treatment for pain but not for addiction should be treated within the context of a medical or surgical setting and should not Therapeutic Class Review: Opioid Dependence Agents Page 42 of 47 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 02/29/2016 Clinical Guideline Recommendations be transferred to an opioid maintenance program just because they have become physically dependant throughout the course of medical treatment. \u00b7 Pain, in patients receiving buprenorphine for opioid addiction, should be treated with short -acting opioid pain relievers and buprenorphine should be held. Sufficient time for these medications to be cleared must be allowed before restarting the buprenorphine. Patients with chronic severe pain may not be good candidates for buprenorphine because of the ceiling effect. \u00b7 In patients recently discharged from controlled environments, intensive monitoring is required, and treating physicians may be called upon to verify and explain treatment regimens, to document patient compliance and to interact with the legal system, employers, and others. These patients may be candidates for buprenorphine treatment even if there is no current opioid abuse. The lowest dose possible of buprenorphine/naloxone should be used (2/0.5 mg). \u00b7 Opioid addiction in health care professionals requires specialized, extended care since opioid addiction is an occupati onal hazard. Veterans Health Administration, Department of Defense: Clinical Practice Guideline for Management of Substance Use Disorders (2009)14 General considerations \u00b7 Opioid agonist treatment is the first -line treatment for chronic opioid dependence. \u00b7 Provide access to opioid agonist treatment for all opioid dependent patients, under appropriate medical supervision and with concurrent addition- focused psychosocial treatment. \u00b7 Strongly recommend methadone or sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone maintenance as first -line therapy. Buprenorphine monotherapy is preferred in pregnancy. \u00b7 By administering an opioid to prevent withdrawal, reduce craving, and reduce the effects of illicit opioids, the opioid- dependent patient is able to focus more readily on recovery activities. Opioid agonist treatment program and office- based opioid treatment \u00b7 Opioid agonist treatment should be administered in an opioid agonist treatment program or office -based opioid treatment. \u00b7 Doses should be adjusted to maintain a therapeutic range between signs/symptoms of overmedication and opioid withdrawal. \u00b7 The usual dosage range for optimal effects is 60 to 120 mg/day. \u00b7 Buprenorphine target dose is generally up to 16 mg/day; doses >32 mg are rarely indicated. \u00b7 In all cases (except pregnancy), the combination product of buprenorphine/naloxone should be used. Methadone therapy \u00b7 Methadone for the treatment of opioid dependence may only be prescribed out of an accredited opioid agonist treatment program as it is a schedule II agent. It is illegal to prescribe methadone for the treatment of opioid dependence out of an office- based practice. \u00b7 For newly admitted patients, the initial dose of methadone should not exceed 30 mg and the total dose for the first day should not exceed 40 mg, without provider documentation that 40 mg did n't reduce withdrawal \u00b7 Under usual practices, a stable, target dose is greater than 60 mg/day and most patients will require considerably higher doses in order to achieve a pharmacological blockade of reinforcing effects of Therapeutic Class Review: Opioid Dependence Agents Page 43 of 47 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 02/29/2016 Clinical Guideline Recommendations exogenously administered opioids. Buprenorphine therapy \u00b7 Office -based treatment with sublingual buprenorphine for opioid dependence can only be provided by physicians who have received a waiver from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and have a special Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) number. \u00b7 Buprenorphine induction (~1 week) involves helping a patient in the process of switching from the opioids of abuse to buprenorphine. \u00b7 In all cases (except pregnancy), the combination product of buprenorphine/naloxone should be used. \u00b7 The initial dose of buprenorphine/naloxone combination is between 2/0.5 mg to 4/1 mg, which can be repeated after two hours. The amount of buprenorphine administered in the first day should not exceed 8 mg. \u00b7 The daily buprenorphine/naloxone dose is the equivalent to the total amount of buprenorphine/naloxone (or buprenorphine) that was administered on day one. Doses may be increased as needed for symptomatic relief, with a target dose of 12/3 mg to 16/4 mg per day to be achieved within the first week. American Psychiatric Association: Practice Guideline for Treatment of Patients with Substance Use Disorders (2006) 15 Treating dependence and abuse \u00b7 Goals of therapy are to identify stable maintenance dose of opioid agonist and facilitate rehabilitation. \u00b7 The choice of treatment for opioid dependence is based on patient preference, past response to treatment, probability of achieving and maintaining abstinence, and assessment of the short - and long- term effects of continued use of illicit opioids on the patient's life adjustment and overall health status. \u00b7 Maintenance treatment with methadone or buprenorphine is appropriate for patients with \u00b3 1 year history of opioid dependence. Maintenance therapy with naltrexone is an alternative strategy. \u00b7 Methadone is a full mu agonist opioid, and is the most thorou ghly studied and widely used agent for opioid dependence. \u00b7 Methadone maintenance treatment for opioid- dependent individuals has generally been shown to be effective in: o Decreasing illicit opioid use. o Decreasing psychosocial and medical morbidity. o Improving overall health status. o Decreasing mortality. o Decreasing criminal activity. o Improving social functioning. o Reducing the spread of Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection among intravenous drug users. \u00b7 Maintenance on methadone is generally safe; however, one ke y issue is determining a dose sufficient to suppress the patient's opioid withdrawal and craving, as no single dose is optimal for all patients. \u00b7 Methadone can be diverted for abuse, as can other opiates that have agonist effects at the mu receptor. \u00b7 Buprenorphine produces a partial agonist effect at the mu receptor and an antagonistic effect at the kappa receptor. \u00b7 Buprenorphine enters the systemic circulation more slowly through the sublingual route than with parenteral administration and has less abuse potential compared to the par enterally delivered form. Therapeutic Class Review: Opioid Dependence Agents Page 44 of 47 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 02/29/2016 Clinical Guideline Recommendations \u00b7 The combination of buprenorphine and naloxone significantly reduces the risk of diversion because naloxone will exert a potent opioid antagonist effect if the combination tablet is crushed and administered intravenous by an opioid- dependent person. Naloxone has poor sublingual bioavailability. \u00b7 Buprenorphine is generally safe. Overdose with buprenorphine generally does not produce significant respiratory depression Treating intoxication \u00b7 Mild to moderate opioid intoxication usually does not require specific therapy. \u00b7 Severe opioid toxicity, marked by respiratory depression, is a medical emergency. Naloxone will reverse respiratory depression and other overdose manifestations. Treating withdrawal \u00b7 Treatment of withdrawal is directed at safely decreasing acute symptoms and easing transition into a long- term treatment program. \u00b7 Effective strategies include: o Substitution of opioid with methadone or buprenorphine. o Abrupt discontinuation of opioids, with use of clonidine to suppress withdrawal symptoms. o Clonidine -naltrexone detoxification. Conclusions Buprenorphine, buprenorphine/naloxone and naltrexone are treatment options for opioid dependent patients who are unable or unwilling to receive clinic -based methadone treatment. Naloxone alone is used for the treatment of opioid overdose. Buprenorphine is available as a sublingual tablet, and buprenorphine/naloxone is available as sublingual tablet and film . Naltrexone is available as a tablet or extended- release suspension for injection. Naloxone alone is available as a solution in vials or prefilled syringes and also in available generically.1-9 Physicians prescribing buprenorphine for opioid dependency in an office -based treatment setting are required to complete a training program as outlined in the Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000.18 Evzio\u00ae (naloxone injection) is designed to be administered by laypersons in the presence of a patient with an apparent opioid overdose. Two injections are provided in each package of Evzio\u00ae (naloxone injection), should the patient require a second injection before emergency medical services arrive. Results of clinical trials vary, but generally buprenorphine and buprenorphine/naloxone are considered equally effective and significantly improve outcomes compared to placebo when used for opioid withdrawal. 20-30 ,341-48 A meta- analysis evaluated naltrexone compared to non- therapy, and found no significant difference in outcomes. However, when considering only studies in which patient's adherence were strictly enforced, there was a statistically significant difference in retention and abstinence w ith RR of 2.93 (95% CI, 1.66 to 5.18).58 The percentage of subjects achieving each observed percentage of opioid- free weeks was greater in the naltrexone extended release group compared to the placebo group.59 Therapeutic Class Review: Opioid Dependence Agents Page 45 of 47 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 02/29/2016 References 1.

Page 1 of 3 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 02/29/ 2016 Therapeutic Class Overview Opioid -Induced Constipation Agents Therapeutic Class Overview/Summary: There are currently three agents approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of opioid- the treatment of OIC in adults with chronic non- cancer pain. Additionally, methylnaltrexone bromide is also FDA -approved for use in adults with OIC who have advanced illness and are receiving palliative care.1-3 While lubiprostone is also indicated for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation, and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation, those indications will not be covered in this review. Opioids are an effective and widely used treatment option to help control many different types of pain. Constipation, which can sometimes be severe, is a common side- effect of opioid use and may limit their acceptability.4 The cause of constipation associated with opioid use is thought to occur due to multiple etiologies. One factor is the ability of opioids to bind to the - and - opioid receptors found on smooth muscle within the gastrointestinal tract. This decreases peristalsis in the small intestine and colon by relaxing the intestinal smooth muscles and preventing normal bowel elimination functions. In addition, opioids are thought to interfere with normal fluid and electrolyte levels within the gastrointestinal lumen due to this longer gastrointestinal transit time that causes excessive water and electrolyte reabsorption from feces. 5 Agents used for the treatment of OIC work via one of two mechanisms. Lubiprostone is a locally acting chloride channel activator that enhances a chloride- rich intestinal fluid secretion without altering sodium and potassium concentrations in the serum. Lubiprostone acts by specifically activating the chloride channel -2 (CIC -2), which is a normal constituent of the apical membrane of the human intestine. By increasing intestinal fluid secretion, lubiprostone increases motility of the intestine, thereby increasing the passage of stool and alleviating symptoms of constipation. 1 Methylnaltrexone bromide and naloxegol oxalate are selective -opioid antagonists that prevent the peripher al activation of -opioid receptors in certain tissues, such as the gastrointestinal tract, thus reducing the constipation side- effect. At therapeutic doses, neither agent interferes with the analgesic activity of opioids, which is caused by activation of - opioid receptors within the central nervous system (CNS).2-3 Methylnaltrexone bromide is a quaternary amine, which increases its polarity, and helps prevents its penetration into the CNS.2 Naloxegol oxalate is a PEGylated derivative of naloxone, and is a substrate for the P -glycoprotein transporter (P -gp). The presence of a polyethylene glycol (PEG) moiety reduces its passive permeability into the CNS while being a substrate for P- gp increases efflux of naloxegol across the blood- brain barrer. 3 Table 1.

In all three studies, patients had documented opioid- induced constipation at baseline, defined as having less than three spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs) per week, with at least 25% of SBMs associated with one or more of the following conditions: (1) hard to very hard stool consistency; (2) moderate to very severe straining; and/or (3) having a sensation of incomplete evacuation. Use of rescue laxatives was allowed in cases where no bowel movement had occurred in a 3-day period. At baseline, mean oral morphine equivalent daily doses (MEDDs) for the three studies were 99 mg and 130 mg, 237 mg and 265 mg, and 330 mg and 373 mg for placebo- treated and lubiprostone - treated patients, respectively. 1,6,7 Studies one and two have bene published, while study three remains unpublished. The primary endpoint of study one was the \"overall responder\" rat e, defined as 1 SBM improvement over baseline frequency were reported for all treatment weeks for which data were available and 3 SBMs/week were reported for at least 9 of 12 treatment weeks. There was a statistically significant difference in favor of lubiprostone when compared to placebo for overall responder rate (27.1% compared with 18.9%; treatment difference, 8.2%; P=0.030). The primary endpoint of studies two and three was the mean change from baseline in SBM frequency at week eight. For study two, there was a statistically significant difference in changes from baseline in SBM frequency in favor of lubiprostone when compared to placebo (3.3 compared with 2.4; treatment difference, 0.9; P=0.004). However, in the unpublished study three, there was not a statically significant difference in the mean change from baseline in SBM frequency at week eight between lubiprostone and placebo groups (2.7 compared to 2.5; treatment difference -0.2; P=0.76). 1 \u00b7 The efficacy of methylnaltrexone bromide for the treatment of OIC was established in two clinical trials in patients with advanced illness receiving palliative care and one study in patients with chronic non-cancer pain.2,8,9 All studies were double- blind, placebo- controlled studies compared methyln altrexone 0.15 mg/kg and/or 0.3 mg/kg subcutaneously to placebo. The primary endpoint of the first study was the proportion of patients with a rescue- free laxation within four hours after a single dose of study medication or placebo. Methylnaltrexone bromi de-treated patients had a significantly higher rate of laxation within four hours of the double- blind dose (62% for 0.15 mg/kg and 58% for 0.3 mg/kg) than did placebo- treated patients (14%); P<0.0001 for each dose compared with placebo.2,8 The second study evaluated the same primary end- point and found similar results. In this study the proportion of patients who had rescue- free laxation within four hours after receiving the first dose of the study drug was significantly higher in the methylnaltrexone bromide group than the placebo group (48% compared with 15%, respectively; P<0.001). In addition, the proportion of patients who had rescue- free laxation within four hours after receiving two or more of the first four doses was significantly higher in the methylnaltrexone bromide group compared to placebo (52% compared with 8%, P<0.001). 2,9 The safety and efficacy of methylnaltrexone bromide for the treatment of OIC in patients with chronic non- cancer pain was evaluated in an unpublished study with results reported only in the FDA -approved package insert. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with greater than three spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs) per week during the four - week double- blind period. The results from this study showed that 59% of individuals in methylnaltrexone were found to have at least three SBMs per week compared to 38% in the placebo group (P<0.001). 2 \u00b7 The efficacy of naloxegol oxalate for the treatment of OIC in adults receiving opioids for chronic noncancer -relate d pain was evaluated in two phase III trials. Both studies were identically designed multicenter, randomized, double- blind, placebo -controlled, 12 week trials that evaluated naloxegol 12.5 mg and 25 mg compared to placebo. In both of the trials, the primary efficacy outcome was the rate of response over weeks one through 12 (defined as SBMs/week and an increase from baseline of one SBM per week for at least nine of 12 weeks and at least three out of the last four weeks). Results from these two studies revealed that naloxegol 25 mg provided a statistically significant improvement over placebo for the primary outcome (P=0.001 and P=0.02, respectively); however, naloxegol 12.5 mg showed statistical significance only in the first study (P=0.02 and P=0.2, respectively). 3,10 Therapeutic Class Overview : opioid-induced constipation agents Page 3 of 3 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 02/29/ 2016 Key Points within the Medication Class \u00b7 There is limited current clinical guidance that address lubiprostone or the -opioid antagonists' place in therapy for OIC:5,11-14 o Most, existing guidelines were published prior to approval of these agents or are only briefly mentioned.12-14 o Generally well -established bowel regimens are recommended for an initial case of OIC.

Lubiprostone capsules became the first oral agent for the treatment of opioid- induced constipation in April of 2013. In September 2014, naloxegol oxalate became the most recent agent to be approved by the FDA for OIC and is the first oral peripheral -opioid receptor antagonist approved for that indication. 1-3 There is limited c urrent clinical guidance that address lubiprostone or the -opioid antagonists' place in therapy for OIC.5,11-14 Most, existing guidelines were published prior to approval of these a gents or are only briefly mentioned.12-14 Generally well-established bowel regimens are recommended for an initial case of OIC.

The limited guidance that exists regarding the newer agents suggest that they are effective treatment options, but should be reserved for refectory cases of OIC only.5,11-14 There are currently no generic products available.

Clinical Trials The safety and efficacy of agents used for the treatment of opioid- induced constipation have been evaluated in a number of clinical trials.1-3,6- 10 Clinical trials that evaluate these agents for other diagnoses will not be covered in this review. The efficacy of l ubiprostone for the treatment of OIC was in patients receiving opioid therapy for chronic, non - cancer -related pain was assessed in three 12-week, randomized, double- blinded, placebo- controlled studies. In Therapeutic Class Review: opioid-induced constipation agents Page 3 of 15 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 2/29/2016 all three studies, patients had documented opioid- induced constipation at baseline, defined as having less than three spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs) per week, with at least 25% of SBMs associated with one or more of the following conditions: (1) hard to very hard stool consistency; (2) moderate to very severe straining; and/or (3) having a se nsation of incomplete evacuation. Use of rescue laxatives was allowed in cases where no bowel movement had occurred in a 3- day period. At baseline, mean oral morphine equivalent daily doses (MEDDs) for the three studies were 99 mg and 130 mg, 237 mg and 265 mg, and 330 mg and 373 mg for placebo- treated and lubiprostone - treated patients, respectively .1,6,7 Studies one and two have bene published, while study three remains unpublished. The primary endpoint of study one was the \"overall responder\" rate, defined as 1 SBM improvement over baseline frequency were reported for all treatment weeks for which data were available and 3 SBMs/week were reported for at least 9 of 12 treatment weeks. There was a statistically significant difference in favor of lubiprostone when compared to placebo for overall responder rate (27.1% compared with 18.9%; treatment difference, 8.2%; P=0.030). The primary endpoint of studies two and three was the mean change from baseline in SBM frequency at week eight. For study two, there was a statistically significant difference in changes from baseline in SBM frequency in favor of lubiprostone when compared to placebo (3.3 compared with 2.4; treatment difference, 0.9; P=0.004). However, in the unpublished study three, there was not a statically significant difference in the mean change from baseline in SBM frequency at week eight between lubiprostone and placebo groups (2.7 compared to 2.5; treatment difference -0.2; P=0.76). 1 The efficacy of methylnaltrexone bromide for the treatment of OIC was established in two clinical trials in patients with advanced illness receiving palliative care and one study in patients with chronic non- cancer pain. 2,8,9 All studies were double- blind, placebo- controlled studies that compared methylnaltrexone 0.15 mg/kg and/or 0.3 mg/kg subcutaneously to placebo. The primary endpoint of the f irst study was the proportion of patients with a rescue- free laxation within four hours after a single dose of study medication or placebo. Methylnaltrexone bromide- treated patients had a significantly higher rate of laxation within four hours of the double- blind dose (62% for 0.15 mg/kg and 58% for 0.3 mg/kg) than did placebo- treated patients (14%); P<0.0001 for each dose compared with placebo.2,8 The second study evaluated the same primary end- point and found similar results. In this study the proportion of patients who had rescue- free laxation within four hours after receiving the first dose of the study drug was significantly higher in the methylnaltrexone bromide group than the placebo group (48% compared with 15%, respectively; P<0.001). In addition, the proportion of patients who had rescue- free laxation within four hours after receiving two or more of the first four doses was significantly higher in the methylnaltrexone bromide group compared to placebo (52% compared ficacy of methylnaltrexone bromide for the treatment of OIC in patients with chronic non- cancer pain was evaluated in an unpublished study with results reported only in the FDA-approved package insert . The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients wi th greater than three spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs) per week during the four - week double- blind period. The results from this study showed that 59% of individuals in methylnaltrexone were found to have at least three SBMs per week compared to 38% in the placebo group (P<0.001).2 The efficacy of naloxegol oxalate for the treatment of OIC in adults receiving opioids for chronic noncancer -related pain was evaluated in two phase III trials. Both studies were identically designed multicenter, randomized, double - blind, placebo- controlled , 12 week trials that evaluated naloxegol 12.5 mg and 25 mg compared to placebo. In both of the trials, the primary efficacy outcome was the rate of response over weeks one through 12 (defined as SBMs/week and an increase fr om baseline of one SBM per week for at least nine of 12 weeks and at least three out of the last four weeks). Results from these two studies revealed that naloxegol 25 mg provided a statistically significant improvement over placebo for the primary outcome (P=0.001 and P= 0.02, respectively) ; however , naloxegol 12.5 mg showed statistical significance only in the first study (P=0.02 and P=0.2, respectively). 3,10 Therapeutic Class Review: opioid-induced constipation agents Page 4 of 15 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 2/29/2016 Table 4.

Significantly more patients were overall SBM responders throughout the 12- week treatment period in the lubiprostone group than in the placebo group (27.1% [58/214] vs [41/217], respectively; P=0.030). Secondary: The percentage weekly SBM responders was significantly greater in the lubiprostone group compared with the placebo group at weeks one and four (P<0.05) and was numerically greater, but not statistically significant at all other weeks. Mean changes from baseline in SBM frequencies were significantly greater with lubiprostone compared with placebo overall (P=0.001) and at 9 of the 12 treatment weeks (P0.040). Patients treated with lubiprostone had significantly more SBMs within 24 (P=0.008) and 48 (P=0.007) hours after the first dose relative to placebo. Median time to first SBM was significantly shorter with lubiprostone vs placebo (23.5 vs 37.7hours , respectively; P=0.004), with a significantly higher proportion of patients treated with lubiprostone r eporting their first SBM within 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48hours of the first dose (P0.009). Baseline PAC -QOL and EQ -5D scores were comparable for the placebo and lubiprostone treatment groups. There were no significant differences observed over the 12- week treatment period in PAC -QOL and EQ -5D measures between the placebo and lubiprostone treatment groups. Therapeutic Class Review: opioid-induced constipation agents Page 5 of 15 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 2/29/2016 Study and Drug Regimen Study Design and Demographics Sample Size and Study Duration End Points Results Statistically significant improvements, were observed in patients treated with lubiprostone vs placebo in straining, stool consistency, and constipation severity (P=0.004, P<0.001, and P=0.010, respectively). Numerical differences favoring lubiprostone were observed between the treatment groups for abdominal bloating and abdominal discomfort; however, the differences did not reach statistical significance. Cryer et al7 Lubiprostone 24 g BID vs placebo BID A one -time dose reduction to lubiprostone 24 g QD was allowed due to adverse events. Rescue medication could be used if there was no SBM in a three day period. DB, MC, PC, PG, RCT Male and non- pregnant females 18 years of age, stable opioid dose for 30 days, diagnosis of OIC as well as one or more of the following characteristics during each screening week: hard or very hard stools, sensation of incomplete evacuation, or moderate to very severe straining N=418 12 weeks Primary: Change from baseline in the frequency of SBMs at week eight Secondary: Changes from baseline in the frequency of SBMs at week 12 and overall, percentage of patients with the first postdose SBM within 24 and 48 hours of administering study drug, and overall responder rates, patient -assessed overall treatment effectiveness and overall mean change from baseline in constipation -Primary: The change from baseline in SBM frequency was significantly greater with lubiprostone compared with placebo at week eight for patients in the ITT population who did not have a dose reduction by week eight (mean, 3.3 vs 2.4 SBMs/week, P=0.005). Secondary: The overall change from baseline in SBM frequency was also significantly greater with lubiprostone compared with placebo (mean, 2.2 vs 1.6 SBMs/week, P=0.004) ; however, at week 12, the difference numerically favored lubiprostone, but did not reach statistical significance. A significantly greater percentage of patients treated with lubiprostone compared with placebo achieved their first SBM within 24 (P=0.018) and 48 (P=0.050) hours after administration of the first dose of study medication. Although the median time to first SBM in patients treated with lubiprostone was reduced by almost half compared with that of placebo (28.5 vs 46.0 hours, respectively), the difference between treatment groups did not reach statistical significance (P=0.053). Based on patient self -assessments recorded in diary entries, pairwise comparisons showed improvements that significantly favored lubiprostone over placebo for abdominal discomfort (P=0.024), straining (P<0.001), constipation severity (P=0.007), and stool consistency (P<0.001). Patients reported, on average, a change in stool consistency from hard at baseline to approximately normal after lubiprostone treatment. Abdominal bloating and bowel habit regularity were not significantly improved with lubiprostone compared with Therapeutic Class Review: opioid-induced constipation agents Page 6 of 15 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 2/29/2016 Study and Drug Regimen Study Design and Demographics Sample Size and Study Duration End Points Results associated symptoms, bowel habits, and stool consistency placebo; however, th ere was a slightly larger improvement from baseline in the bowel habit regularity score with lubiprostone (0.6) compared with placebo (0.5). Patient ratings of overall treatment effectiveness were significantly better for lubiprostone compared with place bo at all postbaseline time points (P<0.001 to P=0.024) except week three.

After each study dose (dose two through seven), there was a significant difference in the proportion of patients that had rescue- free laxation within four hours which favored the methylnaltrexone group compared to placebo (P<0.005 for each dose). During the double- blind study, 79% of the methylnaltrexone group and 46% of the placebo group had a laxation response within four hours after one or more doses (no P value reported). Rescue- free laxation within 24 hours after each of the seven doses occur red in 55 to 66% of the methylnaltrexone group and in 29 to 39% of the placebo group. There was a significant difference between treatment groups for doses one through four (P<0.05) ; however, there was no statistically significant difference for doses five through seven (no P value reported). The proportion of patients with three or more rescue- free laxations per week was significantly higher in the methylnaltrexone group than in the placebo group (68% compared with 45%, respectively; P=0.009). The time to laxation after the first dose for patients in the methylnaltrexone group was four hours or less, with half responding within 30 minutes. Among all patients, the median time to laxation after the first dose was 6.3 hours in the methylnaltrexone group and more than 48 hours in the placebo group (P<0.001). The shorter time to laxation in the methylnaltrexone group persisted for each of the seven doses (P<0.002 for all comparisons). Patients in the two study groups had similar mean pain scores at baseline and at each evaluation, with minimal changes over time (no P values reported). Scores on the Modified Himmelsbach Withdrawal Scale remained stable throughout the study for both treatment groups (no P value reported).

Secondary: A total of 55% of patients from the sample group were predefined as the laxative inadequate response (LIR) subgroup. The use of daily laxatives was reported by 42% of this subgroup while 31% of this subgroup reported the use of two laxative classes anytime during the 14 days prior to enrollment. A higher percentage of patients in this LIR subgroup responded with naloxegol 12.5 mg compared to placebo (43% vs 29%; P=0.03) and with naloxegol 25 mg compared to placebo (49% v s 29%; P=0.002). There was a shorter time to the first postdose SBM and a higher mean number of days per week with 1 SBM observed with the naloxegol 25 mg group compared to the placebo group (P<0.001). In addition, there was a shorter time to the first postdose SBM and a higher mean number of days per week with 1 SBM observed with the naloxegol 12.5 mg group compared to the placebo group (P<0.001). The median times to first postdose SBM were 6, 20, and 36 hours with naloxegol 25 mg, naloxegol 12.5 mg and placebo, respectively. There was a significant difference in number of days per week with one to three SBMs per day on average over 12 weeks between naloxegol 25 mg and placebo (P<0.001), but not with the naloxegol 12.5 mg group.

Clinical Guidelines Clinical Guideline Recommendations National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN): NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology: palliative care (2013) 12 Constipation \u00b7 If constipation is present: o Assess for cause and severity of constipation o rule out impaction, especially if diarrhea accompanies constipation (overflow around impaction) o Rule out obstruction (physical exam, abdominal x -ray, consider GI consult) o Treat other causes (e.g. , hypercalcemia, hypokalemia, hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, medications o Add and titrate bisacodyl 10 to 15 mg daily to three times a day with a goal of one non-forced bowel movement every one to two days o If impacted \u00a7 Administer glycerine suppository \u00b1 mineral oil retention enema \u00a7 perform manual disimpaction following pre- medication with analgesic \u00b1 anxiolytic \u00b7 If constipation persists: o Reassess for cause and severity of constipation o recheck for impaction or obstruction o consider adding other laxatives, such as bisacodyl (one suppository rectally daily or twice daily), polyethylene glycol (1 capful/8 oz water twice daily); lactulose (30 to 60 mL twice to four times a day), sorbitol, magnesium hydroxide, (0.15 mg/kg subcutaneously every other day, no more than once daily) o Tap water enema until clear o Consider use of a prokinetic agent (e.g. , metoclopramide 10 to 20 mg four times a day) American Gastroenterological Association (AGA): Medical Position Statement on Constipation (2013) 13 \u00b7 After discontinuing medications, when appropriate, that can cause constipation and performing blood and other tests as guided by clinical features, a therapeutic trial (i.e., fiber supplementation and/or osmotic or stimulant laxatives) is recommended. \u00b7 If inadequate response, an anorectal manometry balloon expulsion test can be done. If normal but colonic transit is slow or normal consider laxatives (i.e., PE G, milk of magnesia (MOM), bisacodyl). \u00b7 A newer agent, such as lubiprostone or linaclotide, should be considered when symptoms do not respond to laxatives. \u00b7 Pelvic floor retraining by biofeedback therapy rather than laxatives is recommended for defecatory disorders (improves symptoms in more than 70% of patients). \u00b7 Anorectal tests and colonic transit should be reevaluated when symptoms persist despite an adequate trial of biofeedback therapy. \u00b7 Suppositories or enemas rather than oral laxatives alone should be considered in patients with refractory floor dysfunction (weak recommendation). World Gastroenterology Organization General approach and step -therapy \u00b7 First-line recommendation: o Changes in lifestyle and diet are recommended. Therapeutic Class Review: opioid-induced constipation agents Page 14 of 15 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 2/29/2016 Clinical Guideline Recommendations (WGO): Constipation: a Global Perspective (2010) 14 o If appropriate, stop or reduce constipation -inducing medications. o Addition of fiber supplementation or bulking agents (except in patients with chronic dilation) is recommended. o Gradual increase in fiber and fluid intake is recommended. \u00b7 Second- line recommendation: o Use of osmotic laxatives (with the best evidence for use of PEG, but there is also good evidence for lactulose). o Lubiprostone and linaclotide act by stimulating ileal secretion and thus increasing fecal water. \u00b7 Third -line recom mendation: o Use of stimulant laxatives (such as bisacodyl, sodium picosulfate or senna for occasional use), enemas, or prokinetic agents (can be used daily). Conclusions There are currently three agents approved by the FDA for the treatment OIC, lubiprostone (Amitiza\u00ae), methylnaltrexone bromide (Relistor\u00ae), and naloxegol oxalate (Movantik\u00ae). Each has been approved for the treatment of OIC in adults with chronic non- cancer pain. Additionally, methylnaltrexone bromide is also FDA -approved for use in adults with OIC who have advanced illness and are receiving palliative care.1-3 Lubiprostone is also indicated for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation, and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation. Agents used for the treatment of OIC work via one of two mechanisms. Lubiprostone is a locally acting chloride channel activator that increases intestinal fluid secretion, which increases motility of the intestine, thereby increasing the passage of stool and alleviating symptoms of constipation. 1 Methylnaltrexone bromide and naloxegol oxalate are selective -opioid antagonists that prevent the peripheral activation of -opioid receptors in certain tissues, such as the gastrointestinal tract, thus reducing the constipation side- effect. At therapeutic doses, neither agent interferes with the analgesic activity of opioids, which is caused by activation of -opioid receptors within the central nervous system (CNS).2-3 Methylnaltrexone bromide is a quaternary amine, which increases its polarity, and helps prevents its penetration into the CNS.2 Naloxegol oxalate is a PEGylated derivative of naloxone, and is a substrate for the P -glycoprotein transporter (P -gp). The presence of a polyethylene glycol (PEG) moiety reduces its passive permeability into the CNS while being a substrate for P -gp increases efflux of naloxegol across the blood- brain barrer.3 Lubiprostone capsules and naloxegol oxylate tablets are oral agents taken every day scheduled. Lubiprostone is administered twice daily; while naloxegol is administered once daily. Methylnaltrexone bromide is a subcutaneous injection administered every other day as needed. The safety and efficacy of agents used to treat OIC have been established in a number of clinical trials. 1-3,6-10 There is limited current clinical guidance that address lubiprostone or the -opioid antagonists' place in therapy for OIC.5,11-14 Most, existing guidelines were published prior to approval of these agents or are only briefly mentioned.12- 14 Generally wel l-established bowel regimens are recommended for an initial case of OIC. All laxatives are potential options and there is no data to suggest that any one approach is superior to any other. The limited guidance that exists regarding the newer agents suggest that they are effective treatment options, but should be reserved for refectory cases of OIC only.5,11-14 Naloxegol oxylate is associated with several severe drug- interactions, which may limit its use.3 There are currently no generic products approved for the treatment of OIC.

Page 1 of 10 Copyright 2015 Review Completed on 05/04/2015 Therapeutic Class Overview Long- acting Opioids Therapeutic Class \u00b7 Overview/Summary: As a class, opioid analgesics encompass a group of naturally occurring, semisynthetic, and synthetic drugs that stimulate opiate receptors and effectively relieve pain without producing loss of consciousness. The l ong-acting opioids and their Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved indications are outlined in Table 2.1-18 Previously, they were prescribed for the management of moderate to severe chronic pain; however, starting in March 2014, the FDA's required label changes were made for most of the agents, updating their indication.19 Currently, long- acting opioids are indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around- the- clock, long- term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. This change was made for all long- acting opioids in an effort to help prescribers and patients make better decisions about who benefits from opioids and also to help prevent problems associated with their use.19 In addition to indication changes, the long- acting opioid label must include statements that the long-acting opioid is not for \"as needed\" use, that it has an innate risk of addiction, abuse and misuse even at recommended doses, and finally it must include an update to the black box warning for increased risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS).19 Long- acting opioids are available in a variety of different dosage forms, and currently several agents are available generically. Pain is one of the most common and debilitating patient complaints, with persistent pain having the potentially to lead to functional impairment and disability, psychological distress, and sleep deprivation. Two broad categories of pain include adaptive and maladaptive. Adaptive pain contributes to survival by protecting individuals from injury and/or promoting healing when injury has occurred. Maladaptive, or chronic pain, is pain as a disease and represents pathologic functioning of the nervous system. Various definitions of chronic pain currently exist and may be based on a speci fied duration of pain; however, in general, the condition can be defined as pain which lasts beyond the ordinary duration of time that an insult or injury to the body needs to heal. Pain can also be categorized as being either nociceptive or neuropathic, and treatments for each are specific. Nociceptive pain is caused by damage to tissue and can further be divided into somatic (pain arising from injury to body tissues) and visceral pain (pain arising from the internal organs). Visceral pain is often described as poorly localized, deep, dull, and cramping. In contrast, neuropathic pain arises from abnormal neural activity secondary to disease, injury, or dysfunction of the nervous system. 20 Several mechanisms are thought to be involved in the promotion and/or facilitation of chronic pain, and include peripheral and central sensitization, ectopic excitability, structural reorganization/phenotypic switch of neurons, primary sensory degeneration, and disinhibition. Patients not responding to traditional pain treatments may require individualized and supplemental conventional treatment approaches that target different mechanisms. 20 Several pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic options are currently available for the management of chronic pain. Available treatment options make up six major categories: pharmacologic, physical medicine, behavioral medicine, neuromodulation, interventional, and surgical approaches. As stated previously, some patients may require multiple treatment approaches in order to achieve adequate control of their chronic pain. Pharmacologic therapy should not be the sole focus of pain treatment; however, it is the most widely utilized option to manage chronic pain. Major pharmacologic categories used in the management of pain and topical analgesics. Combining pharmacologic therapies may result in improved analgesia, and because lower doses of each agent can be used, patients may experience fewer treatment -emergent adverse events. Response to pharmacologic therapies will vary between individual patients, and currently no one approach has been demonstrated to be appropriate for all patients. Treatment decisions are largely based on the type of pain (e.g., neuropathic, nociceptive), comorbidities, concurrent medications, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties of the agent, and anticipated adverse events. 21 Therapeutic Class Overview : opioids (long- acting) Page 2 of 10 Copyright 2015 Review Completed on 05/04/2015 For the treatment of neuropathic pain, generally accepted first line therapies include calcium channel should be utilized second line, and opioids should be considered as a second or third line option for most patients. Ideally, nociceptive pain is primarily managed with the use of non- opioid analgesics, with acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs utilized first line in the management of mild to moderate pain. Opioids are associated with a risk of abuse and overdose, and the evidence for the effectiveness of long term opioid therapy in providing pain relief and improving functional outcomes is limited. Use of opioids in the management of chronic noncancer pain remains controversial, and consideration for their use in this clinical setting should be weighed carefully. Opioids should be reserved for the treatment of pain of any severity not adequately controlled with non- opioid analgesics or antidepressants, more severe forms of acute pain, and cancer pain. If being considered for the treatment of chronic noncancer pain, opioids should be further reserved for patients with moderate to severe chronic pain that is adversely affecting patient function and/or quality of life. 21 The long- acting opioid agents primarily produce intense analgesia via their agonist actions at mu receptors, which are found in large numbers within the central nervous system. The binding of these agents to mu receptors produces a variety of other effects including bradycardia, sedation, euphoria, physical dependence, and respiratory depression. Key safety concerns associated with the opioid analgesics include respiratory depression, and to a lesser degree, circulatory depression. 21,22 All of the long- acting opioids are classified as Schedule II controlled substances by the FDA, with the exception of buprenorphine transdermal systems which are a Schedule III controlled substance. Buprenorphine is a partial opiate agonist, and the transdermal system is the first and only seven day transdermal opioid approved by the FDA. 1 On July 9, 2012, the FDA approved a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for all long- acting opioids. The program requires companies who manufacture long- acting opioids to make training regarding proper prescribing practices available for health care professionals who prescribe these agents, as well as distribute educational materials to both prescribers and patients on the safe use of these agents. The new REMS program is part of the national prescription drug abuse plan announced by the Obama Administration in 2011 to combat prescription drug misuse and abuse. 23 On March 11, 2014, the FDA approved a new combination product Xart emis XR \u00ae (oxycodone/acetaminophen) a bilayer formulation which has an immediate- and extended- release portion allowing for rapid analgesia with prolonged effects. This product, although new, is not formulated as an abuse- deterrent product. It has the unique indication of management of acute, severe pain, which is not shared with any of the other long-acting opioids. Due to the acetaminophen component use of this medication is limited, as a maximum of 4,000 mg/day is recommended by the manufacturer.18 According to the FDA abuse and misuse of prescription opioid products has created a serious and growing public health problem. The FDA considers the development of abuse- deterrent products a priority. As outlined in their guidance for evaluation and labeling, \"abuse- deterrent properties\" are defined as those properties shown to meaningfully deter abuse, even if they do not fully prevent abuse. The FDA elected to use the term \"abuse- deterrent\" rather than \"tamper- resistant\" because the latter term refers to, or is used in connection with, packaging requirements applicable to certain classes of drugs, devices, and cosmetics. Abuse- deterrent technologies should target known or expected routes of abuse relevant to t he proposed product. The FDA has provided several categories for abuse- deterrent formulations. Categories include physical/chemical barriers, agonist/antagonist combinations, aversion (adding a product that has an unpleasant effect if manipulated or is used at a higher than recommended dose), delivery systems, new molecular entities/prodrugs, a combination of these methods, or a novel approach (encompasses approaches or technologies not currently captured in previous categories) . 24 Hysingla ER \u00ae (hydrocodone ER) tablets are resistant to crushing, breaking and dissolution using different solvents, and the tablets still retain some extended- release properties after tampering. Attempts to Therapeutic Class Overview : opioids (long- acting) Page 3 of 10 Copyright 2015 Review Completed on 05/04/2015 dissolve the tablets result in the formation of a viscous gel, which may cause difficulty passing through a hypodermic needle.1 In addition, the tablets appear to be associated with less \"drug liking\" based upon results reported from two unpublished clinical abuse potential studies conducted in a small number of non-dependent recreational opioid users.25 The abuse deterrent properties of Hysingla ER\u00ae (hydrocodone extended- release) is a potential strength of the formulation, as well as once daily dosing and demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of chronic pain. Potential weaknesses of Hysingla ER\u00ae (hydrocodone extended- release) include the high cost relative to generic long- acting opioid formulations, the high degree of subjects' willingness to take milled Hysingla ER\u00ae (hydrocodone extended- release) tablets again via oral ingestion in a clinical abuse potential study and the drug interaction that exists between Hysingla ER \u00ae (hydrocodone extended- release) and \"strong laxatives\" which many patients on chronic opioid treatment require. The current formulation of OxyContin\u00ae (oxyco done ER) utilizes the RESISTEC\u00ae technology that employs a combination of polymer and processing that gives tablet hardness, imparts viscosity when dissolved in aqueous solutions and resists increased drug release rate when mixed with alcoholic beverages. 10 Results from trials support that, the reformulated oxycodone ER is able to resist crushing, breaking, extraction and dissolution in small volumes using a variety of tools and solvents. 26-28 When subjected to small volumes of an aqueous environment, oxycodone ER gradually forms a viscous hydrogel (i.e., a gelatinous mass) that resists passage through a needle. 26 In addition, a crushed formulation of oxycodone ER was rated lower than the crushed formulation of the original OxyContin\u00ae (oxycodone ER) and oxycodone powder when administered intranasally. There were also more reports of intranasal irritation with the reformulated oxycodone ER.27,28 Originally approved by the FDA in 2009, Embeda\u00ae (morphine sulfate/naltrexone hydrochloride) was voluntarily recalled from the market in March 2011 due to stability issues with the manufacturing process. 29 Subsequently, in November 2013, the FDA approved a manufacturing supplement for the product after the stability concerns were addressed through the manufacturing process. The abuse deterrent formulation of Embeda \u00ae (morphine sulfate/naltrexone hydrochloride) was granted FDA approval in October 2014, making it the third extended- release opioid analgesic to obtain this designation and the first among the morphine extended- release products.30 Embeda\u00ae (morphine sulfate/naltrexone hydrochloride) capsules contain pellets consisting of morphine sulfate with a sequestered core of naltrexone hydrochloride at a ratio of 100:4. 3 If morphine sulfate/ naltrexone hydrochloride is crushed, chewed, or dissolved up to 100% of the sequestered naltrexone is released, reversing the effects of morphine, potentially precipitating withdrawal in opioid tolerant individuals, and increasing the risk of overdose and death. 30 Table 1.

Evidence- based M edicine \u00b7 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of hydrocodone ER tablets (Hysingla ER\u00ae) was evaluated in an unpublished randomized double- blind, placebo controlled, multi- center, 12- week clinical trial in both opioid -experienced and opioid- na\u00efve patients with moderate to severe chronic low back pain. Patients received either hydrocodone ER 20 to 120 mg tablets or matching placebo in a 1:1 ratio. There was a statistically significant difference in the weekly average pain scores at week 12 between the hydrocodone ER and placebo groups with a least square mean (standard deviation [SD]) difference of -0.53 (0.180) to -0.178; P=0.0016) . There were also significant improvements in proportion of responders, and Patient's Global Impression of Change scores. 4,31 \u00b7 The effectiveness of fentanyl in relieving pain appears to be similar to that of morphine sulfate sustained- release for the treatment of cancer and noncancer pain, and chronic lower back pain. Compared to morphine sulfate sustained- release, fentany l transdermal systems appear to be associated with less constipation.32-34 \u00b7 A trial comparing hydrocodone ER capsules to placebo in patients with moderate to severe chronic low back pain demonstrated hydrocodone ER had a lower mean change from baseline in pain intensity scores compared to placebo at 12 weeks (P=0.008). In addition, there was a significantly higher amount of treatment responders in the hydrocodone ER group compared to the placebo group (P<0.001) at t he end of treatment, and subject global assessment of medication scores increased from baseline significantly in the hydrocodone ER group compared to placebo ( P<0.0001).35 \u00b7 In one trial, hydromorphone ER demonstrated greater efficacy in the treatment of lower back pain with regard to reducing pain intensity (P<0.001) and pain scores (P<0.01) compared to placebo.36 In a noninferiority analysis of a hydromorphone ER compared to oxycodone ER, two agents provided similar pain relief in the management of osteoart hritic pain.37 \u00b7 Methadone has demonstrated a greater efficacy over placebo for the treatment of nonmalignant neuropathic pain and similar efficacy compared to slow -release morphine sulfate for the treatment of cancer pain.38,39 \u00b7 A trial comparing different long- acting formulations of morphine sulfate for the treatment of osteoarthritis pain demonstrated that both Avinza\u00ae (morphine sulfate ER) and MS Contin\u00ae (morphine sulfate ER) significantly reduced pain from baseline (P0.05 for both). Both treatments also reduced overall arthritis pain intensity, and achieved comparable improvements in physical functioning and stiffness. Each treatment significantly improved certain sleep parameters compared to placebo.39 In a crossover trial, morphine sulfate (MS Contin\u00ae) was compared to fentanyl transdermal systems, and more patients preferred fentanyl transdermal systems (P<0.001), and reported on average, lower pain intensity scores than morphine sulfate phase (P<0.001).41 \u00b7 Clinical trial data evaluating the combination long acting opioid agent morphine/naltrexone is limited. As mentioned previously, this product was recalled by the manufacturer due to not meeting a pre- specified stability requirement during routine testing in March 2011.29 \u00b7 Morphine/naltrexone has demonstrated significantly better pain control compared to placebo in patients with osteoarthritis pain.42 Therapeutic Class Overview : opioids (long- acting) Page 7 of 10 Copyright 2015 Review Completed on 05/04/2015 \u00b7 Oxycodone ER has demonstrated significantly greater efficacy compared to placebo for the treatment of neuropathic pain and chronic refractory neck pain.43-45 For the treatment of cancer pain, no significant differences were observed between oxycodone ER and morphine sulfate ER in reducing pain intensity. The average number of rescue doses used within a 24 hour period was significantly less with morphine sulfate ER (P=0.01), and the incidence of nausea and sedation were similar between treatments.46 \u00b7 Oxymorphone ER has produced similar mean daily pain intensity scores compared to both morphine sulfate and oxycodone ER for the treatment of chronic cancer pain. 47,48 The average scheduled daily dose of study drug and average total daily dose decreased after patients crossed over to oxymorphone ER from morphine sulfate or oxycodone ER. No significant changes were observed in visual analog pain scores, quality of life domains, or quality of sleep in any of the treatment groups. 47 In another trial, oxymorphone ER demonstrated greater efficacy for the relief of osteoarthritis pain compared to placebo.49 \u00b7 In a 12- week active comparator and placebo- controlled trial, significant pain relief was achieved with tapentadol ER compared to placebo (least squares mean difference, - 0.7; 95% CI, -1.04 to -0.33) at week 12. The average pain intensity rating at endpoint with oxycodone ER was reduced significantly compared to placebo for the overall maintenance period (least squares mean difference vs placebo , - 0.3), but was not significantly lower at week 12 ( least squares mean, -0.3; P values not reported).50 In a, placebo- controlled and active comparator trial in adults with moderate to severe low back pain , improvements in average pain intensity scores occurred with t apentadol ER and oxycodone ER relative to placebo (P<0.001).51 Schwartz et al evaluated tapentadol ER among adults with painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy. The least squares mean change in average pain intensity at week 12 was 1.4 in the placebo group, indicating a worsening in pain intensity, and 0.0 in the tapentadol ER group, indicating no change in pain intensity, (least squares mean difference, -1.3; 95% CI, -1.70 to - 0.92; P<0.001).52 \u00b7 The combination product o xycodone/acetaminophen's efficacy was established in a clinical trial evaluating its effectiveness at treating pain over the 48 hours after surgery. Singla et al concluded that pain, evaluated by the summed pain intensity difference (SPID) score, was significantly higher in the oxycodone/acetaminophen group (P<0.001) through that time period. Mean total pain relief values for oxycodone/APAP XR and placebo from 0 to 48 hours were 91.3 and 70.9, respectively, resulting in a treatment difference of 20.5 (95% C I, 11.0 to 30.0; P<0.001). The median time to perceptible pain relief for oxycodone/APAP XR was 33.56 minutes vs 43.63 minutes for placebo (P=0.002). The median times to confirmed pain relief and meaningful pain relief for the oxycodone/APAP XR group were 47.95 minutes and 92.25 minutes; however, neither of these metrics could be determined for the placebo group ( P<0.001). The percentage of patients reporting at least a 30% reduction in PI after 2 hours was 63.1% for oxycodone/APAP XR versus 27.2% for place bo (P<0.0001). 53 \u00b7 Methadone is the only long -acting narcotic that is Food and Drug Administration -approved for the management of opioid addiction; however, in one study slow -release morphine sulfate demonstrated noninferiority to methadone in terms of completion rate for the treatment of opioid addiction (51 vs 49%).54 Key Points within the Medication Class \u00b7 According to C urrent Clinical G uidelines: o The current clinical guidelines regarding the use of opioids recognize their established efficacy in the treatment of moderate to severe pain. None of the available agents are distinguished from the others in the class, and recommendations for treatment are made for the class as a whole. o Patients with pain should be started on acetaminophen or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). If sufficient pain relief is not achieved, patients should be escalated to a \"weak opioid\" and then to a \"strong opioid\", such 55,56 o Opioid selection, initial dosing, and titration should be individualized according to the patient's health status, previous exposure to opioids, attainment of therapeutic goals, and predicted or observed harms. There is insufficient evidence to recommend s hort-acting vs long-acting opioids, or as needed vs around- the-clock dosing of opioids. 56 Therapeutic Class Overview : opioids (long- acting) Page 8 of 10 Copyright 2015 Review Completed on 05/04/2015 o Patients with chronic persistent pain controlled by stable doses of short -acting opioids should be provided with round- the-clock ER or long- acting formulation opioids with provision of a 'rescue dose' to manage break -through or transient exacerbations of pain.55 o Opioids with rapid onset and short duration are preferred as rescue doses. The repeated need for rescue doses per day may indicate the necessity to adjust the baseline treatment.55,56 o In a patient who has not been exposed to opioids in the past, morphine is generally considered the standard starting drug of choice.55 o Pure agonists (such as codeine, fentanyl, oxycodone, and oxymorphone) are the most commonly used medications in the management of cancer pain. Opioid agonists with a short half-life are preferred and Meperidine, mixed agonist are not recommended for cancer patients. Meperidine is contraindicated for chronic pain especially in patients with impaired renal function or dehydration.55 o In patients who require relatively high doses of chronic opioid therapy, clinicians should evaluate for unique opioid- related adverse events, changes in health status, and adherence to the chronic opioid therapy treatment plan on an ongoing basis, and consider more frequent follow -up visits. 55,56 \u00b7 Other Key Facts: o There are currently four abuse deterrent formulations of extended- release, long acting opioids approved by the FDA. These include o xycodone ER (OxyContin\u00ae), morphine sulfate/naltrexone Hysingla ER\u00ae). o All long- acting opioids are pregnancy category C, with the exception of oxycodone. o Only fentanyl transdermal system is approved in children (age 2 to 17 years ). o Tapentadol is contraindicated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors ; although, caution should be used when used in combination with any long- acting opioid. o Only oxymorphone is contraindicated in severe hepatic disease. o Methadone and buprenorphine have been implicated in QT prolongation and serious arrhythmias, use caution in patients at increased risk of QT prolongation. o Besides the two transdermal agents, almost all long- acting opioids are dosed twice daily. Buprenorphine patches are applied once every seven days, while fentanyl transdermal systems are applied every 72 hours.1,2 Exalgo\u00ae and Hysingla ER (morphine) capsules and Embeda\u00ae (morphine/naltrexone) capsules can to be administered once or twice daily.12,17 MS Contin\u00ae (morphine) tablets or all methadone formulations are dosed twice or three times daily.6-10,13 The remaining long- acting agents are dosed twice only long- acting opioid s with a maximum daily dose . Avinza\u00ae (morphine) has a max dose of 1,600 mg/day due to the capsules being formulated with fumaric acid, which at that dose has not been shown to be safe and effective and may cause renal toxicity 11. Xartemis XR (oxycodone/acetaminophen) is limited to four tablets per day, and/or if taking other acetaminophen products, a maximum of 4,000 mg/day.18 o Buprenorphine patch and fentanyl transdermal systems are intended for transdermal use only and should be applied to intact, nonirritated, nonirradiated skin on a flat surface. The application site should be hairless, or nearly hairless, and if required hair should be clipped not shaven. Fentanyl may be applied to the chest, back, flank or upper arm while buprenorphine should be applied to the right or left outer arm, upper chest, upper back or side of chest. 1,2 o Most solid, long-acting opioid formulations ( e.g., tablets, capsules) should be swallowed whole and should not be broken, chewed, cut, crushed, or dissolved before swallowing.1-18 The only exceptions are the morphine- containing capsules (Avinza\u00ae, Kadian\u00ae, and Embeda\u00ae); all can be opened and the pellets sprinkled on applesauce and then swallowed whole.11,12 ,17 Kadian\u00ae pellets can also be placed in 10 mL of water and used through a 16 Therapeutic Class Overview : opioids (long- acting) Page 9 of 10 Copyright 2015 Review Completed on 05/04/2015 French gastrostomy tube.12 Neither Avinza\u00ae, Kadian\u00ae, nor Embeda\u00ae pellets may be used thorough a nasogastric tube.11,12,17 It is recommended to only swallow one at a time.3,14-16 o Differences in pharmacokinetics result in differences in how often the dose of an opioid may be titrated upward. Each long- acting opioid has a certain time period before which a dose titration can occur. The amount of time required before dose titration can occur can range from one to seven days. The specific times required for titration are listed in Table 10.1-18 When switching between agents, an appropriate dose conversion table must be used. When discontinuing any long- acting opioid without starting another, always use a slow taper to prevent severe withdrawal symptoms. References 1. Butrans\u00ae [package insert]. Stamford insert].

Page 1 of 106 Copyright 2015 Review Completed on 05/04 /2015 Therapeutic Class Review Long-a cting Opioids Overview/Summary As a class, opioid analgesics encompass a group of naturally occurring, semisynthetic, and synthetic drugs that stimulate opiate receptors and effectively relieve pain without producing loss of consciousness. The long- acting opioids and their Food and Drug Administration ( FDA)-approved indications are outlined in Table 2.1-18 Previously , they were prescribed for the management of moderate to severe chronic pain; however, starting in March 2014, the FDA 's required label changes were made for most of the agents, updating their indication.19 Currently, long- acting opioids are indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around- the-clock, long- term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. This change was made for all long- acting opioids in an effort to help prescribers and patients make better decisions about who benefits from opioids and also to help prevent problems associated with their use. 19 In addition to indication changes, the long- acting opioid label must include statements that the long- acting opioid is not for \"as needed\" use, that it has an innate risk of addiction, abuse and misuse even at recommended doses, and finally it must include an update to the black box warning for increased risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS).19 Long- acting opioids are available in a variety of different dosage forms . Several agents are currently available as a generic product . Pain is one of the most common and debilitating patient complaints, with persistent pain having the potentially to lead to functional impairment and disability, psychological distress, and sleep deprivation. Two broad categories of pain include adaptive and maladaptive. Adaptive pain contributes to survival by protecting individuals from injury and/or promoting healing when injury has occurred. Maladaptive, or chronic pain, is pain as a disease and represents pathologic functioning of the nervous system. Various definition s of chronic pain currently exist and may be based on a specified duration of pain; however, in general, the condition can be defined as pain which lasts beyond the ordinary duration of time that an insult or injury to the body needs to heal. Pain can also be categorized as being either nociceptive or neuropathic, and treatments for each are specific. Nociceptive pain is caused by damage to tissue and can further be divided into somatic (pain arising from injury to body tissues) and visceral pain (pain aris ing from the internal organs). Visceral pain is often described as poorly localized, deep, dull, and cramping. In contrast, neuropathic pain arises from abnormal neural activity secondary to disease, injury, or dysfunction of the nervous system. 20 Severa l mechanisms are thought to be involved in the promotion and/or facilitation of chronic pain, and include peripheral and central sensitization, ectopic excitability, structural reorganization/phenotypic switch of neurons, primary sensory degeneration, and disinhibition. Patients not responding to traditional pain treatments may require individualized and supplemental conventional treatment approaches that target different mechanisms. 20 Several pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic options are currently availab le for the management of chronic pain. Available treatment options make up six major categories: pharmacologic, physical medicine, behavioral medicine, neuromodulation, interventional, and surgical approaches. As stated previously, some patients may require multiple treatment approaches in order to achieve adequate control of their chronic pain. Pharmacologic therapy should not be the sole focus of pain treatment; however, it is the most widely utilized option to manage chronic pain. Major pharmacologic categories used in the management of pain and topical analgesics. Combining pharmacologic therapies may result in improved analgesia, and because lower doses of each agent can be used, patients may experience fewer treatment -emergent adverse events. Response to pharmacologic therapies will vary between individual patients, and currently no one approach has been demonstrated to be appropriate for all patients. Treatment decisions are largely based on the type of pain (e.g., neuropathic, nociceptive), comorbidities, concurrent medications, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties of the agent, and anticipated adverse events. 21 Therapeutic Class Review: opioids (long-acting) Page 2 of 106 Copyright 2015 Review Completed on 05/04/2015 For the treatment of neuropathic pain, generally accepted first line therapies include calcium channel 2- detla should be utilized second line, and opioids should be considered as a second or third line option for most patients. Ideally, nociceptive pain is primarily managed with the use of non-opioid analgesics, with acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs utilized first line in the management of mild to moderate pain. Opioids are associated with a risk of abuse and overdose, and the evidence for the effectiveness of long term opioid therapy in providing pain relief and improving functional outcomes is limited. Use of opioids in the management of chronic noncancer pain remains controversial, and consideration for their use in this clinical setting should be weighed carefully. Opioids should be reserved for the treatment of pain of any severity not adequately controlled with non- opioid analgesics or antidepressants, more severe forms of acute pain, and cancer pain. If being considered for the treatment of chronic noncancer pain, opioids should be further reserved for patients with moderate to severe chronic pain that is adversely affecting patient function and/or quality of life. 21 The long- acting opioid agents primarily produce intense analgesia via their agonist actions at mu receptors, which are found in large numbers w ithin the central nervous system. The binding of these agents to mu receptors produces a variety of other effects including bradycardia, sedation, euphoria, physical dependence, and respiratory depression. Key safety concerns associated with the opioid analgesics include respiratory depression, and to a lesser degree, circulatory depression. 21,22 All of the long- acting opioids are classified as Schedule II controlled substances by the FDA, with the exception of buprenorphine transdermal systems which are a Schedule III controlled substance. Buprenorphine is a partial opiate agonist, and the transdermal system is the first and only seven day transdermal opioid approved by the FDA. 1 On July 9, 2012, the FDA approved a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for all long -acting opioids. The program requires companies who manufacture long-acting opioids to make training regarding proper prescribing practices available for health care professionals who prescribe these agents, as well as distribute educati onal materials to both prescribers and patients on the safe use of these agents. The new REMS program is part of the national prescription drug abuse plan announced by the Obama Administration in 2011 to combat prescription drug misuse and abuse. 23 On March 11, 2014, the FDA approved a new combination product oxycodone/acetaminophen ( Xartemis XR \u00ae). It has a bilayer formulation which has an immediate- and extended- release portion allowing for rapid analgesia with prolonged effects. This product has the unique indication of management of acute, severe pain, which is not shared with any of the other long- acting opioids. Due to the acetaminophen component use of this medication is limited, as a maximum of 4,000 mg/day is recommended by the manufacturer. 18 According to the FDA abuse and misuse of prescription opioid products has created a serious and growing public health problem. The FDA considers the development of abuse- deterrent products a priority. As outlined in their guidance for evaluation and labeling, \"abuse- deterrent properties\" are defined as those properties shown to meaningfully deter abuse, even if they do not fully prevent abuse. The FDA elected to use the term \"abuse- deterrent\" rather than \"tamper -resistant\" because the latter term refers to, or is used in connection with, packaging requirements applicable to certain classes of drugs, devices, and cosmetics. Abuse- deterrent technologies should target known or expected routes of abuse relevant to the proposed product. The FDA has provided several categories for abuse- deterrent formulations. Categories include physical/chemical barriers, agonist/antagonist combinations, aversion (adding a product that has an unpleasant effect if manipulated or is used at a higher than recommended dose), delivery systems, new molecular entities/prodrugs, a combination of these methods, or a novel approach (encompasses approaches or technologies not currently captured in previous categories) . 24 Hysingla ER\u00ae (hydrocodone ER) tablets are resistant to crushing, breaking and dissolution using different solvents, and the tablets still retain some extended- release properties after tampering. Attempts to dissolve the tablets result in the formation of a viscous gel, which may cause difficulty passing through a hypodermic needle. 1 In addition, the tablets appear to be associated with less \"drug liking\" based upon results reported from two unpublished clinical abuse potential studies conducted in a small number of Therapeutic Class Review: opioids (long-acting) Page 3 of 106 Copyright 2015 Review Completed on 05/04/2015 non-dependent recreational opioid users.25 The abuse deterrent properties of Hysingla ER\u00ae (hydrocodone extended- release) is a potential strength of the formulation, as well as once daily dosing and demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of chronic pain. Potential weaknesses of Hysingla ER\u00ae (hydrocodone extended- release) include the high cost relative to generic long- acting opioid formulations, the high degree of subjects' willingness to take milled Hysingla ER\u00ae (hydrocodone extended- release) tablets again via oral ingestion in a clinical abuse potential study and the drug interaction that exists between Hysingla ER\u00ae (hydrocodone extended- release) and \"strong laxatives\" which many patients on chronic opioid treatment require. The current formulation of OxyConti n\u00ae (oxycodone ER) utilizes the RESISTEC\u00ae technology that employs a combination of polymer and processing that gives tablet hardness, imparts viscosity when dissolved in aqueous solutions and resists increased drug release rate when mixed with alcoholic bev erages.10 Results from trials support that, the reformulated oxycodone ER is able to resist crushing, breaking, extraction and dissolution in small volumes using a variety of tools and solvents. 26-28 When subjected to small volumes of an aqueous environment, oxycodone ER gradually forms a viscous hydrogel (i.e., a gelatinous mass) that resists passage through a needle.26 In addition, a crushed formulation of oxycodone ER was rated lower than the crushed formulation of the original OxyContin\u00ae (oxycodone ER) and oxycodone powder when administered intranasally. There were also more reports of intranasal irritation with the reformulated oxycodone ER.27,28 Originally approved by the FDA in 2009, Embeda \u00ae (morphine sulfate/naltrexone hydrochloride) was voluntaril y recalled from the market in March 2011 due to stability issues with the manufacturing process.29 Subsequently, in November 2013, the FDA approved a manufacturing supplement for the product after the stability concerns were addressed through the manufacturing process. The abuse deterrent formulation of Embeda \u00ae (morphine sulfate/naltrexone hydrochloride) was granted FDA approval in October 2014, making it the third extended- release opioid analgesic to obtain this designation and the first among the morphine extended- release products.30 Embeda\u00ae (morphine sulfate/naltrexone hydrochloride) capsules contain pellets consisting of morphine sulfate with a sequestered core of naltrexone hydrochloride at a ratio of 100:4. 3 If morphine sulfate/ naltrexone hydrochloride is crushed, chewed, or dissolved up to 100% of the sequestered naltrexone is released, reversing the effects of morphine, potentially precipitating withdrawal in opioid tolerant individuals, and increasing the risk of overdose and death. 30 Medications Table 1.

In general, opioids are used for the treatment of noncancer and cancer pain; however, data establishing their effectiveness in the treatment of neuropathic pain is avai lable. Clinical trials demonstrating the effectiveness and safety of the long -acting opioids are outlined in Table 4. Head- to- head trials of long- acting opioids do exist and for the most part the effectiveness of the individual agents, in terms of pain relief, appears to be similar. Small differences between the agents exist in adverse event profiles and associated improvements in quality of life or sleep domains. 33-78 Therapeutic Class Review: opioids (long-acting) Page 6 of 106 Copyright 2015 Review Completed on 05/04/2015 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of hydrocodone ER tablets (Hysingla ER\u00ae) was evaluated in an unpublished randomized double- blind, placebo controlled, multi- center, 12- week clinical trial in both opioid- experienced and opioid- na\u00efve patients with moderate to severe chronic low back pain. Five hundred eighty -eight patients who were not responsive to their prior analgesic therapy were randomized into the study after up to 45 days of an open- label conversion and dose- titration period. Patients received either hydrocodone ER tablets or matching placebo in a 1:1 ratio. Those patients randomized to placebo were given a blinded taper of hydrocodone ER tablets according to a prespecified tapering schedule, three days on each step- down dose (reduced by 25 to 50% from the previous dose). Patients were allowed to use rescue medication (immediate- release oxycodone 5 mg) up to six doses ( six tablets) per day depending on their randomized hydrocodone ER dose. There was a statistically significant difference in the weekly average pain scores at week 12 between the hydrocodone ER and placebo groups with a least square mean (standard deviation [SD]) difference of -0.53 (0.180) (95% P=0.0016) . Treatment with hydrocodone ER tablets resulted in a higher pro portion of responders which was defined as patients with at least a 30% and 50% improv ement (P=0.0033 and P=0.0225 for 30% and 50% respectively). Additionally, there was significant improvements in Patient's Global Impression of Change (PGIC ) scores as com pared with placebo ( P=0.0036). There was , however , no significant improvement in Medical Outcome Study Sleep Scale - Revised (MOS Sleep -R).4,33 A second study ( open- label and extension) confirmed the safety and effectiveness of hydrocodone ER tablets found with the previous clinical trial over a long -term therapy (at least one year).34 FDA approval of buprenorphine transdermal system was based on four unpublished, 12- week double- blind clinical trials in opioid -na\u00efve and opioid- experienced patients with moderate to severe chronic low back pain or osteoarthritis using pain scores as the primary efficacy variable. The description of these trials has been obtained from the prescribing information and the manufacturer product dossier. Two of these four trials demonstrated efficacy in patients with chronic low back pain. In one trial (N=1,160), treatment with buprenorphine transdermal system resulted in significant treatment differences in the average pain score over the last 24 hours at week 12 in favor of transdermal buprenorphine 20 g/hr and oxycodone immediate- release compared to buprenorphine 5 g/hr (P<0.001 for both). In the second trial (N=1,024), treatment with either 10 or 20 g/hr of buprenorphine transdermal system resulted in a treatment difference in favor of buprenorphine (95% confidence interval [CI], -1.02 to -0.14; P=0.01) compared to placebo. Two other trials failed to show efficacy for buprenorphine transdermal system in patients with low back pain and osteoarthritis, respectively. In the first trial (N=134), treatment with either buprenorphine 5, 10, or 20 g/hr or a combination of oxycodone and acetaminophen was compared to placebo in patients with low back pain. Differences in the mean change from baseline for \"pain on average\" and \"pain right now\", the two primary endpoints, between the buprenorphine transdermal system and the placebo groups were significant for the maintenance period (P=0.04 and P=0.045, respectively). However, differences between placebo and oxycodone and acetaminophen combination, the active control, were not significant (P value not reported). When the trial was evaluated using pain scores at week 12 (an analysis preferred by the FDA), the buprenorphine transdermal system treatment group did not yield a signifi cant difference from placebo (P value not reported). In another trial (N=418), treatment with either buprenorphine transdermal system 20 g/hr or oxycodone immediate- release was compared to buprenorphine transdermal system 5 g/hr in patients with osteoart hritis. The decrease in the average pain score over the last 24 hours scores from baseline, the primary endpoint, was greater in the buprenorphine transdermal system 20 g/hr and oxycodone immediate- release treatment groups as compared to the buprenorphine transdermal system 5 g/hr group, but did not achieve significance (P values not reported). Furthermore, none of the results of the sensitivity analyses were significant, supporting the conclusion that this trial lacked assay sensitivity and is a failed t rial. 1,79 Two smaller, double- blind, crossover trials compared buprenorphine transdermal system to placebo in patients with chronic low back pain. In both trials, patients were randomized to receive buprenorphine transdermal system or placebo for four weeks and crossed over to alternate treatments at the end of week 4 for a total of eight weeks. In the first trial (N=79), the treatment difference between buprenorphine 5 to 20 g/hour and placebo in the average pain score over the last week at the end of each treatment phase, the primary endpoint, was small but statistically significant when reported using a five- point ordinal scale (P=0.0226). When the same endpoint was reported using a visual analogue scale, there was no Therapeutic Class Review: opioids (long-acting) Page 7 of 106 Copyright 2015 Review Completed on 05/04/2015 statistically significant differen ce between the two treatment groups (P=0.0919).35 In the second trial (N=78), the difference in average pain score over the last 24 hours for buprenorphine 10 to 40 g/hour was significantly lower compared to placebo when reported using both the visual analogue scale and the five-point ordinal scale (P=0.005 and P=0.016, respectively).36 In total, 18 clinical pharmacology trials and 15 chronic pain trials have been completed with buprenorphine transdermal system. Overall, there is a consistent pattern of pain reduction or continuing stable pain control in chronic, non- cancer, non- neuropathic pain models, supporting the analgesic efficacy of buprenorphine transdermal system. 79 Fentanyl transdermal systems have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of neuropathic pain, moderate to severe chronic pain due to nonmalignant and malignant disease, and moderate to severe osteoarthritis pain in both open- label and placebo- controlled trials. 37-39 The effectiveness of fentanyl in relieving pain also appears to be similar to that of morphine sulfate sustained- release for the treatment of cancer and noncancer pain, and chronic lower back pain. Compared to morphine sulfate sustained- release, fentanyl transdermal systems appear to be associated with less constipation.44-46 Hydrocodone ER has demonstrated safety and efficacy in a phase III placebo controlled trial. The trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of hydrocodone ER in opioid -experienced adults with moderate to severe chronic low back pain in a 12 week double- blind, multicenter, randomized, placebo- controlled trial. 302 subjects were randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive either hydrocodone ER or placebo after a conversion/titration phase of up to six weeks in length to establish each subject's appropriate dose of hydrocodone ER. The primary endpoint evaluated was the change in mean pain intensity score from baseline to end of treatment, which was based on the 11- point numerical rating scale that was recorded daily in an electronic diary. The numerical rating scale scores ranged from zero to ten, with zero equal to \"no pain\" and ten equal to the \"worst pain imaginable.\" The secondary endpoints measured were \"treatment responders,\" defined by the percentage of subjects with at least a 30% average improvement in pain intensity scores from baseline to end of treatment and subject satisfaction with their pain medication, measured by the mean increase in Subject Global Assessment of Medication scores from baseline to end of treatment. The Subject Global Assessment of Medication is conducted by asking subjects, \"How satisfied are you with your pain medicine?\" The answers accepted are \"not \"moderately,\" \"very much\" and \"completely\". The answers are given a score of 1 to 5, respectively, and a higher Subject Global Assessment of Medication indicated greater satisfaction with subjects' treatments. Mean change from baseline to end of treatment in pain intensity score \u00b1 SD was significantly lower for hydrocodone ER vs placebo (0.48 \u00b1 1.56 vs to 0.96 \u00b1 1.55, respectively; P=0.008). There was a significantly higher amount of treatment responders in the hydrocodone ER group compared to the placebo group (68% vs 31%, respectively; P<0.001) at the end of treatment, and Subject Global Assessment of Medication scores increased from baseline significantly in the hydrocodone ER group compared to placebo (0.8 \u00b1 1.3 vs 0.0 \u00b1 1.4, respectively; P<0.0001). 47 The available published clinical trial information demonstrating the efficacy and safety of hydromorphone ER is currently limited. In a placebo- controlled trial, the medication demonstrated superior efficacy in the treatment of lower back pain with regards to reducing pain intensity (P<0.001) and pain scores (P<0.01). In addition, treatment was well tolerated. 50 In a 2007 noninferiority analysis of a hydromorphone ER formulation available only in Europe compared to oxycodone ER, it was demonstrated that the two agents provided similar pain relief in the management of osteoarthritic pain.49 Methadone has demonstrated \"superior\" efficacy over placebo for the treatment of nonmalignant neuropathic pain and similar efficacy compared to slow -release morphine sulfate for the treatment of cancer pain. 53,54 A trial comparing different long- acting formulations of morphine sulfate for the treatment of osteoarthritis pain demonstrated that both Avinza \u00ae (morphine sulfate ER) and MS Contin\u00ae (morphine sulfate ER) significantly reduced pain from baseline (P0.05 for both). In addition, both treatments reduced overall arthritis pain intensity, and achieved comparable improvements in physical functioning and stiffness. Each of the treatments statistically improved certain sleep parameters compared to placebo, and when Therapeutic Class Review: opioids (long-acting) Page 8 of 106 Copyright 2015 Review Completed on 05/04/2015 compared head- to-head; Avinza\u00ae, administered in the morning, s ignificantly improved overall quality of sleep compared to MS Contin\u00ae (P value not reported).49 In another cross -over trial, morphine sulfate (MS Contin\u00ae) was compared to treatment with fentanyl transdermal systems. In this trial, more patients preferred treatment with fentanyl (P<0.001), and reported on average, lower pain intensity scores than during the morphine sulfate phase (P<0.001).57 Clinical trial data evaluating the combination long acting opioid agent morphine/naltrexone is limited. As mentioned previously, this product was recalled by the manufacturer due to not meeting a pre- specified stability requirement during routine testing in March 2011. 29 Morphine/naltrexone has demonstrated significantly better pain control compared to placebo in patients with osteoarthritis pain.60 Oxycodone ER has demonstrated \"superior\" efficacy over placebo for the treatment of neuropathic pain and chronic refractory neck pain.61-63 For the treatment of cancer pain, no significant differences were observed between oxycodone ER and morphine sulfate ER in reducing pain intensity. The average number of rescue doses used within a 24 hour period was significantly less with morphine sulfate ER (P=0.01), and the incidence of nausea and sedation were similar between treatments.64 Oxymorphone ER has established safety and efficacy in the management of cancer pain. 66,67 Specifically, the agent produced comparable mean daily pain intensity scores compared to both morphine sulfate and oxycodone ER for the treatment of chronic cancer pain. Patients were initially stabilized on morphine sulfate or oxycodone ER and then switched to treatment with oxymorphone ER. The average scheduled daily dose of st udy drug and average total daily dose decreased after patients crossed over to oxymorphone ER. No significant changes were observed in mean visual analog pain scores, quality of life domains, or quality of sleep for any of the treatment groups. 67 In another placebo- controlled trial, oxymorphone ER demonstrated \"superior\" efficacy for the treatment of osteoarthritis pain.68 The efficacy and safety of tapentadol ER was evaluated in three placebo- controlled and active controlled comparator trials along with one 52- week long- term safety trial. Afilalo et al conducted a 12- week randomized, double- blind, multicenter, active- and placebo- controlled trial among adults (N=1,030) with osteoarthritis of the knee who were assigned to receive tapentadol ER or oxycodone ER (titrated to response) or placebo. Significant pain relief was achieved with tapentadol ER vs placebo, with a least squares mean (LSM) difference of - 0.7 (95% confidence interval [CI], -1.04 to -0.33) at week 12 of the maintenance period compared to placebo. Comparatively, the average pain intensity rating at endpoint compared to baseline with oxycodone ER was reduced significantly compared to placebo for the overall maintenance period (LSM difference vs placebo: -0.3), but was not significantly lower at week 12 of the maintenance period (LSM of -0.3; P values not reported). The percentage of patients who achieved 30% reduction from baseline in average pain intensity at week 12 of the maintenance period was not significantly different between tapentadol ER and placebo (43.0 vs 35.9%; P=0.058), but was significantly lower for oxycodone ER compared to placebo (24.9 vs 35.9%; P=0.002). Tapentadol ER resulted in a significantly higher percentage of patients achieving 50% reduction in average pain intensity from baseline at week 12 of the maintenance period vs placebo (32.0 vs 24.3%; P=0.027) compared to treatment with oxycodone ER which resulted in a reduction vs placebo of 17.3 vs 24.3% (P=0.023). 70 Buynak et al evaluated the efficacy of tapentado l ER compared to placebo in a prospective, double- blind, placebo controlled, active comparator trial with oxycodone ER in adults (N=981) with moderate to severe lower back pain. Throughout the 12 week maintenance period, average pain intensity scores (prim ary endpoint) improved in both the tapentadol ER and oxycodone ER groups relative to placebo. The mean change in pain intensity from baseline to week 12 was -2.9 for tapentadol ER and -2.1 for placebo, resulting in a LSM difference vs placebo of -0.8 (P<0.001). The mean change in pain intensity from baseline over the entire maintenance period was -2.8 for the tapentadol ER group and -2.1 for the placebo group, corresponding to a LSM difference vs placebo of -0.7 (P< 0.001).71 Schwartz et al evaluated the efficacy of tapentadol ER in a 12 week, randomized, double- blind, placebo- controlled, maintenance trial among adults (N=395) with at least a six month history of painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy. The LSM change in average pain intensity from the start of double- blind treatment to week 12 (primary endpoint) was 1.4 in the placebo group, indicating a worsening in pain intensity, and 0.0 in the tapentadol ER group, indicating no change in pain intensity, corresponding to a LSM difference of -1.3 (95% CI, -1.70 to -0.92; P<0.001). The mean changes in average pain intensity scores from baseline to Therapeutic Class Review: opioids (long-acting) Page 9 of 106 Copyright 2015 Review Completed on 05/04/2015 week 12 among those receiving tapentadol ER were similar regardless of gender, age (<65 years or >65 years), and history of previous opioid use. At least a 30% improvement in pain intensity was observed in 53.6% of tapentadol ER -treated patients and 42.2% of placebo- patients (P=0.017) at week 12; and 50% impr ovement in pain intensity was observed in 37.8% of tapentadol ER-treated patients and 27.6% of placebo- treated patients.68 Wild et al evaluated the long- term safety of tapentadol ER in a randomized, active- controlled, open- label, trial compared to oxycodon e ER among adults with chronic knee or hip osteoarthritis or low back pain. The proportion of patients who completed treatment in the tapentadol ER and oxycodone ER groups were 46.2 and 35.0%, respectively, with the most common reason for discontinuation in both treatment groups being adverse events (22.1 vs 36.8%). Overall, 85.7% of patients in the tapentadol ER group and 90.6% of patients in the oxycodone ER group experienced at least one adverse event. The most commonly reported events (reported by >10% in either treatment group) were constipation, nausea, dizziness, somnolence, vomiting, headache, fatigue, and pruritus. The incidences of constipation (22.6 vs 38.6%), nausea (18.1 vs 33.2%), vomiting (7.0 vs 13.5%), and pruritis (5.4 vs 10.3%) were lower in the tapentadol ER group than in the oxycodone ER group, respectively. There were no clinically -relevant, treatment -related effects on laboratory values, vital signs, or electrocardiogram parameters were observed. Adverse events led to discontinuation in 22.1% of patients in the tapentadol ER group and 36.8% of patients in the oxycodone ER group. The incidence of gastrointestinal events (i.e., nausea, vomiting, or constipation) that led to discontinuation was lower in the tapentadol ER group than in the oxycodone ER group (8.6 vs 21.5%, respectively). The incidence of serious adverse events was low in both the tapentadol ER and oxycodone ER groups (5.5 vs 4.0%, respectively). 73 The efficacy of the combination product oxycodone/acetaminophen efficacy was e stablished in a clinical trial evaluating its effectiveness at treating pain over the 48 hours after surgery. Singla et al concluded that pain, evaluated by the summed pain intensity difference (SPID) score, was significantly higher in the oxycodone/acetam inophen group (P<0.001) through that time period. Mean total pain relief values for oxycodone/acetaminophen and placebo from 0 to 48 hours were 91.3 and 70.9, respectively, resulting in a treatment difference of 20.5 (95% CI, 11.0 to 30.0; P<0.001). The median time to perceptible pain relief for oxycodone/acetaminophen was 33.56 minutes vs 43.63 minutes for placebo ( P=0.002). The median times to confirmed pain relief and meaningful pain relief for the oxycodone/acetaminophen group were 47.95 minutes and 92.25 minutes; however, neither of these metrics could be determined for the placebo group ( P<0.001). The percentage of patients reporting at least a 30% reduction in pain intensity after two hours was 63.1% for oxycodone/acetaminophen compared to 27.2% for placebo ( P<0.0001). 77 Methadone is the only long -acting narcotic that is FDA -approved for the management of opioid addiction; however, in one study slow -release morphine sulfate demonstrated noninferiority to methadone in terms of completion rate for the treatment of opioid addiction (51 vs 49%).78 Therapeutic Class Review: opioids (long-acting) Page 10 of 106 Copyright 2015 Review Completed on 05/04/2015 Table 4. Clinical Trials Study and Drug Regimen Study Design and Demographics Sample Size and Study Duration End Points Results Moderate to Severe Pain Study HYD300233 (abstract) Hydrocodone ER tablets 20 to 120 mg QD vs placebo Opioid -na\u00efve patients started at 20 mg QD while opioid- experienced patients received 25% to 50% of their incoming opioid total daily dose. Doses were up- titrated every three to five days until stable or at the maximum 120 mg QD. Oxycodone IR 5 to 10 mg every four to six hours was allowed. A pre - randomization phase consisted of DB, MC, PC, RCT Patients 18 years of age with non-malignant, non-neuropathic moderate to severe low back pain for at least three months not adequately controlled by their stable incoming analgesic non-opioid or opioid (100 mg oxycodone equivalent) regimen and to have demonstrated adequate analgesia and acceptable tolerability with hydrocodone ER treatment during the run- in period N=588 12 weeks Primary: Weekly mean pain intensity score calculated using the daily \"average pain over the last 24 hours\" scores for chronic low back pain at week 12 Secondary: Response to treatment , sleep disturbance MOS Sleep -R) at weeks 4, 8, and 12, and PGIC at end of study , safety Primary: Mean (SD) \"average pain over the last 24 hours\" score at baseline in the placebo group was 7.4 (1.19) and 7.4 (1.13) in the hydrocodone ER group. Pre- randomization mean scores for the placebo and hydrocodone ER groups were 2.8 (1.15) and 2.8 (1.16), respectively. At the end of the 12- week study period, LS mean scores increased to 4.23 (0.126) and 3.70 (0.128) for the placebo and hydrocodone ER groups respectively. LS mean (SD) difference was -0.53 (0.180) (95% CI, -0.882 to -0.178; P=0.0016). Secondary: A statistically significant difference in favor of hydrocodone ER compared to placebo was seen between treatment groups for the proportion of patients with a 30% reduction in pain (P= 0.0033) and a 50% reduction in pain (P=0.0225). Improvements in pain 30% and 50% were seen in 65% and 48% of the hydrocodone ER patients and 53% and 39% of the placebo patients, respectively. MOS Sleep -R sleep disturbance subscale analysis showed that, by the end of the run- in period, the sleep disturbance subscale showed improvements in both treatment groups (from 44.72 at baseline to 51.48 at end of run in for placebo and 44.38 at baseline to 50.33 at end of run- in for hydrocodone ER); however, there was no significant difference between the two groups during the double- blind period. The proportion of patients reporting \"very much improved\" or \"much improved\" on the PGIC rating scale was significantly higher (61%) in the hydrocodone ER treatment group compared with the placebo group (49%) (P=0.0036). Treatment emergent adverse events that occurred at an incidence of 5% during the run-in period included: gastrointestinal disorders (nausea, vomiting, and constipation) and nervous system disorders (dizziness, headache, and somnolence). Treatment emer gent adverse events that occurred at an incidence of 5% during the double- blind period included only gastrointestinal disorders (nausea and vomiting). The Treatment emergent adverse events that occurred more frequently in patients receiving hydrocodone ER than in patients receiving placebo a nd those with a difference of 2% included nausea, vomiting, and influenza.

At randomization patients continued hydrocodone ER or received placebo (double- blind period). Confirmed diversion or suspected diversion by patients in either the run -in period or double- blind period was reported for 39 patients (4.3%). Few patients (1%) experienced adverse events associated with opioid withdrawal during opioid conversion or during cessation of hydrocodone ER treatment.

When the pain score was reported using the VAS, the score was 40.2\u00b120.2 for buprenorphine and 44.4\u00b120.2 for placebo (P=0.0919). Secondary: In the per -protocol analysis, when buprenorphine was compared to placebo at the last week of each treatment phase, there were no treatment differences with regard to improvement in any of the subscales or the total score of the PDI (results not repor ted; P=0.4860), the Pain and Sleep Questionnaire (172.4\u00b1122.8 vs 178.2\u00b1112.6; P value not reported), the level of activity (43.8\u00b123.0 vs 43.9\u00b123.7; P=0.9355) or the SF -36 (results not reported; P value not reported). There was no difference between the two treatment groups in patient - and investigator - rated treatment effectiveness at the end of each treatment phase. The patient -rated scores were 1.3\u00b11.1 and 0.9\u00b11.0 for buprenorphine and placebo, respectively (P=0.1782), while the investigator -rated scores were 1.2\u00b11.0 and 0.9\u00b11.0, respectively (P=0.1221).

Similarly, 43% of investigators preferred buprenorphine for their patients, 36% of investigators preferred placebo and 21% of investigators had no preference (P=0.5371). More patients reported drowsiness with buprenorphine compared to placebo (P=0.0066). More patients reported at least one adverse event during treatment with buprenorphine compared to placebo (P=0.0143). The most commonly reported adverse events include nausea, somnolence and application site reactions. ES Phase: Forty -two of 51 patients (82%) who completed the DB phase continued to receive OL buprenorphine treatment. The average PI score over the past 24 hours measured by VAS were significantly lower at the end of the ES phase compared to the DB phase (13.2\u00b120.2 vs 39.5\u00b119.1; P=0.0001). There were no differences between the ES and DB phases in the average pain score over the last week and all other study endpoints, with the exception of the standardized physical component of the SF -36, which was significantly lower in the ES phase compared to the DB phase (P=0.0226).

When reported using VAS, the pain score was 44.6\u00b121.4 for buprenorphine and 52.4\u00b124.0 for placebo (P=0.005). The score reported using the five- point scale was 2.0\u00b10.7 and 2.2\u00b10.8 for buprenorphine and placebo, respectively (P=0.016). Secondary: The overall score of the Pain and Sleep Questionnaire was significantly lower for buprenorphine compared to placebo (117.6\u00b1125.5 vs 232.9\u00b1131.9; P=0.027). No significant differences were noted between the two treatment groups with regard to the PDI and SF -36 (P value not reported for all endpoints). The treatment effectiveness of buprenorphine was rated significantly higher than placebo by patients (1.8\u00b11.1 vs 1.0\u00b11.1; P=0.016) and investigators (1.8\u00b11.1 vs 1.0\u00b11.1; P=0.013).

There were statistically significant differences in favor of buprenorphine compared to tramadol prolonged- release with regard to patient - and inv estigator -rated global assessment of pain relief (P=0.039 and P=0.020, respectively). Ninety of 128 patients (70.3%; 95% CI, 62 to 78) preferred a once- weekly patch as a basic analgesic treatment for OA pain in the future. There were no differences between the two treatment groups in the total number of reported adverse events (P value not reported). The most commonly observed adverse events in the buprenorphine group were nausea (30.4%), 5 to 25 g/hour every 7 days plus paracetamol* 1,000 mg orally four times daily vs codeine/ paracetamol* 8/500 mg or 30/500 mg orally one or two tablets four times daily Supplemental analgesic medication was AC, MC, OL, PG, RCT Patients 60 years of age with a clinical diagnosis of OA of the hip and/or knee with severe pain and taking the maximum tolerated dose of paracetamol (four or more 500 mg tablets each day) N=220 10 weeks of titration period followed by 12 weeks of assessment period Primary: Average pain score over the last 24 hours on Box Scale -11 pain score ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad as you can imagine) Secondary: Daily number of tablets of supplemental analgesic medication, laxative use, sleep parameters on the Medical Outcome Study -Sleep Scale, time to achieve stable Primary: In the ITT analysis, the treatment difference between buprenorphine plus paracetamol and codeine/paracetamol with regard to the average daily pain score was -0.07 (95% CI, -0.67 to 0.54; P value not reported), demonstrating that buprenorphine plus paracetamol was non- inferior to codeine/paracetamol. Secondary: In the per -protocol analysis, patients receiving buprenorphine plus paracetamol required 33% fewer supplemental analgesic medications compared to those receiving codeine/paracetamol. The treatment difference was -0.98 (95% CI, -1.55 to -0.40; P=0.002). Fifty percent of patients in each treatment group required laxatives during the study (P value not reported). In the per -protocol analysis, the mean sleep disturbance score on the Medical O utcome Study -Sleep Scale decreased from 33.90\u00b122.09 at baseline to 24.30\u00b125.32 at the end of the study in the buprenorphine plus paracetamol group, while the score decreased from 41.8\u00b128.6 to 32.9\u00b126.1 in the codeine/paracetamol group (P value not reported).

There was no difference in the number of hours slept between the two groups. The number of patients with optimal sleep slightly increased in the buprenorphine plus paracetamol group and slightly decreased in the codeine/paracetamol group. The snoring score did not change with buprenorphine plus paracetamol and slightly improved with codeine/paracetamol. Neither treatment had any effect on shortness of breath, headache or somnolence (P values not reported for all parameters). The mean time to achieve stable pain control during the titration period was 19.5\u00b111.5 days for buprenorphine plus paracetamol and 21.80\u00b113.76 days for codeine/paracetamol (P value not reported). The median percentage of days on which anti -emetics were used during the titration period was 18.5% (interquartile range, 0 to 70.6) for buprenorphine plus paracetamol and 0% (interquartile range, 0 to 26.8) for codeine/paracetamol (P value not reported). Forty -three of 110 patients in the buprenorphine plus paracetamol group withdrew from the study during the titration period; 34 patients withdrew due to adverse events and five patients withdrew due to lack of therapeutic effect. In the codeine/paracetamol group, 63 of 110 patients withdrew during the titration period; 23 patients withdrew were due to adverse events and 12 patients withdrew due to lack of therapeutic effect. Eighty -six percent and 82% of patients in the buprenorphine plus paracetamol and codeine/paracetamol groups, respectively, reported treatment emergent adverse events. The most commonly reported adverse events in the buprenorphine plus paracetamol group were nausea, application site reaction and constipation.

Overall, 32.5% of patients experienced both a >30.0% decrease in PI and a >30.0% increase in activity. The effect of fentanyl on activity was that 62% of subjects experienced a >15% increase in activity levels compared to baseline, 20% showed minimal or no change ( +15%) in activity, and 18% showed a >15% reduction in activity. The average increase in activity in the three subgroups was 42.6%, 37.5% and 33.3%, respectively, in patients with peripheral neuropathy, CRPS, and postamputation pain.

The lowest starting dose, 12.5 \u00b5g/hour, was considered appropriate for 59 patients (29.6%). The average duration of treatment with fentanyl in the primary treatment period was 14.80 +0.25 days in the ITT patient group. A total of 84.9% of patients received at least one rescue medication, with a mean oral morphine equivalent of 1.35 +0.16 mg/kg during the primary treatment period. The average daily PI levels reported by parents/guardians using the numeric pain scale for the ITT population decreased steadily throughout the study period from 3.50+ 0.23 at baseline to 2.60 +0.21 by day 16. Parent/guardian- rated improvements in mean PPS scores were observed from baseline (41.22 +1.68) to the data collection endpoint (53.80 +1.91), resulting in a mean change of Therapeutic Class Review: opioids (long-acting) Page 17 of 106 Copyright 2015 Review Completed on 05/04/2015 Study and Drug Regimen Study Design and Demographics Sample Size and Study Duration End Points Results 11.5%. At the end of month one of the extension phase (n=36), parents reported improvement in 11/12 domains assessed by the CHQ with the largest improvement noted in bodily pain (29.52\u00b14.52; baseline, 18.14). Other domains demonstrating an improvement of greater than five points from baseline include mental health (8.28\u00b12.76; baseline, 54.33), family activities (6.96\u00b13.19; baseline, 43.04), role emotional behavior (12.36\u00b16.08; baseline, 34.72), physical function (7.15\u00b12.71; baseline, 23.65) and role physical (13.82\u00b15.76; baseline, 17.07). At the end of month three, participating patients continued to demonstrate sustained improvements in 11/12 domains. One hundred eighty patients (90.5%) reported at least one adverse event during treatment. The most frequent adverse events were fever (n=71 patients), emesis (n=66 patients), nausea (n=42 patients), headache (n=37 patients) and abdominal pain (n=34 patients).

Pain control was achieved within 1.7 days after the start of therapy. PI significantly decreased from baseline through the remaining weekly evaluations (P<0.001). Significant differences in doses were observed after two weeks and were almost doubled at four weeks. The mean fentanyl escalation index was 4.04% and 0.012 mg, respectively. No differences in fentanyl escalation index were found when considering the pain mechanism and primary cancer. The pain mechanism did not significantly affect the changes in PI and doses of fentanyl. The mean fentanyl escalation index was similar in patients presenting difference pain mechanisms. There were significant changes in opioid- related symptoms and quality of life between weekly evaluations.

The average individual PI, evaluated by the patients, decreased from 7.02 to 2.86 (59.3%; P<0.001). The pain intensities evaluated by the patients, at rest and when moving, were decreased from 5.40 to 1.95 (63.9%; P<0.0001). Secondary: Within three visits, the sum of patients who answered \"very satisfied\" or \"satisfied\" w as 76.8, 83.7, and 93.0%, respectively. Differences in the sums of the rates of 'very satisfied' and \"satisfied\" measured in week four and the rates on the last visit constituted a significant increase (P<0.05). The determinants of the patient's satisfacti on with pain treatment were (in order of frequency): efficacy of pain treatment is good, satisfied overall, and convenient. Investigators' satisfaction with the pain treatment was also evaluated and the sum of the rates of \"very satisfied\" and \"satisfied\" on each visit was 83.7, 83.7, and 86.0%. Following treatment, each function of daily life, walking, and eating due to pain showed a decrease as follows: from 7.30 to 3.07, from 6.58 to 2.86, and from 3.33 to 0.35, respectively (P<0.001). Rate of patients whose sleep was not disturbed increased from 32.6% in the first evaluation to 86.1% in the fifth evaluation (P<0.0001). The average dose administered was 13.95 g/hour upon initial administration and 42.59 g/hour at the termination of the trial (P<0.001). In 55 patients, more than one adverse event was observed during the trial. Nausea was observed in 32 patients, dizziness in 28 patients, drowsiness in 20 patients, constipation in 11 patients, and vomiting in 10 patients. In general all events were mild. There were 18 patients who discontinued the trial due to adverse events.

The overall WOMAC score and the pain score were significantly better in the fentanyl group (P=0.009 and P=0.001), while stiffness and physical functioning scores showed non- significant trends in favor of fentanyl (P=0.051 and P=0.064). Significant ly more patients who received fentanyl than those who received placebo reported that the transdermal systems definitely met their overall expectations (28 vs 17%; P=0.003). When asked to compare the study medication with previous treatments, significantly more patients who received fentanyl considered it to provide much better or somewhat better relief than other pain medication (fentanyl, 60% vs placebo, 35%; P<0.001). Not all of the individual domains of the SF -36 quality of life assessment showed signif icant improvements from baseline, although the physical functioning, pain index, and physical component scores improved significantly in both groups (all P<0.05 vs baseline). Scores on the SF -36 pain index were significantly better for patients receiving fentanyl (P=0.047), whereas changes in the mental component scores showed a small, but statistically significant, benefit in those receiving placebo (1.1 +0.7; P=0.041). Ahmedzai et al44 Fentanyl transdermal system replaced every hours for 15 days vs morphine SR (MST -Continus TM) every 12 hours for 15 days MC, OL, RCT, XO Patients 18 to 89 years of age with cancer who required strong opioid analgesia and were receiving a stable dose of morphine for 48 hours N=202 30 days Primary: Pain control, effect on sedation and sleep, bowel function, treatment preference and adverse events Secondary: Not reported Primary: No significant differences on any of the pain scales were detected between the fentanyl and morphine phases. During the fentanyl phase, patients used more rescue medications than during the morphine phase. Rescue medication was used for 53.9% of days during treatment with fentanyl, compared to 41.5% of days for morphine (P=0.0005) throughout the whole of the phases. A sizeable proportion of patients required upward titration of study medication (47.1% required 1 fentanyl dose change and 27.4% required 1 morphine dose change). One patient required a downward titration in fentanyl dose. Fentanyl was associated with significantly less dayt ime drowsiness than morphine (mean percent area under the 34.0; 95% CI, 29.1 to 38.9; vs 43.5; 95% CI, 38.5 to 48.5; respectively, as assessed by VAS in the patient diaries). Data from the EORTC questionnaire showed significantly less sleep disturbance with morphine (mean scores, 32.4; 95% CI, 26.9 to 37.9; vs 95% CI, 17.8 to 27.1; for fentanyl and morphine, respectively). The only difference in diary data was that patients reported shorter sleep duration when on fentanyl compared to when on morphine over the whole 15- day treatment period (mean, 8.1; 95% CI, 7.9 to 8.3 hours; vs 8.3; 95% CI, 8.0 to 8.5 for Therapeutic Class Review: opioids (long-acting) Page 20 of 106 Copyright 2015 Review Completed on 05/04/2015 Study and Drug Regimen Study Design and Demographics Sample Size and Study Duration End Points Results morphine). Fentanyl treatment was associated with significantly less constipation than morphine (P<0.001). At the end of the trial, significantly more patients indicated that fentanyl had caused less interruption to their daily activities, and the activities of family and care takers, and had been more convenient to take than the morphine tablets. The percentages expressing preference were as follows: less interruption of daily activities, 55.2% fentanyl; 22.3% morphine. Of the 202 patients who entered the study, 136 felt able to express an opinion about the two treatments. Of these, 14 (10%) had no preference, 73 (54%) preferred fentanyl, and 49 (36%) preferred the morphine tablets (P=0.037). The EORTC quality of life questionnaire revealed no other significant dif ferences between the two treatments. When scores for nausea and vomiting were separated, the mean score for nausea was significantly lower in the fentanyl group (1.7; 95% CI, 1.5 to 1.8; vs 1.8; 95% CI, 1.7 to 2.0; P=0.04). Although more adverse events were reported during fentanyl treatment, the end of treatment questionnaire indicated that significantly fewer patients considered that fentanyl caused adverse events compared to morphine (40.4 vs 82.5%; P<0.001).

Mean VAS scores at study endpoint was 56.0\u00b11.5 and 55.8\u00b11.5 for fentanyl and morphine. Based on the 95% CI, the difference between groups established noninferiority ( -3.9 to 4.2). After one week of treatment, pain relief was evident with VAS scores being 58.5\u00b11.3 and 59.9\u00b11.4 for fentanyl and morphine. Fentanyl was associated with significantly less constipation than morphine. Baseline levels of constipation were similar, but at endpoint 31% of fentanyl Class Review: opioids (long-acting) Page 21 of 106 Copyright 2015 Review Completed on 05/04/2015 Study and Drug Regimen Study Design and Demographics Sample Size and Study Duration End Points Results morphine SR 30 mg every 12 hours; dosage was titrated based on pain levels assessment, investigator's overall assessment of disease progression, number of working days lost and adverse events Secondary: Mean SF -36 quality of life scores improved to a similar extent in both treatment gr oups between baseline and endpoint for all domains of overall physical health (P<0.001), physical functioning, role- physical, bodily pain, vitality, social functioning and role- emotional. However, the scores for overall mental health did not change signifi cantly from baseline to endpoint in either group (P=0.937 for fentanyl and P=0.061 for morphine). The mean dose of fentanyl on day one was 25 \u00b5g/hour (range 25 to 50 \u00b5g/hour) and the mean dose at study end was 57 \u00b5g/hour (range 12.5 to 250 \u00b5g/hour). The mean dose of morphine on day one was 58 mg (range 6 to 130 mg) and the mean dose at study end was 140 mg (range 6 to 780 mg). The proportion of patients who improved by at least one pain category (e.g., from severe to moderate) during the course of the trial was 50 to 70% in both treatment groups. While patients in the fentanyl group improved more than the patients in the morphine group for pain during the day and pain at rest, the groups improved to a similar degree for pain on movement and pain at night. The dose of supplemental medication for breakthrough pain did not differ significantly between the treatment groups. Investigator ratings of disease progression were similar across treatment groups. At endpoint, investigators considered that 49% of fentanyl and 45% of morphine patients had stable disease; 10 and 8%, respectively, had deteriorated and 21 and 23%, respecti vely, had improved. Based on the number of patients with jobs, loss of working days was applicable to a small population of patients. The proportion of patients reporting >3 weeks off at baseline decreased from 34 and 25% of fentanyl and morphine to 16% for both groups. No differences between treatment groups in patients with lower back pain were observed. Most participants (95%) reported at least one adverse event during the study. The proportion of patients receiving fentanyl and morphine who reported adverse events that were considered to be at least possibly related to the trial medication were 87 and 91%. Adverse events led to discontinuation of trial medication in 37% of the fentanyl group and 31% of the morphine group (P=0.098). The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation were nausea (37% of discontinuations in each group), opioids (long-acting) Page 22 of 106 Copyright 2015 Review Completed on 05/04/2015 Study and Drug Regimen Study Design and Demographics Sample Size and Study Duration End Points Results Clark et al46 Fentanyl transdermal system, initially 25 g/hour every 72 hours, with dosage adjustments to achieve adequate pain control vs morphine SR, initially 15 to 30 mg every 12 hours, with dosage adjustments to achieve adequate pain control Systematic review (8 trials) Patients 18 years of age with defined and documented chronic non-cancer pain (including lower back pain, pain due to rheumatoid arthritis, or OA of the knee or hip) or cancer pain, that had reached a stage requiring treatment with a strong opioid N=2,525 28 days to 13 months Primary: Pain results and adverse events Secondary: Not reported Primary: Treatment with fentanyl and morphine was equally effective in improving average pain from baseline to Day 28 (mean changes in scores were -21.8 and -20.6, respectively). In the subgroup analysis, both treatments were similarly effective in improving the average pain scores ( -24.5 vs -25.9, respectively in the cancer pain subgroup and -21.0 and - 17.7, respectively in the non- cancer pain subgroup). Improvements in pain \"right now\" scores between baseline and day 28 were significant for both treatment groups, and for both cancer pain patients and non- cancer pain patients (all measures P<0.001). The changes in pain \"right now\" from baseline to day 28 were significantly greater in the fentanyl treatment group compared to the morphine treatment group in the total patient sample (P=0.017). The cancer pain subgroup showed a similar trend towards better pain relief from baseline to day 28 with fentanyl treatment but this was not statistically significant (P=0.171) . Overall the type of pain did not influence the incidences of adverse events. However, in the total patient sample, as well as in both pain type subgroups, significantly fewer adverse events occurred in the fentanyl treatment group compared to the morphi ne treatment group (all measures P<0.001). Additionally, serious adverse events were also reported significantly less frequently in the fentanyl treatment group (P=0.006). The highest rate of serious adverse events was reported in patients with cancer pain and included 61 deaths. Constipation was the most commonly reported adverse event in the morphine treatment group, and significantly fewer patients reported nausea during the first 28 days of treatment with fentanyl compared to morphine (P<0.001). Patient s treated with fentanyl also reported less somnolence compared to morphine- treated patients (P<0.001).

Secondary: The change from baseline in PI over the entire 12 weeks was statistically significant for hydromorphone compared to placebo (P<0.001). A significantly larger increase in mean PI numeric rating scale scores was seen in the placebo group compared to hydromorphone (1.2 vs 0.4; P<0.001). Weekly office visit number rating scale scores showed greater improvement following treatment with hydromorphone compared to placebo beginning at visit one and continued throughout the 12 weeks of treatment. The difference between the groups was significant (P<0.05) at every office visit except week three. Discontinuations due to treatment failure occurred sooner (P<0.001) and more frequently among patients in the placebo group. The difference was apparent by two weeks and the difference in discontinuation rates increased over the entire 12 weeks of treatment. Treatment with hydromorphone significantly improved patient global assessment scores at week 12 or at the final visit (P<0.001). A higher proportion of patients rated their treatment as good, very good or excellent compared to placebo at week 12 or final v isit (80.5 vs 62.4%). The overall percentage of patients requiring rescue medication at least once over the 12 week course was similar between hydromorphone and placebo groups (96.2 vs 97.0%). The mean number of rescue medication tablets used per day at the week 12 visit also was similar between the groups (P=0.49).

Hydromorphone -treated patients showed a median change from baseline to week 12 or final visit of 0 on this measure; placebo- treated patients showed a median change of 1, indicating that placebo patients' self -reported functional status was significantly worse compared to hydromorphone (P<0.005). Significant differences were seen at weeks one, two, three, eight and 12 (or final visit). The difference between treatment groups was not statistically significant at weeks four, six or ten. A significantly higher proportion of patients in the placebo group discontinued the study compared to patients in the hydromorphone group (67.2% [90/134] vs 50.7% [68/134]; P<0.01). 8 to 64 mg QD vs oxycodone ER 10 to 80 mg BID MC, OL, PG Patients 18 years of age who met ACR clinical criteria for OA of the knee or hip for 3 months before enrollment, with a mean daily pain rating at the affected joint of moderate to severe, despite chronic use of stable doses (30 days with no regimen change) of NSAIDs or other nonsteroidal, nonopioid therapies (with or without as -N=147 6 weeks Primary: Mean pain relief score at end point Secondary: Change from baseline to end point in the mean pain relief score; mean PI score at end point; change from baseline to end point in mean PI score; change from baseline to end point in mean total daily dose of study medication; change from baseline to end point in mean daily number of tablets of study medication; and changes from visit one to subsequent Prima ry: The mean (SD) pain relief score was 2.30 (0.95) in the hydromorphone group and 2.30 (1.00) in the oxycodone group. The 1- sided 95% CI for the difference of means was - 0.30 to infinity. Secondary: The mean changes in pain relief from baseline to end point are reported in graphic form; as such the results could not be accurately interpreted. The mean time to the third day of moderate to complete pain relief was 6.20 (4.00) days in the hydromorphone group and 5.50 (2.57) days in the oxycodone group. The 1- sided 95% CI for the difference of means was -0.31 to infinity. The mean (SD) changes in PI from baseline to end point were -0.6 (0.80) points in the hydromorphone ER group and -0.4 (1.15) in the oxycodone ER group; the 1- sided 95% CI for the difference of means was -0.53 to infinity. The results of the patient and investigator global evaluations indicated that both treatments were considered clinically effective. Patient global evaluations improved from baseline by a mean (SD) of 1.20 (1.01) points in the hydromorphone group and by 1.00 (1.33) points in the oxycodone group. The magnitude of change was not significantly different between groups. The overall effectiveness of treatment was rated as good, very good or excellent by 67.2% of patients in the hydromorphone group and 66.7% of patients in the oxycodone group. The mean patient global evaluation scores at end point were similar in the two groups (2.90 [1.06] and 2.90 [1.11], respectively).

Quigley et al50 Hydromorphone, long- or short - acting vs strong opioids, long- or short - acting or placebo or non- opioids MA (48 RCTs) Patients of any age suffering from any illness with either acute or chronic pain, including cancer pain and postoperative pain N=3,293 Duration not reported Primary: Pain relief and safety Secondary: Not reported Primary: Overall, studies varied in quality and methodology. The review did not demonstrate any clinically significant difference between hydromorphone and other strong opioids. Compared to meperidine, hydromorphone appeared more effective in achieving acute pain relief without an increase in adverse events. For the treatment of chronic pain, two studies showed that hydromorphone ER and morphine ER achieved similar pain relief; however, one of the studies showed that patients taking hydromorphone ER required more doses of rescue medication and were more likely to experience withdrawal compared to morphine. Diarrhea was more commonly seen with hydromorphone. No significant differences were seen in other adverse events. In studies comparing hydromorphone to morphine for the treatment of acute pain, hydromorphone- to morphine equianalgesic ratio was shown to vary from 7:1 to 5:1 for parenteral and spinal administration. Both drugs were associated with nausea, sleepiness and pruritus.

One study comparing patient - controlled hydromorphone, morphine and sufentanil showed that morphine was superior with regard to time to treatment failure and was associated with the lowest incidence of adverse events. No significant differences were seen in chronic pain relief between hydromorphone ER and oxycodone SR. One study showed that transmucosal fentanyl led to greater improvement in pain and anxiety compared to hydromorphone. Studies comparing different formulations and/or routes of administration of hydromorphone found no differences in chronic pain relief bet ween IR vs ER tablets, subcutaneous bolus vs subcutaneous infusion, intravenous vs subcutaneous and oral vs intramuscular. For the treatment of acute pain, epidural hydromorphone was associated with higher incidence of pruritus compared to intravenous or i ntramuscular hydromorphone. For the treatment of acute pain, hydromorphone IR was associated with greater pain relief compared to placebo, and there were no significant differences in adverse events between hydromorphone and placebo. One study showed that subcutaneous hydromorphone and intravenous indomethacin were equally effective in pain relief, although the duration of nausea and vertigo was longer following hydromorphone. Secondary: Not reported Felden et al51 Hydromorphone vs morphine MA (11 RCTs) Patients with acute or chronic pain N=1,215 Duration not specified Primary: Pain relief and adverse events Secondary: Not reported Primary: Hydromorphone was associated with greater acute pain relief compared to morphine (pooled standard mean difference, -0.226; P=0.006). No differences were observed for the treatment of chronic pain relief (P=0.889). The overall incidences of nausea, vomiting and pruritus were comparable between the two opioids. When the four studies on chronic pain were analyzed separately, hydromorphone was associated with less nausea (P=0.005) and vomiting (P=0.001).

Overall, the review supported the use of hydromorphone in the treatment of moderate to severe cancer pain as an alternative to morphine and oxycodone. There was no clinically significant difference between hydromorphone and morphine. The majority of the studies showed similar safety and efficacy in pain relief between hydromorphone and morphine or oxycodone. The following agents of different formulations were found comparable in safety and efficacy: hydromorphone IR vs morphine IR; hydromorphone IR vs intramuscular morphine In one non- RCT, hydromorphone SR was shown to have similar analgesia with more vomiting and less constipation compared to transdermal fentanyl and bupre norphine. Two studies comparing hydromorphone IR to SR demonstrated similar pain relief and safety profile between the two formulations. Other studies comparing different routes of administration of hydromorphone also showed similar safety and efficacy between the following routes: intravenous vs subcutaneous, intravenous vs oral and intramuscular vs oral.

Morphine ER in the morning (26%) and in the evening (22%) and morphine CR BID (22%) reduced overall arthritis PI as compared to placebo (14%), but these differences were not statistically significant. PI (measured on a 100- mm scale) was reduced by approximately 20 to 23 mm in the morphine ER and CR groups compared to 14 mm in the placebo group. Decreases in PI were apparent in all treatment groups by week one and further reductions in pain throughout the four week period were observed as compared to baseline. Secondary: Statistically significant differences in physical function were not achieved among the treatment groups. Mean improvements in physical function (total score, 0 to 1,700 mm) at Week four were as follows: morphine ER in the morning (207 mm, 18%) and in the evening (205 mm, 19%), morphine CR (181 mm, 14%) and placebo (97 mm, 8%). Reductions in stiffness were also observed for all treatment groups. The changes were not large enough to achieve statistical significance.

Morphine ER in the morning provided statistically significant improvements compared to placebo for overall quality of sleep, less need for sleep medication, increases hours of sleep and less trouble falling asleep because of pain (P values not reported). Morphine ER in the evening provided statistically significant improvements compared to placebo for overall quality of sleep and duration of sleep each night. Relative to placebo, morphine CR provided statistically significant improvements in overall quality of sleep and patients had less trouble falling asleep because of pain (P values not reported). Morphine ER in the morning demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in overall quality of sleep compared to morphine CR (P value not reported) and no significant differences were observed between morphine ER in the morning and the evening (P value not reported). A total of 197 patients (67%) experienced at least one adverse event during this trial, with constipation and nausea reported most frequently. Adverse events were higher in all active treatment groups compared to the placebo group. Among the 33 pair -wise comparisons the only significant differences observed were a higher rate of constipation with morphine ER in the morning (49%) vs morphine CR (29%), a higher rate of vomiting with morphine ER in the evening (16%) vs morphine ER in the morning (6%) and a higher rate of asthenia with morphine CR (9%) vs morphine ER in the morning (1%). Allan et al57 Morphine (MS Contin\u00ae) 10 to 200 mg for 4 weeks vs fentanyl transdermal system 25 to 100 g/hour for 4 weeks MC, OL, RCT, XO Patients > 18 years of age with chronic non-cancer pain requiring continuous treatment with potent opioids for six weeks preceding the trial, who achieved moderate pain N=256 8 weeks Primary: Patient preference Secondary: Pain control and treatment assessment, rescue drug use, SF-36 quality of life, and safety Primary: Preference could not be assessed in 39 of 251 patients, leaving a total of 212 patients for analysis. A higher proportion of patients preferred or very much preferred fentanyl to morphine (138 [65%] vs 59 [28%]; P<0.001). Preference for fentanyl was not significantly different in patients with nociceptive, neuropathic or mixed nociceptive and neuropathic pain. The predominant reason for preferring fentanyl was better pain relief. Secondary: Patients treated with fentanyl reported on average lower PI scores than those treated with morphine (57.8 [range, 33.1 to 82.5] vs 62.9 [range, 41.2 to 84.6]; P<0.001), irrespective of the order of treatment. More patients receiving fentanyl considered their pain control to be good or very good vs those receiving morphine (35 vs 23%; P=0.002). Investigators' opinion of global efficacy for fentanyl was good or very good in 58% (131/225) of patients compared to 33% (75/224) of patients receiving morphine (P<0.001).

Analysis of the consumption of rescue drug during the last three weeks of each treatment period showed that the mean (SD) consumption was significantly higher with fentanyl than with morphine (29.4 [33.0] mg vs 23.6 [32.0] mg; P<0.001). A significant period effect was also observed: the higher consumption during fentanyl treatment was more apparent in the second trial period (32.4 [38.5] mg) than the first (26.3 [26.0] mg), where the consumption of the rescue drug remained essentially the same over the two treatment periods in the morphine group (23.7 [35.3] mg vs 23.6 [27.3] mg). Patients receiving fentanyl had higher overall quality of life scores than patients receiving morphine in each of eight categories measured by the SF -36. Differences were significant in bodily pain (P<0.001), vitality (P<0.001), social functioning (P=0.002), and mental health (P=0.020). The overall incidence of treatment related adverse events was similar in both groups as was the proportion of patients with adverse events. Fentanyl was associated with a higher incidence of nausea (26 vs 18%) but less constipation (16 vs 22%). Wiffen et or non-opioid analgesics MA (54 RCTs) Adults and children with cancer pain requiring opioid treatment N=3,749 3 days to 6 weeks Primary: Pain relief and adverse events Secondary: Not reported Primary: The review showed that morphine was comparable to other opioids in achieving cancer pain relief, and different formulations of morphine were effective. Limited evidence suggested that transmucosal fentanyl may provide more rapid pain relief for breakthrough pain compared to morphine. Thirteen studies (n=939) compared long- acting morphine to other opioids of either long- or short -acting formulation. There were no significant differences in pain relief and adverse events between long- acting morphine and long- or short -acting oxycodone, long-acting hydromorphone or Pain relief was similar and transdermal fentanyl, though patients in the transdermal fentanyl group required more rescue medication and reported less sedation and constipation. Compared to methadone, morphine was associated with similar pain relief and fewer adverse events. Six studies (n=973) compared short -acting morphine to other opioids. One study comparing morphine to transmucosal fentanyl for breakthrough pain showed that PI scores were significantly lower with transmucosal fentanyl at all time points compared to morphine.

Compared to methadone, morphine was associated with more dry mouth and fewer headaches. Morphine was also associated with more nausea than oxycodone. Fifteen studies (n=460) compared long- to short -acting morphine and demonstrated that the two formulations were comparable in pain relief and adverse events. No carry -over effects were observed with long- acting morphine. One study showed long- acting morphine was associated with greater improvement in sleep quality. Twelve studies (n=1,010) compared long- acting morphine of different dosage strengths, dosing intervals or dosage formulations. Results from these studies showed no significant differences in pain relief or adverse events between the following comparisons: 12- hourly vs eight -hourly dosing, 12-h vs 12 -hour-release tablet (MS Contin\u00ae) and long- acting tablet vs long- acting suspension. One study showed that long- acting morphine suppository caused less nausea compared to long- acting morphine oral tablet. Another study showed rectal administration of morphine solution led to faster and greater pain relief compared to oral solution. In one study, oral and epidural morphine achieved similar pain relief.

No significant improvements occurred for the five remaining items which included physical function score, general activity, mood, walking ability and normal work. There were no significant differences between treatments in physical functioning, general health and mental health subscales of the SF -36 Health Survey or in the seven subscales of the Rand Mental Health Inventory. A significant difference in ambulation, a subscale of the Sickness Impact Profile, was observed between oxycodone and placebo at the final visit. Of the 12 patients discontinuing study medication due to inadequate pain control, one patient was in the oxycodone group and 11patients were in placebo group (P=0.002). The median time to achieve mild pain was shorter for the patients treated with oxycodone (six days) compared to placebo- treated patients (17 days; P=0.017). Patient treated with oxycodone had more days with mild pain: mean (SD) of 20.0 (16.6) days vs 12.5 (16.0) days for the placebo (P=0.007).

Similarly, performance status scale increased from 3.21\u00b10.68 to 4.74\u00b10.95 on day seven and to 7.23\u00b11.44 on day 28 (P<0.05). Bad quality of sleep was 63.8% before treatment and was decreased to 15.5% on day three, 8.6% on day seven, and 5.6% on day 14 in patients treated with oxycodone. Additionally, there was significant improvement in the quality of sleep, with 13.8% as the baseline for good quality of sleep, rising to 46.6%, 50.0%, and 58.3% on day three, seven and 14 respectively after oxycodone treatment (P<0.01). Adverse (18.9%) and dizziness (27.6%) were only seen on day seven of the treatment in oxycodone patients (P<0.05). However, events diminished starting from day 14 of the treatment until day 28; only two patients had persistent constipation. Most domains of SF -36 were effective positively in patients treated with oxycodone. The score for physical functioning, pain index, vitality, social functioning, emotional role and mental health index were significantly better in the oxycodone group compared to placebo at the end of the study (P <0.05).

For both formulations, there was a significant (P=0.02) difference in rescue use with respect to doses taken during the night (2 to 6 AM) as compared to the remainder of the 24-hour day. The rate of rescue use during the night was 55 and 67% of that used during the daytime in the oxycodone and morphine groups, respectively. The average daily number of rescue doses in a 24- hour period was 2.3 +2.3 for oxycodone and 1.7 +2.1 for morphine (P =0.01). There were no significant differences in sedation or nausea between oxycodone ER and morphine.

The MA included in this review showed no difference in analgesia and safety between oxycodone and morphine or hydromorphone (pooled mean difference, 0.04; CI, -0.29 to 0.36; P=0.8). Similarly, results from RCT and PRO OS also showed no difference between oxycodone and hydromorphone, morphine or oxymorphone. Studies that compared short - to long- acting oxycodone showed similar pain relief and safety profile between the two formulations. Studies comparing intravenous vs rectal and intramuscular vs oral oxycodone also demonstrated similar safety and efficacy between different routes of administration.

There was a statistically significant difference in the distribution of responder rates for patients with any degree of improvement (pre- titration to week -12) between the tapentadol ER and placebo groups (P=0.032). Of the patients who achieved 30% improvement in PI (titration phase) and were randomized to tapentadol ER treatment, 60.8% maintained 30% improvement through week 12 (maintenance phase); whereas 34.0% of patients who had not achieved at least a 30% improvement in PI (titration phase) and were randomized to tapentadol ER reached 30% improvement from pre -titration by week 12 of the maintenance period. Of those patients who were randomized to placebo after achieving 30%improvement in PI (titration phase), 48.7% of patients maintained 30% improvement through the maintenance phase, while only 17.5% of patients who were randomized to placebo and had not reached 30% improvement (titration phase) achieved 30% improvement in PI during the maintenance phase. Among patients who achieved 50% improvement in PI (titration phase) and were randomized to t reatment with tapentadol ER, 59.1% of patients maintained 50% improvement through week 12 (maintenance phase); whereas 18.0% of patients who had not achieved 50% improvement (titration phase) and were randomized to tapentadol ER reached 50% improvement from pre -titration by week 12 of the maintenance period. Among patients who were randomized to placebo after achieving 50% improvement in PI (titration phase), 36.4% of patients maintained 50% improvement through the maintenance phase, while only 16.5% of those randomized to placebo and had not reached 50% improvement during titration reached 50% improvement during the maintenance phase.

The most commonly reported events among the active treatment group were nausea, anxiety, diarrhea, and dizziness. During the maintenance phase, the overall incidence of adverse events was similar between males and females, those ages <65 years and >65 years, and among opioid-na\u00efve and opioid- experienced individuals who received tapentadol ER. Treatment -emergent serious adverse events occurred in 1.4% of tapentadol ER -treated patients in the titration phase; and among 5.1% of the tapentadol ER -treated patients and 1.6% of placebo- treated patients in the maintenance phase.

The least square mean difference was - 0.7 (95% CI, -1.04, -0.33) at week 12 of the maintenance period compared to placebo. Secondary: The least square mean difference was -0.7 (95% CI, -1.00 to -0.33) for the overall maintenance period for tapentadol compared to placebo (P -values not reported). The average PI rating with oxycodone ER was reduced significantly compared to placebo from baseline for the overall maintenance period (least square mean difference vs placebo, -0.3; 95% CI, -0.67 to 0.00), but was not statistically significantly lower at week -12 of the maintenance period ( -0.3; 95% CI, -0.68 to 0.02); P- values not reported.

The stiffness subscale assessment was improved with tapentadol ER compared to placebo with a least square mean difference of -0.17 (95% CI, -0.377 to - 0.002; P=0.053); however the difference was not statistically significant. Conversely, the least square mean difference between oxycodone ER and placebo was -0.10 (95% CI, -0.292 to 0.096; P=0.321), which also was not statistically significant. The incidence of adverse events was 61.1% with placebo, 75.9% with tapentadol ER, and 87.4% with oxycodone ER. The most common events (10% in any group) in the active treatment groups were nausea, constipation, vomiting, dizziness, headache, somnolence, fatigue and pruritus. The majority of reported events were mild to moderate in severity. Events leading to discontinuation occurred in 6.5% of patients treated with placebo, 19.2% of patients treated with tapentadol ER, and 42.7% of patients treated with oxycodone ER.

The mean change in PI from baseline over the entire maintenance period was -2.8 (2.50) for tapentadol ER and -2.1 (2.20) for placebo, corresponding to a least square mean difference vs placebo of -0.7 (95% CI, -1.06 to -0.35; P< 0.001). Secondary: The mean PI was also reduced for the oxycodone ER group. Compared to the placebo group at week 12 the least square mean difference was -0.9 (95% CI, -1.24 to -0.49; P<0.001); and over the entire maintenance period the least square mean difference was -0.8 (95% CI, -1.16 to -0.46; P<0.001). Reductions in mean PI were significantly greater with tapentadol ER than with placebo at week -12 of the maintenance period both for patients with moderate and severe baseline PI. Significantly greater reductions in mean PI with tapentadol ER compared to placebo were also observed for the overall maintenance period in patients with both moderate baseline PI and severe baseline PI. Reductions in mean PI were also significantly greater with oxycodone ER than with placebo for patients with moderate and severe baseline PI at both week 12 of the maintenance period and for the overall maintenance period. The overall distribution of responders at week 12 of the maintenance period was significantly different between the tapentadol ER group and the placebo group (P=0.004), with a higher percentage of patients showing improvements in pain scores in the tapentadol ER group than in the placebo group. The overall distribution of responders at week 12 in the oxycodone ER group, however, was not significantly different from the placebo group (P=0.090).

The percentage of patients in the oxycodone ER group with 30% improvement in PI at week -12 compared to baseline was 30.4% (P=0.365) and did not differ significantly from placebo (percent among placebo group not reported). Conversely, the percentage of patients in the oxycodone ER group with 50% improvement in PI at week -12 compared to baseline was 23.3% (P=0.174) and did not differ significantly from placebo (percent among placebo group not repor ted). At endpoint, there was a significant difference in PGIC ratings for both tapentadol ER (P<0.001) and oxycodone ER (P<0.001) compared to placebo. Compared to placebo, both tapentadol ER and oxycodone ER showed significant reductions from baseline to week -12 in the BPI total score, the pain interference subscale score, and the pain subscale score. The percentage of patients with \"any pain today other than everyday kinds of pain\" on the BPI survey at baseline was 88.6, 85.6, and 86.1% for the placebo group, tapentadol ER group, and oxycodone ER group, respectively. At week 12, the percentage scores decreased to 80.7% for the placebo group, 69.8% for the tapentadol ER group, and 67.3% for the oxycodone ER group. The percentage of patients who repor ted \"at least 50% pain relief during the past week\" was similar for all three treatment groups at baseline for the placebo, tapentadol ER, and oxycodone ER groups (23.4, 24.7, and 20.9%, respectively). These results increased to 59.7, 75.4, and 80.0% among the placebo, tapentadol ER, and placebo groups, respectively at week 12. Treatment with both tapentadol ER and oxycodone ER significantly improved physical health status compared to placebo, as reflected by the physical component summary score.

The mean chang es from baseline were significantly improved for role- physical and bodily pain scores among the oxycodone ER group compared to the placebo group. No clinically important changes in laboratory values, vital signs, or electrocardiogram findings were attributed to treatment. Overall, at least one adverse event was reported by 59.6, 75.5, and 84.8% of patients in the placebo, tapentadol ER, and oxycodone ER groups, respectively. The most commonly reported events (reported by >10% in any treatment group) were nausea, constipation, headache, vomiting, dizziness, pruritus, and somnolence, the majority of which were categorized as mild to moderate in intensity across all treatment groups. In the oxycodone ER group, the incidence of vomiting, constipation, and pruritus was nearly double incidence in the tapentadol ER group.

The maximum doses were tapentadol ER 200 mg BID and oxycodone ER 40 mg BID. Patients must not have taken opioid analgesics (other than codeine or dihydrocodeine for cough) within 28 days before screening, patients must have had pain requiring an opioid analgesic and patients must have been dissatisfied with the pain relief experienced with their current pain regimen. The mean (SD) of the average number of doses of morphine IR 5 mg per day used for breakthrough pain in the tapentadol ER group was 1.4 (0.46) compared to 1.4 (0.43) for oxycodone ER. The mean (SD) of the average total daily dose of morphine IR used was 7.0 mg (2.30) for tapentadol ER compared to 6.7 mg (2.15) for oxycodone ER. Morphine IR was used by 74.6% (N=94/126) of subjects treated with tapentadol ER compared to 74.1% (N=103/139) of subjects in the oxycodone ER group. Wild et al73 Tapentadol 100 to 250 mg BID vs oxycodone ER 20 to 50 mg BID Initial treatment with tapentadol ER 50 mg BID or oxycodone ER 10 mg BID for 3 days; AC, MC, OL, PG, RCT Men and (non-pregnant) women 18 years of age with a diagnosis of moderate to severe knee or hip OA pain or low back pain (non- malignant) with a 3 month histor y of pain, N=1,121 51 weeks (main - tenance phase) Primary: Safety and tolerability Secondary: Change in mean PI score Primary: The proportion of patients who completed treatment in the tapentadol ER and oxycodone ER groups were 46.2 and 35.0%, respectively, with the most common reason for discontinuation in both treatment groups being adverse events (22.1% for tapentadol ER vs 36.8% for oxycodone ER). Overall, 85.7% of patients in the tapentadol ER group and 90.6% of patients in the oxycodone ER group experienced at least one adverse event. The most commonly reported events (reported by >10% in either treatment group) were constipation, nausea, dizziness, somnolence, vomiting, headache, fatigue, and pruritus. The incidences of constipation (22.6 vs 38.6%), nausea (18.1 vs 33.2%), and vomiting (7.0 vs 13.5%) were lower in the tapentadol ER group than in the oxycodone ER group, respectively. The incidence of pruritis was 5.4% among the tapentadol ER -treated patients and 10.3% among oxycodone -treated clinically relevant treatment -Therapeutic Class Review: opioids (long-acting) Page 47 of 106 Copyright 2015 Review Completed on 05/04/2015 Study and Drug Regimen Study Design and Demographics Sample Size and Study Duration End Points Results then doses were increased to tapentadol ER 100 mg BID or oxycodone ER 20 mg BID for 4 days (minimum study doses); at 3- day intervals doses were increased in increments of tapentadol ER 50 mg BID or oxycodone ER 10 mg BID (max daily doses: tapentadol ER 250 mg BID or oxycodone ER 50 mg BID). Occasional pain relief with NSAIDs, aspirin doses 325 mg/day for cardiac prophylaxis, and acetaminophen 1,000 mg/day (up to a max of 7 consecutive days and no more that 14 out of 30 days) were permitted. who were dissatisfied with current analgesic therapy, and had a PI score 4 on an 11-point rating scale after therapy washout related effects on laboratory values, vital signs, or electrocardiogram parameters were observed. Adverse events led to discontinuation in 22.1% of patients in the tapentadol ER group and 36.8% of patients in the oxycodone ER group. The incidence of gastrointestinal events (i.e., nausea, vomiting, or constipation) that led to discontinuation was lower in the tapentadol ER group than in the oxycodone ER group (8.6 vs 21.5%, respectively). The incidence of serious adverse events was low in both the tapentadol ER and oxycodone ER groups (5.5 vs 4.0%, respectively). Among those who reported constipation, the mean change from baseline to endpoint was lower for patients in the tapentadol ER group than for those in the oxycodone ER group as well as for the overall rectal and overall stool subscale scores. Secondary: Baseline mean PI scores at endpoint among the tapentadol ER and oxycodone ER groups decreased to 4.4 and 4.5 from the baseline scores of 7.6 and 7.6, respectively. Ratings on the global assessment of study medication of \"excellent,\" \"very good,\" or \"good\" among the tapentadol ER and oxycodone ER groups were reported by the majority of patients (75.1 and 72.3%, respectively) and investigators (77.3 and 72.3%, respectively). The most commonly reported rating on the PGIC at endpoint was \"much improved\" for both the tapentadol ER and oxycodone ER groups (35.7 and 32.8%, respectively). A rating of \"very much improved\" \"much was reported y. al (2011)74 Strong Systematic review (56 RCTs) N=not reported 24 hours Primary: Change of PI Secondary: Primary: Morphine vs another strong opioids One trial favored other opioids, one trail favored morphine, and the remaining eight trials did not find any difference between the two treatments. In the subgroup of trials with a Therapeutic Class Review: opioids (long-acting) Page 48 of 106 Copyright 2015 Review Completed on 05/04/2015 Study and Drug Regimen Study Design and Demographics Sample Size and Study Duration End Points Results vs placebo or strong opioids Patients 18 years of age with cancer - related or non-cancer -related chronic pain Safety duration between one week and o ne month, morphine was more effective than other opioids (eight trials: weighted mean difference, -5.8; 95% CI, - 9.5 to -2.1). Other differences were not significant. Network analyses showed that fentanyl (weighted mean difference, 6.3; 95% CI, 1.8 to 10.9) and hydromorphone (weighted mean difference, 5.1; 95% CI, 0.5 to 9.6) were less effective compared to morphine. Also placebo was less effective (weighted mean difference, 10.7; 95% CI, 7.2 to 14.1). No differences with morphine were found for oxycodone (weighted mean difference, 2.9; 95% CI, -0.4 to 6.2), methadone (weighted mean difference, 3.3; 95% CI, -4.6 to 11.3), oxymorphone (weighted mean difference, 0.4; 95% CI, -5.5 to 6.3) and buprenorphine (weighted mean difference, 3.0; 95% CI, - 3.0 to 9.0). Differences between morphine and fentanyl and between morphine and hydromorphone were not (3.6; CI, -2.0 to 9.3 and 4.8; 95% CI, -0.1 to 9.8). No differences were found when excluding trials examining opioids in neuropathic pain. Secondary: No difference between morphine and other strong opioids were found for risk of treatment discontinuation due to any reasons (ten trials: RR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.88 to 1.29), treatment discontinuation due to lack of efficacy (nine trials: RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.55 to 1.25), or treatment discontinuation due to adverse events (nine trials: RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.67 to 1.65). Network analyses showed no difference between morphine and any other strong opioid or placebo in treatment discontinuation when all reasons for discontinuation were pooled. Patients using buprenorphine and those using placebo are more likely to discontinue treatment due to lack of efficacy (OR, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.37 to 3.95; OR, 4.12; 95% CI, 2.66 to 6.38). Patients using methadone are more likely to discontinue due to adverse events (OR, 3.09; 95% CI, 1.14 to 8.36), whereas this risk is decreased for patients using fentanyl (OR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.17 to 0.50), buprenorphine (OR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.16 to 0.53), and placebo (OR, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.08 to 0.18). After excluding trials with reversed design, oxymorphone showed increased risk for treatment discontinuation for any reason (OR, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.49 to 3.63) whereas this was nonsignificant in the overall analysis (OR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.70 to 1.44). Therapeutic Class Review: opioids (long-acting) Page 49 of 106 Copyright 2015 Review Completed on 05/04/2015 Study and Drug Regimen Study Design and Demographics Sample Size and Study Duration End Points Results No differences were found when excluding trials examining opioids in neuropathic pain. Three trials comparing morphine to another strong opioid reported serious adverse events; no differences in risk was found in the pair -wise MA (RR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.67). The network analysis also found no difference in risk of serious adverse events for patients using morphine compared to those using oxycodone, fentanyl, placebo, buprenorphine, oxymorphone, and hydromorphone. Limitations: Patients with non- cancer pain and cancer pain were included; therefore, differences in patient populations exist among included trials. Some trials included patients with moderate pain which may not require a strong opioid. Use of RCTs is less suitable for evaluating adverse events, and the majority of trials were industry funded. Conclusion: Current evidence is moderate, both in respect to the number of directly comparative trials and in the quality of reporting of these trials. No clear superiority in efficacy and tolerability of morphine over other opioids was found in pair -wise and network analyses. Based on these results, a justification for the placement of morphine as the reference standard for the treatment of severe chr onic pain cannot be supported. Whittle et al75 Opioids vs placebo, opioids or NSAIDs MA (11 RCTs) Patients 18 years of age with a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis N=672 <24 hours (four studies) 1 to 6 weeks (seven studies) Primary: Percentage of patients with pain relief 30% and number of withdrawals due to adverse events Secondary: Percentage of patients with pain relief 50% , changes in function, quality of life, withdrawals due to inadequate Primary: Data from the four single- dose studies were not included in the MA. A review of these studies showed that single- dose all associated with greater pain relief compared to placebo. No significant differences in efficacy were found between these agents. Five of the remaining seven studies that were at least one week in duration compared codeine/acetaminophen, morphine CR, pentazocine, tilidine/naloxone and tramadol/ acetaminophen to placebo. One study compared dextropropoxyphene/aspirin to aspirin, and one study compared codeine/acetaminophen plus diclofenac to diclofenac. None of these studies reported data on percentage of patients with pain relief of 30%. The rate of withdrawal due to adverse events was higher with opioids but not significantly different from placebo (RR, 2.67; 95% CI, 0.52 to 13.75). Therapeutic Class Review: opioids (long-acting) Page 50 of 106 Copyright 2015 Review Completed on 05/04/2015 Study and Drug Regimen Study Design and Demographics Sample Size and Study Duration End Points Results analgesia and adverse events Secondary: One study showed that 60% of patients receiving codeine/acetaminophen achieved 50% pain relief compared to 26% with placebo (RR, 2.28; 95% CI, 0.99 to 5.25). Three studies showed that opioids were associated with greater improvement in CGI within the first six weeks compared to placebo (RR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.03 to 2.03; NNT, 6). There were no significant differences between opioids and placebo with regard to changes in function, as measured by HAQ (weighted mean difference, -0.10; 95% CI, - 0.33 to 0.13). One study showed that codeine/acetaminophen led to a greater improvement in self -reported disability scale compared to placebo (P=0.04). The number of withdrawals due to inadequate analgesia was similar between opioids and placebo (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.34 to 2.01).The risk of adverse events was higher in patients receiving opioids compared to patients receiving placebo (OR, 3.90; 95% CI, 2.31 to 6.56; NNH, 4). The most commonly reported adverse events were nausea, vomiting, dizziness, lightheadedness and constipation.When a net efficacy was adjusted for risk, opioids provided no additional benefit compared to placebo (RR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.61). Moreover, there were no significant differences in efficacy and safety between opioids and NSAIDs. Eisenberg et al76 Opioids vs placebo, opioids or non-opioid analgesics MA (23 RCTs) Patients 18 years of age with neuropathic pain N=727 Short -term: <24 hours (14 8 70 (nine RCTs) Primary: Change in PI Secondary: Safety Primary: Among the 14 short -term studies (n=267), the following opioids were compared to placebo: morphine, alfentanil, fentanyl, meperidine and codeine. Six trials showed greater pain relief with opioids compared to placebo; five trials showed equivalent efficacy between opioids and placebo; two trials demonstrated mixed efficacy and one trial showed a reduction in the affective but not the sensory component of pain. MA was performed on six trials and showed that opioids were associated with a lower PI score by 16 points on a 100- point VAS compared to placebo (95% CI, -23 to -9; P<0.001). When analyzed separately for peripheral and central pain, the diff erences in PI between opioids and placebo were 15 (95% CI, -23 to -7; P<0.001) and 18 points (95% CI, -30 to -5; P=0.006), respectively. MA on two trials using percentage of pain reduction showed an additional 26% reduction in pain with opioids vs placebo (95% CI, 17 to 35; P<0.00001). Among the nine intermediate- term studies (n=460), placebo: morphine, of the Therapeutic Class Review: opioids (long-acting) Page 51 of 106 Copyright 2015 Review Completed on 05/04/2015 Study and Drug Regimen Study Design and Demographics Sample Size and Study Duration End Points Results trials also compared opioids to carbamazepine, nortriptyline, desipramine and gabapentin. Two of the trials compared different dosages of the same opioid, including methadone and levorphanol. MA of seven studies showed PI score was 13 points lower with opioids than placebo (95% CI, -16 to -9; P<0.00001). Evoked PI was measured in two studies, which showed that PI was 24 points lower with opioids than placebo (95% CI, -33 to -15). Two studies showed a 6- point reduction in PI with morphine or methadone compared to non- opioid analgesics (95% CI, -12 to 0). A dose -dependent analgesic effect was found with methadone and levorphanol (P values not reported). Secondary: When comparing opioids to placebo, there was a higher incidence of nausea (33 vs 9%; NNH, 4.2; 95% CI, NNH, 4.2; 95% NNH, 6.2; 95% 6%; NNH, 7.1; 95% CI, 5.0 11.1) and vomiting (15 vs 3%; NNH, 8.3; 95% CI, 5.6 to 14.3). In four intermediate- term studies, 11 and 4% of patients in the opioid and placebo groups withdrew due to adverse events (NNH, 16.7; 95% CI, 9.1 to 100.0).

From 0 to 4 hours, oxycodone/ acetaminophen ER had a mean TOTPAR value of 6.8 versus 3.4 for placebo, resulting in a treatment difference of 3.4 (95% CI, 2.4 to 4.4; P<0.001). Mean TOTPAR values from 0 to 12 hours for oxycodone/ acetaminophen and placebo were 16.5 and 11.2, respectively, which resulted in a treatment difference of 5.3 (95% CI, 2.9 to 7.7; P<0.001). The mean TOTPAR value for oxycodone/ acetaminophen ER from 0 to 24 hours was 38.4 versus 26.8 for placebo, resulting in a treatment difference of 11.6 (95% CI, 7.1 to 16.2; P<0.001).

From 12 to 24 hours, the mean TOTPAR value for oxycodone/acetaminophen ER was 2 1.9 versus 15.6 for placebo, resulting in a treatment difference of 6.3 (95% CI, 3.4 to 9.2; P<0.0001). From 24 to 36 hours, the mean TOTPAR value for oxycodone/ acetaminophen ER was 25.8 versus 20.7 for placebo, which resulted in a treatment difference of 5.2 (95% CI, 2.1 to 8.2; P=0.0009). The mean TOTPAR value for oxycodone/ acetaminophen ER from 36 to 48 hours was 27.1 versus 23.4 for placebo, resulting in a treatment difference of 3.7 (95% CI, 0.4 to 7.0; P=0.0276). The median time to perceptible pain relief for oxycodone/ acetaminophen ER was 33.56 minutes vs 43.63 minutes for placebo ( P=0.002). The median times to confirmed pain relief and meaningful pain relief for the oxycodone/ acetaminophen ER group were 47.95 minutes and 92.25 minutes; however, neither of these metrics could be determined for the placebo group ( P<0.001).

According to the prior -defined non -inferiority margin of -15%, morphine is non methadone for detoxification. Therapeutic Class Review: opioids (long-acting) Page 53 of 106 Copyright 2015 Review Completed on 05/04/2015 Study and Drug Regimen Study Design and Demographics Sample Size and Study Duration End Points Results vs methadone Patients continued their previous maintenance treatment for 3 consecutive days and then were randomized to treatment based on previous drug for maintenance treatment and dose level. Dose reduction regimens were started and maintained for 3 consecutive days under DB conditions. Thereafter, detoxification was initiated by tapered dose reductions over a period of 16 days in order to reach abstinence for 3 days. with a confirmed diagnosis of opioid addiction, who have received maintenance treatment with either morphine slow-release or methadone at constant doses for 1 month Secondary: Patient -reported outcomes and safety Secondary: At study entry, signs and symptoms of withdrawal were mild but deteriorated steadily over time (day 0 vs day 22; P<0.001). Craving for opiates varied considerably but was generally rated as moderate. No changes became evident during the detoxification phase and there were no significant differences between treatment groups over time, respectively (morphine: day 0, 35.4\u00b135.1 mm; P=0.813). Cravings for alcohol, cocaine and cannabis were low throughout detoxification without any significant differences between groups or over time (P values not reported). The proportion of patients reporting at least one adverse event was 16 and 13% in the morphine and methadone groups (P=0.586). The majority of adverse events were gastrointestinal system disorders (nausea, vomiting, and dentalgia), followed by psychiatric disorders (dysphoria, agitation, depression and panic attacks). *Synonym for acetaminophen.

A ssess each patient's risk prior to prescribing B utrans\u00ae, and monitor all patients regularly for the development of these behaviors or conditions . Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life- threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur with use of Butrans\u00ae. Monitor for respiratory depression, especially during initiation of Butrans\u00ae or following a dose increase. Misuse or abuse of Butrans\u00ae by chewing, swallowing, snorting or injecting buprenorphine extracted from the transdermal system will result in the uncontrolled delivery of buprenorphine and pose a significant risk of overdose and death. Accidental Exposure Accidental exposure to even one dose of B utrans\u00ae, especially by children, can result in a fatal overdose of buprenorphine. Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Prolonged use of Butrans\u00ae during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life- threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the pati ent of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available . Boxed Warning for Duragesic\u00ae (Fentanyl )2 WARNING Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Duragesic\u00ae exposes patients and other users to the risks of opioid addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Assess each patient's risk prior to prescribing D uragesic\u00ae, and monitor all patients regularly for the development of these behaviors or conditions . Life-Threatening Respiratory De pression Serious, life- threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur with use of Duragesic\u00ae, even when used as recommended. Monitor for respiratory depression, especially during initiation of Duragesic\u00ae or following a dose increase. Because of the risk of respiratory depression, Duragesic\u00ae is contraindicated for use as an as -needed analgesic, in non- opioid tolerant patients, in acute pain, and in postoperative pain. Accidental Exposure Deaths due to a fatal overdose of fentanyl have occurred when children and adults were accidentally exposed to Duragesic\u00ae. Strict adherence to the recommended handling and disposal instructions is of the utmost importance to prevent accidental exposure. Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Therapeutic Class Review: opioids (long-acting) Page 68 of 106 Copyright 2015 Review Completed on 05/04/2015 WARNING Prolonged use of Duragesic\u00ae during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life- threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available. Cytochrome P450 3A4 Interaction The concomitant use of Duragesic\u00ae with all cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. In addition, discontinuation of a concomitantly used cytochrome P450 3A4 inducer may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentration. Monitor patients receiving Duragesic\u00ae and any CYP3A4 inhibitor or inducer . Exposure To Heat Exposure of the D uragesic\u00ae applica tion site and surrounding area to direct external heat sources, such as heating pads or electric blankets, heat or tanning lamps, sunbathing, hot baths, saunas, hot tubs, and heated water beds may increase fentanyl absorption and has resulted in fatal over dose of fentanyl and death. Patients wearing D uragesic\u00ae systems who develop fever or increased core body temperature due to strenuous exertion are also at risk for increased fentanyl exposure and may require an adjustment in the dose of D uragesic\u00ae to avoid overdose and death. Boxed Warning to Zohydro\u00ae (hydrocodone ER)3 WARNING Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Zohydro ER\u00ae exposes patients and other users to the risks of opioid addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Assess each patient's risk prior to prescribing Zohydro ER\u00ae, and monitor all patients regularly for the development of these behaviors or conditions. Life-threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life- threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur with use of Zohydro ER\u00ae. Monitor for respiratory depression, especially during initiation of Zohydro ER\u00ae or following a dose increase. Instruct patients to swallow Zohydro ER\u00ae capsules whole; crushing, chewing, or dissolving Zohydro ER capsules can cause rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of hydrocodone. Accidental Exposure Accidental consumption of even one dose of Zohydro ER\u00ae, especially by children, can result in a fatal overdose of hydrocodone. Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome For patients who require opioid therapy while pregnant, be aware that infants may require treatment for neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome. Prolonged maternal use of Zohydro ER \u00ae during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life- threatening and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Interaction with Alcohol Instruct patients not to consume alcoholic beverages or use prescription or non- prescription products that contain alcohol while taking Zohydro ER\u00ae. The co- ingestion of alcohol with Zohydro ER\u00ae may result in increased plasma levels and a potentially fa tal overdose of hydrocodone .

Assess each patient's risk prior to prescribing Hysingla ER\u00ae, and monitor all patients regularly for the development of these behaviors or conditions . Life-threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life- threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur with use of Hysingla ER\u00ae. Monitor for respiratory depression, especially during initiation of Hysingla ER\u00ae or following a dose increase. Instruct patients to swallow Hysingla ER\u00ae tablets whole; crushing, chewing, or dissolving Hysingla ER\u00ae tablets can cause rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of hydrocodone. Accidental Ingestion Accidental ingestion of even one dose of Hysingla ER\u00ae, especially by children, can result in a fatal overdose of hydrocodone.

Life-threatening QT Prolongation QT interval prolongation and serious arrhythmia (torsades de pointes) have occurred during treatment with methadone. Most cases involve patients being treated for pain with large, multiple daily doses of methadone, although cases have been reported in patients receiving doses commonly used for maintenance treatment of opioid addiction. Closely monitor patients for changes in cardiac rhythm during initiation and titration of Dolophine\u00ae/Methadose\u00ae. Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Prolonged use of Dolophine\u00ae/Methadose\u00ae during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life -threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts.

Conditions For Distribution And Use Of Methadone Products For The Treatment Of Opioid Addi ction For detoxification and maintenance of opioid dependence, methadone should be administered in accordance with the treatment standards cited in 42 CFR Section 8, including limitations on unsupervised administration . Boxed Warning for Methadose\u00ae concentrate, dispersible tablet (methadone)9,10 WARNING Deaths have been reported during initiation of methadone treatment for opioid dependence. In some cases, drug interactions wi th other drugs, both licit and illicit, have Therapeutic Class Review: opioids (long-acting) Page 71 of 106 Copyright 2015 Review Completed on 05/04/2015 WARNING been suspected. However, in other cases, deaths appear to have occurred due to the respiratory or cardiac effects of methadone and too- rapid titration without appreciation for the accumulation of methadone over time. It is critical to understand the pharmacokinetics of methadone and to exercise vigilance during treatment initiation and dose titration. Patients must also be strongly cautioned against self -medicating with CNS depressants during initiation of methadone treatment. Respiratory depression is the chief hazard associated with methadone hydrochloride administration. Methadone's peak respiratory depressant effects typically occur later, and persist longer than its peak analgesic effects, particularly in the early dosing period. These characteristics can contribute to cases of i atrogenic overdose, particularly during treatment initiation and dose titration. Cases of QT interval prolongation and serious arrhythmia (torsades de pointes) have been observed during treatment with methadone. Most cases involve patients being treated for pain with large, multiple daily doses of methadone, although cases have been reported in patients receiving doses commonly used for maintenance treatment of opioid addiction.

The risk syndrome (e.g., agitation, altered consciousness, ataxia, myoclonus, overactive reflexes, shivering) may be increased. Dosage and Administration When selecting an individualized initial dose for any of the long- acting opioids , taking into account the patient's prior opioid and non- opioid analgesic treatment, consideration should be given to the general condition and medical status of the patient , the daily dose, potency and kind of analgesic(s) the patients has been taking, the reliability of the conversion estimate used to calculate the dose of the new long- acting opioid , the patient's opioid exposure and opioid tolerance (if any) , any safety issues associated with the specific long- acting opioid, and the balance between pain control and adverse outcomes. The specific dosing for each of long- acting opioids are listed in Table 10 below .1-18 Buprenorphine patch and f entanyl transdermal systems are intended for transdermal use only and should be applied to intact, nonirritated, nonirradiated skin on a flat surface. The application site should be hairless, or nearly hairless, and if required hair should be clipped not shaven. 1-2 Buprenorphine pat ches are applied for a 7- day cycle on the right or left outer arm, upper chest, upper back or side of chest. T he same location for application should not be reused within 21 days.1 Each fentanyl system may be worn continuously for 72 hours on areas such as the chest, back, flank or upper arm and then removed and dispose d of immediately . The next fentanyl transdermal system should be applied to a different skin site.2 Buprenorphine should be applied to the right or left outer arm, upper chest, upper back or side of chest.1 If problems with adhesion to either occur, the edges may be taped with first aid tape. If problems with lack of adhesion continue, waterproof or semipermeable adhesive dressings or transparent adhesive film dressing may be used on buprenorphine patches or fentanyl transdermal systems respectively .1-2 Most solid, long-acting opioid formulations ( e.g., tablets, capsules) should be swallowed whole and should not be broken, chewed, cut, crushed, or dissolved before swallowing. 1-18 The only exceptions are the morphine- containing capsules (Avinza\u00ae, Kadian\u00ae and Embeda\u00ae); all can be opened and the pellets sprinkled on applesauce and then swallowed whole.11,12 ,17 Kadian\u00ae pellets can also be placed in 10 mL of water and used through a 16 French gastrostomy tube.12 Neither Avinza\u00ae, Kadian\u00ae, nor Embeda\u00ae pellets may be used thorough a nasogastric tube.11,12 ,17 It is recommended to give only one Zohydro ER\u00ae Therapeutic Class Review: opioids (long-acting) Page 82 of 106 Copyright 2015 Review Completed on 05/04/2015 (hydrocodone) capsule, at a time.3,4,14-16 Almost all oral, long- acting opioids are dosed twice daily. Exalgo\u00ae capsules and Embeda\u00ae (morphine/naltrexone) capsules can to be administered once or twice daily.12,17 MS Contin\u00ae (morphine) tablets or all methadone formulations are dosed twice or three times daily.6-10,13 The remaining long- acting agents are dosed the only long- acting opioids with a maximum daily dose. Avinza\u00ae (morphine) has a max dose of 1,600 m g/day due to the capsules being formulated with fumaric acid, which at that dose has not been shown to be safe and effective and may cause renal toxicity11. Xartemis XR\u00ae (oxycodone/acetaminophen) is limited to four tablets per day, or if taking other acetaminophen products, a maximum of 4,000 mg/day .18 Differences in pharmacokinetics result in differences in how often the dose of an opioid may be titrated upward. Each long- acting opioid has a certain time period before which a dose titration can occur. The amount of time required before dose titration can occur can range from one to s even days. The specific times required for titration are listed in Table 10.1-18 When switching between agents, an appropriate dose conversion table must be used. When discontinuing any long- acting opioid without starting another, always use a slow taper to prevent severe withdrawal symptoms . Methadone differs from many of the other long- acting opioids due to pharmacokinetic properties ; high interpatient variability in absorption, metabolism , and relative analgesic potency. For these reasons, it is necessary that a cautious and highly individualized approach to prescribing methadone is practiced.6-10 The concentrate and dispersible tablet s are only indicated for the detoxification treatment or maintenance treatment of opioid addiction.9,10 When methadone is used for the treatment of opioid addiction in detoxification or maintenance programs, it is only to be dispensed by opioid treatment programs certified by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration and approved by the designated state authority.

Clinical Guidelines The current clinical guidelines regarding the use of opioids recognize their established efficacy in the treatment of moderate to severe pain. None of the available agents are distinguished from the others in the class, and recommendations for treatment are made for the class as a whole. In terms of specific etiologies of pain, opioids are recognized as a possible treatment option for the treatment of noncancer pain, osteoarthritis pain, lower back pain, gout pain and neuropathic pain. Only weak opioids are recommended for the treatment of pain associated with fibromyalgia; strong opioids are not recommended in these patients . Specific to the long- acting opioids, proposed benefits of these agents when adminis tered around- the- clock include more consistent control of pain, improved adherence, and lower risk of abuse or addiction; however, to date, no well- conducted clinical trials have clearly proven these benefit s. Table 11. Clinical Guidelines Clinical Guideline Recommendations Treatment Guidelines from The Medical Letter: Drugs for Pain \u00b7 Nociceptive pain can be treated with nonopioid analgesics or opioids. \u00b7 Neuropathic pain is less responsive to opioids and is often treated with adjuvant drugs such as antidepressants and antiepileptics. Therapeutic Class Review: opioids (long-acting) Page 87 of 106 Copyright 2015 Review Completed on 05/04/2015 Clinical Guideline Recommendations (2013)24 \u00b7 Combining different types of analgesics may provide an additive analgesic effect without increasing adverse events. \u00b7 Nonopi oid analgesics such as aspirin, acetaminophen and NSAIDs are preferred for initial treatment of mild to moderate pain. \u00b7 For moderate acute pain, most NSAIDs are more effective than aspirin or acetaminophen and some have shown equal or greater analgesic eff ect than an oral opioid combined with acetaminophen, or even injected opioids. The selective cyclooxygenase- 2 inhibitor celecoxib appears to cause less severe gastrointestinal toxicity compared to non- selective NSAIDs. \u00b7 Moderate pain that does not respond to nonopioids can be treated with a combination of opioid and nonopioid analgesics. \u00b7 For treatment of most types of severe pain, full opioid agonists are the drugs of choice. Unlike NSAIDs, morphine and the other full agonists generally have no dose ceiling for their analgesic effectiveness except that imposed by adverse events. \u00b7 Patients who do not respond to one opioid may respond to another. Meperidine use should be discouraged because of the high rate of central nervous system (CNS) toxicity and the availability of less toxic, longer - acting alternatives. \u00b7 Tolerance to most of the adverse events of opioids, including respiratory and CNS depression, develops at least as rapidly as tolerance to the analgesic effect; tolerance can usually be surmounted and adequate analgesia restored by increasing the dose. \u00b7 When frequent dosing becomes impractical, long- acting opioids may be helpful. National Comprehensive Cancer Network: Adult Cancer Pain (2014) 80 \u00b7 Pain is one of the most common symptoms associated with cancer. \u00b7 The most widely accepted algorithm for the treatment of cancer pain was developed by the World Health Organization which suggests that patients with pain be started on acetaminophen or a nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drug (NSAID). If sufficient pain relief is not achieved, patients should be escalated to a \"weak opioid\" and then to a \"strong opioid\", such as morphine. \u00b7 This guideline is unique it that it contains the following components: o In order to maximize patient outcomes, pain is an essential component of oncology management. o There is an increasing amount of evidence that survival is linked to effective pain control. o Analgesic therapy must be administered in conjunction with management of multiple symptoms or symptom clusters and complex pharmacologic therapies that patients with cancer are generally prescribed. o Pain intensity must be quantified by the patient (whenever possible), as the algorithm bases therapeutic decisions on a numerical value assigned to the severity of pain. o A formal comprehensive pain assessment must be performed. o Reassessment of pain intensity must be performed at specified intervals to ensure that the therapy selected is having the desired effect. o Persistent cancer pain often requires treatment with regularly scheduled analgesics with supplemental doses of analgesics provided as needed to manage breakthrough pain. o A multidisciplinary team may be needed for comprehensive pain Therapeutic Class Review: opioids (long-acting) Page 88 of 106 Copyright 2015 Review Completed on 05/04/2015 Clinical Guideline Recommendations management. o Psychosocial support must be available. o Specific educational material must be provided to the patient. \u00b7 The pain management algorithm distinguishes three levels of pain intensity, based on a zero to 10 numerical rating scale: severe pain (seven to 10), moderate pain (four to six) and mild pain (one to three). \u00b7 Pain associated with oncology emergency should be addressed while treating the underlying condition. \u00b7 Patients considered to be opioid tolerant are those who are taking >60 mg oral morphine/day, 25 \u00b5g transdermal fentanyl/hour, 30 mg oral oxycodone/day, 8 mg oral hydromorphone/day, 25 mg oral oxymorphone/day or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid for one week or longer. Patients not meeting this definition are considered opioid na\u00efve. \u00b7 Opioid na\u00efve patients (those not chronically receiving opioid therapy on a daily basis) should be provided with non- opioid adjuvant analgesics as indicated, prophylactic bowel regimen, psychosocial support as well as patient and family education. \u00b7 Opioid na\u00efve patients (those not chronically receiving opioid therapy on a daily basis) experiencing severe pain should receive rapid titration of short -acting opioids. \u00b7 Opioid -na\u00efve patients whose pain intensity is moderate at presentation, the pathways are quite similar to those for severe pain, with slower titration of short -acting opioids. \u00b7 Opioid -na\u00efve patients experiencing mild pain intensity should receive nonopioids analgesics, such as NSAIDs or acetaminophen or treatment with consideration of slower titration of short -acting opioids. \u00b7 Patients wi th chronic persistent pain controlled by stable doses of short - acting opioids should be provided with round- the-clock extended release or long acting formulation opioids with provision of a 'rescue dose' to manage break -through or transient exacerbations of pain. Opioids with rapid onset and short duration as preferred as rescue doses. The repeated need for rescue doses per day may indicate the necessity to adjust the baseline treatment. \u00b7 Optimal analgesic selection will depend on the patient's pain intensit y, any current analgesic therapy, and concomitant medical illness(es). \u00b7 In a patient who has not been exposed to opioids in the past, morphine is generally considered the standard starting drug of choice at an initial oral dose of 5 to 15 mg. \u00b7 Morphine and hydromorphone should be used with caution in patients with fluctuating renal function due to potential accumulation of renally cleared metabolites that may cause neurologic toxicity. \u00b7 Pure agonists (fentanyl, morphine, oxycodone, and oxymorphone) are the most commonly used medications in the management of cancer pain. \u00b7 Due to the ease of titration, opioid agonists with a short half -life are fentanyl, hydromorphone, morphine, and oxycodone. Transdermal fentanyl is not indicated for rapid opioid titration and only should be recommended after pain is controlled by other opioids in opioid tolerant patients. It is usually the drug of choice for patients who are unable to swallow, patients with poor tolerance to morphine, and patients with poor compliance. \u00b7 Transmucosal fentanyl may be considered in opioid- tolerant patients for brief episodes of incident pain not attributed to inadequate dosing of Therapeutic Class Review: opioids (long-acting) Page 89 of 106 Copyright 2015 Review Completed on 05/04/2015 Clinical Guideline Recommendations around -the-clock opioid. \u00b7 Individual variations in methadone pharmacokinetics make using this agent in cancer pain difficult. Methadone should be started at lower -than- anticipated doses and slowly titrated upwards with provision of adequate short acting breakthrough pain medications during the titration period. Methadone use should be initiated by physicians with experience and expertise in its use. \u00b7 At a maximum dose of 400 mg/day, tramadol is less potent than other opioids and is approximately 1/10 as potent as morphine. \u00b7 Meperidi ne, mixed agonist -antagonists, and placebos are not recommended for cancer patients. Meperidine is contraindicated for chronic pain especially in patients with impaired renal function or dehydration. \u00b7 The least invasive, easiest and safest route of administration should be provided to ensure adequate analgesia. Oral administration is preferred for chronic opioid therapy. The oral route should be considered first in patients who can take oral medications unless a rapid onset of analgesia is required or the patient experiences adverse events associated with the oral administration. Continuous parenteral infusion, intravenous or subcutaneous, is recommended for patients who cannot swallow or absorb opioids enterally. Opioids, given parenterally, may produce fast and effective plasma concentrations in comparison with oral or transdermal opioids. Intravenous route is considered for faster analgesia because of the short lag- time between injection and effect in comparison with oral dosing. \u00b7 The methods of administering analgesics that are widely accepted within clinical practice include \"around the clock\", \"as needed\", \"Around the clock\" dosing is provided to chronic pain patients for continuous pain relief. A \"rescue dose\" should also be provided as a subsequent treatment for patients receiving \"around the clock\" doses. Rescue doses of short acting opioids should be provided for pain that is not relieved by regularly scheduled, \"around the clock\" doses. Opioids administered on an \"as needed\" basis are for patients who have intermittent pain with pain- free intervals. The \"as needed\" method is also used when rapid dose titration is required. The patient -controlled analgesia technique allows a patient to control a device that delivers a bolus of analgesic \"on demand\". \u00b7 For opioid- na\u00efve patients experiencing pain intensity 4 or a pain intensity <4 but whose goals of pain control and function are not met, an initial dose of 5 to 15 mg of oral morphine sulfate, 2 to 5 mg of intravenous mor phine sulfate or equivalent is recommended. \u00b7 Patients should be reassessed every 60 minutes for oral medications and every 15 minutes for intravenous medications. If pain remains unchanged or is increased, opioid dose is increased by 50 to 100%. If inadequate response is seen after two to three cycles of the opioid, changing the route of administration from oral to intravenous or subsequent management strategies can be considered. \u00b7 If the pain decreases to 4 to 6, the same dose of opioid is repeated and reassessed again in 60 minutes for oral medications and 15 minutes for intravenous medications. If the pain decreases to 0 to 3, the current effective dose is administered \"as needed\" over the initial 24 hours before proceeding to subsequent management strateg ies. Therapeutic Class Review: opioids (long-acting) Page 90 of 106 Copyright 2015 Review Completed on 05/04/2015 Clinical Guideline Recommendations \u00b7 No single opioid is optimal for all patients. When considering opioid rotation, defined as changing to an equivalent dose of an alternative opioid to avoid adverse events, it is important to consider relative effectiveness when switching between oral and parenteral routes to avoid subsequent overdosing or under -dosing. \u00b7 For opioid- tolerant patients (those chronically receiving opioids on a daily basis) experiencing breakthrough pain of intensity 4, a pain intensity <4 but whose goals of pain control and function are not met, in order to achieve adequate analgesia the previous 24 hour total oral or intravenous opioid requirement must be calculated and the new \"rescue dose\" must be increased by 10 to 20%. \u00b7 Subsequent treatment is based upon the patient's continued pain rating score. All approaches for all pain intensity levels must be administering regular doses of opioids with rescue doses as needed, management of constipation coupled with psychosocial support and education for patients and their famili es. \u00b7 Addition of adjuvant analgesics should be re- evaluated to either enhance the analgesic effect of the opioids or in some cases to counter the adverse events associated with opioids. \u00b7 Although pain intensity ratings will be obtained frequently to evaluate opioid dose increases, a formal re- evaluation to evaluate patient's goals of comfort and function is mandated at each contact. \u00b7 If adequate comfort and function has been achieved, and 24- hour opioid requirement is stable, the patients should be converted to an ER oral medication (if feasible) or another ER formulation (i.e., transdermal fentanyl) or long- acting agent (i.e., methadone). The subsequent treatment is based upon the patients' continued pain rating score. Rescue doses of the short acting formation of the same long acting drug may be provided during maintenance therapy for the management of pain in cancer patients not relieved by ER opioids. \u00b7 Procedure- related pain represents an acute short -lived experience which may be accompanied by a great dea l of anxiety. \u00b7 Interventions to manage procedure- related pain should take into account the type of procedure, the anticipated level of pain, other individual characteristics of the patient such as age, and physical condition. \u00b7 Opioids alone may not provide the optimal therapy, but when used in conjunction with nonopioid analgesics, such as an NSAID or adjuvant, and psychological and physical approaches, they can help to improve patient outcomes. \u00b7 The term adjuvant refers to medication that are coadministered to manage an adverse event of an opioid or to adjuvant analgesics that are added to enhance analgesia. Adjuvant may also include drugs for neuropathic pain. Clinically adjuvant analgesics consist (e.g., topical lidocaine patch. \u00b7 Adjuvant analgesics are commonly used to help manage bone pain, neuropathic pain, visceral pain, and to reduce systemic opioid requirement and are particularly important in treating neuropathic pain that is resistant to opioids. \u00b7 Acetaminophen and NSAIDs are recommended non- opioid analgesics that can be used in the management of adult cancer pain. \u00b7 Non- pharmacological specialty consultations for physical modalities and cognitive modalities may be beneficial adjuncts to pharmacologic Therapeutic Class Review: opioids (long-acting) Page 91 of 106 Copyright 2015 Review Completed on 05/04/2015 Clinical Guideline Recommendations interventions. Attention should also be focused on psychosocial support and providing education to patients and families. American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians: Guidelines for Responsible Opioid Prescribing in Chronic Non - Cancer Pain (2012) 81 \u00b7 Comprehensive assessment and documentation is recommended prior to initiating opioid therapy, including documentation of comprehensive history, general medical condition, psychosocial history, psychiatric status, and substance use history. \u00b7 Screening for opioid use is recommended, despite limited evidence for reliability and accuracy, as it will identify opioid abusers and re duce opioid abuse. \u00b7 Prescription monitoring programs must be implemented, as they provide data on patterns of prescription usage, reduce prescription drug abuse or doctor shopping. \u00b7 Urine drug testing (UDT) must be implemented from initiation along with subs equent adherence monitoring to decrease prescription drug abuse or illicit drug use when patients are in chronic pain management therapy. \u00b7 Establish appropriate physical diagnosis and psychological diagnosis if available prior to initiating opioid therapy. Use caution in ordering various imaging and other evaluations, interpretation and communication with the patient; to avoid increased fear, activity restriction, requests for increased opioids, and maladaptive behaviors. \u00b7 Patients should be stratified as low, medium, or high risk. \u00b7 A pain management consult may assist non- pain physicians, if high- dose opioid therapy is utilized. \u00b7 Establish medical necessity prior to initiation or maintenance of opioid therapy. \u00b7 Establish treatment goals of opioid therapy with regard to pain relief and improvement in function. \u00b7 Long- acting opioids in high doses are recommended only in specific circumstances with severe intractable pain not amenable to short -acting or moderate doses of long- acting opioids, as there is no difference between long-acting and short -acting opioids for their effectiveness or adverse events. \u00b7 An agreement which is followed by all parties is essential in initiating and maintaining opioid therapy as such agreements reduce overuse, misuse, abuse, and diversion. \u00b7 Opioid therapy may be initiated with low doses and short -acting drugs with appropriate monitoring to provide effective relief and avoid adverse events. \u00b7 Up to 40 mg of morphine equivalent is considered as low dose, 41 to 90 mg of morphine equivalent as a moderate dose and greater than 91 mg of morphine equivalence as high dose. \u00b7 In reference to long- acting opioids, titration must be carried out with caution and overdose and misuse must be avoided. \u00b7 Methadone is recommended for use after failure of other opioid therapy and only by clinicians with specific training in the risks and uses. \u00b7 Monitoring recommendation for methadone include electrocardiogram prior to initiation, at 30 days and yearly thereafter. \u00b7 In order to reduce prescription drug abuse and doctor shopping, adherence monitoring by UDT and prescription drug monitoring programs provide evidence that is essential to the identification of those patients who are non- compliant or abusing prescription drugs or illicit drugs. \u00b7 Constipation must be closely monitored and a bowel regimen be initiated as soon as deemed necessary. Therapeutic Class Review: opioids (long-acting) Page 92 of 106 Copyright 2015 Review Completed on 05/04/2015 Clinical Guideline Recommendations \u00b7 Chronic opioid therapy may be continued, with continuous adherence monitoring, in well -selected populations, in conjunction with or after failure of other modalities of treatments wit h improvement in physical and functional status and minimal adverse events. American Pain Society: Clinical Guidelines for the Use of Chronic Opioid Therapy in Chronic Noncancer Pain (2009) 82 \u00b7 Before initiating chronic opioid therapy, clinicians should conduct a history, physical examination and appropriate testing, including an assessment of risk of substance abuse, misuse, or addiction. \u00b7 Clinicians may consider a trial of chronic opioid therapy as an option for chronic non- cancer pain is moderate or severe, pain is having an adverse impact on function or quality of life, and potential therapeutic benefits outweigh or are likely to outweigh potential harms. \u00b7 A benefit -to-harm evaluation including a history, physical examination, and appropriate diagnostic testing, should be performed and documented before and on an ongoing basis during chronic opioid therapy. \u00b7 When starting chronic opioid therapy, informed consent should be obtained. A continuing discussion with the patient regarding chronic opioid therapy should include goals, expectations, potential risks, and alternatives to chronic opioid therapy. \u00b7 Clinicians may consider using a written chronic opioid therapy management plan to document patent and clinician responsibilities and expectations and assist in patient education. \u00b7 Clinicians and patients should regard initial treatment with opioids as a therapeutic trial to determine whether chronic opioid therapy is appropriate. \u00b7 Opioid selection, initial dosing, and titration should be individualized according to the patient's health status, previous exposure to opioids, attainment of therapeutic goals, and predicted or observed harms. There is insufficient evidence to recommend short -acting vs long-a cting opioids, or dosing of opioids. \u00b7 Methadone is characterized by complicated and variable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and should be initiated and titrated cautiously, by clinicians familiar with its use and risks. \u00b7 Clinicians should reassess patients on chronic opioid therapy periodically and as warranted by changing circumstances. Monitoring should include documentation of pain intensity and level of functioning, assessments of progress toward achieving therapeutic goals, presence of adverse events, and adherence to prescribed therapies. \u00b7 In patients on chronic opioid therapy who are at high risk or who have engaged in aberrant drug- related behaviors, clinicians should periodically obtain urine drug screens or other information to confirm adherence to the chronic opioid therapy plan of care. \u00b7 In patients on chronic opioid therapy not at high risk and not known to have engaged in aberrant drug- related behaviors, clinicians should consider periodically obtaining urine drug screens or other information to confirm adherence to the chronic opioid therapy plan of care. \u00b7 Clinicians may consider chronic opioid therapy for patients with chronic non-cancer pain and history of drug abuse, psychiatric issues, or serious aberrant drug- related behaviors only if they are able to implement more frequent and stringent monitoring parameters. In such situations, clinicians should strongly consider consultations with a mental health or addiction specialist. \u00b7 Clinicians should evaluate patients engaging in aberrant drug- related behaviors for appropriateness of chronic opioid therapy or need for restructuring of therapy, referral for assistance in management, or Therapeutic Class Review: opioids (long-acting) Page 93 of 106 Copyright 2015 Review Completed on 05/04/2015 Clinical Guideline Recommendations discontinuation of chronic opioid therapy. \u00b7 When repeated dose escalations occur in patients on chronic opioid therapy, clinicians should evaluate potential causes and reassess benefits relative to harms. \u00b7 In patients who require relatively high doses of chronic opioid therapy, clinicians should evaluate for unique opioid- related adverse events, changes in health status, and adherence to the chronic opioid therapy treatment plan on an ongoing basis, and consider more frequent follow -up visits. \u00b7 Clinicians should consider opioid rotation when patients on chronic opioid therapy experience intolerable adverse events or inadequate benefit despite dose increases. \u00b7 Clinicians should taper or wean patients off of chronic opioid therapy who engage in repeated aberrant drug- related behaviors or drug abuse/diversion, experience no progress toward meeting therapeutic goals, or experience intolerable adverse events. \u00b7 Clinicians should anticipate, identify, and treat common opioid- associated adverse events. \u00b7 As chronic non- cancer pain is often a complex biopsychosocial condition, clinicians who presc ribe chronic opioid therapy should routinely integrate psychotherapeutic interventions, functional restoration, interdisciplinary therapy, and other adjunctive non- opioid therapies. \u00b7 Clinicians should counsel patients on chronic opioid therapy about transient or lasting cognitive impairment that may affect driving and work safety. Patients should be counseled not to drive or engage in potentially dangerous activities when impaired or if they describe or demonstrate signs of impairment. \u00b7 Patients on chronic opioid therapy should identify a clinician who accepts primary responsibility for their overall medical care. This clinician may or may not prescribe chronic opioid therapy, but should coordinate consultation and communication among all clinicians involved in the patient's care. \u00b7 Clinicians should pursue consultation, including interdisciplinary pain management, when patients with chronic non- cancer pain may benefit from additional skills or resources that they cannot provide. \u00b7 In patients on around- the-clock chronic opioid therapy with breakthrough pain, clinicians may consider as needed opioids based upon an initial and ongoing analysis of therapeutic benefit vs risk. \u00b7 Clinicians should counsel women of childbearing potential about the risks and benefits of chronic opioid therapy during pregnancy and after delivery. Clinicians should encourage minimal or no use of chronic opioid therapy during pregnancy, unless potential benefits outweigh risks. If chronic opioid therapy is used during pregnancy, clinicians should be prepared to anticipate and manage risks to the patient and newborn. \u00b7 Clinicians should be aware of current federal and state laws, regulatory guidelines, and policy statements that govern the medical use of chronic opioid therapy for chronic non -cancer pain. \u00b7 A Joint Clinical Practice Guideline from the American College of Physicians and the American \u00b7 Treatment is based on initial workup, evaluation, additional studies (i.e. imaging or blood work) and duration of symptoms. \u00b7 The potential interventions for low back pain are outlined below: Interventions for the Management of Low Back Pain Therapeutic Class Review: opioids (long-acting) Page 94 of 106 Copyright 2015 Review Completed on 05/04/2015 Clinical Guideline Recommendations Pain Society: Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Back Pain (2007) 83 Intervention Type Acute pain (duration <4 weeks) Subacute or chronic pain (duration >4 weeks) Self-care Advice to remain active Yes Yes Application of superficial heat Yes No Book, handouts Yes Yes Pharmacologic Therapy Acetaminophen Yes Yes Tricyclic antidepressants No Yes Benzodiazepines Yes Yes NSAIDs Yes Yes Skeletal muscle relaxants Yes No Tramadol, opioids Yes Yes Non-pharmacologic Therapy Acupuncture No Yes Cognitive behavior therapy No Yes Exercise therapy No Yes Massage No Yes Progressive relaxation No Yes Spinal manipulation Yes Yes Yoga No Yes Intensive interdisciplinary rehabilitation No Yes Adapted with permission from Chou R, et al.

Ann Intern Med. 2007;147(7):482. \u00b7 Physicians should conduct a focused history and physical examination to classify patients into one of three categories: (1) nonspecific pain; (2) pain possibly associated with radiculopathy or spinal stenosis; and ( 3) pain from another specific spinal cause (e.g., neurologic deficits or underlying conditions, ankylosing spondylitis, vertebral compression fracture). Patient history should be assessed for psychosocial risk factors. \u00b7 In combination with information and self -care, the use of medications with proven benefits should be considered. Before beginning treatment, physicians should evaluate the severity of the patient's baseline pain and functional deficits and the potential benefits and risks of treatment, including the relative lack of long- term effectiveness and safety data. In most cases, acetaminophen or NSAIDs are the first -line options. \u00b7 Acetaminophen is considered first -line, even though it is a weaker analgesic compared to NSAIDs, due to more favorable safety profile and low cost. Non- selective NSAIDs are more effective for pain relief but are associated with gastrointestinal and renovascular risks, therefore assessments need to be made before starting a regimen. \u00b7 Skeletal muscle relaxants are associated with central nervous system effects (primarily sedation).These agents should be used with caution. \u00b7 Benzodiazepines seem similar in efficacy as skeletal muscle relaxants for short term pain relief but are associated with risk of abuse and tolerance. \u00b7 Opioid analgesics and tramadol are options for patients with severe, Therapeutic Class Review: opioids (long-acting) Page 95 of 106 Copyright 2015 Review Completed on 05/04/2015 Clinical Guideline Recommendations disabling pain that is not controlled with acetaminophen or NSAIDs. Evidence is insufficient to recommend one opioid over another. \u00b7 Opioid analgesics and tramadol carry a risk for abuse and addiction especially with long term use. These agents should be used with caution.

European Federation of Neurological Societies: Guidelines on the Pharmacological Treatment of Neuropathic Pain (2010) 86 Painful polyneuropathy \u00b7 Diabetic and non- diabetic painful polyneuropathy are similar in symptomatology and with respect to treatment response, with the exception of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -induced neuropathy. \u00b7 Recommended is recommended second line, except for patients with exacerbations of pain or those with predominant coexisting non- neuropathic pain. \u00b7 Strong opioids are recommended third- line treatments due to concerns regarding long- term safety, including addiction potential and misuse. \u00b7 In HIV -associated polyneuropathy, only lamotrigine (in patients receiving antiretroviral treatment), smoking cannabis, and capsaicin patches were found moderately useful. PHN \u00b7 Recommended first -line treatments include a tricyclic antidepressant, gabapentin, or pregabalin. \u00b7 Topical lidocaine with its excellent tolerability may be considered first -line in the elderly, especially if there are concerns of adverse events of oral medications. \u00b7 Strong opioids and capsaicin cream are recommended as second- line therapies. Trigeminal neuralgia \u00b7 Recommended first -line treatments include carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine. \u00b7 Oxcarbazepin e may be preferred because of decreased potential for drug interactions. Patients with intolerable adverse events may be prescribed lamotrigine but should also be considered for a surgical intervention. Central pain \u00b7 Recommended first -line treatments include amitriptyline, gabapentin or pregabalin. \u00b7 Tramadol may be considered second- line. \u00b7 Strong opioids are recommended as second- or third -line if chronic treatment is not an issue. \u00b7 Lamotrigine may be considered in central post -stroke pain or spinal cord injury pain with incomplete cord lesion and brush- induced allodynia and cannabinoids in multiple sclerosis only if all other treatments fail.

Antidepressants \u00b7 Amitriptyline, venlafaxine, and duloxetine should be considered for the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy. Data are insufficient to recommend one of these agents over another. \u00b7 Venlafaxine may be added to gabapentin for a better response. \u00b7 There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of des ipramine, imipramine, fluoxetine, or the combination of nortriptyline and fluphenazine in the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy. Opioids \u00b7 Dextromethorphan, morphine sulfate, tramadol, and oxycodone should be considered for treatment. Data are insufficient to recommend one agent over the other. Other pharmacologic options \u00b7 Capsaicin and isosorbide dinitrate spray should be considered for treatment. \u00b7 Clonidine, pentoxifylline, and mexiletine should probably not be considered for treatment. \u00b7 Lidocaine patch may be considered for treatment. \u00b7 There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the usefulness of vitamins and -lipoic acid for treatment. Nonpharmacologic options \u00b7 Percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation should be considered for treatment. \u00b7 Electromagnetic field treatment, low -intensity laser treatment, and Reiki therapy should probably not be considered for treatment. \u00b7 Evidence is insufficient to support or refute the use of amitriptyline plus electrotherapy for treatment. American Associat ion of Clinical Endocrinologists: Medical Guidelines for Clinical Practice for the Management of Diabetes Mellitus (2007) 88 Neuropathy \u00b7 All patients with type 2 diabetes should be assessed for neuropathy at the time of diagnosis, and all patients with type 1 diabetes should be assessed five years after diagnosis. Annual examinations should be performed thereafter in all patients. \u00b7 Inspect the patient's feet at every visit to evaluate skin, nails, pulses, temperature, evidence of pressure, and hygiene. \u00b7 Perform an annual comprehensive foot examination to assess sensory function by pinprick, temperature and vibration sensation using a tuning fork, or pressure using a monofilament. \u00b7 Refer patient to a qualified podiatrist, orthopedist, or neurologist if there is lack of sensation or mechanical foot changes. \u00b7 Consider treatment with duloxetine or pregabalin, both of which are indicated to treat diabetic neuropathy. Therapeutic Class Review: opioids (long-acting) Page 100 of 106 Copyright 2015 Review Completed on 05/04/2015 Clinical Guideline Recommendations \u00b7 When treating patients with cardiac autonomic neuropathy, strategies appropriate for protection against cardiovascular disease should be utilized. \u00b7 Tricyclic antidepressants; topical capsaicin; and pregabalin, topiramate, and lamotrigine may provide symptomatic relief, but must be prescribed with knowledge of potential toxicities. \u00b7 Further study is required before botanical preparations and dietary supplements can be advocated to treat neuropathic symptoms. \u00b7 Maintain a referral network for podiatric and peripheral vascular studies and care. American Diabetes Association: Diabetic Neuropathies (2005)89 Algorithm for the management of symptoms diabetic polyneuropathy \u00b7 Exclude nondiabetic etiologies, followed by, stabilize glycemic control (insulin not always required in type 2 diabetes), followed by, tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline 25 to 250 mg before bed), followed by, anticonvulsants (e.g., gabapentin, typical dose 1.8 g/day), followed by, opioid or opioid- like drugs (e.g., tramadol, oxycodone), followed by, consider pain clinical referral. American Academy of Neurology: Practice Parameter: Treatment of lidocaine patches are effective and should be used in the treatment of PHN. \u00b7 There is limited evidence to support nortriptyline over amitriptyline, and the data are insufficient to recommend one opioid over another. \u00b7 Amitriptyline has significant cardiac effects in the elderly when compared to nortriptyline and desipramine. \u00b7 Aspirin cream is possibly effective in the relief of pain in patients with PHN, but the magnitude of benefit is low, as seen with capsaicin. \u00b7 In countries with preservative- free intrathecal methylprednisolone available, it may be considered in the treatment of PHN. \u00b7 Acupuncture, E, and zimelidine are not of benefit. The effectiveness of zone lesions, and stellate ganglion block are unproven in the treatment o f PHN. \u00b7 There is insufficient evidence to make any recommendations on the long- term effects of these treatments. European League Against Rheumatism: Evidence- Based Recommendations for the Management of Fibromyalgia Syndrome (2008) 91 \u00b7 Tramadol is recommended for the management of pain in fibromyalgia. \u00b7 Simple analgesics such as paracetamol and other weak opioids can also be considered in the treatment of fibromyalgia. \u00b7 Corticosteroids and strong opioids are not recommended. \u00b7 Amitriptyline, fluoxetine, duloxetine, milnacipran, moclobemide and pirlindole (not available in the United States), reduce pain and often improve function, therefore they are recommended for the treatment of fibromyalgia. \u00b7 Tropisetron, pramipexole and pregabalin reduce pain and are recommended for the treatment of fibromyalgia. Conclusions Therapeutic Class Review: opioids (long-acting) Page 101 of 106 Copyright 2015 Review Completed on 05/04/2015 Opioids have been the mainstay of pain treatment for a number of years and there is well documented evidence of their effectiveness. Oral morphine sulfate is the standard for comparison for all other opioid agents currently available. Starting in March 2014, all long -acting opioid labels were updated with an indication change. Long- acting opioids are now indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around- the-clock, long- term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. 19 Methadone is the only long- acting opioid to also be FDA -approved for the treatment of opioid addiction (maintenance or detoxification treatment).6-10 The current formulations deter abuse; however, there is no well -documented clinical evidence to demonstrate these formulations prevent abuse.4,14,15,17 All of the long- acting opioids are classified as Schedule II controlled substances by the FDA, with the exception of buprenorphine transdermal systems which is a Schedule III controlled substance. 1-18 On July 9, 2012, the FDA approved a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy for all long- acting op ioids which includes the availability of training regarding proper prescribing practices by manufacturers, as well as the distribution of educational materials on the safe use of these agents. 23 In general, all of the long- acting opioids are similar in terms of associated effectiveness, adverse events, warnings, and contraindications. 1-18 Head- to-head trials demonstrate similar efficacy among the agents in the class, and current clinical guidelines do not state a preference for the use of one long- acting opioid over another for the use in moderate to severe pain.80-91 Main differences among the individual agents and formulations are due to dosing requirements and generic availability. Several generic long- acting opioids exist, including fentanyl transderm al systems; hydromorphone ER tablets; ER tablets, oral solution, and oral concentrate solution; morphine sulfate ER tablets and capsules; oxycodone ER analgesics, full opioid agonists g enerally have no ceiling for their analgesic effectiveness, except that imposed by adverse events.21 Even though no true ceiling dose exists, dosing intervals are important with these agents; mainly due to their associated adverse events and risks. 22 Besides the two transdermal agents, almost all long- acting opioids are dosed twice daily. Buprenorphine patches are applied once every seven days, while fentanyl transdermal systems are applied every 72 hours.1,2 Exalgo\u00ae , (morphine) capsules and Embeda\u00ae (morphine/naltrexone) capsules can to be administered once or twice daily.12,17 MS Contin\u00ae (morphine) tablets or all methadone formulations are dosed twice or three times daily.6-10,13 The remaining long- acting agents are dosed twice acting opioids with a maximum daily dose. Avinza\u00ae (morphine) has a max dose of 1,600 mg/day due to the capsules being formulated with fumaric acid, which at that dose has not been shown to be safe and effective and may cause renal toxicity 11. Xartemis XR\u00ae (oxycodone/acetaminophen) is limited to four tablets per day, and/or if taking other acetaminophen products, a maximum of 4,000 mg/day.18 Most solid, long- acting opioid formulations (tablets, capsules) should be swallowed whole and should not be broken, chewed, cut, crushed, or dissolved before swallowing.1-18 The only exceptions are the morphine- containing capsules (Avinza\u00ae, Kadian\u00ae, Embeda\u00ae), which can all be opened and the pellets sprinkled on applesauce and then swallowed whole.11,12,17 Kadian\u00ae pellets can also be placed in 10 mL of water and used through a 16 French gastrostomy tube.12 Neither Avinza\u00ae, Kadian\u00ae, nor Embeda\u00ae pellets may be used thorough a nasogastric tube.11,12,17 It is recommended to only swallow one Zohydro or time.3,4,14-16 Therapeutic Class Review: opioids (long-acting) Page 102 of 106 Copyright 2015 Review on 05/04/2015 References: 1.
