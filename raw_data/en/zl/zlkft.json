Pain may be localized, and may eventually spread, further affecting the quality of life of patients. The pathophysiology is not clearly identified and neither is the diagnostic criteria, which has further lead to lack of research on the topic. We hereby present a narrative review; discussing the symptomatology, differential diagnosis and the diagnostic criteria available for the condition, as also the holistic management.DOI: 10.31080/ASDS.2022.06.1383 International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD, ver - sion 3) published by the International Headache Society (IHS) de - fines persistent idiopathic facial pain (PIFP) as 'persistent facial and/or oral pain, with varying presentations but recurring daily for more than 2 hours per day over more than 3 months, in the absence of clinical neurological deficit' [1]. In a study published in 2020, PIFP was found to be frequently misdiagnosed, imposing the unnecessary burden of ineffective medications, unwarranted procedures, and economic burden [2,11] . This is mainly because its clinical presentation is variable, often confused with other oro - facial pains; its diagnostic criteria is loose and ambiguous, and the pathological mechanism is not clear [3-7] . This necessitates a discussion on understanding the disease etiopathogenesis, diag - nostic guideline and treatment planning. Limited epidemiological data is available, as PIFP is a rare disease. According to a study, the incidence of PIFP is 4.4 (95% confidence interval : [3.2; 5.9])/ 100 000 person-years [8]. Another population-based study from Essen, Germany, found a lifetime prevalence of 0.03% [9]. Overall, women are significantly more frequently affected than men and account for about 75% to 90% of cases [8,10] , with most cases are between 30 and 60 years of age at the time of first diagnosis [10] . Understanding orofacial pain International Classification of Orofacial Pain (first edition) The International Classification of Orofacial Pain (ICOP) has categorized orofacial pain into six groups [3]. The first three main groups represent disorders of the masticatory system in its broad - est sense generally treated by dentists. The fourth to sixth groups comprise orofacial pain syndromes where the pain is not explained is not morphological correlated with the teeth, dentoalveolar struc - tures or temporomandibular joint. It is non-dental orofacial pain and should be treated with conservative pain therapy.

All the above-mentioned diseases and conditions vary in their pathophysiology and therefore in symptomatology, discussion of which is beyond the scope of this article. PIFP PIFP has been found to be associated with minor surgical or other invasive dental or otolaryngological procedure, which may have been performed in an attempt to manage the pain. However, the sequence of events is unsure and often not reliable [18] . Earlier known as atypical facial pain, PIFP is a rare and poorly understood orofacial pain condition. The presentation of this con - dition is rare characterized by continuous pain of the face and/or teeth, sometimes varying in intensity throughout the day, it is usu - ally medium, sometimes strong. Usually deep but can be superficial as well. Poorly localized, radiating pain, described as aching, burn - ing, throbbing and often stabbing pain. Mild to severe in intensity, rated 7-11 on VAS scale, only few patients report that their pain ceases for longer period of time, sleep is usually undisturbed by pain, and some may even report brief pain free periods on wak - ing up in the morning before pain occurs, usually lasting for 30 minutes or lesser. Only one side may be affected, rarely it affects bilaterally (in 40% cases) in the later course of disease. Spread is non-dermatomal, Maximum intensity of pain is experienced in the cheeks and upper jaw, pain may radiate to lower jaw, occiput, ear, shoulder or arm, but this maybe unusual [17]. No objectively iden - tifiable neurological deficits may be seen. Rarely, swelling may be experienced on nasolabial region on affected side of face [11] . Concomitant autonomic symptoms may not be noted. Charac - teristics of neuropathic facial pain are usually absent; however 10% patients may show neuropathic pain [13] patient does not show sensory negative symptoms such as anesthesia or hypoes - thesia [11] , some has been reported using QST [14-17] . It has been suggested by IHS that patients with neuro - pathic pain following a surgery or trauma and with neurosensory changes should be diagnosed as painful traumatic trigeminal neu - ropathy (PTTN), this should be taken into account when managing patients and conducting studies [1]. Atypical odontalgia, now known as persistent idiopathic (PIDAP), is a subtype of PIFP , symptoms of which are identical as described above, difference being that PIDAP remains strictly limited to one or two teeth and does not spread [12] . Psychiatric and psychosocial disability have often been asso - ciated with PIFP [19] , however this has not been proven yet and studies have also found no psychiatric disorders compared to control, [20] . Studies have shown higher Anxiety and depression scores in PIFP patients with higher pain intensity [21] . 41.3% pa - tients suffering from PIFP or Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) have been found to have axis I disorder (major depression being the commonest) before the onset of orofacial pain [19] . This therefore necessitates interdisciplinary approach in diagnosis and manage - ment of PIFP . Pathogenesis The pathophysiology of PIFP is not clear, studies have shown increased neuronal activity at brainstem level, [20,22,23] of pre-frontal cortex [24] , alteration on dopamine system associated transmission and modula - tion [25] , QST results - pathic pain [14-16] . No evidence has been compression of trigeminal root entry [26-28] . PIFP a heterogenous with definitive neuro - pathic pain syndrome or idiopathic pain with unclear neuropathic involvement.

Acta Scientific Dental Sciences 6.6 (2022): 70-77.sory pathway, the QST profiles were not significantly different for controls in these patients [20] . Diagnosis Diagnosis is based on diagnosis of exclusion, recently in a paper published by Benoliel R., et al. PIFP was classified into 6 different types, ranging from A to F [7]. Diagnostic criteria Notes A Facial and/or oral pain fulfilling criteria B and CThis is the current term for what was previously termed Atypical Fa - cial pain or its intraoral counterpart, atypical odontalgia B Recurring daily for >2 hours per day for > 3 monthsIt can have sharp exacerbations and is aggravated by stress. CPain has both the follow - ing characteristics: 1. Poorly localized, and not following the distribution of a peripheral nerve 2. Dull aching or nagging qualityPain may be described as either deep or superficial. With time it may spread to a wider area of craniocer - vical region D Clinical neurological examination is normalA continuum seems to exist from PIFP induced by insignificant trauma to painful post -traumatic trigeminal neuropathy caused by significant insult to the peripheral nerves. PIFP may be initiated by a minor operation or injury to face, maxil - lae and teeth or gums without any demonstrable local cause. However, psychophysical or neurophysiologi - cal tests may demonstrate sensory abnormalities EA dental cause has been excluded by appropriate investigationsThe term atypical odontalgia has been applied to a continuous pain in one or more teeth or in a tooth socket after extraction, in absence of any usual dental cause. This is thought to be a sub form of PIFP , al - though it is more localised, the mean age at onset is younger and genders are more balanced. F Not better accounted for by another ICHD-3 diagnosisPersistent Idiopathic facial pain (PIFP) may be comorbid with other pain conditions such as chronic widespread pain and irritable bowel syndrome. In addition, it presents with high levels of psychiatric comorbidity and psychosocial dis - ability. Table 1According to ICHD-3 criteria for the diagnosis of persistent idio - pathic facial pain (ICHD, Cephalalgia 2013, 33,782) [1]. Facial and/or oral pain fulling criteria B and C Recurring daily for > 2 h per day for > 3 months Pain has both of the following characteristics o poorly localized, and not following the distribution of a pe - ripheral nerve o dull, aching or nagging quality Clinical neurological examination is normal A dental cause has been excluded by appropriate investiga - tions. Not better accounted for by another ICHD-3 diagnosis. It is important to distinguish PIFP from other chronic daily headache syndromes, including the following Trigeminal neuralgia Postherpetic neuralgia (short-lasting, u nilateral, n euralgiform headache at - tacks with conjunctival injection and t earing) syndrome Jabs and jolts syndrome Raeder syndrome Thalamic pain burning mouth syndrome, giant cell arte - ritis can be distinguished from TN and PIFP by presence or absence of autonomic phenomenon, neurologic deficits. Evaluation of nerve root for trauma, inflammation and tumour must be considered for diagnosis of trigeminal nerve disorders, and to distinguish it from Painful traumatic trigeminal neuropathy (PTTN), PTTN is a con - dition in which pain occurs in a region of trigeminal nerve, there is definite injury to the nerve, not older than six months. Pain is generally localized. Besides, evaluation of musculoskeletal and odontoid structures for evaluation of orofacial disorders causing facial pain is important to rule out myofascial pain dysfunction syn - drome (MPDS). Psychosocial disorders are often a comorbidity as - sociated with PIFP or other orofacial pain and must be thoroughly investigated for diagnosis and treatment planning.72A Review on Persistent Idiopathic Persistent Idiopathic Facial Pain (PIFP)\". Acta Scientific Dental Sciences 6.6 (2022): 70-77.PIFP can often be confused with myofascial pain, especially in the pericranial area, and must be distinguished by the referring pattern ; pain reffered to eye, jaw,, teeth is not common in case of PIFP . Migraine headache, cluster headache, as well as the trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias, can also have facial pain complaints, simi - lar to PIFP but the timing and the associated tearing or conjunctival injection, help to distinguish [7,29 ]. Treatment The mainstay of medical treatment of PIFP is counseling [45] Patients should be counseled about the chronic nature of the ill - ness, and its nonmalignant nature. Their pain should be acknowl - edged, and they should feel that their concerns are being heard, their attitudes and beliefs on pain must be considered and a plan for addressing them is forthcoming [30] . Investigation should always be supplemented with - screen - ing questionnaire for anxiety and/or depression (such as hospital anxiety and depression scale), Brief pain inventory - facial [46] Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [47] , Pain Catastrophizing scale [48] , Chronic graded pain scale [49] , as they help to identify the psychological impact of the disease. Only 32% (6/19) centers managing chronic facial pain did psychological testing according to a study conducted by German university [50] . In 1982, Dr Eric Cassel wrote the article \"The nature of suffering and the goals of medicine,\" he writes, \"....Physicians' failure to un - derstand the nature of suffering can result in medical intervention that (though technically adequate) not only fails to relieve suffer - ing but becomes a source of suffering itself.\" [51] Chronic pain is manifest not just physiologically, but shaped by one's experiences, culture, social norms, and expectations, emotions, such as anger, fear, and anxiety, strongly influence pain perception. Being positive, relaxed, and distracted can reduce pain sensitivity [45] . In a systematic review, that considered 17 trials in orofacial pain, all studies were shown to have a high risk, thus backing weak evidence in support of their use [42] . In one patient blinded con - trolled trial, 41 PIFP patients were compared active hypnosis for 5 hour individual sessions in one group with relaxation in another group. The study found significant pain relief in susceptible indi - viduals, but there was need for further support to evidence with respect to psychological support, coping strategies and psychologi - cal issues [40] .Patient must be trained to move away from identifying cause, and directed towards coping strategies, targeting goals that will improve the quality of life. These sessions may be short, reassur - ance with an explanation, supplemented with written patient in - formation may be helpful. Context can be found on European Fed - eration Chapters wwwhttp://www.efic.org/index. European Year against pain 2013/14. [43,44] . Considering the ambiguous nature of the disease, there are not enough RCT and therefore multidisciplinary approach with mini - mal or no intervention has been suggested [31] . Behavioral inter - ventions, along with pharmacotherapy - antidepressants and anti - epileptic drugs. Proper patient education to clarify the diagnosis, patient must be discouraging from any invasive treatment. Theraputic trials considered for PIFP (and AFP) have been laser therapy [36] , all of which have been shown to have beneficial effects, however level of evidence is low. High-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on the right secondary somatosensory (S2) cortex in patients with neuropathic orofacial pain induced signifi - cant pain relief compared to stimulation of the sensorimotor (S1/ M1) cortex and sham stimulation [37] . Occipital nerve blocks have been proven to be inefficient [39] whereas, hypnosis has been shown to have a positive effect [40] . When all treatment fails, pulsed radiofrequency for sphenopalatine ganglion has been shown to be effective [41] ; however, invasive treatments always come with a risk for traumatic neuropathy and always end up increasing pain. Considering the poor prognosis of PIFP with respect to treat - ment outcomes, patients afflicted with this condition have become fertile ground for studies involving \"integrative medicine,\" which refers to the combination of complementary and alternative ther - apy, including nutrition, mind-body therapies, and spirituality. The emphasis is on the whole person and a \"holistic\" approach, in com - bination with evidence-based medicine. Diet Integrative approach to patients health is incomplete without consideration for patients diet for Hippocrates quotes, \"Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food.\" Inflammation is a poten - tial mediator in chronic pain states, caused due to injury to muscle 73A Review on Persistent Idiopathic Persistent Idiopathic Facial Pain (PIFP)\". Acta Scientific Dental Sciences 6.6 (2022): 70-77.or deep tissue causing changes in both central and peripheral path - ways, further leading to neuronal hyperresponsiveness, abnormal spontaneous discharge and increase in the receptive field [52] . Promoting a diet low in saturated fat, rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains is recommended by the US Preventive Services Task Force for health promotion as also as part of 2005 Dietary guidelines for Americans. (53) Dietary supplementation with ome - ga-3 fatty acid, considering the anti-inflammatory effect of n-3 fatty acids tends to suppress T-cell function, Vitamin E helps to mitigate this effect. Multi-vitamins inclusive of B vitamins, especially B6, B12, folate, thiamine, Zinc and Vitamin A (immune function), Vita - min C. (neuroprotector) [54] . Exercise In 2003, a review found the evidence to support the role of ther - apeutic exercise on chronic pain, different physical exercises yield same magnitude of effect on pain, and therefore any activity can be selected as per patients preference, desired outcome and experi - ence [55] . Osteopathic manipulative therapy and accupuncture OMT is a way to promote healing by manipulating bones to al - low free circulation of blood and balanced functioning of nerves, OMT has been found effective in treatment of migraine [56] . Acu - puncture involves use of small needles places superficially into any more than 360 points on body along the 12 meridians, that are pos - tulated to channel qi, or vital energy/life force. Disease is said to occurs due to blockage of qi in this paradigm. Acupuncture works by restoring these natural energetic flows. The use of Acupuncture and OMT has not been explored in treatment of PIFP however, there is strong evidence of the benefits of such treatment in chronic pain therapy [57-59] . Cognitive behavioral therapy Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), emphasizes on effective coping strategies and acceptance of pain, is also recommended as adjunctive therapy for PIFP [61] An evidence-based review of 4 CBT trials in TMD revealed 1 trial showing no effect, and 3 that showed both short-term and long-term improvement in outcomes [60] . Religion and spirituality The role of religion and spirituality proves to have a significant source of support for many patients with chronic pain [62]. Pa- tients' reliance on spirituality in chronic illness and pain has re -vealed positive outcomes with improved sense of well-being, resil - iency, and decreased pain and anxiety. Prayer is proven to be one of the most commonly used complementary modalities, and religious coping a common strategy for dealing with pain [63] . The mind is a very powerful tool in pain management, whether focused, relaxed, or distracted. Therefore, methods to engage it, from meditation to biofeedback [64] through journaling [65] and art [66] music therapy [67] are additional tools that may play a useful role in crafting an individualized plan for pain management in patients with chronic facial pain. These less studied and often underemphasized aspects, includ - ing nutrition, mind-body therapies, and spirituality essentially em - phasize on the whole person and a \"holistic\" approach, in combina - tion with evidence-based medicine. Conclusion Persistent idiopathic facial pain represents a challenging diag - nostic and treatment entity. The best approach uses a multidisci - plinary team, typically is a combining agents and modalities that address not just the physical body, but also include the psychoso - cial, emotional, behavioral, and spiritual components as they relate to the whole person, aiming to not only cure but heal thy patients restoring their humanity and integrity. In this manner, patients may not be cured, but healed in a way that restores part of their humanity and integrity. Bibliography 1.
