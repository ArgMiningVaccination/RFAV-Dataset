This award recognizes hospitals that meet specic metrics for delivering evidence-based stroke care to patients in a timely fashion. The second recognition is our inclusion in Becker's Hospital Review's 2015 edition of 100 Great Hospitals in America. This prestigious list highlights the very best hospitals in the country.Christ Medical Center couldn't be prouder of its physicians, nurses, administrators and staff.Both of these recognitions highlight our commitment to excellence in health care. As a community hospital, we know that our patients are our neighbors. We want to provide our neighbors with the best care possible throughout their lifespans. This is also why Christ Medical Center offers a variety of health education programs that help our neighbors not only to maintain good health but to understand and manage health challenges as they arise. As we continue through this summer season, I wish the best for you and your faith community.

Wendell OmanVice President, Ofce for Mission & Spiritual Care Connections - Advocate Christ Medical Center Ofce for Mission and Spiritual Care Summer 2015 - Page 2 Advocate Christ Medical Center, which has one of the largest stroke programs in the state of Illinois and is designated a Comprehensive Stroke Center by DNV Healthcare, again has been recognized for excellence in the treatment of stroke patients by the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA).The Association has selected the medical center and its Neurosciences Institute for a Stroke Gold Plus Quality Achievement Award in recognition of the institution's ongoing commitment to evidence-based stroke-care guidelines under the AHA/ASA Get With the Guidelines\u00ae program, said Melvin Wichter MD, co-director of the Neurosciences Institute and chair of the medical center's neurology department. Get With the Guidelines provides the most up-to-date, research-based care standards to speed recovery and reduce death and disability among stroke patients.\"With a stroke, time lost is brain lost. The Get With the Guidelines-Stroke Gold Plus Quality Achievement Award demonstrates Christ Medical Center's commitment to being one of the leading hospitals in the country for providing aggressive, proven stroke care,\" said Franco Campanella DO, medical director of the Christ Medical Center's stroke program. \"We intend to continue our focus on providing care that has been shown in the scientic literature to treat patients quickly and efciently with evidence-based protocols.\"Advocate Christ Medical Center has also met specic scientic guidelines as a Comprehensive Stroke Center - the highest level stroke center certication awarded - featuring a comprehensive system for rapid diagnosis and treatment of stroke patients admitted to the emergency department.\"We are pleased to recognize Advocate Christ Medical Center for its commitment and dedication to stroke care,\" said Deepak L. Bhatt, MD, MPH, national chair of the Get With the Guidelines steering committee, executive director of interventional cardiovascular programs at Brigham and Women's Hospital and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. \"Studies have shown that hospitals consistently following Get With the Guidelines quality improvement measures can reduce patients' length of stays and 30-day readmission rates and reduce disparity gaps in care.\"According to the AHA/ASA, stroke is the fth leading cause of death and a major contributor to adult disability in the United States. On average, someone suffers a stroke every 40 seconds, and someone dies of a stroke every four minutes. Some 795,000 Americans experience a new or recurrent stroke every year.\"The number of acute ischemic stroke patients who are eligible for treatment is expected to grow during the next decade due to increasing stroke incidence and a large aging population,\" Dr. Campanella said. Advocate Christ Medical Centergets a Gold Plus in stroke care In addition to the Gold Plus Award, the medical center has made the AHA/ASA's Target: StrokeSM Honor Roll for following stroke quality measures that reduce the time between a patient's arrival at the hospital and the onset of treatment using the clot-buster, tPA, the only drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat ischemic stroke. People who suffer a stroke and receive tPA within three hours of the start of symptoms may recover more quickly and be less likely to suffer severe disabilities.To earn the award, the Christ Medical Center stroke team had to meet specic, quality achievement measures for the diagnosis and treatment of stroke patients at a set level for a designated period of time. These measures include aggressive use of medications, such as tPA, antithrombotics, anticoagulation therapy, DVT prophylaxis and cholesterol-reducing drugs, as well as smoking-cessation education - all aimed at reducing death and disability and improving the lives of stroke patients.Connections - Advocate Christ Medical Center Ofce for Mission and Spiritual Care Summer 2015 - Page 3 Advocate Christ Medical Center4440 West 95th Street, Oak Lawn, IL 60453 708.684.8000 Staff Chaplains:Refat Abukhdeir, Moslem MinistriesCarla Banks, United Church of ChristMary Anne Cannon, Roman CatholicDenise Duncan, United Church of ChristFr.

As we journey together with families, there are countless ways in which we can nurture their faith and well-being so that they can live with hope and vitality, even in the face of illness and health challenges. Just as you nurture the faith and spiritual life of children and families at worship, I also invite you to join us here at the hospital in supporting the physical and emotional needs of children and families. In this newsletter, we share an exciting partnership between Advocate Children's Hospital and the Chicago Zoological Society to create opportunities for children with autism and their families.

In support of our pediatric patients (ages 3-8) on the autism spectrum, Advocate Children's Hospital and the Chicago Zoological Society recently partnered to offer FAMILY FUN SATURDAYS at Brookeld Zoo. FAMILY FUN SATURDAYS provided an interactive and fun environment for skill building. The ACH Developmental Pediatrics teams, along with Brookeld Zoo staff, developed a curriculum focused on inclusion, animals and experiential learning. \"Families of children with autism may avoid community activities because they fear how others may react to their child or how their child may react to situations,\" said Dr. James Weedon, Developmental Pediatrician. \"This partnership is great because it offers a typical childhood experience in a nurturing environment that focuses on developing social and motor skills.\"The hour-long program met in the award-winning Hamill Family Play Zoo, which was built to foster early childhood connections with nature and wildlife. Activities varied with each session but included meeting animals, crafts, working in the garden, scavenger hunts and a shift in the pretend zoo animal hospital. The ACH team developed goals for program participants to help guide them through each session. \"This program is a helpful, real-life expansion of our patients' treatment goals,\" said Valeria Nanclares-Nogues, Psy.D., coordinator, Autism Program at the Developmental Pediatric Center. \"It gives us another way to support our patients with autism and their families.\"In the spirit of inclusion, high school age students with autism from our Transitions Program volunteered to help facilitate activities. Participants were honored with a graduation ceremony at the end of the program.Advocate Children's Hospital - Oak Lawn4440 West 95th St., Oak Lawn, IL 60453Advocate Children's Hospital - Park Ridge1675 Dempster St., Park Ridge, IL 600681.855.312.KIDSStaff Chaplains:Carol Stephens BCC, United Church of ChristEliza Stoddard Leatherberry BCC, United Church of ChristTracy Nolan, United Church of ChristAdministrative StaffStacey Jutila, BCC Church Children's Hospital's partners with Brookeld Zoo\"Families of children with autism may avoid community activities because they fear how others may react to their child or how their child may react to situations.\" Studies show that animal interactions may ease social anxiety in kids with autism.

In addition, non-family members also commit abuse. Faith communities play an important role in preventing, identifying and reporting child abuse. Here are some ways that congregations can protect children:Developing educational programsFaith communities can work with child advocates to educate their congregations about neglect and abuse. Education can take the form of in-person programs offered at the church as well as training for clergy and religious educators.Identifying and reporting child abuseWhile Illinois clergy are legally required to report suspected child abuse, all congregants, particularly those who work with children, should be trained to identify and report abuse.Developing safe congregation policiesCongregations can help prevent abuse by creating policies that protect children. These policies may include:Requiring regular background checks for clergy, educators and staff members.Establishing guidelines for adult staff or volunteer members who work with children or youth, such as requiring the presence of at least two unrelated adult supervisors at youth or children's activities.Requiring staff and volunteers to undergo regular training on safe congregation issues and policies.Providing support to families In some cases, abuse and neglect can be prevented by providing adequate support to families under stress. Ways of providing support to families include:Connecting families with social service and mental health resources.Providing practical support by helping with transportation, child care, utility bills and other basic needs.Taking time to listen to parents who are struggling. How to recognize child abuseIn 1983, President Ronald Reagan declared April to be National Child Abuse Prevention Month. Since then, government and social service professionals have worked tirelessly to raise awareness of child abuse and what people can do to prevent it.Children who are being abused often have difficulty asking for help. They may not want to get their abuser in trouble, especially if the abuser is a parent or relative. The child may fear that the abuser will hurt him/her or a family member if the child reports the abuse. Very young children and children with disabilities may have difficulty communicating their abuse to others.Because it can be so difficult for children to disclose abuse, adults must be vigilant about identifying signs of abuse and neglect, which may include:Sudden changes in personality or behavior, such as becoming withdrawn or moody.Frequent injuries.Attempts to cover up injuries by wearing weather-inappropriate clothing, such as a long-sleeved shirt on a hot day.Fear of going home.Untreated illnesses or injuries.Age-inappropriate behavior. For example, an older sibling in an abusive or neglectful home may \"parent\" his or her younger siblings.Poor grooming and personal hygiene.If you believe that a child might be the victim of abuse or neglect, it's important to speak up for that child. In Illinois, you can contact the Department of Children and Family Services child abuse hotline 24 hours a day, seven days a week at 800-25-ABUSE. If you believe that a child is in immediate danger, call 911.April Is Child Abuse Prevention Month5-15Resources: Advocatehealth.com Centers for Ocular Melanoma Foundation: God, we thank you for the gift of nature's renewal. Remind us through the day to watch for our own safety and that of others. Amen.Faith communities: Help prevent skin cancerSpring and summer is an exciting time for many faith communities. School will soon be out, and congregations and their children's and youth groups look forward to picnics, outdoor rummage sales, camps and field trips.It's also a time when community members may be exposed to unhealthy levels of UV radiation, increasing their risk of skin cancer. Here are some things that faith communities can do to raise awareness of and address these risks:Encourage outdoor event attendees to both wear sunscreen and bring a bottle with them so they can reapply it during the day. This is particularly important if the day's activities include sports and/or swimming. Perspiration and exposure to water can wash away sunscreen. Parents should be encouraged to apply sunscreen to their children before an activity and pack sunscreen with their child's lunch so that it can be reapplied throughout the day.Ask your parish nurse or another member of the congregation who is a healthcare professional to spearhead a skin cancer awareness program. Make congregants aware of the importance of protecting their skin against UV rays and talking to their doctor about their own risk of skin cancer.Talk to young people in the congregation about the risks of tanning and tanning beds. Influential members of your congregation's youth group can exert positive peer pressure and encourage healthy choices and behaviors.Provide support to individuals who have been diagnosed with skin cancer or who are concerned that a spot or a changing mole may be cancerous. Don't minimize a skin cancer diagnosis and be supportive when an individual expresses fear about the possibility of melanoma. If appropriate, offer to accompany the individual to a doctor's appointment to have a spot or mole checked out.Detect and prevent skin cancerWhile this is a great time of year to get outside, it's important to be mindful of ultraviolet (UV) radiation risks. UV radiation exposure is linked to skin damage, including the development of skin cancer.Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the United States. The most deadly form is melanoma, killing over 9000 people annually. UV radiation can also contribute to ocular melanoma, a type of eye cancer.Basal and squamous cell carcinomas are far less deadly but still serious. Basal cell skin cancer can result in disfigurement, and roughly two percent of squamous cell cancer patients died of the disease in 2012.Prevention and detection: Everyone is at risk for skin cancer. Fortunately, there are a number of steps people can take to prevent skin cancer and ensure early diagnosis.Take precautions against overexposure to the sun. Use a high SPF sunscreen when going out, and reapply during the day. The sun is at its peak between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., but UV exposure can happen at any time the sun is out and even on cloudy days.Avoid tanning beds. In addition to increasing one's risk of skin cancer, exposure to UV radiation can accelerate skin aging. Make sure that both prescription eyewear and sunglasses have a UV coating to protect the eyes. Many eyeglass manufacturers include this coating at no additional cost, but it's important to verify that glasses or prescription lenses offer UV protection.Ask about skin cancer screenings during medical checkups. A doctor can assess your risk of developing skin cancer and may refer you to a dermatologist for specialized observation and care.Know the signs of possible skin cancer. A new spot or mark on the skin should be brought to the attention of a medical professional at once. Keep an eye on moles. If a mole starts to bleed or change shape, seek medical attention immediately.Don't forget the sunscreen this summer!6-15Resources: Health Month: menshealthmonth.orgDear God, I'm thankful for the men in my life. Care for them and guide them as they go through their days and give them the wisdom needed to care for themselves. Amen.How faith communitiescan promote men's healthMany men are deeply involved with their faith communities. This means that congregations and individual members can do a lot to promote men's health. If you are active in your faith community, here are some ideas for integrating men's health awareness into the life of your congregation:Men's groups can invite healthcare professionals to address the group on common men's health issues, including heart disease, mental health, accidents and fitness.June is Men's Health Month. Place informational posters and literature around the house of worship. Men's groups can arrange field trips to health fairs that offer screenings for many men's health conditions.Make use of your community kitchen to offer healthy cooking demonstrations. Many men enjoy cooking but may not know how to prepare food in a way that is delicious and nutritionally balanced. Encourage men to get real about their mental health. Men sometimes feel embarrassed about reaching out for support. Learn about stress, depression, anxiety and other mental health issues and develop positive strategies for helping men get treatment.Offer to provide rides to doctor's offices and hospitals.Talk to the women in your congregation about the importance of men's health. Wives, mothers, daughters and friends can play an important role in encouraging men to get regular checkups and make healthy lifestyle changes.Encourage men to incorporate health concerns into their spiritual practices. Prayer, meditation and works of charity can reduce stress and improve life satisfaction.June is also a great month to celebrate the Wear Blue campaign. This program, sponsored by the Men's Health Network, raises awareness of men's health by encouraging groups and communities to wear blue on a selected day. Choose a Wear Blue day and encourage your community to get together in support of men's health.Focus on men's healthMany men focus on their jobs and families but don't pay enough attention to staying healthy. In fact, a recent study showed that men are 24% less likely than women to have seen a doctor over the past year. This means that many men are not getting the preventative health care that can make a huge difference in the length and quality of their lives.The top causes of death for men are heart disease, cancer (with prostate, lung and colorectal being the most common) and accidents. To some degree, all are favorably impacted by making good choices.June is Men's Health Month, a time for celebrating men and encouraging them to lead healthy lives. Here are some things that men can do to protect their health:Reduce stress by developing a strong work-life balance and getting mental health support when needed.Make appointments with health care professionals and discuss concerns and lifestyle goals.Quit smoking, get enough sleep and moderate alcohol use.Develop a healthy eating and exercise plan.Stay up-to-date on vaccinations.Develop a relationship with a physician. Regular doctor's visits allow both patient and doctor to monitor blood pressure, weight, blood sugar, mental health and other body systems. Having a consistent record of these numbers and concerns can help health professionals identify potential problems while they can be most effectively treated.Men who haven't seen a doctor in a while might think about booking an appointment in June. It's a perfect time to get serious about health.Regular checkups save lives.June IsMen's Health Month "}
