The objective of the study is to investigate whether high dose vitamin C infusion leads to pathological tumor response in resectable colorectal, pancreatic, and lung cancer (cohort A) or objective tumor response in KRAS or BRAF mutant solid tumors (cohort B). For Cohort C, the primary objective is to determine that maximal tolerated dose of the combination of high dose vitamin C with Y90 radioembolization for patients solid tumor malignancies and liver metastases amenable to local-regional therapy Patients in cohort A receive a high dose vitamin C infusion for 4 days per week for 2-4 consecutive weeks prior to surgery. Patients in cohort B receive high dose vitamin C infusion for 4 days per week for up to 6 months or disease progression. Cohort C will receive high dose vitamin C for 1-3 weeks. During week 1 vitamin C infusion and Y90 radioembolization of hepatic metastases will occur same day. A tumor sample will be resected after completion of study drug (high dose vitamin C infusion) treatment to examine the effects of study drug (Cohort A only). In addition, organoids will be grown in vitro and continue to be treated with vitamin C added in culture medium to examine tumor response. The resected tumor in this study will Key eligibility: - Men and women age 18 and older - Patients with histologically proven early stage or locally advanced colorectal adenocarcinoma, lung cancer or pancreatic cancer, who are eligible for resection, and have not received chemotherapy or radiotherapy (cohort A) Patients with inoperable, metastatic, KRAS or BRAF mutant colorectal adenocarcinoma, lung cancer and pancreatic cancer, who have received at least 1 line of treatment for metastatic disease (cohort B) - Patients with metastatic cancer with an extended RAS (e.g. KRAS or NRAS) or BRAF mutation with liver metastases amenable II Study of High Dose Vitamin C Intravenous Infusion in Patients With Resectable or Metastatic Solid Tumor Malignancies| |Actual Study Start Date |Actual Primary Date :||April | Vitamin C infusion will be administered intravenously at 1.25 g/kg for 4 days per week for 2-4 consecutive weeks (cohort A) or up to 6 months (cohort B).

Other Name: Ascorbic Acid - Change in antitumor activity measured by pathologic response based on tumor regression grading in cohort A patients. [ Time Frame: cohort A - 8 weeks ]measured by tissue analysis of tumor cell death and fibrotic response in Cohort A subjects - 3-month disease control rate (DCR) will be evaluated using RECIST v 1.1 in cohort B patients. [ Time Frame: Cohort B - 3 months ]Examination of subjects with stable disease, a partial response, or complete response. - Maximal tolerated dose of high dose vitamin C in combination with Y90 radioembolization [ Time Frame: Cohort C - 16 weeks ]Maximal tolerated dose will be evaluated by assessment of dose limiting toxicities for multiple dose levels - Progression-free survival (PFS) [ Time Frame: cohort B - up to 6 months cohort C - 16 weeks ]Defined as the time from registration to cancer progression or death due to any cause - Objective response rate (ORR) [ Time Frame: cohort B - up to 6 months cohort C - 16 weeks ]Examination of patients with a partial response or complete response based on RECIST 1.1 Criteria. - Assessment of pharmacokinetics of high dose vitamin C plasma levels concentrations [ Time Frame: cohort A - 8 weeks, cohort B - up to 6 months, Cohort C - 16 weeks ] - Safety of high dose vitamin C administration using CTCAE 4.03. [ Time Frame: cohort A - 8 weeks, cohort B - up to 6 months, Cohort C - 16 weeks ] - In vitro activity of vitamin C in tumor organoids [ Time Frame: cohort A - 8 weeks, cohort B - up to 6 months ]Molecular signature of vitamin C efficacy will be determined using RNA sequencing and compared between KRAS or BRAF mutant vs wild type tumors. Organoids will be prepared from resected tumor samples and treated with vitamin C. - Exploratory biomarker samples from tumor tissue will be collected at the time points specified in the protocol. [ Time Frame: cohort A - 8 weeks, cohort B - up to 6 months, Cohort C - 16 weeks ]To explore potential correlation of gene expression pattern with anti-tumor activity of vitamin C, we plan to perform RNA sequencing using surgical sample in cohort A patients who will receive vitamin C infusion pre-operatively. - Pharmacodynamic samples from tumor tissue will be collected at the time points specified in the protocol. [ Time Frame: cohort A - 8 weeks, cohort B - up to 6 months, Cohort C - 16 weeks ]Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for GLUT1 protein expression will be performed Fixed Paraffin Embedded (FFPE) tumor tissues. Immunohistochemical (IHC) be performed on Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded (FFPE) tumor tissues to assess AMPK activation. Choosing to participate in a study is an important personal decision.

Note: If subject refuses chemotherapy and therefore has no prior chemotherapy, they can be eligible for the trial with approval from the primary investigator. 3.1 Patients with metastatic cancer with an extended RAS (e.g. KRAS or NRAS) or BRAF mutation with liver metastases amenable to Y90 radioembolization (cohort C). - ECOG performance status 0-1. - Life expectancy of at least 6 months. - All women of child-bearing potential and all sexually active male patients must agree to use effective contraception. - Patient with adequate organ and marrow function as follows: - ANC 1000 mm3, platelets 100,000/mm3, hemoglobin 9 g/dL, - serum aspartate transaminase (AST) 2.5 times the upper limit of normal if no liver involvement or 5 times the upper limit of normal with liver involvement. - Patients with serum electrolytes (including calcium, magnesium, phosphorous, sodium and potassium) within normal limits (supplementation to maintain normal electrolytes is allowed). - Patients taking Vitamin C will have stopped taking oral vitamin C more than 1 week before planned study treatment. - Patients capable of understanding and complying with the protocol and who have signed the informed consent document.

Patients who have the inability or unwillingness to abide by the study protocol or cooperate fully with the investigator or designee. 9. Patient who are receiving drugs which are known to interact with Vitamin C, potential risk and eligibility will be evaluated individually by the investigator. a. Most of the known interactions with vitamin C are from oral use and acidification of the stomach lining. There are few known interactions with high dose intravenous vitamin C. We recommend not using deferoxamine as there may be an association with ventricular dysfunction (unknown mechanism). 10.
