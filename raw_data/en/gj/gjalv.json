It has become a global movement with a range of practices. The essence of clean eating is eating whole, minimally processed foods \u2014 foods that are as close as possible to their natural state. This means a diet rich in fresh vegetables and fruits, whole (unrefined) grains, legumes, nuts and seeds, and most fish. A person who practices clean eating tends to avoid processed foods, most preservatives, artificial ingredients and other additives, including sugar or salt. Variations of clean eating might emphasize seasonal, locally sourced or organic foods or animal products from animals that have been raised humanely and without antibiotics and growth hormones. Clean eating could mean well-balanced meals consumed slowly and deliberately. For some clean eaters, foods must be raw, water must be filtered, and caffeine and alcohol must be avoided. For others, clean eating could refer to consuming foods that are gluten free, dairy free or non-GMO (genetically modified organism). The terms \"natural\" or \"authentic\" are frequently used to describe clean foods, while clean food products could be described as those that list only real, simple, recognizable, and easy to pronounce ingredients on their labels. Regardless of how it's defined, clean eating is associated with a healthy lifestyle. At its core, clean eating aligns with four basic principles of a plant-based healthy diet. 1. Meals and snacks primarily include: 2. Foods are cooked using low-fat methods: 3. Portion sizes are tailored to individual energy needs. 4. Time is taken to appreciate and enjoy the meal. What differentiates clean eating from conventional healthy eating is the process of food selection. Following the principles of healthy eating, either clean or conventional, provides a variety of health benefits: In addition, clean eating is good for the environment. As a social good, the process of obtaining clean foods can be empowering and can enhance life satisfaction. On the other hand, when the search for clean food becomes an obsession; when entire food groups are judged to be insufficiently clean or acceptable and are, therefore, excluded from the diet; or when clean food practices interfere with social interactions, clean eating becomes a problem. At its most extreme, clean eating is disordered eating with risks to physical and mental health. Healthy eating is good for you and your family. Clean eating can be good for you, your family and the environment. But, depending on your level of commitment, clean eating could be resource intense, entailing a great deal of time, effort and expense. It might be more realistic to start with a few small steps: Over time, these small steps could make a big difference in your health and in the health of our planet. "}
