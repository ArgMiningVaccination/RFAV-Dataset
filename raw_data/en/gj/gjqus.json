Even one case at Cornell would constitute an outbreak and prompt a public health response. Cornell University is working with [Tompkins County Whole Health](https://www.tompkinscountyny.gov/health) (Tompkins County's health department) to ensure that our campus remains safe and that we are prepared to respond in the event of an outbreak. It is important for staff and faculty to be aware that should an outbreak occur on campus, exposed individuals without records of immunization could be subject to county-mandated quarantines or exclusions that could impact one's ability to remain on, or return to, campus until such restrictions are lifted.
