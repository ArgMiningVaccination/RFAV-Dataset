We're all familiar with the convenience of curbside service\u2014from grabbing a coffee to picking up a prescription at the pharmacy. COVID-19 has increased the demand for new, safer curbside conveniences and the health care industry\u2014including the pharmacy\u2014has transformed rapidly to meet patient needs and prioritize safety as a result of the pandemic. In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released [special guidance for pharmacies during COVID](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/pharmacies.html)-19, including revised procedures on how to: Pharmacists stepped up to the challenge last year to offer curbside vaccines during flu season to protect their communities. In an effort to reduce physical touchpoints, many pharmacies began adopting paperless solutions to organize documents and increase workflow efficiencies, streamline patient intake, and enhance the overall patient experience. Now with the Moderna, Pfizer, and Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccines [authorized and recommended to prevent COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines.html), pharmacies are again ramping up to accommodate the influx of shots in arms safely and conveniently. Expediting the Vaccine Process with Electronic Fax and Digital Forms: Lessons Learned from Flu Season [Powell Pharmacy](https://powellpharmacy.com/) in Powell, Ohio, has traditionally administered vaccines in-person at the pharmacy. But like many other facets of patient care, COVID-19 drastically changed that. In order to maintain social distancing, limit physical touch points, and still provide patient care, last year the pharmacy ditched the traditional clipboard, pen and paper to [begin leveraging paperless technology](https://www.updox.com/solutions/office-productivity/electronic-forms) to administer flu shots. Prior to using these tools, each vaccine took approximately 10-15 minutes from start to finish. Now it's just mere minutes to administer the shot. Relying on new innovative solutions, such as secure text and electronic forms, allowed the pharmacy to administer 3 times as many vaccines compared to the year prior. In addition to the efficiency aspect, adopting this technology and creating a curbside system enabled the pharmacy to not only provide a safe and convenient experience for patients, but also streamlined their ability to test for COVID-19 antibodies. Using lessons learned and best practices from flu season, the pharmacy is also now well prepared to seamlessly administer the COVID-19 vaccine when their supply is received later this Spring. In an environment in which many COVID-19 vaccine appointment scheduling and communications systems have patients frustrated, having a workflow in place ahead of time that can be easily rolled out is important to patient engagement and the success of the pharmacy. Ditching the Clipboard and Creating a Completely Paperless Practice Pharmacies have always been an essential part of a patient's care plan, but in today's new age of healthcare consumerism, it's crucial that pharmacy technology mirrors the efficiency of that in a traditional doctor's office. Pharmacies can easily implement a full virtual care strategy that is not only cost-effective and resource-efficient, but that also improves the patient experience via no-touch patient management, ongoing patient communications and secure communications solutions. [Research has shown that 69% of Americans visit their pharmacy at least every month](https://blog.updox.com/updox-resources/elevating-healthcares-most-accessible-care-provider). Considering the new expectations of the pharmacist as a result of COVID-19, pharmacies must commit to ditching the clipboard and implementing paperless technology in order to be more efficient. In doing so, pharmacists can: As the industry continues to streamline and eliminate outdated processes, such as manual fax and long waiting lines, patient expectations will continue to transform. In order to ensure a smooth transition into this new era of patient care, pharmacies should consider implementing a full virtual care strategy that prioritizes the use of technology, enhancing the patient experience and increasing productivity\u2014 ultimately simplifying the business of health care.
