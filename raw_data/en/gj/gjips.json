What do you love most about summer? Warm days, trips to the beach, long bike rides, green trees and colorful flowers, the taste of ripe, juicy strawberries? At this time, the sun will reach its highest point over the equator, and we will bask in its warmth and revel in the longer days. This intense, high energy light and warmth is symbolic of the process of creation; the sun symbolizes awakening and enlightenment, and it speaks more deeply than to our skin taking on a tan. It stirs the light within each of us. It challenges us to live to the full potential of our individuality and also, to unite with others and lift up our communities. We enjoy the fullness of earth's bounty, partaking in fresh fruits and vegetables by visiting farmer's markets, join- ing CSA's, and working in our own gardens. In the evening, we gather together, sitting around bonfires, which are a tangible celebration to the connection of the sun, and we laugh, sing, and tell stories. Writer Henry James is quoted as saying, \"Summer afternoon - summer afternoon; to me those have always been the two most beautiful words in the English language.\" Yet, a word's power only comes from the meaning to which it has been assigned. So, unleash your inner sun- shine, use your creative power, and define your summer afternoon: enjoy the light of the sun, breathe the warm air, eat locally grown produce, and walk a restorative path. Consider the story you are creating as you live your life. Awaken and grow into your full self. Then, enlighten those around you just by being the most authentic ver- sion of you, and share the bounty this season celebrates.

The main homeopathic remedy for poison ivy rash is Rhus toxicodendron, 3 to 5 doses can be taken daily for the first few days. In tougher cases, if a different remedy is needed. Consider Croton tig-lium or Anacardium orientale. Typically, Croton tiglium works rashes that occur on the face; whereas, Anacar-dium indications may include rashes that have a blistery type appearance. In addition to homeopathic antidotes, herbals that are helpful for clearing the toxins out of the bloodstream include Nature's Sunshine blood cleaning formula, BP -X or Oregon Grape. To minimize the inflammation reaction of the body, high doses of Vitamin C and Protease Plus, an enzyme that neutralizes the protein poisons, can clear up the most ex-treme cases. Miracle II neutralizing gel topically greatly reduces the itch. Of course, it is best to avoid this plant when possible and wear protective footwear, clothing and disposable gloves if needed. Poison Ivy Remedies By Rachel Friesen, ND Poison Ivy is a spring and summer rascal that we see causing customers severe irritating rashes on the original contact area and often, spreading far beyond that! For those who are allergic to its toxic ingredient, urushiol, having home remedies on hand during the summer months is crucial. One of the most important things to do after being exposed to urushiol is to wash the affected area with dish soap; the quicker the toxic compound is removed from the skin, the less time it will have to react to cause irritation. After this, apply either bentonite clay or activated charcoal topically to the affected areas: this will draw out any remaining toxin.

(It even sounds ominous, doesn't it?) While most of the world is excited about this and telling us that we should be excited, too, there are some very valid reasons to be seriously concerned. 5G is the \"5th Generation,\" or latest generation, wireless network in mobile technologies and cellular telecommu- nications. Because the current frequency bandwidths are being over saturated by cell phones and similar technology, and because we want more, and we want it faster, 5G is being born to promise us super fast down-load speeds (10 Gigabits per second), unrestricted call volumes, near infinite data broadcast, \"smart\" cities that have better energy usage and reduced commuting times, as well as connection to self driving cars, washing machines, and other utilities and devices. It is expected to be 10 to 100 times faster than the 4G technology we use now and capable of supporting 100 billion devices. In order to fulfill all of those wonderful promises, 5G must rely primarily on the bandwidth of the MMW (millimeter wave) which is between 30GHz and 300GHz. These high frequency waves have shorter wavelengths, so they can't travel far. Another problem is that MMW's do not travel well through buildings, and they tend to be absorbed by rain and plants. Because this interferes with the signal, 5G will use smaller cell stations that will scramble and unscramble and redirect packets of data. So, this could lead to wireless antennas on every utility pole, lamp post, business, and home in entire towns and cities. This would create unprecedented exposure to wireless networks using a technology that has not been widely used before with unknown consequences to public health. 6 Further, the current 4G cell towers have about a dozen antenna ports to support communication, while the 5G cell towers will carry about a hundred ports. These tow- ers will be about 4 feet tall (compared to the 90 feet tall 4G towers), the cells will be available within a 100 meter range, and the smart antennas will be able to differenti- ate between various mixed signals. 5G will break down data and send it with only a 1 millisecond delay versus the 50 millisecond delay of 4G. Marcus Weldon, the CTO of Alcatel Lucent comments, \" Up until now, we've designed the networks for people and their needs, and now, we're designing it for things. \" (Did you catch that? Things .) So, why is there reason for concern? First, the Interna- tional Agency for Research on Cancer, an agency of the World Health Organization, declared in May 2011 that radiation from cellphones was a Group 2B \"possible car-cinogen,\" meaning a possible cancer -causing agent. Also, the $25 million dollar National Toxicology Program concluded that radio frequency radiation of the type cur- rently used by cell phones can cause cancer. And, ac-tually, there are thousands of studies showing that low level wireless radio frequency exposures are linked to a number of adverse biological effects including: DNA single and double strand breaks, disruption of cell me-tabolism, generation of stress proteins, oxidative dam- age, increased blood brain barrier permeability, disrup- tion to brain glucose metabolism, and melatonin reduc-tion. There are even more health concerns mounting regard-ing 5G. One of the biggest new concerns is how 5G will affect the skin. Our sweat glands act like antennas when exposed to these wavelengths, meaning that we become more conductive. This can have an impact on the nociceptors in the skin that flare up in recognition of damaging stimuli; in other words, it could create physical pain as well as creating skin diseases. The waves also penetrate 1 to 2 millimeters of human skin tissue and are absorbed by the surface layers of the eye's cornea. Because of this action, this technology could worsen problems with antibiotic resistant bacteria and lead to greater production of cataracts. Also, low levels of nonionizing radiation have already been linked to disturbances and health issues in bees and birds, and since the MMW's are absorbed by both rain and plants, other environmental concerns begin to be posed. If the water that falls from the sky is irradiat- ed, and the plants are showing stress protein changes because of the radiation they have absorbed, and hu-mans and animals both consume plants for food, we will be left with food that is not safe to consume. By Amy Jo Howard, ND, CN Oh, and did anyone mention that the global 5G wireless network requires the use of rockets to deploy satellites which release black carbon into the atmosphere and can disturb the ozone? So, yes, faster technology is convenient, but how con- venient is a world whose food can no longer feed your body which, by the way, is in constant pain all over eve- ry inch of your skin? 5G is expected to be fully implemented by 2020; howev-er, technology companies and certain cities are already working on switching over. Once 5G is installed in your neighborhood, there is no choice to opt out. If you would like to be involved in keeping 5G out of your com- munity, please contact your legislators and voice your opinion. You can also learn how to write, call or email the relevant agencies to protest against the 5G deployment by going to: parentsforsafetechnology.org .

This is also the time when the dreaded allergy symptoms start to appear. The itchy eyes, runny nose, and sneezing can be incredi-bly annoying and can take the enjoyment out of the amazing diversity in season that we are lucky to experi- ence in Michigan. Many people turn to over -the-counter medicines such as Benadryl to help with allergy symp-toms. However, these medications just suppress the symptoms and don't allow true healing within the body. All allergies, food and environmental, are caused from a leaky gut imbalance. This is where there are small tears in the intestinal lining where particles leach right into the blood stream. These particles don't have to just be from ingested substances in order to be related to a leaky gut issue. The particles that are in the blood stream cause a histamine reaction within the body that causes these symptoms to appear within the body. Although many people are stuck with the belief that aller- gies are something that they will be plagued with for the rest of their days, there are many natural options that a person can employ in order to heal their bodies. Many talented naturopaths have the ability to perform an allergy correction that trains the body to stop responding in an unfavorable way to these substances. Probiotics and en- zymes play an essential role in the allergy response. By supplementing with products such as Protease Plus or Probiotic Eleven by Nature's Sunshine, the deficiencies within the body are built back up to where they should be. Histablock and homeopathic antidotes are used in order to help stop the histamine reaction within the body. An- other product carried at Herbs etc is Restore, a blend of amino acids and minerals designed to heal and seal the gut lining. Talk to your local naturopath to determine the best option for you, and begin the healing process in a natural and balanced way! Herbs etc 5G Protection Products Carbon 60 Silica G5 Selenomethionine Orgonite Safe Space - Room Harmonizer ORME's 8 At Herbs etc we are always looking into the best ways to safely and naturally improve health. In this present age, we are deal- ing with mineral deficient food, exposure to loads of environ- mental poisons, and the bombardment of electromagnetic smog. Instead of focusing on all of the \"bad\" stuff, we have to be a part of the solution by spreading wisdom and awareness along with the solutions instead of perpetuating fear. Here at herbs etc we have brilliant doctors who have developed impressive protocols to repair damaged DNA, safely eliminate toxins, and approach the human organism from an unparalleled holistic perspective to help our clients achieve health and harmony. We are excited to share with you that we now offer one of the most fascinating forms of supplementation which has origins that date back to ancient Egypt. Have you ever heard of the term \"Alchemy\" or the \"Philosopher's Stone?\" Our ancient ancestors were well aware pf the enhancements monoatomic elements made to the human body and DNA. These obscure teachings of higher wisdom and health are gaining a resur-gence. \"Orbitally Rearranged Monoatomic Elements\"(ORMEs) were discovered in 1975 by an Arizona farmer named David Hudson. These elements exist both in a material and an immaterial, energetic form. They are also referred to as \"M -states.\" ORMEs are superconductors and these elements resonate with the pri-mal zero point energy from which all life originates. This allows for a quantum potential of possibilities. They are super absorba- ble and have the ability to correct DNA and repair health men- tally, spiritually and physically. Herbs etc now sells ORMEs from a company called ZP.Tech ZP.Tech (Zero Point Technologies) is the largest producer of M-State solutions worldwide. Through metallurgy, science, exploration and more, ZP.Tech aims to be the world's most highly regarded health company. ZP.Tech focuses on increas- ing quality of life and solutions to the most profound mysteries in medicine.

Are you listening? Just 50 years ago, 1 in 100 dogs got cancer. Today, it's 1 in 1.65 dogs that will be diagnosed with cancer this year. Cancer is currently the leading cause of death in dogs (excluding euthanasia by humans for various reasons). Skin disease is the leading reason for elected euthanasia and why people often surrender dogs to shelters. These dogs are literally living with debilating chronic dis -ease their entire lives - and much worse - living in the torment of their own skin. Same with humans, chronic dis -ease for dogs is really a state of imbalance. And it begins with symptoms... UTI's, diarrhea, itchiness, ear infections, yeast overgrowth, anal gland issues are all an effort to say, \"Hey, I'm out of balance!\" When we simply \"treat\" or suppress the symptoms using drugs, the issues don't go away. In fact, it only pushes it deeper down in the tissues and creates a much bigger problem for the dog in the future. Except for the case of true emergency, when your dog communicates with you by showing a symptom, always seek ways to help your dog heal using natural modalities. The pet health crisis is real. Our pets can't protect them- selves - so it's up to us to help them achieve balance in a toxic world. And it's time for us to include our four -legged loved ones on our quest to living a more nourished life. Let's look at four ways to get your dog started on the jour- ney to real preventative care and root cause healing. Let Food Be Thy Medicine What you choose to feed your pet is the foundation of their health. And, let's face it, much of the pet food we find on shelves today is filled with chemicals. Processed pet kibble taxes the liver and increases general toxin levels. Processed wheat and corn are NOT healing foods. Not for humans. Not for dogs. They irritate the GI tract, cause a sudden increase in blood glucose (raising the glycemic index, affecting inflammation in the body), are carbohy- drates that contribute to obesity, diabetes, arthritis, and inflammation, and are genetically modified. And here's more truth to consider, dry kibble can sit in a dog's diges- tive tract like a cement block, sucking up all the body's moisture just to move through. This can cause kidney disease and overall weakness; ultimately, this process is creating dehydration and stripping the dog's minerals. Think about it, without minerals the body can't make or use incoming vitamins. It's a big problem! Watch out for the table scraps like sugars, grains, white potatoes, wheat, corn, syrup, breads as these are most likely only contributing to acidity and inflammation in your dog's body. Carbs increase inflammation! Chronic, hidden inflammation is a silent killer. It's the root of nearly all dis- ease. If it's a healing food, give it. If it's a hurter, put it in the compost or the trash! I recommend feeding your dog a balanced raw food diet which includes meaty bones, muscle meat, organ meat and fruits and veggies. If feeding kibble, opt for a grain -free version and soak with a little bone broth. (Note: dogsnaturallymagazine.com is a phenomenal resource for recommendations on raw feeding.) YOUR DOG'S HEALTH DEPENDS ON YOU By Tonya Holcomb, N.T. 13 Your Dog's Source of Water Matters Just like humans, pets need clean, filtered water. Consider supercharging his water by adding in cell salts. Healthy cells are essential for a healthy body, and cell salts can be used to restore balance in the body's cells. This is one of the simplest, affordable, and most effective remedies to begin adding into your dog's diet immediately. BioPlasma is a combination of all 12 cell salts and is a great place to start. Simply add the pellets to your pup's water, and you'll likely notice some positive changes in overall vitality. Fill in the Nutritional Gaps In today's toxic world and soil depletion, dogs need whole food supplements to help fill in the nutritional gaps, too. Here's a few of my favorites: Herbal Trace Minerals is a combination of kelp, alfalfa and dandelion. Rich in minerals, this blend was originally designed as a supplement for pets. It prevents fleas, improves healthy skin and coat. Just dip the tablet in coconut oil and give to your dog. Liquid Chlorophyll is nature's blood -cleanser for animals. It helps red blood cells take up oxygen and supports the immune system. It aids in digestion and deo- dorizes the body. Chlorophyll, with its pH of about 11, will help to create an alkaline body as well as dump toxins out of the cells. Simply add a splash to fresh water. Turmeric is an amazing herb. It has antioxidant, anti - inflammatory, antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, wound healing and anticancer activities. Turmeric can be hard for your dog to absorb by itself, so be sure to combine it with a healthy oil like coconut. While turmeric works and is safe, it is a \"warming\" spice, so if your dog is always hot and seeking out cool floors, turmeric may not be for him. Pau d'arco kills yeast (especially candida overgrowth) and viruses, expels parasites, relieves inflammation (and therefore pain), enhances immune system function and fights free radicals. It really shines to heal serious internal or external fungal infections. Hemp -Derived CBD Oil gives the healing of cannabis without the high as there are only trace amounts of THC. It's incredibly calming to the body and supports both chronic and acute dis -ease. Studies show that CBD Oil reduces anxiety, fights cancer, treats seizures and epilepsy, relieves pain, reduces chronic inflammation and autoimmune dis -ease, promotes cardiovascular health, aids digestion, and so much more. Holistic vets are also finding CBD Oil to be useful in treating acute ailments like sprains, strains, torn ligaments, bone breaks and even during post -operative care to reduce swelling, pain and stiffness. CBD is a proactive preventative (or even life - saving) herb to many of the issues pets develop. Be sure to choose a quality CBD oil that has lab test results from accredited third party testing facilities. Living Pet Probiotic contributes to the health and balance of the intestinal tract by supplying the necessary \"friendly\" bacteria for proper digestion and bowel health. The digestive system is the first line of defense for the immune system. Just add to water and you will see within days, your animal will be livelier and energy levels will increase significantly. Embrace Routine Cleansing It just needs to be done - the natural way, of course. Pets, like hu- mans, can't escape toxins. Because the liver works so hard at filtering and eliminat- ing all of these toxic substances, it is highly susceptible to serious damage. Milk Thistle is a beautiful restorative herb that not only prevents damage to the liver, but also helps to repair it. Consider adding Milk Thistle into your dog's protocol routinely with the seasons, such as every spring and fall. Trust as with all things, baby steps are the best place to start. Add a little bone broth to your dog's food, start incor- porating raw scraps and meaty raw bones when you can. STOP feeding your dog carbs of all kinds (yes, even when they give you those puppy eyes)... Use real food treats instead. If your dog has serious health issues, don't fall victim to suppressing the issues deeper in the tissues. In-stead, work with a Naturopath to get to the root issue. Just like with humans, the root cause of all dis -ease is toxicity and nutritional deficiency. And the more we build up the body with minerals, the more the body will naturally push out the toxins.
