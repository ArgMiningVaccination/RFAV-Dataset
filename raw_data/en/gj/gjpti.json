To many, homeopathy seems implausible. They fear it is purely a placebo effect or worse, a form of deception or quackery. Yet, homeopathy has been around for over 200 years and is used by millions worldwide. The film explores the controversy, dispels myths and misconceptions, and asks whether or not homeopathy has been given a fair shake. SOME OF THE CHARACTERS YOU WILL MEET THE KORNS When their son Lucas is diagnosed with autism, the Korn family in New York set out on a mission to bring their boy back. When conventional medicine offers few answers, they turn to homeopathy with surprising results. ALEX TOURNIER AND RACHEL ROBERTS Alex is a physicist who contracted an illness that conventional medicine could not help. After trying homeopathy, which he called \"the least impressive medicine,\" he got better. It became his life passion to figure out how it worked. He founded the Homeopathy Research Institute (HRI), a charitable organization in London whose mission is to explore the science behind homeopathy. RACHEL ROBERTS was studying biology when she first heard about homeopathy and thought it was \"bollocks.\" After investigating further she changed her mind and later joined Alex as the CEO of HRI. GERRY DENDRINOS In Australia, a major government agency undertook an extensive review investigating the effectiveness of homeopathy. Their study concluded: \"There is no evidence that homeopathy works.\" Gerry is a homeopath and former government employee who suspects this review is flawed and begins an investigation to uncover the truth. In India, we learn how homeopathy is integrated into their healthcare system. In modern day England, we see the popularity of homeopathy and how it is presently under attack. Though Her Majesty the Queen credits homeopathy with keeping her healthy for over 60 years, and homeopathy is a part of their National Health System, skeptics are aggressively lobbying to put homeopathy out of business for good. DIRECTORS STATEMENT I am not a homeopath. I have not had a miraculous cure from homeopathy. So why have I persisted with this film? Because I really believe it is a David and Goliath story. My entire career I have fought for the underdog. This is something that has animated my being for as long as I can remember. In my first profession I was a sign language interpreter where I was, literally, giving deaf people a voice. Now that I am a filmmaker, I have continued that thread. Homeopathy has been maligned and misrepresented for 200 years. I want Just One Drop, is give homeopathy a voice, a voice that continues to be misinterpreted. To open up a dialogue, get people talking to each other, asking questions, and sharing information. It is worth stating that homeopathy gained recognition because of it's use in epidemics at the turn of the century. This film that goes beyond just homeopathy. It is about freedom of choice in healthcare THE TEAM Laurel Chiten Producer/Director, Blind Dog Films Laurel Chiten has been critiquing and influencing social issues for over 30 years.
