Diarrhoea remedies are asterisked* Aconite Aconite is the first remedy for shock and fear. Use routinely for veterinary testing, drenching, transportation, pen-crush experiences. Useful when exposure to extreme weather conditions is experienced. Aconite is frequently required at the beginning of disease but not when disease has progressed. Use the M potency frequently e.g. every five or ten minutes if required. Use morning and evening for two days starting on the day of stress. Arnica Arnica is the remedy for falls, blows, bruising, the early stages of strains and haemorrhage. Often used after Aconite has dealt with the shock. Arnica will help the body to heal after Aconite has helped the mind over the shock. Use the 200c potency frequently. Many diseases have their origin in shock. The quick use of the above will largely prevent further illness. Arsenicum album* Arsenicum album is successfully given when the diarrhoea is very smelly and the animals are weak and diseased.
