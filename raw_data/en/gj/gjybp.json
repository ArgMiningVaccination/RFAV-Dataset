Founder of homegrown brand, [Global Beauty Secrets](https://discovergbs.com), Nir has created a label that harnesses the power of innumerable, global, lesser known natural ingredients and traditional beauty rituals to create effective products and results. Global Beauty Secrets has it roots in Ayurveda, a discipline Nir has followed for the longest time now. This, coupled with her interest in spirituality, led her to meld the two in a unique set of products that focus on time-tested principles of beauty and wellness. Nir, who is based in Mumbai, says that she can trace her interest in the idea back to days she spent in her grandparents' home while growing up. The age-old Indian Hindu ritual of Panchamrit that was performed there was her first inspiration; the idol being bathed in the five elements - milk, curd, honey, holy water from the Ganges, rose and kewda itar. She applied saffron and milk regularly during these pujas, and was gifted kesar on multiple occasions. Years later, this triggered her to look at ancient rituals in the pursuit of [beauty](https://lifestyleasia.com/ind//ind/beauty-grooming/skincare/these-are-the-best-australian-beauty-brands-for-indian-skin/) and wellness. Nir launched Global Beauty Secrets in 2017, and the past two years have seen the label grow by leaps and bounds.. The fact that she uses research done on natural extracts to create products, and obscure but effective ingredients from all over the world, have resulted in international orders coming in. From Turkish rose to Japanese Adzuki Bean to Indian saffron, the products are further enhanced by the traditional rituals that she suggests be followed. Our favourite is the [Ghrit Aarti Skin Salve](https://discovergbs.com/ghrit-aarti-skin-salve.html), featuring ghee and jasmine tuberose that sinks into your skin for complete nourishment. We spoke with Nir on how Global Beauty Secrets is paving the way for integrating wellness into beauty and why rituals are essential in skincare. Tell us a bit about your bestsellers Some of our bestsellers have really unique product stories and these ingredients are seldom used by other brands in India. Our [Adzuki Bean Face Wash](https://www.nykaa.com/global-beauty-secrets-japanese-adzuki-bean-face-wash/p/320963?ptype=product&skuId=320963&ef_id=EAIaIQobChMInavm6-Sl5QIVzYyPCh0TNwefEAQYASABEgLoD_D_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!599!3!383869122205!!!u!584547073905!&utm_source=GooglePaid&utm_medium=PLA&utm_campaign=PLA_FULLSITE_GOALOPTIMISED&gclid=EAIaIQobChMInavm6-Sl5QIVzYyPCh0TNwefEAQYASABEgLoD_D_BwE), [Rhassoul Clay Hair Mask](https://discovergbs.com/turkish-rhassoul-hair-mask.html), and the [French Plum Butter Soap](https://discovergbs.com/french-plum-butter-soap.html) are new to the market. And soon, we will be adding some really exotic ingredients to our Thai and the Japanese rituals too. I truly believe any ingredient from nature is packed with benefits, so obviously the source matters to us. I also believe that there is wisdom that lies beyond our awareness of local ingredients and we should be open to exploring it - that's our mantra. What makes Global Beauty Secrets special? We have a very unique brand philosophy that emphasises on time-tested ingredients from different rituals and cultures, backed by the safety of the latest scientific technology available. So, we are different because we are bringing the diversity of various beauty traditions. Instead of competing with existing brands, we are celebrating the spirit of democracy in this industry that allows every woman to create and curate beauty secrets on their own. Who is the Global Beauty Secrets customer and what is he/she looking for in beauty? I would be very reluctant to say that Global Beauty Secrets is meant only for a certain type of women; our different products cater to different skin types, different tastes, and even different genders. A GBS consumer will definitely be curious for the story, embrace the diversity, experience adventure and love natural ingredients with scientific efficacy, cultural legacy, and women at the helm of its inspiration. Where does Global Beauty Secrets stand on in terms of sustainability? Since we are a new brand, we are still taking baby steps towards how we can craft this brand more consciously and continue to achieve excellence with finesse. We are clear about partnering with local communities for ingredient-sourcing and gift-based collaborations. We have also successfully replaced our plastic tubs with glass jars for most of our product range. Creating a brand like Global Beauty Secrets from scratch, how challenging was it? GBS has a very complex curation of products and the biggest challenge sometimes is just to tell the story in the most enthralling way. How do you see luxury in beauty? I think the luxury industry is witnessing a revolution. Luxury is no more now just about finesse, it's about finesse with consciousness. Today, people measure the value of the product not just in terms of what is being offered to them, but also what is it offering to the community.
