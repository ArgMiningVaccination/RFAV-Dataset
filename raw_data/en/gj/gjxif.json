Research with nonhuman primates often serves as a critical link between basic science and human clinical application. Following are examples of how research with nonhuman primates has helped advance science and medicine. 1900s - Components of blood and plasma discovered - Treatment of pellagra 1920s - Diagnosis and treatment of typhoid fever 1930s - Modern anesthesia and neuromuscular blocking agents - Mumps virus discovered 1940s - Treatment of rheumatoid arthritis - Discovery of the Rh factor, blood-typing knowledge critical for safe blood transfusions 1950s - Polio vaccine - Chlorpromazine and its tranquilizing derivatives - Cancer chemotherapy - Yellow fever vaccine 1960s - Mapping of the heart's connections to arteries - German measles vaccine - Therapeutic use of cortisone - Corneal transplants 1970s - Treatment of leprosy - Procedures to restore blood supply in the brain - Interaction between tumor viruses and genetic material - Understanding of slow viruses, which linger in the nervous system - Research leading to EPA ban on PCBs 1980s - Cyclosporine and anti-rejection drugs - Processing of visual information by the brain - Physiological and psychological co-factors in depression, anxiety and phobias - Treatment of malnutrition caused by food aversion following chemotherapy - Treatment of congenital cataracts and \"lazy eye\" in children - First animal model for research on Parkinson's disease, enabling doctors to more accurately research human Parkinson's disease - Heart and lung transplant to treat cardiopulmonary hypertension - First Hepatitis B vaccine - Rhesus monkey model for AIDS used to establish the effectiveness of early administration of AZT in cases of diagnosed infection - Taurine added to infant formulas. An amino acid in breast milk, taurine is necessary for normal retinal development 1990s - Estrogen controls an enzyme key to making serotonin, the brain chemical that regulates mood: first step to providing effective medications for postpartum, postmenopausal, and menstrual cycle related depression - Toxicity studies for education and prevention of childhood lead exposure - First controlled study to reveal that even low-to-moderate levels of alcohol can be dangerous in pregnancy - Breakthroughs in understanding the mechanisms of puberty and puberty disorders - First monkey, then human embryonic stem cells successfully isolated and cultured - Control of intimal hyperplasia - The drug Ecstasy causes long-term brain damage - Parent to child lung transplants for cystic fibrosis - Monkey model developed for diabetes research - Regenerative mechanism discovered in the mature primate brain, spurring new research toward curing Alzheimer's and other degenerative brain disorders - Wild primate species help characterize emerging infectious diseases - Better understanding of influenza and knowledge for better vaccines - Development of anthrax vaccine - Development of life-saving medications for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) - Essential research leading to new therapies and preventive strategies for HIV 2000s - Gene that boosts dopamine production and strengthens brain cells used to successfully treat monkeys showing symptoms of Parkinson's Disease - Monkey model developed to study the effects of malaria in pregnant women and their offspring - Cyclospora, a food-borne pathogen, characterized in primates - Beneficial effects of controlled calorie restriction on primate health and longevity - Better medications for people with insulin-dependent diabetes - Research leading to Cweet, a natural sweetener safe for people with diabetes - High blood pressure medications to prevent heart attack, stroke, and kidney failure - Patients receive hip replacements and are no longer confined to wheelchairs - People with degenerative eye diseases see more clearly - Better medications improve the lives of people with severe depression, bipolar disorder, and other psychiatric illnesses - Better pre- and postnatal care for pregnant mothers and infants - Earlier diagnoses and better treatments for polycystic ovary syndrome, endometriosis, and breast cancer - Improved treatments help more men survive prostate cancer - Vaginal microbicides to help HIV-infected mothers give birth to HIV-free infants - Secondhand and smoke shown to affect prenatal, neonatal and child lung development, cognitive function and brain development - Exposure to wildfire smoke adversely affects development of the immune system - Understanding the effects of Bisphenol A (BPA), used commercially in plastics, on prenatal development 2010s - Pluripotent stem cell research moves into preclinical and clinical trials (e.g., Parkinson's, heart disease, blindness), and also drug testing and environmental toxin screening - Macaques are prime model for developing Ebola treatments and vaccines - Identifying the actions of infectious agents that can cause miscarriages (such as listeria) and birth defects (such as Zika virus) 2020s - Macaques are primary model for basic research to understand SARS CoV-2 pathology and for developing vaccines for COVID-19.
