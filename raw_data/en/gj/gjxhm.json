I like it really thick, almost like a slab. I spread Marmite on toast as thick as jam. My mum used to love Marmite, but I couldn't even stand the smell. I grew to like it when I went through puberty. I always buy honey, the clear runny type. Sometimes I put it on my face to soften and refresh it but I mainly buy it to have in my herb tea - camomile really relaxes me, and I drink it all day. I always have salmon in any form really - smoked, tinned, grilled. I marinade it in a little teriyaki sauce and then cook it in foil. I also like to cook a roast chicken and then I pick at it all week. I'm also mad about peas, especially tinned mushy peas. My favorite carbohydrate is oven chips, - I get the healthy ones with only 5% fat. I usually keep a few cans of Mackeson's stout in the fridge. I love to have a little half pint with my dinner. It's sweeter than Guinness and it feels medicinal. I've always loved apples, any sort, as long as they're crunchy. I've discovered Benecol Light cheese spread. I slap it on a baked potato or spread it on Ryvita. For comfort food I don't think anything can beat a good old plain Cadbury's chocolate bar. I get very suspect about all these products that advertise themselves as being 'fat free' when, if you look at the ingredients they are stuffed with sugar. I think that if you are going to have sugar you might as well have a bar of chocolate. I also love wine, strong fruity wines where only a glass or two and you feel very relaxed. Red wine Red wine can keep the heart healthy by increasing the body's production of 'good' cholesterol and providing it with such antioxidants as quercitin and procyanidin, which inhibit two of the steps in the chain of events that leads to the production of fatty plaques and hence blocked blood vessels. Too much alcohol, however, can send your energy levels crashing, upset your mood, disrupt your sleep and increase your risk of developing liver disease. Benecol cheese spread Many people buy Benecol products because of the evidence that their plant esters can slightly improve the blood-fat profiles of people who have cholesterol problems. Yet not only are they expensive, but I prefer other nutritional ways of reducing your risk of developing heart disease. One of the best is to ensure that your intake of monounsaturated fats is high by regularly eating oily fish, peanuts, almonds and walnuts, as well as using olive oil or other vegetable oils. If, like Josie, you crave the taste of cheese, top a slice of fibre-rich, wholemeal bread with a sliver of naturally lower-fat cheese like Gouda. Chicken In common with all protein-rich foods, chicken contains amino acids that can stimulate the body to generate endorphins like serotonin that make you feel happier (a useful quality in Josie's profession) and more energetic. As well as being naturally low in fat and protein-packed, chicken doesn't prompt the body to produce 'bad' cholesterol, making it a healthy choice for people who are trying to lose weight. Chicken also contains high levels of zinc, the mineral that is vital for the maintenance of an efficient immune system and robust libido. I would urge everyone to buy organic, free-range chicken, which usually tastes far better than chicken that has been intensively farmed. Mackeson stout A point in stout's favour is that it frequently contains half the alcohol content of wine. Stout contains a few B vitamins and a little iron, giving credence to the old wives' tale that a glass of stout is a good tonic. Porridge oats Oats are extremely high in fibre, making them one of the healthiest foods you could eat. They also contain a prebiotic agent called beta glucan, which encourages the growth of probiotic(healthy) bacteria which in turn stimulates the production of cancer-fighting substances. Because oats have a lower gluten content than wheat, people who have a gluten intolerance can safely enjoy a bowl of porridge or biscuits made with oats rather than flour. Mushy peas Although fresh peas contain some vitamins and minerals, by the time they've been processed, few nutrients are left other than fibre. Fibre, however, plays an important role in keeping your digestive system healthy, and since mushy peas are soft, they're usually better for people who have digestive conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis and diverticulitis, than fresh peas. Herbal teas You're probably tired of hearing that your body needs 2.5 litres water a day, but it's nevertheless true. Brewing herbal teas can be one of the best ways of jazzing up water and they often have inherent healing properties. Camomile acts as an effective destresser and sleep-inducer, while mint soothes an acidic gut and aids digestion. Marmite Marmite-lovers, particularly vegetarians and vegans, benefit from its high vitamin B content, vitamins that are mainly found in foods of animal origin. Because it contains high levels of salt, Josie should eat potassium-rich foods, such as fresh fruits and vegetables, as well as drink lots of water. Low-fat oven chips Low-fat oven chips are both less hassle to cook and significantly lower in calories than conventional, deep-fried chips. Despite their 5 per cent fat content, they still contain more calories than jacket potatoes and other non-fried foods, however, so think twice before piling them onto your plate. Cox's eating apples Although an apple contains only 6mg of vitamin C per 100g, it can pack as much antioxidant punch as three 500mg vitamin C tablets because, unlike the tablets, it contains plant (or phyto-) nutrients and other powerful antioxidants. Its fibre can kick-start a lazy gut, while its nutrients can stimulate the body to produce substances that are particularly effective in reducing incidences of cancer of the digestive system. If eaten as part of the same meal, an apple can cushion the body's absorption of animal fats (in cheese, for instance), as well as providing a quick, convenient and energising snack. Organic honey Although organic honey provides your body with a generous dose of energy-raising sugar, it has the same potential downsides as all types of refined sugar, including weight gain and dental cares. When consumed on an empty stomach, honey can send your energy levels soaring, at the same time, however, stimulating your pancreas to produce insulin, the hormone that will bring them rapidly down again, making you feel shaky. It's therefore best eaten with a fibre-containing food, like wholemeal, rather than white, toast. "}
