Many people are greatly concerned about their future safety. Some have considerable reservations about venturing outside of their homes, but are still seeking means of supporting their immune systems against potential viral infection. There is an option at hand. The Holistic Healing Heart Center is once again offering IV therapy in Los Angeles, with the potential for house calls in cases where patients are unable to come to the office. We are offering IVs for individuals who want to improve their preparedness for the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). There have been [clinical studies and trials performed on COVID-19 sufferers](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04264533), testing the effectiveness of IV vitamin C (also known as ascorbic acid). Taking oral doses of supplements to boost vitamin C levels can be a beneficial habit, in the absence of certain medical conditions. However, the gastrointestinal tract is limited in the amount of vitamin C it can absorb. Delivering high doses of vitamin C and vitamin C combinations into the bloodstream allows higher absorption rates, meaning greater bioavailability to the cells that need it. Another IV that can offer benefits to those without symptoms or with only minor symptoms is IV Ozone. Ozone IV Therapy For Boosting Your Immune System This treatment has been around longer than antibiotics: 150 years. Ozone gas is antimicrobial, killing bacteria, funguses, and viruses alike. The effects of ozone therapy are: - Sanitizing the blood - Killing 'bad guys' - Relieving the immune system, allowing it to concentrate on invaders outside of blood vessels. High Dose Vitamin C IV Treatment and COVID-19 The Holistic Healing Heart Center is offering a 20 gram dose of vitamin C in an IV. This is a therapeutic dose, safe for the majority of people, and supports immune system functionality. The dose also features electrolytes to balance the vitamin C. [Studies show a lack of vitamin C increases susceptibility to viruses.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5409678/) Vitamin C plays a role in reducing inflammatory responses, and neutralizes free radicals. It's well known for what it can do for a body's immune defenses. Many choose to receive both IVs at the same visit. 'Piggybacking' the vitamin C after the ozone gives a patient's body the 1-2 punch needed to give them a better chance against viral issues.
