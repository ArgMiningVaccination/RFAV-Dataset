Dar\u00e9, in collaboration with SST, is developing Sildenafil Cream, 3.6% as a potential treatment for female sexual arousal disorder (FSAD). Sue Goldstein, CCRC, AASECT-CSE, Clinical Research Manager at San Diego Sexual Medicine, presented positive findings from a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-way crossover study that used thermography to assess pharmacodynamics of Sildenafil Cream, 3.6% in healthy women. \"The study findings showed statistically significant increases in genital temperature, a surrogate for genital blood flow, and self-reported arousal response within thirty minutes of application of Sildenafil Cream when compared to placebo, demonstrating that Sildenafil Cream elicits a quantifiable, rapid genital response,\" said the principal investigator for the study, Dr. Irwin Goldstein, Director of Sexual Medicine at Alvarado Hospital and Director of San Diego Sexual Medicine. \"There are currently no FDA-approved products for the treatment of FSAD, so these findings are encouraging and demonstrate the potential of Sildenafil Cream to become an important new therapy for women with FSAD.\" FSAD is a condition characterized primarily by an inability to attain or maintain sufficient genital arousal during sexual activity. Sildenafil is the active ingredient in Viagra\u00ae, the orally administered treatment for erectile dysfunction (ED) in men. As with ED in men, FSAD in women is associated with insufficient blood flow to the genitalia. Sildenafil Cream, 3.6%, a proprietary cream formulation of sildenafil for topical administration to the vulva and vagina, is designed to increase genital blood flow and provide improvements in the female genital arousal response while avoiding systemic side effects commonly observed with oral formulations of sildenafil. Market research suggests that 33% of women in the U.S., ages 21 to 60, experience symptoms of low or no genital arousal during sexual activity, and 16%, or approximately 10 million women, are distressed and are seeking a solution to improve their condition. As [previously announced](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Iu1McMHqjQ5wo_tioqWawEJtRs-EyOPjzjOKEJdLDTd3KcWIpYUEyMiKjLtsRDM6p8Xai_adRNu7YtlBxQr4WwIVeHLnDn34BdQde4dz5idbRud3bsHp_HiiVXcxbyW9XLVBxoL5RFReGFF6ej476b-C8z5ejApTZ5iUsPLFAxpFGVWke1keQ4RTNO2W7A173aSXJdEWgMaUPve2r1CI6smhvG46Ctkm8hpwVfrixKg=), the study was designed to evaluate the feasibility of thermography to assess the pharmacodynamics of Sildenafil Cream. Six women aged 25 to 55 without sexual dysfunction were recruited to participate, the median age was 36.3 years. All participants passed a comprehensive medical screening at Visit 1 to be eligible to participate in Visits 2 and 3, which had a 2-way crossover design. Genital and thigh temperature (non-genital control) were remotely recorded during each visit using the FLIR\u00ae system Thermos Vision A320 thermal imaging camera and FLIR Research IR v4.4 software. Genital temperature data were analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), with time in minutes as the repeated measure and cream condition as the independent variable. There were statistically significant differences between Sildenafil Cream and placebo cream, as well as the no cream condition. As shown in Figure 1 below, Sildenafil Cream produced a statistically significant greater linear slope during minutes 11-15 of the sexually explicit film as compared to placebo cream. The study is part of a comprehensive clinical development and regulatory plan for Sildenafil Cream that Dar\u00e9 intends to implement in collaboration with SST. The development plan includes assessing the safety and efficacy of Sildenafil Cream in Phase 2b and Phase 3 clinical studies. \"The results of this study reaffirm our commitment to develop a first-in-category product to address a persistent unmet need in women's health,\" said Sabrina Martucci Johnson, President and CEO of Dar\u00e9 Bioscience. \"FSAD is a challenging and highly prevalent condition with no FDA-approved therapies currently available. We are leveraging a well-established PDE5 inhibitor, sildenafil, and delivering it in a novel way to potentially offer women a new solution to a very distressing condition.\" A copy of the poster presented at the Sexual Medicine Society of North America Conference is available on the Events and Presentations page of Dar\u00e9's investor relations website (http://ir.darebioscience.com).
