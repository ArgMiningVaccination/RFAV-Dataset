The Portuguese, like most colonizers, viewed a growing and healthy African population as critical to the social and economic development of the colonies, and feared that a population decline would cause a severe shortage of labour needed for the colonial economy. The book examines the fears associated with depopulation, and shows how these fears were reiterated by a steady stream of disturbing reports of deadly diseases, low fertility, high mortality and endemic labour scarcity, expressing deep concern about both the quantity and quality of the indigenous population in Angola. And the book studies the mostly medical policies that were adopted to turn the tide, and how these policies were directed at reducing mortality, increasing natality and improving the overall health of the indigenous population in Angola under colonial rule. 2Coghe's book is divided into six chapters, organized both chronologically and thematically. The first chapter discusses the emergence of depopulation anxieties and population politics in Angola at the turn of the nineteenth century. The chapter describes that even though sleeping sickness (human trypanosmiasis) was known by Portuguese colonial doctors since the 1870s, the rise of a new epidemic during the 1890s triggered unprecedented fears of depopulation among Portuguese colonialists. Coghe examines how Portuguese responses to the problem were informed by both local concerns within the colony, but also by trans-imperial competition and collaboration. In the second chapter, the author delves into the practical efforts to combat sleeping sickness in Angola until the end of the First World War. It is argued that some of the medical responses were similar to responses of other European colonizers in Africa, such as an active search for the aetiology of the disease, the testing of experimental drugs, and the dismissal of local knowledge and mechanisms to control the disease. At the same time, there were particularities to the Portuguese response, and the book presents different perspectives from doctors, village headmen, local officials, and patients. An important insight that this chapter provides is how sleeping sickness was successfully eradicated on the island of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe - an achievement that was acknowledged at the time but has received little attention in the literature. 3The third chapter covers the debates leading to the establishment of the AMI program (Assist\u00eancia M\u00e9dica aos Ind\u00edgenas, or \"Native Medical Assistance\") in the interwar years. Initially focused on sleeping sickness, the AMI was founded in 1926 and became part of a collective and preventive healthcare approach for \"caring for the healthy\" during the interwar period. Ant\u00f3nio Damas Mora, the health services director at the time, broadened medical services through competition and consultation with colleagues in neighboring colonies, with \"mutual learning\" also supported by the League of Nations and the Rockefeller Foundation. On the one hand, competition between colonial empires encouraged the 'learning from others', and to adopt best practices. On the other hand, it also led to the showcasing of national ingenuity and special care for African populations to impress audiences at home and colonial competitors, while the actual introduction of new methods and drugs was often less substantial. However, by the 1930s, doctors in Angola were calling for broader approaches to improve the general health situation, including smallpox vaccinations, the treatment of sexually transmitted infections and hygiene education. Barriers to successful implementation of such approaches included the absence of training for African doctors and high-handed methods that did little to build trust between Portuguese physicians and the local population. A key accomplishment was the training of African nurses who carried out important health work despite systemic discrimination. 4Chapter four addresses the flawed nature of demographic data and interpretations that were often devoid of scientific rigor and used to serve a particular purpose and Coghe examines this through the work of doctors as \"field demographers\" and population experts in tropical Africa. The chapter studies why, how and by whom demographic data in Angola were produced and how this information was subsequently interpreted and used within the colonial discourse. It shows that, as in other African colonies, demographic data was often scarce and unreliable, especially before 1940. It also discusses how the various colonial departments involved in gathering the statistics had their own methods and objectives and this influenced the kind of data that was gathered, but also the quality of the data and the various interpretations. 5In the final two chapters, the author highlights the spatial dimension of European population politics in their colonies in the first half of the twentieth century. In chapter five, Coghe focuses on the activities of state and Protestant medical officials, who had a negative image of the competence of African mothers and tried to impose their culture and beliefs on local populations. The author shows that the medical supervisions that were initially focused on sleeping illness shifted towards children's healthcare. Protecting birth rates served as justification for greater intrusions into African lives, particularly around movement, sexuality, and polygamy, as well as in infant and maternal care. Chapter six moves the discussion of depopulation concerns away from healthcare and focusses on the movement of labour. Coghe shows how the colonial government in Angola, fearing that labour migration would contribute to depopulation, clashed with planters and government officials in Portugal who supported out-migration to cocoa plantations on S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe. Similar tensions were also related to recruitment from the Belgian Congo, Northern Rhodesia, and elsewhere for railway and mining work. The Angolan government tried to limit migration through border controls and tax policies, but this had very limited success in curbing out-migration. The Colonial Ministry in Lisbon was often unwilling to support these or other measures, partly due to other priorities, partly due to an unwillingness to grant the Angolan government strong independent policy choices. 6The epilogue carries the discussion forward to the post-WW2 period up to 1975. Inter-imperial exchange in health matters continued along the same lines and with some of the same tensions as it had in the interwar years. However, such efforts became more deeply entrenched within institutional frameworks. The post-1945 expansion of colonial development and welfare initiatives, global decolonization movements after 1950 and nationalist independence movements in Portugal's colonies all served as incentives for Portugal to increase its health investments, in order to defend the legitimacy of its colonial rule. Lastly, unlike many other nations at the time, Portugal maintained its pronatalist policies. Coghe argues that this, along with other factors, may be one of the reasons why Angola has not been able to implement birth control programmes, thus contributing to the country's high fertility rates to date. 7Coghe's book is a thoroughly researched study on health and population politics in Angola using a new and extensive collection of archival material sourced from various locations. It also contributes to the literature by focusing on a former Portuguese colony, which has been an understudied topic within the \"renaissance of African Economic History\" of the last two decades. Coghe's research reveals that the medical system in Angola was not exclusive to Portuguese colonization, but rather a trans-colonial phenomenon. He identifies differences within the imperial system and the common strategies employed for exploitation, modernization of medical services, colonial actors, debates, and policies in other colonies. However, the book explicitly does not want to engage in a more concrete reconstruction of Angola's demographic history. Given the richness of the material collected for the book it seems somewhat unfortunate that not more is done with some of that material towards the discussion of the feasibility of improving historical demographic indicators for Angola. But apart from that, the book is well-structured and easy to comprehend. Importantly, the book strives to uncover the perspectives of African voices by piecing together fragmented records across official and missionary repositories. Coghe's meticulous work in combing through the archives deserves recognition and it is a recommended reading for anyone interested in health strategies in former African colonies.
