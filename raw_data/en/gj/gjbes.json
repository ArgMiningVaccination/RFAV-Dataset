HbA1c full form is hemoglobin A1c or glycosylated hemoglobin. It is a form of hemoglobin that contains sugar. Hemoglobin is a kind of molecule that is present in red blood cells and helps in carrying oxygen to the body's tissue. Read this blog to know what the hba1c test means, the normal range of hba1c chart in detail with cost, and how 1000s of people have achieved normal HbA1c levels through the [Diabetes](https://www.breathewellbeing.in/blog/introduction-to-diabetes/) Reversal Method. Diabetics have a higher amount of glycosylated hemoglobin levels, unlike non-diabetics. Thus, to meet a controlled level of blood sugar, it is better to do HbA1c tests. What is HbA1c or A1c Test Used To Diagnose? The HbA1c test meaning the A1c test, is a crucial tool in diagnosing and managing various forms of diabetes, including type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, [prediabetes](https://www.breathewellbeing.in/blog/prediabetes-a-warning-signal-to-avoid-diabetes/), and gestational diabetes. It measures the percentage of hemoglobin in the blood that has glucose attached to it, reflecting the average blood sugar levels over the past two to three months. Let's learn what is HbA1c test used for. Diagnosing Type 2 Diabetes and Prediabetes The HbA1c test is commonly used to diagnose type 2 diabetes and prediabetes. For type 2 diabetes, an HbA1c level of 6.5% or higher indicates diabetes. For prediabetes, an HbA1c level between 5.7% and 6.4% is considered indicative of higher-than-normal blood sugar levels, warning of potential progression to type 2 diabetes. Early detection of prediabetes allows healthcare providers to implement lifestyle changes and preventive measures to reduce the risk of developing diabetes. Monitoring Diabetes Management For individuals already diagnosed with diabetes, the HbA1c test used for monitoring their blood sugar control over time. The test is typically performed every 3 to 6 months, and the results help healthcare providers assess the effectiveness of the treatment plan and make adjustments if necessary. Maintaining HbA1c levels within the recommended target range is crucial for reducing the risk of long-term complications associated with diabetes. Assessing Risk for Complications The HbA1c test means not just measuring the blood sugar levels, but also assessing the complications. Checking High HbA1c levels over an extended period are associated with an increased risk of developing diabetes-related complications, such as cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, and nerve damage. Regular monitoring of HbA1c levels can help identify individuals at higher risk and prompt appropriate interventions to minimize complications. Type 1 Diabetes Management If we look at the HbA1c definition, it is commonly used for monitoring and managing type 2 diabetes. It is also used in individuals with type 1 diabetes. For people with type 1 diabetes, the test helps healthcare providers assess how well insulin therapy and other treatments control blood sugar levels over time. Maintaining the HbA1c within the target range is crucial for reducing the risk of long-term complications associated with diabetes.

Many people have been able to regularize their Glycated Haemoglobin HbA1c Levels and live a healthy life after successful Diabetes Reversal with Breathe Well-being. The Measure of Glucose in Glycosylated Haemoglobin In the glycosylated hemoglobin HbA1c test, the percentage of hemoglobin that is bound to glucose is measured. The average concentration of blood glucose is reflected in this test after three months. The glycosylated hemoglobin can be measured in percentage or in units of mmol/mol. This is now a standard unit in which glycosylated hemoglobin HbA1c is measured all over the world. Know Your Normal Range of HbA1c With the Help of a Chart With the help of the chart below, you can get an idea if you're in the normal HbA1c range or not. Pay attention to the color keys in the chart to understand the severity of your condition. HbA1c Normal Range for Non-Diabetic, Pre Diabetic & Diabetic Person People can have different normal ranges of glycated hemoglobin hba1c. Here you can check out, with the help of the hba1c normal range chart, what should be the normal levels of glycosylated hemoglobin for individuals: In Non-Diabetic People A healthy person can have an HbA1c normal value of less than 5.7% of the total hemoglobin. Below 5.7%, is the hba1c normal value for a non-diabetic adult. In a Pre-Diabetic Person If your blood sugar levels are slightly higher than the normal range, then you're prediabetic. The prediabetes HbA1c range is between 5.7% and 6.4% (slightly above the normal levels). But your diabetes levels are not too high to be considered type-2 diabetes. With a proper lifestyle and diet management, you can control your diabetes at this level through the Diabetes Reversal Method and can attain a normal prediabetes HbA1c range of less than 5.7%. In Diabetic People For any person suffering from type-2 diabetes then, your HbA1c normal value is 6.5% or above, or 48 mmol/mol or above. This hba1c test range may be normal, but there is a need for proper guidance from doctors and medications along with healthy lifestyle changes to maintain the range. If your value goes beyond the mentioned range then it can increase the risk of heart stroke, peripheral artery disease, glaucoma, diabetic foot, diabetic kidney disease, and more. Over 10000 pre-diabetic and diabetic people have successfully come from the orange and red zone (dangerous, deadly) to the green zone (optimal, super optimal) by making sustainable lifestyle changes. A few people I know didn't believe that diabetes reversal is possible or one can be off diabetes and other medications before they got on a call with us.
