Most [vaccines](/learn/Vaccinations) are routinely administered to clients as part of a [vaccination schedule](/learn/Vaccinations:_Clinical); while other [vaccines](/learn/Vaccinations) are only given to certain populations, such as chronically ill clients or those travelling to foreign countries. Now, there are five main types of [vaccines](/learn/Vaccinations): that have been weakened in the laboratory. As a result, these weakened pathogens are no longer able to cause infection, but are still able to trigger a protective [immune response](/learn/Introduction_to_the_immune_system). These [vaccines](/learn/Vaccinations) are used to protect against [influenza](/learn/Influenza_virus) the [live attenuated influenza vaccine](/learn/Vaccines:_Nursing_Pharmacology) or [mumps](/learn/Mumps_virus), and [rubella](/learn/Rubella_virus), the [MMR vaccine](/learn/Vaccines:_Nursing_Pharmacology), and can include [varicella zoster](/learn/Varicella_zoster_virus), also known as the MMRV [vaccine](/learn/Vaccinations); other include [vaccines](/learn/Vaccinations) for [yellow the other hand, [inactivated vaccines](/learn/Vaccines:_Nursing_Pharmacology) use a pathogen that has been killed in the laboratory, so it is no longer able to replicate or cause infection, but is still able to trigger a protective [immune response](/learn/Introduction_to_the_immune_system). These include [vaccines](/learn/Vaccinations) against [Hepatitis A](/learn/Viral_hepatitis:_Pathology_review), or [HAV vaccine](/learn/Vaccines:_Nursing_Pharmacology), as well as [polio](/learn/Poliovirus), the Salk vaccine or inactivated [polio vaccine](/learn/Vaccinations:_Clinical) or IPV, and against rabies, or the [rabies vaccine](/learn/Vaccines:_Nursing_Pharmacology). [Vaccinations](/learn/Vaccination_and_herd_immunity), also known as immunizations, are a way to protect individuals from infectious diseases. [Vaccines](/learn/Vaccinations) work by stimulating the [immune system](/learn/Introduction_to_the_immune_system) to recognize and fight specific pathogens, such as viruses or bacteria. They allow us to develop active [immunity](/learn/Innate_immune_response:_Nursing) where a protective [adaptive immune response](/learn/Adaptive_immune_response:_Nursing) is made to pathogens without causing disease in the patient. There are four main types of vaccines: Live attenuated, are whole-cell vaccines, which means that the whole virus or bacteria is used to create the [vaccine](/learn/Vaccinations). Subunit and toxoid vaccines are considered fractionated vaccines because only one part of the pathogen is used to create the vaccine. Vaccines are typically given through injections, nasal sprays, or oral doses, and are usually recommended for infants and young children, as well as for adults who may be at risk for certain infectious diseases. Vaccines can sometimes cause mild side effects. There may be pain and swelling at the injection site, flu-like symptoms like fever, malaise, [headache](/answers/covid-headache), and anorexia, that usually last for a day or two. In rare situations, there can be more serious reactions, including prolonged irritability, [seizures](/learn/Nervous_system:_Seizures_and_strokes), [high fever](/learn/Body_temperature:_Clinical_skills_notes), [thrombocytopenia](/learn/Thrombocytopenia:_Nursing), and [anaphylaxis](/learn/Anaphylaxis), as well as rare autoimmune conditions like [Guillain-Barre syndrome](/learn/Guillain-Barre_syndrome). Nursing considerations when administering vaccines include screening for contraindications or cautions to vaccine administration, administering the vaccine, and monitoring for adverse reactions, as well as providing education about vaccine side effects and how to manage them.
