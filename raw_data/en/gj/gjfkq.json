I would like to express my sincere appreciation to everyone who in one way or another facilitated the accomplishment of this study. I thank Almighty God for giving me breath and good health during the entirety of my studies. During my third year (2020), the Covid-19 pa ndemic emerged, which challenged the whole learning and teaching systems. Glory be to God as I survived and kept in the mood for working. I acknowledge gratefully the help of Prof. Dr Julia Tisc hler (University of Basel) and Prof. Dr Jamie Monson (Michigan State University) for thei r supervision and mentorship and for always being available to read my chap ters with a critical eye. They provided several substantive suggestions and alternative perspectives when th e need arose. I am indebted to both of them. I am mindful of the contributi ons of members at the Departme nts of History, University of Basel and Dar es Salaam, who read and comm ented upon parts of my work. Professor Li Anshan of the Peking University shared his painstakingly collected information and publications on Chinese medical teams in differ ent parts of Africa, which were so useful. More importantly, this study was made possibl e through generous financial support from the Humer Foundation for Academic Talent - a three-year PhD scholarship at the University of Basel, Switzerland, from September 2017 to July 2020, and the Forschungsfonds der Universit \u00e4t Basel (Research Fund of the University of Basel) for the fourth and final year of my PhD studies (2020 -2021). I equally thank the Basel Graduate School of History (BGSH), Freiwillige Akademische Gesellschaft (FAG), and Centre for African Studies (ZASB) for their financial support during my fiel dwork in China and Tanzania. I am also indebted to my employer, the University of Dar es Salaam, Mwalimu Nyerere Campus, for the kind assistance and for granting me a study leave in Basel. I want to acknowledge with a lot of gratitude all these supports. My greatest debts are due to archivists and libra rians. I have relied on materials held by the Tanzania National Archives (TNA), Mbeya Records Centre (MRC), Dodoma National Records Centre (NRC), Shandong Pr ovincial Archives (SPA), th e World Health Organization (WHO) Archives, and Universities of Dar es Sa laam, Basel, and East China Normal. Their VIII kind and patient assistance made my data collection processes su ccessful. I am equally grateful to my research assistants in the libraries, archives, and fieldwork. Hamad Mwange assisted with examining newspapers in the East Africana research collections of the University of Dar es Salaam. On the archive part, Li Zuxian a nd Shi Jing did a commendable job in translating Chinese written archival information into E nglish at the Shandong Pr ovincial Archives. Li Mengmeng 's transcription of some Chinese interviews collected was extraordinarily helpful. Their kind assistance addressed se veral hurdles and simplified my research work. I am also indebted to government official s at the Ministry of Health in China and Tanzania and my informants in China and Tanzania for their wa rm welcome, cooperation and hospitality during the data collection processes. Indeed, the informants mentione d provided useful information, which enriched this study. Lastly but of no less importance, my heartfelt gratitude goes to my family - my parents, my father, the late Mr. Azizi Mdota Kifyasi and to my lovely mother Mrs. Agnes Mbonane Mpinge for their support, love, and help with childcare ; to my brothers and sisters Abri, Godluck, Felista and Elizabeth, whose unwavering love a nd support steadied and strengthened me. I am hugely indebted to my love Sa lima and our children Paschal, Anthony, and Alica for their patience and support throughout the bu siest period of my studies.

Andrea Azizi Kifyasi Basel, May 2021 XI ABSTRACT China 's medical assistance to Africa has attracte d relatively little attention from scholars compared to other forms of assistance such as economic and political. \"A Historical Study of China 's Medical Assistance in Post-Colonial Tanzania \" examines the implications of Chinese assistance in the development of Tanzania 's health sector under the discourse of South-South cooperation. Through the use of archival and othe r documentary sources collected in Tanzania, China, and Switzerland, as well as oral histories, this study explores how China 's medical assistance reflected the Southern agenda of promoting self-reliance and lessening the dominance of Northern countries in medical aid and knowledge in the South. It illuminates social, economic, and political cont exts that gave birth to China 's medical assistance in Tanzania. The study shows that, after the Arusha Declaration of 1967, the Tanzanian government adopted Chinese health policies such as free health care, the institutionalisation of traditional medicine, and rural health care. It argues that the adoption of Chinese health policies contested the conceptions of the production an d transmission of knowledge from the North \"core\" to the South \"periphery \". Consequently, the practices of Chinese health policies in Tanzania signal the realisation of knowledge pr oduction and exchange from the periphery to the periphery. Indeed, as the study shows, the independent Tanzanian government aspired to become self-dependent. Such endeavours grew in the mid-1960s, following its diplomatic rifts with traditional donors of th e North. Under idealistic motives of Southern solidarity, it perceived Chinese aid as a bridge to self-reliance, and indeed, this was the \"vision \" of the Chinese government as is evident in its foreign aid principles. In the same vein, the Chinese- funded health projects, such as the medical team program, were expected to build the capacity of Tanzania 's health sector through medical knowledge production and exchanges with local medical workers. The Chinese-sponsored pharmaceu tical industries were planned to maintain the local production of pharmaceuticals and ensure imports, while traditional Chinese medicine research and treatment projects were ex pected to boost medical knowledge among local researchers and practitioners. Nevertheless, this study argues that China 's medical assistance to post-colonial Tanzania was hampered by seve ral drawbacks, which affected its efficiency and sustainability, hence fa iled to realise the country 's anticipated self-reliance. Contrary to the government 's expectations, the assistance created unf oreseen dependences on Chinese medical doctors, pharmaceutical raw materials, trad itional Chinese medicine, and pharmaceutical XII technicians sent from China. Fi ndings of this study show that most of the medical projects declined in the absence of Chinese assistance. Such circumstances warrant the conclusion that despite the merits of China 's aid, especially in counteracting the dominance of medical aid and knowledge from the North, its assistance hardly f unctioned as a sustainable solution to health challenges that faced the Tanzanian govern ment. Admittedly, the medical assistance functioned as a soft way of securing allies during the Cold War era and a vital tool in maintaining China 's political and economic interests.

XVIII 1 INTRODUCTION: CHINA'S ASSISTANCE TO AFRICAN COUNTRIES The Chinese people are our true brothers. When we are in difficulties, China is always the first to stand up and offer help. Salim Kijuu, Regional Commissioner, Kagera.1 The Regional Commissioner of Kagera made the above statement immediately after receiving Chinese medical doctors in his region. The doctors were part of the Chinese medical team working in different regions of the country. They were sent to Kage ra to attend to victims of the earthquake that occurred on Septembe r 10, 2016. The assertion that the \"Chinese\" had been \"always the first\" to support the Tanzanian government di d not only raise my curiosity to study the history of China's medical assistance to Tanzania but al so reflected the practice of the South-South cooperation (SSC).2 Indeed, the contentions imply that assistance has not only flowed from the North - or \"core\" - to the South, the so-called periphery, but also from the South to the South.3 Indeed, historically, the Chinese govern ment began to offer assistance to the nations of the Global South soon after its successful 1949 revol ution. It mostly directed its aid toward socialist countries. For example, in 1950, it deployed economic and social assistance to Vietnam and North Korea. It further assisted other countries of the South, including Egypt, Morocco, Sudan, and Guinea after the Bandung Conference of 1955.4 During the 1950s, China 1 Quoted in a Speech by H. E. Wang Ke, Ambassador of China to Tanzania, at the farewell reception for the 24th China Medical Team in Tanzania held in Dar es Salaam on November 3, 2017. 2 South-South cooperation refers to collaborations that involved exchanges of resources, technology, experience, and knowledge among Global South countri es. Such exchanges are executed at b ilateral, multilateral, regional, or interregional levels, as well as organised and coordinated by Southern countries. SSC was founded following the 1955 Bandung Conferen ce and grew through coalitions among Southern countries influenced by Asian-African conferences and organisations such as the Afro-Asian Peoples' Organisation (AAPSO) 1957, the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) 1961, and the Group of 77 (G-77) 1964. Through SSC, countries of the Global South worked together to find solutions to common development cha llenges. It became possible fo r country members to work together since they had supposed shared history and challenges. Against this backdrop, at the Bandung Conference, delegates of Asian and African countries promoted economic, political, social, and technological cooperation among themselves (discussed at length in Chapter 1). See Isaline Bergamaschi and Arlene B. Rising Donors, New Aid Practices? ed. Isaline Bergamaschi, Phoebe Chinese Foreign Aid,\" in South-South Cooperation and Chinese Foreign Aid , ed. Meibo Huang, Xiuli Xu and Xiaojing Mao (Singapore: Palgrave Macmillan, 2019), 1. 3 The terms \"Global South\" the \"Global Countries\" and \"Developed Countries.\" Fuller explanation is offered in the conceptual framework s ection of this chapter. 4 Mohon Shajalal, et al., \"China's Engagement with Developmen t Assistance for Health in Africa,\" Global Health Research and Policy 2, no. 24 (2017): 2, https://doi.org/10.1186/s41256-017-0045-8 ; Ai Ping, \"From Proletarian Internationalism to Mutual Development: China' s Cooperation with Tanzania, 1965-95,\" in Agencies in Foreign 2 and the Soviet Union offered moral and material support to African countries fighting against imperialism, colonialism, and neo-coloni alism. However, throughout the 1950s, medical assistance was not part of China's aid to the South.5 From the outset, the Chinese government executed its aid through cash, materials, project building, and te chnical cooperation. In 1964, Chinese Premier, Zhou Enlai, explained that the Chinese government's assistance aimed at strengthening the socialist camp, promoting the struggle for political independence and supporting the attainment of self-reliance endeavours in newly indepe ndent African countries.6 However, Zhou did not mention political and economic benefits that the Chinese governme nt aimed to accrue under the umbrella of \"foreign aid\". The Sino-Soviet disputes, which he ightened in the 1960s, le d to the withdrawal of the Chinese government from the Union. Under such circumstances, the Chinese government became both anti-Soviet and anti-Ameri can. In contrast, it bolstered relationships with African countries through different kinds of assistance to win their support.7 Underscoring the role of Chinese aid to winning over imperialis t(s) (USA) and revisionist(s) (Russia), Zhou contended: \"Our assistance to Asian and African countries is keenly important for our competition with the imperialists and revisionists for the middle strip. This is a critical link. It is the material assistance. It will not work without material.\" 8 Aid, therefore, became a useful tool in China's competition with the United St ates and the Soviet Union for political and economic influence over African countries. Through different forms of assistance, the Chinese government craved to be considered as a better ally of African countries than the US and the Soviet Union. Yet, the government of China supplied loans a nd grants only to countries which forged diplomatic relationships with Beijing.

Rotberg (Washington, D. C: Brookin gs Institution Press, 2008), 2. 6 Menghua Zeng, \"An Interactive Persp ective of Chinese Aid Policy: A Case Study of Chinese Aid to Tanzania,\" (PhD diss., University of Florida, 1999), 93-94; Ai, \"From Proletarian Internationalism,\" 170. 7 Tianbiao Zhu, \"Nationalism and Chinese Foreign Policy,\" China Review 1, no. 1 (Fall 2001): 10. 8 Chinese assistance to Africa came wh en a few countries attained their po litical independence, and they faced several economic and social challenges. It was easy for the Chinese government to forge diplomatic relations with independent countries through aid. Likewise, several African countries were fighting for political independence, and freedom fighters needed material and moral support, which the Chinese government promised to offer. Thus, China's material support helped it win Africa's support against Soviet revisionism and US imperialism. For the quote, see Olivia J. Killeen, et al., \"Chinese Global Health Diplomacy in Africa: Opportunities and Challenges,\" Global Health Governance 12, no. 2 (Fall 2018): 6. 3 1963 to January 1964 constituted a landmark for his country's engagements with the continent. Zhou put forward \"Eight Principles for Econ omic Aid and Technological Assistance to Overseas Countries\" which showed the visions of China's fo reign aid and the direction that the Sino-African cooperation was supposed to take.9 During this period, medical assistance was provided for the first time, when in 1963, the Ch inese government sent its medical team to Algeria to address health challenges and bu ild the capacity of Alge ria's health sector.10 The government further supported different developm ent projects for newl y independent African states. For instance, in 1964, it provided a lo an amounting to USD 156.40 million to six African states: The Central African Republic (USD 4 million), Congo Brazzaville (USD 25 million), Ghana (USD 20.4 million), Kenya (USD 15 milli on), Tanzania (USD 42 million), and United Arab Republic (now Egypt) (USD 50 million).11 This assistance played a vital role in boosting Sino-African cooperation. The period from 1966 to 1977 witnessed a furt her increase in Chinese assistance to Africa. Medical assistance was extended to several African countries (Chapter 3).12 Furthermore, the Chinese government heavily de ployed loans and grants to Africa, and it financed massive projects such as the Ta nzania-Zambia Railway (TAZARA). Between 1970 and 1977, the total aid sent to African states amounted to USD 1.9 billion.13 Indeed, China's assistance to Africa throughout the 1960s to 1 977 laid a solid foundation for Sino-African relations which, in turn, meant that the Chinese government won recognition in the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). In the 26 th UNGA of October 1971, UN member countries endorsed the proposal of restoring China's legitima te seat in the UNGA, with 26 African countries voting in favour of recognising the legal status of the Chinese government.14 9 The principles, among others, underscored China's commitment to promoting self-reliance to aid recipient countries.

This reduction was consistent with China's reform and opening-up policy, as its foreign assistance became more pragma tic than ideological. After the reform, the government of China used foreign aid programmes to attain economic development. Above all, it reconciled with the US and enlarged its opposition to the Soviet Union. Surely, China's increased diplomatic proximity with the US and other countries of the North aimed to attract foreign investment and win a dvanced technology from them. 15 Yet, the adopted policy had negative impacts on Sino-African cooperation becau se it resulted in a significant decline of foreign aid to African countries. For example, China's aid to Africa dropped from USD 100.9 million in 1976 to USD 13.8 million in 1982.16 Likewise, medical assistance to the continent declined tremendously. Li Anshan notes that from 1979 to 1980, there were no Chinese medical teams sent to Africa. Although the program re sumed in 1981, there was no increase in the number of the teams from 1988 to 1995.17 China's thirst for Africa's natural resources prompted the resumption of its assistance to the continent from 1995 to the present.18 The Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), inaugurated at Beijing in Octobe r 2000, deepened its roots in Africa. FOCAC conferences were scheduled ever y three years. Through FOCAC, China enhanced its influence in the continent by meeting heads of African st ates or their representatives where several economic, political, social, and technological ag reements would be signed. Moreover, the Chinese government used the FOCAC forum to pump different kinds of assistance into several African countries.19 The forum promoted bilateral tie s and cooperation be tween China and Africa through dialogue.

Southern countries with relatively strong medical institutions, such as China and Cuba, were the first to provide medical aid to other Southern countries, through which medical knowledge a nd experiences from donor and recipient countries were exchanged.22 Not only was there a strong historical rela tionship between China and Tanzania, but the Tanzanian political elites were also chief al lies of SSC. Julius K. Nyerere, then President of Tanzania and Chairman of the South Co mmission, supported the South-South knowledge production and exchange agenda vigorously, believing that it was crucial for sustainable development.23 Nyerere's commitment to SSC expande d the country's re lationships with economically powerful Southern countries such as China, Cuba, and India, and in exchange, Tanzania received several kinds of assistance fr om these countries. For instance, from the mid- 1960s to the 70s, Tanzania became China' s largest aid recipient in Africa.24 1.

It specifically investigates the social, economic, and political contexts that gave birth to China's medical assistance in Africa. By critically discussing a ra nge of major Chinese-funded hea lth projects since Tanzania's independence in 1961, it analyses the ways in which Chinese medi cal assistance contributed to nation-building agendas in Tanzania as well as in promoting South-S outh medical knowledge production, exchanges, and self-sufficiency within Tanzania's health sector. This work contributes to research on SSC, particularly by examining economic, political, and knowledge entanglements that em erged from bilateral relationships among Southern countries. The study also provides insights into the post- colonial diplomatic history of Sino-African relations, especially in the field of medical diplomacy. While increasing numbers of scholars have stud ied Chinese economic and politic al assistance to African countries in the post-colonial period, China's engagement in Africa's health sector remains neglected (see below). The study further adds insights into ongoing debates on \"Theory from the South\", which underscores the roles that Southern countries have played in scientific developments and challenges the supposed monopoly of the Global North on science and innovation (see below). The thesis examines the ways in which medical assistance provided by some economically powerful countries in the South promoted innovation in medical knowledge and challenged the hegemony of medical knowledge from the Global North. The emergence of donor countries from the South ne twork has not been adequately studied as a shift away from the dominance of Northern and formerly colonising countries. The main argument of this study is that China's medical assistance, despite some positive effects, did not reliably promote the de velopment of Tanzania's health sector. The assistance provided was executed under idealis tic motives of Southern solidarity, which promised to promote self-dependence on the part of the newly independent nations. Yet, its execution was hampered by several drawbacks, whic h affected its efficiency and sustainability. China's medical aid, which political elites in Tanzania generally perceived as \"unconditional\" and \"emancipatory\", created unforeseen dependencie s, which, in turn, led to the collapse of most projects funded by the Chinese governme nt. For instance, the two pharmaceutical industries funded by the Chinese government in 1968 were handed over to the Tanzanian government, which had neither enough skilled pharmaceutical personnel nor effective management capacity to run them. Moreover, there was no reliable source of pharmaceutical raw materials (Chapter 5). Similarly, as will be shown in Chapter 3, the Chinese medical team program, which commenced in 1968, prioritised clinical care rather than fostering medical 7 knowledge exchanges with local medical personnel. Research and treatment programs in the field of traditional Chinese medicines further prompted the spread and practice of Chinese medicine instead of imparting medical know ledge to traditional Tanzanian medicine practitioners and researchers (Chapt er 4). Therefore, throughout this study, it will be seen that despite the merits of China's ai d, especially in counteracting the dominance of medical aid and knowledge from the North, there was a significant gap between \"promise\" and \"practice\". Rather than creating a basis of skills, infrastructures, and ma terials on which it could have functioned more autonomously an d sustainably, Chinese assistan ce worked as a short-term relief to long-term deficiencies w ithin Tanzania's health sector. 2. Situating the Study: Literature Review The existing research literature shows that training local medical workers was not a priority of the colonial governments. However, the increasing health challenges, the limited number of medical workers in the colonies, an d the colonial ambitions to popularise western biomedicine prompted colonial administrations to launch medical training for at least a few Africans from 1900 onwards. David F. Clyde, Randall M. Packard, John Iliffe, Hellen Tilley and Stacey A. Langwick provide insights into the ways in which colonial authorities introduced and popularised biomedicine in Africa while undermining the survival of the existing indigenous medical practices and approaches.25 Clyde and Iliffe discu ss how colonial experts imparted Western medical knowledge to a few Africans who worked as medical assistants, sanitary inspectors, dispensers, and tribal dressers.26 A study by Iliffe and Langwick went further by examining how medical training progre ssed in post-colonial East Africa, showing the ways in which the new governments i nvested in training medical personnel.27 Thus, the advent of Chinese medical training on the cont inent collided with existing medical knowledge systems shaped by the former colonial power, but existing scholarship has not yet shed light on how Chinese medical knowledge challenged the prevailing system and hegemony of 25 David F. Clyde, History of the Medical Services of Tanganyika (Dar es Salaam: Government Press, 1962); Randall M. Packard, A History of Global Health: Interventions into the Lives of other Peoples (Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2016); John Iliffe, East African Doctors: A History of the Modern Profession (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998); re ad the Introductory Chapter in Helen Tilley, Africa as a Living Laboratory, Empire, Development and the Problem of Scientific Knowledge 1870-1950, (United States of America: University of Chicago Press, 2011); Stacey A.

The ways and the extent to wh ich Chinese medical knowledge was imparted to the local medical workers requires further investig ation to identify its broader implications for post-colonial Tanzania's health sector. This study also contributes to studies on Tanzanian socialism in the postcolonial period. Scholars have examined, for instance, implications of the policies for economic activities such as agricu lture, industry, and commerce - reporting nuanced observations.28 Other studies examined the impact of the policies in light of the environmental harm that was done through such projects. They show that socialist policies went hand in hand with the villagization scheme, which interfered with ex isting land-use patterns an d disrupted ecological relationships between people and th eir natural environment. This, in turn, led to environmental degradation.29 Generally, the available research liter ature criticises socialist policies in Tanzania - especially on how the govern ment implemented the policies - underscoring that they made little or no significant contribution to its self-reliance endeavours. Research has paid little attention to health as a major field of Af rican socialism and self-sufficiency. This study covers this gap by examining the implications of socialist policies on health care. By examining the Tanzanian government's attempts to establish a socialist health care system, the study sheds light on the extent to wh ich the policies adopt ed were, in one way or an other, linked to Chinese interventions. 28 Several scholars studied implications of Ujamaa polic ies in the development of agriculture, industries, commerce and rural transformation. For instance, Idrian Resnick maintains that under the Ujamaa policies, the government perceived industrialisation as key economic takeoff and it invested much on it while fewer efforts were made to produce and improve skilled manpower to run th e established industries; as a result, many industries collapsed. Read, Idrian N. Resnick, The Long Transition: Building Socialism in Tanzania (London: Monthly Review Press, 1981). Yet, several scholars maintain that under Ujamaa policies, the rural transformation was arduous since the vision of the policies was not clearly inte rpreted and adopted by officials and peasants; thus, the policies ended in futility. Read, for instance, Priyal Lal, African Socialism in Postcolonial Tanzania: Between the Village and the World (New University Press, 2015); Jannik Boesen, Tony Moody, Ujamaa-Socialism from Above (Uppsala: Scandinavian Institute of African Studies, 1977). Further studies maintain that villagization policies implemented by the government under Ujamaa policies were a mess to rural communities' livelihoods since they led to the decline of farming activities.

Chuhila, \"Agrarian Change Villages in Tanzania: Analysis of a Social Experiment (London: Heinemann Educational Books, 1979); Andrew Coulson, Tanzania a Political Economy (New York: Oxford University Pr ess, 1982); James C.

They have not examined the implications of the socialist polic ies that the country a dopted in 1967 to develop the health care system in any systematic ma nner. In addition, given their theoretical and methodological frameworks, exis ting studies have overlooked the extent to which SSC influenced the production and circulation of medical knowledge. This study investigates the ways in which the young, low-income nation of Tanzania drew on Chinese aid and knowledge in its government endeavours to offer free health care, institutionalise traditional medicine, provide rural health care, and ban private health practices. This study also draws from several studi es on Cuban medical internationalism, showing that Cuban medical as sistance operated under specific criteria. For instance, some recipient countries exchanged Cuban medical ai d with resources or trade agreements. Yet, under the banner of \"humanita rianism\", the Cuban government provided free medical assistance to low-income countries and states affected by disasters such as floods and earthquakes. 32 Thus, the Cuban government reaped concrete benefits from its medical missions. The available literature on Chinese assistance to newl y independent African nations does not adequately discuss the (d esired) benefits that China mi ght have gained from its long- 30 Iliffe, East African Doctors ; Amon J.

Several economic projects funded by the Chinese government in Africa in the 1960s and 70s have been of interest to scholars. The Tanzania-Zambia Railway (TAZARA), for instance, which was among the most significant projects funded by the Chinese government in Southern countries, has been investig ated by George Yu and Jamie Monson.34 Among others, Monson shows the ways in which socialist and ca pitalist visions of deve lopment competed in this period of the Cold War, as the TAZARA project coincided with the construction of the highway from Dar es Salaam to Zambia funded by the US government. In the Chinese socialist vision, the railway project sought to alle viate Zambia's depe ndency on \"capitalist\" Rhodesian, Angolan, rails and ports by promoting African nations' self-reliance.35 This study examines the manifestation of similar ideo logical clashes in heal th projects funded by the Chinese government and traditional donors fr om the North in Tanzania, as well as the motivations behind Chinese medical aid, which the existing scholarship has neglected. There is some research on the Chines e medical teams (CMTs), pharmaceutical industries built by the Chinese, and much less on traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) in Africa. Such works, however, are both broad and general in their approa ches and do not show subtle changes in the funded projects over time. Furthermor e, they do not uncover the implications of Chinese medical aid in prom oting self-reliance and South-South medical knowledge exchange. For instance, some existing literature has examin ed the activities of Chinese medical doctors in Africa without establis hing the systematic history and contexts that gave birth to their interventions.36 Yet, some medical aid projects funded by the Chinese 33 Read, for instance, Shuang Lin, et al ., \"China's Health Assistance to Africa: Opportunism or Altruism?\" Globalization and Health, (2016): 1-5, https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-016-0217-1 ; Li, Chinese Medical Cooperation in Africa ; Peilong Liu, et. al ., \"China's Distinctive Engagement in Global Health,\" Lancet Ch Medical Cooperati on Still Going Strong After 50 Years,\" (August, 2013). 34 George T.

Methodologically, available studies on Ch inese medical aid have relied on oral testimonies, institutional and government repo rts, and personal observations as primary sources, neglecting archival sources almost entirely.39 As a result, they ha ve not considered the nuanced history of the emergence, development, and implications of Chinese medical aid to the development of health sect ors in recipient countries. This study pushes further the discussion about the manner in which and the extent to which countries of the South engaged in the fight against pandemics in other Southern countries using the Chinese-funded HIV/AIDS and anti-malar ia campaigns in Tanzania as focal points. Up to the present, the contribu tions of Southern countries in battling pandemics have been of little interest among schol ars, creating the impression that c ountries of the South had nothing or little to offer in response to global health ch allenges. Studies into the global health campaign by Amy Patterson, Randall Packard, and John Iliffe underscore the roles of traditional global health partners such as the USA, the Eur opean Union (EU), the WHO, the World Bank, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.40 Very little is current ly known about China's multilateral engagement in global health from the turn of 21st century onwards following its domestic health crisis and ec onomic interests in Africa where medical assistance has become an essential component of Chin a's projection of soft power.41 Although the available literature 39 See, Shen and Fan, \"China's Pr ovincial Diplomacy to Africa\"; Kadetz and Welfare\"; and Huang, \"Domestic Factors and China's Health Aid Programs in Africa.\" Very few studies integrated some archival information bu t with limited oral testimonies from ke y respondents, see, for instance, Li, Chinese Medical Coop eration in Africa; and Altorfer-Ong, \"Old Comrades and New Brothers. Lack of relevant sources limited historical understanding of several Chines e medical aid projects in Af rica. For instance, Hsu and Jennings maintained that activities of the Chinese doctors working under the TAZARA project influenced the positive reception of TCM clinics in Tanzania, while arch ival information suggests that activities of Chinese medical doctors and the practice of acupuncture therapy from 1968 onwards gave a chance to the penetration and positive perception of TCM clinics in the 1990s.

Bilateral medical projects with individual countries in the South that were funded by the Chinese government are essential areas for research attended to in the present study.42 Scholars have debated SSC in rather contr oversial terms. Some emphasise the fact that China's current engagement was linked to the country's aim to exploit natural resources in low-income countries and that its growing n eeds for these resources mostly influenced the strong relationship between China and Africa in the 2000s, referring to China's engagement as the \"second colonisation of the African continent\".43 By contrast, othe rs argue that the increased cooperation between China and Afri can governments has been serving mutual benefits, bolstering their argumen ts with statistics that reflec t the extent to which African countries have benefitted from cooperation wi th China. Scholarships for African students, medical assistance, infrastructure projects as well as economic investments and trade relationships are mentioned as prime examples of such positive effects.44 The debate on China's recent influence in Africa has overl ooked the fact that elements of Chinese humanitarianism, respectively imperialist tendencies, have been present in its medical aid to Africa since its commencement. 3.

Thus, it challenges the long-standing sophism that globally relevant knowledge has always emanated from European and North Amer ican countries and that Southern regions of the world have been on the receiving end or delivered - at best - raw data incorporated into sophisticated theories by Northe rn researchers. Indeed, it empow ers countries which have been conventionally ill perceived as peripheral, primitive and underdeveloped. Scholars who subscribe to \"Southern theory\" have emphasise d how Southern countries became centres for the production and circulation of knowledge a nd innovation within the Southern world and beyond Southern borders, showing that southe rn countries developed genuine and self- conscious modernity as well.45 Consequently, Southern c ountries produced undisputed advancements in science and technology from the ancient to the modern periods. To be sure, the colonization of Southern countries had impeded knowledge production processes. Nevertheless, colonies remained critical sources of knowledge and innovation for the development of modern states of the North.46 Indeed, the view that countries of the Global South have been the ar chitects of science, technology and innovation is not new but links up with older Afrocentric scholarship. Among others, Cheikh Anta Diop held the view that Africans were genuine architects of Ancient Egypt's civilization, which then spread to the North and South.47 Theory from the South develops such thoughts further, building on previous criticism. In the fiel d of medical history, scholars such as Helen Tilley have discussed the ways in which the Global South became a source of \"raw data\" for the Global North - how treatments were tested and plant knowledge exported to the North. Tilley adds that much of the knowledge colonial authorities gathered from local experts and their experiences in the colonies have been unacknowledged or 45 Jean Comaroff and John L.

Admittedly, precisely defining the \"Global South\" and the \"Global North\" is difficult. The terms, however, are alternatives to denominations like \"Third World/Developing Countries\" and \"Developed Countries.\" The use of these terms si gnals the downfall of the tripartite/hierarchical division, wh ich dominated the Cold War period.49 Julius K. Nyerere, then Chairman of the South Commission, defined Southe rn countries by referri ng to their interests, connections, and determinations in relation to the \"underdeveloped\" and the \"highly developed\" nations. In this regard, geography, ideo logy, and economic achievements are not decisive influences for identification since countri es such as China, India, Brazil, South Africa and a few others have a per capita income higher than some countries of the North such as Albania, Kosovo and Yugoslavia. Certainly, coun tries of the South were members of the Group 77 (G-77), or the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). They share basic characteristics such as being former colonies or protectorates, havi ng a comparatively low GDP, and being excluded from international economic decision-making institutions such as the World Trade Organization (WTO), United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), World Bank, and International Monetary Fund (IMF ). In sum, these are countries that would be associated with the \"periphery\" and lack of political and economic power from a perspective of World Systems Theory. 50 With such a view, I trace initiativ es made by countries of the South to enable the development of knowledge production following the Bandung Conference in 1955 and the Afro-Asian Peoples' Solidarity Or ganisation (AAPSO) ins tituted in 1957. Thus far, scholars have not linked these organisatio ns with the ongoing \"Theory from the South\" debate. I examine how these movements, which were formed at the height of the Cold War, conceived and developed the idea of assisting one another in addressing several economic, political, social and technologi cal problems. Consequently, I use China's medical aid in Tanzania to examine the manifestations of the So uthern solidarity agenda , considering the fact 48 For detailed information read Helen Tilley, Africa as a Living Laboratory : Empire, Development, and the Problem of Scientific Knowledge, 1870-1950 (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2011). 49 Comaroff and Comaroff, \"Theory from the South,\" 126. 50 Julius Nyerere, \"The Meaning of \"Development\" and of \"The South\",\" and South-South , ed. The Mwalimu Nyerere Foundation (Dar es Salaam: Oxford University Press (T), 2011), 91-92; Comaroff and Comaroff, \"Theory from the South,\" 127. 16 that China was among the leading architects and sponsors of Afro-Asian movements and organisations. A \"Southern\" perspective goes beyond a parochial analysis of Marxist and neo- Marxist thinkers who vi ew low-income countries as dependent upon high-income nations for markets, capital equipment, consumption of good s and financing. Against this backdrop they premised that the underdevelopment of the South was caused by such \"unbalanced\" economic and political relationships with high-income count ries of the North. In their view, the only way for Southern countries to di sentangle such \"exploitative\" relationships was through severing their economic and political ties with countries of the North.51 With respect to \"aid\", for instance, the dominant percep tion has been that the only \"donors\" were Euro-American countries and multilateral financial institutions like the IMF and the World Bank - despite the strong engagement of several Southern countries such as China, India, and Cuba. Consequently, neo-Marxist theo ry can be somewhat limiting by overlooking the possibility that some countries in the \"perip hery\" provided ai d to \"peripheral\" and \"core\" countries. Secondly, it leaves unanswered the question of what happens when a so-called peripheral country provides aid to other peri pheral countries and whether this type of aid would also count as an example of expl oitation. China's medical assistance to post-colonial Tanzania was an attempt of the \"poor\" helping the \"poor\"; capital and e xperiences flowed from the South to the South. While this study draws from Southern Th eory, in order to overcome shortcomings, it avoids a celebratory account by critically i nquiring into the process through which SSC was instituted, the usefulness of th e knowledge produced and circulate d, and the benefits reaped by which stakeholder. As this study is concerned with health as a question of state responsibility and intervention, I make use of Foucault's notion of biopower, which he de fined as \"the set of mechanisms through which the basic biological features of the human species became the object of a political strategy, of a general strategy of power.\" 52 In this regard, the basic functions 51 Read, for instance, Carol Lancaster, Aid to Africa: So Much to Do, So Little Done (London: University of Chicago Press, 1999); William Easterly, The Whiteman's Burden: Why the West' s Efforts to Aid the Rest Have Done So Much Ill and So Little Good (New York: The Penguin Press, 2006); Dambisa Moyo, Dead Aid: Why Aid Is not Working and How There Is a Better Way for Africa (New York, NY: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2009); Sebastian Edwards, Toxic Aid: Economic Collaps e and Recovery in Tanzania (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014). 52 The term \"biopolitics\" was firstly coined and used by Swedish scholar Rudolph Kjellen in the 1900s and developed further by the French philosopher and social theo rist Michel Foucault. It was developed in a series of Foucault lectures given at the College de France from 1975 to 76; see, Antonio Campillo, \"Biopolitics, 17 of biopower were to improve the life of the population, prolong its duration, improve its chances, avoid or reduce biological accidents, and compensate for failings. These basic functions require that the state hold power over the lives of the population, perceiving the population as both biological and po litical, thus justif ies the reasons for the direct states' interventions on the lives of the population. 53 Like other \"biopolitical\" modern states, the independent Tanzanian government was interested in sustaining a heal thy population to suppl y labour, ensure prod uction, and generate wealth for the nation.54 The government of Tanzania percei ved diseases and other afflictions as both political and economic burdens. Thus, similar to other nations, Tanzania had a regulatory apparatus that was supposed to pr omote birth rate, and prevent idleness and vagrancy to ensure that th e population works appropriately. 55 Already the colonial state employed biopolitical approaches to ensure e ffective production in then Tanganyika. It made several interventions to protec t and maintain the physical wellb eing of labourers and settlers and passed several public health laws to update health standards. The goal was for African subjects to respond positively to colonial ec onomic investments since the state hoped healthy labourers would be more productive.56 The political system of the post-coloni al Tanzanian government was centred upon biopower. Soon after its politic al independence in 1961, Nyerer e named diseases among the \"enemies\" of development. Others included \"poverty\" and \"ignorance\".57 Nyerere's government, therefore, vowed to fight diseases to improve peoples' health and bring national development. In 1967, following the launch of th e Arusha Declaration, the government adopted a socialist path and subsequently made seve ral attempts to improve the wellbeing of the Totalitarianism, and Globalization,\" in Agnes Heller and Hannah Arendt: A Dialogue , ed.

Nyerere's Foreword in David F. Clyde, History of the Medical Services of Tanganyika (Dar es Salaam: Government Press, 1962), I. 18 population. Concurrently, his govern ment categorically stated in the manifesto that \"people\" were a prerequisite for devel opment. The Declaration stated: \"The development of a country is brought about by people, not by money. Money, a nd the wealth it represents, is the result and not the basis of development. The four prer equisites of development are different; they are (i) People; (ii) Land; (iii) Good Policies; (iv) Good Leadership.\"58 Therefore, Nyerere, a pro- natalist, perceived a healthy popula tion as a source of wealth and an object of surveillance of the state, and his regime regulated several elem ents to ensure their good health, longevity and productivity. I use Foucault's notion of bi opolitics to study several atte mpts undertaken by the post- colonial Tanzanian government under the Chin ese government's assistance to promote the wellbeing of the population. Schematically, th e government established pharmaceutical industries to enhance local productio n of medicines, extend health services to rural areas where the majority of people dwelled, introduced free h ealth care to ensure th at all people got access to health care, boosted medical personnel to e nhance the delivery of health services and promoted several preventive health care campai gns to contain the emergence and spread of diseases. The government aimed to improve peoples' lives, control mortality, boost reproduction, increase life expectancy, and creat e a healthy labour force capable of engaging effectively in production activities vital for economic development and Tanzania's \"nation- building\" agenda. 4. Methodological Opportunities and Challenges While researching Sino-African relationships, George T. Yu wrote: \"[. . .] studying China in Africa is much like pursuing a dragon in the bush. The dragon is imposing but the bush is dense.\" 59 Although Yu came to this conclusion in 1968, it is still relevant today. During my research, I encountered several opportunities but also challenges, not least because China's aid was executed with a high degree of conf identiality. Identification of and access to both archival and oral historical testimonies require d more time and patience than I had initially anticipated (see below). This study is primarily qualitative in nature, dr awing from both written and oral sources. Data was gathered during the c ourse of two long resear ch trips conducted in 58 Julius K. Nyerere, Ujamaa: Essays on Socialism (Dar es Salaam: Oxford Univ ersity Press, 1968), 28-29. 59 George T. Yu, \"Dragon in the Bush: Peking's Presence in Africa,\" Asian Survey 8, no. 12 (Dec. 1968): 1025- 1026. 19 Tanzania and China from January to July 2018 fo r the first phase and February to July 2019 for the second phase. I further used oral histor ical narratives, which I gathered in March 2016 when I first met Chinese medical doctors w ho worked in Tanzania during the 1990s and 2000s.60 Their written and oral histor ical narratives complement ea ch other to bring a history of China's medical assistance in post-colonial Tanzania. My interview partners included medi cal workers, government officials, pharmaceutical technicians, and patients. Such diversity complicated the collection of historical narratives, as I interviewed respondent s from different institutio ns and places. At the same time, it allowed me to meet respondents with different backgrounds and specialities who offered a variety of memories and narratives. In formants were first identified through the heads of departments from different re levant institutions from which China's medical aid was sourced and received. The heads of the de partments introduced me to the senior employees who worked in/with the project funded by the Chinese government. I interviewed five groups of respondents. Firstly, former members of Ch inese medical teams (CMTs) from Shandong province who worked in Tanzania provided insights into the CMTs' history, the ways in which the teams operated their medical services, an d how they introduced and exchanged medical knowledge with local medical workers. I also inquired about challe nges and achievements experienced, differences compared with wester n and Soviet medical workers, responses by Tanzanians, as well as the Chinese medical workers' perceptions of Tanzan ia's public health system. Initially, I anticipated that it would be difficult locating and talking to Chinese doctors who worked in Tanzania, but the Shandong Provi nce Health Bureau connected me with both retired and on-service medical doctors who worked in Tanzania from the 1970s to 2000s.61 Given the nature of the study and current critique s regarding China's engagement with African countries, the Chinese medical doctors were hesi tant to respond to so me sensitive questions inquiring about China's benefits from its medical missions in the continent. The doctors were also not ready to talk about th e opportunities and privileges they received from the Tanzanian government. Instead, they were more willing to ta lk about the challenges they experienced and how they endured compared to other medical do ctors from the North who were also working 60 I first met the CMTs in Jinan City at the moment wh en I was pursuing my second master's at Zhejiang University. 61 With the assistance from the Institute of China Studie s (ICS) of Zhejiang University (ZJU) and the Department of History of the East China Normal University (ECN U), I contacted the Health Bureau, which connected me with the doctors, and I interviewed them at Jinan City in March 2016 and May 2019. 20 in Tanzania. However, interviews with medical doctors and health offici als from Tanzania (as well as archival information from Tanzania National Archives and Shandong Provincial Archives) provided answers to some more sens itive questions. While I interviewed Chinese witnesses in English, the Chinese doctors neither spoke English nor Kiswahili fluently, so an interpreter did all the transcriptions of the interviews for me. Secondly, I interviewed former and current employees in pharmaceutical industries sponsored by the Chinese government. I inquire d about how the industries were established, their goals, where employees at tained their skills, the type s of medical products produced, sources of pharmaceutical raw materials for the i ndustries, and the contribution of the industries to the nation-building agenda of self-sufficien cy. Locating and talking to workers within the pharmaceutical industries were challenging since the Mabibo Vaccine Institute collapsed in 1986, and its workers were re-allocated to different departments. Thus, they could not be easily found for interviews. Similarly, the Keko Pharm aceutical Industries were privatised in 1997, when more than 95% of its employees were replaced. Up to the present, only one former employee works at Keko while the rest are new with less knowledge about the history of the company. I managed to interview one other form er employee who worked with KPI from 1984 to 1997, as well as the former Mini ster for Industries, each of wh om had useful narratives about the industries. Furthermore, archival informa tion and newspaper articles complemented oral historical narratives. Thirdly, I collected information from pa tients who consulted the CMTs and TCM doctors in the Dar es Salaam Region. These pe ople provided information on their perceptions of the new medical knowledge and medical serv ices offered by Chinese doctors. Generally, interviews with patients were the most sensitiv e aspect of my oral hi story work. For instance, it was difficult to locate patients treated by the CMTs, especially HIV/AIDS patients, given the prevailing stigma attached to affected persons in the community. Furthermore, many patients who attended the TCM clinic passed away, and th e clinic collapsed in 2010. However, a retired local medical officer who worked at the cl inic from 1987 to 2010 introduced me to one HIV/AIDS patient who had attended the clinic from 1990 to 2010. This patient was cooperative and responded openly to all of my research questions. Further perceptions re garding the clinical services offered by the CMTs were drawn from newspapers and archives, thus complementing the oral historical narratives. 21 The fourth group of informants were medi cal personnel in the hos pitals where CMTs worked. I inquired about the practice of S outh-South knowledge produc tion and circulation, the Chinese doctor-patient relationships, patients' satisfaction with the clinical services by the Chinese doctors, the language proficiency of Chinese medical doctors and their general perceptions of the medi cal knowledge and ability of Chinese medical doctors. Locating local medical workers who worked with the CMTs from the 1970s to 1990s was challenging.62 Thus, I interviewed medical workers who worked with Chinese doctors during the 2000s. Overall, they provided a clear understand ing of the activities of Chines e doctors in Tanzania. Another challenge was the readiness of informants to spend a long time in discussions. Medical workers were busy with lots of patients' appointments, and they were not available to be interviewed during their time off since many also worked pa rt-time in nearby private hospitals. Detailed information about the activities of Chinese doct ors in Tanzania gathered in archives of Tanzania and China complemented oral te stimonies given by local medical workers. Lastly, I consulted retired and in-service offi cials from Tanzania's Ministry of Health whom I asked about major health projects th rough which the Chinese government supported the development of the health sector in the c ountry. These government officials were open to narrating the history of Chinese medical aid in the country. Ho wever, they were relatively hesitant to comment on the drawbacks of the fu nded projects, which resulted in hindering its sustainability. Moreover, some officials were not willing to participate in the interviews and gave no significant reasons.63 Despite the challenges, information about health projects funded by the Chinese government was obtained from ar chives both in China and Tanzania. At the end of the fieldwork, I had collected a total of 37 interviews, which were held at hospitals, government offices, coffee huts, and in the residences of some respondents. A major part of my primary sources is writ ten documents, gathered from archives and libraries in Tanzania, Switzerla nd, and China. In the Tanzania National Archives (TNA), I consulted files containing annual reports from the Ministry of Health (MoH) and reports about the activities of the CMTs in Tanzania. In addition, I accessed letters exchanged between the CMTs and the MoH; as well as between the Chinese government and the MoH covering the period from 1968 to 1977. Simila r reports and letters covering the period from the 1980s to 62 Many of them have retired, and others were transferred to other hospitals which could not easily be located. 63 In one case, a former Minister for Health gave an excuse five times. A day or a few hours before the meeting, he called back regretting that he would not be available and proposed the other dates, which also he regretted. 22 1990s could not be found. However, the availabl e information was rich enough to reconstruct the history of the CMTs in Tanzania. It was eas y to understand, for inst ance, places where the CMTs were distributed, challenges they enc ountered, and the way the MoH responded to the needs of the CMTs, the roles of the CMTs in medical knowledge exchange; and the perceptions of the activities of the CMTs by patients, political elites and medical officers from the MoH. Furthermore, at the TNA, I accessed file s containing essential details about the Chinese-funded pharmaceutical industries in Ta nzania. The files cont ained production reports, demands for pharmaceutical raw materials and le tters exchanged between the management of the industries and the Ministries of Health and Industries cove ring the period from 1968 to 1990.64 The available sources helped me understand the kind of sponsorship that the Chinese government provided, the types of medical products produced by the industries, sources of pharmaceutical raw materials; challenges encountered by the industries, forces behind their establishment, the modus operandi for the pharmaceutical knowledge production and exchange, and the reason s behind their decline. In the Dodoma National Records Centre (N RC), I consulted files containing letters exchanged between the MoH and the CMTs, memo randa of understanding and reports for the Chinese-funded HIV/AIDS research, and treatme nt project covering th e period from 2000 to 2010. The information obtained shed light on the ways in which the HIV/AIDS project was conceived and developed, and how it declined. Moreover, I analys ed reports on the practice of the socialist health system and other relevant government reports. In the Zanzibar National Archives (ZNA), I read letters exchanged betwee n the CMTs and the MoH, as well as reports about Chinese medical teams in Zanzibar. While in Mbeya Records Centre (MRC), I consulted reports and documents concerning the socialist h ealth system as well as activities of Chinese medical doctors in the Mbeya Region. This info rmation was useful in tracing the emergence, development and practice of the socialist health system which came into existence after the Arusha Declaration of 1967. It wa s easy to examine how rural he alth care was executed and how the Chinese government influenced its prac tice in Tanzania. The re ports further provided details about the forces behind the decline of th e socialist health syst em and how cost-sharing in the health sect or was conceived. 64 Information about the Keko plant was dens e while a little was foun d for Mabibo vaccine. 23 In Geneva, I consulted hea lth-related files at the WHO Archives (WHOA). I read several resolutions by the World Health Assembly (WHA), reports on activities of the Global Programme on AIDS (GPA), and reports on the WHO's campaign against smallpox and tuberculosis in Tanzania. These reports supplem ented oral and archival information collected in China and Tanzania. Likewise , in China, I consulted the Sh andong Provincial Archive (SPA) and accessed CMTs' mid-year and annual reports, as well as letters exchanged between the CMTs and the Shandong Health Bureau, and between the Health Bureau and the central government of China. I also read documents by th e CMTs narrating their activities in Tanzania. Reports about the activities of the CMTs in Tan zania were dense, and th ey covered the period from 1968 to 1990. The reports supplemented ar chival information from the 1980s and 1990s, which could not be found in Tanzania. The reports and letters helped me examine forces behind China's medical assistance to Tanzania, chal lenges encountered by the CMTs, the way the provincial and central governme nt responded to the demands by the CMTs, roles played by the CMTs in promoting South-South knowledge pr oduction, circulation, and exchange, the continuities and change of the pr ogram and activities of the CMTs in Tanzania, as well as roles played by TCM experts in introducing and spreading TC M knowledge in post-colonial Tanzania. Most of the reports and letters were handwritten, and all of them were in Chinese. To address the language barrier, I hired two resear ch assistants who were fluent in the English and Chinese languages. The assistants translat ed the selected report s and letters for me. However, I was denied access to some reports, di aries, and letters that were perceived as confidential by the custodians. 65 Generally, information gathered at SPA enriched the histories about the CMTs and TCM in Tanzania. Newspapers, government reports, parliame ntary proceedings, and relevant grey literature were gathered at the University of Da r es Salaam Main Librar y-East Africana (EAF), the Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences Library, Tanga nyika Library Services- East Africana (EAF), and libraries of the Univer sity of Basel, the Department of History and the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute. Newspaper articles, for instance, reported of people's perception of the activities of the CMTs, evaluations of the practi ce of socialist health system and articles about Tanzania's health s ituation in different hist orical periods. Grey 65 All ordered files had been carefully screened by cust odians before being allowed for perusal. Some pages deemed confidential were pi nned to restrict access. 24 literature and research work produced by postgradua te students at the University of Dar es Salaam and Muhimbili enriched my literature review and argument of the study. The general challenge of archival materials was the incompleteness of the documents I perused. Some files lacked a sequential link to one another. Such cases were much more common at TNA due to misallocation of the files. Some of the or dered files could not be found. This challenge limited a full follow-up of the activities of the CMTs, research and treatment progress at the HIV/AIDS clinic, as well as the progress of pharmaceu tical industries funded by the Chinese government. However, I was able to cover many of these gaps through the use of other sources including oral historical narratives, provincia l archives, and public record centres. 5. Structure of the Dissertation Given the nature of the study, the di ssertation proceeds thematically - focusing on specific medical projects - rather than strictly chronologically. Chapte r 1 disentangles the social and political contexts that were behind China's medical assistance to Tanzania from 1961 to 1971. It discusses the reasons why the Ta nzanian government forged close relations with socialist countries from the mid-1960s, and why it adopted a socialist health system in 1967. Furthermore, the chapter shows that inad equacies in Tanzania's health sector necessitated the country's search for medical assistance. As a member of the Afro-Asian Peoples' Solidarity Organisation (AAPSO), Tanzania qualified for economic, political, social, and technological assistance from other Southern countries. Also, diploma tic rifts between the Tanzanian government and countries of the Nort h such as Western Germany, Britain, and the USA during the mid-1960s, made the government turn to China and the Soviet Union for economic, political, social and technological as sistance. Moreover, th e chapter shows that China's struggle over diplomatic recognition against Taiwan in the UNGA influenced its assistance to the South to win allies. Chapter 2 discusses the emergence and practices of socialist health policies in Tanzania from 1967 to 1990, showing that the Ta nzanian government benefited from Southern solidarity by learning and adopting health policies from other \"peripheral\" countries. Health policies that were initially practi sed in China, such as free health care, rural health care, and the institutionalisation of traditional medicine, were similarly implemented by the Tanzanian government soon after the endorsement of the Ar usha Declaration in 1967. Nevertheless, this 25 chapter also shows that the po licies adopted from China were affected by several colonial legacies. For instance, the rural health care pr ogram benefited from experiences of both the colonial administration and Chinese govern ment. Thus, the post-colonial Tanzanian government manipulated both colonial and Chinese health policies to make them fit into its social, economic, and political contexts. This chapter maintains that the spread and adoption of China's health polic ies by some Southern countries show that development policy did not only flow from the \"core\" to the \"periphery\", but they were also communicated between supposed peripheral nations. Chapter 3 studies concrete projects funded by the Chinese government in Tanzania. It examines the emergence and development of Chin ese medical teams (CMTs) in Tanzania from 1968 to 2010. This chapter shows that Africa was the first fron tier for the Chinese government to exercise medical assistance before extending it to other countries of the Global South. It depicts the changes and continuities of China's foreign policy and its implications for the CMT program. Furthermore, the chapter analyses th e roles played by the Chinese government in capacity building for Tanzania's health sector through training of local medical workers and attending patients. I argue in this chapter th at the CMT program was a humanitarian mission but at the same time driven by political and ec onomic calculations. The program acted as a soft way of securing allies during the Cold War era a nd a vital tool in maintaining China's political and economic interests in Afri ca. Additionally, the ways in which the CMT program was executed only marginally promoted sustainabilit y and self-dependency in Tanzania's health sector. The fourth chapter shows that China's medi cal assistance to Tan zania promoted the spread of China's traditional medical knowle dge. The chapter establishes how traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) was introduced, percei ved, practised, and developed in post-colonial Tanzania. While TCM was first introduced to th e coast of East Africa by Chinese navigators as early as the 15 th century, its development only gained momentum in 1968, when China dispatched its first batch of TC M-trained medical teams to Tanzania. Furthermore, this chapter shows that HIV/AIDS-related TCM research and treatment, as well as China's anti-malaria program further influenced the acceptance and pract ice of TCM in the country. I argue in this chapter that the practice, spread, and acceptance of TCM knowledge to Tanzania were imperative for the promotion of medical knowle dge from the South. The Southern countries perceived \"South-South knowledge exchange\" as an emancipatory undertaking against the dominance of \"Northern\" or \"Western\" biomedicine. Nevertheless, di scussions in this chapter 26 show that the good intentions of South-Sout h knowledge exchange could not successfully replace the dominance of medical knowledge from the North. Chapter 5 discusses the emergence and development of Chinese-funded pharmaceutical industries in post-colonial Tan zania, and retraces their implications for Tanzania's health sector. In order to dis cern the extent to which the Chinese-funded pharmaceutical industries distinguished themselves from their predecessors, this chapter also includes a brief examination of colonial pharmaceu tical industries in th e Tanganyika territory. The chapter further discusses how pharmaceutical knowledge was communicated between Chinese and Tanzanian technicians in the cont ext of South-South knowledge exchange and its implications in the development of pharmaceutical industries in Tanzania. I argue that Chinese- funded pharmaceutical industries were conceived unde r several constraints that hampered their operation and sustainability. Such circumst ances intensified Tan zania's dependence on imported raw materials and foreign technica l experts to sustain the factories. The conclusion assesses the consistency and inconsistency of China's medical assistance to Tanzania's nation-building and sel f-reliance agendas. The findings of this study show that although the Tanzanian government an ticipated that medical aid from China would distinctively promote the country's self-reliance agenda, the ways in which such assistance was provided failed to realise those hopes. 27 CHAPTER ONE: DISENTANGLING THE CO NTEXTS FOR CHINA'S MEDICAL ASSISTANCE TO TANZANIA, 1961-1971 1.1 Introduction Several scholars have associated China's assistance to Tanzania and other African countries with Cold War politics. They uphol d that the assistance aimed to enhance Sino- Tanzanian diplomatic relationship and turn the co untry's political elites , a vanguard for China's quest for diplomatic recognition in the UN Assembly.1 This chapter contributes to the preceding claim and examines other discourses th at gave birth to China's assistance to Tanzania. It shows that the crisis of the Tanzanian health sector and the government's commitment to the health of the population were decisive influences on medical assistance. Indeed, at independence, the Tanzanian governme nt lacked sufficient medical personnel, had limited distribution within the healthcare infras tructure, and carried a disease burden too heavy for a young nation. On the other hand, the Chin ese government executed its aid under the influence of Southern solidarity agendas set by various Afro-Asian mo vements. Chinese aid arrived timely as it was provi ded when the Tanzanian government had quarrelled with traditional donors of the North. As a result, th e Northern donors such as West Germany, the United Kingdom, and the US withheld all form s of assistance, including medical aid. This chapter further offers a brief background to Si no-Tanzanian relationships and shows how they influenced China's assistance. I argue that Tanzania's diplomatic, economic, and social predicaments of the mid-1960s were fundamental motivations for its reliance on China's aid. I use this as a backdrop to the emergence of Chinese medical teams and other health-related projects discussed in subsequent chapters. 1 The Tanzania-Zambia Railway (TAZARA) project manifest ed China's struggle with the alleged US imperialism and Soviet revisionism in Africa. Indeed, China's commitm ent to the project won the country sympathy and turned political elites in Tanzania and Zambia vanguard to China's bid for the admission to the UN Assembly.

The number of qualified medical personnel such as doctors, nurses, and midwiv es did not keep pace with th e soaring population and social demands. In 1962, the World Health Organiza tion (WHO) reported that 26 independent African countries had a total of about 4,700 doc tors (Africans and non-Africans). With this number, a single doctor would ha ve had to attend approxim ately 18,000 people. However, by 1965, the continent's growing population complicated further initiatives to address the shortage of trained medical personnel. The doctor-patie nt ratio rose to one doctor for every 20,500 people. Above all, there were very few Af rican (indigenous) doctors. The WHO report shows that in 1965, 26 independent Afri can countries had approximately 1,700 African doctors. Given such a figure, with the absence of expatriates, the doctor-patien t ratio would be one doctor for every 50,000 people. Regrettably, so me independent African states had no African doctors at all, and others had the ratio of one African doctor for every million people.2 Health challenges in most African countries were thus to be tack led by establishing a ramified system of medical institutions to train medical personnel and combat the emergence and spread of diseases. Thus, the countries needed prompt medical assistan ce to build up their capacity through training and foreign expatriates to work w ith the few medical personnel. The situation was not different in Tanzania since, at independence, the country only had about 549 registered medical doctors, of which 400 were residents, serving 10.4 million population. Many of the registered resident docto rs were Indians, while Africans numbered only twelve. 3 The workforce deficit in the health sect or was also the case for the low level of medical personnel. At independe nce, the government had about 200 African medical assistants and less than 1,000 low-level health care personnel who were task ed with serving 98 hospitals, 22 rural health centres, and 975 village dispensaries.4 With such inadequacies, health care provisions were obviously problematic. As a result, the infant mortality rate was about 200 to 2 \"Paucity of Doctors and Nurses,\" Ghanaian Times , May 14-20, 3 Richard M. Titmuss, Brian Abel-Smith, George Macd onald, Arthur W.

The low number of trained medical personnel in Tanzania can be traced back to the fact that the German and British colonial au thorities did not open a medical college in the territory, but only a few medical training centres that trai ned lower medical cadres. This situation was the outcome of an explicit coloni al policy. The Colonial Secretary, Malcolm Macdonald, asserted: \"Admission [in Britain] to the unified colonial medical service is necessarily confined, broadly speaking, to pe rsons of British nationality, though a person who is born or who is ordinarily resident in a co lony, protectorate, or ma ndated territory, is not excluded; however, it is the pol icy to train the local inhabitant s for minor posts in the health service.\"6 Amon Nsekela and Aloysius Nhonoli note that throughout British colonial governance, no Tanganyikan was admitted for a Doct or of Medicine (MD) course in Britain.7 Makerere College started in 1922 in the neighbouring colony of Uganda, opened its doors to students from Kenya, Tanganyika, an d Zanzibar in the mid-1930s when it became East African College. Nevertheless, its annual intake was limite d to nine students, so that competition for admission was fierce. As a result, up to the end of 1952, only ten Tanganyikan doctors graduated from Makerere, and only fourteen were in government service by the end of 1960.8 The other cause of shortage in medical pe rsonnel of African orig in was the colonial education system, which racially discrimina ted Africans throughout the colonial period. The system was three-tiered, dividing Africans, Asians, and Europeans. Africans dominated enrolment at the primary level, while Asians and Europeans dominated the secondary and college levels. For example, in 1960, half of the budget for the Ministry of Education was spent on European and Asian students who constituted less than 2% of th e total population. Only one-quarter of the total populati on of school-going age were enrolled in primary schools, and 5 Nyerere, Freedom and Development , 294. 6 Quoted in Amon J. Nsekela and Aloysius M.

This lack of adequately skilled personne l compelled the post-colonial Tanzanian government to rely on expatria tes to carry out skilled prof essional and managerial jobs. Nevertheless, in its First Fi ve-Year Development Plan (1964 -69), the government anticipated having fully qualified Tanzanians filling those posts by 1980.10 Subsequently, in 1963, the government launched the \"Africanisation Scheme\" to promote the training of local personnel and replace expatriate s with some Africans.11 The government, however, did not abstain from seeking the assistance of medical workers from abroad to build its capacity and facilitate knowledge exchange. In his speech, Nyerere contended that: It is not being self-reliant to refuse to carry out the directions of a foreign engineer, a foreign doctor, or a foreign manager; it is just being stupid. It is absolutely vital that Tanzanians should determine policy; but if the implementation of a particular policy requires someone with good educational qualifications or long experience, it is not very sensible to allow that policy to fail through pride.12 Surely, although Nyerere cherished the policy of self-reliance, he was less sceptical over the use of expatriates. He alleged that fo reign experts were vital for knowledge exchange, through which local workers would learn gradually to work independently in their absence. With such an attitude, the Tanzanian government retained foreign medi cal doctors who worked under the British colonial government to build the capacity of its health sector. However, there were not enough foreign doctors to serve the whole country. Thus, th e government recruited more medical doctors from Israel, Russia, Yugosla via, Canada, USA, Britain, and other places, to name just a few (Table 1).13 Indeed, the government perceived hiring expatriates as the only feasible solution to addressing th e urgent shortage of medical st aff.

Owing to the shortage of me dical personnel in Tanzania, which could not only be met by expatriates and graduates from abroad, the post-colonial government established medical colleges and universities. With the assistance of the Rockef eller Foundation, Basel Foundation for Aid to Developing Countries, United Na tions Development Programme (UNDP) and the WHO, the government started a Medical School ( now the Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences) at Muhimbili Hospital in Marc h 1963. The mentioned institutions assisted the school in developing curricula, books, salaries of expatriate s, equipment, fellowships, construction of buildings, teaching and training of doctors for health care posts in Tanzania, and trained nationals to assume the teaching pos ts. The nucleus of the school was the Medical Training Centre (MTC) built in 1958, conjointly with Muhimbili Hospital. The school commenced with an intake of ten students with Ordinary Le vel certificate. In 1964, it adopted the Makerere curriculum and rose the entry qua lifications to an Advanced Level certificate with at least subsidiary passes in physics, ch emistry and biology. Up to the 1970s, it was able to admit at least 30 medical students annually, and the Ministry of Health (MoH) directly 32 employed all graduates.14 With time, the school played a commendable role in building the capacity of the health sector. Nevertheless, grad uates from within and outside the country were not sufficient in number to cater to the demands of the health sector.

For instance, ten years after independence, the government recorded a slight increase of registered African medical doc tors from 12 in 1961 to 123 in 1971.15 Consequently, the demand for medical personnel remained higher du e to the increasing population and the disease burden. Under such circumstance, the health sector constantly relied on expatriates, especially 14 \"WHO, Assignment Report: Medical School, Dar es Salaam, September 1970-May 1974\"; also see \"WHO, Requests for Waiver of Application of Programme Support Costs - Training of Health Personnel - Tanzania, Funds - in - Trust, 5/12/1974,\" WHOA, File No. TAN-HMD-001, 1974-1979-HMD 5, Training of Health Personnel; \"Tenth Anniversary of Muhimbili Medical Centre,\" Daily News , August 3, 1987, 5; Charles A.

This is because we n eed every bit of energy we have to put to the task of building the nation. Building a nation is not a job to entrust to chronically sick people.16 Derek Bryceson, Minister for Health, 1963. The preceding quotation recapitulates the si gnificance of a healthy population in the post-colonial government's nation building agenda . The government anticipated that a healthy and stable nation would be built if the \"war\" against what Nyerere referred to as the \"three major enemies of development\": poverty, ignora nce, and disease, were fought successfully.17 To stress the fight against dis eases, in 1966, the Minister for Health, H. Makame, argued to change the order of priorities to disease, i gnorance, and poverty. He claimed that \"[d]iseased children cannot learn at school in order to get rid of ignorance nor can a diseased population be productive in order to get rid of poverty.\"18 Such determination aimed at building efficient \"human capital\" capable of engaging effectivel y in production, which was vital for building a powerful nation. Indeed, all strategies and mechan isms undertaken by the political authority to improve the population's wellbeing were timely, necessary and consistent with the notion of biopolitics. In line with what scholarship has observed regarding modern \"biopolitical\" states, the Tanzanian authorities perceived a \"population\" whose health was vital for it to become productive and contribute to the nation's wealth and political power. Neve rtheless, a successful fight against the mentioned \"enemies\" required intense commitment, efforts, and funds. Undeniably, the government's ambitions were di fficult to achieve for a young and low-income country. Therefore, while embarking on severa l health-related program mes (discussed below), the government also assigned ambassadors the role of seeking support from overseas countries. 16 \"A Speech by Minister for Health , Honourable D.

S. K. Tumbo, in his press conference of April 13, 1962, requested the Britis h government: \"We have declared war against poverty, ignorance, and disease, an d we wish to fight this war in our own style, but [. . .] we are short of instruments, and we look upon Br itain, the Commonwealth, and all other friendly countries in the world as allies in our struggle.\"19 Tanzania's endeavour to provide effective health care to its population re ceived massive support from numerous donors (see below). Tanzanian authorities did not c onsider the issue of health in isolation but argued that the \"three enemies\" were interdepen dent. For instance, due to \"ignorance\" of nutrition facts, people contracted nutrient-relate d diseases such as obesity, ca ncer, diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases. Consequently, nut ritional campaigns figured among crucial preventive health approaches adopted by th e post-colonial government to challenge the colonial health policies, which stressed curative measures.20 Subsequently, the government raised nutritional educational le vels described to the people in several ways. For example, nutritional education became part of the school curriculum in July 1963. Furthermore, the government took several measures to ensure th e effective production of food crops and boosted economic wellbeing to relieve \"poverty\" among its population.21 Along this line, it established the Freedom from Hunger National Committ ee in 1964, which was in charge of the coordination and planning of all aspects of food and nutrition. Add itionally, the government established nutritional departments at regional and district leve ls to evaluate the nutritional state of the population and determine reasons for any existing malnutrition. Nutritional departments were responsible for improving th e nutritional status of the population through education and other measures. At district levels, nutritional depa rtments were staffed with one nutritional officer, five nutri tion teachers, and five village nutrition assessors.22 The government united the efforts of several ministries to fight nutritional diseases. For instance, the Ministries of Health, Education, Agriculture and Community Development worked together to combat nutrient-rela ted diseases, while the Ministry of Labour ensured adequate 19 \"New High Commissioner Aims to Strengthen Friendship Between Tanganyika and Britain, April 12, 1962,\" TNA.

At the same time, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry proce ssed and imported essential foodstuffs.23 The government's focus on eradicating malnutrition, which was the most alarming challenge, had the unfortunate consequence of downplaying other nutritional diseas es mentioned earlier. Nonetheless nutritional campaigns played a commendable role in spreading nutritional education among the population.24 Nutritional campaigns were backed by the Chakula Ni Uhai (Food Is Life) programme of 1975, which attempted to respond to the que stion of what commun ities produced and ate. The programme strived to enable people to get essential foodstuff and ch ange eating habits to avoid nutritional diseases. The government encour aged peasants to pr oduce enough of several kinds of food crops to cater to the demands an d consumption levels of rural people. Several campaigns launched before the Chakula Ni Uhai such as Siasa Ni Kilimo (Politics Is Agriculture) or the Iringa Declaration of 1972 and the Kilimo cha Kufa na Kupona (Life and Death Farming) of 1974 were the vanguard to realising the nu tritional campaign.25 Through these operations, the government attempted to attain self-reliance and adequate food production. However, agricultural activities were stalled by droughts which occurred from 1973 to 74; 1981 to 82; and 1983 to 84, severely limiting the production of both food and cash crops, which forced the government to rely on imported foodstuffs.26 Furthermore, from 1973 to 78, the government launched a five-year preventive health education campaign to fight common diseases . The campaign, which was referred to as Mtu Ni Afya (Man Is Health), focused on strategies to maintain a healthy environment and individual hygiene. The campaign was largely sponsored by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) and cost more than Tshs. 1,450,000.27 It explicitly aimed to raise 23 \"Development Plan, Ministry of Health, Nutrition 9, July 1963,\" TNA.

Thus, regardle ss of their class, people were ta sked with the responsibility to contain the emergence and spr ead of several diseases. The Mtu Ni Afya campaign had much in common with preventive health campaigns carried out in other countries of the Global Sout h such as Cuba and China. In the 1950s, for instance, the Chinese government , through \"Mass Line for Health,\" attempted to prevent the occurrences and spread of common diseases such as bilharzia, tuberculosis, and venereal diseases. Accordingly, in 1952, it launched the \"Patriotic Health Movement\" which mobilised the Chinese to eradicate rats, flies, mosquitoes, and other carriers of infe ctious diseases. They also cleared garbage and litter and improved the disposal and r ecycling of human excreta, and above all, enhanced the quality of water supply.29 Subsequently, in 1966, the Tanzanian Ministry of Health sent medical delegates to study China's health system. Upon their return home, they recommended that the government a dopt several preventive health measures which they learned in China.30 Indeed, adopting preventive health programmes which were similarly implemented by some Southern countries refl ected the country's commitment to the South- South cooperation and admiration of learning from the South. Unlike the Chinese government, which used both radio and films to transmit preventive health education, the Tanzanian government mostly used radio programmes. Transmitting knowledge through radio broadcast was initially used successfully in 1969 by the Institute of Adult Education of the University of Dar es Sa laam in defining goals of the country's Second Five Year Plan. Through radio programmes, the government also communicated knowledge on the significance of the general election of 1970.

By 1970, the country's total radio audience was estimated at 8 million out of 13.6 million population.32 Therefore, there were noticea bly a good number of audiences who could get trained through radio programmes. In a compelling and entertaining manner, preventive health education spread to different groups of people through the radi o. The MoH produced about 12 half-hour radio programmes which were each broadcasted week ly and repeated twic e to enhance their understandability.33 Before the commencement of the campaign, the MoH held at different levels a whole series of seminars aimed at training 750,000 discussion group leaders who coordinated listening groups in their respective comm unities and led discussions after each session. Indeed, through radio study groups, health education was easily spread to both literate and illiterate populations. Radio campaigns were a useful means of knowledge circulation since, through 1970, more than 80% of the population were consider ed illiterate; hence, they could not conceivably attend form al health education training.34 In addition to radio programmes, photographs, books, pamphlets, line drawings, posters, and manuals written in simple Kiswahili texts were pr oduced and distributed widely. The government distributed two specially written textbooks to an estimated tw o million students and put out radio programmes to coincide with discu ssion group meetings held between May and August 1973.35 The government expected that, thr ough participation in discussion groups, reading circulated books, and listening to the radio health programs, health educa tion would swiftly spread and people would practice what they learned, have their health improved, and diseases reduced. The Mtu Ni Afya campaign targeted common dise ases which would possibly be alleviated through certai n basic health activities performe d individually or communally. Such activities included but were not limited to: drinking clean and boiled water, covering food, building and using latrines, eat ing a nutritious diet , destroying mosquito breeding sites and 31 Hall, Mtu Ni Afya , 17. 32 Budd L.

These diseases were widespread a nd cost the lives of many Tanzanians. However, prominence was given to malaria, which account ed for 10% of all hospital admissions and 7% of all deaths.37 The government was determined to reach notable achievements through health education campaigns. It, therefore, requested medical doctors from Cuba and China, whose health institutions had long practised preventive health education campaigns to spread health education in the country. In different histori cal periods, Chinese and Cubans suffered from tuberculosis, bilharzia, and ma laria. Through preventive health measures, they were able to reduce the pace of these occurrences and the ex tent of their spread. Their medical doctors dispatched to Tanzania had, therefore, enough experience and knowledge on preventive health education to share with Tanzanians.38 In this vein, in 1973, the Mini ster for Health, Ali Mwinyi, prompted Chinese medical doctors to transmit preventive health e ducation throughout the villages and hospitals where they worked, and to share transmission strategies with local medical workers.39 Information from the health depa rtment of the Shandong province shows that at different occasions, Chinese medical sta ff spread preventive health education to several villages (Figure 1).40 36 Nyerere, President's Report to the TANU Conference Resnick, Long Transition , 119; Hall, \"Revolution Rural Education,\" 137. 37 Hall, Mtu Ni Afya , 24. 38 See, for instance, Hall, 9.6.1973, Saa Tatu Asubuhi,\" TNA.

The health education campaign, howev er, was arduous since it faced several challenges including radio broadcast interruptions due to bad weather in some places, and radio networks that were yet to be installed in other places - both limiting peoples' access to the programmes. Therefore, village facilitators wh o attended health trainings were crucial in informing people with no access to radio services. Additionally, taboos among some ethnic groups hindered them from adopting certain heal th practices encouraged during the campaign. For instance, some communities held the view that \"the faeces of fathers and children, particularly those of fathers and daughters, are not mixed\". 41 Therefore, for such communities, sharing latrines with the entire family was ta boo. These and other challenges, however, did not hinder notable successes of the health campaign.

Reports from the MoH shows that it in creased the coverage of basic sanitation from 20% in 1973 to 80% in 1978.43 Several preventive health education cam paigns adopted by the post-colonial government disengaged the country from the hangove r of the colonial health policies, which favoured curative measures.44 Preventive and educative approaches empowered people with not only technical health knowledg e but also the awaren ess that they had th e power to change their lives and hence avoid overwhelming the fe w available health care infrastructures and medical personnel. The effective spread of pr eventive health education meant fewer people would seek curative health services and hence reduce the country's disease burden. Consequently, the people themselves became c onstant agents of preventive health care. However, despite peoples' efforts to maintain their health, the government intervened further to regulate and implement the or der of hygiene. Nevertheless, a ny triumphant drive to build a nation with a healthy population requires support from countries with experience and a strong economy. That is why Tanzania's government ex tended requests for me dical aid to several donor countries. All forms of assistance, however , were curtailed by Co ld War politics, which defined diplomatic relationships between donor and recipient countries. Indeed, donor countries only extended loans and grants to c ountries with mutual id eological understandings.45 As a result, Tanzania's diplomatic fracas with Western bloc nations imp acted the provisions of loans and grants negatively. This is the subject of th e next section. 1.4 Tanzania's Foreign Policy and Its Crisis, 1961-1967 Tanzania attained its political independe nce at the height of Cold War politics.

The governme nt committed to non-alignment while striving to maintain equality, freedom , justice, and dignit y. These aspects were summarised in the government's fi ve foreign-policy guidelines out lined by President Julius K. Nyerere. The guidelines included : protection of the integrity and security of the country, support for African liberation and freedom fr om racist oppression, support of the United Nations in its search for peace and justice, pr omotion of African unity, and non-alignment in ideological power struggles.46 An official statement from th e Ministry of Foreign Affairs stipulated that: We regard the present situation [the Cold War] where the world is riven into hostile ideological dissensions as being unsatisfactory. But it is not the belief of our people that the present divisions are between the good and the bad. We refuse to subscribe to the hideous proposition that one group of contenders is always wrong or that another group is always right. Our policy is to keep out of these automatic assumptions and all that is implied in them. The corollary in this policy is a feeling of friendliness to all nations in the world. 47 Indeed, the government was determined to not be dragged into th e Cold War nor to be used as a pawn in the conflict. Therefore, it remained neutral, exte nding friendship to both conflicting parties on the basis of mutual non-interference in internal affairs.48 Nevertheless, the practicality of this neutrality policy sparked a crisis in Tanzania's foreign relations during the mid-1960s. The mess grew through the unifi cation of Tanganyika and Zanzibar in 1964, which complicated the country's relationship wi th the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG). At independence, the government of Zanzibar established diploma tic relations with the German Democratic Republic (GDR), while Tanganyika main tained diplomatic relations with the FRG. According to the terms of the union, foreign affairs were a matter for the government of Tanzania. As a result, all diplomatic representa tions were to be stati oned in Dar es Salaam. This union agreement resulted in an untoward at titude from the FRG, in particular, which demanded sole representation to the exclusion of the GDR. 49 46 Paul Bjerk, Building a Peaceful Nation: Julius Nyerere and the Establishment of Sovereignty in Tanzania, 1960- 1964 (New York: University of Roches ter Press, 2015), 184; C.

It threatened to withhold scheduled aid and withdraw already released assistance to the country. Despite all the mentioned intimidations, the government of Tanzania permitted the GDR to esta blish a Consulate General in Dar es Salaam. Subsequently, the FRG withdrew its military aid starting with taking home its fifty servicemen. Nyerere responded by terminating all aid fort hwith from the FRG worth USD 32.5 million, informing the FRG Ambassador, Dr Herbert Schroede r, that on principle, he was not prepared to compromise the conditions under which Tanzan ia received overseas aid. He further charged that the FRG sought to tu rn the Tanzanian government into its puppet via aid.50 Nyerere's uncompromising stand was hailed by several groups of Tanzanians as well as representatives of liberation movements who assembled in Nair obi for the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) conference. Indeed, the FRG's dictates propelled Tanzania's m ove to self-reliance campaigns (see below).51 Under threats from the FRG, Nyerer e's regime had to decide whether to maintain its relationship with the FRG and forgo the union government or vice versa. Nyerere's regime chose the union government, wh ich, in turn, put an end to all kinds of assistance from the FRG and its allies. Howeve r, although the decision to allow both FRG and Einheit) of 1990, the FRG distinguished itself as a legitimate government of Germany and any state which recognised GDR was no longer a friend of the Bonn regi me. Consequently, it channelled its aid to countries which did not forge diplomatic relationships with the GDR. This posture was consistent with the \"Hallstein Doctrine\" which overtly threatened to cancel diplomatic relations with countries which would recognise what so-called the Soviet Occupation Zone (Sowjetische Besatzungszone); see, for instance, Guido Magome, \"Self-Reliance Makes Stronger and Faster Pace,\" Daily News , February 1, 1978, 5-6; Kapepwa I.

For instance, Tanzanians pursuing health-related courses in seve ral medical colleges under Bonn government scholarships had to return home where the govern ment pledged to find alternative colleges and universities to enable them to complete their studies.53 While the Tanzanian government refused to succumb to FRG's dictates, it simulta neously sustained a clos e relationship with the GDR. As a result, it localised Cold War politics in the country as the two conflicting powers had their homes in Dar es Salaam, each trying to show its supremacy ove r the other. All these incidents happened in 1964, a few years after Tan zania's political independence. It was a period when the country had neither declared an id eology nor was its economy strong enough to forgo external aid. Furthermore, in 1965, another capitalist pow er, Britain, similarly entered diplomatic disputes with the Tanzanian government. The Tanzanian campaign for the decolonisation of the Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) partly influenced the collapse of their bonds. Under its Unilateral Declaration of Independence ( UDI), a minority declared independence in Zimbabwe. This incidence sparked anger in some African countries, including Tanzania, which openly criticised the UDI. This diplomatic rift, however, was somewhat different from the rift between the FRG - which was a bilateral incident invol ving Bonn and Dar es Salaam. The UDI case was multilateral since the OAU was the va nguard for action. Towards the end of 1965, the OAU wanted the British government to resume constitutional responsibility for Southern Rhodesia and bring down Smith's regime. OAU members threatened to sever their diplomatic relations with Britain if it did not meet their demands.54 The voices by these OAU members, however, were not impactful since the Britis h government did not take action against the Smith's regime. In response to the OAU declara tions, Tanzania was one of the first nine African countries to sever diplomatic ties wi th Britain. As a result , all London-aid to the country halted. The health sector was severely hu rt by the crisis since all medical workers from 52 \"Politics, Decolonization, and the Co ld War in Dar Makes Stronger and Faster Pace,\" 5-6. 44 Britain working in the country depa rted immediately after the dispute.55 FRG's and Britain's withholding all assistance to the government of Tan zania affected the country's economic and social sectors. Yet, the government did not yiel d in to economic and diplomatic pressures from Bonn and London. Instead, it promoted \"self-help schemes\" and prepared citizens to espouse the policies of socialism and se lf-reliance officially adopted in 1967. Indeed, these diplomatic rifts did not only prompt the Tanzanian governme nt to turn to Beijing and other socialist countries for economic, social, a nd technological assistance but they also made it cautious of accepting foreign aid as discussed at length in the next section. 1.5 Self-Reliance Agenda and Tanzan ia's Perception and Paradox of Foreign Aid Aid giving has a very long history. Howe ver, it became robust in 1947 following the proposal by the US Foreign Mini ster, George C. Marshall. Th e main motive of his proposal was to reconstruct the seve rely wounded economies of the European countries which participated in the Second World War. The Marshall Plan was eventu ally realised in 1948.56 The Plan was followed by the Bretton Woods Institutions (BWIs) which similarly focused on rescuing the economy of European countries after the War. At its prelim inary stage, countries of the Global South did not rece ive any assistance from the BWIs even though they were also affected by the War. However, the Cold War po litics that followed informed the lack of aid provisions to the South. Later, loans and aid we re not only offered for development projects but also for supporting countries fighting for independence and nation- building. For instance, in the 1950s, the US President, Harry S. Truman , advocated assistance to Southern countries, with a focus on states that were in the anteroom of communism . Thus, South Korea and Taiwan became the earliest countries to benefit from US aid. 57 Indeed, Cold War politics defined economic, political, social, and technological assi stance to the South. While US aid aimed at halting the spread of communi sm, Soviet assistance focused on subverting the extension of capitalism. 55 Resnick, The Long Transition , 57; Magome, \"Self-Reliance Makes Stronger and Iliffe, East African Doctors: A Hist ory of the Modern Profession , (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998), 200. 56 David Sogge, Give and Take: What's the Matter with Foreign Aid?

The Declar ation denounced foreign aid as principal and effective means to realise economic development and nation-building. The government perceived grants as a driving force to dependence. Under the Declaration, the government was determined to shift the nation from aid-depend ency to self-dependency. Underscoring this Nyerere contended: [. . .] it is even more stupid, for us to imagine that we shall rid ourselves of our poverty through foreign financial assistance rather than our own financial resources [. . . .] there is no country in the world which is prepared to give us gifts or loans, or establish industries, to the extent that we would be able to achieve all our development targets [. . . .] even if it were possible [. . .] is this what we really want? Independence means self-r eliance. Independence cannot be real if a nation depends upon gifts and loans from another for its development. Even if there was a nation, or nations, prepared to give us all the money we need for our development, it would be improper for us to accept such assistance without asking ourselves how this would affect our independence and our very survival as a nation. 58 Nyerere realised the duality inherent to potential prospects and dangers from loans and grants: the former being essential for the country's development, and the latter being a danger to that nation's sovereignty because he w ho pays the piper calls the tune. In this vein, the Declaration did not denounce aid and loans a ltogether. Instead, the government vowed to receive foreign assistance whic h promised to help the country move through a transition towards self-reliance.59 In abstract, Nyerere's regime was not ready to relinquish its sovereignty to the donors by accepting grants. Neve rtheless, his government was less sceptical over foreign loans. The D eclaration avowed that: It is true that loans are better than \"free\" gifts. A loan is intended to increase our efforts or make those [efforts more] fruitful. But even loans have their limitations. You have to give consideration to the ability to repay. To burden the people with big loans, the repayment of which will be beyond their means, is not to help them but to make them suffer. It is even worse when the loans they are asked to repay have not benefited the majority of the people but have only benefited a small minority. 60 58 Julius K.

The country's dependence upon foreign aid and loans was not meaningfully reduced after the Arusha Declaration due to hurdles it encountered restructuring the economy. As a result, from the mid-1960s through the 1970s, foreign assistance became the lifeline of Nyerere's government, and the country was the wo rld's leading recipient of loans and grants. Rwekaza Mukandala writes that under this se lf-reliance paradigm, the government became \"more like a shameless beggar.\"61 Nevertheless, most of its lo ans and aid were sourced from China and Nordic countries which Nyerere percei ved as \"comrade in arms\". Nyerere supposed that, unlike the US and other im perialist donors, assistance from China and Nordic countries was consistent with the country's self-relian ce agenda and would not meddle in internal affairs.62 Nevertheless, the manner in which Nordic and Chinese assistance was executed surely did not help the country become self-reliant.63 China and the Nordic countries provided loans and grants to Nyerere's government despite critiques from the US and other trad itional donors of the North. Instead, they were inspired by Nyerere's development endeavour, especially the self-reliance agenda, which paralleled their foreign aid policies. Sweden a nd China, for instance, sh ared socialist ideology with Nyerere's government. Thus, they had high confidence in Tanz ania's authority. Such trust influenced them to assist the country while honouring Nyerere's priorities, the act which Ole Elgstorm calls \"aid on recipient's terms\".64 Foreign aid and loans from China and Nordic countries from the mid-1960s to 80s contributed to several econo mic and social projects such as roads, rails, agriculture, water and electricity production and supply, as well as health infrastructures. One such memorable projec t financed by the Chinese government was the construction of the Tanzania-Zambia Railway (T AZARA), a project whic h had been dismissed by funders from the North.65 The Chinese government's commitments to the railway and other 61 Rwekaza Mukandala, \"From Proud Defiance to Beggary: A Recipient's Tale,\" in Agencies in Foreign Aid: Comparing China, Sweden and the United States in Tanzania , eds.

In a speech delivered to the handing over of the TAZARA he contended: I used to be endlessly pestered with unsolicited warnings and advice about the dangers of accepting Chinese cooperation. When it became abundantly clear even to the worst detractors of China and the greatest enemies of African freedom and development that China had no imperialist ambitions in Africa, another question was raised. And the question was: \"Why is China, a Third World co untry, being so correct and so generous in dealing with the poor?\" My answer to this rephrased suspicion of China is \"Ask the leaders of the super-rich countries why they are often so arrogant and so mean in their dealing with the nations of the Third World?67 Nyerere perceived loans and aid from Northe rn donors as imperialistic in nature and less promising to turn recipient countries sel f-reliant. In contrast, he perceived China's assistance as worthy and friendly to development.68 His perceptions represented the aspirations of many African polit ical elites who resented the economic and political strings attached to foreign loans and aid, aiming for maximum assi stance and minimum interference. The Chinese government realised the wishes of African leaders and won the trust of their governments by relaxing conditions attached to loans and gran ts deployed to the continent. Indeed, the perception of African leaders over loans and gr ants was that, unlike traditional donors of the North, the Nordic countries, China, and other donors of the South aide d Southern countries altruistically. Such percepti ons, however, were uncertain. However, assistance and general trust of Western governments in Nyerere waned in the late 1970s. In 1978, the Chinese government underwent reform and opening-up policy limiting their assistance for foreign internal economic prosperity.69 Similarly, Sweden and the Netherlands reduced their support in 1981; while Norway and Finland with held their assistance 66 Interview by Andrea Kifyasi with Joseph W.

Political changes and concerns of taxpaye rs over efficiencies of foreign aid prompted their decisions.70 In light of such changes, by the mi d-1980s, Nordic countries joined other traditional donors of the North to push Nyerere' s government to accept Structural Adjustment Programmes (SAPs) terms and conditions. Nyerere was not ready to endorse them. Instead, he stepped out from power to give a chance to a new regime which accepted the conditions wholeheartedly.71 Discussions in the next section show that Nyerere's trust of the Chinese and other donors of the South was further influen ced by the Southern solidarity propelled by various Afro-Asian movements. 1.6 Afro-Asian Movements and the Southern Solidarity Agenda, 1955-1967 The Cold War politics gave birth to nume rous Afro-Asian movements that founded the South-South cooperation (SSC), which prop elled the exchange of resources, technology, experience, and knowledge bilate rally, multilaterally, regionally, and at interregional levels among Southern countries.72 The politics of the Cold War di vided the world into two power blocs, hence prompting the Bandung Conference held in Indonesia on April 18 to 24, 1955, which pioneered establishing the Non-A ligned Movement (NAM) in 1961 Belgrade, Yugoslavia. The Bandung Conference was conven ed under the commitments of five Prime Ministers of Myanmar, Sri Lanka, India, Indonesi a, and Pakistan. Under meetings held from April 28 to May 2, 1954, in Sri Lanka and from December 28 to 29 in Indonesia, they agreed to ally with African and Asian countries to promote economic and cultural cooperation and oppose imperialism, colonialism, and neo-colonial ism. The First Asian-African Conference in Bandung was attended by delegates from 29 African and Asian states, th rough which six were African, and marked the beginning of China's activities in Africa. 73 Through the conference, 70 For instance, the newly elected regime in Sweden did no t cherish socialist ideology prioritised by the former regime, which was compatible with Nyerere's ideology.

The First Asian Conference held in New Delhi in December 1956 intensified plans fo r the Cairo conference. The Delhi Conference formed a preparatory commission that organi sed the first Afro-Asian Conference from December 26, 1957, to January 1, 1958, in which th ey invited about 53 African and Asian countries and territories.76 The Cairo Conference conceived the name \"Afro-Asian Peoples' Solidarity later 1960.77 About 507 participants repr esenting 44 African and Asia n countries attended the Cairo Conference. Unlike the Bandung Conferen ce, which was attended by six countries from Africa, 127 delegates from 19 African count ries and territories attended the Cairo Conference.78 The organisation allowed delegates from Asia and Africa to discuss and find solutions to several economic, political, so cial, and technological problems. The Cairo Conference issued the \"Cairo Declaration\" which condemned Western imperialism, colonialism, and neo-colonialism, and made Cairo the headquarters of the organisation.79 Chinese delegates used the Southern solid arity movement to wi n political recognition over Taiwan.

Such circumstances cau sed the fight for diplomatic recognition to escalate between the Beijing and Taipei regimes. The Chinese government asserted its ad mission to the UN agenda in numerous AAPSO conferences to gain support from countries of Asia and Africa.81 Indeed, the organisation had a promising future for China' s struggle for political recognition since, by 1960, the AAPSO had about sixty member count ries, many of which were UN members.82 Unlike any other, the mainland Chinese govern ment became defacto the predominant member of the AAPSO. It had representatives in ever y committee of the organisation. For instance, it had a representative for the Council, Solidar ity Fund Committee, Executive Committee, and a Permanent Secretariat.83 China's representatives thus played a pivotal role in safeguarding the interests of the Chin ese government in the organisati on. They even upheld the banner criticising the UN, claiming that it was an instrument of neo-colonialism, promoting the AAPSO to demand China's admission to the UN.84 For instance, the Executive Committee meeting held in Beirut from 9 to 13 November 1960, accused the UN of denying the admittance of mainland China to its assembly. 85 Since Taiwan was denied its subscription to AAPSO, Beijing used such a loophole to maintain its po litical influence over Taipei. Votes for the admittance of the Beijing government in the UN Ge neral Assembly (UNGA) rose from two in 1959 to seventeen in 1962.86 Surely, the votes additional result ed from the increasing influence of the Chinese government in African and Asian countries. The AAPSO accrued funds from different gr oups of people and institutions which supported its objectives. Since only a few countries in Africa and Asia could become sponsors, China and the USSR, throughout the 1960s, were the leading donors to the Afro-Asian Solidarity Fund. They provided funds to run th e organisation, scholarships for African and Asian students, medical care, foodstuffs, and clot hes to freedom fighters, which in turn meant 81 Read, for instance, Permanent Secretariat of th e Afro-Asian Peoples' Solidarity Organisations, Afro-Asian Peoples' Solidarity Movement , Afro-Asian Peoples' Solidarity Organisations, Afro-Asian Peoples' Solidarity Movement , Peoples' Solidarity Organisations, Afro-Asian Peoples' Solidarity Movement , 97-113. 84 Read, for instance, a Speech by Liu Ning-I, Head of the Chinese Delegati on and Vice-Chairman of the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity at the 4th Session of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council held in Bandung on April 10, 1961, in The Chinese People Resolutely Support the Just Struggle of the African People, Compiled by The Chinese-African People's Friendship Association (Peking: Foreign Languages Press, 1961), 50. 85 Permanent Secretariat of the Afro-Asian Peoples' Solidarity Organisations, Afro-Asian Peoples' Solidarity Movement , M.

The Chinese government charged that Russia's re visionist policies were similar to those of imperialists and hence were unwanted in Asian-African conferen ces and Afro-Asian movements in general. The Chinese claims divided country members in to three groups as some supported the claim while others opposed, and a few remained neutral.88 Generally, the authorities of China and USSR wrecked the organisation in the attempt to bring it under their resp ective directions. Such circumstances, however, also bolstered the provisi ons of loans and grants to African and Asian countries by the Chinese and USSR governments for the sake of seeking African and Asian support. Despite its fragmentation in the mid- 1960s, the AAPSO established South-South economic, political, social, and technological assistance.89 The AAPSO conference convened in Conakry in April 1960 decried the hegemoni sm of donors to recipient countries. The conference contended: \"We declare that foreign ca pital is not a master but only a guest in our countries. And we will not offend our guest, provid ed he agrees to behave decently and make no attempt to usurp.\"90 Accordingly, participants of the AAPSO Council meeting of April 1961 compiled a list of so-called ag ents of neo-colonialism, in cluding traditional donors whose practice of conditional loan -provision they denounced.91 Parallel to AAPSO's assistance endeavour, Premier Zhou Enlai, in his speech to Ghanaians in January 1964, put forward eight aid principles pledging to respect recipient c ountries' sovereignty, pr omote self-sufficiency, and offer assistance with no strings.92 These principles were de signed to win allies from African and Asian countries, gain their trust, and distinguish Chin ese aid from that of the North. 87 Permanent Secretariat of the Afro-Asian Peoples' Solidarity Organisations, Afro-Asian The Afro-Asian Peoples' Solidarity Organization from April 1960-April 1961, June 15th, 1961 , 20; Omar Ali Amer, \"China and the Afro-Asian Peoples' Solidarity Organization, 1958-1967\" (PhD diss., Geneva University, 1972), 99. 88 \"Chinese Delegates Attacks Russia at AAPSO Meeting,\" Patriot Newspaper , February 26-March 4, 1967. 89 Secretariat of the Afro-Asian Peoples' Solidarity Organisations, Afro-Asian Peoples' Solidarity Movement , Peoples' Solidarity Organisations, Afro-Asian Peoples' Solidarity Peoples' Solidarity Organisations, Afro-Asian Peoples' Solidarity Movement , 28. 92 Eight Principles for Economic and Technical Aid Contended by Premier Zhou Enlai when Answering Questions from Reporters of the Ghana News Agency on January 15, 1964 in Ghana, in Afro-Asian Solidarity Against Imperialism: A Collection of Document s, Speeches and Press Interviews from the Visits of Chinese Leaders to Thirteen African and Asian Countries (Peking: Foreign Languages Press, 1964), 149. 52 Furthermore, members of the AAPSO pi oneered South-South knowledge production and circulation. The Second AAPSO Conference held at Conakry in April 1960, recommended production and exchanges of technical know-how among African and Asian people. Exchange of experts, teachers, doctors, writers, artists, journalists, workers, students, and other technical experts was encouraged to take pl ace on the broadest possible scale.93 Additionally, AAPSO members stressed assist ing one another to improve social and health services. Commitments to helping one an other were reached from the view that some independent countries in Afri ca and Asia were more adva nced than others socially, economically, and scientifically.94 The April 1960 AAPSO resolution reached in Conakry contended that: \"[The] independent Afro-Asian States which have attained economic, social and scientific progress should [. . .] give all possible aid to countries which are still underdeveloped economically, so cially and scientifically.\"95 In this regard, the AAPSO gave rise not only to medical assistance but also economic and political cooperation among member countries. The government of China was among th e first countries from the Global South to provide medical aid to Asia, Af rica, and Latin America. It pr ovided medical services to the freedom fighters in Algeria, Zimbabwe, and Mo zambique. Moreover, it staffed health centres in independent African countries such as Mali, Zanzibar and Tanzania when colonial medical workers had departed after the countries at tained political independence (Chapter 3).96 Discussions in the next section show that Sino-Tanzanian diplomatic relationship further informed China's assistance to the country. 1.7 Sino-Tanzanian Relationship, 1961-1971 We wish to be friendly with all, and we will never allow our friends to choose our enemies for us.

Nyerere, Beijing, February 1965. The preceding statement was uttered by Tanz anian President, Julius Nyerere, in his first visit to China in February 1965. The visit came amid the rifts with Western Germany, the United Kingdom, and other countries in Europe. It was the first, long, and significant trip on which he met and held intensive conversat ions with Chinese President Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai. Nyerere, whom the Ch inese applauded as an outstanding African statesman and a good friend of China, was warmly welcomed with a flood of people waving and lifting placards that reads \"Long Live Sino-Tanzanian Friendship\".98 Nyerere's visit boosted the diplomatic relations, which ha d begun between the two countries in 1961. However, it was the AAPSO that brought toge ther these independent African and Asian countries and popular political movements. Politi cal parties from African and Asian countries such as the African National Congress (ANC) of South Africa , Tanganyika African National Union (TANU) of Tanganyika, and others were AAPSO members. Key freedom fighters from Africa, such as Oscar Kambona of Tanganyi ka, Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia, and Joshua Nkomo of Zimbabwe were me mbers of the AAPSO Council.99 After informal relationships had matured under the umbrella of the AAPSO, the Chinese government established formal diplomatic relations with Tanganyika on the day of independence, December 9, 1961.100 The Sino-Tanzanian relationship grew from 1961 onwards. The Tanzanian government was among the first ten African countr ies to recognise the Be ijing regime at the end of 1961. The Chinese government opened its embassy in Dar es Salaam, becoming the first Chinese embassy in East Africa immediately af ter independence. Its first ambassador, He Ying, presented letters of credentials at the government house in April 1962 and pledged to bolster Sino-Tanzanian friendship. 101 He postulated: \"I am confident that with the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Tanga nyika, the friendship and co-operation between 97 \"Fast Growing Sino-Tanzanian Friendship: China Hails President Nyerere's State Visit,\" Peking Review 8, no. 9, February 26, 1965, 7; Palamagamba Kabudi, \"Tanzania-China Relationship Since the Dawn of the Friendship Treaty,\" Daily News , October 14, 2020. 98 \"Fast Growing Sino-Tanzanian Friendship: China Hails President Nyerere's State Visit,\" Peking Review 8, no. 9, February 26, 1965, 5. 99 Permanent Secretariat of the Afro-Asian Peoples' Solidarity Organisations, Afro-Asian Peoples' Solidarity Movement \"From to Mutual Development,\" 172. 101 \"Tanganyika Receives China's Envoy,\" Sunday News , April 8, 1962, 1. 54 the two countries will be increasingly strengt hened and developed on the basis of Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence a nd the spirit of the Bandung Conference.\"102 Nevertheless, before 1965, the Sino-Tanzan ian relationship deve loped slowly. There were few agreements signed between the tw o governments. For instance, in December 1962, the Tanzanian government signed a Cultural Agreement with China, which was followed by an official visit of Tanzania's cultural delegation led by the Mi nister of National Culture and Youth, Lawi Nangwanda Sijaona, in October 1963. 103 On June 11, 1964, the Second Vice- President of Tanzania, Rashidi Mfaume Kawawa , visited China and sign ed an agreement on Economic and Technical Cooperation. Kawawa's vi sit prompted the openi ng of the Tanzanian embassy in Beijing in October 1964. In February 1965, President Nyerere visited China for the first time and signed the \"Sino- Tanzanian Treaty of Friendship.\"104 Nyerere's visit boosted Sino-Tanzanian friendship as on June 4, 1965, Pr emier Zhou visited the country and pledged to back Tanzania's nation-building agenda.105 Subsequently, on November 22, 1965, the Second Vice-President of Tanzania paid anothe r visit to China regarding negotiations about China's assistance and other diplomatic resolutions.106 The growing Sino-Tanzanian relations led to the opening-up of the Ch inese Economic and Commercial Mi ssion in Dar es Salaam in 1966. These series of events manifested the mo unting development of political and economic ties between the two countries. The Chinese authorities also gained Tan zanian leaders' trust because they had supported the liberation struggles in various African countri es. While the government of Tanzania strongly supported liberation movement s in the Southern African countries, the 102 The Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence referre d by He included mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity; mutual non-aggression; non-interference in each othe r's internal affairs; equality and mutual benefit; and peaceful coexistence.

Several Chinese officials who visited Tanzania repeatedly underscored that both countries were victims of colonialism, and that they had a shared vision of fighting imperialism. 108 Nevertheless, I maintain that China's intimacy with countries of the South was profoundly associated with its struggle for admission to the UNGA. The votes from independe nt countries of the South were vital for China's admission to the UN Assembly. Subs equently, from the mid-1960s, following the growing Sino-Tanzanian ties, the Tanzan ian government actively supported China's admittance to the UN. Its permanent seat establ ished, China's then representative to the UN, danced in the Assembly the day China was officially admitted expressing his happiness.109 Adopting socialist policies in 1967 furt her strengthened the Sino-Tanzanian relationship and set the stage for the Tanzan ian government to receive large sums of development aid from China. Indeed, reliance on China signalled the country's shift from depending on traditional donors of the North. At independence, Br itain had provided more than 90% of development aid to Tanzania. Howeve r, from the mid-1960s, the country depended more on aid and loans from the World Bank's subsidiary IDA (International Development Association), whose assistance am ounted to 37%; the United States (21%); Sweden (13%); China (12%); while the Unite d Kingdom only provided 04%.110 When West Germany and the British governments severed their development aid to Tanzania, as a result of diplomatic strife, Beijing authorities accommodated Tanzania's n eed by offering more grants and loans. For example, in September 1965, the Britain governme nt severed a loan of Tshs. 150 million; but in June 1966, China stepped in and provided a loan of Tshs. 40 million and Tshs. 20 million as a grant. 111 Although the Chinese loans and grants did not cover the gap, it provided a source of relief to the Tanzanian government and won itsel f the trust as a responsib le and reliable ally. Up until December 31, 1967, the Chinese government extended a total of USD 40 million to 107 Lal, African Socialism in Postcolonial Tanzania , 52; Bjerk, Building a Peaceful Nation , 183; 108 \"China Tanzania in Frontline of War Against Imperialism,\" The Nationalist , January 3, 1972, 12. 109 Bailey, \"Tanzania and China,\" 48. 110 Resnick, The long Transition : 54; also see Jeannette Hartmann, \"The Search for Autonomy and Foreign the Arusha Declaration,\" Axel and Son, 1991) 155. 111 Bailey, \"Tanzania and China,\" 43. 56 the Tanzanian government. In the 1968 financ ial report, China ranked second among donor countries to Tanzania.112 China's assistance to Tanzania became even more robust during the 1970s. Government reports show that in 1971, Chin a was the leading donor to the country. Its development aid covered about 56%, followe d by the World Bank with 15%, Sweden 10%, and the USA 8%, to mention just a few.113 Surely, throughout the 1970 s, Tanzania depended heavily on China and Sweden to fund its development projects. As a result, relationships between the two countries prospered, and, in pa rticular, Chinese influences in the country thrived. The blossoming Sino-Tanzanian ties drove economic relations between the two countries. In 1971, for instance, China was the primary source of imports to Tanzania, the position which had been previously occupied by the British government since independence. Sales statistics show that imports from China rose from Tshs. 3.1 million in 1967 to about Tshs. 601 million in 1971.114 Likewise, Tanzanian goods exported to China rose from Tshs. 2.8 million in 1967 to Tshs. 84.1 million in 1971.115 Undoubtedly, political elites in Tanzania passionately endorsed the Sino-Tanzanian relationship. While filled with the spirit of Southern solidarity, President Nyerere denounced claims that the Chinese would dominate his co untry, underscoring that \"China is a friend in need.\"116 His subordinates, too, supported the sta nd on Sino-Tanzanian relations. The Second Vice President of Tanzania, Rashidi Kawawa, even reaffirmed that China's assistance to the country was without strings attached.117 The preceding contentions warrant the belief that, unlike countries of the North, China was perceive d to be a distinctive friend, brother, and an ally of Tanzania and Southe rn countries in general. 112 Emmanuel Tayari, \"A \"Renewal\" China-Tanzania Tr eaty of Friendship 2013\", accessed 30, 2018, http://thecontinentobserver.com/politics/04/28/a -renewal-of-the-china- tanzania-treaty-of- friendship-1965/ 113 Hartmann, \"The Search for Autonomy and Independence,\" 155. 114 Undoubtedly, the blossoming Sino-Tanzanian relations boosted Sino-Tanzanian trade bonds. However, following the Tanzania-Zambia Railway (TAZARA) commodity loan agreement, the governments of Tanzania and Zambia had to import much of Chinese goods. The two countries required to purchase USD 120.3 million in Chinese goods. Each state needed to import USD 24.06 million in Chinese goods annually for at least five years to meet the target. See, George T. Yu, \"Working on the Railroad: China and the Tanzania-Zambia Railway,\" Asian Survey 11, 116 \"China, a Friend in Need-Nyerere,\" The Nationalist , May 7, 1969, 1. 117 \"Misaada ya China Haina Mirija,\" Ngurumo , Februari 12, 1968, 1. 57 Thriving Sino-Tanzanian ties encouraged th e adoption of Chinese-related policies by the Tanzanian government. From the mid-1960s, th e government tasked its delegates in China to learn numerous Chinese development policies as a crucial means of obliterating the hangover of the inherited colonial modernity. 118 Subsequently, some political, economic, and social policies such as the single-party system , self-reliance, rural development, free health care, and the like were adopted by the Tan zanian government (Chapter 2). Nyerere's admiration for Chinese policies was overtly revealed after his first visit to China in February 1965. Upon his return, he addresse d the parliament praising the Chinese development policies, which was moulded on a model of self-reliance, a hardworking spirit , and frugality. Nyerere encouraged his officials and ci tizens in general to follow suit. 119 Indeed, Nyerere was so impressed by the Chinese social, economic, and political system that he implemented some learned kno wledge and experiences in the 1967 launch of the Arusha Declaration. Gene rally, from the mid-1960s to th e 1980s, the two countries signed several bilateral agreements cooperating in the fields of politics, economy, military, culture, and health. Through 1987, the government of China had financed more than 53 projects in Tanzania, making the country China's leading aid recipient in the South. 120 Nevertheless, the Sino-Tanzanian relationship was principally one-sided, with th e Chinese exporting more of their ideas, capital, goods, and t echnical personnel, while Tanzania ns being typically recipients. Yet, unlike other African countri es, the Tanzanian government is reputed to have developed a close friendship relation with China fr om the Mao Zedong era to the present.121 1.8 Conclusion This chapter has examined the contexts whic h gave rise to China's medical assistance in post-colonial Tanzania . It has shown that political as well as social predicaments which confronted the Tanzanian government from th e mid-1960s, made China's medical assistance a necessity. The \"war\" against diseases needed adequate financial and human resources, which Tanzania's government lacked - especially after it squabbled with traditional donors of the North. Such social and political discourses made China's medical assistance appear necessary 118 Bailey, \"Tanzania and China,\" 41. 119 \"Unity Being Cemented, Says Mwalimu: Union Making Great Progress,\" The Nationalist , April 27, 1965, 2. 120 Menghua Zeng, \"An Interactive Persp ective of Chinese Aid Policy: A Case Study of Chinese Aid to Tanzania\" (PhD diss., University of Florida, 1999), 177. 121 Xi Jinping, The Governance of China (Beijing-China: Foreign Language Press, 2014), 333. 58 and emancipatory. Nevertheless, the discussion has shown that Ch ina's medical assistance was strategically used as a means to gain allies fr om independent African countries. In Tanzania, medical assistance strengthened diplomatic re lations with the Beijing regime and made the Tanzanian government a vanguard of the batt le for China's admission to the UNGA. Against the foregrounding done in this chapter, subse quent chapters discuss several Chinese-funded health projects in different part s of Tanzania from 1968 to the 1980s. 59 CHAPTER TWO: GOING EAST? A SOCIALIST HEALTH SYSTEM AND ITS PRACTICE IN TANZANIA, 1967-1995 2.1 Introduction Unlike the previous chapter, which examined forces behind China's medical assistance, this chapter adds know ledge to studies on Tanzanian so cialism. Several studies have examined the implications of soci alist policies on economic activities1 and environments,2 drawing strong critics underscoring that th e policies impeded the economic and social development of the country, however leaving out other key concerns , including social infrastructures such as health, water, and sc hools. Other scholars studied the development of the health sector in Tanzan ia and the practice of social ist-related health services.3 While these and other studies have contributed significantl y to understanding Tanzanian socialism and the health system, they are both broad and general in their approach. As a result, they rarely discussed the ways and the extent to which the South-South cooperati on (SSC) promoted the production and circulation of me dical knowledge and experiences within the S outhern world. This chapter, therefore, examines the influenc e of the Southern solidarity agenda into the diffusion of Chinese-related health policies in Ta nzania. It identifies health policies which the government learnt from China and assess its pr acticality to a young and low-income country. 1 Maxmillian J.

It further ar gues that the practice of free health care, the institutionalisation of traditional medicine, rural health care and the banning of private health services were informed by knowle dge that the delegates learnt from China. Nevertheless, the chapter shows that some policies adopted were marked by colonial continuities. The government manipulated both co lonial and Chinese health policies to make them fit into its social, economic and political plans. Ho wever, the economic crisis of the 1980s, which coincided with liberalisation policies, affected these health policies. The chapter builds upon the argument that the adoption of Chinese h ealth policies did not onl y signal that Tanzania was evolving toward the east but also manifested the resolve of Southern countries to encounter their social challenges th rough sharing knowledge and experiences among themselves. 2.2 Tanzanian Socialism: Learning from China? Prior to 1967, the Tanzanian government had no clear ideology, but rather positioned itself as a non-aligned country with neither capitalist nor socialist commitments. However, from the mid-1960s, the government adopted seve ral policies connected to socialism. It introduced the Arusha Declaration in Ja nuary 1967, which was endorsed by the National Executive Council (NEC) of Tangany ika National Union (TANU), the ru ling party, in February 1967.4 To implement socialist policies, TANU laid down the principles of socialism in its constitution. It denounced class differentiation and postulated that all human beings were equal and had rights to dignity and respect. End eavouring to ensure economic justice, TANU welcomed the government's effective c ontrol over the major means of production.5 Definitely, the policies of TANU and the Ar usha Declaration defined the social, economic and political path of the government, which spearhead ed two main principles, \"socialism\" and \"self- reliance\". Under socialism, the Declaration oug ht to eliminate the ex ploitation of \"man by man\" and consolidate the government's control of major means of produc tion such as land, forests, minerals, water, oil, electricity, banks, and industries. According to the principle of self-reliance, the government was diffident to fo reign grants, loans, private investments, and 4 C. G. Kahama, T. L. Maliyamkono and Stuart Wells, The Challenge for Tanzania's Economy (Dar es Salaam: Tanzania Publishing House, 1986), 31. 5 URT, The Arusha Declaration and TANU's Policy on Socialism and Self-Reliance (Dar es Salaam: Publicity Section 1967), 1. 61 other forms of assistance, driving it into a depe ndent state. At the same time, it encouraged self-help schemes and local resources as primary agents of development.6 Socialism, loudly pronounced after the Ar usha Declaration, draws its background from TANU's pamphlet drafted by President Ju lius Nyerere in 1962. Nyerere endeavoured to make socialism TANU's ideology and soci o-economic policy that would underpin the government's activity.7 Indeed, at first, the ideology wa s all about Nyerere's thoughts, and he wrote almost all the theoretical papers and books. Thus, it took ti me for officials at different administrative levels, party leaders and c itizens to understand and implement the policy accordingly.8 Characteristically, socialism, famously known as Ujamaa in Tanzania, was meant to be \"Tanzanian socialism\". The adoption of the Kiswahili word Ujamaa deliberately aimed to root its meaning in traditional concep tion. Nyerere insisted that it used the African word \" Ujamaa \" to emphasise the African-ness of the adopted policy. The literal meaning of Ujamaa was \"family-hood\". According to Nyerere, the term \"socialism\" meant the art of living and working together for communal benefit.9 He added that Tanzanian socialism was based on the pre-colonial past with its unique design. In his words: \"We are not importing a foreign ideology into Tanzania and trying to smother our distinct social patterns with it. We have deliberately decided to grow as a society out of our own roots, but in a particular direction and towards a particular kind of objective.\"10 From Nyerere's words, Tanzanian socialism was founded from certain charac teristics of a traditiona l social organisation. Thus, the socialist policy adopted in 1967, extended and modified traditional social relations to meet life challenges in the tw entieth-century world. Drawing from traditional patterns of social living, Ny erere aimed to create something unique from the prominent socialist architects.11 Nevertheless, scholars contes ted Nyerere's claims that Ujamaa was 6 URT, The Arusha Declaration and TA NU's Policy on Socialism and Self-Relia nce, 1-4; also see Rune Skarstein and Samuel M.

J. L. Kanywany underscores that nothing was purely African about Ujamaa; instead, it was only its linguistic expression. In his view, many of which were st ated in the manifesto were taken from Asian and European socialist convenors.12 I similarly hold that Nyer ere adopted several ideas and practices from Maoism (discussed below). Tanzanian socialism was arguably founde d on the view that capitalism was undesirable for the economic, soci al and political development of Tanzania and Africa, as, for instance, seen in the fact that there were few indigenous cap italists in independent African countries to conceive and maintain a capital ist economy. Nyerere strictly opposed reliance on foreign capitalists to develop a capitalist econo my in Tanzania, arguing that they would threaten African countries' sovereig nty through their unbearable conditions.13 Unfortunately, a full-brown socialist state was also unattainable to low-income African countries. However, Nyerere was intrigued by Maoism, which, unlik e Marxism-Leninism, maintained that the peasantry possessed socialist consciousness, so were the revolutionary vanguard in pre- industrial nations than proletariats.14 Furthermore, Nyerere argued that socialism - unlike capitalism - had roots in traditional African social organisation. Nyerere envisioned that African countries would maintain self-reliance an d develop human equality and dignity for all people through socialism.15 At the same time, the Tanzanian socialis t ideology adopted many of its ideas from China. In his first visit to China in 1965, Ny erere was impressed by several observations, including the commune system, self-relian ce, and frugality of the Chinese people.16 Nyerere visited China for the second time in 1968 and postul ated that he had \"[...] come to China to learn [....] The last three days have confirmed my conviction that we have a lot to learn from 12 J.

Contrary to the view that a full-blown socialist nation could not exist in low-income countries, the pr actice of the policy in China showed promising results and gave courage to other countries to follow suit. In his third trip to China in April 1974, Nyerere reaffirmed how the practice of socialism in Chin a inspired his regime. He argued: Two things convince me that socialism can be built in Africa and that it is not a Utopian vision. For capitalism is ultimately incompatib le with the real independence of African states. The second thing which encourages me is China. It is because it appears to me that, among the millions of unique individuals in this society, there has been created a spirit of working together for the good of the community and the country. China is providing an encouragement and an inspiration for younger and smaller nations which seek to build socialist societies.19 The preceding expositions testify to the fact that Tanzanian socialism learned enough from China. Nevertheless, Nyerere denied such allegations, underscori ng that the policy was based on the needs of the peopl e and not on Chinese philosophy.20 He added that claims of copying the policies from Moscow and Beijing subscribe to the vi ew that Africa , and in this particular case, Tanzania, had nothing to contri bute to the world and that all good things came from elsewhere. However, Nyerere admitted that adopting some ideas from any other place was not a sin provided that the government lear ned and proceeded to think and not to copy. 21 When Nyerere visited China in 1974, he undersco red that learning from China did not mean he would implement the policy uncritically. He told Mao Zedong that: \"We shall not flatter you by trying to make an exact copy of what we see. But I hope we shall be good pupils who learn and then apply their le ssons to their own situation.\"22 In this regard, Nyerere did not limit 17 \"President Nyerere's Speech at the Farewell Banquet he Gave in Peking on June 21,\" Peking Review , no. 26, June 28, 1968, 8. 18 \"President Nyerere's Speech at the Farewell Banquet he Gave in Peking on June 21,\" Peking Review , no. 26, June 28, 1968, 8. 19 \"President Nyerere Ends Visit to China,\" Peking Review 17, no. 14, April 5, 1974, 7. 20 \"Nyerere's Stress on Self-reliance,\" The Nationalist , April 9-15, , 47-48. 22 \"Chairman Mao Meets Nyerere,\" Peking Review 17, no. 13, March 29, 1974, 9. 64 himself to the Chinese. Instead, he learned policies from China and other socialist and non- socialist countries and moulded them to fashion \"socialism with Tanzanian characteristics\". Discussions in the subsequent sections s how that at independence, Tanzania and China faced similar health challenges. They both encountered medical dependencies, unequal provision of health services between the haves and the have-nots, rura l and urban areas and other social disparities. Such commonalities gave room for the exchanges of knowledge and experiences. 2.3 Free Health Care, 1967-1988 Under German and British col onial governments in Tanganyika , health services to the indigenous population had not been provided free of cost , as patients in all hospital grades paid for the service. In some incidences, the col onial governments provided free health care to deprived communities. In most cases, colonial health care was extended to only a few areas, preferentially in the pr oduction zones, settlers' habitations and a few bus iness towns and cities. Worse still, the services were racially segregat ed, Europeans enjoying the first-class healthcare, Indians, Arabs and coloured the second, and Africans the third.23 The colonial government prioritised the wellbeing of la bourers, settlers, soldiers, busi nesspersons and administrative personnel who directly contribu ted to colonial economic produc tion. The neglect of Africans' access to colonial health care led them to re ly on local healing systems. Indeed, throughout colonial periods, social and ec onomic status was the determini ng factor in the provision of health services. Thus, the post- colonial Tanzanian government in herited a capitalist-oriented health care system characterised by an une qual distribution and provision of health care services. Nevertheless, the post-colonial gove rnment did not promptly undo colonial health policies. Instead, it made some adjustments to accommodate patients with low income. For example, in 1962, the government issued hospital fees for patients attending government hospitals. The fees varied depending on the grad es of hospitals. Grade I, outpatients were charged Tshs. 20 per day while grade III outpatie nts paid Tshs. 2. The government offered free health services to outpatients admitted to Grade IV hospitals.24 23 Kjell J. Havnevick, et al., Tanzania: Country Study and Norwegian Aid Review (Moss: A/S Repro-Trykk, 1988), 15. 24 Grade II hospital were not included in the schedule as they were discontinued. More information is available in, \"Government Hospital Fees, a General Notice, July 1, 196 2,\" TNA. Acc. No. 450, Ministry of Health, File No. HEM/20/14, Privat e Practice Policy. 65 Costs for inpatient services varied depending on the status of the hospital and grade. For instance, grade I inpatients admitted to Princess Margaret (now Muhimbili), Mount Meru (Arusha), and Tanga hospitals were charged Tshs. 60 per day, while grade I inpatients admitted to all other hospitals paid Tshs. 50 per day. Simi larly, grade II inpatients admitted to the same hospitals mentioned above paid Tshs. 35 per day while grade II inpatients admitted to all other hospitals paid Tshs. 30 per day. Such variances were not noticed to grade III inpatients since they all paid Tshs. 6 per three da ys in all hospitals. As it was to outpatients, grade IV inpatients received free health care in all hospitals. 25 Additionally, half of the standard fee was charged for children under the apparent age of 14. When the child was an infant so young that was considered desirable on medical grounds to admit the mother also, a single fee at adult rates was charged. The antenatal registration fee for attendance at grade I outpatient sessions was charged Tshs. 60. The mentioned fee covere d all of outpatient examinations and investigations. 26 Generally, the 1962 health policy brought slight changes to the delivery of health services in Tanzania. It gave a chance for grade IV, both inpatients and outpatients to get free health services in public hospitals and sections. Howeve r, the policy retained health service grades and fees as introduced by the col onialists. Offering health services in grades maintained social inequalities between the have s and the have-nots. Such differentiations were inconsistent with the soci alist policies which the g overnment adopted in 1967. While on his first visi t to China in Februa ry 1965, President Nyerere admired China's health care policies and subse quently devised a socialist a pproach to healthcare. After Nyerere's visit, the MoH set plans for lear ning about China's health system, sending a delegation of medical doctors to China for a stud y tour in 1966. Several aspects of the Chinese health policy, including free health care, enthus ed the delegates. The MoH considered free health care as important and consistent with the government's socialist policies.27 Subsequently, after the Arusha Declaration, the country's nati onal health policies emphasised the need to provide equitable and sufficient h ealth services to all citizens. The socialist government perceived hospital fees illegitimate since they conso lidated social disparities and 25 \"Government Hospital Fees, a General Notice, July 1, 1962,\" TNA. Acc.

Mzee Butiku worked at the statehouse as a personal research assistant of Mwalimu Nyerere from 1965. 66 restrained access to health care to low-inco me communities. Therefore, under Tanzania's socialist health system, the gove rnment provided free health se rvices in both inpatient and outpatient clinical services through a network of established government dispensaries, health centres, and hospitals.28 Extending free health care - maintained access to essential health services to all, which, in turn, enabled the coun try to have a healthy community and serviceable labour force needed for national development. Concurrently, the free health care went synchronously with free education from primary to university levels a nd hence rekindled the fight against \"enemies\" of development, ignorance, poverty, a nd disease, declared by Nyerere. Undeniably, free health care was burdenso me to the Tanzanian government, which had to allocate sufficient funds to purchase and distribute medicines and medical equipment. From 1970 to 74, the health sector's share in the total government expe nditure ranged from 6 to 6.9%. At its beginning, the government could afford the co sts because the population was relatively small, not more than 13 million peop le. The increase in popula tion went parallel with the increase in costs for the free health care. Fo r instance, spending for the health sector rose to more than 7% of the total government e xpenditure from 1975 to 77, following the increase in population from 13.171 million in 1970 to 16.498 million in 1977 (Table 3). The annual increase in population raised g overnment expenditure in the he alth sector, wh ich, in turn, threatened the supply of free heal th care to a low-income country. The delivery of free health se rvices declined officially in 1988. During this period, the government could no longer afford financing h ealth services due to economic challenges caused by the high debts, droughts, decreased donor funding, diseases, oil crisis and devaluations.29 From 1978 to 1989, the government budge t records show that the soaring population from 15.976 million in 1975 to 22.611 million in 1987 overwhelmed the government's ability to afford free health care. Its spending on the health sector fell from 7.1% in 1975/76 to 4.0% in 1987/88 (Table 3). 28 Havnevick, et al., Tanzania: Country Study , 168. 29 See, for instance, T. L. Maliyamkono and M. S. D.

Such decline exacerbated mate rnal mortality rates and diminished the availability of drugs and medical equipment in the government-owned hospitals.30 The government's failure pulled the country towards major lending institutions such as th e World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF), which, among other cond itions, required the government to reduce spending in the social sector , including health. For instance, in 1987, the World Bank advocated greater reliance on user charges, in surance mechanisms, the private sector and administrative decentralisation policies to overcome the crisis.31 30 Angwara D.

While the pressure from these multilateral lenders and other traditional development partners were behind the country's move to the cost-sharing policy, the government did not openly admit it. Instead, it defended the decisions arguing that the policy aimed at generating additional revenue for health facility operations, increasing the quality of health services in government fac ilities, strengthening th e referral system and rationalising the utilisation of health services, as well as improving equality and access to health services.32 Admittedly, pressure from outside and within forced the Tanzanian socialist regime to turn to capitalist pol icies, which it had been critic ising since 1967. I hold that the commencement of cost-sharing po licy was among means the government adopted to win back the sympathy of traditiona l donors of the North after they ha d withheld their assistance to the country throughout the 1980s. The cost-sharing trial started in 1988 with ev ery outpatient paying Tshs. 20 in a single attendance at any public heal th centre. However, its im plementation brought several challenges, such as the mishandling of the coll ected dues in the hospitals since medical workers lacked practical knowledge of financial mana gement. Furthermore, low-income communities complained that they could not afford the proposed fees. These and many other reasons prompted the government to drop the fee shortly afterwards, stating that it needed further research and analysis to implement the policy effectively.33 However, the 1990 joint research by Tanzanian medical experts and Britain Development Agency affirmed that Tanzanians were ready for a cost-sharing program. The readiness of the people was rooted in their determination to see improvement in the provision of hea lth care services. From the mid-1980s, economic shortfall led to inadequate provisions of health care services in Tanzania. As a result, many public health centres lacked essential medicines and medical equipment. The crisis further led to the overall deterioration of physical health infrastructures such as electricity and water supply. It also impelled poor management, low wages and other incentives for health care Hegemony,\" in Re-Thinking the Arusha Declaration , ed. Jeannette Hartmann (Copenhagen: Axel Nielsen and Son A/S, 1991), 135. 32 T. L. Maliyamkono and H. Mason, The Promise (Dar es Salaam: TEMA Publishers, 2006), 454. 69 workers, which, in turn, lowered their morale.34 These circumstances drove both internal and external demands for the Tanzanian government to introduce several fo rms of cost-sharing. Implementation of the cost-sharing po licy resumed in 1993 when the government reintroduced health service grades (I, II, III, IV ) which redefined the quality of the services, costs, and kinds of prospective patients. Undou btedly, the grades sust ained the colonial and pre-socialist social disparities whereby patie nts with high, middle, and low incomes received health services with varying qua lities. High-income patients affo rded costs charged at grade I and II, which were relatively hi gher for more sophisticated he alth services. For instance, upon its commencement, patients attending grade I and II paid a consultation fee of Tshs. 500 at referral, 300 for regional and 150 for district hospitals. Furthermore, grade I patients paid hospitalisation fee of Tshs. 2,000 at referral, 1,500 at regional and 1,000 for district hospitals per patient per day. While grade II patients pa id Tshs. 1,000 for the refe rral, 750 for regional and 500 for district hospitals. The government an ticipated that patients who demanded grade I and II services would eagerly accept the cost-shari ng policy; as a result, they were the first to be touched by the policy on July 1, 1993.35 In contrast, middle-income patients attended mostly to grade III health services where the quality of the services was moderate consiste nt with their costs. Patients of this category paid consultation fees of Tshs. 300 for referral, 200 for regional and 100 for district hospitals. Unlike grades, I and II, grade III patients paid once for the hospitalisation irrespective to hospitalisation period. For instance, they paid Tshs. 500 in referral, 300 for regional and 150 for district hospitals. The cost-sharing for this category was effective in the second phase commencing on January 1, 1994. Admittedly, gr ades, I, II and III, accommodated fewer Tanzanians, mostly being businessm en, political elites and a few groups of formal and informal employees. The majority of Tanzanians with lo w-incomes attended grade IV health services, which offered cheap but poor services. The serv ices for this category were mostly executed through health centres an d dispensaries. Unlike grades, I, II and II, the government gave time for grade IV beneficiaries and service providers to get prepared for the cost-sharing scheme, 34 JMT, Kida, Implications of Health Sector Reforms in Tanzania: Policies, Indicators and Accessibility to Health Services (Dar es Salaam: The Economic and Social Research Foundation (ESRF), 2014), 1. 35 JMT, and the charges commenced in 1996 (see below).36 The government used two-thirds of revenues collected to purchase medicines and me dical equipment, and the remainder was spent on other health-rela ted expenditures.37 On the one hand, revenues collected through cost- sharing were an essential resource for the improve ment of the quality of health care services. On the other hand, community financing transf erred the responsibility of the socialist government to a third party. As hinted above, the cost-sharing program bega n late for rural dispensaries (grade IV) to give time for the government to persuade v illagers to accept the policy and train service providers in proper ways of collecting and handling funds. The government noted that the effective execution of the policy demanded more preparation, including training in financial management, printing of receipts books, and training medical workers.38 It took until 1996 for the government to establish th e Community Health Fund (CHF), through which villagers and other non-civil servants voluntarily joined the prepayment scheme. The scheme aimed to reach about 85% of the population living in rural areas and others out side the formal employment sector. Under CHF, household members paid a fi xed annual fee to get access at the primary level of health facilities. 39 Moreover, in 1999, the Tanzanian government introduced the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF), aiming at providing quality health care to its recipients. The early beneficiaries of the scheme were civil servants a nd their dependants, but it has become recently open to private member ship. Under NHIF, employees in the public formal sector contributed 3% of their monthl y salary, and their empl oyers matched the same. NHIF covered health costs for the principal member, spouse a nd up to four below eighteen years legal dependants. The actual execution of the Insurance was realised in 2001. The MoH assured NHIF members of getting sustainable health care in all public hospitals and some privately run hospitals.40 However, the membership turnout has been less promising.

Nevertheless, from the 1990s to the pres ent, the government offered free health services to four groups of patient s. These included: children of 0 -5 years, pregnant women (clinic and delivery), elders of 60 years and above, and patients with contagious diseases such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, TB, leprosy and sickle-cell anemia, regardless of their ability to pay.43 Notwithstanding a few categories of people, for whom the government waived their hospital fees, the introduction of cost-sharing buried equali ty in the delivery of health services since people with low income were unable to afford the prescribed costs, and many turned to traditional medicine and church hospitals which charged lower fees.44 Consequently, cost- sharing contributed significantly to dismantling the socialist h ealth system, which lasted for more than two decades in Tanzania. 2.4 Institutionalisation of Traditional Tanzanian Medicine, 1968-1990 Before the coming of Europeans to Africa and Tanzania in particular, Africans depended entirely on local methods of diagnosis a nd treatment of diseases. Even after European missionaries and colonial governments came to the continent, the majority of Africans continued to rely on traditional medicine not only because modern curative facilities were not adequate but also the traditional methods of th erapy were considered more effective by many Africans.45 Certainly, biomedical practic es did not fully dismantle traditional healing systems46 41 URT, National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF), First Quarter Fact Sheet, September 2018 , 3-4. 42 Selemani Mbuyita and Ahmed Makemba, \"Equity in in Tanzania: Translating National Goals to District Realities,\" EQUINET Discussion Paper , no. 54 (Dec.

It uses mainly medicinal plants, mineral substances, and animal parts, and relies exclusively on traditional healers to provide health care. While herbalism is the most common practice, it also relies on divination and spiritualism. See, WHO, WHO Global Report on Traditio nal and Complementary Medicine, 2019, 8; M. Fawzi 72 in Tanzania, and Africa at larg e. Instead, local healers integrated several elements of biomedical practices such as injections, which seemed useful in curing ailments.47 The practice of traditional healing systems in Tanzania wa s, however, strongly criticised by missionaries who perceived it as \"heathen\". Missionaries attempted to defeat local healing systems by spreading biomedical health care in several parts of the country. They deva lued local medicine by linking it to superstition whil e promoting biomedicine as an alternative. Therefore, throughout colonial periods, missi onaries attached religious ac tivities to heal th services, underscoring the rhetoric of saving the \"body\" and \"soul\" to win converts. 48 In contrast, both German and British colo nialists recognised traditional health practitioners as health service providers. Howeve r, their services were strictly controlled and sometimes restricted over witchcraft accusations.49 During the German colonial era, the practice of traditional medicine was open to practitioners with certificates indicating their locations of practice and illne sses they treated. Through the British Medical Practitioners and Dentists Ordinance of 1929, the British coloni al government allowed traditional health practitioners to practice in their communities under permissi on from respective traditional authorities.50 However, the government prohibited h ealing systems which involved the so- called witchcraft practices such as divination. The Witchcraft Ordinance of 1928 viewed the possession of charms, occult powers, organisation of ordeal or any other \"witchcraft\" practices as a crime liable to imprisonment of not exceed ing seven years or fine amounting to Shs. 4,000.51 The British colonial government banned witchcraft-related practices following the lesson learnt during the Maji Maji war of 1905 to 07, where witchdoctors greatly influenced warriors to fight the German colonial rule fear lessly. Although Africans were greatly defeated, the colonial government worried about their persua sive power and consider ed them a threat to Mohomoodally, \"Traditional Medicine in Africa: An Ap praisal of Ten A frican Medicinal Evidence-Based Altern ative 1-3. 47 Megan Vaughan, Curing their Ills: Colonial Power and African Illness (Cambridge: Polity Press, 1991), 24. 48 Terence O.

For instance, in 1928, through its res earch station at Amani-Tanga, the colonial government assigned a botanist to examine e fficacies of herbal medicine used by local practitioners. Subsequen tly, in the 1934/35 annual report, the colonial botanist reported that some medicinal plants used by local herbalis ts might be useful in European pharmacology.54 On the one hand, this implies that the colonial government controlled th e practices of local healing systems for their ends, but on the other, the permission granted to local herbalists played a role in developing traditional medi cal knowledge during colonisation, thus laying the ground for its flourishing duri ng the post-colonial period. Notwithstanding the practicality and acceptabil ity of traditional medicine in the pre- colonial and during the col onial period, the independent Tanzanian government did not promptly promote the practice of traditional medicine. It neither coordinated nor linked activities of traditional health practitione rs with the organised health services. 55 However, after the Arusha Declaration of 1967, the government began to promote the use of traditional medicine to maintain its endurance amid the spread of biomedicine. The government encouraged local healing practi ces to rescue a health sector nearly overwhelmed by the country's soaring population and di sease burden amid the government's drive to extend health care to all. Moreover, under the self-reliance policy, the government antic ipated promoting the practice of traditional medicine to avoid de pendence on biomedicine. During this period, the government perceived traditional medicine as a valuable resource for the actual development of health care. The promotion of traditional medicine further aimed to enable Tanzanians to address health challenges usi ng their local medical knowledge. Severe reliance on imported biomedicine seemed to bolster the wealth to the Global North. Thus, given the country's weak economy, biomedicines were too expensive to import. 56 52 Langwick, Bodies, Politics, and African Healing , 45-46. 53 According to WHO, herbal medicines include herbs, herbal materials, herbal preparations and finished herbal products that contain, as active ingredients, parts of plants, other plant materials or combinations thereof. In some countries, herbal medicines may contain, by tradition, na tural organic or inorganic active ingredients that are not of plant origin such as animal and mineral materials. See, WHO, WHO Global Report on Traditional and Complementary Medicine, 2019, 8. 54 Langwick, Bodies, Politics, and African Healing , 53. 55 Titmuss, Abel-Smith, Macdonald, Williams, and Wood, The Health Services of Tanganyika , 72. 56 Mahunnah, Uiso and Kayombo, Documentary of Traditional Medicine in Tanzania , 18; Langwick, Bodies, Politics, and African Healing , 9-10. 74 The 1968 symposium on African Me dicinal Plants held in Senegal, which Tanzanian officials attended, further exemplified the need to promote the use of traditional African medicine. The attempts, however, were insp ired by the Chinese health system, which prioritised the use of traditional medicine. Af ter the Chinese Communi st Revolution of 1949, Mao Zedong directed practitioners of traditional medicine and western-trained medical doctors to work together. The Chinese government enc ouraged traditional hea lth practitioners to contribute their medical knowledge for the development of health care.57 Therefore, traditional health practitioners and western- trained doctors worked together, and they were all paid by the government. The Chinese government went furthe r by establishing schools and colleges which offered teachings and training to traditional medicine students. In 1955, it institutionalised traditional medicine and established the Academ y of Traditional Chinese Medicine, currently called China Academy of Chinese Medical Scien ces (CACMS), which played a vital role in adding scientific value to traditional Chinese medicine through medical research and training. Up to 1964, there were about 20 medical college s and schools, training doctors in traditional Chinese medicine. 58 Formally trained traditional health practitioners covered the gap of the needed medical personnel, which, in turn, redu ced mortality and morbidity rates from 250 at the Revolution-era to 10 per 1000 in the 1970s. Furthermore, life expectancy rose from 30 at liberation period to 70 in the 1970s. Through the use of both traditional and biomedicine, the government eradicated most trou bling diseases such as schi stosomiasis, polio, measles, whooping cough, malaria, trachoma, typhoi d fever, bilharzia, and smallpox.59 The Tanzanian government admired the achievements that China attained over a short period and took several initiatives to lear n from them. The 1966 delegation of the MoH recommended, among others, the institutionalisa tion and use of traditional medicine in hospitals parallel to western biomedicine. Lucy Lameck, who was also a delegate, was impressed with the use of traditional Chinese medi cine together with biomedicine. She said: \"I visited one hospital and saw many boxes full of medicinal herbs.

In 1968, the government legally recognised and began to move towards the integration of traditional and biomedicine. The Medical Practitioners and Dentist Ordinance of 1968 recognised the ex istence of traditional health practitioners62 and their right to practice traditional medicine.63 Yet, not all kinds of h ealers were legally allowed to practice their services. Instead, the governme nt adopted the 1928 Witc hcraft Ordinance and hence prohibited healers whose medical practic es invoked supernatural powers. Under such contexts, the government's legal system did not accept divinations, and it perceived them as chaotic and a threat to the nation's peace and secu rity as well as development. Thus, herbalists were more encouraged than specialist s in spirit possession or sorcerers.64 These attempts imply that the post-colonial government endeavoured to differentiate \"witchcraft\" practices from healing and magic as it had been the cas e during the British colonial period. The legal recognition of the local health sy stem eased the establishment of the first National Union of Traditional Healers (UWATA) in 1971. The Union was a useful forum for medical knowledge exchanges and cooperation among practitioners. Furthermore, through UWATA, the government monitored the activities of trad itional health practi tioners to enhance their effectiveness.65 The government allowed practices of local healing systems prone to registering with the Mo H at their respective district offi ces. Through their registration form, healers recorded places they intended to wo rk, kinds of diseases they cured and the 60 My translation from Kiswahili in in \"China's Obligation to Small Nations,\" The Nationalist , June 30, 1967, 8. 62 It should be recalled that traditional medicine practitioners in Tanzania comprised of herbalists, ritualists or spiritualists and midwives Heggenhougen, \"Health Services: Official , ed. an Institute of African Studies, 1986), 312; Vaughan, Curing their Ills, 60. 63 URT, Medical Practitioners and Dentists Ordinance (Amendment) Act, May 1968 . 64 Mesaki, \"Witchcraft and the Law in Tanzania,\" 132. 65 Mahunnah, Uiso and Kayombo, Documentary of Traditional Medicine in Tanzania , 7; Ann Beck, \"The Traditional Healer in Tanzania,\" A journal of Opinion 9, no. 3 (Autumn 1979): 4. 76 commitment that their therapies did not involve the so-called witchcraft.66 The registration did not only help the government to control their services but also have their statistics. Nevertheless, the recognition was negatively perceived by conventional doctors who mistrusted the ability and effectiveness of trad itional health practitione rs. Conventional doctors opposed the ministry's call for cooperation between traditional and conventional health practitioners.67 The increasing mistrust be tween the two groups of hea lth service providers was not only a challenge but also an opportunity for the scientific development of traditional medicine. The ministry made several attempts to \"modernise\" activities of traditional health practitioners through scientific research. In 1969, it launched research on traditional medicine that involved contacting famous local traditi onal African doctors and recording their methods of practice in accurate detail. Th e government research team also carried out chemical analysis of herbs used in treatment by traditional health pract itioners and made clinical trials for selected methods of treatment.68 The institutionalisation of traditi onal medicine was an giving freedom to tradi tional health practiti oners who had been o ffering their services in the dark corners due to intimidation by religious leaders and government authorities.69 Initiatives to scientific research, institu tionalisation, and integration of traditional medicine with biomedicine made a breakth rough in 1974. During this period the government launched a research unit for traditional medicine at the University of Dar es Salaam's Faculty of Medicine of Muhimbili Medical College. The Traditional Medicine Research Unit (TMRU), which became an Institute of Traditional Medi cine (ITM) in 1991, strive d to put biomedically efficacious herbal medicine for use by convent ional and traditional health practitioners.70 It played a role in id entifying useful health practices that co uld be adopted, and materia medica , which could be modernised and developed into drugs for use by humans. Furthermore, the institute was determined to disentangle pre- colonial and colonial ways of communicating traditional medicinal knowledge, which mainly re lied on informal training and inheritance by establishing formal training for pr actitioners of traditional medi cine.

From its inception, the inst itute conducted systematic st udies and research of the plants suitable for making drugs for human use. It further embarked on the development of gardens for medicinal and aromatic plants. The MoH anticipated that the research carried out by the institute would promote the development a nd use of traditional medicine and substitute imported drugs.72 Besides medical research, the institute held scientific proof of medicines produced by traditional health pr actitioners to ensure their safety for human consumption, and above all, improve their practices , turning it into a credible scientific cure.

Dr Ka pingu is a senior research at the ITM 78 regularised activities of the pr actitioners without depriving th em of their medical knowledge and social functions.73 The establishment of the TM RU eased the flow of traditional medical knowledge between the practitioners of China and Tan zania. On December 13, 1962, the two countries signed the Cultural Agreement in which, among other things, they agreed to exchange experiences in the fields of m odern and traditional medicine.74 The agreement was reached while the Tanzanian government had yet to recogn ise and institutionalise traditional medicine legally. Thus, throughout the 1960s, traditional me dical knowledge exchanges practically did not exist between the two countri es. Instead, the medical knowledge exchanges realised in the 1970s after the launch of the Sino-Tanzanian Joint Project on Traditional Medicine. The research project yielded promising results and added value to the development of traditional medicine. Between 1974 and 1975, the joint research team collected samples of over 1,000 herbs used by traditional heal ers in Tanzania (Figure 3). 75 In 1977, traditional medicine researchers from ITM took over the research project and collected about 2,500 specimens of medicinal plants. Some specimens tested in th e laboratory were efficac ious, and researchers endorsed them for clinical trials.76 In the 1980s, initi atives in favour of using traditi onal medicine parallel to western biomedicine showed promising results. During this period, the ITM endorsed efficacious medicines for use in hospitals alongside modern medicine. The Minister for Health spoke to the National Assembly that about seven types of herbal drugs researched by the institute would be ready for use in hospitals by 1985. The Fa culty of Medicine at the Muhimbili Medical College proved that the medicines presen ted were able to cure some diseases.77 Moreover, in 1990, the institute conducted research on traditi onal medicine capable of treating diabetes, 73 Morice Maunya, \"Traditional Healers now in Mainstream Health Services,\" Daily News , February 28, 1991, 5; Beck, \"The Traditional Healer in Tanzania,\" 4. 74 Read, for instance, Article 6 in URT, Cultural Agreement Between the Government of the United Republic of Tanzania and the Government of the People's Republic of China, 1962 , 3. 75 Economic Commission for Africa, Chemical Industry Development Programme: Report of the First ECA/UNIDO Chemical Indus try Development Programme Mission, May-October 1978 , 113; Langwick, Bodies, Politics, and African Healing , 62. 76 \"Amend your Laws on Medicine, Africa Told,\" Daily News , September 30, 1977, 3; also see \"Tenth Anniversary of Muhimbili Medical Centre,\" Daily News , August 3, 1987, 5. 77 The seven herbal drugs included azadirachta indica - a popular herb locally known as Mwarobaini - used for treating malaria and fever, calendula officinalis with a potential for treating stomach pains, cinchona succirubra used for the preparation of quinine and chloroquine drugs for malaria cases, cynara scolymas for containing blood vein problems, digitalis lanata for heart ailments, saponaria officinalis and tagets patula for treating blindness, see \"Herbs Enter Conventional Medicine,\" Sunday News , July 28, 1985, 5; \"Local Herbs Usable in Hospitals,\" Daily News , March 21, 1987, 3.

Amo ng the eight kinds of traditional medicines observed, one was effective in controlling diabetes and others were capable of curing chronic malaria and ulcers.78 Surely, achievements reached by the ITM brought hope and relief as the availability of more local medicine would ease the burden on the government, which spent a considerable amount of forei gn currency to import drugs. Above all, the discovered local medicines were particularly meaningful in cu rbing the dominance of biomedicine in health care and therefore a promising step toward self-reliance.

From 1974 to 90, the MoH vigorously coor dinated and gave prominence to the activities and services of the ITM over the servi ces of traditional heal th practitioners. Such context created an impression that the governme nt abandoned the practitioners and disvalued their services. It further created endless comp laints from traditional health practitioners 78 JMT, Wizara C. Uiso and Edmund J. Kayombo, June 8, 2018, Institute of Traditional Medici ne (ITM). Uiso and Kayombo are senior researchers at the Institute. 80 demanding more support and cons iderations from the MoH.79 Fortunately, in February 1991, the MoH considered their demands and took severa l initiatives to coordi nate their activities. Among other things, it formally included traditiona l healers in its mainstream health service. The Minister for Health, Prof essor Philemon Sarungi, said: \"I am here to announce to you [traditional medicine practitione rs] that you are now a fully rec ognised sector an d my Ministry is now working to chart out guidelines and policies under which your activities would be coordinated nation-wide.\"80 Before the official recognition, traditional practitioners worked on an individual basis, and the MoH did not effectively coordinate the services offered with the rigor needed in the exercise of preventing and healing diseas es. From the 1990s, more tangible attempts were taken by the government to promote the use of traditional medicine parallel to biomedicine. The ITM owed to the support it received from the Chinese government. In 1991, the Minister for Health acknow ledged the support and affirmed that Tanzania was making headway on her research in traditional medicine because of the assist ance it received from the Chinese government.81 The institutionalisation of traditional medi cine pleased many Tanzanians who trusted traditional medicine more than biomedicine. Th e available research illuminates that many patients went to hospitals or clinics as a last resort, after traditional medicine had failed. Additionally, about 60% of the urban populatio n and over 80% of th e rural population in Tanzania relied on traditional medicine. Moreover , traditional health practitioners in Tanzania enjoyed a much more agreeable ratio of patients they attended to than biomedical doctors. The ratio of traditional health pract itioners was 1:500 patients while th at of biomedical doctors was 1:25,000 by 2012.82 These glimpses imply that traditi onal medicine contributed significantly to the development of primary health care in Ta nzania. They further show that sufficient use of traditional medicine was vital for the development of local medical knowledge, a key to the attainment of medical self-sufficiency. 79 Interview by Andrea Kifyasi with Edmund J.

Julius K. Nyerere.83 From Nyerere's quote, government priorities varied from one country to another. While rural health care was not a concern to some countries of the North, Nyerere's government made it a priority, mainly after the la unch of the Arusha Declaration in 1967, where social infrastructures such as health, schools, and water were entrenched in the concept of \"socialism and rural development\".84 The government recognised that a country's development depended on the welfare of its citizens; that is why it vowed to impr ove people's health by extending social services to rura l areas where the services were mostly lacking. The rural health care program was initially recommended in the Titmuss report of 1964, which showed that there were two to three trained doctors for every 100,000 people in rural areas by 1963. It recommended the post-colonial government to prio ritise staffing rural health centres to fight diseases effectively, curb rura l-urban migration and hasten ag ricultural production, which was the backbone of the country's economy. 85 However, it was since the Arusha Declaration of 1967 that the Tanzanian government took the rural health care agenda seriously. Tanzania's rural health care policy was co mparable to Chinese rural health care schemes. After the Revolution, Chairman Mao set up Four Health Principles, which became the basis for the development of health care. The first principle contended the necessity of medical and health works to serve workers, peas ants and soldiers. The second principle stressed preventive health care, while the third accented the unification of doctors of traditional and biomedicines. In the fourth prin ciple, Mao underscored the integrat ion of health work and mass movement.86 Rural health care was covered in the firs t principle, which underscored inclusive health care. Medical works such as prevention of diseases, clinical practices, scientific research and training of personnel had to proceed from se rving workers, peasants and soldiers, and not only a particular class of people. 83 Quoted in Nsekela and Nhonoli, The Development of Health Services and Society in Mainland Tanzania , 20. 84 Resnick, The Long Transition , 192. 85 See, for instance, Chapter 5 in Richard M. Titmuss, Brian Abel-Smith, George Macdonald, Arthur W. Williams, and Christopher H. Wood, The Health Services of Tanganyika: A Report to the Government (London: Pitman Medical Publishing, 1964), 106-107. 86 Wu Chieh-ping, \"For Workers, Peasants and Soldiers,\" Peking Review , no. 8, February 21, 1975, 9. 82 Several health campaigns, such as the Patriotic Health Campaign, which stressed preventive health care, were implemented by the government to fight diseases in urban and rural areas. Yet, the government attempts failed to improve rural health care. Up to the 1960s, diseases were rampant and rural communities lacked enough medical personnel, medicines, health centres, and medical equipment.87 Such challenges saddened Chairman Mao, who openly criticised the Ministry of Public Health for paying less attention to rural health care. Mao argued: Tell the Ministry of Public Health that it only works for fifteen per cent of the total population of the country and that this fifteen per cent is mainly composed of gentlemen, while the broad masses of the peasants do not get any medical treatment. First, they don't have any doctors; second, they don't have any medicine. The Ministry of Public Health is not a Ministry of Public Health for the people, so why not change its name to the Ministry of Urban Health, the Ministry of Gentlemen's Health, or even to Ministry of Urban Gentlemen's Health?88 By 1965, over 500 million of China's population were peasants. Given the fact that agricultural activit ies were the backbone of China's ec onomy, the emphasis on rural health care was imperative.89 Besides, Mao's rural health care ai med to bridge the gap between urban and rural conditions and make me dical health work serve the majority instead of a small percentage of the population. Mao underscored: \"We should leave behind in the city a few of the less able doctors who graduated one or two y ears ago, and the others should all go into the countryside.\"90 To adhere to Mao's better rural health care endeavour, the Ministry of Public Health had to transform the health care system to build a genuinely socialist health service that would contribute to the country's socialis t revolution. Subsequently, in 1966, following China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, cr owds of urban medical and health workers throughout the country were sent to rural areas to deliver me dical care to peasants and workers.91 Thus, from 1966 onwards, medical gradua tes were channelled to rural health 87 Zhou Xun, The People's Health: Health Intervention and Delivery in Mao's China, 1949-1983 (Montreal: McGill-Queen's Univers ity Press, 2020), 12. 88 Mao Tse-tung, \"Directive on Public Health, June 26, 1965,\" in Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung Volume IX , (India: Pragathi Book House, 1994), 216. 89 Hua Hsin, \"Chinese Factory's Long March from Dustpans to Hospital Equipment,\" Daily News , October 19, 1977, 4. 90 Mao, \"Directive on Public Health, June 26, 1965,\" 217. 91 Zhou, The People's Health, 192-193. 83 centres, dispensaries, and hospitals. For inst ance, by 1973, the Ministry of Public Health reallocated to rural areas mo re than 100,000 medical workers.92 Similarly, at independence, Tanzania had more than 90% of rural dwellers who depended on their survival from agricultural activities. The gove rnment noticed that investing in rural health care was key to bettering life fo r rural communities and the country at large. Consequently, Tanzania's economic destiny dwelle d heavily on peasants who were the primary producers of both food and cash crops. To prom ote peasants' product ion, the government, among others, extended health se rvices to their vicinities.93 Rural health services, therefore, constituted a crucial investment consistent wi th Nyerere's commitment to socialism and rural development, as well as his bio-political end eavour. The state anticipat ed that people would produce more if they were energetic and healthier. The Tanzanian government approached the ru ral health care program through a three- tier structure of personnel and facilities, consis ting of village health posts, dispensaries, and health centres. It considered villages as the ba sic unit of the health care system. Thus, it placed prime importance on village health care. Neverthele ss, the delivery of health care in rural areas was challenging. The main hurdles were rooted in the structure of the villages themselves. Rural communities were scattered and the volunt ary concentration of the scattered homesteads, administered from 1963 by the Rural Settlement Commission, was not prog ressing well. Up to 1965, only about 3,400 families resided in the newly established villages.94 Despite such noticed failure, the government found it necessary for people to live in organised settlements to facilitate rural development. Nyerere argued: \"We shall not be able to use tractors; we shall not be able to build hospitals or have clean drinking water; it will be quite impossible to start small village industries without a rural population living in villages.\" 95 Consequently, the government perceived villagization as the only f easible means of reaching economic and social development. Bringing together previously scattered co mmunities heightened after the Arusha Declaration, where through the Cooperative So cieties Act of 1968, the government encouraged the registration of the newly established settlements as Ujamaa villages. Such attempt 92 Wu, \"For Workers, Peas ants and Soldiers,\" 10. 93 Wilson Kaigarula, \"Taking Health Services to the People,\" Daily News , March 6, 1979, 4. 94 Kikula, Policy Implications on Environment , 21. 95 Kikula, Policy Implications on Environment , 14. 84 persuaded some communities to reside in the established villages, reaching a total of 300,000 people in about 650 villages by 1969. However, the pace was below the government's expectations. Thus, through the President Circular No. 1 of 1969, and Presidential decree of 1973, resettlement became compulsory, while th e government applied both coercive and persuasive means to make sure that all families reside in Ujamaa villages by the end of 1976.96 Coercive measures led to a violent confronta tion between villagers and the campaign teams in several places of the country. Such confrontat ion prompted numerous critics from scholars, associating villagization campa ign with the declining rura l economy throughout the 1970s.97 Despite the odds, the villagization campa ign was an essential means of putting communities together to facilitate the provision of social services. This view implies that the campaign brought both hardships and opportuniti es to the rural communities. President Nyerere, in his report to the Tanganyika African Nationa l Union (TANU) conference of September 1973, made this clear: \"It is one th ing to leave a tiny, sun-baked, and waterless shamba in Dodoma District and move into a ne w village where water is or soon will be, available and elementary medical and educational facilities are being c onstructed for the first time.\"98 Nyerere anticipated that rural dwellers would benefi t more under the villagization scheme since the government woul d extend all necessary social se rvices to them. However, the resettlement scheme was not supported by the will of the majority in many parts of the country. Some rural communities perceived the scheme as a form of dislocation and loss since they were forced to move away from their residences in which they had heavily invested for years. Others accepted it wholeheartedly, perceiving the resettlement as an oppor tunity to get access to social services and a better li fe as promised by political elites. 99 Nevertheless, the promised social infrastruc tures such as schools, roads, and health centres were established by villagers themselves through a \"self-help\" spirit, with minimal backing from the government. Nyerere put this clear that: \"People must be helped to understand that they will get the better services in the Ujamaa Villages because they will be able to work together to create them; it must be wi th this understanding that they join.\"100 Up to 1983, about 96 Kikula, Policy Implications on Environment , 22; URT, Second Five-Year Plan for Economic and Social Development July 1, 1969-June 30, 1 974, Volume I: General Analysis, 1969 . 97 Read, for instance, Chuhila, \"Agrarian Change and Rural Transformation in Tanzania,\" 13; Andrew Coulson, Tanzania a Political Economy (New York: Oxford University Press, 1982), 168-176; also see Scott, Seeing Like a State , 223-261; Lawi, \"Tanzania's Operation Vijiji,\" 73. 98 Julius K.

The government development plans were structured according to the rural health care program. For example, in the Second Five Year Development Plan, it stressed on the preventive health services through the ag ency of rural health centres. The government anticipated establishing health centres throughout the countr y. It aimed to attain the ratio of one health centre to every 50,000 people. With this target, the government needed to establish 240 health centres to meet the demands of the whole countr y. Besides the supervision of dispensaries in their respective areas, health centres were also responsible for organising preventive campaigns, such as nutrition education, environm ental sanitation, maternal and child health services and immunisation.102 Under the Second Plan, the government further proposed to establish enough rural dispensaries as it endeavoure d to reach a ratio of a single dispensary to every 10,000 people. The government achieved its target by increasing de velopment capital in the health sector from 2.2% allocated in the First Five Year Development Plan to 8% in the Second Five Year Development Plan. 103 The government plans were realistic sin ce the budget for the Ministry of Health increased from Tshs. 8,538,000 in the 1971/72 financial year to Tshs. 14,198,000 in the 1973/74. While in 1971, there were a bout 87 rural health centres, by the end of 1973, the number of centres in creased to 135. Likewise, the number of dispensaries rose from 1,445 in 1971 to 1,594 in 1973. 104 Furthermore, in the 1977/78 financial year, the government allocated Tshs. 15,800,000 for the completion of new ru ral health centres and dispensaries in different regions of Tanzania. The allocated funds were ad ditional to Tshs. 18,590,000, spent in the 1976/77 financial year for the same purpose. The government 's target was to establish at least 10 to 15 rural health centres and 40 to 50 dispensaries per year.105 The 1970s and 80s were economically challenging periods for the Tanzanian government. It experienced droughts, the oil crisis and 101 \"World Drug Market Manual, November 19, 1982,\" TN A. Acc.

Despite the mentioned challenges, th e government was devoted to improving health services, particularly in rural areas. Subsequent ly, it directed more funds to the rural health care. Table 4 shows that between 1971 to 80, the gove rnment's shares in ru ral health services rose from 20% to 42%. The government's commitment in allocating more funds for rural health care aimed to meet deliberations by its Sec ond Five Year Development Plan where it anticipated to establish about 80 rural health centres in va rious districts of Tanzania. 106 Despite the evidence that the government allocated consider able funds for rural health care, the actual implementation of the program needed more funds, medicines, medical equipment, and personnel, which were not readily availabl e. Such inadequacies curtailed the sound achievements of the project.

The establishment of the rural health posts and dispensaries we nt hand in hand with the staffing program. At independence, most rura l health posts in Tanzania lacked trained medical personnel. Such a situation too existed in China. At liberation, China had only about 20,000 doctors trained in the western medical sc hools who mostly worked in urban areas. Its villagers depended mainly on traditional Chinese medicine practitioners.107 After the Revolution, Chairman Mao established several st rategies to create a healthy community, which would engage fully in production and bring a su ccessful socialistic revolution in agriculture, industry, and science. Mao stressed the improveme nt of health facilities throughout the country while providing priority to rural areas where the majority of people lived.

The scheme was famously known as \"First Aid-Kit Scheme\", and was run by Village Medical Helpers (VMHs). The scheme aimed to pr ovide health care to villages which had not had health centres since the col onial era. Through village health posts, the scheme intended to obviate the need for a journey of more than 20 to 30 miles for the people seeking health services. Moreover, village health posts antic ipated reducing considerably the number of outpatients attending for comparatively trivial a ilments at regional and district hospitals. It further aimed to get enough health practitioners to address villag e health challenges. Moreover, the scheme intended to empower and encourage vill agers to help themselves in the early stages of addressing health challenges. Through the sc heme, the government anticipated that VMHs would address common and non-complicated health challenges. The government aimed to have at least two VMHs (one male and a female) in each village. Local administrations employed VMHs who worked for their respective ethnic groups or belonged to the same ethnic group as that of the area in which they were to be employed. By 1974, the government had trained 2,218 VMHs who were working in the villages throughout the country. 109 Generally, VMHs supplemented long-trained medical staff who we re fewer to cater to the needs of the government. The name \"village nedical helpers\" was analogous with the British colonial \"tribal of 1925 and the Chinese \"barefoot doctors\"111 (ch\u00ecjio yshng) of 1965 in 108 \"Report on a visit of Ministry of Health delegation to the People's Republic of China, September 1977,\" TNA.

O. Shircore, in 1925. The scheme trained mainly lower medical personnel assigned roles to address common local diseases in their respective villages. 111 Before using the term \"barefoot do ctors\", the term \"peoples commune\" was used which meant a lower cadre of medical personnel working in communes. The term \"baref oot doctors\" was later given as a certificate to youths providing clinical care to the communes. The name came from Southern farmers who often worked barefoot in the rice paddy fields. The government recruited such lower medical cadre from a group of youths who received minimal training in treating minor illnesses, immunisation, environmental sanitation, and other preventive 88 structure and practice. Findings from the pres ent study show that the Tanzanian government utilised both experiences it learned from the Br itish and the Chinese. The delegates from MoH sent to China for a study tour le arned that the Chinese government strived to improve its health services by providing short training programs to its medical personnel.112 Short training courses enabled the country to have a large number of medical personnel. For instance, up to 1977, it had about 4,000,000 barefoot doctors.113 Chinese achievements in staffing rural health centres were, therefore, admired and adopted by the Tanzanian government. The VMHs scheme trained lower medical pe rsonnel. The training was elementary and chiefly confined to the treatment of common local diseases. District medical officers (DMOs) were responsible for executing the training program.114 The course lasted a minimum of three months. The training sessions we re held in their respective di stricts and regional hospitals. Training for VMHs included lectures on basic an atomy and general medicine subjects, mother and child welfare, village government's political structure, environmental sanitation, food and nutrition, and knowledge on undesirable customs and beliefs that had a bearing on village health. For example, some communities forb ade pregnant women and children from eating some varieties of foodstuffs such as eggs, lead ing to severe malnourishment for both the mother and child. 115 The three-month training also included a management course that aimed to acquaint trainees with managerial sk ills to control village health posts.116 The government expected that trainees would be in a position to deal effectively with the average assortment of rural sick and that they would do a certain amo unt of treatment of mino r ailments, render first aid, and act as collecting agents for the hospitals (Figure 4).117 Furthermore, VMHs had to provide at least minimal preventive and curative services to the villages without a dispensary or health centre and connect thei r respective villages to the offici al chain of referrals if more skilled services other than simple village- based were required.

However, the post- colonial Tanzanian government improved the se lection process by training village leaders regarding rural health care and their roles as employers of the VMHs. The village leaders consulted villagers and recommended four na mes (two males and two females). Eligible persons were required to be: permanent resident s in the village, liked and respected by all, married and/or owned a durable house and farm in the village, married and living together with a spouse, aged between 25 and 45 years, and a diligent member of the Tanganyika African National Union (TANU). 119 Additionally, applicants were required to hold a minimum standard of primary education. Primary school graduates with sufficient knowledge and ability to read and write well in Kiswahili, with a wo rking knowledge of English, were considered in priority. To commit VMHs to the service, the gov ernment demanded that they fill in agreement forms committing them to serve the village for at least five years after completion of their training. 120 Most of the criteria used by the post-colonial Tanzanian government to admit eligible candidates for the VMHs program resembled those used by the British colonial government. Similarly, the criteria resembled and differed from those used to select barefoot doctors in China. For instance, the Chinese government considered trainees with secondary school certificates. Such qualification allowed trainees to advance their medical education and get promoted to village medical doctors. In the 1980s, when the barefoot doctors' scheme collapsed, some barefoot doctors went for furt her training and got empl oyed as village medical doctors. 121 The selection of secondary school graduate s would not work both in colonial and post-colonial periods in Tanzania since ther e were very few secondary school graduates.122 As a result, the British recruitment system, which was embraced by the post-colonial Tanzanian 119 \"F.

Like the British tribal dressers, the VMHs scheme acquainted trainees with notions of biomedicine. Such a training system contrasted with that in which the Chinese prepared trainees in both biomedicine and traditional Ch inese medicine. The Chinese training system was in line with the Maoist policies, which st ressed integrating biomedicine and traditional medicine in health care.123 Archival records show that be fore the opening up of dressing stations in colonial Tanganyika, biomed icine was prevalent in only a few towns.124 Therefore, dressing stations played a vital role in popularising biomedic ine to the interior of Tanganyika. Similarly, the negligence in training VMHs in traditional Tanzanian medicine played a role in popularising biomedicine in rural areas. The post-colonial Tanzanian government wa s dedicated to promoting preventive health care. Under its First Five Year Development Plan of 1964 -69, the government prioritised both preventive and curative measures. It realised that many health challenges such as bilharzia, diarrhoea, malari a, hookworm, malnutrition, enteri c infection and the like were preventable. Thus, it stressed vaccination and health education. The gove rnment premised that preventive knowledge would spread to people through health education. Accordingly, the MoH circulated knowledge on the significance of wear ing shoes, digging and using latrines, proper attention to nutrition, and cl eanliness (Chapters 1 and 5).125 The government perceived VMHs as an effective means of transmitting preventive knowledge to villagers. Lessons related to health education, essential immunisations, clean and adequate water, e nvironmental sanitation, standard housing, adequate and balanced diet, control of major endemic diseases, mother and child services, family planni ng, and secondary prev ention of diseases and injuries were imparted to the trainees to meet the gove rnment's ambitions. The stress on preventive education was consistent with the barefoot doctors' scheme, which also extended preventive medical knowledge to trainees for the same purpose. 126 123 Xiaoping Fang, \"Changing Narratives and Persistin g Tensions: Conflicts Between Chinese and Western Medicine and Professional Profiles in Ch inese Films and Literature, 1949-2009,\" Medical History 63, no. 4 (2019): 463. 124 \"Organisation of Rural Medical Work in the Western Pr ovince,\" TNA.

The status of the stations varied from one province to the next, depending on financial ability.127 Similarly, the Chinese barefoot doctors were stationed in simple health units established by villagers and their local governments on a self-help basis. 128 Likewise, the post-coloni al Tanzanian government, through its district and village o fficers, organised villagers to establish simple buildings and used them as village health posts. Such initia tives were in line with the 1964 Titmuss report, which recommended the government to involve villagers in community development programmes in the spirit of \"self-help\", to improve health care serv ices at the grassroots level.129 The Titmuss suggestions were backed by the Presidential Circular No. 2 of 1968 which subjected all minor community developmen t projects such as schools, dispensaries, community centres, teacher 's house and the like to a \"self-help scheme\".130 Such attempts show government initiatives to empower people to use the resources and skills they jointly possessed for their welfare and development. The government supported self-help pr ojects with technical advice, roofing materials, pipe s and other capital assistance.131 At the same time, the village community furnished village health posts with simple facilities such as a table and chairs. Moreover, village governments covere d travelling costs for the helper s to enable them to travel to health centres and collect drugs and equipment. Additi onally, the village governments exempted the helpers from other village develo pment activities such as road construction, cultivating Ujamaa farms and the like, to enable them to deliver medical services effectively.132 VMHs received monthly allowances fr om their respective village government councils, similar to the British tribal dressers and Chinese barefoot doctors.

In some places, barefoot doctors received peasant's share, just like other peasants wo rking on farms while in other provinces the resident of each commune paid on e to two yuan per year as allowance for the doctors. Thus, patients received c linical care free of charge. U nder this system, China had two groups of medical workers: th e ones who were paid by the government and those who were paid by communes. Such dual practice reduced the central government's expenditure and enhanced people's access to health care.133 Though details showing the amounts of monthly allowances received by VMHs are missing, villag e governments were obligated to enforce fee collection and surely saw to it.134 Investments in rural health care required both political will and financial ability. Political elites in Tanzania were determined to seeing rural health care scheme become a success. However, the country's ill economic situ ation was the main hindrance. To address the financial deficit, the Tanzanian government re quested and received support from different donors. Although the Chinese government influenced the government to establish a village health care scheme, funding for the scheme did not flow much from China. Instead, the scheme was backed by the Basel Foundation for Aid to Developing Countries and other traditional donors of the North. The Basel Foundation provi ded 1,000,000 Swiss francs for buildings and the equipment of the Rural Aid Centre (RAC) at Ifakara in 1961. It also donated 200,000 francs annually to run the cour se and to develop and maintain the centre. 135 The RAC trained low medical cadres, such as rural medical aids and assistant medical officers. However, following the government needs of VMHs, it adjusted its training to meet the demand.136 The United Nations International Children's Emergency Fu nd (UNICEF) and the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) also sponsored the programme. The Swedish government, for instance, signed an agreement in May 1973 whereby it committed to donating 35 million Swedish kronor to Tanzania's disposal to support the develo pment of rural health services during the fiscal years 1972/73 to 1976/77.137 Furthermore, village medical helpers 133 \"Report on a visit of Ministry of Health delegation to the People's Republic of China, September 1977,\" TNA.

In 1976, for instance, about 56 bicycles were distributed to the helpers working in Dodoma, Li ndi, Mbeya, and Mtwara. The VMHs who served scattered Ujamaa villages were the first to receive bicycles.138 Bicycles helped them to reach many rural patients on time. Despite the order from the Minister Ally Hassan Mwinyi in 1972, directing medical graduates to work in rural dispensaries, unfa vourable living and working conditions dissuaded many candidates.139 Therefore, up to 1977, VMHs dominated health care delivery in rural health posts, while most of the medical gradua tes worked in towns and cities. This context created the impression that medical staffs with short training were de stined for rural areas, while qualified medical doctors were for towns and cities.140 In September 1977, the Minister for Health, Leader Stirling, issued another order to force medical graduates to work in rural areas for some years before they ap ply for allocation to towns and cities.141 Subsequently, many doctors were relocated to rural areas following th e Ministry's order (Tab le 5). The Ministry's decisions were consistent with the recommendations made by de legates of the MoH who went to China for a study tour. The delegates real ised that by 1965, the Chinese government mobilised thousands of Chinese doctors from town s and cities and re-allocated them in rural areas to prevent diseases, treat people, and transmit preventive health education to rural communities. These delegates recommended that the government should improve the living and working environments to convince medical graduates to work in rural health centres. 142 138 \"UNICEF, Plan of Operations for Development of Pub lic Health Services (DPHS) in the United Republic of Tanzania, Interim Addendum for Development of Basi c Health Services, July, 1991,\" WHOA, File No. TANZANIA/UNICEF-5, 1968-1972-SHS, Development of Pu blic Health Services; \"Letter from the Principal Secretary, Ministry of Health, August 26, 1976 to Development Directors, Mtawanyo wa Kwanza kwa Wahudumiaji wa 1965-1982. 139 Kifyasi with Gallus Namangaya Abedi, June 6, 2018, Posta-Dar es Salaam.

Government's decisions to force medical gra duates to work in rural areas intended to level the unequal distribution of medical workers in rural and urban areas as shown in Table 5. From colonial to post-colonial periods, urban dwellers who constituted less than 10% of the total population enjoyed a more s ophisticated type of health se rvice. At the same time, the remaining majority endured inadequate health service with short-time trained medical personnel. 143 Before government efforts to prioritise rural health care, the national health system was structured like a pyramid, where by well-equipped hospitals, research centres, specialist doctors, and a uxiliary medical facilities were situated in big cities. At the bottom, however, there were several districts, each with district hospitals and health centres, lacking basic facilities. Consequently, achieving equitable health care required the MoH 's commitment to reconsidering how its limited resour ces could better serve rural areas. Despite the merits, the VMH scheme faced se veral problems, such as the inadequate funding by the local authorities (employers), whic h threatened its very survival. Some village governments did not provide monthly allo wances and other incentives to VMHs.144 The lack of allowances and incentives influenced some VMHs to look for potential jobs in towns.

Following the crisis, the government lacked enough foreign currency to purchase medicines and medical equipment. Such contex t hindered health care delivery by the VMHs.146 Additionally, some rural communities mistru sted health services offered by VMHs. Gallus Namangaya Abedi asserts that some villag ers worried when they were approached by a helper dressed in trousers and a shirt, rather th an the crisp white coats worn by doctors (Figure 4). Similarly, they were shunned by and isolated from the learned medical staffs who perceived them as incompetent cadres.147 Such challenges discouraged VM Hs engagement in the delivery of health care in rural communities. Consequent ly, from the 1980s and 90s, the VMHs scheme lost its relevance since it l acked effective management a nd community support. Like for China's barefoot doctors, the cost-sharing po licy, which emerged in the 1990s, buried VMHs scheme in Tanzania. The free health care serv ices provided by VMHs declined. Thus, a few remaining VMHs turned to other professions.148 The rural health care scheme implemente d by the Tanzanian government became the cornerstone of the international conference on primary health care (PHC) held at Alma-Ata (Almaty), Kazakhstan, in September 1978. The conf erence made a declaration to meet the health needs of people throughout the world. The declaration identified VMHs as one of the foundational cornerstones of having a comprehe nsive PHC, a programme that would be a global strategy for achieving \"Health For All\" by 2000.149 Tanzania was in an advantageous position since, even before the Alma-Ata conference, it had already in place a well-structured health care system from the grassroots level fo r more than a decade.

Socialist principles spearh eaded the equa lity of man, preservation of life and health , which were also included in the Alma-Ata declaration. The PHC program, which the MoH implemented after th e Alma-Ata conference, incorporated more than 2000 VMHs who were working throughout the country.151 The preceding assertions imply that the Tanzanian government practised the \"Health For All\" agenda before the 1978 conference. Nevertheless, after the Alma-Ata conference, it re viewed and updated its health care delivery system to conform with the PHC. 2.6 Banning Private Health Services Practice, 1977-1992 Although the Tanzanian government vowed to maintain equality among its citizens to conform to socialist ideology, it retained the 1958's privat e practice policy endorsed by the colonial government. The policy left a room for the operation of the private domiciliary practice, consulting practice and special procedures. 152 Under private domiciliary practices, a patient had the choice of attending either gove rnment-owned health centres or private ones. The policy allowed people and organisations to own and practice private hospitals. There were a few private health service centres during the British colonial period, but their number would explode after independence. For instance, by 1973, there were about 32 private health centres in Dar es Salaam alone, many owned by Tan zanians, Indians and the British. Private institutions were also establ ished up-country and were mostly owned by Indians, Tanzanians, Italians, British, Kenyans, Aust ralians, Pakistanis, and Swiss.153 Thus, private health services functioned parallel to government-owned hospita ls. Above all, while the number of health facilities under private practitioners was lower than the number of institutions provided by the government (Table 4), their doctors were almost half of the total number of doctors in the 150 Rose Kalemera, \"Well Done Tanzania, Says WHO Chief,\" Daily News , July 27, 1987, 1. 151 \"J.

For instance, in 1961, ther e were 419 registered doctors in the country, of whom about 239 were in government service, wh ile 180 were in private practices.154 This context seems to indicate that patients attending pr ivate health services were likely to get more effective health care compared to those who a ttended the government service. Private practitioners spread mostly in to wn and cities, hence, widening the medical services gap between urban and rural dwellers. People in urban areas enjoyed efficient health services from both the government and private pr actitioners. Since profit maximisation was the determining factor in establishing private practice s, towns and cities were preferred over rural areas. As private practices paid high wages to their medical workers, they likewise attracted more medical graduates. Amon Nsekela and Al oysius Nhonoli write that out of 30 dentists only ten worked in governme nt or volunteer agencies.155 The survival of private pract itioners under the so cialist regime was uncertain. In the 1970s, the Tanzanian government realised that priv ate practitioners were inconsistent with its socialist ideology. Therefore, in 1977 the parliamentary procedur es of banning the practice of private health services were tabled. Recommend ations made by delegates of medical workers who went to China for a study tour backed the banning agenda. The de legates learned that under socialist policies, the Chinese governme nt had prohibited private practitioners.156 The recommendations were an eye-opene r to political elites as they realised that ten years after Tanzania had opted for so cialism, one professional field was yet to be effec tively touched by the country's socialist endeavours to erad icate exploitation in its many and varied ramifications. Before the ban, private medical pr actitioners in Tanzania enjoyed, so to speak, the heaven of their own, notw ithstanding complaints that they highly exploited low-income patients.157 Both politicians and ordinary citizens demanded the outlawing of private health services in Tanzania. Socialist allies wanted priv ate health institutions to be closed to allow the government to practice fu lly socialist policies.158 While supporters of socialism demanded the closure of the private health pr actitioners, other citizens argued against it, maintaining that 154 Nsekela and Nhonoli, The Development of Health Services and Society in Mainland Tanzania , 79. 155 Nsekela and Nhonoli, The Development of Health Services and Society in Mainland Tanzania , 80. 156 \"Report on a visit of Ministry of Health delegation to the People's Republic of China, September 1977,\" TNA.

They further backed the fact that the services offered by private health practitioners were effec tive and quick compared to public health services. The other point opposing the ban was that the government ha d inadequate health se rvice centres; thus, banning private services would complicate health care delivery. In this view, the government needed to promote the establishment of more private health services by local and foreign investors instead of banning them.159 Surely, the government health centres were overcrowded and provided inadequate services due to an acute shortage of medical personnel and limited resources. Yet, conflicting views from pro-soci alism and anti-socialism groups were inevitable, given the fact that the ban came at the height of Cold War politics. Notwithstanding the contribution of private h ealth services and the peoples' divergent opinions over their presence, the government regarded it as necessa ry to ban their practices to attain equality in service delivery and fulfil the \"Health For All\" agenda. Theoretically, the idea was revolutionary in the sense that it premis ed to provide free medical services to all Tanzanians. Allies of socialism accused private hos pitals of delivering health services to a particular class of people who afforded the expe nses. They further alleged owners of private hospitals of persuading well-trained doctors work ing in public hospitals to retire prematurely and join their hospitals with the promise of higher salaries.160 Furthermore, the government claimed that private medical practitioners were more con cerned with making money than providing services to patients. The Minister for Health cautio ned: \"It is not good that anybody should make [a] private prof it out of human suffering.\"161 The government suspected public medical staff members of stea ling medicines and selling them to private hospitals and apothecaries.162 The government anticipated that outlawi ng private hospitals would eventually address the outlined shortcomings. Prohibiting the practice of priv ate health practices had all the blessings of President Nyerere, who regularly maintained that health was not an appropriate sector for profit-making and private hospitals were inconsistent with the socialist policies cherished by his regime.163 159 K.

Nyerere, on 20th October, 1982 at Diamond Jubilee Hall, Dar es Salaam , 27. 100 Thus, influences from the Chinese government as well as pressure from political elites and ordinary citizens were behind the ban on th e practice of private health services. The long-time outcry to end the practice of private health services ended up in 1977 after the government had signed the Private Ho spital (Regulation) Act. Under the Act, the Tanzanian government made it illegal for any indi vidual or organisation to manage or cause to be managed any private hospital except on behalf of an approved organisation.164 Up to 1977, more than 20% of doctors were working in pr ivate health sectors. Thus, restricting the operation of private health servi ces was, from one perspective, the government's initiative to bring more doctors to th e public health sector. After the clos ure of private hea lth centres, the government convinced medical workers from privat e sectors to join the national health service and pledged to buy all medical equipment and related facilities used by the expelled hospitals.165 Nevertheless, the ban did not touch some private health centres owned by non-profit Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), mostly under religious institutions. Retaining them was not only the concern of polit ical elites but also of the or dinary citizens. The government maintained non-profit health practitioners si nce they charged relatively low fees and sometimes, they offered free health care to low-income families. Non-profit health practitioners charged low fees since they r eceived most of their medicines and medical equipment in the form of aid. 166 Yet, not all private practitioners under NGOs got approval certificates to operate. Under th e 1977 Act, the MoH stipulated criteria for the approval of organisations to run private health services. A ccording to the Act, religious and non-religious organisations were eligible for approval if: they had as objects the advancement of religion, or, they were established for the promotion of the welfare of workers and peasants, or they were engaged in the advancement of any other public purpose. 167 The Minister for Health had a mandate to disapprove or cancel approval certificates of any organisation which engaged or intended to engage in the management of private health services to make profit or promote the economic interests of the members of the 164 \"URT, The Private Hospitals (Regulation) Act of 1977,\" MwRC, File No. M.10/1, Medical and Health, Medical Policy and Instructions, 1. 165 \"World Drug Market Manual, November 19, 1982,\" TN A.

Any person who managed unregistered private health servic es was guilty of an offence a nd was liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding Tshs. 50,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years, or to both fine and imprisonment.169 Despite the ban, there remained a considerab le number of private health institutions which supplemented government health services . The 1992 World Bank sta tistics show that by 1988, NGOs owned about 96 hospitals while government hospitals amounted to 74. However, the government outnumbered NGOs in health centres and dispensaries. Sta tistics show that it had 266 health centres and 2205 dispensaries by 1988 while NGOs owned 11 health centres and about 730 dispensaries in the same period (Table 6). 170 However, the ban on the practice of pr ivate health services did not survive liberalisation. The 1986 structural adjustme nt programmes (SAPs), which the Tanzanian government signed with the IMF, forced the government to al low private investment in economic and social sectors. From 1986 on, seve ral internal and external campaigns demanded the resumption of the operation of private health services in Tanzania. For example, the Medical Association of Tanzania (MAT), tir elessly lobbied the government to allow the operation of private health practitioners.171 Eventually, in 1991, th e government resumed the operation of private health services following th e passing of the Private Hospitals (Regulation) (Amendment) Act. Under this Ac t, the government allowed qualif ied medical practitioners and dentists to manage private health faci lities with the approval of the MoH.172 The lift of the embargo led to a boom in private health servi ces in Tanzania. For example, up to 1995, there were more than 300 private clinics and hospitals in Dar es Salaam. Above all, many private apothecaries extended to diffe rent parts of the country.173 168 \"URT, The Private Hospitals (Regulation) Act of 1977,\" MwRC, File No. M.10/1, Medical and Health, Medical Policy and Instructions, 2. 169 \"URT, The Private Hospitals (Regulation) Act of 1977,\" MwRC, File No. M.10/1, Medical and Health, Medical Policy and Instructions, 3. 170 World Bank Report, Tanzania AIDS Assessment and Planning Study , June 1992, 7. 171 Interview by Andrea Kifyasi with Joseph W.

The discussions showed that, between 1966 and 1977, the MoH sent delegations of medical expe rts to study China's health system. Recommendations made by these envoys reinforced the government's decisions to practice free health care policy, institutionalise tr aditional medicine, rura l health care, and ban private health service practices. The gove rnment, however, did not copy the policies uncritically. Instead, these were learnt and applied based on the country's economic and social situation. To some extent, the post-colonial government moulded some colonial health practices to conform to the soci alist path. Inspired by China's parallel endeavour to pursue a distinct socialist path, Tanzanian authorities adopted socialis t health policies and bolstered their 103 relationship with China. As the example of health policies shows, China's influence was not limited to direct transfers of resources and know ledge. Rather, the country also served as an inspiration \"from the South\" in less direct ways. This chapter has foregrounded the understanding of other means of China's medical assistance to Tanzania, which are the subject of the subsequent chapters. 105 CHAPTER THREE: ANGELS OF GOD? UNPACKING THE HISTORY AND ROLES OF CHINESE MEDICAL TEAMS IN TANZANIA, 1968-2010 3.1 Introduction [Chinese medical doctors] made new contributions to the friendship between the two countries, by inheriting and carrying forward th e spirit of \"being fearless of hardship and dedicated to heal the wounded and rescue the dying with boundless love.\" [. . .] [U]pholding the international humanitarian spirit, the Government of China has assigned medical teams to Tanzania for nearly half a century, which has played [a significant] [. . .] role in sharing advanced medical experiences, providing medical equipment and medicine, improving Tanzania's health care capacity, promoting the development of medical and health undertaking of Tanzania, as well as consolidating friendship between the two countries. The Chinese doctors were honoured by Tanzanian pe ople as \"Angel[s] of God\" and \"Angel[s] in White\", which is a good paraphrase for the long-standing friendship between China and Tanzania. 1 Wang Ke, Ambassador of China to Tanzania, Dar es Salaam, November 3, 2017 The preceding quotation recapitulates the ro les and perceptions of Chinese medical teams (CMTs) in Tanzania from the point of view of the Chinese Ambassador. It shows that besides clinical care, the CMTs worked as medi cal trainers and diplomats. Yet, there is a relatively small body of literature that is concer ned with the activities and varying roles of CMTs in Africa. Several scholars studied the activ ities of the CMTs on the continent in a rather general manner - lacking a country-wise da ta approach, thus leavi ng many open and specific questions unattended.2 They have generally examined, for instance, the contexts behind the 1 A speech by H. E. Wang Ke, Ambassador of China to Tanzania, at the Farewell Reception for the 24th Chinese Medical Team in Tanzania, Dar es Salaam, November 3, 2017. 2 The CMT program's history in Africa is even longer than five decades, ye t specific and systematic historical studies are missing.

While the previous ch apter showed indirect ways in which the Chinese government assisted the Tanzanian governme nt through exposure to its health policies, this chapter studies China's direct form of a ssistance using the CMT program as its focal point. This chapter examines the history of CMTs in Tanzania from 1968 to 2010. It shows that Africa was the first frontier for the Chinese government to exercise medical assistance before its extension to other continents. This chapter de picts the change and continuities of China's foreign policy and its implications for the CM T program. Furthermore, it discusses several means of medical knowledge excha nges and their roles in building the capacity of the health sector in Tanzania. The roles of the CMTs em broiled within the Chinese government's foreign policy, which cast their activities as humanitarian.3 Nevertheless, I argue that the CMT program was a humanitarian mission, but at the same time driven by political and economic calculations. The program functioned as a soft way of secu ring allies during the Cold War era and a vital tool in maintaining Chin a's political and economic interests in Africa. At the same time, the ways in which the CMT program unfolded in Tan zania, did translate into modest increases in sustainability and self-depende ncy in its health sector. 3.2 A History of Chinese Medical Teams in Africa Chinese medical teams in Africa have a long history. To a large degree, this was the first assistance that the Chinese government bega n to offer to the African continent. CMTs started first in Algeria in 1963 as a result of the Algerian government's requests in 1962 following similar requests to Northern countries and the Red Cross. Algeria's requests came after experiencing rapidly deteriorating health services following the withdrawal of French medical staff soon after the liberation war in 1962. The 1963 dispatch of Chinese doctors to Algeria marked the beginning of the Chinese gov ernment's medical assistance to Africa, Latin America, Asia, Oceania and Southern Europe.4 3 A Speech by H. E. Wang Ke, Ambassador of China to Tanzania, November 3. 2017. 4 The Republic of Malta, a Southern European country, is the only European nation receiving CMTs. Malta, which signed diplomatic relations with China in 1972, has been receiving medical teams from Jiangsu province for more than 25 years to the present. Unlike countries of the South, China's medical aid to Malta is neither relief nor charity since Malta's health system is quite strong. China' s medical aid, therefore, ai med at bolstering diplomatic relations between the two countries and mostly boosting the practice of traditional Chinese medicine. By 2014, the Jiangsu province dispatched about 11 batches with a to tal of 66 medical doctors. See, for instance, Li Bo, et al., \"The Development of China's Medical Assistance Based on Jiangsu Province's Medical Aid to Malta and Zanzibar: Review and Suggestions,\" Chinese Journal of Disaster Medicine 6, no. 3 (March 2018): 122; 107 The CMT program was among several frontiers of China's medical assistance to Africa. Other frontiers that preoccupied medical teams included building hospital infrastructures. This category involved the c onstruction of hospitals, donation of drugs and medical equipment. Further categories included the construction of pharmaceutical factories, training of health personnel and control of malari a. The lack of sufficie nt medical personnel in many African countries made the CMT categor y a more interventioni st form of medical assistance than the rest. Therefore, the larges t share of China's health aid was spent on the CMTs.5 The Chinese government recruited medical workers from different provinces, where each province dispatched medical workers to one or more African countries (Table 7). Thus, the local government sent the teams abroad while the central government, through its Ministry of Public Health, administered the program. A single medical team usually comprised members from different medical departments such as physicians, surg eons, gynaecologists, ophthalmologists, acupuncturists, pharmacists, radiologists, labora tory technicians, anaesthesiologists, and nurses. The team also included cook s for Chinese food and language translators. In total, a single team had between 15 and 25 or more people, and each of them worked for two years.6 From 1963 to 1978, the Chinese govern ment carried mostly the costs for maintaining medical teams, while recipient countries carried a fraction of it. The Chinese government met costs for language training, food, salaries, medicines, and transport, while recipient countries provided the team with medical facilities, medical instruments, accommodation as well as security.7 After the first CMT mission to Algeria, other African countries received CMTs in consecutive years. For instance, up to the e nd of the 1960s, about seven African countries received CMTs.8 There was an increase in the number of CMTs to Africa between 1970 and 1978, whereby about 22 African countries received CMTs (Table 7).9 The increase in the number went concurrently with the rise of African countries which signed for diplomatic \"Diplomatic Relations Established Between China and Malta,\" Peking Review 15, no. 9, March 3, 1972, 3; Li, \"From 'How Could' to 'How Should,' 41, also Shuang et. al , \"China's Health A ssistance to Africa: Opportunism Health , 1. https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-016-0217-1 . 5 Peilong Liu, et al., \"China's Distinctive Engagement in Global Health,\" Lancet 308 (August 2014): 795. 6 Interview by Andrea Kifyasi with Ge Yonghe, March 1, 2016, Jinan.

China's medical assist ance to African countries further increased in the 1970s following the support African countries provided to China in its admission to the UN Assembly in 1971.10 However, the dispatch of the CMTs ch anged drastically in the 1970s following China's reform and opening-up policy. For example, from 1978, China's foreign policy focused more on economic than ideological and political relations, than was the case for the Maoist regime.11 China's assistance to Africa dropped not onl y in the health sector but also in economic terms. During this period, government intervention focused primarily on internal economic reconstruction rather than expansion ab road, hence affecting former beneficiaries of Chinese assistance.12 For example, from 1979 to 1980, some former African recipients ceased to receive medical assistance. Also, by 1980, al most 60% of the CMT beneficiary countries were required to share costs to bring and sustain CMTs in thei r countries. As a result, some beneficiaries failed while others managed to uphold the CMTs for a short time. All this translated into a marked deficit of medical personnel and complicated the delivery of health care in their countries. Worse s till, China did not sign new cont racts with any African country from 1988 to 1994, which meant it lost interest in extending medical assi stance abroad. Lastly, medical teams started to charge fees to patie nts. The charges implicated that the Chinese government attached economic benefits to the CMT program. Thus, they reflected China's market-oriented economic reforms, as the government transformed the CMT into a profit-making project. 13 This decline did not stay for long. From 1981 to 1987, the Chinese government sent teams to about ten countries (Table 7). After a freeze of almost six years (1988 -1994), medical teams began to flow from 1994, when Namibia, the Comoro Islands, and Lesotho received medical doctors for the first time.14 The medical teams, however, retreated from countries with political instabilities. For example, in 1991 a nd 97, the Chinese government withdrew teams 10 Li, Chinese Medical Coop eration in Africa, 9. 11 Yanzhong Huang, \"Pursuing Health as Foreign Policy: The Case of China,\" Indiana Journal of Global Legal Studies 17, no. 1 (Winter, 2010): 111; Li Anshan, \"China's New Policy toward Africa,\" in China into Africa, Trade, Aid, and Influence, ed.

Moreover, as well as from African countries which signed diplomatic relationships with Taiwan. Countries such as Liberia in 1989, Burkina Faso in 1994, and the Gambia in 1995, as well as Sao Tome and Principe in 1997, did not receive CMTs because they recognised Taiwan. The diplomatic rifts between China and Taiwan amplified the withdrawal of the CMTs. The teams to Libe ria resumed in 2005 after the country restored diplomatic relations with China. In the years after the 2000s, CMTs increasingly were sent to African countries (Table 7).15 Generally, from its inception in 1963, the Ch inese government sent a large number of CMTs to Africa. By 2009, it dispatched about 21,000 medical workers to 69 countries of the Global South. Among them, about 17,000 medical workers were in 48 African countries.16 The table below shows the trend of Chinese medical workers in different Af rican countries from 1963 to 2013. After this br oad overview of the CMT program in Africa, this chapter moves on to discuss specifi c case studies.

Fo llowing the crisis, Tanzania's Minister for Economic Affairs and Development Planning, Pa ul Bomani, made a special request for the CMTs to the Chinese government in 1966. The Chinese Ambassador to 112 Tanzania, He Ying, backed the request.17 The official signing of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for the CMT program between the two countries was, however, delayed since the Tanzanian Minister for Health, Dere k Bryceson, who was British-born and educated at Cambridge, was extremely sceptical of the qu ality of Chinese doctors. It was only after Bryceson attended a conference he ld at the University of Dar es Salaam in 1967, where visiting Chinese Professor Wu Jieping presented the development of medical services in China, that the Minister for Health changed his percepti on of what Chinese doctors could offer to Tanzania. 18 Due to the Minister's original sceptici sm, the 1966 request for medical assistance had been drafted and sent to China by the Mi nister for Economic Affairs and Development Planning rather than the Ministry of Healt h. The presentation by Wu spread widely and influenced even President Juliu s Nyerere to hold a private c onversation with Consul Zhou Boping about Chinese medical doctors to Tanzania . Nyerere referred to Wu's presentation as an eye-opener about the quality of China's health care system.19 In 1967, the Ministry of Health (MoH) sent a detailed report about Tanzania's health challenges to Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai. The report informed about the deprived medical and health condition of the country where se veral diseases such as smallpox, leprosy, tuberculosis, malaria, typhoid, bi lharzia, filariasis, and other prevalent high morbidity diseases were rampant. Indeed, medical inadequacies such as lack of medical staff, medicines, and medical equipment disadvantaged the count ry's dealing with health challenges.20 A tour to China by medical delegates of Tanzania in November 1967, amplified the request for the CMTs. The delegates met Premier Zhou and signed a general agreement on the CMT program, upon which Zhou ordered Shandong province to send medical teams to Tanzania. 21 On May 6, 1968, the Ministries of Health of the two count ries signed a contract for the CMT program (Figure 5).22 The MoU assigned the Shandong province to send CMTs to Tanzania every two years. Consequently, from 1968 to the presen t, the Shandong province has been sending 17 \"A Special Report, Chinese Medical Assistance to Tan zania, May 12, 1972,\" TNA. Acc.

While working in Tanzania , CMTs were entitled to the holidays paid for by the Chinese and Tanzanian governments. Chines e doctors were also entitled to a one-month leave after eleven months of service in Tanzania. To avoid any problems in the host country, the CMTs observed laws and orders promulgate d by the government. Moreover, according to the signed agreement, the Tanzanian government had the leeway to either shorten or request an extension of the service of any Chinese doctor.25 The Chinese government dispatched the CMTs to Tanzania at the height of Cold War politics when the UN Assembly did not recognise the Chinese government. Instead, the UN recognised the Taiwanese government as represen tative of the whole of China (Chapter 1). Furthermore, it was the period when China, a lienated from the Sovi et Union, was fighting against both so-called US \"imperialism\" and Soviet \"revisionism.\" Thus, throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the Chinese experts deployed by the government to work overseas spearheaded the fight against \"imperialism\" and \"revisionism\" while maintaining their country's influences and interests. 26 These contexts informed the recruitment, training, and activities of the CMTs sent to Tanzania. For instance, medical doctors disp atched in the 1960s and 1970s were all faithful members of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Party membersh ip was a necessary selection criterion for recruits since their government assi gned them a role to spread Maoism, boost Sino- Tanzanian friendship and maintain China's influence in the region.27 The partisanship criterion continued even after China halted political pr opaganda following its reform and opening-up policy in 1978. The Chinese government needed d iligent medical doctors who were capable of defending China's political, social, and economic interests overseas.28 The doctors from the Shandong province recruited for serv ice in the CMT possessed specific professional and physical merits such as clinical training with tertiary qualifications, good professional recommendations with at least five to ten year s working experience, healthy physique with a maximum age of 55. Under such criteria, most of the doctors sent to Tanzania were older than 30 years of age, and many were married though they were not allowed to travel 25 \"Letter from Consulate of the People's Republic of China in Zanzibar, August 17, 1978 to Honourable E.

A bove all, most of the female doctors were unwilling to join the CMT program since they atte nded more to social responsibilities at home than their male counterparts.30 The province needed to recrui t qualified doctors to meet regulations by the Registrar of the Medical Council of Tanganyi ka (MCT) who verified the merits of their professional qualifications. The council had a mandate of issuing medical doctors with professional working licences or otherwise based on council's promulgated criteria.31 In the 1960s and 70s, the Shandong province encountered difficulties in mobilising qualified medical personnel to participate in CMT program, especially in the categories of gynaecology, anaesthesia, surgery and other more skilled personnel since it did not have enough experts in those fields. Unlike the Cuba n government, which had an excess of medical personnel from the 1970s,32 many Chinese provinces suffered a shortage of skilled medical personnel due to their growing population and disease burden.33 For instance, in 1981, a single Chinese doctor attended to 1,730 patients. However, the situation was wors e in Africa since, in the same period, a single doctor in Kenya attended to 10,140 patients while in Sudan 9,800 and Ghana 7,200. 34 Despite the demands of medical docto rs at home, the prevailing Cold War politics made the dispatch of CMTs overseas politically and economical ly imperative for the Chinese government (Chapter 1). Chinese doctors deployed to Tanzania were experts with varying specialisations depending on prevailing health challenges and sp ecial requests from Tanzania's MoH. Oral anecdotes I collected support the theory that ther e were negotiations between officials from the MoH and Shandong Health Bureau about the ki nds of experts demanded by the Tanzanian 29 \"The Dispatch of Medical Aid Team to Tanzania, 1 978,\" SPA.

For example, in 1972, it receiv ed a team of more than thirty members including five surgeons, six physicians, one anaesthetist, two acupuncturists, seven gynaecologists and obstetricians, seven eye, ear, nose and throat (ENT) doctors, five interpreters, and one matron.36 Similarly, in 1976, it received more than forty members comprising nine surgeons, three physicians, two paediatricians, six gynaecologists, three anaesthetists, six ENT experts, six acupuncture specialists, eight physic ians, eight assistant physicians, three radiographers, one driver, and one interpreter. 37 However, from the 1990s onwards, the number of local medi cal personnel increased. Yet, th ey were mostly physicians who needed further training and mentorship to ad dress pressing health cases. Subsequently, the MoH requested and received specia list doctors to address more critical health cases of ENT, gynaecology, obstetrics, and surgery to easy ment orships and address cases that could not be adequately cared for by local personnel.38 Chinese doctors underwent language training before travelling ove rseas. This training was of importance because their activities involved interactions with patients and local doctors. While Tanzania's lingua franca is Kiswahili, many Tanzanians speak and understand English with varying levels of fluency. The CMTs dispat ched to Tanzania attend ed six months training in English and Kiswahili in Jinan.39 Under Mao's regime, language training stressed Kiswahili since the doctors spent half of their time in rural areas where the majority of people spoke Kiswahili and local langu ages. Moreover, under Mao, China antic ipated spreading its influence and political propaganda. Thus, th e CMTs had to interact effectively with political elites and other influential people, and the interact ion was more effective through Kiswahili.40 However, 35 Interview by Andrea Kifyasi with Simon Ernest, May 7, 2018, MoH Headquarters, Dar es Salaam.

In the 1960s and 1970s, the Chines e government dispatched a large number of doctors to Tanzania who were sited in severa l regions and districts. Such distributions demanded more translators, at least one in each region. For instance, in 1972, 34 doctors were placed to Tanzania and divided into small teams se nt to different district hospitals of Morogoro, Dodoma, Kigoma, Musoma, and Mbeya regions, where each team required its own translator.42 The language barrier was still not solved since translators were unfamilia r with some medical terms and they did not always accompany medical doctors in their work sites.43 Song Tao, who worked as an interpreter for more than eight years, admitted that he translated ordinary conversation, especially when the teams met government offi cers and rarely to patients. However, Song underscored that the language handicap was always critical in the early months, but the teams addressed the challenge gradually as they interacted wi th patients and local doctors.44 The recruitment of translators was consistent with the needs of the Chinese government. As to the CMTs, translators were faithful members of the CCP. Indeed, their functions and competences went far beyond transl ation. For instance, they worked as drivers of the CMTs and wrote reports and minutes after a meeting with government officials. Translators also taught the Engl ish language to the doctors at night and assisted medical workers when needed. More importantly, they in teracted with different groups of people and engaged in political discussions to discern people's perceptions of the Chinese presence in Tanzania in comparison to doctors from \"imperialist\" countries. In the same vein, they read local newspapers and reported to the Chines e government about their discoveries. They compiled and submitted reports detailing political and economic situations of Tanzania as well 41 \"Job Description and Work Reports of the Medical Team in Tanzania, 1981,\" SPA.

There were two rounds of vists: the first preceding the arrival of the whol e team, and the second, as a fo llow-up, taking place before the teams started working. In January and February 1968, a group of five doctors, one nurse and one interpreter led by Tsao Yuen-Chung carried out a 40-day medical tour in 16 districts and one city of Tanzania. The team went to Mt wara and spent four da ys studying the kind of medical assistance appropriate for the region a nd the suitability of the living and working environment. They visited Ligula Hospital, Mt wara dispensary and Rutamba health centre before proceeding to Nachingwea, where they visi ted the district hospital and dispensaries. The team further went to Dodoma and Singida Regions and visited regional hospitals, clinics and health centres.46 After the visits, they documented the ex isting health challenges such as the lack of medicines and medical equipment, l ack of electricity and water supply, and the challenge of transport and communication. The team did not only study Tanzania's health system and the challenges facing th e health sector but also perfor med a diplomatic and political role. For instance, they explor ed the stability and influence of countries of the North in Tanzania and studied people's pe rception of China and Mao's philo sophy. In their report, they noted that imperialist countries still had a stro ng influence in Tanzania despite the country's taking the socialist path in 1967. The team provided suggestions for curbing the hardships and improving the living and working conditions to ensure their effective performance and comfortability.47 Their reports marked a wakeup call a nd guided their preparations before travelling to Tanzania. Nevertheless, prelimin ary tours ended up in th e 1980s since activities of the CMTs were limited to four regions (see below) whos e living and working conditions were already familiar.48 45 \"Job Description and Work Reports of the Medical Team in Tanzania, 1981,\" SPA.

Preliminary preparations were vital for the accomplishment of the CMTs medical and political missions to Tanzania. Archival informati on supports that activities of the CMTs in the 1960s and 70s also involved political propagand a. For example, the Chinese doctors spread Mao's publications (red books) to political elites, coll ege students, doctors, and patients. They further criticised imperialism and neo-coloni alism in their talks to different groups of Tanzanians. They carried and dist ributed printed photogr aphs of Mao to regional, district, and 120 village leaders (Figure 6). In Dodoma Regi on, a Regional Commissioner (RC) received Mao's photo and \"kissed\" it. While in Butiama-Mara, Nyerere' s brother received the photo and hung it on the house's wall. Such deeds enhanced China's influence in the country and boosted Mao's popularity and his anti-imperialistic prop aganda. Through activit ies of the CMTs, many Tanzanians knew Mao. The Direct or of Muhimbili National Hospital first did not know Mao, but came to know him through books and photos he received from Chinese doctors as gifts.49 After the reform and opening-up policy, the CMTs engaged in discouraging the influence of pro-Maoists who were against the reform and opening-up policy. The doctors further commended the merits of the newly adopted po licy to Sino-Tanzanian relations. Additionally, they spread Deng Xiaoping's speeches and publications to enhance his influence and strengthen understandings of the reform and opening-up policy in Tanzania.50 During the height of Cold War politics, the Chinese government anticipated that capitalist countries would spy the Chinese government through Chinese working overseas. Hence, at its inception, the CMTs working in Tanzania were forb idden from interfering in the internal affairs of the recipien t country, talking to j ournalists, attending en tertainment centres, and revealing the secret of the Chinese govern ment to foreigners. Moreover, the government prohibited them from arguing with foreigners, having a private connection with them, including romantic relationships and marriages.51 Generally, throughout Mao's reign, the CMTs had limited interactions with foreigners in Tanzania. Nevertheless, after Deng Xiaoping's reform and opening-up policy, the CMTs interacted wi th foreigners strategically. The government enhanced doctors' training in English. Recruitment proces ses gave preference to doctors who mastered the English language, precisely to facili tate interactions with foreigners, which were deemed imperative in order to boost medical science and technology. Th e Chinese government, therefore, instructed the CMTs to work closel y with foreign doctors, examine their technical expertise and learn from them. 52 49 \"Job Description and Work Reports of the Medical Team in Tanzania, 1981,\" SPA.

The MoH distributed the CMTs among different regional an d district hospitals. The number of doctors sent to the hospitals varied depending on the demands and health challenges reported by recipient regions. The number of Chinese doctor s received per batch further determined its variation.54 For example, the first batch ha d 43 doctors and was divided into eight groups distributed among the districts of Mara, D odoma, and Mtwara regions.55 The second batch had 46 doctors who were divided into 14 teams sent to the districts of Kigoma, Tabora, Shinyanga, Mbeya, and Morogoro regions. The third batch was divided into 11 teams, and they worked CMTs provided medical services to different regions of Tanzania. Up to 2015, they had worked in 13 regions of Tanzania, including Dodoma, Dar es Salaam (Figure 7). 57 However, from the 1990s onwards, the services by the CMTs concentrated on only four regions of Ta nzania, namely Dar es Salaam, Dodoma, Tabora, and Mara.58 54 \"A Memo, 5/6/1973,\" TNA.

Their services re ached regions that repor ted many health cases. Furthermore, regions and distri cts where outstanding politicians and leaders had their origins were served in priority. For example, Chin ese doctors worked in Mara Region, the home province of President Nyerere. They further work ed in Monduli District, the constituency of the Prime Minister, Edward Moringe Sokoine, a nd to Mtwara the home and constituency of the Minister for Health, Shaba. It is likely that political leaders' influence prompted the distribution process. Furthermore, the Chinese government probably gave priority to such regions to win the hearts and minds of political elites in Tanzania. Historical and prominent regions of Tanzania were also of priority. Fo r instance, teams worked in Dodoma, the national capital and the headquarter of the ruling part y, Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM), a partner of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), and, in Dar es Salaam, the economic capital of the country. Medical teams from other countries worked in regions with low politic al influence such as Tanga and Coast for the case of Cuban doctors, Morogoro for the case of Italian doctors and Mbeya for the case of Soviet doctors.59 Indeed, the distri bution of the CMTs in Tanzania was done strategically to accomplish China's medi cal and political missions in the country. Generally, China's medical assistance to Tanzania has lasted for more than 50 years to the present, and the dispatch of CMTs by the Shandong province has never stopped despite the changes in China's foreign policy (discussed below). This long-term medical assistance gave confidence to the Chinese President, Xi Jinping, to mention in 2013 that China and Tanzania were \"all-weather friends\".60 Available statistics show that up to 2017, Shandong province deployed 24 batches of CMTs with an equivalent total of about 1080 medical workers.61 The structure and activities of the CMTs in Tanzania changed with time, echoing to the dynamism of China's foreign policy as ela borated at length in the next section. 59 For Soviet doctors read \"Bomani to Discuss Aid in Moscow,\" Sunday News , November 2, 1967, 1, and for Cuban doctors read \"Cuba Sends More Doctors,\" Daily News , September 12, 1977, 3, and \"Italian Doctors Arrive,\" Daily News , July 19, 1977, 1, for Italians. 60 The statement was made by Chinese president Xi Jinping in his state visit to Tanzania in 2013, read Xi, The Governance of China , 333. 61 A Speech by H. E. Wang Ke, Ambassador of China to Tanzania, November 3, 2017. 125 3.4 \"Neither Permanent Friends nor Enemies\": The Dynamics of China's Foreign Policy and its Implications to the CMT Program in Tanzania China's foreign policy was never static but changed instead, resonating with the political and economic interests of the Chines e government. For example, in the 1960s and early 1970s, the foreign policy targeted at enab ling China to win diplom atic recognition over Taiwan and get admitted into the UN General Assembly (UNGA). China vowed to maintain relationships with countries of the South for the sake of their votes to the Assembly. During this era, it extended medical assistance to c ountries of the South which supported \"One China policy\".62 Countries that recognised Taiwan as a nation were removed from Beijing's friends list and disqualified from receivi ng medical assistance from China.63 In an attempt to forge close relations and win allies, the Chinese government dispatched a large number of doctors to Africa a nd carried most of the cost burden related to hosting them. For instance, throughout the 196 0s and 1970s, Shandong province dispatched medical workers to Tanzania in two batches per single medical team which arrived in the country in the intervals of eith er months or a year. This tend ency enabled the MoH to receive medical doctors from China every year between 1968 to 1985. For instance, the batch of the first team went to Tanzania in May 1968 and was joined by the second batch in August 1968. Other medical workers of the second batch went to Tanzania in January, May, and October 1969, making a total of 86 medical workers of the first medical team to Tanzania (Table 8). Consistently, the first batch of the second medical team arrived in August 1970 and was joined by other members of the second batch in Apr il 1971, making a total of 84 medical workers of the second medical team. Surely, at the beginni ng of the CMT program, Tanzania received a more significant number of Chinese medical doc tors than other African countries, which, in turn, enhanced Sino-Tanzanian re lations. On the one hand, the disp atch of Chinese doctors to Tanzania was couched in humanitarian discourse and indeed cost the Chinese government dearly, given the country's own shortage of trained medical personnel. On the other hand, China's devotions were driven by political calculations, since Nyerere, and Salim Ahmed 62 Huang, \"Pursuing Health as Foreign Policy,\" 108. 63 See, for instance, Li, Chinese Medical Cooperation in Africa, 12. 126 Salim,64 a permanent representative of Tanzania to the UN, had significant influence regarding China's admission in the UNGA campaign.65 Before changes in China's foreign polic y, the Chinese government mainly carried costs for hosting CMTs in Tanzania . It met charges for domestic sa lary, international travelling, and language training. Moreover, the government compensated hospitals which members of the CMTs came from during their training at home and service abroad.66 The Chinese government also shipped to the port of Dar es Salaam the daily necessities for the CMT, including imported means of transportation, ai r conditioners, electrical household appliances, and food. The shipments were exempted from tax at the port of Dar es Salaam, and the Tanzanian government assisted in matters such as customs, declaration, clearance, and forwarding to meet all the necessa ry costs as import duty charges.67 Furthermore, throughout Mao's reign, the Chinese government pr ovided grants of medicines and medical equipment to Tanzania to address deficits. Under the signed MoU, the Tanzanian government was to supply the CMTs with medical equipment and drugs for their work. 68 Nevertheless, many hospitals in post-co lonial Tanzania lacked enough medical equipment and medicines supply. The governme nt depended mainly on imported drugs and medical equipment, which were less satisfactory and sometimes delayed in reaching the 64 Salim Ahmed Salim was a Tanzanian who served in se veral international diplomatic positions including Tanzania's Ambassador to the People's Republic of China, 1969-1970, and a Permanent Representative of Tanzania to the United Nations, 1970-1980. His vigorous support to the admission of China in the UNGA labelled him as a pro-China officer, and this punished him when he contested for UN Secretary-General seat in 1981. The US and its allies were not ready to see Salim, a pro-Chin a activist, hold such a prestigious international position. The Chinese government highly respects Salim, and he has been awarded a Friendship Medal, China's highest honour to foreigners recently (2019). Up to the present Sali m is the only African to be awarded such medal.

For instance, the first team of doctors went to Tanzania with a total of 1,000 boxe s containing drugs and medical equipment. Consistently, other CMTs carried along with medicines and medical equipment.69 Indeed, grants for medicines and medical equipment were imperative not only for the CMTs work but also for the general improveme nt of health care services in Tanzania. The donated facilities supplemented a few availa ble in hospitals, and hence improved the community's wellbeing. Throughout the 1960s to 1977, the Tanzanian government carried few costs for hosting the CMTs. The government met costs for th e return flights and upcountry trips. While in Tanzania, the teams travelled by train for those allocated to places linked to the railway network, such as Singida, Mbeya, and Dodoma. Th e ministry sent cars to doctors posted to regions close to Dar es Salaam. Others who work ed in remote places su ch as Mara, Shinyanga, and Kigoma travelled by flight. Moreover, the Tanzanian government provided lodging for the CMTs and covered costs related to house main tenance, water, electricity, and phone bills. Additionally, it provided security gu ards and cleaners for the residences of the CMTs as well as drivers for each of the Chin ese doctor teams and team leaders and met their necessary costs. 70 These assertions show that compared to cost s incurred by the Chinese government, Tanzania paid significantly less for hosting the CMTs in the country, which reflected the importance the Chinese government attributed to its partners in the South. Yet, China's enthusiasm for hosting CMTs in Tanzania ended in 1978 after the Chinese government opened up its doors to the world. A statement by the State Planning Commission avowed: \"We [Chinese] must e xpand our economic technical and cultural exchange with other countries on the principle of equality, mutual benefit and one supplying what the other needs.\" 71 The statement added: 69 \"Madaktari Interview by Andrea Kifyasi with Che Yansong, March 1, 2016, Jinan. 70 \"A Memo, 6/6/1973,\" TNA.

Repercussi ons of the policy change were especially visible in countries of the Global South. China's assistance to the South declined as it shifted its interest to countries with advanced t echnology, mostly from the North. The post-Mao leaders stressed economic gains for the Chin ese government over ideological and political interests. Consequently, they discouraged aid with less or no economic interests. In 1982, Hu Yaobang, a Communist Party chairman, emphasised that the \"pro vision of free aid was in the interest of neither side\".75 These changes in foreign policy affected the dispatch of medical doctors to Tanzania, as the Chinese government began to send medi cal doctors in a single batch only every two years. Furthermore, medical workers dispatch ed to Tanzania dropped from over 40 per batch in the 1960s and early 1970s, to below 20 from 1979 onwards. Even worse, from 1987 to 1993, the Tanzanian government received a team with le ss than 40 medi cal workers. The number of medical doctors further declined from 1995 to 2011, when the government received a team with less than 30 medical workers (Table 8). Unde niably, the decrease in the number of medical doctors sent to Tanzania affected the delivery of health care, especially in complex health cases and rural areas where Chinese docto rs spent half of their time.76 Chinese doctors working in Tanzania suppor ted the newly adopted reform policy. In their annual report of 1978, they advised the go vernment to reduce costs spent on the CMT program by cutting down the number of medical wo rkers sent to Tanzania.

Gallus is a retired Principal Assistant Secr etary, Ministry of Health. 129 Changan, affirmed that the Shandong province lacked enough medical personnel and it faced several health challenges. Thus, it was advantag eous for the province to encourage doctors to work at home.77 Their advice manifested the fact that the execution of the program did not satisfy some medical workers. In their view, sending medical doctors abroad was worthless and hurt the delivery of hea lth care in their province. Th e annual report of 1986 further underscored the reform of the CMT program. Howe ver, the report went further by discouraging the distributions of the CMTs to several district s of Tanzania. They argue d that the distributions increased maintenance costs and hindered effec tive delivery of health services since some medicines and medical equipment, foodstuffs, c ooks, translators, and medical experts had to serve many different locations. In their view, the mentioned faciliti es would have been satisfactorily used if they had been concentrated into a few hospitals.78 As a result, at the end of 1980, the activities of the CMTs were concentrated into four regional referral hospitals, and they did not work in rural dispensaries. Nevertheless, despite the policy change, Shandong province has never stopped dispatching medical wo rkers to Tanzania from its inception to the present. The changes of the foreign policy imp licated their number, ac tivities, and costs of hosting them in Tanzania. The changes in China's foreign policy in creased the burden of hosting CMTs to recipient countries. From 1978, the Tanzanian gove rnment paid more to bring and host the CMTs. Under the 1978 MoU signed between the tw o countries, the government had to cover some expenses previously carried by the Ch inese government. For instance, it began paying monthly allowances, including board expenses and pocket money for the CMTs amounting to Tshs. 900 per month per head. Unde r the MoU, the government had to adjust the allowances if the commodity price fluctuation would exc eed 10%. As a result, on October 25, 1979, the CMTs demanded the increase of allowances fr om Tshs. 900 of 1978 to Tshs. 1,400 per head per month due to the soaring inflation. In the 198 0s, when Tanzania's economy was in turmoil, its currency lost value. Thus, allowances shot from Tshs. 1400 of 1979 to Tshs. 2,250 per head per month as from October 1, 1981. 79 Information about the livi ng allowances for the 1990s 77 \"Work Reports of the Medical Aid Team in Tanzania, 1978,\" SPA.

However, data from the mid- to late-2000's shows that the constant decline of the local currency influenced the execution of payments in the USD. Article VII of the 2007 MoU instructed the Tanzania n government to pay living a llowances of about USD 170 equivalent to Tshs. per head per month. Subse quently, in February 2009, the MoH issued Tshs. 16,834,734, three months allowance to 25 Chinese doctors.80 The initiation of allowances to the CMTs and its tremendous increase over tim e added cost burden to Tanzania's economy, while reflecting the priorities of the post-Mao regime, which discouraged free aid to overseas countries. Furthermore, from the 1980s, the Tanzanian government had to arrange and meet costs for the CMTs' tours of se veral parts of the c ountry, including the National Parks for the doctors to have a holiday. Thus, before the expi ration of the contract, or after CMT had worked in the country for about twelve months, the government set a fifteen-day holiday and seven- day trip to Kilimanjaro, Ngorongoro, and Serengeti or any other places of interest proposed by the CMTs.81 The cost burden for regional and dist rict governments was considerable. For example, in 1981, Chinese doctors visited Mi kumi National Park, Ba gamoyo, and Serengeti National Park, where regions/districts hosting th em covered all costs related to the tour amounting to Tshs. 144,510 in total.82 Costs for the tour rose with time. For example, in 1996, the Dodoma Regional government alone spent Ts hs. 2.5 million for the tour by Chinese doctors working at the referral hospital. The regional government complained over the costs arguing that they were higher and a burden to the government given the economic plight of the country. 83 and Industry, File No. DO5/25, 1976 March to May 1983, Mahusiano na Nchi za Nje-China; \"Letter from the Principal Secretary to the Treasury of the URT, February 25, 1982 to Mr Chung Chien Hua, Economic Representative of the PRC to the URT,\" ZNA.

Instead, it agreed to continue providing grants of medicines and medical equipment while charging fees to patients in which about 70% of the fees collected belonged to the CMTs, and 30% we nt to respective hospita ls. According to the MoU, the charges aimed to maintain the sustai nability and effectiveness of the CMT program since the money collected was sent to China' s MoH for the purchase of drugs and medical equipment for use by the next batch of the CM Ts. Chinese doctors presented to the hospital management the costs and quantity of the donated medicines for further reference.84 Thus, there were two pharmacies in the hospitals where the CMTs worked, one for the Chinese-made medicines served by a CMT member and the ot her for general medicines served by local pharmacists. Oral and archival evidence shows th at Chinese-made medicines were sold cheaper than medicines sold at local pharmacies.85 This strategy promoted the use, popularity, and market of Chinese-made drugs in Tanzania in line with the priorities formulated by China's senior officer from the MoH: \"China's health aid should not only serve China's foreign policy but also act as a broker for economic deve lopment in China and recipient countries.\"86 Surely, from 1978, the Chinese government manipulated th e CMT program to promote the market for Chinese medicines in Tanzania. These manipul ations increased espe cially in the 1990s, following official approval of Chinese anti-malaria medicine (artemisinin), where the CMTs promoted its efficacy and prescribed the therapy to patients with malaria.87 From the mid-1990s, China's in terests in Africa resumed, fuelled by the government's thirst for natural resources and political hegemony, as scholars have maintained. Yanzhong Huang states that in the 2000s, China's medical assistance to Africa heig htened and bolstered China's friendship with many Afri can states, which, in turn, help ed the Chinese government to tap into natural resources, dilute criticism fr om countries of the North over its violation of 84 \"The Agreement Protocol of 2007-2009,\" NRC.

It further re-dispatched a large number of medical doctors to several African countries.89 In Tanzania, for instance, from August 2009, the Chinese government covered co sts related to monthl y allowances and return tickets for the CMTs. The Chinese government also took steps to permanently waive costs related to logging. It has recently built a house in Dar es Salaam to be used by members of the CMT and other technical teams sent to Tanzania. The house was meant to improve the living conditions of the Chinese medical doctors and relinquish cost s the Tanzanian government incurs for rent.90 These assertions imply that from the mid-1990s , China lessened the cost burden of some African countries while using CMT program to bol ster its relationship w ith African countries and portray itself as a more res ponsible and reliable partner than traditional donors of the North. 3.5 The CMT Program and the South-South Knowledge Exchange Agenda China's medical assistance to Tanzania included exchanges of medical knowledge with local medical workers, a role which was initially performed mainly by countries of the North. In the name of Southern solidarity, South-South knowledge pr oduction and transmission were cast as a key to self-dependency.91 Consequently, the Chinese government implemented the Southern agenda by dispatching medical doctors while promising to foster knowledge exchange. In line with Mao's philosophy, the Chinese doctors pe rceived recipients to have prior knowledge which was worth sharing wh ile working together. Mao underscored to Chinese experts working overseas that: A country, whether big or small, has its knowledge. All of us should have the habit of being students to learn from our colleagues in every matter, whether language or traditions, 88 Huang, \"Pursuing Health as Foreign Policy,\" 128. 89 For Chinese government commitment to medical assistance in the 2000s re ad Part IV of \"China's African Policy, January 2006 ,\" Xinhua News Agency , October 2006, 6-7. 90 \"Talking Notes for the Permanent Secretary on the O ccasion of Farewell and Welcome Ceremony to the Chinese Medical Team in Tanzania, August 14, 2009 at New Holiday Inn,\" NRC.

Oral testimonies support that despit e pitfalls (discussed be low) Chinese doctors worked cooperatively with local medical doctors.93 Training local medical workers was am ong the goals to which the Chinese government pledged itself from the commenc ement of the CMT program. In 1965, Premier Zhou visited Zanzibar and underscored the role of Chinese doctors in building the capacity of the recipient country's h ealth sector. He said: Now we have several dozens of CMTs abroad, yet it is not enough. CMTs should not only cure the disease, but help training work. Th ey should bring medicine and facilities, train African doctors, who can be self-reliant and wo uld work even if CMTs went away.... We would provide sincere help to any independent country. Our assistance is to make the country able to stand up. Just like building a bridge, so you can cross the river without a staff. That would be good.94 Zhou's commitment was highlighted by Mao when he met Nyerere in 1974. Mao reaffirmed that the role of CMTs in Tanzania would be \"teaching\" local medical doctors and \"clinical care\" to patients.95 The exchange of medical knowledge was executed through long-term and short-term training in numerous Chinese medical colleges and through the CMT program, where local medical workers learned while working together with Chinese doctors (discussed below). The aforementioned ways of training were comparable to the system applied by the Cuban government, which also trained local medical workers of reci pient countries on site while others received government scholarships for further training in Cuban medical schools. 96 The Chinese government offered several scholarships to Tanzanians to pur sue medical education 92 \"Report of the Chinese medical doctors to the Minister for Health, January 27, 1967,\" ZNA.

Scholarships were for both long-term studies and short-term training courses executed in different Chinese medical colleges. For instance, in November 19 73, about five Tanzanians, all females, were sponsored by the Chinese government to pursue a medical education in Chinese universities.97 The Chinese government offered more scholarsh ips in 1976, when five local medical workers attended a three-months ' training in replantation and acupunc ture, and one person went on for a long-time medical education. A few Tan zanians received provincial government scholarships, whereby, in 1984, the surgical department of the Shandong Medical Academy admitted two Tanzanians.98 Long- and short-time training exposed Tan zanians to Chinese medical knowledge and health care systems. This exposure served to ma intain trust in the effectiveness of Chinese health care, which, in tu rn, bolstered the country's influen ce in Tanzania. In 1977, a delegate of medical workers led by the Pr incipal Secretary of the MoH, G. J. Kileo, attended a short- term training in China, upon returning to Tanzan ia, Kileo wrote an appr eciation letter saying: All of us were very excited to see your Re volution in practice.

Cold War politics hijacked the expedien cy and sustainability of the Chinese government sponsorships to Tanzania's medi cal students. In the 1970s and 1980s, medical students who pursued medical studies in socialis t countries such as China, Rumania, Russia, and Cuba were highly discriminated against th e \"Makerere Group\", composed of Tanzanians who pursued medical studies at Ma kerere in Uganda as well as medical schools in Europe and the US. Graduates from socialist countries, espe cially China, were perceived as less skilful, and the Medical Council of Tanganyika (MCT ) did not recognise their certificates.100 The council regarded MD ce rtificates offered by Chinese medical colleges as advanced diplomas, and it recognised the graduates only as assistant medical officers (AMOs). The issue became serious in the mid-1980s, where the Tanzania n government denied employment to medical graduates from China. 101 The Makerere Group queried the rele vance of the duration of studies in China, where MD students studied for less th an seven years. It should be remembered that following China's attempt to boost the capacity of the health sector, it had reduced the universally accepted training period for the MD program from seven to five years. Moreover, after the Cultural Revolution of 1966 to 76, it further redu ced the training peri od to three years. Such attempts enabled China to have about 2,800,000 qualified but the sh ort-trained doctors, and a comparatively favourable rati o of one doctor per 250 people by 1977. 102 The duration of between five- and three- year training for the MD program was inconsistent with the globally accepted trai ning system. However, chairman Mao advocated the system politically directing that: 100 The Medical Council of Tanganyika was established in 1959 to oversee medical and dental practice in Tanzania.

How many years did Hua T'o [Hua Tuo]103 spend at college? How many years [of] education did Li Shih-chen [Li Shizhen]104 of the Ming dynasty receive? In medical education there is no need to accept only higher middle school graduate s or lower middle school graduates. It will be enough to give three years to graduates from higher primary schools. They would then study and raise their standards mainly through pr actice. If this kind of doctor is sent down to the countryside, even if they haven't much talent, they would be better than quacks and witchdoctors and the villages would be better able to afford to keep them. The more books one reads the more stupid one gets.105 Mao himself stressed idealism and the \"right \" political allegiance - \"a red heart\" - over academic training. To him, what mattered most was not the number of years trainees accumulate but the passion and eagerness of the trai ned personnel. This context explains why, after liberation, medical schools in China promot ed Maoism and indocrinated medical trainees with socialist ideology. Besides professional training, medical students attended a socialist political education.106 The Chinese government established a one-y ear upgrade course in Chinese medical colleges to enable the recognition of the graduates by the MCT. Accordingly, the MCT recognised medical graduates admitted to the upgrade course. By contrast, the MoH demoted graduates who did not join the upgrade cour se to the rank of AM Os and others were recategorized to administrative posts. 107 This incident discourag ed prospective medical students from accepting Chinese government scholarships since they perceived China as an undesirable place for medical education compar ed to European and American medical colleges. General statistics of medical doctors from Tanzania who pursu ed medical courses in China are missing. However, oral accounts s how that the number declined over time throughout the Cold War period. 108 103 Hua Tuo was a Chinese physician who lived during the late Eastern Han dynasty.

A study by Paul Kadetz and Johanna Hood shows that CM Ts working in Madagascar primarily provided clinical care to patients, a nd they hardly spent time training local medical workers. In this regard, they generally concluded that the CMT program failed to build capacity and improve the local health sector sustainably. 109 Unlike Madagascar's case, findings from Tanzania show that Chinese doctors did sh are knowledge with local medical workers. However, the role of knowledge sharing and ment orship was less stressed than clinical care. The MoU signed between the two countries put trai ning as optional. For example, Article II of the MoU stated the duties of the CMTs that they had: [. . .] to assist the Tanzanian side, through close cooperation with the Tanzanian medical personnel, to carry on medical work (exclusive of medical legal cases), and to exchange experience and learn from each other in the course of medical practice. If necessary, the Chinese doctors may, in their respective departments, train the Tanzanian doctors so as to enhance their ability in medical services.110 Assertions from the above quotation imply that local medical workers had to learn from the Chinese doctors in the course of medi cal practice. The agreement used the term \"may\" inferring that Chinese doctors were not obligated to train local doctors. Nevertheless, archival evidence collected from Zanzibar shows that the doctors did train local medical workers, allocating at least one hour per week to train them in basic physical diagnosis and practical pharmacology. 111 In mainland Tanzania, Chinese doctors di d not allocate a particular time for formal training but disseminated knowledge in the course of medical practice.112 From the existing pieces of evid ence, it is clear that on-site training did no t equip local medical workers with sufficient medical knowledg e for them to work independently, especially with regard to complicated health cases. This shortcoming defeated the goal of using the CMT 109 Paul Kadetz and Johanna Hood, \"Outsourcing China's Welfare: Unpacking the Outcomes of Sustainable Self- Development in Sino-African Health Diplomacy,\" in Handbook of Welfare in China (Handbooks of Research on Contemporary China Series , ed.

Acc ounts from local medical workers contend that many Chinese doctors could neither speak English nor Kiswahili fluently.113 Such linguistic handicap limited medical knowledg e exchanges and implied that the six months of language training the CMTs received were insufficient. In the 1978 annual report, the CMTs affirmed that the language barrier was the main hind rance to passing medical knowledge on to local medical personnel. However, this study noted th at practical medical works such as surgery gave local doctors more opportunities to learn by seeing and practising u nder the guidance of Chinese doctors (Figure 8).114 Reciprocal learning between Chinese and local medical workers seemed to have been even more problematic. This research has f ound that in most cases, Chinese experts were disseminating medical knowledge to local perso nnel. Nevertheless, they somewhat learned medical practices from local e xperts through interactions and obs ervations in the course of medical practices, hence gained experience in addressing several unaccustomed diseases.115 Moreover, Chinese doctors conducted medical re search while working in Tanzania, which further enhanced their expertis e. For instance, in 1978, the CMTs working in the Kigoma and Dar es Salaam regions conducted medical res earch on tropical diseases which were less prevalent in China, and they composed intensive reports about their discoveries.116 A few cases reflect the legacy of Chines e medical doctors in places where they worked. For instance, in Dodoma Regional Referr al Hospital, Rajabu Kisonga testifies that he successfully learned from Chinese doctors and ma naged to take over the eye department after the doctors left. Kisonga, who was a mere physicia n (not eye specialist), worked closely with Chinese doctors and after tw o years he could address many eye cases except surgery.117 Other evidence collected from Zanzibar reveals that tr ainees from the surgical department addressed several surgical cases by themselv es after they worked for a year with Chinese doctors.

However, within the modality of training, the framework of the signed agreements and language barriers were the main hindrance to on-site medical knowledge exchange.

However, the CMTs faced numerous challenges related to transport as well as living and working environments, mostly during the 1960s through to the 1980s. In the 1960s, the challenge of transport, especially to th e rural areas, was critical. Roads were hardly passable, especially during the rainy season. Publ ic buses were limited to towns and cities, and only a few went to the count ryside. Although by the 1960s a nd 1970s, China's economic and social infrastructures were less advanced, they already had better roads, electricity and water supplies, as well as friendly public transpor t in many places. Consequently, the overall economic and social situation in Tanzania was somewhat a shock to the CMTs, and they took time to get used to the new lifestyle (see below). 119 The MoH gave CMTs vehicles, but they did not supply enough for all, and some were ol d, which, in turn, led to frequent breakdowns. Ineffective transportation services forced the Chinese doctors to travel on foot through forests and mountains along with portable medi cal equipment and drugs to reach Ujamaa villages. Chinese doctors did not hire porters to carry medical boxes and other equipment (Figure 9). However, in some places, village lead ers recruited youths to escort the doctors and carry their items.120 Indeed, their response to the transportation difficulties differed distinctively from colonial transport syst ems when African porte rs carried goods and equipment for colonial authorities. Consequent ly, inconveniences in real transport systems complicated the transportation of food, medicine s, and medical equipment that in the end, affected effective clinical care.121 The health department of the Shandong province recorded other hurdles encountered by the CMTs in rural areas in which the doctors complained saying: In December of 1971, ENT [Eye, Nose and Throat] physician Lu Xiuying and I went to [. . .] [one of Ujamaa village] for the medical tour. [. . .] [the village was] 300 kilometres away from the medical station. We stayed there for three days, attended more than 200 people, did minor surgery for ten times and delivered a ch ild. The operational work is very stressful. What is more, we have to boil water and cook for ourselves. The night is especially tough. Our accommodation is a broken house in church. There is a hole in the roof. At night I can even see the moon and the stars through the hole. The house is very dirty because nobody has lived in it for a long time. After a busy da y, we are very tired and want to have a good sleep at night.

As many of my informants emphasised, liv ing and working conditions in rural areas were frustrating. However, archival evidence shows that, in some places, the MoH and village leaders attempted to better accommodate the Chinese doctors. The MoH provided safari beds to doctors working in rural areas. For example, in April 1971, the regional medical officer of Mtwara received four safari beds from the Mo H and gave them to Chinese doctors working in several Ujamaa villages. 123 Inadequate supply of medicines, medical eq uipment, water, and electricity further hampered the activities of CMTs in Tanzania. The medical s upplies that CMTs brought along did not meet the demands. Furthermore, the us e of some medical equipment was hampered because of the lack of electricity supply in so me hospitals. Besides, many health centres lacked 122 Translated from Chinese text by Guo Suhang under my request, in Health Department of the Shandong Province, The Chinese Medical-Aid Team, 11. 123 \"A Memo, 14/4/1971,\" TNA.

Thus, it ended up t ouching a few areas by providing generators and other social amenities like water and improvement of weather roads. 127 Chinese medical doctors further encountered unaccustomed diseases which challenged their medical expertise. There we re diseases which th e doctors knew of theoretically but had never c onfronted throughout their profe ssional life in China. Trachoma was of those largely unknown dis eases. Rajabu Kisonga, who also works at eye department in Dodoma, tells that when the first-time patient s with trachoma consulted the eye department, Chinese doctors were worried to attend to them before going back to reference books to revise their medical knowledge. Kisonga adds th at trachoma was mostly caused by unhygienic conditions triggered by lack of water, absence of latrines, f lies, and proximity to cattle, which, according to Chinese doctors, were unknown problems in many parts of China.128 Ding Zhaowei and Jin Xunbo contended that unaccustome d diseases were both a challenge and an opportunity for Chinese doctors to apply their medical expertise and gain new experiences.129 The hot climatic conditions in some regions where Chinese doctors worked, particularly in Dar es Salaam and Zanzibar , further complicated their working and living environment.

After the rain, hot sunlight shines in the jungle, on the fields, steaming, hot and humid. Even at night, the rooms are always up to thirty-three or thirty-four degrees, with the smell of the rainy season. Big mosquitoes bite during the day. At night, more mosquitoes can even paste the bulb.130 However, Deng Shucai and Sui Guangxin, who al so worked in Tanzania, tells that the climate was only a challenge in the early da ys since they got used to it with time.131 Furthermore, Chinese doctors encountered a threat over dangerous communicable and non-communicable diseases that were not common in China such as malaria, typhoid, cholera, and HIV/AIDS. Doctor Chen, who also worked in Tanzania, said: \"When I came to Tanzania for the first time, I was scared of deadly infec tious diseases such as malaria, yellow fever and AIDS.\" 132 Archival evidence shows th at the Chinese government inoculated the CMTs to enhance their immunity to diseases such as cholera, tuberculosis, and smallpox.133 However, many still contracted diseases. For instance, in 1986, six out of eight Chinese doctors working in Tabora contracted malaria.134 The Chinese Embassy in Tanzania repatriated medical workers with complicated health probl ems. In 1986, a cook, Yu Shanjie and doctor Su Zhongyuan left the country after facing serious health problems. On the one hand, such challe nges threatened Chinese doctors but, on the other hand, increa sed their attention and that of the hosting government.135 Still, from the inception of the CMT pr ogram to the present, only one Chinese doctor died while working in Tanzania. 130 Translated from Chinese text by Guo Suhang under my request in Health Department of the Shandong Province, The Chinese Medical-Aid Team, 12. 131 Interview by Andrea Kifyasi with Deng Shucai, May 23, 2019, Jinan; Sui Guangxin, March 1, 2016, Jinan. 132 Quoted in Ding, \"Chinese Medical Teams Bring Hope,\" 16. 133 Interview by Andrea Kifyasi with Zhang Jing, April 11, 2016, Hangzhou.

Additionally, Chinese medical doctors working in Tanzania encountered challenges related to foodstuffs and their preparations, as th ey were often forced to compromise and make do with the available local foodstuffs to cope w ith the situation. The Chinese government first attempted to address this hurdl e by dispatching a cook with every medical team. However, they did not adequately address the challenge because , in Tanzania, Chinese doctors divided into small groups comprising five to ei ght doctors or more and worked in different district hospitals. A cook had to accompany a single group. Therefor e, other doctors had to cook by themselves, which, in turn, consumed part of their working hours.136 Similarly, some food items desired by Chinese were either missing or unavailable in adequate supplies. Historica lly, Chinese food is based on two components; fan which comprised grains and other starches and cai which included vegetables and meat. These two divisi ons made a complete Chinese cuisine. Some essential foodstuffs such as noodles, soybean prod ucts, some kinds of vegetables, herbs related 136 \"Job Description and Work Reports of the Medical Team in Tanzania, 1981,\" SPA.

To address this, the Chinese government imported some foodstuffs, and the Tanzanian government waived their taxes at the Dar es Salaam port. 137 In some places of Tanzania, the CMTs planted several kinds of vegetables (Fig ure 10) and kept chickens and ducks to produce their desired foodstuffs which were either missi ng or not adequately available in the local market.138 3.7 Perceptions of the Medical Serv ices Offered by Chinese Doctors in Tanzania Prior to 1968, Chinese doctors had neither worked in Tanzania nor had any experience with the country's health challenges. Unlike medical doctors from Britain, the expertise of Chinese doctors was little known by both political elites and Tanzanian community at large. This scenario and the prevailing Cold War politics prompted a negative perception of Chinese doctors. 139 Chinese doctors themselves realised that patients, medical doctors of the North, and political elites had little faith in their expertise. To win th eir approval and eliminate doubts, Chinese doctors worked harder and with great enthusiasm. A leader of the first CMT dispatched to Algeria in 1963 told his team me mbers: \"Kindness and willingness to help alone cannot establish us here [in Alge ria]. We must be useful and offer concrete help as well.\" 140 However, sources strongly suggest that ha rd work and competence convinced many Tanzanians that the CMTs were their best opti on. For instance, in Mbeya region, patients from different nearby district s travelled to Mbeya Regional Hospital to get treatment from CMTs.141 Kadetz and Hood similarly observed that patient s in Madagascar travelled more than 45 kilometres to get treated at a hospital with CMTs.142 137 \"Protocol Between the Government of the United Republic of Tanzania and the Government of the People's Republic of China on Dispatching Medi cal Team from China to Serve in Tanz ania from August 2007 to August 2009,\" NRC.

Throughout the 1960s to 80s, hospitals and places with CMTs thrived (Figure 11), and some patients attempted to bypass the queue in several ways, includi ng writing letters to seek special permits from the MoH. For instance, Mzee Mohamedi Swala tried unsuccessfully to get attended by Chinese doctors at Muhimbili Hospital. Fortunately, he got a chance through the letter he had written to the MoH. The Ministry gave him an introductory letter, which helped him get attended swiftly. Part of the intro ductory letter read: \"[. . .] [Mohamedi Swala] has been ill with left hemipare sis since 1968. He also gives [a ] history of High Blood Pressure. He has been treated by a number of doctors with very little if any improvement. He has heard that Chinese doctors can help him. He has, therefore, asked us for assistance to see Chinese doctors.\" 143 This incident shows how difficult it c ould be for patients to obtain hospital treatment as well as their tenacity to benefit from the CMTs.

They wrote in their 1975 annual report that some patients thought medicines offered by Chinese doctors were more efficacious than alternatives provided by local and foreign doctors of the North while noting that their ther apeutic values were the same.147 However, from the 1990s onwards, fewer patients arrived at hospitals wh ere CMTs worked, partly because the number of local medical personnel increased, whom many patients preferred over Chinese doctors.148 Moreover, during this period, the Tanzanian government commenced the cost-sharing policy which made patients pay to ge t attended by either Chinese doct ors or local medical workers. Additionally, Chinese doctors charged fees to patients.149 Thus, the CMTs attended only patients who afforded hospital fees. 144 Socialist countries played a significant role in building Za nzibar's health sector's ca pacity after its successfully Revolution in 1964, after which medical workers, who were mostly Arabs, left the country. Subsequently, numerous changes existed in Zanzibar's health sector. As a result, its main hospital was officially called the \"V. I.

Nevertheless, in the 1990s, following the collapse of the socialist bloc, capitalist countries argued for changing the hospital's name to qualify for medical assistance.

The nuances were influenced by communication barriers, which created two groups of patie nts with a contrasting level of satisfaction over the received clinical services. A group of mi ddle-class patients, who also spoke English, were well informed about the CMTs and were attended by the Chin ese doctors whose Engl ish was at a good level of proficiency. Many patients from this group were satisfied with the c linical serv ices they received from the doctors. The second group comp rised ordinary patients who did not speak English and whose Kiswahili was not fluent but mixed with local dialects. The latter category preferred the services from local doctors who spoke Kiswahili and some local languages with them. They reported less favourably on the servic es they received excep t those which involved surgery. Patients belonging to this non-surgi cal group often consulte d local doctors asking them to confirm whether the prescriptions were consistent with their ailment cases.150 Mistrust arose from the fact that these patients were less confident of their abilities to express themselves before the Chinese doctors and that they could not be sure whether the doctors' prescriptions correlated with their expressed health cases. Testimonies over the abilities of Chinese doctors in delivering clinical care differed according to the places in which they worked. For instance, in 1968, G. M. Chiliko, a Member of Parliament of Mwibara consti tuency of Northwestern Tanzania, testified in parliament that Chinese doctors proved themselves efficient and cap able. He further stated that their services increased the number of people attending hosp itals for health care and decreased public complains in Mwibara constituency. 151 Such positive recommendations, especially from political elites, were rather influenced by the ge neral contexts of the health sector in the 1960s and the activities of the CMTs in Ujamaa villages. However, such praises persisted even after the 1960s, especially regarding Chinese doctor's ab ility to address critical health cases. For instance, at Kitete hospital-Tabora, patients appl auded abilities of the CMTs in surgeries of ears, nose, throat, and eyes. In April 1998, Chinese surgeons did about 100 eye surgeries successfully, after which 20 patients were doing fine, while ten regained their sight and 70 150 The nuanced perceptions between the middle class and ordinary patients were mostly relevant from the 1980s onwards when the language training to the Chinese doct ors stressed on the English language than Kiswahili. Dr Kisonga and Dr Myonga contended that many ordinary patients consulted them to verify their prescriptions after meeting Chinese doctors. In contrast, middle-class patients seemed to be satisfied with the services, and they did not ask them for further clarifications. Interview by An drea Kifyasi with Rajabu Kisonga and John G.

The activities of the Chinese doctors were also commended by officials of Tanzania's ruling party, Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM), which is also a partner of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). On different occasions, CCM offici als met the CMTs and praised their clinical care to patients. Bidding farewe ll to a CMT and welcoming a nother team in 1991, the Party Vice-Chairman, Rashidi Kawawa, paid tribute to the CMTs and the Chinese government saying: \"Your services are appreciated by Tanz anians because you are kind and caring, things that have moved a lot of people.\"153 Meetings of CMTs with the ruling party leaders bolstered relationships between CCM and CCP political parties. Findings of this study show that Chinese doctors competed vigorously to meet and atte nd government and party officials, who were attended by people with higher expertise to earn positive appreciation (Figure 12). For instance, the CMTs working in Mara region took care of Nyerere's family. In August 1975, they \"Kawawa Hails Chinese Doctors,\" Daily News , August 30, 1991, 5. 150 at Nyerere's residence in Butiama to attend Nyerere's mother, who was sick.154 Such enthusiasm to provide care to political elites was not limited to Tanzania alone. Mu Tao and Yu Bin show that the CMTs working in Uganda offered special clinical care to President Yoweri K. Museveni and his government officers. 155 Such prioritisations allowed for easier acceptance and earned them the hearts and minds of political elites. Diplomatically, positive annotations from the party and government officials were of importance. Larry Hanauer and Lyle J. Morris maintain that some African polit ical elites praised China' s assistance to ensure continued support from the Chinese government.156 Furthermore, members of parliament (MPs ) in Tanzania appreciated activities of Chinese doctors, and some requested the MoH to send them to their resp ective constituencies. For instance, in the parliamentary session of April 1971, the MP of Tarime, Omolo, requested that the MoH allow CMTs to stay longer at Tarime District Hospital and rural dispensaries. A favourable reputation of the doctors supported this request. In his words: \"Health care services offered by our brothers, Chinese doctors who volunteered to help us in hospitals and dispensaries in Mara Region ar e outstanding. Can the Ministry re quest them to live and work in villages for two consecutive year s instead of just two weeks?\" 157 Machunga, the MP of Nanyumbu constituent, also requested the di spatch of the CMTs to Masasi District.158 However, Chinese doctors dispatched to Tanzan ia would not fill the demands of the MPs. Generally, the requests did not only require th e acceptance of the CMTs services by the MPs but also reflected demands for medical personn el in several constituencies of Tanzania. Nevertheless, perceptions of CMTs were ra ther negative among some medical doctors from other countries working in Tanzania. Info rmation from the health department of the Shandong province shows that the CMTs compla ined about the fierce competition between Chinese doctors and doctors from other coun tries. Huang Xichang, the leader of the 14th batch of the CMTs to Tanzania, said: \"In Tanzania, th ere are doctors from more than ten countries, 154 \"Medical Aid to Tanzania, Work Reports, Job Descriptions and Distribution Table, 1975,\" SPA, File No. A034-04-085, Shandong Province Health Bureau. 155 Mu Tao and Yu Bin, President Y.

In their re port to the provincial health department, the CMTs mention that doctors from countries of th e North praised the health services that the former provided to patients but not the skills they possessed. Still, a few Northern doctors volunteered to collaborate with Chinese doc tors in addressing severe health cases. 161 Respondents' general overview suggests that the health care se rvices provided by the CMTs in Tanzania from the 1960s to 1980s met with overall positive responses. Some Tanzanians who experienced the services from this period gave credit to their expertise.162 However, responses from Tanzanians who expe rienced abilities and services by the CMTs from the end of the 1990s to 2000s gave a differe nt response. They claimed that they did not see any extraordinary expertise from the CMTs, underscoring that their abilities were modest and similar to the expertise possesse d by many Tanzanian medical workers - even though, they ranked higher the expertis e possessed by Cuban and medi cal doctors of the North.163 I argue that Tanzania's health care situation largely influenced these contra sting perceptions. At independence, the country had only twelve Afri can registered doctors. With the government initiatives, the number rose to 123 in 1971, 356 in 1976, and 782 in 1983 (Chapter 1).164 Therefore, Chinese doctors came to Tanzania at the moment when the country had a severe shortage of medical personnel. Furthermore, the CMTs dispatch ed to Tanzania were more qualified than local doctors, which also expl ains the positive percep tions of the CMTs by 159 Translated from Chinese by Guo Suhang under my request, Health Department of the Shandong Province, The Chinese Medical-Aid Team, 32. 160 Interview by Andrea Kifyasi with Rajabu Kisonga, April 24, 2018, Dodoma Regional Referral Cleopa David Msuya, July 6, 2018, Upanga-Dar es Salaam; Joseph W.

The increased number of trained local medical personnel might have influenced the 1990s and 2000s informants' perceptions that offered a less enthusiastic eval uation of the CMTs. 3.8 \"Winning Hearts and Minds\": The Distinctiveness of the Services by the CMTs in Tanzania Before the onset of the CMT program in Tanzania, there were medical teams from Northern and Southern countries working in the country. In order to distinguish the CMTs from previous approaches, avoid mi stakes, and thus wi n popularity, prospectiv e CMT members went on study tours prior to their dispatch. This co nfirmed a broader pattern since, as Deborah Brautigam has shown, the Chinese government ha d been keen to study traditional donors and, on this basis, design aid in a way to bolste r its own interventions, acceptance and popularity.165 In their report of March 1, 1968, they confir med that donors of the North dominated the provision of clinical ca re, medicines, medical equipment, and scholarships to medical students in Tanzania. Accordingly, they advised their go vernment to find its own distinct approach towards medical assistance.166 Indeed, before Tanzania's diplomatic clashes with West Germany and Great Britain in the mid-1960s, th e government had hired many medical doctors from Britain, Israel, Yugoslavia, Canada, and the USA (Chapter 1).167 Nevertheless, the government also received medical workers from different communist countries. For example, in 1964, the Soviet government signed an agreem ent for the deployment of medical doctors, building hospitals, credit facilities and technica l assistance to Tanzania's health sector.168 Likewise, in 1974, the Cuban government signed a technical agreement with the Tanzanian government, whereby it pledged to deploy 53 me dical doctors each year to the country. Subsequently, in 1977, it dispatched 25 medical doc tors, nineteen of whom worked in Tanga Region, and the rest remained in Dar es Salaam hospitals. 169 Furthermore, the government 165 Deborah Brautigam, The Dragon's Gift: The Real Story of China in Africa (New York: Oxford University Press, 2009), 11. 166 \"Medical Aid to Tanzania, 1968,\" SPA.

In 1977, for instance, twenty Italian doctors were sent to work in diffe rent Tanzanian district hospitals.170 These medical teams had triggered mixed res ponses. Nyerere, while talking to Consul Zhou Boping in 1967, complained that medical docto rs from countries of the North were so demanding and preferred a lavish life in a low-in come country. He grumbled that doctors from the North demanded pleasant expensive houses with air conditions, which cost the country dearly. Nyerere anticipated that doctors from China would be different , simply because they were coming from a Southern country. 171 Coincidentally, the Chinese government had pledged in its Eight Principles of overseas aid tha t: \"[T]he experts dispatched by the Chinese Government to help in construc tion in the recipient countries w ill have the same standard of living as the experts of the reci pient country. The Chinese expert s are not allowed to make any special demands or enjoy any special amenities.\"172 Consequently, while other expatriates working in Tanzania enjoyed good salaries and comfortable living environments better than local medical workers with the same level of e xpertise, the Chinese experts put up with local lifestyle and earnings. Maoist philosophy manifested itself in Ta nzania, for instance, when, in 1970, the Chinese government argued for the reduction of sa laries to Tshs. 400 per month for the Chinese experts working in Zanzibar to adjust to loca l salaries. Part of the letter by Chen Ching, the Chinese Consul in Zanzibar to the Firs t Vice-President, Sheikh Karume read: On behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of China, I have the honour to confirm hereby that following the teachin g of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, to preserve the style of plain living and hard struggle with a view to reducing Zanzibar's burden in its national economy through sel f-reliance, the Chinese Government proposes hereby to lower the standard of living e xpenses of Chinese experts in Zanzibar.173 The argument for \"plain living\" advocated to the Chinese experts was from a view that countries of the Global Sout h, including China, were equal since at different historical periods they experienced similar social, economic , and political predicaments instigated by the 170 \"Italian Doctors Arrive,\" Daily News , July 19, 1977, 1. 171Altorfer-Ong, \"Old Comrades and New Brothers,\" 261. 172 Eight Principles for Economic and Technical Aid Contended by Premier Zhou Enlai when Answering Questions from Reporters of the Ghana News Agen cy on January, 15, 1964 in Ghana, quoted in Afro-Asian Solidarity Against Imperialism: A Collection of Document s, Speeches and Press Interv iews from the Visits of Chinese Leaders to Thirteen African and Asian Countries (Peking: Foreign Languages Press, 1964), 150. 173 Quoted in \"Chinese in Zanzibar to Earn Less,\" The Nationalist , November 20, 1970, 1. 154 impacts of imperialism, col onialism, and neo-colonialism.174 This context enhanced the CMTs' acceptance in Tanzania as the government expected them to steer clear of imperialistic lifestyle. In the same vein, Nyerere antic ipated that doctors from soci alist countries would transmit socialist lifestyles to local doctors thr ough their own positive example. He argued: Ideally, we also need socialists in every jo b-which is not necessarily the same thing as wanting a citizen for every job, because not all Tanzanians are socialists. But if a competent doctor also has socialist attitudes, then he is surely an especially great asset to us. And the truth is that the international reputation of Tan zania is such that many socialists from other countries very much want to come and work with us.175 Alicia N. Altorfer-O ng maintains that CMTs in Tan zania distinguished themselves from medical doctors of the No rth by living in \"dormitory-s tyle sleeping quarters with communal cooking facilities.\"176 Similarly, the Second Vice President of Tanzania, Rashidi M. Kawawa, argued that Chinese doctors were very obliging and capable of living and working in any environment.177 While the sources used for this study confirm that the CMTs endured modest living and working conditions in Tanzania, CMT members did submit a few complaints to the MoH. For example, they were unhappy with old furniture, and they demanded repair as well as the purchase of some stuff such as curtains, air conditioners, cooking utensils, gas cooker and others which were initially perceive d by Nyerere as luxurious amenities. They also complained about old vehicles which the minist ry gave them for an upcountry medical tour. Moreover, in some regions, houses rented for the CMTs were not of low quality since the Tanzanian government paid up to USD 1,500 a month per house. 178 Generally, the CMTs living and working environments varied from one regi on to another, and the MoH addressed several challenges at both national and regional administra tive levels to enable the CMTs to live and work comfortably. CMTs also distinguished themselves fr om other foreign medical experts through distinct practices, especially acupuncture ther apy. Acupuncture was a new and unique way of 174 Read, for instance, \"a speech by Chia o Kuan-Hua, Chairman of the Chinese Delegation and Minister of Foreign Affairs at the 31st Session of the United Nations General Assembly, October 6, 1976,\" TNA.

As esse ntial elements in traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture and moxibustion had a long history in China. The general practice of traditional Chinese medicine in China paralleled biomed icine from the 1950s. After China's Revolution of 1949, acupuncture and moxibustion were widely us ed for therapy in China at all levels of health structure by acupuncturists in traditional Chinese medicine, barefoot doctors in the rural areas and medical doctors in urban areas.179 From its inception in 1968, the CMT program prioritised the practice of acupuncture and moxi bustion therapies in Tanzania, where Chinese acupuncturists were dispatched to the country after every two y ears (Chapter 4). Acupuncture and moxibustion remedies had never been prac tised before by doctors from neither Western nor Eastern countries. The peculia rity of the therapies and thei r effectiveness in addressing more than thirty varieties of diseases won the Chinese medical doctors an appraisal from government officers and patients in Tanzania.180 Working in Ujamaa villages was among dis tinctive features of the CMTs. Such attempts were in line with the socialist health policies which gave priority to rural health care.181 Consequently, the CMT program came at a moment when Tanzania's health care policy and the political ideology had prioritised ru ral health care. To become consistent with the government's health policy, the CMTs spent at least half of their tim e attending patients in villages under their mobile health services.182 For example, in Shinya nga and Maswa Districts, the doctors attended up to 16,500 patients in 19 70. In a single Ujamaa village, the Chinese doctors stayed for more than ten days to take part in village life and work.183 The political elites and community at large perceived the Chinese determinations to work in rural areas as unique since even local medi cal doctors were reluctant to work in villages 179 \"United Nations Development Programme, Project of the Governments of Training Course on Acupuncture Treatment, 17/11/1977,\" TNA.

It contested the colonial health policies in Tanzania, which had neglected rural health care . Yet, it was not limited to Chinese doctors in Tanzania alone. While Chinese doctors spent half of their time in rural Tanzania, Russian doctors did the same in Ethiopia. For instance, in September 1976, five Russian doctors camped at Durge village, Shoa-Ethiopia, to attend to rural patients.

Doctors from other countries cannot adapt to such an environment, while Chinese doctors in those places can work with enthusiasm. Secondly, they [Chinese doctors] know Tanzania very well and understand the problems of the people. Working with the people of Tanzania and helping them is both a challenge and a pleasure to Chinese doctors.185 Such assertions imply that working in rura l areas by the CMTs pleased officials in the MoH and differentiated them from other teams whose doctors were s cared of working in villages. Providing clinical care to rural patien ts won them the hearts and minds of rural villagers who were grateful and others presente d gifts to the CMTs as an expression of their gratitude (Figure 13). Generally, throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the CMTs gave priority to rural health care. Nevertheless, from the end of the 1980s, their services were primarily based in national and referral hospitals preferab ly, in Dar es Salaam, Dodoma, Tabora and Musoma.186 During this period, the roles of the CMTs hardly stressed in spreading communist propaganda; instead, they focused on bolstering th e market for Chinese medicines and painting Sino-Tanzanian relationship. Such new roles did not primarily need the CMTs to work in rural areas. There were structural differences between the CMTs and medical teams from other countries working in Tanzania. Medical assist ance from other countries was mainly provided by a combination of public, private, and multilate ral foundations. Such structure differed from the Chinese system, which, from its inception, remained public and decentralised at the provincial level. The Chinese cen tral government and African c ountries negotiated for medical assistance, but the provinces actually depl oyed the medical doctors to the continent.187 This structure gave Chinese provinces arguably great er control over the CMT program than the central government. As a result, it maintained relationships between re cipient countries and 184 Interview by Andrea Kifyasi with Gallus Namangaya Abedi, June 6, 2018, Posta-Dar es Salaam. 185 Translated from Chinese by Guo Suhang under my request, Health Department of Shandong Province, The Chinese Medical-Aid Team, 32. 186 Interview by Andrea Kifyasi with Edith Bakari, May 8, 2018, MoH Headquarters, Dar es Salaam.

In Tanzania , for instance, investment in traditional Chinese medicine clinics was mostly occupied by traditional Chinese medicine practitioners from Shandong province.188 It is, therefore, fair to contend that the CMT program played a soft power role to ease the penetra tion of provincial hard power through trade and direct investment in Tanzania. Figure 13: A gift of bananas to the CMT (undated, likely 1970s) Source: Health Department of the Shandong Province, Unforgettable Memory, 71. Maintenance cost was among the aspects whic h distinguished the CMTs from medical doctors of other countries worki ng in Tanzania. As hinted earlie r, from 1978, following China's open-door policy, recipient countries paid more to host CMTs. However, comparing to medical teams from other countries, the CMTs were cheaper. For example, while the CMTs working in Tanzania received USD 170 a month by 2 000s, the Cuban doctors received a living allowance of up to USD 300 per mont h per person in the same period. 189 In other countries 188 Interview by Andrea Kifyasi with Sui Guangxin and Chen Zhufeng, March 1, 2016, Jinan. 189 \"Minute, August 31, 2005,\" NRC.

The cheapness of the CMTs fu rther realised in the as pect of flight costs, where the Tanzanian government paid only for the return tickets to the CMTs, but it paid for the round-trip tickets to Cuban doctors.191 Therefore, while Margar et Blunden applauds Cuban medical doctors for their cheap health services to recipient countries,192 this study upholds that despite the changes in China's foreign policy, Chinese doctors were far cheaper than their Cuban counterparts. Nevertheless, the cheapness of the servi ces by the CMTs does not mean that the Chinese government gained nothing from its medical missions. Instead, as discussed in the previous sections, activities of the CMTs in Tanzania promoted market access for Chinese medicines and bolstered diploma tic relations between the two countries. 3.9 Conclusion This chapter has unpacked the history of the CMT program in Tanzania. Discussions in the chapter have contended that the CMTs had a long history, and their execution changed consistently with China's foreign policy. The program cherished Mao's political propaganda from the 1960s to 1970s but was adapted to suit China's economic prioritisations in foreign policy from 1978 onwards. Furthermore, the chap ter has discussed the ways in which the Chinese CMT program positively distinguished itself from medical assistance provided by other nations, which, in turn, made the Chines e government appear as a more responsible and reliable partner than traditional donors of the North. The analyses made in this chapter add weight to the argument by Jeremy Youde, Olivia Killeen and colleagues who hold that China's medical diplomacy extended both hard and soft power. 193 The chapter has shown that the CMT program went hand in hand with the donation of Chinese-made drugs which partly assisted Tanzanians in getting access to basic medicine s while promoting market access and acceptance 190 Daniel Hammett, \"Cuban Intervention in South African Health Care Service Provision,\" Journal of Southern African Studies , 33, no. 1 (Mar. 2007): 76-77. 191 \"Minute, August 31, 2005,\" NRC.

The chapter maintained that the CMT program contributed modestly to promote self-depe ndence in Tanzania's health sector. The program, which has been in place for more than half a century, di d not live up to its claims of capacity building, which would have been key to promoting a sust ainable health care system. Dispatching CMTs to Tanzania overwhelmed training programs a nd joint medical research activities. This situation exacerbated Tanzania's dependence on Chinese doctors up to the present day, as, following Drew Thompson, the Tanzanian health sect or is under serious thr eat by the fact that China's population increase and disease burden will cause some provinces to withdraw their dispatch of medical specialists to Africa.194 194 Drew Thompson, \"China's Soft Power in Africa: Fr om the \"Beijing Consensus\" to Health Diplomacy,\" China Brief 5, no. 21 (October 13, 2005): 4. 161 CHAPTER FOUR: TAKING TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE TO POST- COLONIAL TANZANIA 4.1 Introduction The advent and practice of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in Africa has a long history, yet it has been of limited interest to scholars. The existing research literature dwells much on TCM clinics which emerged from the 1990s while neglecting the emergence and practice of TCM from the 1960s onwards. 1 This chapter, therefore, analyses the ways in which TCM was introduced, perceived, practised and deve loped in post-colonial Tanzania. It shows that TCM was firstly introduced in Tan zania by Chinese navigators in the 15th century. However, it became widespread in 1968 following the dispatch of Chinese medical teams to Tanzania. The chapter goes beyond the previous chapter, which unveiled the history and roles of Chinese medical doctors by unpacking their in fluence on the emergence and spread of TCM in the country. It shows that TCM experts, who accompanied Ch inese medical teams, practised and circulated TCM knowledge among local medi cal workers. Furthermore, commencements of the HIV/AIDS TCM research and treatment in 1987, as well as the anti-malarial campaign in 2006, further enhanced the acceptance and practic e of TCM in the country. This chapter is built on the argument that the practice, spread, and acceptance of TCM knowledge in Tanzania was imperative for the promotion of medical knowledge from the South. In the spirit of Southern solidarity, countries of the South perceived South-S outh knowledge exchange as an emancipatory undertaking against dependenc e on the medical knowledge of the North.2 Nevertheless, the chapter shows that the execution of TCM serv ices in Tanzania was not only envisioned as an alternative to medical knowle dge from the North but also promoted the use 1 General roles of Chinese medical doctors in transmitting TCM in Africa were outlined by Li Anshan, Chinese Medical Cooperation in Africa: With Special Emphasis on the Medical Teams and Anti-Malaria Campaign.

Unfortunately, such promotions did not translate into great success in mainstream Tanzanian public health. 4.2 Traditional Chinese Medicine: The History and the Scope of Its Spread Traditional Chinese medicine relied mostly on herbal medications which were used to prevent and help the human body to fight a ilments, relieve pain and restore health. In addition to medication, TCM adopted non-pharmacol ogical therapies such as acupuncture and moxibustion, massage, cupping and spooning.3 Acupuncture was one of the key components of TCM and began in China around 100 BC. Its acceptance and practice fluctuated depending on China's political atmosphere. Its spread to di fferent parts of the world has a long history as well. For instance, acupuncture and moxibustion th erapies spread to Kore a and Japan in the 6th century AD and Vietnam in the 8th and 10th centuries AD. Acupuncture and moxibustion therapies spread to Europe during the Qing dynasty (1644 -1912). The therapies were practised first in France in the 17th century before its spread to Germany, Holland and England by 1700.4 Some western physicians adopted acupuncture know ledge and used it to re lieve patient pains. By the 1900s, TCM had spread to North America, Asia and several European countries. Portuguese Jesuit missionaries working in Japa n and Asian immigrants, es pecially the Chinese and Vietnamese, were the princi pal agents for practice, and its spread to Europe, Asia and America.5 The advent of biomedicine in the 1900s impacted negatively on the popularity and endurance of TCM not only in Eu rope but also in China. Du ring this era, acupuncture and moxibustion therapies were perceived as unscientific.6 However, after the founding of New China in 1949, the government attached great impor tance to the development of TCM by laying down policies, principles and strategies to pr omote its acceptance and practices (see below). 3 The State Council Information Office of the People's Republic of China (PRC), A White Paper on the Development of Traditional Chines e Medicine (TCM) in China, 6th December 2016 , 4; Interview by Andrea Kifyasi with Jiang Xuan, January 4, 2016, Hangzhou.

Andrew s (New York: Columbia University Press, 2018), 1. 163 Indeed, the government of Mao Zedong promoted TCM within and outside China to preserve the \"essence\" of Chinese culture and spread its fame to the rest of the world. Above all, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) endorsed the development of TCM as a valuable inheritance.7 The promotion of TCM further aimed at backing up western-based medical care in China. In the 1950s, China had a population of half a billio n people who were attended to by fewer than 40,000 biomedical doctors. Conseque ntly, the promotions of TCM partly aimed to enable the Chinese government to utilise about 500,000 TC M practitioners who were at that time disorganised, discouraged and disengag ed in the provision of health care.8 The promotion of TCM went hand in hand with scientising its knowledge. The Vice- Minister for Public Health, Chien Hsin-chung, confessed that most TCM therapies were unscientific; thus, it was necessary to prove their effectiveness through sc ientific research. He argued: The simple yet effective methods of acupuncture and combustion have been known and appreciated by the masses for centuries. Yet much of this skill remained empirical. It lacked a scientifically worked-out theoretical basis. Now the theoretical basis of these methods is being established and it will be possible to atta in even better results in medical treatment with these means.9 Accordingly, since the 1950s, the Chines e government established TCM schools with a standardised curriculum where TCM students and practitioners studied basic biomedical sciences, traditional pharmacotherapy and acupuncture.10 The establishment of formal training not only legitimised TCM as a trustworthy pr actice based on science but also helped the government to unify and regulate the practices of traditional health prac titioners. Besides, the government of China vowed to in tegrate traditional he alth practitioners with biomedicine. Subsequently, the first Chines e health conference held in 1950, endorse d three principles: firstly, to serve the workers, peasants and sold iers; secondly, the prevention of disease; and thirdly, the integration of traditional Chinese me dicine and biomedicine. More importantly, the government stipulated categorically in its constitution that \"both modern medicine and 7 Chien Hsin-chung, \"Chinese Medicine: Progress and Achievements,\" Peking Review , no. 9, February 28, 1964, 18. 8 Birch and Felt, \"The Acculturation an d Re-Acculturation of Acupuncture,\" 51. 9 Medicine,\" 18. 10 and Felt, \"The Acculturation an d Re-Acculturation of Acupuncture,\" 52. 164 traditional Chinese medicine should be developed.\"11 Mao was frequently quoted underscoring that \"Chinese medicine is a great treasure-hou se! We must make all efforts to uncover it and raise its standards.\"12 Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the government stressed training and undertaking research. Thus, it established TCM research institutes in all provinces. Mao endeavoured to see TCM going global and used in parallel with biomedic ine for its survival and prosperity. Not surprisingly, from 1956, China made TCM a compulsory course to students trained in biomedicine to enhance their basic knowledge of TCM and pr omote the use of both medical systems.13 While research is scarce, available pieces of information show that the Chinese introduced TCM to the East Af rican coast already in the 15th century through the expeditions by the Ming dynasty diplomat, Zheng He, to the Ea st African coast, composed of 180 Chinese doctors and medical orderlies. The medical docto rs took care of the de legates and sought new medical knowledge and materia medica from the coast.14 In such ways, medical knowledge from the coast flowed to China through direct contact between Chinese medical practitioners and the coastal traditional medicine practitioners during the expeditions.15 The preceding narratives are si gnificant as they show the interactions, though minimal between traditional medicine practitioners of the two sides. Yet, there is no reliable evidence indicating that Chinese medical doctors extended medical services to the coastal people. Furthermore, there is no plausible information de picting that the coasta l medical practitioners adopted some medical knowledge from Chines e medical practitioners. Nevertheless, Li Xinfeng shows that Chinese descendants wh o were left by Zheng in Mombasa after a shipwreck practised TCM therapies such as massage and cupping. Li adds that Chinese immigrants passed on medical knowledge from one generation to another.16 Li's assertions, however, fall short in terms of methodology as he lacked co mplementary information from archival and archaeological sour ces. It is, therefore, not known whether the Chinese left were 11 WHO, \"Study Tour in China,\" World Health , November 1977, 23; WHO, The Role of Traditional Medicine in Primary Health Care in China, 1985 , 1. 12 Quoted in Birch and Felt, \"The Acculturatio n and Re-Acculturation of 18; Ling Yang, \"Training Medical Workers,\" Peking Review , no. 46, November 13, 1964, 23. 14 Abdul Sheriff, Dhow Cultures of the Indian Ocean: Cosmopolitanism, Commerce and Islam (New York: Columbia University Press, 2010), 296. 15 Sheriff, Dhow Cultures , 298. 16 Li Xinfeng, China in Africa in Zheng He's Footsteps , trans.

Yet, Li's study brings to light the practice of some TCM ther apies on the East African coast before the 1960s. However, their use and spread to other parts of Africa were curtailed by the limited nature of pre-colonial and colonial Sino- African relationships. In the co lonial period, for instance, so- called Chinese \"coolies\" worked in different colonial economic investments in Tanganyika, South Africa and West Africa. 17 However, there is no evidence that these endentured Chinese practised TCM in those colonies. TCM spread intensely in Af rica from the 1960s on. The Ch inese medical team (CMT) program played a substantive role in its introduction, practice and spread (see below). Acupuncture therapy was among the first TCM pract ices introduced in pos t-colonial Africa, starting gradually in the 1960s and booming in the 1970s. The therapy was credited with relieving pains and treating a wide range of h ealth cases. According to the WHO's acupuncture training program of 1977, acupunctu re therapy alone could treat about seventy diseases and some 200 when used in combination with herb al medicines. The acupuncture therapy was especially effective in critical health cases such as bronchitis, bronchial asthma, gastralgia, diaphragmatic spasm, and musculoskeletal problem s such as back pain, knee pain and shoulder stiffness. 18 TCM hinges on the philosophy that concei ves the human body as maintained by \"primordial life energy\" called qi. This theory explains not only the physiology and pathology of the human body but also underpins the aetio logy, prevention, and cure of diseases. TCM practitioners uphold that the qi energy flows throughout the hu man body along several channels called \"meridians\". Thus, the effective flow of qi energy is vital for maintaining a balance between two important natural forces, yin and yang , which, in turn, is required to maintain the stability of the human body.19 In this regard, the occurrence of diseases was attributed to the 17 Read, for instance, Juhani Koponen, Development for Exploitation: Germ an Colonial Policies in Mainland Tanzania, 1884-1914 (M\u00fcnster: LIT Verlag, 1994), 336. 18 Other diseases treated by acupuncture included acute en teritis and dysentery, hypertension, torticollis, malaria, arthritis, lumbago, shoulder pain, acute appendicitis, dysmenorrhoea, tonsillitis, toothache, sequelae instance, \"United Natio ns Development Programme (UNDP), Project of the Governments of Training Course on Acupuncture Treatment, 17/11/1977,\" TNA.

The outlined dimensions made the TCM theory compatible with the WHO's concept of \"health\" which defined it as \"a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity\".21 Consequently, according to TCM theo ry, the imbalanced flow of the qi energy which eventually leads to the occu rrence of diseases was caused by exogenous factors, epidemic pathogenic factors, parasites, emotional changes, improper diet, maladjustment between work, exercise and rest, trauma and the fluid retention as well as blo od stasis. Yet, TCM practitioners did not only rely on symptoms and signs to di agnose diseases. Instead, they employed further diagnostic skills such as observation, listening, smelling, inquiring, and palpation.22 Modes of causations and the types of diseases informed the healing systems. Some patients received herbal doses while others underwent acupunctu re therapy. For the case of acupuncture, TCM practitioners (acupuncturists) inse rted an acupuncture needle(s) into the skin at specific points of the body (acupuncture points) along the meridi an. Inserted needle(s) stimulated sensory nerves under the skin and muscles of the pa tient's body to restore the usual balance of yin and Medicine Vol. I , ed. Ping-chung Leung and Charlie Chang-li Xue (Singapore: World Scientific Publishing, 2005), 44. 20 The yin-yang theory has its background in ancient China. The Chinese believed in the presence of two competing and complementing forces in the universe, the yin and the yang . In their view, the two forces were in everything, including the human body. See Stefan Jaeger, \"A Geomedical Approach to Chinese Medicine: The Origin of the Yin-Yang Symbol,\" in Recent Advances in Theories and Practice of Chinese Medicine , ed. Haixue Kuang (2012), 30; Unschuld, Traditional Chinese Medicine, 25. 21 WHO, Constitution of the World Health Organization, 1946 , 1. The harmonisation of physical and vitality includes stamina, physical appearance and all physiological activities of the human body while the harmonisation of man and nature comprises of seasons of the year , climate and geographical environments. Lastly, the harmonisation of man and society describes man's relations with family, workmates and personal relationships. All the mentioned may affect positively or negatively the flow of qi energy in the human body. For further details read Li Zhao, Kelvin Chan, Kwok-fai Leung, Feng-bin Li u and Ji-qian Fang, \"The C onceptual Framework of the Chinese Quality of Life (ChQoL) Instrument,\" in Chinese Medicine Modern Practice: Annals of Traditional Chinese Medicine Vol. I , ed. Ping.chung Leung and Charlie Chang-li Xue (Singapore: World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd, 2005), 189-191. 44. 22 Under the observation method, TCM practitioners observ e the patient's expression, body shapes, state of the hair, face colour, the five sense organs, throat, limbs, an d skin. Through listening and smelling methods, they take note on how patients speak, breathe, cough and smell. By the inquiring method, they listen carefully to patient's complaints, duration of the illness and the medical history. The palpation method involves feeling the pulse and palpating channels and points. All these techniques have been elaborated on at length by Wen Xuan, \"Traditional Chinese Medicine: An Overview,\" in Traditional Chinese Medicine , ed. Chun-su Yuan, Erick J. Bieber and Brent A. Bauer (Washington: CRC Press, 2011), 97-107. 167 yang for the normal flow of qi energy and, hence, restored health.23 Although TCM theory and practices spread widely, especi ally from the 1970s (see below), western scientists dismissed its conception of disease and healing, claiming that it was unscientific. The placement of needles, for instance, contrasted with the western scientific concepti on of cells, nerve pathways, and energy in biological systems. Under such a pe rception, they categorised TCM therapies as a pseudoscience.24 Nevertheless, the qi theory remained fundamental for the practices of TCM in different parts of the world. Moving away from eastern and western societies to Africa, the Chinese conception of health and diseases varied from the African too. From the pre-colonial period to the present, African societies had a different conception of illness and its aetiology. For instance, in the pre-colonial era, many of the va rious health practices and epis temologies emphasised that the neglect of ancestral spirits caused illness and othe r afflictions to individuals, families, and the general community. Furthermore, they supposed that a particular disease was caused by a \"sorcerer\" when a person died suddenly or had a chronic illness that was unexplainable and progressed rapidly.25 Communities further believed that disrespect of community taboos was capable of causing diseases as a punishment by spirits.26 Moreover, some societies believed that other diseases existed naturally, without any spiritual or social cause.27 African healing systems varied consider ably depending on their aetiology, comprising three levels: divination, spiritua lism, and herbalism. Some dis eases were cured by medicinal herbs and minerals, while others were healed through propitiations or sacrifices to ancestral spirits.28 The healing practices adopted other traditi ons, including biomedicine, from the late 23 Lynnae Schwartz, \"Evidence-based Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine: Not Mutually Exclusive,\" Medical Acupuncture 12, no. 1 (Spring 2000), 2; Yong G.

Following Stacey A. Langwick, Tanzanian patients and practitioners have regarded bi omedical approaches as only part of \"a broader therapeutic ecology\" up to the present.29 Therefore, although biomedicine became entrenched in the colonial period, Tanzanian communities relied on both biomedical and traditional logics of causality and treatment. Although the colonial administration prom oted the use of biomedicine, communities in Tanzania perceived it insufficient in addressing all health problems. Thus, medical pluralism remained the main feature of the Tanzanian health care system in both colonial and post-colonial periods. Accordi ngly, from the moment TCM was introduced and practised in Tanzania, it met communities used to pluralistic health systems capable of absorbing new medical culture. 30 Michael Jennings illustrates how patients in Tanzania were less interested in knowing the philosophical underpinnings of TC M. Instead, they considered mostly the efficacy of their clinical care.31 In such pluralistic contexts, acupuncture spread successfully and was practised in some African hospitals. Countries such as Algeria, Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Mauritania, Somalia, Togo, Tanzania, and Ni ger used acupuncture therapies in some government hospitals starting during the 1960s. Mo reover, Chinese acupuncturists offered free lessons to local medical workers who perf ormed certain operations using acupuncture anaesthesia.32 The provision of free acupuncture le ssons went simultaneously with the establishment of acupuncture departments in some government hospitals in some African countries, including; Tunisia, Camer oon, Lesotho, Namibia, and Madagascar.33 In the 1990s and 2000s, the Chinese introduced an acupuncture c ourse in some African universities such as Conakry University of Guinea, Universida de Eduardo Mondlane of Mozambique, and Madagascar State Public Health School.34 A milestone for training TCM courses to African doctors was reached in 2000 following the in auguration of a Forum for China Africa Cooperation (FOCAC). The first FOCAC meeting held in Beijing came up with a declaration 29 See, for instance, Stacey A. Langwi ck, \"Articulate(d) Bodies: Traditiona l Medicine in Tanzanian Hospital,\" American Ethnologist 35, no. 3 (2008): 428. 30 The reasons why patients in Africa adopted medical pluralism while abstaining from \"knowing\" their philosophies have been discussed at length in Murray Last, \"The Importance of Knowing About Not Knowing,\" Social Science Medicine 15B (1981): 390. 31 Jennings, \"Chinese Medicine and Medical Pluralism,\" 467. 32 Zheng Yang, \"Doctors Bridging Borders: Chinese Doctors Working in Africa Build Cultural Bridges,\" (Aug. 2013): 51. 33 Li Anshan, \"From 'How Could' to 'How Should': The Po ssibility of a Pilot U.S.-China Project in Africa,\" in China's Emerging Global Health and Foreign Aid Engagement in Africa , ed.

The available evidence generally shows that from the 1960s to 2010, Chinese TCM colleges admitted more than 1,000 African students.36 Furthermore, TCM knowledge spread widely and became practis ed in 183 countries, according to China's 2016 White Paper on the Development of Traditional Medicine. Information by the World Health Organization (WHO) states that about 103 states received international approval to practice acupuncture and moxibustion therapies. Its access to insured patients also progressed since about 18 c ountries included acupuncture and moxibustion treatment in their medical insurance up to December 2016. The formal training in medical colleges out of China has also ha d progressive feedback, as more than 30 countries have opened TCM schools to train local TCM practitioners.37 35 Goldon C.

Wherever there is a CMT, even if only one medical point with two persons, one of them must be a doctor of acupuncture.38 Wen Hong, a CMT in Cameroon. The CMT program played a significant role in introducing and popularising acupuncture knowledge. The 2016 China's White Pa per on the Developm ent of Traditional Chinese Medicine shows that 10% of the CMTs di spatched to over 70 countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America comprised TCM professionals.39 Consistently, archival information shows that Chinese doctors have been practising TCM in Tanzania since 1968. The first batch of the CMT included three acupuncturist s who worked in Tarime, Mt wara, and Mpwapwa hospitals.40 Approximately, every batch of CMT included th ree or more acupuncturi sts. In the 1970s, the number of acupuncturists dispatched to Tanzania increased from three of 1968 -70 to six in 1971 -73. From 1973, the number of acupuncturists sent to Tanzania remained constant around six up to 1978.41 The increase in the number of acupunc turists went hand in hand with the spread of its services in differe nt places of Tanzania (Table 9). The reasons for this increase were associated with positive perceptions by Tanzanian patients and the Chinese government endeavour to extend TCM knowledge to countries of the South.42 However, from 1979 onwards, following the reform and opening-up po licy, the number of acupuncturists sent to Tanzania declined to two. Acupuncture therapy was not swiftly introdu ced in Tanzania. In the beginning, local medical workers, political elites, and patien ts had doubts about its efficacy. However, under close persuasion of the Chinese government and the determination of acupuncturists, the therapy began as a trial for a few patients in the 1968 and 1969. Its r eception convinced the 38 Li, Chinese Medical Coop eration in Africa , 18. 39 The State Council Information Office of the PRC, A White Paper , 12. 40 \"Medical Aid to Tanzania, 1968,\" SPA.

Neve rtheless, the number soared in the following years as 36,290 patients were attended in 1977, and about 14,760 patients received ac upuncture therapy in 1978. The decline in the number of acupuncturists sent to Tanzania from 1979 resulted in the decline of the number of patie nts attended.

For example, patients from Kasulu-Kigoma, Western Tanzania, reported positively on the Chinese medical interventions regarding th e treatment of polio. According to archival information, there were many polio cases in Ka sulu throughout the 1970s, which led to the establishment of a special acupuncture centre to tackle the disease. The archival information shows that many patients overcame polio after receiving acupuncture therapies. For instance, a four-year-old child who became paralysed when he was two years old was cured by acupuncturists within three months of the treatment. Similarly, in 1983, a three-year-old child with congenital paralysis was cu red after three weeks of attenda nce at the acupuncture clinic at Muhimbili National Hospital. 47 Unlike other surgeries, acupuncture surgical tr eatment is simple but effective. Patients postulated that they could not feel pains when doctors inserted acupunc ture needle(s) on their bodies. Furthermore, on some occasions, patients we re allowed to eat and drink water, and talk to doctors and their relatives during and/or immediately after the surgery.48 Affirmative acceptance of acupuncture tr eatment influenced local government authorities' requests of acupuncturists in th eir district hospitals. Fo r instance, the development director of Western Lake Province wrote a letter to the regional medical officer requesting the officer to send a special request to the Ministry of Health (MoH) for the dispatch of 46 \"Letter from Mr. Raza A.

Elsewhere in Africa, acupunc ture was credited and endorsed as alternative medicine. In Algeria, for instance, patients perceived acupuncture as an alternative to musculoskeletal health cases which were not efficiently addressed by biomedicine.50 This indicates that many patients di d not perceive biomedical know ledge as entirely capable of diagnosing and addressing all kinds of health issues since some ailments were perfectly diagnosed and treated by traditional medicine s already abundant in Southern countries.51 The practice and popularity of TCM in Ta nzania continued throughout the 1960s, and until the 1980s, but got negatively affected by th e liberalisation policies of the 1990s. In 1993, the Bretton Woods Institutions (BWIs) forced the Tanzania n government to adopt a cost- sharing policy in private hosp itals and clinics (Chapter 3).52 Under the new health policy, patients attended by Chinese acupu ncturists and local doctors paid for the services. The implementation of the policy negatively affected low-income patients, who had enjoyed free health services before the 1990s. However, it al so led to the establis hment of private TCM clinics in major towns and cities of Tan zania. Thus, many patients attended privately established TCM clinics which offered cheap er services than government hospitals.53 However, Elisabeth Hsu noted that an acupunc turist working at Muhimbili National Hospital did not get enough patients to attend in the 1990s. She argued: \"Evidently, the socialist fervour with which acupuncture once used to be promoted had cooled down.\"54 Although the popularity of TCM first developed in public health facilities as indicated above, I argue that the popularity and practice of acupuncture in Tanzania from the 1990s onwards did not diminish as it was cheaply pract ised in private health centres. Under the cost- sharing policy, patients attending government hospitals paid for th e registration fee, 49 \"Letter from Mkurugenzi wa Maendeleo, 1974, Utabibu wa 'Acupuncture'\", TNA. Acc.

To persuade patients, TCM practitioners lowered largely the fees charged to patients in their clinics. For instance, they waived costs related to registrations and lo wered those for consultations and medicines.55 While TCM practitioners charged Tshs. 2500 for malaria dose, the licen sed pharmacy sold a similar dose for Tshs. 6,000.56 Additionally, while TCM clinics waived registration fees, government hospitals charged Tshs 1,000 for re ferral, 500 for regional and 300 for district hospitals.57 Edmund Kayombo, who is also the chairper son of the Traditio nal and Alternative Health Practice Council, argued th at TCM clinics offered cheap health services because, in the 1990s, no strict laws were forcing TCM practitioners to register their cl inics and pay taxes to the government. This context il luminates why TCM clinics va nished after the Tanzanian government passed the Traditiona l and Alternative Me dicine Act in 2002, which, among other issues, obliged registration of the services and annual fees.58 Generally, before the 2000s, patients, especially from low income and ordinary families, preferred attending TCM clinics to government hospitals. The Chinese acupuncturi sts who worked in Tanzania for several decades created a fertile ground for the favourable acceptance of TCM clinics. Chinese acupuncturists did not only offer clinical care but also spread TCM knowledge to the local medical workers through on-site training. Despite a limited number of acupuncturists, their role in communicating ac upuncture knowledge to local medical workers was commendable. Chinese acupuncturists persua ded many Tanzanians to learn and practise acupuncture therapies. From the 1970s, at least every week, they allocated time to offer free acupuncture training to local medical workers. 59 Furthermore, a three- to four-month acupuncture-training course was provided in Kasulu, where acupuncturists under cooperation with the MoH establishe d a training centre (Fig ure 15). In 1975, for instance, about 33 local medical doctors received acupuncture training in Kasulu.60 Training local medical workers did 55 Jennings, \"Chinese Medicine and Medical Pluralism,\" 463. 56 Hsu, \"The Medicine from China Has Rapid Effects,\" 304. 57 \"Principal Secretary, Ministry Ju ly 1, 1993,\" MRC.

While I contended in Chapter four that Chin ese medical doctors did not prioritise the training of local doctors, I argue differently fo r the case of acupuncturists. Their commitment to spreading TCM knowledge stemmed from the fact that TCM drew its background from the Chinese medical philosophy which Chairman Mao vowed to preserve and spread to the rest of the world. Li Anshan states that the advant age which the Chinese government expected from the CMT program was to introduce and spread TCM to recipient countries.61 The devotion of Chinese acupuncturists in training local doctors in Tanzania was commendable. Li adds that in the 1970s, Tanzanian trainees were allowed to practice on bodies of Chinese acupuncturists and to patients under the supervisio n of their trainers (Figure 16).62 61 Li, Chinese Medical Coop eration in Africa , 18. 62 Li, Chinese Medical Coop eration in Africa , 20. 177 Figure 16: An acupuncture trai nee practicing the therapy in Kasulu District, 1975 Source: Health Department, The Chinese Medical-Aid Team , 74. In addition to on-site training, Tanzanians received Chinese government sponsorships for both long and short-term studies to differe nt TCM colleges in China. For instance, from October 1975 to January 1976, 5 Tanzanian medical workers secured three months of training sponsorships about replantation of severed limbs and acupuncture treatment in China. Three doctors (P. M. Sarungi, William Ng'ombe, and Moses Ndosi) registered for a replantation course, two (Hatibu Lweno and Fabian Hoti), admitted for acupuncture.63 The two courses aimed at enabling trainees to acquire new medi cal knowledge and practice them in Tanzania. While the Chinese government sponsorship training on acupuncture to Tanzanians sounds altruistic, it gave China an inexpensiv e opportunity to spread TCM knowledge in the 63 \"Letter from the office of the Embassy of the People's Republic of China in the United Republic of Tanzania, March 8, 1977 to the Principal Secr etary of the MoH,\" TNA.

For instance, in 1976, following the completion of training in acupuncture by Tanzanian medical staff, the Ch inese government gave the MoH two sets of microsurgical instrument and acupuncture therapy apparatuses.65 The donated equipment was necessary for the practice by th e medical staff who completed their training. However, more medical equipment was needed, so the Chinese government recommended the MoH to purchase equipment worth \u00a32,200 to enable local acupuncturists to have a complete set of equipment for their practice. The ministry, however, was sceptical of implementing the suggestion. The statement from th e ministry showed that it was not sure whether three months of training acquainted train ees with enough medical knowle dge to use the equipment correctly. 66 It is, however, important to note here that campaigns advoc ating the use of TCM were not restricted to Tanzania but covered many c ountries of the Global South. The comprehensive promotion of traditional medicine to countries of the Global South in the 1970s gave TCM a chance to penetrate further in Southern countri es. During this period, international agencies sponsored medical workers from the South to undertake TCM training in Beijing. In September 1972, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) signed the \"Basic Agreement\" with China, in which it committed to fund ing projects related to health-manpower development, medical information, traditi onal medicine, pharmaceutical standards, and primary health care (PHC). The UNDP promoted the South-South exchange of traditional medicine knowledge and effective use of herb al plants to address health challenges. 67 The PHC and traditional medicine projects funded by the UNDP since 1972 became the basic health theme at the Alma-Ata conference of 1978, which promoted the realisatio n of the \"Health For All\" agenda by 2000.

Moreover, outside China, TCM was rela tively little practised and few opportunities for studying it existed. Accordingly, Ch ina's Ministry of Public H ealth organised a TCM course in collaboration with the UNDP w ith the WHO as executing agency.69 It is not clear why the WHO promoted TCM training in Global South c ountries. However, plausible reasons include the existence of many health challenges and disease burden among countries of the South. TCM and especially acupuncture therapy would e fficiently address some of such diseases. Moreover, according to David Wondering, ac upuncture therapy was cheaper and less demanding in treating the ailments compared to biomedicine. It demanded fewer and cheaper medical equipment and drugs.70 The UNDP funded both short- and long-te rm acupuncture courses, which were arranged under China's Ministry of Public H ealth through the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Beijing. TCM inst itutions from other cities such as Nanjing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou contributed to the trai ning programme, in particular by giving participants a chance to study the practical application of the techniques in rural areas . The training combined theory with practice and stressed the latter.71 The courses aimed to enable trainees to understand the background of tradit ional Chinese medicine with the emphasis on acupuncture and moxibustion with in view the practical applica tion of the techniques of treatment in their countries. It further aimed to provide the ba sic theory of acupuncture and moxibustion in treatment and give practical training in the t echniques of needle manipulation and moxibustion through lectures, demonstrations, and practice in specia lised institutions, hospitals, and rural 68 See, WHO, Primary Health Care: Report of the International Conference on Primary Health Care, Alma-Ata, USSR, 6-12 September 1978 , 63; \"Letter from the UNDP Office, 14 April, 1977 to the Principa l Secretary Ministry of Health, Multi-Regional Study Tours and Courses in China, 1977-78,\" TNA.

The backing of TCM training by international ag encies did not only legalise its practice but also spread to countries of th e South. Additionally, endorsement of the training signalled global acceptance of TCM knowledge. Generally, from 1968 through the 1990s onwards , the main sponsors of TCM training to Tanzanians were the Chin ese government and the UNDP. Local initiatives to spread TCM knowledge started in the 2000s. The Department of Traditional and Alternative Medicine (DTAM) under the MoH proposed to establish a school for alternative healing mechanisms. Acupuncture and moxibustion were among its prioritised courses.73 Similarly, local TCM practitioners showed interest in communicating TCM knowledge to Tanzanians. For example, doctor Rajabu Bakari Mbilo, who also attend ed a five-year (1989 to 1994) TCM course specialising in acupuncture, moxibustion, and meso therapy in Beijing, showed interests to establish a TCM college in Tanzania. Mbilo also owned a clinic and ha d offered TCM services in the country since March 1995.74 DTAM and local acupuncturists endeavoured to transmit acupuncture knowledge to a more significant numb er of Tanzanians who missed sponsorship opportunities from the Chinese government . Unfortunately, for unknown reasons, the aspirations of establishing colleges for tr aditional medicine di d not materialise. The 2000s further witnessed the engagement of some non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in spreading TCM knowledge, especially acupuncture therapy. Furaha, an osteopathy non-profit organisation, invited tw o Italian acupuncturists to tr ain local medical doctors in Ilula-Iringa, Tanzania. Italia n acupuncturists belonged to the group of Agopuntura Senza Frontiere (ASF)/Acupuncture Without Borders. Th e doctors trained about twelve local medical doctors within nine days a nd awarded them certificates.75 It is not clear whether the nine days ' training course was sufficient for the train ees to practice the ac quired medical knowledge. 72 \"United Nations Development Programme, Project of the Governments of Training Course on Acupuncture Treatment, 17/11/1977,\" TNA.

Its medical knowledge was not spread by Chinese acupuncturists alone but by other nationals as well such as the Italians. The It alian acupuncturists attende d formal training for more than five years, yet and surprisingly they confidently believed that Tanzanian trainees would get acquainted with sufficient ac upuncture knowledge within nine days. I argue that the training arrangements provi ded by Chinese acupuncturists, the UNDP, and other stakeholders did not help trainees acquire suffici ent TCM knowledge to practice effectively and sustainably. By contrast, a study by Li show s that acupuncture therapy was extensively practised by local doc tors in government hospitals in Tunisi a, Cameroon, Lesotho, Namibia, and Madagascar. The countries men tioned established acupuncture departments in government hospitals that admitted a larger number of patients.76 Findings from Tanzania yielded contested results. Despite the efforts invested by Ch inese acupuncturists and support initiatives by the Chinese government through sc holarships, the practice of acupuncture by local medical doctors in government hospitals was less or not execu ted at all. Information from the MoH suggests that local doc tors favoured biomedicine over TCM. For instance, the two Tanzanian doctors, Hatibu Lweno and Fabian Hoti, each having atte nded an acupuncture- training course in 1976, did not practise it. In stead, a few months after completion of the acupuncture course in Beijing, they joined Mu himbili Medical College for further studies in biomedicine.77 This study further showed that Tanzania's MoH lacked aid use st rategy. The ministry sent medical doctors for overseas training w ithout creating favourable plans or conducive environments for trainees to apply the lear ned medical knowledge after completion of their courses. As shown above, the Chinese government was determined to see the actual practice of TCM medical knowledge by th e trainees. It granted Tan zania's MoH two sets of a microsurgical instruments and acupuncture ther apy apparatuses for use by the trained medical personnel.78 However, Tanzania's MoH did not purch ase further equipment as suggested by 76 Li, Chinese Medical Coop eration in Africa , 19. 77 \"Letter from the Office of the Principal Secretary, Ministry of Health, April 9, 1976 to Dr P.

Gallus Namangaya Abedi, a retired Principal Assistant Secretary of the MoH, claims that some officers in the ministry perceived medical knowle dge of Chinese origin as inferior compared to biomedicine. Additionally, Abedi opined that such stereotype was among other reasons which impeded the practice of TCM by the trained medical workers. 80 Nevertheless, negative perceptions over Chinese medical knowledge by some officers in the MoH does not invalidate th e claim that local medical sta ff received insufficient training which did not equip them with useful medical knowledge to attend patients effectively. A Chinese acupuncturist's oral testimony reveal ed that acupuncture know ledge was complicated and required a trainee to fully acquire both phy sical and sensory skills which could not be studied adequately within three months or on site.81 Training for a fully qualified TCM expert takes up to five years in China to achieve Doct or of Medicine (MD) qualifications. The Chinese government summarised the training to three mont hs or less, which did not work in practice for Tanzania's medical workers. The failed practice of acupuncture by local medical doctors in Tanzania was noted with frustration by the Chines e government. In her visit to China on October 17, 2004, the Minister for Health, Anna M. Abdallah had to commit that her ministry would promote the practice of acupuncture to regions and hospita ls where the CMTs worked. However, its implementation was less promising as local medical workers were unable to apply TCM knowledge to patients. For example, the regiona l medical officer of Ta bora requested further TCM training of his medical workers to implement directives from the ministry.82 Thus, despite affirmative acceptance by patients, the practice of acupuncture therapy in government hospitals by local medical doctors remained minimal.

Packard (2016). From the preceding quotation, it is pertinent to mention that although more than forty years have passed since the 1978 endorsement of traditional medicine by the Alma-Ata Declaration, little has change d. Global health interventions still lean much more on biomedicine than on traditional treatments, and the latter is still less studied.84 Similarly, contributions of Southern countries in fighti ng pandemic diseases such as HIV/AIDS have hardly been uncovered. In cont rast, extensive research has b een carried out on the roles of traditional partners in global health campaigns, such as the USA, the European Union (EU), the WHO, the World Bank, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.85 The dearth of research related to contributions of Southern countries into gl obal health created the impression that countries of the South had not hing or little to offer to globa l health challenges. Yet, very little is currently known about Ch ina's multilateral engagement in global health from the turn of 21st century onwards, leaving its bila teral health projects unattended.86 This section neither intends to undermine the roles of traditional global health partners; nor does it seek to glorify the roles of Southern countries in the fight against pande mic diseases.

Recogni sing the disease as a serious threat to global health in th e 1980s, the WHO prior itised the fight against it. Due to the increasing integration of the world's populatio n, HIV/AIDS spread across the globe at an alarming pace. Yet, AIDS had apparently spr ead silently from the mid-1970s until 1981 when the first cases were diagnosed in the US. From there on, reports of AIDS patients increased rapidly from different corners of the world.87 Sub-Saharan Africa was the world's most severely affected region. By the 2000s, it was home to only 10% of the world's population, yet by 2015, an estimated 36.9 million persons were liv ing with HIV, with over 70% of those individuals located in the region.88 Before the turn of the millennium though, in 1983, a surgeon in the Kagera Region of Northwestern Tanzania had recorded Tanzania's first AIDS case. The region was more severely affected than other re gions of Tanzania (Table 10). In the 1990s, the region reported about 16% of all deaths while other regions reported less than 3%.89 From Kagera, the disease spread to different regions of Tanzania. Up to 1990, about 15,227 Tanzanians died of AIDS, and about 21,208 were identified living with HIV. In 1990, AIDS surpassed malaria as the leading killer am ong diseases in both adults and children in Tanzania.90 Up to the present, the disease has rapi dly spread throughout the country, affecting all categories of people in society. Regrettably, the pandemic plagued the Afri can continent amid a period of economic breakdown, thus many states were financially hand icapped and could not a fford to fight against the disease. On the other hand, international heal th agencies focused their attention on primary 87 \"Health Workers Training Modules on HIV/AIDS, Zanzibar AIDS Control Programme, Ministry of Health, Zanzibar, 1990,\" WHOA, File No. A20-370-32TAN-JKT1, GPA-Programme on Information, Education and Communication-Tanzania, 1995, 5; Packard, A History of Global Health , 273. 88 Patterson, Africa and Global Health Governance , 32. 89 World Bank Report, Tanzania AIDS Assessment and Planning Study, June 1992 , iii; Maryinez Lyons, \"Mobile Populations and HIV/AIDS in East Africa,\" in HIV and AIDS in Africa Ezekiel Kalipeni, et al.

HIV/AIDS was missing in the PHC priorities, and global health agencies perceived it as less dangerous.91 For instance, the Danish Director-General visite d Lusaka-Zambia in September 1985 and warned: \"[. . .] if African countries con tinued to make AIDS a 'front-page' issue, the objective of the \"Health for All \" programs by the year 2000 would be lost [. . .] AIDS is not spreading like a bush fire in Africa. It is malaria and other tropic al diseases that are killing millions of children every day.\"92 His assertions were partly appropriate since malaria was indeed a threat to the continent. In Tanzania, for in stance, malaria was the primary cause of deaths throughout the 1980s, accounting for about 10,000 deaths annually.93 Table 10: List of AIDS cases and deaths in Tanzania, 1983 -1986 Year Total Cases Deaths in Hospitals Cases in Kagera Reg. % of Total Cases in Kagera 1983 3 3 3 100 1984 16 16 16 100 1985 266 141 145 54.5 1986 654 170 509 78.0 Total 939 330 673 72.0 Source: \"URT, MoH, AIDS Control Programme, Draft Proposal for a 5-Year Plan, 13 March, 1987,\" WHOA, File No. A20-181-18-JKT1, TSA with the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, National AIDS Task Force, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, in Respect of Strengthening the National AI DS Prevention and Control Programme, 1989, 39. In this vein, WHO officials dismissed AIDS assistance requests made by Uganda and Sierra Leone by the mid-1980s, claiming that \"A IDS was of minor importance compared to other diseases such as malaria.\"94 It took until January 1986 for the WHO to recognise HIV/AIDS as a major public health concer n. In May 1986, the World Health Assembly launched a special programme on AIDS that would later be named the Global Programme on AIDS (GPA). This programme was reconstitu ted in December 1995 as a new joint United Nations programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS).95 Under the GPA, HIV/AIDS was conceived as a behavioural problem caused by having sex with multiple partners and tied to cultural 91 Read Chapter 8 in Iliffe, The African AIDS Epidemic ; also see Packard, A History of Global Health , 279; 92 Quoted in Iliffe, The African AIDS Epidemic , 68. 93 World Bank Report, Tanzania AIDS , 4. 94 Packard, A History of Global Health , 279. 95 WHO, Global Strategy for the Prevention and Control of AIDS: Report by the Director General, 1988 , 6; Packard, A History of Global Health , 282. 186 practices such as polygamy. Thus, the GPA promptly transmitted behavioural and sex education, and distributed condoms to raise globa l awareness and reduce the pace at which the disease spread.96 Tanzania, like many other African countries , tried several means to get rid of the disease. This included the use of local medical experts, who embarked on extensive research in both traditional medicine and biomedicine to find suitable drugs to cure the disease.97 In May 1985, it formed a National AIDS Task Force (NATF) - later renamed the national AIDS Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) - to advise the government on control measures. From March 1987, the committee received financial and technical assistance from the WHO and other donor agencies which enabled the formula tion of a medium-term plan (MTP) for dealing with the disease. The MTP aimed to monitor the progression of the disease, decrease the transmission by blood transfusion, reduce moth er-to-child transmission, improve diagnostic capabilities, and decrease transmission through education.98 These activities were to a large extent undertaken by the National AIDS Contro l Program (NACP), which was officiated in 1988. Under its four technical units, the NACP de alt with prevention, diagnosis, and research.99 The government endeavoured to succeed in the fight against the disease. However, up to the moment when it requested assistance from the Chinese government, the fight against HIV/AIDS had not generated pr omising results. With the s upport from the WHO and other traditional donor countries of the North, medical e xperts in Tanzania were only able to identify affected patients, recognise the HIV/AIDS viruse s, and decrease the pace of transmission. Yet, they were unable to treat the disease effectiv ely. Moreover, treatmen ts by both biomedicine and traditional Tanzanian medicine were provi ded for some opportunistic diseases such as tuberculosis, prolonged diarrhoea, and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). 100 At this point, the Tanzanian government needed and welcomed support from countries with more advanced and promising medical knowledge to eliminate the disease. 96 \"MoH, Brief on the NACP,\" 14; WHO, Global Strategy for the Pr evention and Control of AIDS , 5. 97 J.

Nyerere's trip to China. The positive reputation of the Chinese doctors who had been working in the country since 1968, plus inadequate measures taken by the WHO and other traditional global health partners against the disease, prompted the government to turn to Chinese aid. 101 Subsequently, the Chinese President, Deng Xiaoping, accepted the request of the government presented by Nyerere and promptly ordered the Ministry of Health to di spatch medical experts to the country and carry out an anti- HIV/AIDS research and treatment project using TCM. In the absence of therapeutics or a vaccine, Deng hoped traditional herbal medicines w ould provide an alternative solution to the virus.102 Indeed, the acceptance of the request rekindle d hope that it would be possible to fight HIV/AIDS, since to combat the disease, Tanzania needed both financial assistance and medical knowledge. Moreover, to a large number of trad itional medicine researchers and practitioners in the country, the use of traditional medicine was a promising attempt at effective knowledge exchange. China 's assistance for HIV/AIDS research to Tanzania came when its interest in Africa had lessened, following its reform and opening-up policy of 1978. During this period, policies and practices of assistan ce shifted, and the new relationship was one of investment and profit - the era of Mao and Zhou Enlai was over, even though the theme of \"friendship\" and the era of cooperation be fore 1980 were recalled strategically in diplomatic speeches.103 Yet, it still became possible for the Chinese government to devote resources to research and treatment of the disease since the project held promising scientific, economic, and political potential for its government. Moreover, the long-term friends hip between Nyerere and Deng influenced the Chinese government to accept Nyerere 's request. 104 Consequently, in May 1987, Tanzanian and Chinese health authoritie s signed a cooperation agreemen t on researching and treating HIV/AIDS. The Chinese government committed to dispatching teams of TCM experts to Tanzania to cooperate with local doctors of Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH) on research 101 Interview by Andrea Kifyasi with Gallus Namangaya Abed i, June 6, 2018, Posta-Da r es Salaam; Joseph W.

MoUs were signed every three year s, based on negotiations that either added or deleted some items according to changing demands.105 The commencement of Chinese-funded HIV/AI DS research positively influenced the flow of more research projects from local and foreign expe rts. In 1989, Swiss medical staff and local medical workers conducted joint HIV/AIDS research at Mwananyamala Hospital in Dar es Salaam.106 While the Chinese research was based on TCM, the Swiss research project centred on biomedicine. Similarly, in 1990, local medical practitioners established a traditional Tanzanian medicine research centre dealing wi th HIV/AIDS in Tanga. The centre, famously known as Tanga AIDS Working Group (TAW G), was interdisciplinary, comprising conventional physicians, traditional healers, soci al scientists, and botanists. TAWG researched and treated HIV/AIDS patients with plant-based medicines.107 In the same period, the Institute of Traditional Medicine (ITM) and traditional medicine practitione rs from about eleven regions of Tanzania engaged in research searching for efficacious traditional medicine to cure HIV/AIDS.108 All of this shows that there were both internal and external initiatives to fight the disease in Tanzania. The Chinese-funded project o fficially launched its activi ties in Dar es Salaam in September 1987. The China Academy of Chines e Medical Sciences (CACMS, formerly the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine) was responsible for di spatching experts to run the project together with local doctors from the MNH of Tanzania.109 TCM experts were recruited from different hospitals a nd institutes under CACMS, such as Guang'anmen and Xiyuan hospitals, as well as the Institute of Basic Theory for Chinese Medicine (Table 11). The CACMS was established in 1955 and was repute d for hosting famous TCM specialists. It 105 Interview by Andrea Kifyasi with Liggyle Vumilia, May 7, 2018, Dar es Salaam.

By that ti me no HIV/AIDS cases had been officially announced in China; the firs t cases would only be in 2001.111 Tanzania, therefore, marked the first place for CACMS to research and treat HIV/AIDS. The research team sent to Tanzania comprised up to six experts per batch, which included TCM pharmacists and physicians. Chines e experts worked toge ther with one local pharmacist who was in charge of monitoring th e safety of the drugs, and one local physician who was in charge of management and handling patients. A few local nurse assistants were also engaged in the research work assisti ng the Chinese and local researchers. The TCM experts' tenure was unsystematic; some experts stayed for one year, others for two. Over the 31 years, up to 2018, the CACMS dispatched to Tanzania 16 batches with a total of 66 TCM experts (Table 11). Together, they conducted research and attended to more than 10,000 HIV/AIDS patients in Tanzania.112 The Chinese Ministry of Finance primarily sponsored the HIV/AIDS research and treatment project. It carried expenses related to the domestic salaries of the experts, travelling expenses from China to Tanzania, language training, medical equipment and medicines.113 The Tanzanian government met costs related to trav elling expenses from Tanzania to China, lodging, house maintenance, water and electricity bills as well as phone expenses. Furthermore, it hired security guards and cleaners for doctors' residence, drivers and 50 litres of fuel every week for vehicles used for the work.114 The Tanzanian government also paid TCM experts 110 \"Taarifa Fupi ya Safari ya Jamhuri ya Watu wa China 16-23 Julai 2006,\" NRC.

The HIV/AIDS outpatient clinic was estab lished shortly after signing the agreements between the CACMS and the MNH.116 Although TCM experts la cked experience in both therapy and research, they promptly started giving clinical care to patients.

An article published on October 15, 2006 in Xinhua News Agency, reported that according to TCM doctors HIV/AI DS was \"jointly caused by the invasion of wrong and bad qi from outside the human body and unint ended discharge of right and good qi from within the body.\"117 Thus, they believed that patients would recover if several formulae of tested herbs would adequately address the two problems mentioned. Consequently, TCM experts did not begin with an extensive stud y of the virus and other related scientific procedures. Instead, they directly engaged in trial-a nd-error practices on patients. They began providing TCM drugs capable of reducing th e viral load and maintaining patients' body immunity while exploring efficacious medicinal herbs for curing the disease.118 Thus, the TCM trial-and-error treatment began before the WH O's guidelines underscoring clinical evaluation of the safety and possible efficacy of traditional remedies in the treatment of persons with AIDS before any clinical tria l. However, the WHO set up new guide lines in 1990, after it had noticed that practitioners used herbal remedies to treat HIV/AIDS patients without any scientific proof that they possessed anti-HIV potency.119 Thus, from 1990, clinical evaluation for the efficacy and safety of the medicine before clinical trial was mandatory. Indeed, clinical trials carried some risk to patients, which would either be caused by adverse side effects or lack of information on the efficacy of the agent unde r study. Information reporting severe risks encountered by HIV/AIDS patients w ho used TCM was not available. As a matter of practice, TCM experts asse ssed the clinical progress of HIV/AIDS patients by examining physiology, psychology, social relations, and indepe ndence. With regard to physiology, they examined the physical discom fort of a patient befo re and after using TCM by determining whether a patient encountered fever, diarrhoea, cough, headache, weight loss, and other related diseases. The experts examin ed the psychological status of a patient by considering both negative and positive conditions . They noticed a negative condition if a 117 Qi meant the flow of vital energy in the human body, read in \"Traditional Chines e Medicine in Tanzania,\" Xinhua News Agency , October 15, 2006, see also Wei-bo Lu, \"Approaches in Treating AIDS with Chinese Medicine,\" in Chinese Medicine Modern Practice: Annals of Traditional Chinese Medicine Vol. I , ed.

At the same time, th ey noted a positive state if a patient felt confident with the treatment and was gaining new hope in life. They also examined the patient's social relationships - namely the patient's relation ships with doctors, colleagues, and family members at home. Moreover, they exam ined a patient's ability to act independently through the patient's engage ment in daily activities.120 These aspects of the assessment imply that TCM experts did not follow a reductionist approach in fighting HIV (as was the case of orthodox health practitioners); instead, they employed a holistic approach viewing the human body and mind in their entirety. The experts designe d scoring tables for each patient, detailing clinical progress before and after using TCM unde r each of the mentioned rubrics. The scores manifested the usefulness of the deployed form ulae and were the basis for experts' decisions regarding patients' further clinical treatment. In the beginning, patients doubted the ability of the Chinese medical team to address HIV/AIDS using TCM. This was because patien ts had never heard about the engagement of TCM practitioners in any research, nor had Chin ese practitioners had previous experience in addressing HIV/AIDS.121 Furthermore, the clinic was established during a time when suspected patients faced fierce stigma. The community per ceived HIV/AIDS as a disease of shame and sin.122 This negatively impacted patients' attendance at the clinic. Some patients were afraid that their communities would shun th em if they had contact with other patients. This prevented some patients from attending clinical care, while others requested that they attend the clinic secretly. Yet, others preferred visiting private traditional medicine clinics where confidentiality was better guaranteed. 123 Clear statistics showing patients' turnout ar e missing. However, oral testimonies show that many patients attended the clinic over time.

A patient and a doctor whom I interviewed ar gued that many Tanzanian women were more courageous and caring than men regarding thei r own health and that of their children. Therefore, the turnout of male patients was less promising, and most of them could not endure regular attendance at the clinic.125 Doctor Naomi Mpemba adds that this was a challenge to boosting patients' immunity because patients who did not accompany their spouses to the clinic continued to have sexual relatio nships with their husbands or wives whose viruses were more active.126 When the clinic was founded, attending patient s were from MNH, mostly residents of Dar es Salaam City and a few from other region s of Tanzania. Over time, patients from nearby regions, including Coast, Tanga, and Morogoro star ted attending the clinic . Plans to extend the service to many regions of Tan zania were underway, pending fina l results of this research. However, throughout its existence, the clinic woul d not take its services to other regions of Tanzania. These remained solely based at the MNH for further research and clinical trials.127 Throughout the 1980s and the 1990s, the TCM clinic was generally positively perceived, and it attended to many patients. Nevertheless, with the advent of western antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) in 2004 the positiv e reception of the clinic decreased. Many patients left the clinic and opted for ARVs. Ot her patients went back and forth between using ARVs and receiving TCM clinical treatments.128 Generally, patients were looking for a cure, irrespective of whether it would be ARVs or TCM. Some patients who had attended the TCM clinic since the 1980s and the 90s and had experienced few health improvements were tired of TCM and wanted to try a new medication. Th erefore, from 2004 onwards the number of patients attending the TCM clinic decreased.

This is reflected in the fourth of the Eight Principles for Economic and Technical Aid referred to by Premier Zhou in Ghana on January 15, 1964: \"in providing aid to other countries,\" he said, \"the purpose of the Chinese gove rnment is not to make the r ecipient countries dependent on China but to help them embark on th e road of self-reliance step by step.\"130 Nearly two decades later, this was still the publicly proclaimed official policy voiced by Premier Zhao Ziyang during his visit to Africa from December 1982 to January 1983. In his speech made in Dar es Salaam, he reaffirmed that \"economic and techno logical cooperation should contribute to self- reliance on both sides.\" 131 Such commitments imply that the HIV/AIDS research and treatment project had a role to play, especially in boosting the capacity of Tan zania's health sector to enable the country to address the disease independentl y. This would indeed have been the case if the project had boosted Tanzanian abilit ies through the exchange of medi cal knowledge between TCM experts and local medical practitioners. Likewise, sin ce the research focused on exploring efficacious antiretroviral herbal medicines, it had merits in promoting the use of me dicinal plants abundant in Tanzania. Consequently, local traditional medicine researchers and practitioners, who were also searching for suitable herbal medicine to suppress the disease, became important stakeholders. However, from its inception, the research project conformed to neither the South- South knowledge exchange agenda nor to self-reliance commitments. The project denied full inclusion of local medical doctors as well as traditional medi cine researchers and practitioners. As mentioned earlier, a team of traditional Tanzanian medicine practitioners and researchers 129 Interview by Andrea Kifyasi with Bai Wenshan, Ma y 28, 2019, Beijing China; Naomi Vuhahula Mpemba, August 1, 2018 at Goigi Mbezi Beach, Dar es Salaam. 130 Quoted in Afro-Asian Solidarity against Imperialism: A Collection of Documents, Speeches and Press Interviews from the Visits of Chinese Leade rs to Thirteen African and Asian Countries (Peking: Foreign Languages Press, 1964), 149. 131 Quoted in Mengua Zeng, \"An Interactive Perspectiv e of Chinese Policy: A Case Study of Chinese Aid to Tanzania,\" (PhD diss., Graduate School, University of Florida, 1999), 101. 195 from the ITM conducted their research in Tanga and Dar es Salaam resp ectively. In contrast, TCM experts conducted their res earch in Beijing and Dar es Salaam. Regrettably, the groups did not share knowledge. The agreements reach ed between the two governments contributed to the exclusion of local researchers from the Chinese led research. In res ponse to Nyerere's request to the Chinese governme nt, Deng proposed that TCM specia lists lead the fight against HIV/AIDS. Thus, from the begi nning, the leadership role assigned to Chinese specialists precluded collaboration on an equal footing between TCM experts and local traditional medicine researchers, a collabo ration which was key to promo ting South-South production and exchange of medical knowledge. Definitely, th e dominance of TCM knowledge in HIV/AIDS research and treatment in Tanzania was more or less comparable to the approach of traditional global health partners whose interventions to pandemics were also pow ered by their faith in the superiority of their me dical knowledge and technology. 132 In Africa as a Living Laboratory: Empire, D evelopment, and the Problem of Scientific Knowledge, 1870 -1950 , Helen Tilley shows how colonialists capitalised on Africa's research potential to produce and transmit their medical knowledge on the continen t. The colonialists perceived the prevalence of several diseases on th e continent as an important asset to clinical trials regarding numerous biomedical formulations.133 Findings from the present study suggest that, paralleling Tilley's conception of \"scientific colonialism,\" the Chinese HIV/AIDS project maintained the supremacy of TCM in Tanzania . The agreements between the Tanzanian MoH and the CACMS denied local medical doctors' o pportunities to either ga in medical knowledge from TCM doctors or to share such knowledge with TCM doctors. Chinese experts dominated research activities. Under the signed MoU, lo cal personnel were responsible for organising patients, taking serology, dia gnosis of patients, clinical observations, and conducting laboratory tests such as routine blood tests. In contrast, TCM experts were tasked with designing a clinical implementation plan, checki ng the assay report, clinical diagnoses and treatment, as well as filling clinical monitoring forms - jobs which, according to Elisabeth Hsu, were all filled by Chinese people.134 Furthermore, the CACMS we re in charge of producing and distributing TCM and other medical facili ties necessary for rese arch and treatment.135 132 Packard, A History of Global Health , 9. 133 Helen Tilley, Africa as a Living Laboratory: Empire, Development, and the Problem of Scientific Knowledge, 1870-1950 (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2011), 2. 134 Hsu, \"Medicine as Business,\" 228. 135 \"The Memorandum of Continuing Cooperation on the 7th Period of HIV/AIDS Treatment with TCM between The China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, The People's Republic of China and The Muhimbili National 196 According to the agreements, TCM experts we re responsible for a ll activities related to the extraction of chemicals, laboratory experiments, and medicine productions. The local medical doctors were to assist the experts. Ther e was a less tangible scientific investment in terms of laboratory and other me dical and research equipment at MNH than in clinical care. TCM herbal formulations were prepared in Ch ina and imported into Tanzania for clinical trials.136 This dominance of Chinese specialists in research is an instance of what Tilley calls \"scientific diaspora\", which refers to the in troduction of new scient ific knowledge into a foreign land while the convenor's staff retains total control of it.137 This study argues that the failure of Chines e-funded health projects in Tanzania was already rooted in the conception of the projects. The Chinese HIV/AIDS project, as established in the MoU between the MNH and the CACMS, was ill conceived. While CACMS dispatched TCM experts for the research, MNH deployed biomed ical doctors to work in the project. Such ill-fated agreements were re ached while, in 1974, the gover nment, through the Muhimbili Medical College, established the Traditional Medicine Research Unit (TMRU). The latter was upgraded to an Institute of Traditional Medi cine (ITM) in 1991. The institute had a dozen senior researchers including chemists, pharmacologi sts, botanists and medical anthropologists. Nevertheless, only one pharmacologist from IT M was partially attached to the project, effectively eclipsing the most significant Tanzanian partner. 138 Undoubtedly, if the partnership between these two institutions (ITM and CACMS) that specialise in the same area had been adequately thought out, the research proj ect on HIV/AIDS would have contributed considerably to the production and exchange of medical knowledge. The MNH would have been engaged only for the clinical trial.

Regarding the latter, more than six formulae of herbs were tested up to 2006 - but with little success. The medical analysis showed that many of the formulae were 40 to 50% effective in fighting HIV/AIDS. Nevertheless, the general health status of at least 75% of HIV/AI DS patients using TCM improved.140 The tested formulations reduced viral loads, thereby improved patients' body immunity and extended their lives. Doctor Mpem ba, who also worked at the clinic for more than twenty years, noted that : \"We received patients whose body immunities were severely affected by HIV. However, after they star ted attending the clinic, their body immunities improved, and others became strong enough to resume their daily activities.\"141 She added that: \"TCM extended the lives of patients. Others lived for more than ten years, and a few of them are alive. They usually welcome me for friendly talks and family functions, including birthdays and graduation ceremonies of their children.\"142 In addition to enhancing immunity, Doctor Amunga Meda, who also worked at the clinic, repor ts that Chinese herbs improved patient quality of life by alleviating common diseases su ch as fever, fatigue, abdomen pains, cough, asthenia and severe diarrhoea.143 These assertions corresp onded with responses from HIV/AIDS patients who attended th e clinic.

Although the patient was not healed, her immunity was strengthened, and she resumed office work.145 These testimonies support the conclusion that TCM lengthened lives and re duced death rates of HIV/AIDS patients. The preceding statements suggest that TCM therapies functioned similarly to western ARVs. However, Doctor Wang Jian,146 who also worked at the HI V/AIDS clinic in Tanzania, claims that TCM had added merits compared to western ARVs. According to him, the western ARVs focused on getting rid of symptoms; TC M instead addresses the root cause of the disease. Wang added that: TCM stimulates the patient's own upright qi energy that prevents external pathogenic invasions from entering the body, while the goal of western medicine [ARVs] is to kill bacteria or viruses by using chemicals. TCM combines many kinds of herbs to exert [a] greater effect, regulates the body's internal environment [helping it to] regain in its balance in holistic approach.147 Wang's view implies that TCM intended to increase the defensive capabilities of a patient's immune systems, which were more suscepti ble to HIV. By contrast, ARVs focused on the suppression of HIV. Bai Wenshan, who also worked at HIV/AIDS clinic in Tanzania, reaffirms that TCM did not focu s on ridding the patient of the vi rus; this shortcoming, in his view, defeated the quick effectiveness of TC M over western ARV. In this vein, HIV/AIDS patients whose body immunities were severely a ffected did not withst and measures employed by TCM.148 One patient reported that her husband, who suffered from deficient body immunity, died four years after st arting to use TCM, while she hersel f survived since she started using TCM when her body immunity was still high.149 144 Interview by Andrea Kifyasi with HIV/AIDS patient \"A\", April 9, 2019, Mlimani City, Dar es Salaam. 145 \"Traditional Chinese Medicine in Tanzania,\" Xinhua News Agency , October 15, 2006. 146 Dr Wang Jian was the Deputy Director of the TC M Centre for AIDS Prevention and Treatment, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences (CACMS). He wo rked on HIV/AIDS Treatment with TCM for more than 22 years, and he spent thr ee years at MNH in the 1990s. 147 A response by Dr Wang Jian quoted in, Wang Jian, \"Fighting AIDS with TCM,\" China Academic Journal, Electronic Publishing House, 2013. 148 Interview by Andrea Kifyasi with Bai Wenshan, May 28, 2019, Guang'an men Hospital, Beijing China; see also Lu, \"Approaches in Treating AI DS with Chinese Medicine,\" 57. 149 Interview by Andrea Kifyasi with HIV/AIDS patient \"A\", April 9, 2019, Mlimani City, Dar es Salaam. 199 The other notable distinction between TCM and ARVs concerned side effects, with TCM associated with fewer side effects than ARVs.150 Mpemba, who was also responsible for handling all matters related to HIV/AIDS patients, informs that they received fewer complaints from patients regarding side effects of TCM. In her experience, the reported complaints were not only fewer but also less complicated th an those observed in patients using ARVs.151 An informant who used TCM therapies from 1990 to 2010 affirmed that she did not incur complicated side effects; she did, however, sometimes experience simple diarrhoea and pruritus.152 The subjective belief that herbal me dicines have fewer side effects than biomedicine influenced such contrast. Despite its merits, the TCM research pr oject was closed in 2006. The 18 years of research did not produce profound results. Up to 2006, no specific medicine was endorsed for the treatment of the disease. While informants claimed that there were formulae which proved useful in fighting the virus, the CACMS di d not approve any of them. Rogasian Mahunnah complained: The Chinese did not endorse useful formulae fo r patients' use. Instead, they withdrew the formulations and sent their reports to China for further research. After the withdrawal, new formulations were developed and imported to Tanzania for a clinical trial. Chinese doctors used Tanzanian patients for the trial of their medicines since there were no HIV/AIDS patients in China. 153 Seemingly, officers at the MoH and local rese archers were tired of endless clinical trials with little triumph. Correspondingly, loca l people mistrusted of Chinese researchers. Criticism like Mahunnah's explains why local tr aditional medicine researchers perceived Chinese experts only used HIV/AIDS patients in Tanzania as guinea pigs.154 A further point of the presen t study is that inadequate transparency in the project prompted local traditional medical researchers to develop negative perceptions of Chinese 150 Interview by Andrea Kifyasi with HIV/AIDS patient \"A \", April 9, 2019, Mlimani City, Dar es Salaam.

Tanzanian informants expressed their worries, maintaining that Chinese experts might have developed the tested formulations in Ch ina and produced antiviral herbal medicine for sale without acknowledging research partners.155 These uncertainties were rooted in the fact that the CACMS owned intellectual property rights over the research project. In this regard, Elisabeth Hsu noted that in 2000s, the Chinese globally sold a Chinese-made antiviral herbal medicine with the brand name Aikeji . 156 It is not precisely known whether the medicine was produced by CACMS using the formulae they tested in Tanzania or otherwise. Although the research was officially ended, China and Tanzania agreed to formally commence using the tested medicines. By 2006, the HIV/AIDS clinic tested more than six TCM formulae, with four yielding promising results. Thus, the CACMS endorsed one of the four useful formulae under the brand name Eling for patient use. Since the medicines were produced in China, they were regula rly imported according to patients' demand.157 Such imports were consistent with the signed MoU, which allowed the Chinese to produce pharmaceuticals. 158 Agreements like these, however, turned the Tanzanian government dependant on Chinese medicines. Furthermore, the discontinuation of the re search gave birth to the Sino-Tanzanian TCM Centre. The centre, whic h was housed at MNH, expande d its research on TCM beyond HIV/AIDS. In addition to attendi ng to patients with HIV/AIDS, it also attended to diseases treatable by TCM such as asthma, diabetes, hi gh blood pressure and pneumonia. Also, from 2006, TCM research was conducted for other hea lth cases and not for HIV/AIDS. Under the 2006 agreement, since the laborious HIV/AIDS research work had ended, the number of TCM experts dispatched to Tanzania was reduced to three.159 The establishment of the centre was another attempt at promoting the use of TCM in Tanzania. The agreements reached in 2006 155 Interview by Andrea Kifyasi with Febronia C. Uiso and Edmund J. Kayombo, June 8, 2018, Institute of Traditional Medicine (ITM).

In contrast, local medical workers were responsible for the managerial activities of the Centre.161 Undeniably, TCM research projects influenced the adoption and use of a new medical culture rather than empower the development of local medical know ledge. That several TCM formulations were trialled on Tanzanian patients shows that the country was a captive s ubject to scientific experiments in both the coloni al and post-colonial periods. Furthermore, the TCM centre promoted a mark et for Chinese herbal medicines. Under the 2006 MoU, the Chinese government provided free medicine to HIV/AIDS patients while charging patients suffering other diseases incl uding asthma, blood pressure, diabetes, and rheumatism. In the MoU, the Chinese government committed itself to charging patient fees for the basic cost of medicines only, \"w ithout any purpose of making a profit\". 162 However, the basic cost of medicines was left to be determ ined by the Chinese side since its government was responsible for the purchase, transport, and stor age. It is, therefore, difficult to determine whether they made profits out of the fees char ged or not. Distribution of revenues shows that the Tanzanian side benefitted from registration and consultation fees, while the Chinese benefitted from medicine fees charged to patients. 163 While this sounds lik e a win-win deal, its execution supported the use and market for Chinese herbal medicines. 160 \"Summarisantimalared Minute of Meeting between Mi nistry of Health and Social Welfare of the United Republic of Tanzania and State Administration of Traditio nal Chinese Medicine of the People's Republic of China on Continuing Cooperation of Treatment of HIV/AIDS, Signed in Beijing on July 17, 2006,\" NRC.

The clos ure of the centre limite d access to data, so it is difficult to find data related to the reasons for its decline. However, information I have, shows that the contract for the centre was not renewed because the Dar es Salaam port authorities detained Chinese medical equipment and herbal medicines imported to Tanzania.164 Respondents did not openly mention the reasons behind this c onfinement. Nevertheless, from 2016, the MNH and CACMS agreed to promote institutional re lationships through exchanging medical experts to ease the sharing of medical knowledge. Th e CACMS agreed to send TCM experts to Tanzania to train local traditional medicine rese archers and practitioners, but this plan did not come to fruition as the two sides voiced disagr eements over the terms of its execution in 2018.165 4.5 TCM and China's Anti-malaria Campaign in Tanzania, 2006-2010 Malaria is the primary killer disease on the African continent. According to the WHO's World Malaria Report of 2005, about 107 countries and territories were malaria epidemic areas, with countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, South-East Asia , Pacific, and Latin America being the most vulnerable to the diseas e. The report added that the disease infected about 500 million people and caused 3 million ca ses of death annually, 80% of which occurred in Africa and most of them we re pregnant women and children under five years. Moreover, low-income families in Africa spent one-fourth of their annual income on malaria treatment. Malaria consumed 1.3% of annua l GDP of African countries.166 This situation implies that malaria has been a consistent major threat to public health and a barrier to the economic development of African countries. In Tanzania , for instance, the 1999 MoH information shows that about 4,000,000 malarial cases were reported each year which was equivalent to 34.2% of 164 Interview by Andrea Kifyasi with Hedwiga Swai, Ju ly 18, 2018, Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH), Dr Swai is a Director of Medical Services at MNH; Amunga Meda, September 19, 2018, Muhimbili National Hospital. 165 Interview by Andrea Kifyasi with Bai Wenshan, Ma y 28, 2019, Guang'anmen Hospital, Beijing China. 166 \"Memorandum of understanding between Department of Aid to Foreign Countries, Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China and National Malaria Control Program, Ministry of Health and Social Welfare of the United Republic of Tanzania, April 19, 2006,\" NRC.

The 2000 information added that malaria accounted for about 100,000 Tanzanian deaths annually.167 China was one of the most severe epidem ic areas affected by malaria. During the 1960s and 1970s, there were two epidemic outbr eaks which infected more than 20 million people. The malarial epidemics endowed China w ith experiences in the prevention and cure of malaria using TCM. Artemisinin and its semis ynthetic derivatives were discovered in 1972 by Tu Youyou, a Chinese scientist a nd 2005 co-recipient of Nobel Pr ize in Medicine. The therapy contained four derivatives; di hydroartemisinin, artesunate, arte mether, and arteether, which effectively worked against malaria parasites. The WHO officially appr oved the medicine in 1993. Artemisinin was extracted fr om Chinese herbal plant, Artemisia annua, and was used for curing several ailments, including malaria since ancient times.168 Artemisinin was efficacious against all forms of malaria parasites. In th e 1990s, it surpassed sul phadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) in treating malaria.169 China's rich experience, professional pe rsonnel, and anti-malarial medicine had benefitted the anti-malarial campaign in Tanz anian and Africa at large. After the WHO approval of artemisinin, China sought to popu larise the therapy on th e African market in several ways. For example, in the 2000 Forum on China Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) held in Beijing it came up with the Beijing Declaration of the Ministerial Forum on China-Africa Health Development. Under the Declaration, he alth ministers and officials from China and African countries committed to embarking on new efforts of finding and implementing sustainable health solutions for several he alth cases, malaria being in the front. 170 China's anti-malaria campaign in Africa increased in 2006, when it built thirty hospitals, provided renminbi 300 million yuan of grant for purchasing Chinese-made 167 \"National Institute for Medical Res earch (NIMR), The Commercialization of Local Production of Artemisinin, 2006,\" NRC.

More than 60 Africans from different recipient countrie s, including Tanzania, atte nded the ten-day course.172 In the FOCAC meeting of 2009, the Chinese government comm itted to providing Ren Minbi 500 million yuan worth for medical equipment and other materials fo r fighting against malaria to thirty hospitals and thirty malaria prevention and treatment centres (Table 12).173 At FOCAC meetings, the use of artemisinin became an agenda where African leaders were informed of its efficacy. The Chinese gove rnment donated the Chinese made anti-malaria drugs after almost all FOCAC meetings. Indeed, compared to other diseases, malaria received a higher preference in the Chinese health develo pment assistance to Afri ca from the 2000s to 2013.174 I argue that China's anti-malaria campaign partly helped Africans to fight malaria. However, on the other hand, it promoted the use and superiority of Chinese-made anti-malaria therapies in Africa, which, in turn, enable d Chinese pharmaceutical companies to compete closely with the western-made anti-malaria therapies for the African market. China's anti-malaria campaign in Tanzania was officiated in 2006. On April 19, 2006, an MoU was signed between the Department of Aid to Foreign Countri es under the Ministry of Commerce of China and the National Mala ria Control Program (N MCP) under the MoH of Tanzania. The campaign aimed to introduce comprehensive Chinese experience in malaria control and set up a malaria cont rol demonstration centre. It intended to reduce malaria morbidity by responding to the local situation under the instruction from and experience of Chinese experts. The Chinese government pledged to assign experts on tropical diseases to exchange ideas with Tanzanian professionals to analyse the malarial situation and draft a feasible scheme on malaria prevention and cure in combination with the treating policy recommended by the WHO.175 171 Address by Hu Jintao, President of People's Republic of China at the Opening Ceremony of the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China Africa Cooperation, Beijing November 4, 2006 , 4. 172 Li, Chinese Medical Coop eration in Africa , 17. 173 Liu Jian, \"A Healthy Relationship: China-Africa Medical Cooperation still going strong after 50 years,\" (August, 2013): 15, also see, Li, Chinese Medical Cooperation in Africa , 13. 174 Mohon Shajalal, et al., \"China's Engagement with Developm ent Assistance for H ealth in Africa,\" Global Health Research and Policy 2, no. 24 (2017): 4. 175 \"Memorandum of understanding between Department of Aid to Foreign Countries, Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China and National Malaria Control Program, Ministry of Health and Social Welfare of 205 Table 12: Anti-malaria centres in Africa sponsored by China from 2007 to 2009 Country Date Location of the Centre/Hospital Name Liberia 1 February 2007 Monrovia Chad 28 December 2007 N'Djamena (N'Djamena Freedom Hospital) Senegal 2007 Dakar Burundi 17 March 2008 Bujumbura Uganda 15 May 2008 Kampala (Mulago Hospital) Congo Brazzaville 13 August 2008 Brazzaville Gabon 28 September 2008 Libreville (ChinaGabon Cooperation Hospital) Benin 10 November 2008 Lokosa GuineaBissau 10 December 2008 Bissau Ethiopia 26 December 2008 Aoluo Mo, Naz Togo 7 January 2009 Lom\u00e9 Mali 13 February 2009 Bamako (Kadi Hospital) Cameroon 26 March 2009 Yaound\u00e9 (Women's and Children's Hospital) Cote d'Ivoire 7 April 2009 Abidjan Rwanda 8 May 2009 Ki Gu Ki Jo Equatorial Guinea 7 June 2009 Bata Zambia 26 June 2009 Lusaka Comoros July 2009 Moheli Madagascar 6 October 2009 Tananarive (Infectious Disease Hospital) Sudan 14 October 2009 Ad Damazin Central African Rep. 25 October 2009 Bangui Ghana 28 October 2009 Accra Angola 23 October 2009 Luanda Guinea 6 November 2009 Conakry (Kona Correa Steen Hospital) Mozambique 25 November 2009 Maputo Sierra Leone 30 November 2009 Friston Hospital Tanzania 30 November 2009 Leah Amana Hospital Sources: Modified from Li Anshan Chinese Medical Cooperation in Africa , 14; Xia Zhi-Gui, et al., \"China-Africa Cooperation Initiatives in Malaria Control and Advances in Parasitology , 86 (2014): 334-335.

This claim is justified by the engagement of Chinese pharmaceutical company in the Sino-Tanzanian anti-malaria programme. The MoU consigned the Beijing Holle y-Cotec Pharmaceutical as the coordinator responsible for the management and implemen tation of the China-Tanzania anti-malaria programme.177 This context gave a chan ce to the company to coordi nate and boost the market for its anti-malaria drugs in Tanzania. For instance, in 2007, the company purchased shares from a Chinese provincial government which co-owned Tanzansino United Pharmaceuticals, a joint venture industry with the Tanzania n military. This firm produced and exported artemisinin-based combination therapies fo r malaria within and outside the country. 178 Although, since the 1960s, Chinese officials sang the song of self-reliance, findings of this study show that its a pproach to the anti-malaria cam paign hardly boos ted Tanzania's capacity to eliminate malaria sustainably. In co ntrast, the assistance prompted the country's dependency on Chinese-made anti-malarial ther apies. Instead of investing in preventive measures, the Chinese government preferred donating an ti-malaria drugs. For instance, in May 2006, the MoH of Tanzania was given a chance to choose efficacious artemisinin therapy made in China of which it was ready to donate.

Since official recognition of artemisinin by the WHO, donation of anti-malaria medicines to Africa became a priority to the Chin ese government. Anti-malaria drugs beca me an important gift of Chinese officials who visited Africa. For example, in his visit to Africa in 2002, President Jiang Zemin presented cotexcin to Nigeria as his gift to the Children's malaria project. Similarly, state visits to Africa by Chinese National Congress chair Wu Bangguo in 2004 and the visit by President Hu Jintao in 2006 donated anti-mal aria drugs made in China as their exceptional contribution to the fight against malaria.180 While such donations improved access to anti-malarial medicine for many patients, they also promoted Chinese drugs on African markets while falling short of the declared aim of promoting sustainable malaria control. It was regrettable that anti-malaria therapies made from artemisinin were mainly sourced from China. Archival information s uggests that such therapies could have been possibly produced in Tanzania. From the 1990s, Artemisia annua was commercially produced in Njombe, Arusha, Mara and Kagera Regions of Tanzania.181 Local production of anti-malaria raw materials was an imperative step toward producing anti-malaria therapies within the country. Nevertheless, the Tanzanian government and other stakeholders did not utilise the available raw materials to produce locally anti-malaria drugs. The extracted raw materials were shipped for overseas consumption. For example, in 2002, about 28 tons of artemisinin was destined for shipment overseas.182 Assistance from China and ot her countries of the North did not promise to utilise locally grown Artemisia annua for local production of anti-malaria therapies, nor did they priori tise preventive measures. Instead, they tied the government to foreign-made anti-malaria therapies through gran ts. Such attempt provided a short-time relief in the fight against malaria while worseni ng Tanzania's dependence on imported drugs. Cooperation on Malaria Control,\" NRC.

Its practi ce and acceptance added value to the strength of medical knowledge from the S outh. It further implied that th ere were potentials for South- South medical knowledge production and circulati on as an alternative to North-South. The current trend further suggests the possibility of South-North medical knowledge exchange. Global health players relied on biomedicine in the fight against pandemic diseases while excluding traditional medicines. TCM intervention in HIV/AIDS and malaria treatment was an attempt to promote innovation in and practice of medical know ledge from the South. Findings from the present study suggest that the Chinese-Tanzanian HIV/AIDS research was not particularly successful regarding eradicating th e disease and only marginally contributed to boosting the medical knowledge of local researchers and pract itioners. Nevertheless, TCM became widely practised and accepted in Tanzania . This did not come without self-interests, however, as Chinese engagement in African count ries yielded tangible benefits in terms of market access and scientific achievements. 209 CHAPTER FIVE \"TEACH A MAN HOW TO FISH , AND YOU FEED HIM FOR A LIFETIME\": THE ENTANGLEMENTS OF CHINESE-FUNDED PHARMACEUTICAL FACTORIES IN POST-COLONIAL TANZANIA 5.1 Introduction During the Cold War era, the Eastern and the Western blocs provided different forms of assistance to African countries depending on their respective prioriti es. For example, donors from the West gave priority to projects with immediate and tang ible results. In contrast, donors from the East gave prominence to long-term de velopment projects such as basic industries, scientific and educational f acilities, and health care.1 Assistance from both parties aimed to win allies in Africa. In post-colonial Tanzania, donors of the North, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, assist ed the government with medicines and funds to purchase drugs and medical equipment.2 By contrast, the Chin ese government provided grants and sponsored long-term projects which promised to trigger local production of pharmaceuticals. Its assistance was framed in the moral lesson from the ancient Chinese proverb, which goes: \" Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man how to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime .\" 3 The high costs of imported drugs and medi cal supplies were obstacles to improved health and wellbeing in Africa. Such challe nges burdened health care systems and limited effective health care delivery on the continen t. Local production of pharmaceuticals, by contrast, would maintain the c ountry's self-sufficiency, reduc e medical imports, and prevent the loss of foreign currency. This chapter surveys the emergence and development of Chinese-funded pharmaceutical industries in post-coloni al Tanzania, tracing their history and 1 Randall M.

It also discusses, in brief, the colonial attempt at establishing pharmaceutical factories in the territo ry, chronologically trac ing the evolution of pharmaceutical industries from the colonial to post-colonial periods. It further examines the extent to which Chinese sponsored pharmaceutical factories promoted self-sufficiency and how it implicated the Sino-Tanzanian pharmaceutic al knowledge exchange under the spirit of Southern solidarity. While pharmaceutical comp anies held great potential in view of Tanzania's self-reliance agenda, I argue that the Chin ese-sponsored factor ies rather created new forms of dependency in terms of the impor tation of raw materials and foreign technical experts. 5.2 Prelude to Post-Colonial Ph armaceutical Factories, 1902-1948 Industrialisation in the colonial territories was less encouraged in Africa since the colonies produced agricultural raw materials su ch as sisal, cotton, tea, and the like for the metropolitan industries. At the same time, colonialis ts turned the colonies into a market for the consumer and producer products of the colonial powers.4 Generally, the colonial economy was geared towards serving the interests of the colonial states and the metropolitan nations. Nevertheless, pharmaceutical manufacturing compan ies set up production faci lities and started manufacturing medicines in Africa already during the colonial pe riod. Investment in pharmaceuticals became visible in the 1930s, c oncentrating in Tanganyika, Kenya, South Africa, Zimbabwe and Nigeria. Throughout the co lonial period, investment in pharmaceutical industries was linked to multinational European co mpanies that set up subsidiaries in colonies. For instance, in 1930, Glaxo Company set up its base in Kenya. Like wise, in 1935, the Abbott companies established a pharmaceuti cal industrial base in South Af rica, while in Nigeria, May and Baker companies established their firms in 1944. 5 Pharmaceutical factories in some African countries were established and run by the colonial authorities. Tanganyika was a good example of such investments (see below). The establishment of pharmaceutical industries in some African countries went ha nd in hand with colonial econom ic investments. The colonial governments encouraged the establishment of pha rmaceutical industries in settler colonies to 4 URT, Report on the Fifty Years of Independence of Tanzania Mainland, 1961-2011 , 104; also read Chapter 5 in John Iliffe, A Modern History of Tanganyika (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1979). 5 Geoffrey Banda, Samuel Wangwe and Maureen Mackintosh, \"Making Medicines: An Historical Political Economy Overview,\" in Making Medicines in Africa: The Political Economy of Industrializing Local Health , ed. and Watu Wamae (London: Palgrave Macmillan, 2016), 8. 211 meet the demands of pharmaceuticals for settlers and labourers. Moreover, import challenges necessitated that the colonial authorities bui lt pharmaceutical industries during the world wars to meet the local supply of medici nes to military men and African troops.6 However, throughout most of the colonial period, ther e were few initiative s promoting the local production of medicines in Africa. The administra tions mostly sourced medicines from abroad, preferably from the respec tive colonial authorities' metropoles. The history of pharmaceutical industries in colonial Tanganyika dates back to the German colonial era. The Amani Tropical Agri cultural Research and Biological Institute, founded by Franz Ludwig Stuhlmann, and developed later into the East African Malaria and Vector-Borne Diseases Institute, eased the es tablishment of the industries. Moreover, the establishment of cinchona trees plantation at Bomole (Tanga) between 1902 and 1906 by the German colonialists gave a chance to the emer gence of a simple pharmaceutical factory in 1914. Cinchona trees were originally grown by indigenous communities in South America (Peru) and Java (Indonesia) under the Dutch. The seeds for cinchona trees grown in Tanganyika territory were imported from Java. The indigenous people of Peru initia lly employed the bark for the treatment of malaria. The bark was first utilised in European medicine in the early 17th century.7 The colonial chemists exploited the bark of cinchona to manufacture quinine sulphate used for anti-malaria in colonial Tanganyika. The fi rst alkaloid to be isolated from the bark in the pure state was quinine. The curative effect of the bark was due to the presence therein of several alkaloids, of which th e four main ones were quinine , cinchonidine, cinchonine, and quinidine. 8 In colonial Tanganyika, robusta . In sum, there were more than 75 acres of German-planted cinchona trees at 6 Amon J. Nsekela and Aloysius M.

German authorities ex tended several acres of cinchona tree farms to Kilosa-Morogoro.9 The German's initial goal of planting cinchona trees was not meant for its raw materials to be locally used for the producti on of quinine. Instead, it was grown to satisfy German needs for industrial raw materials and research by the Amani Institute. Germany's Imperial policy for the Tanganyika territory ga ve little priority to the establishment of pharmaceutical industries. Thus, its investment in the territory aimed to serve the interests of the metropolitan nations. 10 However, the advent of the First World War (1914 -1918) forced Germans to establish a simple pharmaceutical indu stry in the territory. During the War, local supplies of quinine were running short because of the insecurity that prevented the Germans from importing more quinine from abroad. Quinin e factories were opened in Kilosa and at the Veterinary Laboratory located at Mpapua (Ta nga). The factories exploited cinchona barks grown in Kilosa and at Amani Institute resp ectively. Production trials commenced on a small scale in January 1914, when about 10 kilos were produced a month by the officer in charge. The factories at Kilosa and Tanga continued to ope rate throughout the War (1914 -1918), producing quinine and other medicines. 11 The little remaining source material suggests that the German administration terminated their cinchon a farms by the end of the First World War. After the British takeover of the colony in 1918, the new colonial administration inherited the remains (ratoons) of the German cinchona trees. Tanganyika being a \"conquered\" territory, the League of Nations mandate was less valued for industrial investment by the British colonial government. In East Africa, Br itish colonial policy pr eferred to establish industries in Kenya, which was a settler colony.12 However, in the 1920s, the British government showed an interest in using cinc hona for manufacturing quinine in Tanganyika. To achieve this, it extended the plantations of cinchona trees in Tanga betw een 1922 and 23 by using the seeds they obtained from the existing trees. The British government anticipated that the manufacture of quinine in th e territory would cost less than the money it used to purchase 9 \"Report on Alkaloid Content of Amani Cinchona Trees, 1931,\" TNA.

Thus, in the early 1930s, the colonial administration opened more farms for cinchona and encouraged peasants' plantations. To trigger further production, the co lonial authorities sanctioned a grant from the Colonial Development Fund to plant 100 acres of cinchona at the Amani Station. The plans by the British colonial government were to reach 1,200 acres re quired to feed a large-scale quinine factory.14 The League of Nations Malaria Commi ssion further advocated the production of cinchona trees in colonial Tanganyika. The commission endorsed the production of cinchona in the malarial tropical countries where the cost of imported drugs prohibited their use.15 During the 1930s, the malaria rate in Tanga nyika amounted to 228 patients per 1,000 population. On the population figure of 5,022,640, the number requiring treatment became 1,145,162. The quantity of quinine thus required was estimat ed to be about 78,525 1b. (1,145,162 x 480 grains), equivalent to 35 tons per year.16 Indeed, the demand for quinine was higher and would cost the colonial government dearly if it committed itself to providing malarial treatment to all patients exclusively via imported quinine. However, the director of medical services in the territory declared that the amount required for African prophylaxis in Tanganyika would be much less than actual demand. His assertions were root ed in the fact that quinine salts would only be exhibited for the specific purpose of protecting a small aggregation of people such as labour units, or others fo r whom the benefit to be derived from the expenditure had positive economic si gnificance to the British Crown.17 Thus, despite malarial contexts in Tanganyika, the pr oduction of cinchona was meant to only save a few categories of people with economic importance to the co lonial government. Chiefly, the promotion of cinchona production was aimed at supplying qui nine factories established in Europe. Despite the successful extension of cinchona plantations in Tanganyika, the colonial government did not establish a quinine factor y throughout the 1920s and early 1930s.

Totaquina consisted of a mixture of qui nine, cinchonine and cinc honidine, with a trace of quinidine, and about 15% to 20% of amorpho us alkaloids, together with a limited amount of inorganic matter and moisture. Its test showed that it was e qual to quinine in therapeutic value. Totaquina was capable of destroying malarial parasites of all forms except the gametocytes of subtertian and schizonts. 18 The plans for the totaquina factory recei ved significant consideration after 1936. However, it took until 1941 for the British govern ment to allocate funds for the factory. Bark from the old half-forgotten plantation and the cinchona just reaching maturity planted in different parts of the territory enabled the tota quina factory to commence at Dar es Salaam in 1942.19 The British needed to establish the f actory during the Second World War period because Java, which was the leading supplier of quinine to the British colonies, had been occupied by the Japanese in February 1942. This deprived the British and its allies of the primary source of global quinine supply.20 To alleviate the situation, the British government encouraged the production of dr ugs locally in the colonies. Hence, Tanganyika's existing cinchona plantations gained favour with the British. The production rate of totaquina at the Dar es Salaam factory, which rose from 640 1bs. in 1942 to 8,900 1bs. in 1945, was promising. Co lonial officials led the factory, yet a few Africans were employed to work in a lower cadre such as foreman and other assistants (Figure 17). Many Africans did not qualify for jobs that re quired more expertise as the colonial system denied their access to formal education.21 However, the colonial o fficials promoted to higher- ranking jobs such as tablet making a few African s who showed higher ability. For instance, in 1944, the factory hired one African to work as a tablet maker afte r he had served for two and a half years as an assistant to a British expert.22 Generally, many Africans worked in the lower 18 \"A Memorandum on Cinchona Development and Research on Totaquina, 1944,\" TNA.

Notwithstanding the good quality of totaquina pr oduced in Dar es Salaam, the British colonial government ceased its production in October 1947, followed by two years of decline after the end of WW II. The cessation implies that the operation of the factory was wartime expedient. It was, instead, a simple short- term factory since long- term and sophisticated factories were inconsistent with the imperial policy. 23 After the cessation of production, the coloni al government proposed to dispose of the factory to the Associat ion of Cinchona Growers (peasants) w ho previously supplied the factory with bark. However, by the time the agreements were reached, the association had ceased to 23 \"Letter from the Member for Finance, Trade and Eco nomics, December 18, 1948 to the Director of Medical Services,\" TNA.

An elected committee of representatives of the cinchona es tates concerned proposed the formation of a syndicate comprising three lead ing growers in Tanganyika who had for several years produced over 75% of the total cinchona bark grown in th e territory, to whom the factory was to be handed over.24 However, information concerning the pr ogress of the factor y after it had been handed over to the syndicate disappears from the colonial files in Tanzania archives. The preceding assertions show that both Ge rmans and the British colonialists did not prioritise the establishment of pharmaceutic al industries in Tanga nyika territory. The emergence of pharmaceutical factories duri ng the WW I and II aimed at addressing the challenges of the availability and supply of dr ugs temporarily during the war periods, as seen in the rapid closure of the industries shortly after the end of the Wars. Moreover, encouragement of the production of cinchona trees by both Germans and the British colonialists aimed to ensure constantly th e supply of raw materials to European based pharmaceutical industries. Despite all that, colo nial pharmaceutical industries constituted a founding stone for their development in the post- colonial period. The establishment of several hectares of cinchona plantations was an im portant foundation. Post-colonial Tanganyika had an opportunity to take over from where the Br itish colonialists ended by establishing not only plantations for quinine raw materi als but also investing in othe r sources of raw materials for the sustainable development of its post-colonial pharmaceutical industries. However, discussions in the subsequent sections show that the post-colonial government abandoned the colonialists ' cinchona farms in favour of impor ted pharmaceutical raw materials. 5.3 Health Challenges and Post-Independence Government Interventions for Pharmaceuticals Tanzania's health care situation at indepe ndence was terrifying. A health care report covering the period from 1961 to 62 shows that life expectancy was 35 years for men and 40 years for women. The death ra te was 47 out of 1,000 pregnant women who gave birth. Furthermore, infant and child mortality rate was 40% to 50% before children reached the age 24 \"S. M. P. 27509, Memorandum No. 3 for Executive Counc il, Totaquina Factory, January 6, 1949,\" TNA.

Indeed, successful preventive measures required the spread of sufficient preventive health education to the population as well as vaccination ag ainst diseases such as tuberc ulosis and smallpox. Yet, the government depended on the acquisition of all of its vaccination therapies from overseas. Similarly, curative measures could not attain ta ngible achievements wit hout an adequate supply of medicines and medical equipment. The post-colonial government attempted various ways to provide policy guidelines by which it would disengage itself from such neo- colonial economic entanglement and thereby hasten its progress to achieve self-reliance. It realised that the importation of medicines from abroad was the main cause of the scarcity of foreign currency. This, in turn, placed a heavy brake on the speed of development. 28 Thus, in its First Five Y ear Development Plan (FYDP) covering the period 1964 -69, the Ministry of Commerce and Industries pledged to convert Tanzania from an agrarian and weak country, dependent upon the caprices of other countries, into an industrial and powerful country, full y self-reliant, and inde pendent of exploiting countries.29 To achieve this objective, the ministry, in its development plans, laid a firm industrial base. 25 URT.

These industries were founded at the moment when the government place d priority on expanding health care to serve basic needs, raise life expectancy, and foster healthy co mmunities. On the other hand, the government's stress on pharmaceutical industries aimed at remedying the state of the country's dependency on imported drugs which became expensive and unsustainable to manage for a growing economy. 30 Indeed, the establishment of pharmaceutical factories presented an opportunity to save lives while creating jobs and improving the local economy. The industries anticipated and prompted local production of packing material s, containers, boxes, printing work, medical literature, and other products demanded by the factories. Above all, these production jobs would also increase the country's export volume, creating industries that would ensure constant production for domestic needs and surplus fo r export projected to boost the country's economy.31 This indicates that pharmaceutical industries were vital for the nation's development and at improving the standard of peoples' health, which assure d a vigorous labour force for the development of a sound economy.32 Concrete steps to implement the govern ment's plans to set up pharmaceutical industries were envisaged in the Second Five Year Development Plan (SFYDP) projected for 1969 -74. The government envisioned establishing three government-owned pharmaceutical factories.33 Such commitment was bound by the government statement which outlined its intent to practise the national polit ics of self-reliance through loca l production of pharmaceuticals.34 Therefore, Mabibo Vaccine Institute and Keko Pharmaceutical Industries (discussed below) were established under the country's scheduled development agenda. These two factories supplemented the existing privately owned Ma nsoor Daya Industries, founded in 1962 (see below). 30 \"Proposal for the Setting up of a F actory to produce Pharmaceutical Products in Tanzania, 1964,\" TNA.

Through its Three-Year Development Plan (TYDP) of 1961 -64, the government created favourable conditions for foreign capital by offering tariff pr otection and tax incentives. For instance, the Foreign Investment Act of 1963, among other comm itments, gave immunity to the foreign capital from nationalisation without compen sation. Furthermore, in January 1965, the government established the National Developmen t Cooperation (NDC), wh ich was responsible for the promotion of both private and publi c investments in the industrial sector.35 Subsequently, both Tanzanians and foreigners sh owed interest in investing in pharmaceutical industries. For instance, Mansoor Daya, a pharm acist who engaged in a retail pharmacy in Dar es Salaam since 1959, collaborated with the Tayf ord Laboratories of Engl and to establish the Mansoor Daya Chemicals Limited in 1962. The indus try, which was the first to be establised in post-colonial Tanzania, st arted its production in May 1965.36 Though it was a small-scale unit, with the establishment cost of Ts hs. 1,500,000, its inauguration was an important milestone in the fight against diseases and fo r the local production of pharmaceuticals. The unit manufactured drugs for both pr eventive and curative measures targeting the demands and consistent with the existing health challenges.37 Nevertheless, production at Mansoor Daya Chemicals Limited was not enough to satisfy the needs of the whol e country. Hence, the government signed an agreement with investors from Israel, Tegry-Assia Pharmaceutical Factory, to establish another factory in Dar es Salaam. The plant was to be co-owned by the NDC.38 However, the investors and the 35 URT, Ministry of Industries Mineral Resources and Powe r, Budget Speech.

The investors wanted the Tanzanian government to commit itself to purchasing the produced medicines per prices fixed by the industry, which the Tanzanian government did not accept. As the two parties failed to meet consensus, th e board of NDC cancelled its certificate on April 5, 1968. 39 Chinese-funded pharmaceutical industries in Tanzania were estab lished shortly after the government had endorsed the Arusha Declarat ion in 1967, which defined a socialist course of development. Under the declaration, th e state controlled the economy to overcome dependence over private parastatals. Thus, it nati onalised privately owned industries to enable the government to own basic means of production (Chapter 2). Such polic ies discouraged local and foreign investment in pharmaceutical industries.40 Consequently, pharmaceutical industries funded by the Chinese government were compatible with the government's endeavour to have state-owned en terprises. In Af rica, Tanzania was the fi rst to get assisted by the Chinese government where two industries, Mabibo Vaccine Inst itute (MVI) and Keko Pharmaceutical Industries (KPI), were bui lt in 1968 (discussed below). Algeria followed Tanzania in line to receive Chinese assist ance, and on December 22, 1976, consented with China to construct a factory for surgical instruments in Middiyyah.41 China's commitment to technical and econom ic assistance to Tanzania in the 1960s astounded Nyerere who still pe rceived China as a technol ogically and economically low- income country. He openly confessed: \"It did no t occur to us that th e great, but poor, Third World country of China, would be able to help, even if it wa s willing to do so.

Yet, Hua Hsin discloses that up to the mid-1960s, the Chines e government had attained a healthy economic and technological development. After the 1949 liberation movement , China embarked vigorously on the establishment of industries for hospital equipment. The industries enabled the government to have enough Chinese-made equi pment that was used to diagnose and treat diseases as well as facilitate surgical ope rations. Such investments transformed China's dependency on imported hospital equipment. By the 1970s, it imported only 1,500 types of medical equipment in 5,000 specifi cations to meet its domestic needs. The Chinese government further established resear ch institutes of medical equipment and built big factories in Beijing, Tianjin and Shanghai, and in th e provinces of Shaanxi and Sic huan to produce enough medical equipment to cater to the needs of the whole China.43 These examples imply that the moment China pledged to assist Tanzania in terms of equipment and experts for the pharmaceutical industries, it had already made a step in producing them at home. 5.4 Mabibo Vaccine Institute (MVI), 1968-1984 The most effective way to prevent many infectious diseases is through vaccination, but for now, all inoculated medicines are imported from abroad. With the help of a friendly country [China], [Tanzania] seeks to establish a vaccine factory to manufactur e locally two kinds of vaccine drugs before the end of 1969.44 The preceding quotation underscores the government's commitment to establishing a vaccine plant to conform with its self-reliance agenda and the preventive health care campaign endorsed in TYDP for 1961 -64 and FYDP for 1964 -69. The campaign stressed the dual approaches of hygiene and vaccina tion to address diseases such as tuberculosis and smallpox.45 Undoubtedly, the establishment of a vaccine factor y challenged the colonial health policies, which gave less prominence to preventive measur es. During the colonial era, both Germans and the British established simple vaccine factories in Tanganyika. The smallpox lymph vaccine was produced in Dar es Salaam by Germans until they fl ed the territory during the WW 43 Hua Hsin, \"Chinese Factory's Long March from Dustpans to Hospital Equipment,\" Daily News , October 19, 1977, 4. 44 My translation from Kiswahili in JMT, Mpango also see URT, Second Five-Year Plan for Economic and Social Development Ju ly 1, 1969-June 30, 1974, Volu me I: General Analysis, 1969 , 173. 45 URT, Tanganyika, Development Plan for Tangan yika, 1961/62-1963/6 4, , 1962 , 18; URT, Tanganyika, Five-Year Plan for Economic and Social Development, July 1, 1964-June 30, 1969, Volume II: The Programmes, 1964 , 118. 222 I. In 1926, the British colonial government took over the production of a vaccine for smallpox at the Veterinary Research Laboratory in Mpwapwa-Dodoma. The production of vaccines by the British stopped at the outbreak of WW II in 1939. Therefore, from WW II to independence, vaccines were sourced from Nairobi, where th ey built a large and sophisticated vaccine factory.46 Importing vaccines from Nairobi led to an unavoidable delay, and sometimes vaccines were spoiled while on the way to Ta nganyika. Compatibly, its distribution to the interior was challenging because of the unf avourable transport system. These hurdles discouraged the extension of i noculation services to the inte rior of Tanganyika territory.47 Consequently, China's assistance in the restit ution of the vaccine factory was not only an imperative attempt in challenging the colonial policies but also emancipation from dependence on imported vaccines from countries of the North. The Mabibo plant was co-financed by the Tanzanian and the Chinese governments. Tanzania received China's support in the form of \"Technical Assistance\", whereby the Chinese government covered expenses related to experts for technical work and all equipment needed for production and construction work. In return, the Tanzanian government provided funds for the erection of the plant buildings, worth Tshs. 1,000,000. 48 The plant was located at Mabibo, a few miles outside the city centre of Dar es Salaam in the Kigogo area. President Julius K. Nyerere officially inaugura ted the plant on April 23, 1971.49 About 70 Tanzanians manned the factory under the supervision of Chinese experts who taught them the art of vaccine manufacturing (Figure 18). Production commen ced in January 1971, and the first production was issued to Kisarawe District in Marc h 1971 for TB prevention. Up to 1972, about 500 people were vaccinated at Kisarawe District.50 Regrettably, some industrial equipment sourced from China was found unsuitable in hot climate re gions such as Dar es Salaam. The hot weather lowered the quality of the liquid produced vaccine. As a result, in 1974, the plant changed its products from a liquid form into tablets and pr ocured new equipment for drying the liquid made 46 Nsekela and Nhonoli, The Development of Health Services , 9. 47 \"Letter from Senior Medical Officer , Western and Central Province, Tabora, December 24, 1949 to the Director of Medical Services, Small Vaccine Ly mph,\" TNA.

The MV I produced not only enough vaccines to satisfy the needs of the country but also a surplus whic h was sold to nearby countries. Its production capacity was 1.5 million doses of freeze-dried vaccine for smallpox and 250,000 doses of Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccine for TB per year.51 Figure 18: Chinese and local workers standi ng by a newly imported vaccine dryer, 13. Local production of vaccines rekindled hope that it would be possible for the government to combat TB and smallpox succe ssfully. Prior to its establishment, the government relied on imported vaccines and gr ants. For example, from 1968 to 71, the United Nations International Children's Emergency F und (UNICEF) and the WHO provided vaccines, transport facilities, vaccine k its, and medical equipment to support smallpox and tuberculosis eradication campaigns.52 Yet, the granted vaccines did not cover the needs of the country. As a result, throughout the 1960s, the government spent more than Tshs. 2,000,000 each year for purchasing vaccines from abroad. 53 Indeed, reliance on grants and imported vaccines was 51 \"A Special Report, Chinese Medical Assistance to Tan zania, May 12, 1972,\" TNA.

Accordingly, local vaccine production anticipated preserving foreign currency and triggeri ng the country's medical self- reliance. The MVI began with the production of BC G for TB, followed by the freeze-dried vaccine for smallpox. The government dearly need ed these two vaccines to curb smallpox and TB, which were spreading at an alarming rate (see below). The incidences of smallpox and TB were not only a threat to the Tanzanian popul ation but to many countries of the South. For instance, in 1958, the World Health Assembly endorsed the Smallpox Eradication Programme (SEP) to fight the epidemic. With the frighten ing rate of its sprea d, the WHO gave much attention to SEP from 1966.54 The production of vaccines at MV I was, therefore, responding to the global health challenges. Back in Ta nzania, incidences rose during the WW II and accelerated further after independence. The WW II military requirements caused a considerable dislocation of the rural epidem iological services, which, allowe d smallpox cases to increase markedly in many parts of the c ountry, particularly south and east of Lake Victoria (Table 13). Yet, it took until 1968 for the Tanzanian gove rnment to launch a robust campaign against smallpox and ensure that all newborns were inoculated. 55 The government's regulation was obligatory given the mounting incidences of smallpox. The 1965 annual re port of the Health Division shows the incidences of smallpox more than doubling from 1,461 cases in 1964 to 3,017 cases in 1966 (Table 13). Such a rise occu rred despite the vaccination campaign, which was underway. In 1964, for instance, the govern ment inoculated about 1,500,000 people. The number of inoculated Tanzanians rose to 3,131,555 out of more than 11,000,000 people by 1965. 54 Packard, A History of Global Health, 129-145. 55 URT, Ministry of Health, Annual Report of the Health Division 1965 Volume I, 6; W. l.

Yet, the 1965 report shows that smallpox ep idemics affected dearly several regions such as Mwanza, which reported 490 cases , Mbeya 475, Kigoma 407, Shinyanga 354, and 226 Iringa, which recorded 309 cases. Other regions such as Tabora, Singida , and Mtwara reported not more than 100 cases while the inciden ces in other regions were less sporadic.56 This increasing smallpox epidemic in the mid-1960s incited the importation of vaccines and made the need for the local producti on of vaccines an appealing. Furthermore, TB was also a serious th reat to the Tanzania government. The 1967 annual report of the Health Divisi on shows that TB incidences we re rampant in all regions of Tanzania. Numerous TB cases among both outpa tients and inpatients were Regions (Table 14).57 Table 14: Tuberculosis incidences by 1967 Region Population Total No. T.B. Beds Total No. B.C.G.

Nevertheless, in 1979, the WHO declared the eradication of sm allpox, and subsequently, the MVI condensed the production of the freeze-dried vaccine. At the same time, 50 employees from a total of 70 left the plant. The production of BCG vaccine co ntinued, but after the Chinese experts left, the quality of the vaccines produced by local workers no longer met the WHO requirements. It was in such a context that the production of BC G vaccine halted in 1982, and a few remaining personnel, left unoccupied, abandoned the factory.58 In 1980, Mabibo was handed over to the National Chemical Industries (NCI) through the Ministry of Industries with a view of rehabilitation. In 1984 it was considered as th e most suitable site for housing the Extended Program of Immunisation (EPI) in Tanzania. As a result, all but three of the buildings were handed over to the Ministry of Health for the use of EPI. In July 1986 the remaining three buildings were handed over by NCI for the use of EPI. Thus, Mabibo has not been available for vaccine production ever since.59 5.5 Keko Pharmaceutical Industries (KPI) and the Production for Self-Sufficiency 1968-1997 The Keko plant was established in 1968 as a unit under the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare. It was a medium-scale unit w ith facilities for the production of tablets, capsules, and infusions for curative purposes. Its foundation stone was laid in 1973 by the first Vice President Aboud Jumbe. The construction of KPI was divided into two phases. Phase one was completed in 1972, while the second phase was done in July 1975. Trial production started immediately after the completion of civi l works and installation of machinery.60 KPI was built under the assistance of the Chinese government fo llowing the request by Tanzania's Ministry of Health in 1967. The plant was built at the cost of Tshs. 9.9 million, the government of Tanzania contributing a sum of Tshs. 5.1 million for civil works and the remaining Tshs. 4.8 million, which was in the form of machinery, raw materials and technology, were provided by 58 United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), Programme for Production of Vaccines in Africa, Technical Report: Programme for Production of Vaccines in Tanzania, Prepared for the Government of the United Republic of Tanzania, on January 6, 1986 , 5. 59 UNIDO, Establishment of a Formulation-Filling Plant for Bacterial Vaccines for Veterinary Application Technical Report, Findings and Recommendations, Prepared for the Government of the United Republic of Tanzania, on November 13, 1991 , 9. 60 \"A Special Report, Chinese Medical Assistance to Tanz ania, May 12, 1972,\" TNA.

However, in May 1980, the plant was tran sferred to the Minist ry of Industries under the newly established parastatal, the NCI. As a parastatal, KPI began to produce on a commercial basis rather than a non-profit making unit.61 From its commencement, KPI vowed to maintain the government's policy of socialism and self-reliance by substituting impor ts of pharmaceuticals with local production. The factory had a production capacity of 105 million tablets, twelve categories of injections contained in 10 million ampules, and five categor ies of intravenous infusions contained in 40,000 vials per year. At its early stage, the pl ant committed to produci ng highly needed drugs consistent with the existing he alth challenges. Its trial pr oduction list included about 35 varieties of medicines.62 However, in 1977, production wa s reduced to 25 products. The management realised that th ere was little demand for some products, while others were uneconomical. For instance, eye drops were in less demand due to fewer eye cases. The production of some drugs was phased out, as th ey were perceived to be unpopular with many users. Among the 25 listed products, not al l were routinely produc ed. Some drugs were produced only on special requests.63 There was an increase in production for the seriously needed medicines at the plant. The available figures show that aspirin and dextrose were in high demand. Thus, production of these drugs ro se tremendously. For instance, the production of aspirin rose from 20 million tablets in 1975 to 35 million in 1977. Similarly, the production 61 \"National Chemical Industries, Brie f Notes on Keko Pharmaceutical Industri es Limited, 1981,\" TNA. Acc.

The Chinese pharmaceutical technicians handed over the plant to Tanzanians in June 1976. Regrettably, shortly after the handover, th e production trend began to contract. The financial statistics of 1977 show that the plant did not make any profit, but rather lost Tshs. 90,673.83. The factors that led to this loss included an inadequate supply of raw materials, poor management, and the lack of enough skilled personnel.65 Such shortfalls reveal that the conditions for a successful handover have not been satisfied. The production trends show that the target of production was not realised through out the period when the plant was under close eyes of the Chinese government (Table 15). It wa s not until 1981 that tablet production reached 130 million, and in 1983 when the production of infusion turned 125,000 litres. The production target at KPI was realised and exceeded its initial capacity at a period when the government turned to the loans and grants from Nordic c ountries and others of the North. Donor countries from the North provided loans and grants to purchase raw materials and modern equipment which replaced Chinese producti on technology (see below). The ne w machines re-installed in the plant were mostly sourced from England and Germany.66 This increase in production in the 1980s implies that the availability of enough raw materials and modern machines were imperative for the efficiency and sustainabl e development of phar maceutical industries. Nevertheless, from the early 1990s, donors from Nordic countries and others from the North reduced their loans and grants to the Tanzanian government, which, in turn, led to a severe decline in the production of pharmaceuti cals. The government lacked enough foreign currency to purchase raw materials for these industries.67 Reductions in loans and grants were prompted by liberal politics, which promoted a free-market economy and privatisation of government enterprises. Such pol icies in favour of privatisation and private corporations discouraged financial and material support to go vernment-owned factories.

Its production dropped to 602 million tablets in 1990. The only advantage of th e time was that while government-owned pharmaceutical industries registered little succe ss, privately owned industries supplied the market requirements to a more considerable degree. For instance, the Mansoor Daya and Shellys Ltd. pharmaceutical industries increas ed their production of tablets from 35,535 million tablets in 1989 to about 47,596.7 million tablets in 1990.70 Production trends at government pharm aceutical factories continued to drop extremely. The production of tablets fell to about 12%, from 463 million tablets in 1991 to 407.2 million tablets in 1992.71 The situation was worse in 1993, when the production of the two government-owned pharmaceutical industries dropped at 51%; that is, from 407.2 million tablets in 1992 to 198 million tablets in 1993. Thes e drops imply that the assistance which the Tanzanian government received from the Nordic and other donor countries in the 1980s did not sustainably enhance the operational capaciti es of pharmaceutical indu stries. Moreover, the promising performance of the privately-owned ph armaceutical industries justified the need for privatisation of government-owned pharmaceutic al industries. As a result, in 1997, the government sold off Keko to a private investor who owned 60% of shares with the remaining 40% retained by the government. However, since then, Keko has come under the administration and management of a private investor.72 As the Tanzania n government had thus failed to deve lop an integrated and coordinated policy, local pharmaceutical industries faile d to produce enough pharmaceuticals to meet demand and foster self-dependency. As a re sult, local pharmaceutical industries contributed marginally to the country's medical self-relianc e aspirations. For example, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, local production never accounted for more than 5-7% of the country's total 68 Interview by Andrea Kifyasi with Cleopa David Msuya, July 6, 2018, Upanga, Dar es Salaam. 69 Tanzania Pharmaceutical In dustries Ltd (TPI) was the third government-owned phar maceutical industry after MVI and KPI.

The failure of KPI and other domestic phar maceutical industries to meet national demands made the government spend most of its foreign currency on purchasing drugs and other medical equipment from abroad. Available financial information discloses that the total costs of imported medicinal and pharmaceutical pr oducts rose with time. For instance, the costs surged from USD 0.9 million in 1964 to USD 4 m illion in 1968. Then costs swelled again from Tshs. 34 million in 1971 to Tshs. 120 million in 1977. 74 Inevitably, the mounting costs for 73 Economic Commission for Africa, Chemical Industry Development Programme , 107; \"World Drug Market Manual, 1982,\" TNA.

Yet, the government a fforded only 35% of it ; relying for the rest on loans and grants from multilateral lenders and donor countries.75 In 1990, the government predicted that the costs for the purchase of medicines and medical equipment would shoot to at least Tshs. 8 billion by 2000. However, the actual cost turned out to be Tshs. 10 billion, Tshs. 2 billion higher than the government's forecasts. Worse st ill, the costs further increased to Tshs. 30 billion in 2004/2005 and to Tshs. 53 billion in 2008/2009, respectively.76 5.6 The Raw Materials for Pharmaceutical Industries As seen in the previous section discussing the British colonial government's efforts to plant cinchona trees, access to raw materials was at the heart of the industry. As in other industrial undertakings, a co nstant supply of raw materi als was imperative for the pharmaceutical industry. Yet, investment in the production of pharmaceutical raw materials was not taken seriously by many African countries at independen ce. As a result, the production of pharmaceuticals in the continent leaned toward s the secondary and tertiary levels, meaning that the industries produced finished dosage fo rms from imported raw materials and excipients (inactive substances) as well as packag ing and labelling finished products.77 With limited exceptions for South Africa, Egypt, and Ghana, production at the primary level, which involved manufacturing active pharmaceutical i ngredients (APIs) and intermediates78 from basic chemical and biological substances, did not exis t. Up to 2012, 95% of APIs were imported to Africa.79 Thus, many post-colonial African industr ies produced generic medicines, which means the copies of original or innovating branded medicines.

The medicines produced contained the same form of dosage, therapeutic effect, delivery route, known risks, and side effect s as the originator drug.80 This situation limited the development of pharmaceutical knowledge and innovations to many African countries. It further aggravated the dependency on foreign brands and prompt ed repatriation of the economy through the purchase of APIs. While the first pharmaceutical industry es tablished in the country (Mansoor Daya Chemicals Ltd.) utilised raw materials from overseas and mainly from England, the first Chinese-funded vaccine plant (Mabibo Vaccine Institute) de pended on China for its raw materials.81 The Chinese themselves did not produce all vaccine-related raw materials during that time. Instead, a few of them were bought from Holland and exported to Tanzania based on the factory's demand. Imported raw materials fo r the vaccine factory were specifically for manufacturing TB vaccines while the production of vaccines for smallpox utilised locally produced raw materials.82 The availability of raw materials for the Keko plant was also problematic. KPI began its production by using a stock of raw material s provided by the Chin ese government as a grant.83 While this grant facilitated the launch of the production, it also constituted a market entry strategy for Chinese pharmaceutical raw mate rials in Tanzania. It is evident that KPI utilised raw materials it received from China for a while and promptly began purchasing such raw materials largely in China.84 80 Banda, Wangwe and Mackintosh, \"Making Medicines,\" 11; also see J.

Some pharmaceutical raw materials for KP I were purchased in other countries including India, Britain, Sw itzerland, and the Netherlands , since, by the 1970s, Chinese enterprises did not produce every kind of raw materials needed.85 Anecdotal evidence shows that the Chinese government was privileged fo r imports by its aid recipient countries. For instance, in Zanzibar, a government official assured the Deputy Ambassador of China to Tanzania saying that: \"Often when we want to or der [products] we first ask China and if they 85 \"Ripoti ya Quality Control, 1976/77,\" TNA.

Such privileges were inconsistent with China's \"Eight Principles\" of economic cooperation and foreign aid, whereb y in its second prin ciple, the Chinese go vernment promised to honour the sovereignty of the recipient countries while providing aid with no strings attached or asking for any privileges.87 Indeed, in the 1970s, it was diplomatically difficult for the Tanzanian government to import raw materials for MVI and KPI from Europe, America, or elsewhere so long as Chinese firms produced sim ilar kinds of raw materials. Such an attempt would have deterred the bilateral relationshi p between the two countries. Consequently, the execution of China's assistance in pharmaceutical industries created a market for Chinese raw materials. A grant of raw materials offered by the Chinese government immediately after the handover of MVI and KPI persuaded the manage ments to place the orders for their raw materials with China. Thus, by 1977, China dominated the supply of pharmaceutical raw materials to KPI, as shown in Table 16. From the above table, it is apparent that KP I imported more than 60% of raw materials from China and purchased a few in India, Holland, London, and Geneva. Yet, the 1977 report from the department of quality control shows th at the plant utilised a few varieties of raw materials such as laboratory chemicals which were locally produced.88 Unfortunately, I could not get more information detailing the quant ity and quality of the produced chemicals. Moreover, information showing the progress of the production of the chemicals mentioned above could not be found. As there were no implemented plan s for the local production of pharmaceutical raw materials, local producti on continuously depended on overseas imports. Findings of this study show that the n ecessary purchase of pharmaceutical raw materials made the government spend consider ably large sums of foreign currency not allocated in its budget. Investment in pharm aceutical industries re duced the government's spending on imported medicines from abroad but increased demands for foreign currency used to purchase pharmaceutical raw materials.

For instance, the costs for pharmaceutical raw materials at KPI rose from Tshs. 19 million in 1981 to Tshs. 24.7 million in 1982. Furthermore, they increased from Tshs. 30.13 million in 1983 to Tshs. 37.66 million in 1984. On the other hand, the grant for raw materials that the KPI received from Nordic countries in 1984 lowere d the costs of importing raw materials from Tshs. 37.66 million in 1984 to Tshs. 20.05 million in 1985. 89 This implies that the local production of raw materials for pharmaceutical indus tries was essential in saving costs related to higher demands of foreign currency. Dependence on imported raw materials for ph armaceutical industries was challenging. In addition to the costs incurred, and as raw ma terials were transported by a ship, it took a minimum of three months to receive the goods in the Dar es Salaam port. Procurement processes were usually bureaucratic, which further discouraged purchases and delayed importation.90 Moreover, imported raw materials raised production costs, which led to higher prices for Tanzanian-made drugs. Yet, fewe r initiatives were made by the Tanzanian government to encounter import-dependence to its local industries. In his address to the national conference of the ruling political pa rty Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM), Chairman Julius. K. Nyerere confessed: \"We have paid little attention to the possibility of the local development of these minor but e ssential inputs [industr ial raw materials] [. . . .] The problem of the import-dependence of our industries ha s never been given sufficient weight in our decisions [. . . .]\" 91 Disappointments of Mwalimu Nyerere prompted the Mi nistry of Industries and Commerce to develop a plan to tackle the quest ion of obtaining raw mate rials. Subsequently, in its Third Five Year Development Plan, the ministry proposed to in crease the production of pharmaceutical industries to reach at least 40% of the actual needs of medicines in the country using locally produced raw materials and vowed to reduce the importation of pharmaceutical raw materials and promote local production. Yet, the ministry planned to consent to the 89 \"Brief Notes on Keko Pharmaceutical Industries Limited, 1981,\" TNA. Acc.

Nyerere, on October 20, 1982 at Diamond Jubilee Hall, Dar es Salaam , 44. 237 importation of a few varieties of raw material s which could not possibly be produced in Tanzania. With such projections, the government anticipated producing locally more than 80% of the demand for medicines by 1986.92 Unfortunately, such dreams did not materialise. The importation status after 1986 remained similar to the previous years, with the government importing more than 90% of medicines and all of its raw materials for chemical industries. Undeniably, the question of raw materials pos ed a great challenge to the development of pharmaceutical industries. Some scholars argue that the production of pharmaceutical raw materials in Africa - and Tanzania, in particular - was impossible. For instance, J. V. S Jones maintains that the production of commonly used drugs in Tanzania such as aspirin and chloroquine demanded a large bank of intermediate chemicals such as sulphuric acid, caustic soda, and chlorine. It also needed reagents such as acetic acid, acet ic anhydride, benzene, ethylene, alcohol, and others, the production cost of which a non-industrialised and a low- income country like Tanzania could not afford. He added that the country further lacked a strong quality control team to guarantee a high standard of purity for the chemicals. 93 Despite the merits of Jones' observations, I argue that Tanzania had the potential to produce some pharmaceuticals using locally produced raw mate rials while importing a few which could not be produced in the country. For instance, the production of quini ne could have been eased by the presence of cinchona planta tions established during German and British colonial periods. Suleiman Mbonea Mlungwana, a long-time employee at KPI, admitted that local production of some raw materials was possible, but the goodwill of political elites and donors was missing. 94 The possibilities of producing raw material s locally would have been learnt from Congo (DRC), where a Belgian-established pharmaceutical factory, Regie Congokina (now Pharmakina), produced quinine using cinchona ba rks yielded at Kivu and Ituri provinces. The factory commenced the manufacturing of quinine using the locally grown cinchona barks from 1944 to the present.95 Mzee Mlungwana contended that the Ph armakina fed KPI quinine 92 URT, Hotuba ya 93 Jones, Resources and Industry in Tanzania, 97. 94 Interview by Andrea Kifyasi with Suleiman Mbone a Mlungwana, June 6, 2018, KPI Headquarters, Mzee Mlungwana is a Quality Assurance Manager at KPI.

Information from the MoH shows that up to 1985 cinchona was grown in Tanga Region, especially at Amani in Lushoto a nd Handeni Districts. For instance, there was a large-scale production of cinc hona in Dindira, which had 9 40 acres and produced 36 tons each year. Similarly, Balangai cinchona farm w ith 700 acres produced 62 tons each year. At the same time, in Moga where 24 acres of cinchona was planted produced at least 756 kilograms of cinchona bark annually.97 Nevertheless, the cinchona bark produced in the post- colonial period was not locally utilised. Instea d, the bark was exported overseas. In February 1985, the Principal Secretary of th e Ministry of Health, Julius Sepeku, complained to medical researchers over the repatriation tendencies and vowed to encourage the use of cinchona bark for the local production of quinine.98 Yet, records documenting the local use of cinchona following the Ministry's comm itments could not be found. Furthermore, in 1990, the government attemp ted to utilise medici nal plants as an alternative source of pharmaceutic al raw materials. Although it took 23 years to implement, this intention had fi rst been pronounced on May 6, 1967, by Tan zania's Minister for Health: Most of the medicines that are needed for curing our normal day-to-day diseases can be obtained from various local plants. Of course, there are some drugs which are of a highly sophisticated nature, whose ra w materials cannot be produced locally or whose production costs far exceed the cost of importation. Such drugs will continue to be imported for a long time.99 Commitments by the Minister for Health stem med from the fact that Tanzania had the richest flora in tropical Africa. In June 1985, the Minister for Health Aaron Chiduo informed the parliament that the country had more than 215 plants spec ies which were effective in addressing several diseases.100 Chiduo's statement was compleme nted by the findings from the Institute of Traditional Medicine (ITM) whic h reaffirmed that the country had about 12,667 plant species of which 1,267 were u tilised in traditional medicine.101 Yet, these species 96 Interview by Andrea Kifyasi with Suleiman Mbon ea Mlungwana, June 6, Doctors,\" Standard , Dar es Salaam, June Mahunnah, Febronia C. Uiso and Edmund J. Kayombo, Documentary of Traditional Medicine in Tanzania: A Traditional Medicine Resource Book (Dar es Salaam: Dar es Salaam University Press, 2012), 8. 239 represented only 10% of the country's flora. This context gave more opportunities for effective utilisation of an almost untapped wealth of medi cal flora by traditional medicine practitioners and pharmaceutical industries. More important ly, the stress on the production of medicines using medicinal herbs was among recommendati ons made in 1990 by the South Commission. Under the Chairmanship of Mwalimu Nyerere, the commission encouraged countries of the South to fully utilise medicinal plants to reduce dependence on imported drugs and pharmaceutical raw materials from abroad.102 Consequently, the 1990's attempt by the Tanzanian government was partly responding to the call by the Southern Commission. Subsequently, in early 1990, the KPI made se veral steps to execut e the government's ambitions of utilising medicinal plants. It firstly collaborated with the Traditional Medicine Research Unit (TMRU), which was under the M uhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences (MUHAS), to launch joint research pr oject on useful medicinal plants as well as production processes. The general projections we re to warrant effectiv e supply of medicinal plants at KPI and modernise the production of traditional medici nes in the country.103 However, there was poor coordination and th e project lacked clearly define d roles for the two institutions, TMRU and KPI. TMRU failed to secure outlets for the products, presumably due to the non- existence of a clear-cut natio nal policy on the production and utilisation of plant-derived pharmaceuticals.104 The coordination between KPI a nd TMRU was vital for effective utilisation of medicinal plants in the health care system. Fo rtunately, at the end of 1990, the government restored the proper coordinatio n between the two institutions, and TMRU submitted herbs to KPI for production trial.105 The TMRU anticipated that KPI would commence production trial immediately upon the recei pt of the raw materials. Nevertheless, the production trial delayed due to bureaucracies in the Ministry of Health, which complicated the issuance of the policy. Up to the end of 1991, there was no policy guiding the production and utilisation of drugs extracted from locally grown plants. Hence, the project collapsed. Informants claimed that external forces from countries importing pharmaceutical raw materials 102 The South Commission, The Challenge to the South (United States: Oxford University Press, 1990), 102. 103 TNA.

Regardless, unnecessary delays in the issuance of the policy provide grounds to accept that there were internal and external forces which compromised initiatives invested in pr oducing drugs using locally grown plants. Ineffective utilisation of me dicinal plants by local pharmaceutical industries prompted their export out of Ta nzania. For instance, Artemisia annua plant (which was commercially produced in Southern Highlands, Northeastern, and Northwestern parts of Tanzania in the 1990s) was extracted and shipped to Europe a nd Asia. In 2002, about 28 tons of artemisinin was destined for shipment to Europe.107 The Artemisia annua plant produces artemisinin raw materials necessary for the production of anti-ma laria medicines. The extracted raw materials were consumed by industries abro ad that produced drugs and then exported them to Tanzania. Worse still, local pharmaceutical industries purc hased APIs for artemisinin from European and Asian companies for the producti on of anti-malarial therapies.108 Stacey Langwick adds that in the 1990s and 2000s, more herbs from Tanzania we re transferred to Chin a and other countries. Traditional Chinese medicine practitioners imported efficacious medicinal herbs from Tanzania and mixed with other Chinese herbs to produce medicines which were used in China and elsewhere, including Tanzania. 109 Thus, the Tanzanian government failed to promote adequate utilisation of medicinal herbs as an alternative source of raw materials in pharmaceutical industries, which negatively affected the efficient production of pharmaceutical industries. 106 Interview by Andrea Kifyasi with Suleiman Mbonea Ml ungwana, June 6, 2018, KPI Silver Sendeu, June 12, 2018, Kimara Bonyokwa, Mzee Sendeu is a former employee at KPI.

The country's economy suffered under several predicaments, including the Uganda- Tanzania War or Kagera War of 1978 to 79, whic h, in turn, affected the survival of several local industries.110 The government faced a severe deficit of foreign currency during and especially after the war. Admitting to the prevailing situation, Nyerere contended: Yet it still true that to a large extent, at our present level of development, it is unavoidable that our industries should be import-dependent. And for the last two years, they have been starved of foreign exchange. As a result, our industrial production has dropped drastically. Measured in constant prices, our industrial output in 1979 was valued at Shs. 1,092 million. In 1980 it had dropped to Shs. 648 million. The industrial sector accounted for 10.4% of our Gross Domestic Product in 1977; in 1981 it accounted for only 5.8% of a smaller GDP. 111 The crisis severely affected the pharmaceuti cal industries. For instance, production at KPI dropped from 335.31 million tablets in 1984 to 44.23 million in 1985.112 It was ill fated that the crisis occurred at a mo ment when China's assistance to Tanzania was less forthcoming. At the end of the 1970s, China lost interest in Africa following its reform and opening-up policy adopted in 1978. Projects funded by the Chines e government in Africa were abandoned, with China providing neither guidance nor financia l assistance. From 1978 onwards, the Chinese government did not pledge to sponsor huge proj ects as it used to in the previous decades.113 The Chinese government established a new way of assisting a few countries with which it had developed a close friendship, incl uding Tanzania. A letter from th e Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Tanzania disclosed that: \"[...] China, as she is now, cannot undertake very big projects as she used to do in the past.

Secondly, raw materials were to be locally available to avoid th e high costs of imports. Thirdly, China's portion of profits had to be remitted to China in foreign exchange. Fourthly, China's contribution to a joint venture was to be less th an 50% of the total inve stment. Fifthly, China's investment was to be in the form of equipment and technical expertise. Above all, the recipient country had to provide land, factory premises , raw materials, opera ting funds, and other necessary facilities. 116 Thus, the Chinese authorities had set aside ideological and political interests in favour of economic gains. Besides the HIV/AIDS research and treatment project funded in 1987 (Chapter 4), the Chinese governme nt did not back the establishment of any meaningful project in Tanzania from the period of 1978 to 1995. Under the joint venture policy, the Chinese government devoted to taking control of projects established under its sponsorship. Accordingly, it assi sted Chinese enterprises to penetrate the African market, invest, and run the enterprises under the government's sponsorship.117 Some Chinese-funded projects in Tan zania, such as the Friendship Textile Factory and Ubungo Farm Implements, were take n over by Chinese enterprises in the 1990s as the Tanzanian government possessed less than 50% of the shares, which enabled Chinese enterprises to exercise the mana gement of the industries entirely.118 I could not find out the reasons that prevented Chinese enterprises from taking control of pharmaceutical industries. However, profit return was the de termining factor for China's co mmitment to a joint venture, and the Chinese government did not see any poten tial from the pharmaceuti cal industries.

Moreover, Mwalimu Nyerere, who was also a close friend of Mao Zedong, perceived the open-door policy as an open betrayal of Maoism.120 Before official endorsement of the polic y, Nyerere sent to China a delegation led by Prime Minister, Edward Moringe Sokoine, in September 1978, to negotiate the new forms of Sino-Tanzanian diplomatic relationship. Chines e officials told Sokoine that their economy was affected by several predicaments such as earthquakes and the declin e in the production of coal and iron. Thus, while the Chinese governme nt focused on reviving the declining economy, it allocated limited resources to foreign assist ance. In 1978 the government also projected reaching the highest level of development sim ilar to superpower nations by 2000. Hence, the government of China utilised most of its reso urces internally to pr omote economic growth.121 To this end, it is apparent that the reform and opening-up policy target ed China's development into an economic superpower more than Maoism, which stressed political hegemony. The hardships outlined above no doubt weak ened China's econom y. Nevertheless, as this study has shown, international aid had also been motivated by the struggle for diplomatic recognition between Mainland China and Taiwan, which, following China's admission had come to a satisfactory end. Thus, diplomatic support from African countries was not a motivation to provide aid; instead , Chinese authorities desired to obtain sophistic ated industrial technology, which African countries could not pr ovide (Chapter 1). The Chinese authorities found it imperative to reconcile with the United States and attr act foreign direct investment (FDIs) to obtain advanced technologies and cap ital for its diffusion to domestic firms, and only industrialised countries in the North could pr ovide that. It was not until the mid-1990s that China acquired technology and advanced industries that seemed to promise their elevation to 119 Some scholars claim that the Chinese government never abandoned projects it funded in the country, see Rwekaza Mukandala, \"From Proud Defiance to Beggary: A Recipient's Tale,\" in Agencies in Foreign Aid: Comparing China, Sweden and the United States in Tanzania , ed.

Fr om the 1980s, countries such as the United Kingdom, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Norway, a nd Netherlands emerged as major donors and technical advisers to the industrial se ctor (Chapter 1).123 Their interventions decreased China's influence on pharmaceutical industries. For instan ce, they advised and formatted KPI with new European-made machines and technologies. The machines installed by Chinese technical experts were perceived to be of small-scale, crude, outdated and unable to keep pace with the growing technology and production demands. T hus, in 1980, Chinese production technology at KPI was phased out and replaced by European technology. 124 The phasing out of Chinese technology was a big blow to the South-Sout h knowledge production and exchange. Yet, China's abandonment of Africa in the peri od from 1978 to 1995 influenced some countries, including Tanzania, to reorient thei r economic destiny toward the North. In the course of these diplomatic shif ts, Tanzania's industries came to rely increasingly on raw materials fr om Northern countries, while imports from China decreased. For example, in 1984, the government of Norway donated to KPI raw materials for aspirin, chloroquine phosphate, chloramphenicol levo, te tracycline hydrochlorid e, mebendazole, and paracetamol. In 1987, Norway donated again to KPI 80,000 kg of granulated aspirin, tablets auxiliary materials, and equipment for the tableting unit.125 Furthermore, in 1990, the government of Sweden donated to KPI six mill ion Swedish kronor for the purchase of raw materials.126 Some traditional donors of the Nort h attempted to rescue Tanzania's pharmaceutical industries through loans. For inst ance, in 1990, the World Bank gave Tanzania 122 Read, for instance, Peter J.

However, on the other hand, it covertly paved th e way for the prompt pe netration of such goods in the Tanzanian market. The preceding exposition illustrates attempts by countries of the North to revitalise local pharmaceutical industries through loans and grants. However, such assistance did not sustainably maintain the efficiency of the government-owned pharmaceutical industries. The question of pharmaceutical raw materials was an swered by loans for the purchase of raw materials and through grants of raw materials purchased from abroad, preferably from donor companies.129 Additionally, the insufficient producti on of medicines by local pharmaceutical factories was addressed through loans for the pur chase of medicines abroad and by donations of some basic medicines.130 I maintain that these kinds of assistance did not provide a lasting solution to the existing drug shortages, a nd the production of pharmaceutical industries collapsed. Instead, they exacerbated the government's debt burden. Loans received by the government from the World Bank and other multi lateral lenders were meant for consumption and not for production. Bought me dicines and equipment were consumed or used, and once finished, the government applie d for the next supply. Donors' assistance was less extended to projects capable of building and maintaining the ability of the Tanzanian government to produce pharmaceutical raw materials and enough medicines through its local industries. 5.8 China's Role in Pharmace utical Knowledge Transmission On June 16, 1964, the Chinese and Tanzan ian governments signed agreements on economic and technical cooperation in which the government of China pledged to offer 127 JMT, Wizara ya Afya, Hotuba File No. KP I/6, Keko Pharmaceutical Indu stries Ltd, Hotuba economic aid and transmit its production technol ogy to Tanzania in the form of equipment, goods, and technical experts.131 The modes of the knowledge exchange were through long- and short-term training of Tanzanian technicians in China, as well as short-term training via special classes in Tanzania and through on-the-job training.132 Accordingly, the Tanzanian government anticipated that the signed cooperation agreements would address the shortfalls of skilled personnel. The Sino-Tanzanian technical cooperation was established at the peak of Cold War politics. During this period, seve ral countries of the North beli eved that Africans were unable to master technology; thus, development projec ts requiring advanced technology had to be discouraged on the continent. For instance, in the mid-1960s, when Tanzania and Zambia were struggling to get funding for the Tanzania-Zambia Railway (TAZARA) project the US government officials declined the project arguing that \"Africans [w ere] too backward to master [its] technology.\"133 In contrast, some Southern count ries did not hesitate to support technologically based projects on the continent. In this vein, the Chinese government's transmission of pharmaceutical knowledge to Tanzania was imperative to challenging racist presumptions and the hegemony of the knowledge from the Global North.134 Nevertheless, I argue that the modus operandi in which China's pharmaceutical knowledge exchange was executed failed to equip local workers with sufficient technical knowledge and managerial skills, which, in turn, retarded efficiency and survival of the pharmac eutical factories (see below). I maintain that the collapse of Ch inese-funded pharmaceutical factories was partly caused by problems with imported technol ogy and the dependency created by it. At its establishment, MVI and KPI recruite d Tanzanians to work with the Chinese technical experts for the sake of knowledge sharing. Many of the recruits were graduates from the University of Dar es Salaam majori ng in chemistry, engineering, and biology.135 Recruits for the MVI worked with Chinese technical e xperts from 1971 to 1979. For the case of KPI, 131 Menghua, \"An Interact ive Perspective,\" 179. 132 Li \"Technology Transfer in Ch ina-Africa Relation: Myth or Reality,\" Transnational Corporations Review 8, (2016): 186, http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19186444.2016.1233718 . 133 Jamie Monson, \"Freedom Railway: The Unexpected Successes of a Cold War Development Project,\" Boston Review (December 2004/January 2005): 2. 134 Comaroff and John L.

Archival and oral testimonies show that neit her the training of technical students in China nor training in the formal classes at the f actory premises was provided. Instead, on-the-job training was privileged . The Chinese government assumed that pharmaceutical knowledge and skills would be swiftly learnt by local workers while on the job.136 Effective on-the-job training involves both theory and practi ce, which integrates trainers and trainees. Consequently, language as a medium of communication was a va luable training tool. Yet, Chinese technical personnel could neither speak fluently the Englis h language nor Kiswahili. Thus, they mostly passed pharmaceutical knowledge to the locals through gesture.137 Such a technique was further used by Chinese technician working in other Chinese-funded projects. Philip Snow writes that in the Tanzania-Zambia Railway (TAZARA) project, Chin ese technician \"would assemble and dismantle a piece of machinery an d encourage his African apprentices to follow suit until they got the procedure right.\"138 This informal way of transmitting knowledge to Tanzanian staff lasted up to June 1976 for th e KPI and until 1979 for MVI. On September 8, 1976, and in 1979, Chinese technical personnel co mpleted their assignment and left the country. Since then, the management and produc tion activities at KPI and MVI was left to Tanzanian personnel.139 Scholarships, which had for certain periods allowed Tanzanian students to train at Chinese universities, were not a solution. It took until 1972 when about 200 Tanzanian and Zambian students received Chinese government scholarships to pursue their studies in transportation, locomotive speciality, and railway engineering. 140 The scholarships for other specialities and to other count ries resumed in 1974, three year s after the handover of the MVI and two years before the handover of the KPI to Tanzanians. Furthermore, in 1978, two years after the handover of KPI, China adopted the open -door policy where it lost interests in Africa. Indeed, the new policy affected the Chinese gover nment scholarships to African students. For instance, scholarship opportunities dropped from 121 in 1978 to 30 in 1979.141 Thus, 136 \"Ripoti ya Quality Control, 1976/7 7,\" TNA. Acc.

In contrast, the Chinese government channelled its scholarships to students studying fo r the TAZARA project since, compared to other projects, the prosperity of TAZARA had a higher geopo litical value in the eyes of the Chinese government. While previous scholarship has used the TAZARA case to draw a sweeping conclusion that Chinese sponsor ed projects in Africa went hand in hand with adequate knowledge transmission to the personnel of the recipient country, the MVI and KPI cases show that there was no effective means of know ledge exchange to the local personnel.142 The management and production at KPI and MVI by Tanzanian staff were a crucial assignment to test the efficiency of the on-th e-job training. Unfortunately, from the beginning, the factories faced technical and managerial hurdles, which signa lled that local personnel were unable to run the factories effectively. The two f actories faced a severe shortage of experts and updated knowledge on the part of the existing personnel. For in stance, soon after the Chinese left, the production of vaccines at MVI was f ound to be below WHO standards. This context discouraged the government and closed the factory shortly.143 Passing on pharmaceutical knowledge through on-the-job training was insufficient. Such challenges were the result of feebleness in structural a nd systematic processes in the establishment and operation of the factory. Phar maceutical industries utilised equipment and machines that demanded a higher level of expert ise to operate effectively. They, therefore, required highly trained and experienced personn el. Nevertheless, the government established the industries while lacking industrial (technical) pharmacists and experienced managerial personnel. Graduates who took over the industries from the Chinese experts lacked effective production and managerial skills. This was because the relevance of the science and engineering knowledge produced at local unive rsities was limited at grounding scientific theories, which were, of course, vital for the founding of pharmaceutical industries. Yet, the knowledge produced lacked applic ation skills. Thus, college graduates who took over the production and managerial activities needed speci fic industrial training to gain production 142 In this article, the author applauds China's role in knowledge transfer to China aid recipient countries.

In 1959, Ri chard Turnbull, then governor of Tanganyika, projected that it would ta ke up to 20 years for the country to have a \"sufficient number of Africans of experience, ability and integrity to fill posts in the public service, and in commerce and industry.\" 144 Pharmaceutical manufacturing was a complicated process involving a wide range of stakeholders whose investments needed financia l and technical preparations before embarking on the production and commercialisation. An effective manufacturing system required specialised skills in several disciplines such as pharmacy, chemistry (analytical, organic, synthetic and medicinal), biol ogical sciences (biochemis try, microbiology and molecular biology), life sciences (medicine, pharmacol ogy and toxicology), management (strategy, financial and management accounting, operati ons, logistics and commercial laws), and information and communication technology (ICT).145 These specialisations were dearly missing in post-colonial Tanzania. Moreover, su ccessful pharmaceutical services included both clinical (hospital, re tail pharmacies) and industrial (techni cal) pharmacy. Regrettably, during both German and the British colonial era, Tang anyika developed these services in one-way traffic, namely clinical pharmacy. Throughout th e colonial period, medical training focused on a few cadres such as dispensing auxiliaries and rural medical aids. It was not until 1940 that the British colonial government introduced co urses in chemical analysis and pharmacy assistantship. Moreover, such attempts were interrupted by the WW II and thus were in the end in vain. Thus, the colonial medical schools trai ned pharmaceutical cadres for hospital and retail pharmacies only. 146 In the post-colonial period, the Ta nzanian government did not shift the paradigm. Instead, it proceeded from where th e colonialists ended by adding training schools for the same medical cadres. The post-colonial government failed to realise the need for industrial (technical) pharmacists who were th e pillars of the development of pharmaceutical 144 Quoted in Sebastian Edwards, Toxic Aid: Economic Collapse and Recovery in Tanzania (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014), 66. 145 UNIDO, Programme for Production of Vaccines in Africa, Technical Report: Programme for Production of Vaccines in Tanzania, Prepared for the Government of the United Republic of Tanzania, on January 6, 1986 , 41. 146 \"Letter from the Director of Medical Services, June 5, 1946 to the Chief Secretary, Dar es Salaam,\" TNA.

Pharmaceutical technicians were re sponsible for drug discovery and manufacturing as well as quality control and utilisation.147 Up to 1972, Tanzania had only 5 African pharmacists who had trained abroad and were hired by the Mansoor Daya and Mabibo V accine plants. It was not until 1974 that the MUHAS launched the School of Pharmacy. The school began as a department in the Faculty of Medicine of the Medical College. Subsequently, from July 1974, the school commenced a three-year course on pharmaceuticals with an an nual intake of 16 students. It was established with the assistance of the British Council, Un ited Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and the WHO. They assisted in the form of experts, equipment, and fellowships. 148 Consequently, the school was established three years after MVI has been handed over to the Tanzanian government, and two years before the handover of KPI. Not surprisingly, the industries faced technical challe nges caused by the lack of skil led local personnel shortly after the handover. Archival sources show that many job applic ants lacked the required qualifications. For instance, KPI advertised a vacancy for production auxiliaries in June 1976, but up to June 1978, there were no qualified applicants.149 The ways in which the Chinese technical experts shared pharmaceutical knowledge with Tanzanians resembles and differs slightly from the Finish technical experts. In April 1976, the Tanzanian government sign ed Tripartite Agreement w ith the National Development Corporation, M/S Orion Yhtyma (OY) Corporation of Finland, and the Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the establishment of Tanzan ia Pharmaceutical Industries (TPI). According to the agreement, the M/S Orion Yhtyma had to provide continuous on-th e-job training for the local staff in Tanzania and advanced three-m onth training for two e xperienced pharmacists in Finland at Orion's premises.150 This attempt, however, did not address the challenge of skilled 147 \"Pharmaceutical Production Technician Training, June 15, 1978,\" TNA.

After three years, the tr ainees had not acquired sufficient knowledge to carry over the factory. Admitting the shortage of personnel, the Director of National Chemical Industries (NCI) asserted: [. . .] as we do not have the experienced te chnical personnel at the Company, NCI's urgent requirement is to have a competent firm whic h can provide the necessary technical backup services to TPI for a given peri od at the same time training the present technical staff. We are therefore requesting the Ministry of Industries and Ministry of Finance to request the Finnish Government to provide us [with] the suggested expatriates possibly from ORION to provide the required technical services up to the end of 1984 and then request UNICEF to take over from ORION for five years thereafter.151 Given that the Chinese and Finnish experts th emselves had spent more than five years studying to qualify, it does not seem altogether su rprising that a few mont hs of training and on- the-job observation proved insufficient. The 2012 United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) report affirms that pharmaceutical knowledge is complicated and would take at least three years or more to train a college grad uate who has a basic qualification in relevant disciplines and to convert the trainee into a skilled pharmaceutical operator.152 The findings of this study support Jamie Monson's observations on the TAZARA project. She contended that the project suffered technical failures because \"the Chinese [technical experts] did not ach ieve their goal of training and supervising enough African technicians to take over the manageme nt of TAZARA after their departure.\"153 She further noted that the railway authority continued to rely on Chinese technical experts after the handover. Yet, Nyerere was overly optimistic that technicians fr om the South would be cheap yet effective compared to experts fr om the North. In his words: My own country has a recent experience of wh at this can mean [South-South technical assistance]. All the technicians in our cement works were from Europe. They were highly paid, with expensive leave and other benefits. But, when they objected to our new Income 151 \"National Chemical Industries, Request Document for Technical Services Assistance to Tanzania Pharmaceutical Industries Limited,\" TN A. Acc.

Moreover, reliance on foreign technicians was inconsis tent with Tanzania's socialist policies, which upheld self- dependency. In this way, the Chinese pledge of \"teaching Tanzanians how to fish and not giving them a fish\" did not yield sustainable results. 5.9 Conclusion This chapter has shown how China, an emerging donor of the Global South, pledged to assist Southern countries distinct from tr aditional donors of the Gl obal North. Its assistance was expected to promote self-dependency in Af rican countries since it was executed under the framework of the South-South cooperation, whic h perceived economic a nd technological self- sufficiency as the primary weapon in the figh t against imperialism, colonialism, and neo- colonialism. Nevertheless, this chapter has show n that China's assistance to the establishment of pharmaceutical indust ries in Tanzania rath er sustained the count ry's dependency on pharmaceutical raw materials and technicians from China. Such dependencies were caused, for instance, by the ill-conceived mechanisms of knowledge exchange, which failed to pass on sufficient technical knowledge an d managerial skills to local personnel. Moreove r, capacity building for the local production of pharmaceutical raw materials remained marginal while the country relied heavily on peri odic imports. The chapter has main tained that aid provided only short-term relief to technologica l, economic, political, and soci al challenges facing recipient countries. In the absence of loans, grants, and technical experts fr om the donor countries, production and management of the government-o wned pharmaceutical industries declined. 154 Julius K.

They furthe r denounced assistance w ith strings attached, which would perpetuate dependencies.1 Consistently, in 1964, the Chinese government formulated principles governing its economic and technical aid to foreign countries, which resonated with the priorities advo cated by African and Asian countries.2 I n t h e s a m e v e i n , following the Arusha Declaration of 1967, the Tan zanian government set itself an agenda of socialism and self-reliance. With these two principles, it anticipated getting rid of exploitation, enhancing the government's control of the majo r means of production and its effective use of local resources as primary agents of developm ent. The government welcomed assistance which promised to help the country to move through a transition to wards self-reliance.3 Against such backdrop, this study has examined the implica tions of China's medical assistance for the development of Tanzania's health sector und er the discourse of Southern solidarity. It specifically aimed at assessing the extent to which China's medical assistance reflected the Southern agenda of promoting self-reliance and lessening the dominance of countries of the North in medical aid and knowledge to the Sout h. After exploring the social, economic, and political contexts that gave birth to China's me dical assistance in Tan zania, this study discussed several major Chinese-funded health projects in independent Tanzania, assessing them in the light of Tanzania's nation-building agenda a nd its role in promoting new medical knowledge and self-reliance within Ta nzania's health sector. 1 See, for instance, The Ministry of Fo reign Affairs, Republic of Indonesia, Final Communique of the Asian- African Conference of Bandung, April 24, 1955 ; Executive Committee of the Af ro-Asian Peoples' Solidarity Organisations, Afro-Asian Peoples' Solidarity Movement (Cairo), 8. 2 Read, for instance, Eight Principles for Economic and Technical Aid Contended by Premier Zhou Enlai when Answering Questions from Reporters of the Ghana News Agency on January 15, 1964 in Ghana, in Afro-Asian Solidarity Against Imperialism: A Collection of Document s, Speeches and Press Interv iews from the Visits of Chinese Leaders to Thirteen African and Asian Countries (Peking: Foreign Languages Press, 1964), 149. 3 URT, The Arusha Declaration and TANU's Policy on Socialism and Self-Reliance (Dar es Salaam: Publicity Section, 1967); Julius K.

Some studies have examined the activities of Chinese medical docto rs in Africa without fully establ ishing the contexts that gave rise to such programs. A dditionally, some medical aid projects funded by the Chinese government in Africa, such as pharmaceutical in dustries, HIV/AIDS research and treatment, and the anti-malaria campaign have received littl e or no scholarly atten tion. The majority of the publications about China's medical assistance to the South are not historical studies but are from fields of political sc ience and anthropology focusing on China's recent medical diplomacy, the practice of traditional Chinese medicine in private clinics and other current issues. Such works do not show the subtle changes in the projects over time nor their implications in promoting self-reliance and South-South medical knowledge exchange. Yet, available primary sources allow for a more nuanced historical research. Despite the existence of Sino-African rela tions before and during colonisation, the relationships became direct and robust during the 1950s, prompted by Cold War politics, which called for the Bandung Conference in 1955. 4 The conference gave rise to the Afro-Asian Peoples' Solidarity Organisation (AAPSO) in 1957, which spearheaded Southern solidarity, thereby underscoring the need for African a nd Asian countries to assist one another economically, politically, socially and techno logically. As shown in Chapter 1, China's medical assistance to Tanzania was partly influe nced by the ideal of Southern solidarity, and the \"Eight Principles\" governing economic and technical assi stance to the South articulated by Premier Zhou Enlai in 1964, which became a blue print for bilateral medical assistance. However, I argue that China's assistance was motiv ated by its aspirations to attain political and economic power in a global context. Indee d, China's dominance in the AAPSO won the country influence and recognition by many Afri can and Asian countries, which, in turn, enabled China to establish grounds for political and economic hegemony. China's medical assistance to Tanzania was a reciprocal process. The assistance was executed at the moment when both governments needed assistance fr om each other. As discussed in Chapter 1, at independence, the Tanzanian government lacked skilled medical personnel and it imported all pharmaceuticals from abroad. Only twelve registered Tanzanian 4 For more on the pre-colonial China-Africa relations, see: Abdul Sheriff, Dhow Cultures of the Indian Ocean: Cosmopolitanism, Commerce and Islam (New York: Columbia University Press, 2010); For more on China- Africa relations during the colonial period, see: Juhani Koponen, Development for Exploitation : German Colonial Policies in Mainland Tanzania 1884-1914, (Hamburg: LIT Verlag, 1994), 348. 255 medical doctors were on record, and the di sease burden outweighed their capacity. Furthermore, in the mid-1960s, th e country encount ered diplomatic rifts with West Germany, Britain, and the USA, which limited assistance from the North. Such conditions underpinned the Tanzanian government's relian ce on Chinese assistance. While external medical assistance was a necessity to the Tanzanian government, the Chinese prioritised getting recognition in the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). Upon learning about the influence of Tanzanian President, Julius K. Nyerere, in Africa, Chin ese diplomats lobbied so that Nyerere and his delegate would contribute votes that would grant China recogn ition in the UNGA. Eventually, while the Tanzanian government needed China's me dical assistance to enhance the capacity of its health sector, the Chinese government needed Tanzania's support in the UNGA. Yet, diplomacy and politics were not the onl y binding factors that aligned Tanzania's interests with those of the Chinese. Instead, th e socialist health policies which the Tanzanian government adopted after the Arusha Declara tion of 1967 echoed many ideas of the Chinese health system. As elaborated at length in Chapte r 2, Tanzania's Ministry of Health (MoH) sent medical delegates to China to study the practi cality of China's socialist health system. The delegates recommended the MoH to adopt free health care, institu tionalise traditional medicine, ban private health se rvices and promote ru ral health care. The recommended policies were espoused and practised by the Tanzanian government in the 1960s and 1970s. I maintain that the adopted policies responded to the needs of the government for healthy people and thus human resources. For instance, the extension of ru ral health care was imperative to improving the welfare of peasants for e ffective production of both food and cash crops. Additionally, the provision of free health care was conducive to sexual reprod uction and reduced mortality and morbidity rates which, in turn, would boost th e nation's economy. The adoption of Chinese health policies contested the conceptions about the production and transmission of knowledge and experiences from the Northern \"core\" to the Southern \"peri phery\" and bespoke the Tanzanian government's endeavour to foster Southern solidarity by l earning from so-called peripheral countries. I argue that China's economic , political and social influences on Southern countries should be perceived as a \"paradigm shift\" since it challenged the core countries and reduced their ability to remain as the key donors. Questions about the effectiveness of th e South-South medical knowledge exchange has been discussed in Chapters 3, 4 and 5 of this study. Knowledge exchange was the main agenda of the African and Asian countries sin ce it was the central means of attaining self- reliance. Moreover, it was the seventh of the \"Eight Principles\" of China's foreign aid 256 proclaimed by Zhou in 1964.5 China's aid vision won trust from the Tanzanian government, which perceived its assistance as a bridge to self-reliance.6 The Chinese government employed different means to foster exchanges of me dical knowledge to local medical doctors and technical pharmacists. They included long and s hort-term training of Tanzanians in China and on-the-job training. Overall, however, the educati on and training of local experts did not rank high among the Chinese government's prioriti es. The Chinese government did not provide enough scholarships for Tanzanians to pursue medical and pharmaceutical studies in China during the period from 1968 to 1990. While few s hort-term training programmes were offered to local medical doctors in Beijing, similar training was not offered to pharmaceutical technicians nor traditional Tanzanian medicine researchers and practitioners. Moreover, the Cold War politics defeated long-term traini ng since medical gradua tes from China were deemed incompetent by their colleagues schoole d at Makerere Univer sity and universities located in the North. Such unevenness and tens ion discouraged Tanzanians from accepting Chinese government scholarships for medical trai ning in China and hindered the production of medical knowledge and exchange. Furthermore, the modus operandi of knowledge exchange was unsustainable. The Chinese government mostly preferred on-the-job training, expecting local workers in hospitals and pharmaceutical industries to acquire adequate medical knowle dge while collaborating with Chinese experts. Moreover, langua ge barriers impeded training and exchange, as many Chinese experts neither spoke fluent English nor Kisw ahili. Instead, as shown in Chapter 3, Chinese medical doctors spent most of their time providing clinical care instead of training local medical doctors. Contrary to most scholarly acco unts, which maintained that Chinese experts working in Africa transmitted the knowledge effectively to local workers, 7 my findings suggest that on-the-job training failed in this regard. As discussed in Chapter 5, immediately after Chinese technicians had left, the production of vaccines at the Mabibo factory stopped since the vaccines produced fell below WHO sta ndards. Similarly, the Keko Pharmaceutical Industries collapsed because of unskill ed personnel and poor management. 5 Read, for instance, Afro-Asian Solidarity against Imperialism , 149. 6 Read a speech by President Julius K.

Up to 2012, the country had about 12,667 plant species of which 1,267 were utilis ed in traditional medicine practices.8 The South- South Commission further recommended the use of traditional medicine as the best way of restoring self-reliance to countries in the South.9 Therefore, traditional medicine had a key role to play in addressing global he alth challenges. Nevertheless, de spite the richness in flora, traditional medicine practitioners utilised only 10% of medicinal plants. I argue that effective use of herbal medicine in parallel with biomed icine was imperative in addressing global health challenges and in maintaining se lf-support in Southern countries. Regrettably, as Chapter 5 reveals, several political and technical bureaucr atic impediments hampered attempts to use local medicinal plants to produce medicines at Keko Pharmaceutical Industries. By contrast, medicinal herbs from Tanzania were exporte d overseas, and the government normalised the importation of pharmaceutical raw materials for its industries. Furthermore, the emergence and practices of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) had a vital impact on promoting medical knowledge fr om the South. As described in Chapter 4, TCM gained influence during the 1960s and was positively received by different groups of Tanzanians. Moreover, China's engagement in research and treatment of HIV/AIDS using TCM was an essential contribu tion to global health. The Tanzanian government hoped that TCM practitioners could boost medical knowledge ex change with local traditional medicine researchers and practitioners while reducin g the country's dependency on medicine and medical knowledge from the North. However, trad itional medicine researchers from Tanzania were less involved in TCM research and treatmen t projects because the Chinese interventions in diseases were empowered by faith a nd perceived TCM knowledge and technology superiority. In this vein, they devalued the knowledge and abil ities of traditional medicine researchers and practitioners from Tanzania. Such circumstances existed because achievements of the research and treatment projec ts would have triggered scientific, economic, and political consequences of signi ficance to the Chinese government. Dependency theory has maintained that ec onomic and political relationships between the \"rich\" countries of the North and the \"poor\" countries of the South were unbalanced and 8 Rogasian L. A.

Th ey further maintain that countries of the North exploited resources and maintained their national interests in th e South through different means, including foreign assistance.10 However, I argue that a \"national interest\" agenda attached to foreign assistan ce can be exercised by any donor country, regardless of its economic, political, technological or social achievements, with assi stance directly or indirectly projecting the interests of donor countries onto recipient countries. The major findings of this study departed fr om those of research literature which maintain that Southern countries a ssisted one anothe r altruistically.11 Discussions in Chapters 3, 4, and 5 showed that the Chinese-funded health projects intertwined political and economic interests. For instance, from the inception of the medical cooperation in 1968 to 1977, the Chinese government pursued more political and less economic interests through its assistance extended to Tanzania. Political interests were in fluenced by its battle over political recognition against Taiwan in the UNGA. It was fu rther complicated by Mao Zedong's political propaganda against US imperialis m and Soviet revisionist polic ies in the South. Therefore, China's assistance throughout the 1960s to 1970s primarily aimed at winning votes for recognition and admission in the UNGA. However, after the reform and opening-up policy of 1978, its assistance to Afri ca took a new direction. During th is period, the Chinese government reduced foreign assistance in favour of economic relationships with countries of the North. For example, it was no longer ready to supply free raw materials to pharmaceutical factories it funded in Tanzania. Moreover, the activities of the Chinese doctors in Tanzania were restructured to promote and popularise the use of medicines manufactured in China. Under the new policies, economic interests overwhelmed geopolitical interest s since the Chinese government intended to become an economically powerful nation by the year 2000.12 Therefore, while the Tanzanian government pe rceived medical assistance from China as a 10 Read, for instan ce, Dambisa Moyo, Dead Aid: Why Aid Is not Working and How There Is a Better Way for Africa (New York, NY: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2009); Sebastian Edwards, Toxic Aid: Economic Collapse and Recovery in Tanzania (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014). 11 See, for instance, Li Anshan, \" China-Africa Medical Cooperation: Another form of Humanitarian Aid ,\" accessed May 1, 2016, http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/china-africa-medical-cooperation-another-form- humanitarian-aid ; Ding Ying, \"Healing Angels from China: Medi cal Teams from China Fi ght Death and Disease in the Harshest Environments in Africa,\" Beijing Review , September 22, 2011. 12 \"Ziara 12/9/1978 hadi 15/9/1978,\" ZNA.

The aspiration to make Tanzania self-d ependent had its roots in the mid-1960s, following its diplomatic rifts with traditiona l donors of the North. Li ke other newly founded African states, Tanzania percei ved industrialisation as not only a bridge to self-reliance but also a symbol of economic progress. Subse quently, the government established several industries and sought technical and financial support from other countries to achieve its industrialisation agenda. I argue that Tanzania's industrialisati on spirit was an ideological fall- out of imperialism since it was equated with development, particularly the development bridging the gap between the al ready industrialised Global No rth countries and the semi- industrialised countries of the South. Under this strategy, the Tanzanian government aimed to block the massive importation of medicines by establishing pha rmaceutical industries which could produce them locally. Such import substitution programs gained support from structuralist and dependence theori sts who have explained poverty in Southern countries as the result of the relationship be tween European and North Amer ican nations with so-called underdeveloped countries. These theorists, howev er, have overlooked the role played by less industrialised but powerful countries such as Cu ba, India and China in retarding development in Southern countries. 13 From this misconception, political elites in Africa perceived donors from the South as \"saviours\" and those from the North as \"exploiters\".14 Yet, such conceptions maintained the trust of political elites in Tanzania in Asian and Latin American governments. Similarly, government authorities in Tanzan ia perceived China's sponsorships for the establishment of pharmaceutical industries as emancipatory. Undeniably, with its socialist ideol ogy, the Chinese government attained a considerably higher level of self-dependency s oon after the 1949 revolutio n. It was, therefore, regarded as a development model in several Global South countries, including Tanzania. In December 1967, a delegation led by Pius Msekwa, (then Tanganyika African National Union (TANU) Executive Secretary), visited China and showed admiration of China's development and Maoism. Msekwa said: \"You are able to make great political, military and economic 13 Randall M. Packard, A History of Global Health: Interventions into the Lives of other Peoples (Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2016), 239; also see Edwards, Toxic Aid, 24-25. For more detailed information about this structural relationship, see; Walter Rodney, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa (Washington DC: Howard University Press, 1982). 14 Read, for instance, Paul Tiyambe Zeleza, \"Danci ng with Dragon: Africa's Courtship with China,\" The Global South 2, no. 2 (Fall 2008): 174. 260 achievements because you have the correct t hought guiding you, that is, the thought of Mao- Tse-tung. China has set an excellent example for us in taking the road of self-reliance. Tanzania must take this road too. It's the only road to make our country strong and prosperous.\"15 From this perception, China's pledge to support the establishment of pharmaceutical industries was positively hailed, believing that it would reduce the country's dependence on imported pharmaceuticals. However, as presented in Ch apter 5, the pharmaceutical industries of Keko and Mabibo failed to promote the country's self -reliance agenda since they faced managerial and technical challenges, which led to their decline in the 1980s and 1990s consecutively. The main reasons behind their collap se included poor management, poor feasibility stud ies, lack of enough qualified local personnel, and lack of su fficient funds to purchase raw pharmaceutical materials. I maintain that the Chinese-f unded industrial projects were conceived under ineffective structural settings with a short-trained managerial team, inadequate local trained personnel, and unsustainable s ources of industrial raw mate rials. All these challenges hampered the local production of pharmaceutical s, which, in turn, curtailed Tanzania's aspirations for self-reliance. In closing, this research has shown that Ch ina's medical assistan ce to post-colonial Tanzania hardly functioned as a solution to health challenges that faced the Tanzanian government. Its modes of executions were incons istent with Tanzania's self-reliance agenda. The assistance created unforeseen dependen ces on Chinese medical doctors, pharmaceutical raw materials, traditional Chinese medicine, and pharmaceutical technicians from China. Findings of this study have shown that whenev er Chinese assistance was withdrawn, most of the medical projects declined. Such circumstan ces warrant the conclusion that Chinese aid only offered short-term relief to several challenge s facing the health sector in Tanzania. For instance, under the Chinese medical team progr am, Chinese doctors saved the lives of many patients and donated drugs, which, in turn, assi sted Tanzanians in getting access to basic medicines. However, after Chinese doctors le ft and the donated medicinal supplies were depleted, inadequacies of skilled medical personnel and the lack of basic medicines persisted. Similarly, Chinese sponsorship of pharmaceutical industries helped the Tanzanian government to kick-start the production of several kinds of medicines. Nevertheless, shortages of pharmaceutical technicians and raw materials resu lted in Tanzania's dependency on China. 15 \"TANU Team Flies to S.
