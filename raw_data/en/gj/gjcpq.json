It has proved to be particularly useful in relieving mental health ailments and afflictions. There are various techniques to learn that fall under the \"energy healing\" method.

It might just change your life. Here Is A List Of 14 Energy Healing Techniques You Can Learn: #1 Pranic Healing Pranic Healing is a form of ancient energy medicine, that utilizes the inherent energy Prana to promote the body's energy and its processes. This technique was developed by Master Choa Kok Sui and is part of a new age \"energy medicine\" field that has its roots in ancient Eastern tradition. According to Master Choa Kok Sui, the body is a self-repairing living entity that possesses the innate ability to heal itself. The main focus of the Pranic Healing training session is on how the chakras process, absorb, and distribute prana. Note - the teachers of [Pranic Healing](https://www.insightstate.com/spirituality/pranic-healing/) insist that this method of alternative medicinal therapy does not have any intentions to replace the traditional ways of medicine. #2 Reiki [Reiki is a healing art](https://www.insightstate.com/spirituality/five-reiki-principles-percepts-explained/) that comes from a combination of two Japanese words. The first word is \"rei,\" which translates as \"universe or higher power wisdom.\" The second word is \"ki,\" which translates as \"life force energy.\" Contrary to some beliefs, this energy healing method is not a religious practice but a spiritual one. This system was created by Usui Mikao in Japan in the early 1900s. He brought together various elements from his own spiritual practices to develop this system. In the present day, [Reiki](https://www.insightstate.com/spirituality/reiki-attunements-side-effects/) is listed in the Holistic Nursing \"Scope and Standards of Practice\" as an accepted form of care. A full Reiki treatment covers all the organs, glands, and main energy centers of the body. Note - the person channeling the Reiki energy does not cure the person receiving the treatment. #3 Karmic Regression Therapy With the help of this method, you can tap into the energetic karma in a very safe and rewarding way, creating personal development and transformation. Other benefits include the following: - discovering a non-temporal view of conscious experience and regression; - discovering [karmic and past lives influences](https://www.insightstate.com/spirituality/karmic-relationships-connections-love/); - uncovering a holographic view of regression; - clearing bad [karma](https://www.insightstate.com/spirituality/21-good-karma-quotes-sayings/); - releasing from the experiences which hold us back; - rewriting our soul contracts; - understanding our reactions to locations; - discovering our soul mates and soul group; - exploring our connections to people and places; - clearing birth trauma; - healing trauma; - learning more about ourselves and the person we truly are; - changing emotional problems. #4 Acupuncture Acupuncture is an ancient Chinese form of medicine that uses needles to manipulate the vital energy within the patient's body. In traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture is linked to the belief that disease is caused by disruptions to the flow of energy in the body. Research suggests that acupuncture can help relieve pain, and it is used for a wide range of other complaints. Currently, it is used to treat conditions like: - depression; - muscle pain and spasms; - digestive problems; - allergies; - knee pain; - chronic back problems and pain; - osteoarthritis; - neck pain; - headaches, including reducing the frequency and intensity of migraines. #5 Qigong Qigong is a form of gentle exercise that is composed of movements that are repeated a number of times, increasing fluid movement and building awareness of how the body moves through space. It also enhances our ability to feel the Life Force underlying the physical world and to deepen our communication with it. Additionally, Qigong opens the flow of energy in meridians used in Chinese medicine and acupuncture. Note - along with supporting general wellbeing and health, the practice is the internal foundation of all of the martial arts. #6 Quantum-Touch This method was created by Richard Gordon, and it is based on a combination of various healing techniques such as Qi Gong. The Quantum-Touch techniques teach us how to focus and amplify life-force energy by combining various body awareness and breathing exercises. Advanced techniques used in Quantum-Touch include spinning the chakras, structural alignment, harmonic toning, and distance healing. #7 Transpersonal Psychology Transpersonal psychology is a sub-field of psychology that integrates the spiritual and transcendent aspects of the human experience with the framework of modern psychology. It began in the late 1960s, as an attempt to establish a \"fourth force\" in psychology, following the behaviorist, psychodynamic, and humanistic approaches. In her book \"Eyes Wide Open: Discernment on the Spiritual Path,\" Mariana Caplan explains: \"Transpersonal psychologists attempt to integrate timeless wisdom with modern Western psychology and translate spiritual principles into scientifically grounded, contemporary language.\" #8 Theta Healing It is a technique that focuses on prayer and thought. Theta Healing was developed in 1995 by Vianna Stibal. Note - Theta Healing is compatible with any spiritual or religious belief system because it is a technique, not a religion, and is not affiliated with any religious doctrine. #9 Healing Touch Founded by registered nurse Janet Mentgen in 1989, Healing Touch is an energy therapy in which practitioners use their hands and intent to promote healing and health. This method is based on the belief that human beings are fields of energy that are in constant interaction with others and the environment. #10 Emotional Freedom Technique It is a revolutionary treatment method that offers healing from emotional and physical pain and disease. This therapy method was first introduced in the 1990s by Gary Craig, who considered his approach to be an effective combination of acupressure techniques and mind-body medicine. The Emotional Freedom Technique operates on the premise that no matter what part of your life needs improvement, there are unresolved emotional issues in the way. #11 Shamanic Energy Healing Shamanic energy healing is a powerful tool for self-healing and personal transformation. With shamanic energy healing, we can find our way back to our true selves and step into our power as healers and warriors of the light. A shamanic healer knows how to manipulate and move the energy of another's body. In addition, he can pass on wisdom from the spirit realm. Note - shamanism is a life calling. There are no schools, and rarely can you find two shamans doing a treatment the same way. #12 Ruach Healing Method It combines Kabbalah, Hermetics, Reiki, and Ancient Energy Healing techniques to codify a unique healing system. The technique teaches students to \"scan\" the [aura](https://www.insightstate.com/spirituality/aura-colors/), to assess areas of energetic congestion and depletion. This helps identify problem areas that need healing.

References to it have been discovered in ancient scrolls and in the Egyptian Book of the Dead. Note - Sekhem Healing is similar to Reiki, but it has its own distinctive vibrational frequency. Some of the benefits of Sekhem Healing are: - accelerates the infinite process of spiritual development; - increases awareness of who we are; - increases our feeling of aliveness by bringing us more fully into the present; - increases our psychic abilities to see energy; - assists us in manifesting our goals. #14 Tibetan New Method - Prananadi Energy Healing Prananadi is an ancient Tibetan healing method that has been practiced by lamas in Tibet. The practice of Prananadi helps to balance the flow of prana throughout the body, promoting physical and mental well-being. There are three main nadis, or channels: the Ida, Pingala, and Sushumna. The Ida and Pingala crisscross each other like the strands of a rope, while the Sushumna runs along the spine. The use of Prananadi releases blocked energy pathways. It works independently of faith and religion. Images credit - Shutterstock & Getty Images READ THIS NEXT: "}
