The machine-vision-equipped ROVERs navigate throughout virtual maps providing researchers with an infinitely scalable integration solution. Scalable for Any Lab The ROVER Laboratory Automation Platform allows for efficient use of lab space and easily expands as your lab's needs change and grow. ROVERs can drive on tracks suspended from the ceiling, coupled with elevators, allowing plates to be transferred between instrumentation without occupying floor space. The adaptive and dynamic traffic management software enables easy integration over a simple API. The ROVERs self-navigate within a defined laboratory space, utilizing downward-facing cameras and barcode-encoded mats. The need for precise calibration is eliminated by utilizing real-time visual alignment as the ROVERs interface with instruments during plate transfers. Specifications Size: 186 mm x 105 mm x 116 mm Weight: 2 kg Battery Life: 3 hours Average Travel Speed: 300 mm/s Load Weight: up to 0.650 kg "}
