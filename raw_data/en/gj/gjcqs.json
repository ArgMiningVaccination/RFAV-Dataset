How, exactly, is a nutritionist advising fish oil as part of the diet \"undermining meaningful research\" when scientists the world over keep finding benefit from EPA and DHA in fish oil? Perhaps his arguement is convincing because he violates the very spirit of evidence-based medicine he accuses nutritionists of - \"...they cherry pick the literature, selecting only favourable studies and ignoring the overall picture.\" - when he himself cherry picks the media, finds those examples favorable to his arguement and then reasons we should all fear nutritionists, all the while he ignores the overall picture of the complementary nature allopathic and naturopathic can offer together if given opportunity to do so. \"...most corrosive is the way they misrepresent, from their position of dominance in the mainstream media, what scientific evidence for a clinical assertion would actually look like. Food gurus extrapolate wildly, creating hypotheses from metabolism flow charts or interesting theoretical laboratory bench data, and then using them to justify a clinical intervention.\" We all know this happens in conventional medicine too, yet few are railing against all medicine because a few cranks exist among the ranks of licensed physicians. \"Nutrition is one of the few areas where the notion of scientific evidence for health interventions is popularly discussed: the nutritionists take this opportunity and use it to promote the public misunderstanding of science, laying fertile ground for health scares and a misled population...most offensive to me, as a hard working NHS doctor, is the way that media nutritionists assume the moral high ground, as if they were somehow the source of all that is right and good in the management of lifestyle risk factors for cardiovascular disease and cancer.\" So we're to accept the notion that the views of conventional medicine and established consensus on diet are the only \"right\" and \"good\" for us and everything else, anything that is not scientifically \"proven\" is wrong, misguided, distorted, and even dangerous to consider in the management of risk factors? If you ask me, a rational and reasonable person can and will see the value of both conventional medicine and naturopathic approaches to well-being; neither on their own provides a balaced view; but when allopathic and naturopathic are taken together a very powerful, and underutilized way to prevent and treat risks emerges to provide balance and options, where before there was only this or that, there is now this and that. Perhaps Dr. Goldacre will agree that over the years much of our newly accumulated knowledge in the area of nutrition is specifically because much of the \"old wives tales\" of yore are being sceintifically scrutinized and found to have merit? Funny how that happens when something seems to work and a researcher somewhere hears about it and decides to give the best science can offer in an attempt to "}
