It focuses on the study of Qi, or vital energy, which runs through the human body and supports overall health. Imagine Qi flowing through your body like a complex system of roads and highways. Just like a road accident leads to a backup on the freeway, Qi can be slowed or stopped without care and attention. We work with you to restore and support your natural flow of energy. The most common treatments include acupuncture and herbal supplements. You can use TCM on its own or as a complement to other medical care. The holistic approach of TCM supports a healthy mind-body connection. You may use it to: - Treat side effects of conventional medicine. - Boost the effectiveness of conventional medicine. - Reduce the necessary dose of conventional medicine. - Treat conditions that don't respond well to conventional medicine.

Acupuncture stimulates specific points along the channels of energy running through the body. During treatment, an acupuncturist gently inserts fine needles into your skin. They place the needles in precise locations to treat your concerns and restore your health. Scientists are studying how acupuncture works. There is some evidence that acupuncture works by stimulating the nervous system. This triggers the body to release chemicals and hormones that affect how we feel and influence other parts of the body's regulatory system. The needles are fine and smooth, so you will likely feel little or no pain. You may find the treatments relaxing. What is Chinese herbal medicine? Chinese herbs are often used with acupuncture to support a healthy energy balance. In the United States, Chinese herbs are considered supplements, not medicine, and are available over the counter. While these supplements are generally safe, there are important benefits to using them under the care of a licensed professional. Overuse or misuse can be dangerous, especially without an understanding of your health history and medication list.
