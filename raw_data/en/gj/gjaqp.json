Here at Align 33 Chiropractic we use acupuncture therapy to help treat a multitude of conditions and patients looking to achieve optimal overall health. Acupuncture originates from China and has been practiced there for thousands of years. This Traditional Chinese Medicine (TMC) can be used to treat many conditions and illness for men and women today. Acupuncture involves inserting very thin needles through a patient's skin at specific points on the body to various depths. How does acupuncture work? Traditional Chinese Medicine looks at the flow of energy within the body, this energy is known as 'qi'. Acupuncture points are located on meridians (pathways) through which qi vital energy runs. The balance of the complementary extremes of yin and yang and the life force known as qi or chi are what drives TMC. There are 350 acupuncture points in the body that these meridians and energy flows can be accessed. When needles are inserted into these points with appropriate combinations it is said that the energy flow can be brought back into proper balance. The benefits of acupuncture...
