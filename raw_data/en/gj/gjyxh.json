Measles elimination: the situation in a large geographical area in which endemic transmission of measles has stopped and sustained transmission does not occur following the occurrence of an imported case; continued intervention measures are required. Measles eradication: interruption of measles transmission worldwide as a result of deliberate efforts; intervention methods may no longer be needed. Eradication represents the sum of successful elimination efforts in all countries.

It is estimated that in 1998 about 30 million people contractedmeasles and that 875 000 of them died. Measles vaccine provides long-term immunity against the disease. Adequately chosen and implemented vaccination strategies not only reduce mortality and morbidity but also interrupt the transmission of indigenousmeasles virus. The WHO/UNICEF Measles Mortality Reduction and Regional Elimination Strategic Plan, 2001-2005 outlines the following strategies for reducing measles mortality: \u00b7 providing the first dose of measles vaccine to successive cohorts of infants; \u00b7 ensuring that all children have a second opportunity for measles vaccination; \u00b7 enhancing measles surveillance with integration of epidemiological and laboratory information; \u00b7 improving the management of every measles case. The objective of this document is to provide guidelines to public health workers at all levels on the best measles surveillance practices.IntroductionModule on best practices for measles surveillance 2The organism Measles is an acute illness caused by a virus of the genus Morbillivirus , a member of the paramyxovirus family. Transmission Measles is one of the most infectious diseases. The virus can be transmitted in the air, in respiratory droplets, or by direct contact with the nasal and throat secretionsof infected persons. Individuals with measles are considered to be infectious as from two to four days before the onset of rash until four days after the latter stage. Clinical features After an incubation period that usually lasts for 10-12 days but ranges from 7 to18 days, prodromal symptoms of fever, malaise, cough, coryza (runny nose) and conjunctivitis (pink eye) appear in non-immune persons exposed to the virus.Koplik spots may occur on the buccal mucosa shortly before the onset of rash and for about 1-3 days subsequently. However, the absence of Koplik spots does not rule measles out. Within 2-4 days after the prodromal symptoms begin, a rashof large blotchy red spots, called a maculopapular rash, appears behind the ears and on the face. At this stage a high fever develops, the temperature possibly reaching 40.6 0C (105 0F). The rash spreads to the trunk and extremities, typically lasts for 3-7 days, and may be followed by a fine desquamation. A non-productive cough is present throughout the febrile period, lasting for 1-2 weeks in uncomplicated cases. Complications from measles include otitis media, pneumonia, diarrhoea, blindness and encephalitis. In developed countries the case-fatality rate for measles tends to be low, between 0.1 and 1.0 per 1000 cases. In developing countries the overall case-fatality rate has been estimated to be between 3% and 6%. The highestcase-fatality rate occurs in infants under 12 months of age, among whom it reaches between 20% and 30%. Malnutrition and infection with human immunodeficiency virus are risk factors for complications and mortality. Immunity Natural infection produces lifelong immunity. Asymptomatic, IgM-positive personshave not been found to be infectious.The organism, the disease and the vaccine3 WHO/V&B/01.43Measles vaccine Many live, further attenuated measles virus vaccines are in use. Most of them were derived from the Edmonston strain. Measles antibodies develop in approximately85% of children vaccinated at 9 months of age, 95% of children vaccinated at 12 months of age, and 98% of those vaccinated at 15 months of age. In consideration of the age at infection and the case-fatality ratio, WHO recommends vaccination at9 months of age in countries at the mortality reduction stage. Measles vaccine provides lifelong immunity in most people. A response is given to a second dose by a high proportion of vaccinated persons who lack detectable antibody.Module on best practices for measles surveillance 4In 1989 the World Health Assembly defined a specific goal for measles control: \"reduction in measles incidence of 90% from preimmunization levels by 1995\".In 1990 the World Summit for Children endorsed the following goal: \"reduction by 95% in measles deaths and reduction by 90% of measles cases compared to preimmunization levels by 1995, as a major step to global eradication of measles inthe longer run\". The World Summit for Children also set a target of 90% coverage with measles vaccine and other vaccines used in the Expanded Programme on Immunization by 2000. Furthermore, targets for the regional elimination of measleshave been established in the Region of the Americas, the European Region and the Eastern Mediterranean Region by 2000, 2007 and 2010 respectively. The 2001-2005 global strategic plan seeks to reduce measles mortality worldwide. Its goals are: \u00b7 to halve the annual number of deaths by 2005 relative to 1999 estimates; \u00b7 to achieve and maintain the interruption of indigenous transmission in large geographical areas with established elimination goals (including elimination in the Region of the Americas by 2000 and progress towards elimination in the European Region by 2007 and the Eastern Mediterranean Region by 2010); \u00b7 to convene a global consultation in 2005, in collaboration with other major partners, in order to review progress and assess the feasibility of globaleradication. As mentioned in the Introduction, four strategies are recommended for reducing mortality attributable to measles and achieving the elimination of the disease: \u00b7 providing the first dose of measles vaccine to successive cohorts of infants; \u00b7 ensuring that all children have a second opportunity for measles vaccination; \u00b7 enhancing measles surveillance with integration of epidemiological and laboratory information; \u00b7 improving the management of every measles case. In addition, with a view to reducing overall childhood mortality, vitamin A supplementation should be provided through immunization services.Goals and strategies for global measles mortality reduction and regional elimination5 WHO/V&B/01.43Surveillance objectives Surveillance is ongoing systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of outcome-specific data for use in planning, implementation, and evaluation of public health practice. Disease surveillance is a critical component of measles control andelimination efforts and is used in the assessment of progress and in making adjustments to programmes as required. Surveillance data are essential for: \u00b7 describing the characteristics of measles cases in order to understand the reasons for the occurrence of the disease and develop appropriate control measures; \u00b7 predicting potential outbreaks and implementing vaccination strategies in order to prevent outbreaks; \u00b7 monitoring progress towards achieving disease control and elimination goals; \u00b7 providing evidence that, in countries with low measles incidence, the absence of reported cases is attributable to the absence of disease rather than toinadequate detection and reporting. Surveillance and its objectives should evolve according to the stage of measles control. The principal uses of data for decision-making are as follows. At the mortality reduction stage: \u00b7 monitoring incidence and coverage in order to assess progress (i.e. decreasing incidence and increasing coverage); \u00b7 identifying areas at high risk or with poor programme performance; \u00b7 describing the changing epidemiology of measles in terms of age, immunization status and the intervals between epidemics.Measles surveillance objectivesModule on best practices for measles surveillance 6At the low incidence or elimination stage: \u00b7 identifying high-risk populations; \u00b7 determining when the next outbreak may occur because of a build-up of susceptible persons, and accelerating activities beforehand; \u00b7 determining where measles virus is circulating or may circulate (i.e. high-risk areas); \u00b7 assessing the performance of the surveillance system (e.g. reaction time for notification, specimen collection) in the detection of virus circulation or potential importation; \u00b7 using performance indicators to identify areas where it is necessary to strengthen surveillance. At both stages: \u00b7 detecting and investigating outbreaks so as to ensure proper case management, and determining why outbreaks have occurred (e.g. failure to vaccinate,vaccine failure, accumulation of susceptible persons). In general, surveillance lags behind vaccination efforts in most programmes for the control of vaccine-preventable diseases. Effective vaccination strategies can quickly reduce disease incidence, whereas establishing a surveillance system takes time and changing surveillance practices is difficult. Countries should therefore develop andfollow long-term measles control strategies providing a surveillance system that can respond to changes in the incidence of the disease. In the interest of improving vaccination systems that aim to control and eliminate measles it is also vital to monitor the cold chain and immunization safety,including injection safety and adverse events following immunization. However, the present document deals exclusively with disease surveillance. Monitoring the accumulation of susceptible persons The aim of a vaccination programme is to reduce the number of susceptibles and to ensure that low levels of susceptibility are maintained thereafter. The susceptibilityprofile describes the distribution of susceptibility to measles within a population. It will vary by age and by population sub-group (e.g., ethnic or social group). Before a new vaccination programme is launched the age specific susceptibility profileshould be established. In particular, vaccination campaigns can only be targeted effectively if the distribution of susceptible individuals in the population is known. There are 3 methods to assess the susceptibility profile of a population, availability of surveillance data is important for the last two methods: \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 Serological surveys. The most direct way to estimate the susceptibility profile is through an age stratified serological survey, interpreting samples negative for measles IgG antibody as susceptible to measles.7 WHO/V&B/01.43\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 Alternative methods using vaccine coverage and incidence data. For a healthcare system with limited resources other methods of estimating the susceptibility profile can be used. These rely upon routine vaccine coverage and case notification data. In populations with little exposure to naturalinfection, the proportion susceptible can be estimated from age-specific data on vaccination status (proportions who have received no dose, one dose only, and two doses) and vaccination effectiveness. \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 Mathematical models. Mathematical models simulate measles transmission in a population and those simulations can be used to determine the susceptibilityprofile. Further information is given in the WHO document \"Measles reduction and regional elimination. Principles for measles control and elimination\" (in press).Module on best practices for measles surveillance 8The functions of measles surveillance are: \u00b7 detecting and reporting cases and outbreaks; \u00b7 collecting, consolidating and interpreting data; \u00b7 investigating and confirming cases and outbreaks; \u00b7 analysing, producing routine reports and interpreting data; \u00b7 feeding data forward to more central levels; \u00b7 providing feedback to more peripheral levels. In these guidelines the enhanced surveillance that is needed and recommended only in countries at the elimination stage is provided in a separate section at the end of this chapter. Figure 1: Measles surveillance flow-chartOperationalizing surveillance Heath care facility (collect specimens in some facilities, investigate and respond) FeedbackReporting Feedback District health office (collect specimens investigate, analyse and respond) FeedbackReporting State or national health office (investigate, analyse, respond)9 WHO/V&B/01.43Measles surveillance systems should: \u00b7 provide the information needed to direct the vaccination system; \u00b7 avoid collecting unnecessary information; \u00b7 be sustainable; \u00b7 allow decisions and responses to be made at the most peripheral level; \u00b7 be part of an integrated disease surveillance system. Detecting and reporting Who detects and reports? Suggested reporting sites are: 1. Hospitals: inpatient and outpatient clinics. 2. Health centres/units/clinics. It is important that private medical practitioners and private hospitals be included in the system, as they may be the first to see suspected measles cases. As the incidence of measles decreases, community sources play an important role in the detection and reporting of cases because the small number of persons affected may not seek health care. These community sources may include pharmacists, traditional healers, village leaders, school personnel, and so on. In countries wherelaboratory testing is common, laboratories can be important reporting sites. Every health facility should designate one person and one or two stand-ins to monitor suspected measles cases and report on them. The mechanisms for reporting should be simple and efficient; if they are not, busy clinicians may not submit reports. Where to report? Reports should be submitted to district or provincial surveillance coordinators.In return, district or provincial staff should promptly report to the state or national surveillance staff. What to report? The use of a sensitive and specific measles case definition is recommended at everylevel so as to standardize reporting and avoid underreporting or reporting non-measles cases as measles cases. WHO recommends the following clinical and laboratorycase definitions of measles. Clinical case definition Any person in whom a clinician suspects measles infection or any person with fever and maculopapular rash (i.e. non-vesicular) and cough, coryza (i.e. runny nose) or conjunctivitis (i.e. red eyes) .Module on best practices for measles surveillance 10Laboratory criteria for diagnosis Presence of measles-specific IgM antibodies. Case classification : Countries are advised to use the clinical classification until their programme meets the following two criteria: \u00b7 low levels of measles incidence has been achieved, and \u00b7 there is access to a proficient measles laboratory. Laboratory and epidemiological confirmation are the best criteria for those countries in the low incidence or elimination phase. Clinical classification : Clinically confirmed: A case that meets the clinical case definition. Discarded: A suspect case that does not meet the clinical case definition. Laboratory classification * Laboratory confirmed: A case that meets the clinical case definition and islaboratory confirmed. Epidemiologically confirmed: A case that meets the clinical case definition and is linked epidemiologically to a laboratory confirmed case. Clinically confirmed: A case that meets the clinical case definition andfor which no adequate blood specimen was taken. Discarded A suspect case that does not meet the clinical or laboratory definition. * Laboratory classification may also be used for outbreak investigations.11 WHO/V&B/01.43The following data are essential for understanding the causes of cases and the effectiveness of the vaccination system: \u00b7 date of occurrence of cases; \u00b7 place of occurrence of cases; \u00b7 age and vaccination status of cases. In addition it is useful to collect information on the vital status of cases. How to report? Case-based reporting may overburden the system and is unnecessary for decision-making in countries where measles is endemic. In these countries thereporting of aggregate data from cases detected during a defined period, e.g. a month, is recommended. Annex 1 is a sample report form for countries where measles is endemic. Copies of this form should be readily available at reporting sites. The reportscan be communicated by mail, fax, courier service or email. In countries where measles is endemic or where elimination is targeted it is recommended that measles surveillance be part of an integrated disease surveillancesystem.Figure 2: Laboratory classification of measles cases using the laboratory scheme IgM negative Discard Adequate blood specimen* IgM positive** Laboratory confirmed SuspectedMeasles Case Epidemiological link to laboratory confirmed caseEpidemiologically confirmed No adequateblood specimen No epidemiological link to laboratory confirmed caseClinically confirmed * While IgM ELISA tests are more sensitive between days 4 and 28 after the onset of rash, a single serum sample obtained at the first contact with the health care system within 28 days after onset is considered adequate for measles surveillance. ** If the case has been vaccinated within 6 weeks prior to serum collection, refer to the Manual for the laboratory diagnosis of measles virus infection, December 1999 (WHO/V&B/00.16). If an active search in the community does not find evidence of measles transmission and there is no history oftravelling to areas where measles virus is known to be circulating then the case should be discarded.Module on best practices for measles surveillance 121Vaccine coverage calculation: it is important to evaluate coverage for all recommended doses of measles vaccination (one-dose and two-dose coverage, depending on the recommended schedule inthe country concerned). For example, using administrative method to calculate first-dose coveragerecommended at 9 months of age, the numerator should be the number of doses administered tochildren at 9-11 months of age and denominator should be the birth cohort corresponding to thesame year as the numerator data. If a second dose is recommended at 4 years of age the numeratorshould be the number of doses administered to children aged 48-59 months and the denominatorshould be the total number of children corresponding to the same birth cohort.When to report? Monthly reporting of cases is recommended where measles is endemic. If, however, there is a sudden increase in the detected number of cases the health authorities atthe more central level should be notified immediately. If monthly reports are provided as part of an integrated disease surveillance system, zero measles cases should also be indicated on the forms used for this purpose. Collecting, consolidating and interpreting data District-level staff should combine and evaluate the data collected from all reporting sites on a monthly basis. The form used for reports from health facilities (Annex 1)can also be used to aggregate data at the district level. After the compilation of district-specific data the form should be sent to the state or national level every month. If possible, data should be entered into a computer at the district or provinciallevel and forwarded to the state or national level for the purpose of analysis. It is important to keep track of and evaluate measles data at the district level (i.e. the most peripheral level). District staff are thus able to assess whether a measlesoutbreak is imminent and how it can be prevented, or whether such an outbreak is continuing and how the spread of the disease can be limited. Will there be an outbreak in the current year? Outbreaks can be predicted and prevented by monitoring the number of susceptibleindividuals and the changing epidemiology of the disease and by vaccinating before an outbreak occurs. Estimates of the current number of susceptible individuals canbe calculated on the basis of: \u00b7 information about vaccination: - the time elapsed since the introduction of measles vaccine; - measles vaccine coverage 1 since the introduction of the vaccine; - the timing of and coverage achieved during supplementary measures such as campaigns; \u00b7 information about the disease: - age-specific incidence; \u00b7 change in population dynamics: - large migration of unvaccinated individuals into the area in question.13 WHO/V&B/01.43Although model-based calculations can be performed in order to estimate when the next measles epidemic is likely to happen, outbreaks can also be predicted in a simple way. In the absence of any major interventions or events (e.g. mass vaccination campaigns, substantial increases in routine vaccination coverage, recent influxes ofrefugees), reviewing the trend of reported cases over time reveals sufficient information. The interval between epidemics increases with the level of immunity in the population. For example, in an area that experiences measles epidemics everythree to four years the timing of the next epidemic can be predicted. To allow for intervention before an outbreak occurs it is recommended that a low estimate is made of the interval between epidemics. If an intervention is planned with a view to preventing an outbreak it should be effected before the measles epidemic season begins. What is an outbreak? The term \"outbreak\" is used when the number of cases observed in a givengeographical area is greater than that normally expected in the area during a given period of time. For this reason it is useful to evaluate trends in recent years(i.e. average numbers of cases or the average incidence rate for a defined geographical area during a defined period of time in non-epidemic years). If previous surveillance data are not available, conversations with local health care workers can provide reliable information about an unusual increase in the occurrence of measles in the past month. An increase in the number of cases may reflect an increase in reporting. For instance, a new doctor assigned to a hospital may be more diligent than a predecessor inreporting cases. During the investigation of an outbreak it is possible to discover whether the observed increase is real or an artefact. An increase may also reflect other diseases, e.g. rubella. If the initial 5-10 samples are negative for measles it isimportant to test them for rubella. Investigating and confirming cases and outbreaks 1. During the endemic period it is not recommended that every suspected case of measles be investigated and confirmed. However, there may be exceptions to this in countries where there is a strong surveillance infrastructure andintegrated case-based disease surveillance. 2. If a measles epidemic affects a wide geographical area or is nationwide, it is recommended that outbreaks be investigated in a few locations, e.g. a ruralarea and an urban area, rather than every outbreak in every town. 3. When an outbreak is suspected (see \"Collecting, consolidating and interpreting data\" above) it is recommended that: - district surveillance staff immediately notify other health facilities in their area and make sure that blood specimens are collected from 5-10 casesfor the purpose of confirmation (Annex 2a); - urine or nasopharyngeal specimens are collected from 5-10 cases, which may be the same ones as those from which blood specimens are collected, for viral isolation and genetic sequencing. (Annex 2a);Module on best practices for measles surveillance 14- a laboratory form is filled in, sent to the laboratory, and copied to the district health office (Annex 2b); - laboratory results are obtained within seven days of submitting the specimens. 4. When the outbreak is confirmed it is important that: - the state or national level is notified immediately; - the collection and analysis of data continue so that the outbreak is monitored and its causes determined (see \"Analysing, producing routine reports, and interpreting data\" below); - appropriate outbreak response takes place (see \"Analysing, producing routine reports, and interpreting data\" below). Analysing, producing routine reports and interpreting data Surveillance data should be analysed: \u00b7 at each level (i.e. health facility, district, state or national) on a monthly basis. Surveillance staff at district health offices should review any areas that do not report cases for extended periods. If there are such areas it is important to identify at least one reporting site, e.g. a hospital or large clinic, and include it in training programmesand prompt reporting procedures. Analyses should be aimed at understanding the reasons for the occurrence of measles, obtaining guidance for control strategies, predicting potential outbreaks in orderto implement vaccination strategies for the prevention of outbreaks, and planningmeasles elimination strategies. A few simple graphs can provide the essential data (i.e. time, place and person): \u00b7 number of cases by month of report comparing two consecutive years (Annex 3a); \u00b7 number of cases reported by health facility (spot map) (Annex 3b); \u00b7 number of cases by age group and vaccination status (cumulative for the year) (Annex 3c); In addition and where information on vital status/deaths are available, analysis of number of deaths by age group and vaccination status (cumulative for the year) is recommended (Annex 3d). Despite complete reporting from all sites it is likely that some measles-related cases or deaths will be undetected by the surveillance system. Some measles deaths may occur at home without health care having been sought, and some cases may recover in the same circumstances. Furthermore, because of the long-term effects of measlesand delayed measles mortality, some measles deaths may be misclassified as attributable to other factors and may not be reported as measles deaths. Finally, cases in which measles is the underlying cause of death rather than the primarycause (e.g. in secondary bacterial pneumonia) may not be reported as attributable to measles. However, these biases do not preclude the need to collect data on measles15 WHO/V&B/01.43deaths and their characteristics. Such data are essential for the measurement of progress towards measles mortality reduction and for targeting appropriate control measures. In order to monitor the impact of the vaccination system over time, surveillance staff should compare data from previous years with current data: \u00b7 number of cases and deaths by year (Annex 4a and 4b); \u00b7 proportion of cases in each age group (Annex 4c); \u00b7 proportion of vaccinated cases (Annex 4d); \u00b7 proportion of fatal cases (i.e. case-fatality ratio = number of measles deaths divided by the total number of cases) (Annex 4e). The calculation of incidence rates, i.e. the number of measles cases divided by the population at risk, is especially useful at the state or national level for comparingthe occurrence of disease at different places and times (Annex 5). In order to calculate rates accurately it is important to obtain accurate population figures. Population data can be obtained from the census bureau or can be assessed by specialsurveys performed by various institutions or by health facilities. However, even if population figures are obtained it may be difficult to determine the area served by reference hospitals. Moreover, it should be borne in mind that variations in measlesincidence rates may reflect variations in reporting. If population data are available, age-specific attack rates, i.e. the number of cases in a specific age group divided by the total number of persons in it, can be calculated to see which age group is at highest risk for measles (Annex 6). During an outbreak In areas with a routine surveillance system, aggregate data routinely collected mayreveal sufficient information about the cause of an outbreak, i.e. whether the outbreak occurred because of vaccine failure, failure to vaccinate, accumulation of susceptible individuals or migration of such individuals, and about how it might have beenprevented. However, if routine surveillance is poor or lacking it is important that data on cases (e.g. time, place and person) be collected and that analyses be performed as indicated above. (For further information, see WHO guidelines for epidemic preparedness and response to measles outbreaks . 2) Examples of data trends and interpretation \u00b7 High proportion of unvaccinated cases: poor vaccination coverage. \u00b7 High proportion of vaccinated cases: high vaccination coverage. Because one dose of measles vaccine does not provide 100% immunity it can be expected that cases will occur among individuals who have received only a single dose.If the number of vaccinated cases is more than expected, or very high, the effectiveness of the vaccine should be evaluated (see below). 2WHO guidelines for epidemic preparedness and response to measles outbreaks (WHO/CDS/CSR/ISR/99.01).Module on best practices for measles surveillance 16\u00b7 High proportion of cases among children aged 1-4 years: poor vaccination coverage. \u00b7 High proportion of cases among children aged 5-9 years: moderate to high one-dose vaccination coverage, increased risk of exposure, e.g. in schools.As vaccination coverage increases, overall incidence decreases and the occurrence of measles cases shifts towards older age groups. \u00b7 High proportion of adult cases: measles contracted by susceptible persons who have never been exposed to measles virus or vaccine, e.g. workers from isolated rural areas who have recently migrated to urban areas. \u00b7 High incidence in certain areas: vaccination coverage is poor or surveillance is better than elsewhere in these areas. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) can be estimated by plotting the percentage of measles cases in vaccinated individuals (PCV) and the percentage of the population vaccinated (PPV) on a graph showing the relationship between PPV , PCV and VE (Figure 3). For instance, if 60% of measles cases are in individuals vaccinated against measlesand if vaccination coverage is 95%, vaccine effectiveness is close to 95%; if 30% of measles cases are in individuals vaccinated against measles and if vaccination coverage is 60%, vaccine effectiveness is about 70%. (See Orenstein et al. for furtherinformation on calculating vaccine effectiveness.)

The response should take place before anoutbreak occurs. Once an outbreak has begun in an area with low vaccination coverage, vaccination efforts are not usually sufficiently rapid and extensive to control it. Consequently, it is critical that outbreaks be predicted and prevented.This means reducing susceptibility by increasing vaccination among populations with low immunity. Outbreak prevention requires not only one-dose coverage to be increased, but also coverage with a second dose provided by a routine vaccinationsystem or by supplemental activities. The following measures should be adopted once an outbreak is confirmed. \u00b7 In the immediate area: - health care workers and the community should be informed at once and continued feedback should be provided; - in all measles outbreaks, the activities of strengthening routine immunization, raising awareness of vaccination and effective case management should be a priority. It is critical to recognize thatsupplementary immunization activities may not have a substantial impact on the course of a measles outbreak; and that even when they are successful, the cost per prevented case can be very high; - persons should be treated according to the case management guidelines. \u00b7 In areas to which the outbreak may spread: - assessments should be made and efforts to improve vaccination coverage should take priority; - data collection and data analysis should continue and/or intensify to detect spread of the outbreak or other changes in the epidemiology of measles. (See WHO guidelines for epidemic preparedness and response to measles outbreaks for further information on outbreak response.) Feeding data forward to more central levels The reporting of data to more central levels was discussed above in the section entitled\"Detecting and reporting\". It is also important to report to staff at the central levels on various surveillance issues at the peripheral levels, possibly including: \u00b7 needs of the surveillance system at the peripheral levels; if the central levels have the responsibility of providing equipment, gasoline, training materials, etc., the peripheral levels should inform central level staff in good time; \u00b7 feedback from central levels; if staff at the peripheral level are not receiving feedback from central levels or if any corrections need to be made to the datapresented in feedback, peripheral surveillance staff should inform central levelstaff accordingly.Module on best practices for measles surveillance 18Providing feedback to more peripheral levels The provision of feedback to more peripheral levels helps the surveillance system at every level by: \u00b7 informing health care workers about current measles epidemiology, recommended measles vaccination and surveillance activities and their effectiveness; \u00b7 creating a collaborative environment by acknowledging the hard work of data providers and making them aware that their data are being analysed; \u00b7 verifying with the peripheral levels that the data received at more central levels are correct; \u00b7 improving performance by showing national progress towards specific public health goals and making comparisons between regions, provinces, etc. The following table provides some suggestions for feedback procedures.

Weekly feedback may be necessary in countries with elimination goals.19 WHO/V&B/01.43Enhanced surveillance for countries at the low incidence or elimination stage Detecting and reporting Case-based reporting and laboratory confirmation of every suspected case is fundamental for monitoring measles virus during the elimination phase. To determine whether measles cases are due to indigenous or imported virus, a small number of samples from each chain of transmission should be collected for virus isolation andgenetic analysis. It is recommended that weekly reporting be established, including zero-reporting when no cases are detected. It is advisable to provide a specific form for this purpose(Annex 7). The form used for weekly reporting of acute flaccid paralysis can be expanded for the reporting of measles and other diseases. It is important that reports of zero cases genuinely reflect the absence of suspected cases in the communitiesconcerned. In-depth investigation of each suspected case is critical. In addition to reporting the case, it should be the responsibility of the clinician to collect blood and urine ornasopharyngeal samples at the time of examination of the patient, as some cases may be lost to follow-up after the first contact. Establishing a special \"hot line\" is recommended to convey information by the fastest means possible (telephone, telegram, aerogram, fax, email, etc.). A suspected case should be reported to the district within 24-48 hours of detection. Districts should report to the state or national level within 24-48 hours of confirmation. Collecting, consolidating and interpreting data To prevent the occurrence of outbreaks, it is critical to monitor: \u00b7 the accumulation of susceptible individuals; \u00b7 pockets of unvaccinated populations. At the elimination stage a single laboratory-confirmed measles case constitutes an outbreak.Module on best practices for measles surveillance 20Investigating and confirming cases and outbreaks A single suspected case of measles requires immediate investigation. The health care provider should: \u00b7 make every effort to obtain the basic information, clinical data, a blood sample and a urine or nasopharyngeal sample during the first contact, as it may be the only contact with the patient; it is therefore important to have case investigation forms (Annex 8) distributed to health facilities in advance and for them to beavailable at the time of contact with the patient; \u00b7 inform the patient or parent of the patient that a public health nurse will visit her or his home and explain about measles elimination and why the visit isnecessary. The district health officer should : \u00b7 visit the family immediately with measles investigation forms, measles vaccine and a specimen collection kit; \u00b7 complete the case investigation form and determine whether the case meets the clinical case definition for measles. It is important to evaluate the presence,date and duration of symptoms (fever, non-vesicular rash, cough, coryza, conjunctivitis); \u00b7 initiate an active search for other cases in adjacent homes or in the neighbourhood and complete the active search form (Annex 9) if the case meets the clinical case definition for measles or if there is not enough information to resolve this matter, e.g. if the patient cannot be found; \u00b7 advise all families to keep the patient at home and to keep the number of visitors to a minimum until the rash disappears; \u00b7 ask the family if they know where the patient contracted the illness, and whether exposure to other persons with rash occurred about ten days before the onset of rash in the patient; note, however, that the patient may have been exposed to a person without rash but in the incubation period and infectious; informationshould be sought on whether the patient had travelled outside her/his area of residence; \u00b7 visit homes up to 1000 metres away from the case or in the same block or neighbourhood and ask whether any cases of rash and fever have occurred during the previous month, and check the vaccination status of all children under 15 years of age living in the households; \u00b7 investigate any reports of either illnesses involving rash or general fever and colds. It may be necessary to request that staff from other clinics go to thehomes of possible sources to see if there has been an illness involving rash and to investigate cases fully; \u00b7 visit preschools, nurseries, schools, etc. in the area to find out if any fever and illnesses involving rash have been occurring;21 WHO/V&B/01.43\u00b7 immunize all children in the target age group in those neighbouring areas where the outbreak is most likely to spread (e.g. all susceptible children in nearby villages) who have not received two doses of measles vaccine. An age range (e.g. 6 months to 14 years) may be selected for this vaccination activity,depending on the epidemiology of measles in the area; \u00b7 notify the neighbourhood and schools about the occurrence of the measles case in the area and ask that all persons who have not received two doses ofmeasles vaccine be vaccinated; \u00b7 perform an active search for cases in health facilities in the area; \u00b7 inform local private doctors, laboratories, pharmacies, traditional healers, etc., about the measles case and ask if rash and fever cases have been seen. Monitoring the size and duration of outbreaks to determine elimination status Elimination is the situation where sustained transmission cannot occur and secondary spread from importations of disease will end naturally without intervention.This situation exists when the effective reproductive number (R) is less then one. When R is more than one, there will be an epidemic. The status of measles elimination (R<1) and an estimate of R can be determined from three indicators: \u00b7 the proportion of cases that are imported; \u00b7 the distribution of outbreak sizes; \u00b7 the number of generations of spread in an outbreak. Thus it is critical to: \u00b7 detect all suspected measles cases; \u00b7 laboratory confirm suspect cases; \u00b7 determine their origin of infection; \u00b7 link cases in chains of transmission . Thus it is possible to estimate the R value (see figure 4) from: \u00b7 the distribution of outbreak size (larger than 3 cases); \u00b7 the distribution of outbreak duration by number generations.Module on best practices for measles surveillance 22Generations of spread0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90%100% 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 R 0123-4 5-9 10+ Distribution of outbreak size for outbreaks with at least 3 cases 3-45-910-24 25-99 100-999 1.00 RFigure 4: Theoretical distribution of outbreak sizes and generations of spread according to effective reproduction number23 WHO/V&B/01.43Rubella surveillance and diagnosis Countries that have introduced routine rubella vaccination should integrate rubella surveillance with their case-based surveillance for measles. Other virusescausing febrile rash illnesses may be incorporated into this surveillance system (e.g. dengue, parvovirus B19). Countries in the elimination phase with successful measles immunization programmes may find that a high percentage of suspected measles cases are due to rubella.As measles and rubella may be coincidentally eliminated with use of MMR vaccine, testing negative measles serum samples for rubella will provide useful information for rubella surveillance. The following algorithm will guide laboratory testing procedures and classification of cases for sera collected from suspected measles cases.

They should be assessed periodically, feedback should be given to the health care providers, and any interventions necessaryfor improving the system should be effected. Performance indicators in the control stage for countries where measles is endemic Target : all indicators to be >80% \u00b7 % of districts reporting monthly; \u00b7 % of districts reporting within a month after the report period; \u00b7 % of reported cases containing core data (i.e. age, vaccination status). These indicators should be evaluated at least monthly. In countries where weekly reporting is established, weekly evaluation of indicators may be preferred. For countries at the low incidence or elimination stage, the following performance indicators should be evaluated on a weekly basis. Performance indicators : Target : all indicators to be >80% % of sites reporting weekly % of cases* notified within <48 hours of onset of rash % of cases investigated within <48 hours of notification % of cases with adequate specimen** and laboratory results within 7 days% of confirmed cases with sources of infection identifiedIn order to understand the areas requiring improvement in a surveillance system it may be necessary to conduct an initial evaluation.

More immunization strategies and cases of suspected may be collected in spread newly infected districtsAnnex 2a: Collection, storage and shipment of specimens for measles diagnosis and outbreak investigation31 WHO/V&B/01.43While IgM ELISA tests are more sensitive between days 4 and 28 after the onset of rash, a single serum sample obtained at the first contact with the health care system within 28 days after onset is considered adequate for measles surveillance . Second blood samples These may occasionally be required under the following circumstances: \u00b7 The measles IgM ELISA gives an equivocal result \u00b7 The clinician needs to make a definitive diagnosis on an individual patient with an initial negative result A second sample for IgM testing may be collected anytime between 4 and 28 days after rash onset. Collection of a second sample 10 - 20 days after the first will permit the laboratory to retest for IgM or, if a quantitative method is available, test for an increase in IgG antibody level. This, however, is not recommended on a regularbasis since additional information obtained will be limited. Collection procedures \u00b7 Collect 5 ml blood by venepuncture in a sterile tube labelled with patient identification and collection date \u00b7 Whole blood should be centrifuged at 1000g for 10 minutes to separate the serum. \u00b7 Blood can be stored at 4-8\u00b0C for up to 24 hours before the serum is separated. \u00b7 Do not freeze whole blood. \u00b7 If there is no centrifuge the blood should be kept in a refrigerator until there is complete retraction of the clot from the serum. \u00b7 Carefully remove the serum, avoid extracting red cells, and transfer aseptically to a sterile labelled vial. \u00b7 Label the vial with the patient's name or identifier, date of collection and specimen type. \u00b7 Store the serum at 4-8\u00b0C until shipment takes place. \u00b7 Fill in case investigation forms completely (Annex 2b and, in the elimination phase, Annex 8). Three dates are very important: - date of last measles vaccination; - date of onset of rash; - date of collection of sample.Serological specimens for measles diagnosis Timing of single blood specimen sampling for IgM serology The correct timing of sampling with respect to the clinical signs is important for interpreting results and arriving at an accurate conclusion.Module on best practices for measles surveillance 32\u00b7 Sterile serum should be shipped on wet ice within 48 hours or stored at 4-8\u00b0C for a maximum period of 7 days. \u00b7 Sera must be frozen at -20\u00b0C for longer periods and transported to the testing laboratory on frozen ice packs. Repeated freezing and thawing can havedetrimental effects on the stability of IgM antibodies. Shipment of blood specimens \u00b7 Specimens should be shipped to the laboratory as soon as possible. Do not wait to collect additional specimens before shipping. \u00b7 Place specimens in Ziplock or plastic bags. \u00b7 Use Styrofoam boxes or a Thermos flask. \u00b7 For each specimen, place the specimen form and the investigation form in a plastic bag and tape to the inner surface of the top of a Styrofoam box. \u00b7 If using ice packs, which should be frozen, place them at the bottom of the box and along the sides, place the samples in the centre, and place more ice packson top. \u00b7 Arrange a shipping date. \u00b7 When the arrangements have been finalized, inform the receiver of the time and manner of transportation. \u00b7 More details on how to package and ship samples are given in the Manual for laboratory diagnosis of measles virus infection . Urine for measles virus isolation Samples of between 10 and 50 ml urine are adequate for this purpose. It is preferable to obtain the first urine passed in the morning. Most of the measles virus excreted in urine samples is located in epithelial cells. The virus is concentrated by centrifugationof the urine and resuspension of the pelleted cells in a suitable viral transport medium. Urine should NOT be frozen before the concentration procedure is carried out. Timing The isolation of measles virus is most successful if the specimens are collected assoon as possible after the onset of rash and at least within 7 days after onset.Storage of blood specimens \u00b7 Whole blood may be held at refrigerator temperatures (4-8\u00b0C) if it can be transported to the testing laboratory within 24 hours. \u00b7 If the latter step is not possible the tube must be centrifuged to separate the serum, which is transferred to a sterile labelled screw-capped tube for transportation to the laboratory. \u00b7 If no centrifuge is available the blood is held in a refrigerator for 24 hours for clot retraction. The serum is then carefully removed with a fine-bore pipette and transferred to a sterile tube.33 WHO/V&B/01.43Collection procedure \u00b7 The urine should be collected in a sterile container. \u00b7 It should be placed at 4 -8\u00b0C before centrifugation. \u00b7 Centrifugation should be performed within a few hours (see below). Storage and shipment of urine samples \u00b7 Whole urine samples may be shipped in well-sealed containers at 4\u00b0C but centrifugation within 24 hours after collection is preferable. \u00b7 Centrifugation should be performed at 500g (approximately 1500 rpm) and 4\u00b0C for 5 minutes. \u00b7 The supernatant should be discarded and the sediment resuspended in 1ml viral transport medium or tissue culture medium. \u00b7 DO NOT FREEZE the sediment if shipment is possible within 48 hours and DO NOT FREEZE urine before the concentration procedure is carried out. \u00b7 The resuspended pellet may be stored at 4\u00b0C and shipped within 48 hours to a measles reference laboratory. Alternatively, it may be frozen at -70\u00b0C in viraltransport medium and shipped on dry ice in a well-sealed screw-capped vial toprotect against CO2 contamination. Nasopharyngeal specimens for measles virus isolation Timing Nasopharyngeal specimens for virus isolation must be collected as soon as possible after onset and not longer than 7 days after the appearance of the rash, when the virus is present in high concentration. Collection procedures Nasopharyngeal specimens can be taken as follows (in order of increasing yield ofvirus): \u00b7 aspiration; \u00b7 lavage; \u00b7 swabbing the mucous membranes. Nasal aspirates are collected by introducing a few ml of sterile saline into the nose with a syringe fitted with fine rubber tubing and collecting the fluid in ascrew-capped centrifuge tube containing viral transport medium 3 (see Manual for laboratory diagnosis of measles virus infection, December 1999 (WHO/V&B/00.16). 3If viral transport medium is not available, isotonic saline solution, tissue culture medium or phosphate-buffered saline may be used.Module on best practices for measles surveillance 34Throat washes are obtained by asking the subject to gargle with a small volume of sterile saline and collecting the fluid in viral transport medium. Nasopharyngeal swabs are obtained by firmly rubbing the nasopharyngeal passage and throat with sterile cotton swabs to dislodge epithelial cells. The swabs are placedin sterile viral transport medium * in labelled screw-capped tubes, refrigerated and transported to the laboratory on wet ice (4-8\u00b0C) within 48 hours. Storage and transport of nasopharyngeal specimens \u00b7 Nasopharyngeal specimens should be transported in viral transport medium* and shipped on wet ice (4-8\u00b0C), and should arrive at the testing laboratory within 48 hours. \u00b7 If arrangements cannot be made for rapid shipment, swabs should be shaken in the medium to elute the cells and then removed. \u00b7 The medium or nasal aspirate should be centrifuged at 500g approximately 1500 rpm) and 4\u00b0C for 5 minutes and the resulting pellet should be resuspended in cell culture medium. \u00b7 The suspended pellet and the supernatant are stored separately at -70\u00b0C and shipped to the testing laboratory on dry ice in well-sealed screw-capped vialsto protect against CO 2 contamination. NOTE: Samples for virus isolationThe laboratory should agree in advance with the epidemiologists on the number, type and locations that are most appropriate for collection of samples for virus isolation. Ideally, the samples for virus isolation should be collectedsimultaneously with the blood samples for serological diagnosis and confirmation of measles virus as the cause of the outbreak. Since each type of sample has different requirements the decision on the type of samplesdepends on the local resources and facilities for transportation and storage. Because virus is more likely to be isolated when specimens are collected within three days of the onset of rash, the collection of specimens for virus isolationshould not be delayed until laboratory confirmation of a suspected case of measles is obtained. Specimen kit for measles diagnosis The components required in a specimen collection kit for measles diagnosis havebeen laid down. They are suitable for distribution to facilities collecting samples from suspected cases in countries at the stage of measles elimination.35 WHO/V&B/01.43The basic kit for blood collection consists of: \u00b7 a 5-ml vacutainer tube (non-heparinized) with a 23 gauge needle; \u00b7 a tourniquet; \u00b7 sterilizing swabs; \u00b7 serum storage vials; \u00b7 specimen labels; \u00b7 band aid; \u00b7 Ziplock plastic bags; \u00b7 specimen referral form; \u00b7 cold box with ice packs. Interpreting laboratory results Final classification of suspected measles cases for countries in the Measles elimination phase \u00b7 Only patients that have a positive result with a validated IgM ELISA assay are considered to be laboratory confirmed measles cases. \u00b7 Patients with assays results obtained by other methods are considered as suspected pending final laboratory testing. If for any reason, an approved IgM ELISA is not performed on samples positive by other methods, these cases, for surveillance purposes, are considered as \"clinically confirmed\" measles cases. Interpretation of results in recently vaccinated patients Natural measles infection and measles vaccine can stimulate an IgM response in the host. If the suspected case has been vaccinated within six weeks before the onset of rash the interpretation of the results may be problematic because: \u00b7 measles vaccine can cause fever in 5% and rash in approximately 20% of vaccinees; \u00b7 first-time vaccinees are expected to have detectable measles IgM after vaccination; \u00b7 a mild rash lasting one to three days may occur approximately a week after vaccination; \u00b7 serological techniques cannot distinguish between the immune responses to natural infection and immunization; this can only be accomplished by viralisolation and characterization. \u00b7 other medical conditions, e.g. rubella and dengue, can cause rash and fever in persons who have recently received measles vaccine. Consequently, an operational definition is required to facilitate the final classification of suspected measles cases with an IgM-positive result.Module on best practices for measles surveillance 36Classification of cases with IgM-positive result and recent history of measles vaccination Final classification Vaccination history Epidemiological findings Discarded History of measles Active search in community does not reveal evidence of vaccination within six weeks measles transmission. before onset of rash No history of travelling to areas where measles virus is known to be circulating Confirmed History of measles Active search in community reveals other laboratory- vaccination within six weeks confirmed measles cases before onset of rash Most of Annex 2a has been taken from the Manual for laboratory diagnosis of measles virus infection.37 WHO/V&B/01.43Annex 2b: Measles laboratory request and result form Measles laboratory request and result form Country: Patient number: Date / / Patient name: MF Date of birth / / Age in months: Name of parent or guardian: Address: Number of doses of measles vaccine: Date of last dose / / Date of onset of fever / / Date of onset of rash / / Type of rash: Provisional clinical diagnosis: Specimen Date of collection Date of shipment (1) / / / / (2) / / / / (3) / / / / Name of person to whom laboratory results should be sent: Address: Telephone number: Fax number: For use by the receiving laboratory: Name of laboratory: Name of person receiving the specimen: Specimen condition: Specimen Date received Date of result Type of test Test result Comment in laboratory / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / /Module on best practices for measles surveillance 38Annex 3a: Number of measles cases and deaths reported by month (Place, year 1 and year 2) Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Month of report Year 1 /i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0Year 239 WHO/V&B/01.43Annex 3b: Spot map of measles cases (Place, year 2) Capital CityCityCity City Note: Areas with no measles cases may indicate poor surveillance and lack of reporting.\u007f= 1 caseModule on best practices for measles surveillance 40Annex 3c: Number of measles cases by age groupNot vaccinated Vaccinated-history /i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0Vaccinated-record Unknown Note: Adult age groups can be grouped together if few cases are occurring in these groupsNumber of cases41 WHO/V&B/01.43Annex 3d: Number of measles deaths by group vaccination status (Place, January-June, year) 05101520 <1 yr 1-4 20-24 yr groupNumber of deaths Not vaccinated Vaccinated-history /i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0Vaccinated-record on for measles surveillance of measles cases by year (Place, 1994-2000*) 02004006008001000 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 YearNumber of cases * The number of years can be expanded depending on the availability of data and objectives of analysis.43 WHO/V&B/01.43Annex 4b: Number of measles deaths by year (Place, 1994-2000*) 020406080100 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 YearNumber of deaths * The number of years can be expanded depending on the availability of data and objectives of analysis.Module on best practices for measles surveillance 44Annex 4c: Proportion of measles cases by age Year15-19 yr 20-24 yr 25+ yr <1 yr 1-4 yr 10-14 yr * The number of years can be expanded depending on the availability of data and objectives of analysis.45 WHO/V&B/01.43Annex 4d: Proportion of measles cases by 2000 YearProportion (%) Not vaccinated Vaccinated-history /i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0 Vaccinated-record Unknown * The number of years can be expanded depending on the availability of data and objectives of analysis.Module on best practices for measles surveillance 46Annex 4e: Proportion of measles cases 1998 1999 2000 YearProportion (%) Death /i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0 No death * The number of years can be expanded depending on the availability of data and objectives of analysis.47 WHO/V&B/01.43Annex 5: Incidence rate by district (State, January to June, year) Name of Population Number of Incidence rate district cases (per 1000) A 50 000 50 1.0 B 20 000 25 1.3 C 10 000 100 10.0 D 60 000 30 0.5 E 100 000 1 500 15.0 F 10 000 10 1.0 G 15 000 50 3.3 Total 265 000 1 765 6.7Module on best practices for measles surveillance 48Age group Population Number of Attack rate (years) cases (per 1000) A 50 000 50 1.0 <1 11 141 181 16.2 1-4 44 521 299 6.7 5-9 55 462 121 2.2 10-14 55 328 99 1.8 15-19 55 256 30 0.5 20-24 61 512 4 0.1 25+ 310 652 4 0.0 Total 593 872 738 1.2 NB: If possible in the context of integrated surveillance it is suggested that the following age groups below 5 years be used: 0-5 months, 6-11 months, 12-23 months,2-4 years. This would give more specific information on how to adjust programmes. The denominator can be further refined to include only the population at risk (excluding those already vaccinated or who had suffered from measles previously). This may give a more accurate attack rate among the susceptiblepopulation.
