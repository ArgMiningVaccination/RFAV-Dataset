In the century since then, scientists have made remarkable strides in understanding how Alzheimer's affects the brain and learning how to make life better for affected individuals and families. Below are some important milestones in our progress, including the founding of the Alzheimer's Association in 1980, which has played a key role in advancing research and raising awareness of the disease. [1906-1960: First national agenda](#2010-2019) 1906-1960: First discovery 1906 Dr. Alois Alzheimer first describes \"a peculiar disease\" German physician Alois Alzheimer, a pioneer in linking symptoms to microscopic brain changes, describes the haunting case of Auguste D., a patient who had profound memory loss, unfounded suspicions about her family, and other worsening psychological changes. In her brain at autopsy, he saw dramatic shrinkage and abnormal deposits in and around nerve cells. Dr. Alzheimer died in 1915, never suspecting that his encounter with Auguste D. would one day touch the lives of millions and ignite a massive international research effort. Scientists recognize Dr. Alzheimer not only for his groundbreaking characterization of a major disease but also as a role model. He set a new standard for understanding neurodegenerative disorders by establishing a close clinical relationship with his patients and using new scientific tools to determine how symptoms related to physical brain changes. 1910 Alzheimer's disease named Emil Kraepelin, a German psychiatrist who worked with Dr. Alzheimer, first names \"Alzheimer's Disease\" in the eighth edition of his book Psychiatrie. 1931 Invention of electron microscope allows further study of brain In 1931, Germans Max Knoll and Ernst Ruska co-invent the electron microscope, which can magnify up to 1 million times. It is not until after WWII that the electron microscope becomes common in major research settings, enabling scientists to study brain cells in more detail. 1968 Development of cognitive measurement scales Researchers develop the first validated measurement scale for assessing cognitive and functional decline in older adults, paving the way to correlate the level of measured impairment with estimates of the number of brain lesions and the volume of damaged tissue. 1970-1979: Modern Research Era 1974 Founding of National Institute on Aging An act of Congress establishes the National Institute on Aging (NIA) as one of our National Institutes of Health (NIH). The NIA is our primary federal agency supporting Alzheimer's research. 1976 Alzheimer's recognized as most common form of dementia Neurologist Robert Katzman identifies Alzheimer's disease as the most common cause of dementia and a major public health challenge in his editorial published in Archives of Neurology. 1980-1989: Awareness and momentum 1980 Alzheimer's Association founded In 1979, Jerome H. Stone and representatives from several family support groups met with the National Institute on Aging to explore the value of a national, independent, nonprofit organization to complement and stimulate federal efforts on Alzheimer's disease. That meeting resulted in the 1980 formation of the Alzheimer's Association with Mr. Stone as founding president. Today, the Alzheimer's Association is the leading voluntary health organization in Alzheimer's care, support and research. 1983 Declaration of National Alzheimer's Disease Month Awareness of Alzheimer's disease increases, leading Congress to designate November 1983 as the first National Alzheimer's Disease Month. 1984 Beta-amyloid identified Researchers George Glenner and Cai'ne Wong report identification of \"a novel cerebrovascular amyloid protein,\" known as beta-amyloid \u2014 the chief component of Alzheimer's brain plaques and a prime suspect in triggering nerve cell damage. 1984 Nationwide infrastructure for Alzheimer's research established The NIA begins funding its network of Alzheimer's Disease Centers at flagship medical institutions, establishing a nationwide infrastructure for research, diagnosis and treatment. 1986 Tau protein identified Researchers discover that tau protein is a key component of tangles \u2014 the second pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease and another prime suspect in nerve cell degeneration. 1987 First Alzheimer's drug trial The Alzheimer's Association assists the NIA and Warner-Lambert Pharmaceutical Company (now Pfizer) in launching and recruiting participants for clinical trials of tacrine, the first drug specifically targeting symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. 1987 First deterministic Alzheimer's gene identified Researchers identify the first gene associated with rare, inherited forms of Alzheimer's disease. This gene on chromosome 21 codes amyloid precursor protein (APP), the parent molecule from which beta-amyloid is formed. Chromosome 21 is also the chromosome of which those with Down syndrome have three copies rather than two. Many individuals with Down syndrome develop Alzheimer's disease, often as young as their 30s and 40s. 1990-1999: Treatments emerge 1991 Federal clinical study consortium launched The NIA established the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS), a nationwide medical network to facilitate clinical research and conduct federally funded clinical trials. 1993 First Alzheimer's risk factor gene identified Researchers identify APOE-e4, a form of the apolipoprotein-E (APOE) gene on chromosome 19, as the first gene that raises risk for Alzheimer's but does not determine that a person who has it will develop the disease. 1993 First Alzheimer's drug approved by FDA The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves tacrine (Cognex) as the first drug specifically targeting Alzheimer's memory and thinking symptoms. Four additional drugs are approved over the next 10 years. 1994 President Reagan's diagnosis announced Former U.S. President Ronald Reagan shares with the American people that he has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. In an open letter to the American people about his decision to share his diagnosis, President Reagan wrote, \"In opening our hearts, we hope this might promote greater awareness of this condition. Perhaps it will encourage a clearer understanding of the individuals and families who are affected by it.\" 1994 First World Alzheimer's Day The first World Alzheimer's Day (WAD) launches on September 21 by Alzheimer's Disease International, the umbrella organization of Alzheimer's associations. 1995 First transgenic mouse model announced Researchers announce the first transgenic mouse model that developed Alzheimer-like brain pathology. The mouse was developed by inserting one of the human APP genes linked to a rare, inherited form of Alzheimer's disease. The Alzheimer's Association first awarded a grant to develop a mouse model of a rare neurodegenerative disorder called Gerstmann-Str\u00e4ussler-Scheinker syndrome in 1989, laying the technical foundation for Alzheimer's mouse models. 1999 \"Alzheimer's vaccine\" successful in mice The first in a series of reports is published showing that injecting transgenic \"Alzheimer\" mice with beta-amyloid prevents the animals from developing plaques and other Alzheimer-like brain changes. 2000-2009: Progress and hope 2003 National Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Study begins The Alzheimer's Association partners with the National Institute on Aging to recruit participants for the National Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Study, a federal initiative to collect and bank blood samples from families with several members who developed Alzheimer's disease late in life in order to identify additional Alzheimer's risk genes. 2004 First report on Pittsburgh Compound B (PIB) Researchers at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference on Alzheimer's Disease (AAICAD) share their first report on an imaging agent called Pittsburgh Compound B (PIB), a major potential breakthrough in disease monitoring and early detection. PIB enters the brain through the bloodstream and attaches itself to beta-amyloid deposits, where it can be detected by positron emission tomography (PET). The Alzheimer's Association provided significant support to initiatives to develop PIB and conduct preclinical testing it in animal studies. 2004 Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) The Alzheimer's Association joins public and private donors as a major sponsor of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), a nationwide study to establish standards for obtaining and interpreting brain images. The ultimate goal of ADNI is to determine whether standardized images, possibly combined with laboratory and psychological tests, can identify high-risk individuals; provide early detection; and track and monitor treatment effects, especially in clinical trials of disease-modifying drugs. In 2006, the Association launched the European Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (E-ADNI), to expand ADNI's scope by combining data from several European brain imaging initiatives with ADNI data. This effort has now grown into World Wide ADNI (WW-ADNI), a global network of flagship research sites united in a common effort to improve diagnosis and speed treatment development with standardized protocols and data shared internationally. 2005 The Alzheimer's Association launches Alzheimer's & Dementia\u00ae: The Journal of the Alzheimer's Association to further support a global, interdisciplinary exchange within the Alzheimer's research community.

[Read More](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01760005) 2013 Hundreds of researchers from around the world collaborate to perform a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies intended to identify genetic variations linked with an increased risk for Alzheimer's disease. The collaboration revealed 20 genetic variations associated with increased risk, 11 of which had not been linked with Alzheimer's before. Some of the newly identified genetic variations are thought to be specific to the immune system, adding to mounting evidence of a role for the immune system in Alzheimer's disease.
