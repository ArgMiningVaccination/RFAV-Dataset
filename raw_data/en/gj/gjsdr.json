In 2000, DOE contracted with The University of Iowa College of Public Health to coordinate and implement FWP screenings for those who formerly worked at the DOE -facility at the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant (IAAP ). Since Love Canal in the 1970s, there has been extensive documentation of the psychological responses and stress reactions worldwide among those exposed to hazardous substances. Characteristics of Toxic Exposures Stressors Specific to Toxic Exposures that Contribute to Chronic Stress2, 3, 4, 5, 6 Symptoms of Chronic Stress: cognitive, emotional, behavioral, physiological reactions Psychological Conditions Resulting from Toxic Exposures2, 5, 6, 7, 8 Methods Results Psychological Stress Effects of Toxic Exposures Physical symptoms of stress (HTN, elevated hormone levels, impaired immune function) Chronic worry Anger Anxiety/Clinical depression PTSD The IAAP is a 19,000 acre facility near Burlington, Iowa. Since 1943, the IAAP has housed a large Department of Defense conventional weapons and explosives manufacturing facility (Division A) with over 30,000 employees. Today, the IAAP is still in operation manufacturing conventional weapons with about 6 00 employees. From 1949 -1975, the IAAP had a previously secret nuclear weapon assembly plant known as Line 1/Division B/Burlington AEC Plant (BAECP ) with approximately 5,000 employees. From 1949 -1951, BAECP was the only large scale manufacturer of nuclear weapons in the country. In 1975, the nuclear weapons production moved to the Pantex Plant in Amarillo, Texas . Iowa Army Ammunition Plant (IAAP) The Line 1/Division B workers assembled, disassembled , modified and tested nuclear weapons components during the Cold War period and conducted high explosives research to assist in the development of atomic weapons. Workers were exposed to many toxic substances: ionizing radiation, high explosives, solvents, beryllium, uranium, plutonium, asbestos, isocyanates , epoxy adhesives and curing agents. These toxic exposures can lead to a variety of occupational lung diseases and cancers. Learning about or revisiting exposures years later could elicit worry , uncertainty, anger, shock, betrayal & fear , which may increase the risk for developing non - clinical stress reactions such as generalized anxiety, depression & traumatic stress. Conversely, the process of learning about past exposures could be healing. Line 1 Work & Stressors Result from human activities Invisible effects & damage (contamination & health effects) Occur over many years Long -term uncertainty Persistent stressors Lack of control due to human error Undefinable low point Chronic perception of possible threats to health & safety Persistent fear of threats Uncertainty: invisible nature of exposure, possible latent health effects Feelings of loss of control over the present & future Isolation and stigmatism Community conflict/faction: assigning blame, actions to take Economic losses; decline in property value Frustration over the lengthy clean -up process Confusion over highly technical information Dealing with government agencies Insufficient medical & psychological services, especially health care professionals trained in environmental health/toxic exposures Thinking Poor concentration Short attention span Memory problems Decision -making conflicts Slow thinking Can't see alternatives Confusion Feelings Irritability Anger Anxiety Depression Mood swings Agitation Insecurity Apprehension Behavior Impulsiveness Inactivity Dependency Agitated movement Arguing Fighting Reduced productivity Poor task performance Sleep disturbances Increased sick days Loss of control Marital stress Increased substance abuse & alcohol consumption Social isolation Social conflict Demoralization in community As of July 1, 2011, 1,249 Line 1 former workers completed the 'Distress In Relation to Work' Scale as a part of the self -administered Health & Occupational History Questionnaire in conjunction with their medical screening. The 'Distress In Relation to Work' Scale consists of seven items tapping into bothersome feelings/difficulties during the past year regarding sleep, anger, irritability, trouble concentrating, feeling down, effects on social activities and reminders of work at IAAP. 93 % answered all seven distress items. The frequency of each item is rated on a three point scale: never (0), little of the time (1) or most of the time (2). Each participants' non -missing response items were averaged and then multiplied by seven to obtain a standardized distress score, ranging from 0 to 14. Cronbach's alpha (based only on non -missing values) was 0.89, indicating that each item's contribution to the overall distress score is relatively equivalent. Results Table 1.

The average distress scale score was 3.13 (SD=3.53) and the mode was 0 (38%); thus, 62% had a distress scale score ranging from 1 to 14 . Females had a greater mean distress score (3.52) compared to males (3.19) . A greater proportion of females experienced four distress symptoms compared to males (Downhearted and blue: 43% females, 38% males; males) . Whereas a similar proportion of males and females experienced three distress symptoms (~26% health interfered with social activities; ~40% felt irritable/angry; ~38% had trouble concentrating ). Furtherm ore, females may experience trouble falling asleep and reminders of work that cause physical reactions at a higher rate than males (Fisher's exact p=0.0776; C -A respectively) . A possible explanation for these findings is that many women worked as explosive operators and inspectors at the IAAP and were almost twice as likely (61%) to be working in the highest exposure areas to high explosives than men (35%). Also in the general population, women, African -Americans and Hispanic -Americans have higher rates of PTSD than men and European -Americans9,10,11 and women are more likely than men to have anxiety and depression12. Previous studies have found that women are more likely to experience psychosocial impacts from concerns of toxic exposures13,14 and also have a greater perception of threat and risk from nuclear accidents15,16,17 . The mean distress scale scores for African -Americans (5.35) and Hispanics (5.01) were higher than for whites (3.37) ; and the African - Americans' mean distress scale score (5.35, p=0.0034) was statistically significantly higher than for whites (3.37) . There were no statistically significant differences in exposure strata among ethnic groups. African -American and Hispanic workers had statically significantly higher rates of five distress items (Table 4). Age and duration of employment were associated (Pearson correlation coefficient=0.30157, p<0.0001; Spearman rank correlation coefficient=0.30598, p<0.0001). Age was also statistically significantly different with five distress items (Table 4) but was not significantly associated with the distress scale score. Women who worked longer on Line 1 had trouble staying asleep (Fisher's exact p=0.0703, JT p=0.0360) . There were no other statically significant associations between duration of employment and the distress items and distress scale score , even when controlling for age. The mean distress scale scores were statistically significantly higher for those who had jobs with frequent, direct exposure to high explosives (3.76) compared to those who had jobs with no and rare/low exposure to high explosives (2.73 , p<0.0001 and 3.01, p=0.0094 respectively ). All seven distress items were significantly different among the exposure strata; and those working the higher exposure areas to high explosives experienced all seven distress items more often than those working in the lower exposure areas (Table 3). More likely to cause long -term psychological distress than natural disasters1 Implications Several decades after working in the manufacture of nuclear weapons, Line 1 former workers experience symptoms of distress which may be part of a sequela of anxieties regarding unknown health risks and working in an environment of national security and secrecy, including a previous prohibition of discussing potential exposures and suspected health effects. The FWP has provided a venue for former workers to raise concerns regarding effects of their work and exposures on their and their coworkers' health, which for many has been a part of the healing process. In addition, the medical screenings and energy employee's compensation program may increase a sense of trust in government agencies. It is important for health care professionals to be aware of and recognize potential psychological disorders in former nuclear weapons workers and the management of their emotional condition. Former workers' concerns are addressed by effective health risk communication, medical screenings to detect long -term adverse health effects of employment in the nuclear weapons industry, and supportive counseling , which may help diminish stress and calm anxieties.
