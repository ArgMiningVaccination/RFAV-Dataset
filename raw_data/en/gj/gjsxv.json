Mr. President, H.R. 17550.the social security amendments of 1070,is truly a monumental bill. In terms of December 16, 1970dollars, the $10 billion of benefits pro-vided by this bill make it the most sig-nificant social insurance legislation Con-gr\u00ebss has ever considered. In terms ofpeople, the impact of the blll\u2014eonsid-ered as a whole\u2014is even more impressive.Not only does the measure directly affectthe lives of 26 million social securitybeneficiaries but also it provides welfareincreases for 3 million aged, blind, anddisabled welfare recipients and pensionincreases for 1,600,000 needy veteransand their widows.In addition, through the trade amend-ments included in this bill more than2,500,000 textile and shoe employees willreceive a sense of job security directlyfrom the bill and tens of millions moreemployees will find comfort in the. newrules governing Tariff Commission inves-tigations of injury resulting from in-creased imports.Under the amendments to upgrade thework incentive plan, ti,e bill offers thehope of independence to 2 million per-sons who today are unable to qualify forgainful employment and must suffer theIndignity of dependence on welfare tosustain themselves and their families.Mr. President, the Committee on Fi-nance has added important new titles tothe bill\u2014one dealing with internationaltrade matters, and another which in-cludes a substantial test of various alter-natives to the welfare mess and offerssignificant reforms in the programs ofaid,to the aged, blind, and disabled. Thislatter part of the bill also reaffirms theintent of Congress in several areas re-gardingeligibilityforwelfare\u2014areaswhere the courts have misconstrued thewelfare statutes with resulting large in-creases In welfare caseloads.These new titles are added to the billwith a single thought in mind\u2014to ex-pedite the legislative process. It Is axio-matic that one bill can be acted on inless time than three. The committee wasadvised that amendments to add thetrade bill and amendments to add thefamily assistance plan to this bill wouldbe offered during the debate on the bill.They all look, on this social security billas a measure that is going to be pre-sented to the President and that factmakes the bill a prime target for con-troversial amendments late in the ses-sion.There are Senators on the FinanceCommittee who favored these amend-ments and there are others who opposethem. We spent considerable time dis-cussing procedures for acting on the billand in the final analysis It was agreedthat we would vote on the questions incommittee. The crucial motion to addthe family assistance plan was rejectedby a 6-to-bvote of the committee. Thecrucial vote on the trade bill came as amotion to separate it from the socialsecurity bill. The motion failed by a voteof 6 to 11.So the bill as reported by the commit-tee does not Include the family assist-ance plan but It does Include the tradebill. The basic matters covered by thetrade amendment are not new to theSenate. Nonetheless, the committee de-cided unanimously to Interrupt its exec-CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014SENATEutive sessions and hold 'public hearingson the trade amendments before wevoted on them.I had been urged previously by 15 orso Senators to hold hearings on this billbefore the committee acted. Among thosesigning the request was the senior Sen-ator from New York. During our 2 daysof hearings the committee heard fromthe Office of Special Trade Representa-tive, the Secretary of Commerce, theSecretary of State, the Director of theOffice of Emergency Preparedness, theAssistant Secretary of Agriculture, anda number of broad-based trade associa-tions who had expressed interest in tes-tifying. While we did not have time tohear allthose whom we would havewished to hear, the committee membersdid get a clear indication of the adminis-tration's position on this bill and also ofthe position of many interested parties. Let me now describe the significantfeatures of the committee bill, and Ishall submit for the record a more de-tailed summary of the provisions of thebill.The committee bill provides $6,500,-000,000 of additional benefits under thecash portion of the social security pro-gram.INCREASE IN SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITSunder the committee bill, social secu-rity payments to the nearly 26 mIllionbeneficiaries on the rolls at the end ofJanuary 1971, and to those who comeon the rolls after that date, Would beincreased by 10 percent, with a newminimum benefit of $100.The House-passedbillwould haveincreased benefits by 5 percent, with aminimum benefit of $67.20. The com-mittee Increased the minimum socialsecurity benefit from the $67.20 in theHouse bill to $100 In order to providesubstantial help for those who havethe greatest need\u2014those whose socialsecurity benefits are so low that if theyhave no other income\u2014and most do not\u2014they are unable to meet their' basiceveryday needs for food and shelter.Under present law monthly benefitsfor workers who retire at age 65 in1971 now range from $64 to $193.70;under the House-passed bill they wouldrange from $67.20 to $203.40; under thecommittee bill they would range from$100 to $213.10. Benefits for a couplein January 1971 would average $198 un-S 20315The committee members studied in-tently the massive volume of statementssubmitted fot the record. We also hadavailable to us 16 volumes of House hear-ings on this matter, which took over 1month of public testimony, the hearingsof the Committee on Finance held in1967, which covered some 1,200 pages oftestimony, and the committee's oversightreview of U.S. trade policy in 1968 cov-ering another 1,000 pages of submitteddocuments.Considering the features of the billwhich revisethesocialsecuritytaN. structure, it is a fair statement that H.R.17550 literally reaches into every homein America.The followingchartIndicatesthe value of benefits included in H.R. 17550as reported by the Committee on Fi-nance, and the number of persons af-fected by them. derpresentlaw;under the House-passed billthey would average $217;under the committee bill they would beincreasedto$233.Forawidowed mother with two children, the averagebenefit for January 1971 under presentlaw would be $295; under the House-passed bill It would be $311; under thecommittee billit would be $331. Thebenefit increase would mean additionalbenefit payments of $5,000,000,000 in the first year.Although the benefit increase will beeffective for January 1971, the SocialSecurity Administration advises us thatlegislation this late In the year makesit impossible to get the Increased ben-efits into the hands of the beneficiarieswith the regular check that goes out on February 3. They need about 3 monthsto adjust their records and computersbefore they can pay at the new rates.Therefore, the first check at the newrates will be sent out on April 3, andlater in the month another check rep- resenting the retroactive Increase forJanuary and February will be sent out.This is the same procedure followed lastyear when a benefit increase was effec-tive for January, but was not paid untilApril.Mr. President, this chart compares thebenefits under the committee bill withthe benefits available under present lawand those which wouldhave appliedunder the House bill for a single personand a married couple with various levelsof earnings.CHART 1.\u2014INCREASED BENEFITS UNDER HR. 17550 1st full year CostNumber ut persons affected Social securityCash benefits $6, 500, 000, 00026,000,000 beneficiaries.

Childcare,familyplanning, work pensioners.Total value iv HR. 17550 10,000,000, 000 S 20316 INCmEASE IN FAMILY MAXIMUMSThe committee bill also corrects a dis-crimination under which families al-ready on the rolls at the time of enact-ment of a social security increase get theincrease while those coming on the rollsin the future are denied it. Under our bill,all families will benefit from this increaseand from future increases without regardto when they become eligible for bene-fits.COST-OF LIVING INCREASESOnce the benefits are brought up todate, they need to be kept up to date. Andwhile the Congress has in the past actedto maintain social security benefits atrealistic and adequate levels, there havebeen lags irs legislation during times ofrapidly rising prices. The automatic cost-of-livingincreasesprovidedinH.R.17550 will insure that such lags in benefitincreases will not occur in the future.While the committee is in agreementwith the sense of the House bill as to thedesirability of an automatic adjustmentin social security benefits, the committeebill revises the House text to stress therole of the Congress in setting socialsecurity tax and bencfit lcvels. Under thecommittee bill, social security benefitswouid rise automatically as the cost ofliving goes up in the event Congressfailed to legislate on social security bene-fits or taxes. The full cost of the auto-matic benefit increases would be metequally by increases in tax rates and inthe tax base which would go into effectat the same time that benefits are in-creased, with the strictly actuarial func-tion of determining the base and therates being performed by the Secretaryof Health, Education, and Welfare.The committee bill provides that theautomatic Increases would go into effectunless Congress acts otherwise to effect achange in social security benefit levels,a change in the schedule of social secu-rity tax rates, or a change in the socialsecurity tax base. In effect, we are guar-anteeing that congressional inaction willnot prevent automatic social securityhikes in periods of rising prices.SPECIAL PAYMxNTS TO PEOPLE AGE 72 ANDOLDERUnder present law, special paymentsof $46 a month for an individual and $69for a couple are made to people age 72and over who have not worked under theprogram long enough to qualify for regu-lar cash benefits. This is the so-calledProuty amendment of 1966. Under thecommittee bill, as under the House bill,the payments would be increased Jan-uary 1, 1971, by 5 percent, to $48.30 amonth for an individual and $72.50 for acouple.LIBERALIZATION OF THE RETIREMENT TESTAnother important feature of the com-mittee bill makes significant improve-ments in the retirement test. These im-provements\u2014wh.ich were alsointhe House bill\u2014provide an increase from$1,680 to $2,000 in the amount a bene-ficiary under age 72 may earn in a yearand still be paid full social security bene-fits for that year. The change reflectsincreases in earnings levels that haveoccurred since the present amount of$1,680 was set in 1967. The bill also pro-vides for automatic upward adjustmentsof the amount in the future as earningslevels rise, thereby making it unneces-sary for Congress to act in the future tokeep the earnings exemption in line withraises in wage levels generally.Under present law, each $2 earned be-tween $1,680 and in a $2,880 reduces benefits by reduction that appliesto earnings above $2,880 reduces incen-tives for beneficiaries to work. The com-mittee bill would provide for a $1 reduc-tion for each $2 earned with respect to allearnings above $2,000, so that the morea beneficiary works and earns, the morespendable income he would have. Thebill would also increase from $140 to$166.66 the amount of wages the bene-ficiary may earn in a given month andget benefits for that month, regardlessof his annual earnings.In1971 about 650,000 beneficiarieswould receive additional benefits, andabout 380,000 persons who would receiveno benefit under present law would re-ceive some benefits as a result of theretirement test liberalizations. The addi-tional benefit payments for the first fullyear would be about $404,000,000.INCREASED WIDOW'S AND WIDOWER'S INSURANCEBENEFITSBoth the House bill and the committeebill are aimed at providing benefits to awidow equal to the benefits the widowsdeceased husband was receiving or wouldhave received. Unfortunately, the waythe House bill was written a widow couldactually receive a benefit substantiallyhigher than her husband received beforehis death. Generally, under the commit-tee bill the widow would receive either100 percent of the benefit her husbandwas actually receiving at the time of hisdeath, or, if he was not receiving benefits.100 percent of the benefit he would havebeen eligible for at age 65.December 16, 1970About 2,700,000 wIdows and widowerson the rolls at the end of January 1971 would receive additional benefits, and$649,000,000 additional benefit paymentswould be made in the first full year.AGE 62 COMPUTATION POINT FOR MENUnder the present law, the method ofcomputing benefits for men and womendiffers in that years up to age 65 must betaken into account in determining aver-age earnings for men, while for womenonly years up to age 62 must be takeninto account. Also, benefit eligibility isfigured up to age 65 for men and up toage 62 for women. These differences,which provide special advantages forwomen, would be eliminated by applyingthe same rules to men as now apply towomen.Under thecommittee'sbill,there would be a gradual transition to the newprocedures. The age62 computationwould apply only to those becoming en-titled to benefits in the future; the num-ber of years used in determining Insuredstatus and in computing benefits formen would be reduced in three steps sothat men reaching age 62 in 1973 andlater would have only years up to age 62taken into account in determining in-sured status and average earnings.In the first full year, an additional$6,000,000 in benefits would be paid outunder this provision. This amount willscale upward In future years, eventuallyinvolving$1,000,000,000.Underthechange in benefit eligibility requirementsfor men, some 2,000 people\u2014workers,their dependents and survivors not eli-gibleunderpresent law\u2014wouldbe added to the rolls in the first year.ADOPTIONSThe committee simplified the adoptionrules in present law so that eligibility ofchildren adopted by retired workers andchildren adopted by disabled workerswould be determined under commonrules. Under the committee bill, a childwho is adopted after a worker is entitledto benefits would be able to get child'sbenefits based on the worker's earningsif: First, the adoption was decreed by acourt of competent jurisdiction withinthe United States; second, the child livedwith the worker in the United States forthe year before the worker became dis-abled or entitled to an old-age or disabil-ity insurance benefit; three, the child re-ceived at least one-half of his supportfrom the worker for that year; andfourth, the child was under age 18 atthe time he began living with the worker.These simplified rules will bring con-siderable equity to a very complex areaof the law and eliminate the need formany special purpose amendments in thefuture.PROVISIONS RELATING TO DISABILITYUnder present law, there is a 6-monthwaiting period before a disabled personis eligible for social security disabilityinsurance benefits. However, the monthof disablement does not count as part oftile waiting period. Also, the check forthe month following the waiting periodis not paid until the next month. Thishas caused considerable hardship to dis-abled people, particularly those sufferinga terminal illness. The committee's billwould reduce the waiting period from 6CHART 2.\u2014ILLUSTRATIVE MONTHLY BENEFITS PAYABLE UNDER PRESENT LAW, UNDER THE HOUSE BILL, ANDUNDER THE SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE BILLCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATE .Average CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATE S 20317months to 4 months. About 140,000 peo-ple\u2014disabled workers and their depend-ents and disabled widows and widowers\u2014would be able to receive a benefit forJanuary 1971 as a result of this provi-sion. About $185 million in additionalbenefits would be paid out during thefirst full year.DISABILITY OFFSETThe committee deleted the provisionin the House bill which would have raisedthe ceiling on income from combinedworkmen's compensation and social se-curity disability insurance benefits from80 percent to 100 percent of the disabledworker's average current earnings beforethe onset of his disability, The objectiveof the offset. provisions is to avoid thepayment of combined amounts of socialsecurity benefits and workmen's comperi-sation payments that would be excessivein comparison with thebeneficiary'searnings before he became disabled. Al-though the committee agrees with thecompassionate objective of the Housebill, it feared the combination of First,payments equal to past wages, plus, sec-ond, tax exemption for these amounts,could result in payments in excess ofprior take-home pay and this couldjeopardizeeffortstorehabilitatethe worker and restore him to gainful em-ployment. The committee was of theopinion that the best interest of thedisabled worker in his own rehabilitation.MEDICARE AND MEDICAIDDuring the past 2 years, the committeehas devoted an extensive and almost dis-proportionate share of its time to deter-mining and evaluating the many prob-lems In the huge medicare and medicaidprograms.Parenthetically,it might be worth-while to mention that during our yearsof work we have shared with the Com-mittee on Ways and Means informationwe have developed. The Committee onWays and Means, in turn, has given usthe benefit of their efforts.The medicare and medicaid programsare here to stay. With that in mind, itwas more Important than ever for thecommittee to act to correct the problemswhich our work revealed. The House, Inits bill, attempted to and did developsolutions to some of the important prob-lems. We accepted, and in some in-stances, improved upon amendments inthe House bill designed to bring medicareanct medicaid costs under control. Wehave also added amendments to furtherachieve the common objectives of boththe House and Senate\u2014reasonable andequitable controls on the costs and utili-zation of health care services with theminimum amount of redtape.We believe the amendments of theHouse and those added by the FinanceCommittee will go a very long way to-ward assuring the taxpayers and the mil-lions of citizens who depend upon medi-care and medicaid that those programswill function more effectively and eco-nomically In delivering quality healthcare.Let me describe the more importantfeatures of this part of the committee'sbill.PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS REVIEWORGANIZATIONSMy distinguished colleague from Utah(Mr. BENNETT) has worked very hard onthe provision in the committee's bill thatprovides for the establishment and useof professional standards review organi-zations. I would not wish to let this op-portunity go by without recognizing hisoutstanding effortsin developing thisprovision.Underthisprovision,professionalstandards review organizations would beestablished to review the utilization ofhealth care provided under the medicareand medicaid programs. The Secretary ofHealth, Education, and Welfare would,afterconsultation with national andlocal health professions and agencies,designate appropria.te areas throughoutthe Nation for which professional stand-ards review organizations would be es-tablished. Areas may cover an entireState or parts of a State, but generallya minimum of 3d0 practicing doctorswould be included within one area.Organizations representing substantialnumbers of physicians in an area, suchas medical foundations and societies,would be invited and encouraged to par-ticipate. Where the Secretary finds thatsuch organizations are not willing or can-not reasonably be expected to developcapabilitiestocarry out professionalstandards review organization functionsin an effective, economical, and timelymanner, he would enter into agreementswith such other agencies or organizationswith professional competence as he findsare willing and capable of carrying outsuch functions.The Secretary would approve those or-ganizations which can reasonably be ex-pected to improve and expand the pro-fessional review process. The initial ap-proval would be made on a conditionalbasis, not to exceed 2 years, with thereview organizations operating concur-rently with the present review system.During the transitional period, medicarecarriers and intermediaries are expectedto abide by the decision of the profes-sionalstandards revieworganizationwhere the professional standards revieworganization has acted. This reliance willpermit a more complete appraisal of theeffectiveness of the conditionally ap-provedprofessionalstandardsreview organization. Where performance of anorganization is unsatisfactory, and theSecretary's efforts to bring about promptnecessary improvement fail, he couldterminate it.s participation.Provider, physician, and patient pro-files and other relevant data would becollected and reviewed on an ongoingbasis to the maximum extent feasible toidentify persons and Institutions thatprovide services requiring more exten-sivereview. Regional norms of carewould be used In the review process asroutine checkpoints in determining whenexcessive services may have been pro-vided. The norms would be used in de-termining the point at which physiciancertification of need for continued In-stitutional care would be made and re-viewed. Initial priority in assembling andusing data and profiles would be assignedto those areas most productive in pin-pointing problems so as to conservephysician time and maximize the pro-ductivity of physician review.The professional standards review or-ganization would be permitted to employthe services of qualified personnel, suchas registered nurses, who could, underthe direction and control of physicians,aid in assuring effective and timely re-view. They would also be authorized touse the services of effective hospital utili-zationreviewcommitteesandlocal medical society review committees inperforming their tasks.Where advance approval by the revieworganizations for institutional admissionis required, such approval would providethe basis for a pjesumption of medicalnecessity for purposes of medicare andmedicaid benefit payments. Failure ofa physician, institution, or other healthcare supplier to seek advance approval,whererequired,could be consideredcause for disallowance of affected claims.In addition to acting on their own ini-tiative, the review organizations wouldreport on matters referred to them bythe Secretary. They would also recom-mend appropriate action against personsresponsible for gross or continued over-use of services, use of services in an tin-necessarily costly manner, or for inade-quate quality of services and would actto the extent of their authority or influ-ence to correct improper activities.A NationalProfessionalStandards Review Council would be established bythe Secretary to review the operationsof the local area review organizations,advise the Secretary on their effective-ness, and make recommendations fortheir improvement. The Council wouldbe composed of physicians, a majorityof whom would be selected from nomi-nees of national organizations represent-ing practicing physicians. Other physi-cians on the Council would be recom-mended by consumers and other healthcare Interests.INSPECTOR GENERAL FOR HEALTHADMINISTRATIONWe on the committee have been In-creasingly concerned about making surethat the medicare and medicaid pro-grams operate effectively and as Con-gress intends. I know other Members ofthe Congress and the people who. admin-ister these programs have been con-cerned, too. But these programs are verycomplex and far reaching and sometimesthe review processes being used cannotidentify problems or discrepancies assoon as we all would like. And sometimesthere is no way to promptly correct theproblems that have been found.I want to commend two distinguishedmembers of the committee-the Senatorfrom Connecticut (Mr. RIBICOFF), andthe Senator from Delaware (Mr. Wit-LIAMS)\u2014who sponsored a provision Inthe committee bill that will go a longway to alleviate our concern about thesedifficulties. The provision will establishan Office of Inspector General for HealthAdministration within the Departmentof Health, Education, and Welfare. S 20318Hisresponsibilities will be patternedafter the successful approach by theAgency for International Developmentand theinvestigativeresponsibilities,with respect to congressional requests,required of the U.S. Tariff Commission.In carrying out his responsibilites, hewill not be under the control of any offi-cer of Health, Education, and Welfareother than the Secretary, and he will beprovided withsufficientauthorityto make sure that medicare and medicaidfunction as Congress intends. He will con-tinuously review these programs, and anyother health programs established undersocial secruity, to determine their effi-ciency and economy of administration,their compliance with the law, and theextent to which the objectives and pur-poses for which they were established arebeing realized.He will recommend ways to correctdeficiencies or to improve these pro-grams. And he will have the authorityto suspend regulations, or practices orprocedures which he finds not in har-mony with congressional intent or which*111 lead to inefficiency and waste.. It isImportant to have a mechanism for dy-namic and ongoing review of these pro-grams, and that the person with this re-sponsibility be at a level where he canpromptly call attention to problems anddeal with them in a timely and effectivefashion. Armed with the authority pro-vided under this provision, I believe thevoice of the Inspector General will beeffective in Improving the efficiency andeconomy with which the medicare andmedicaid programs of the Departmentof Health, Education, and Welfare areadministered.WAIVEROF NURSINGREQTJIREMENTS ZN RURALHOSPITALSSeveral members of the committeewere concerned about the problem cre-ated by the need to assure the availabilityof hospital services of adequate quality inrural areas and the fact that existingshortages of qualified nursing personnelgenerally make It difficult for some ruralhospitals to meet the nursing staff re-quirements In present law. The commit-tee has attempted to resolve this problemby including In the bill a provision thatwould allow the Secretary, under certainconditions, to waive the medicare re-quirement that a hospital have registeredprofessional nurses on duty around theclock. This requirement could be waivedonly If, First, the hospital has at leasta registered nurse on the daytime shift,Second, has made, and is continuing tomake, a real effort to hire enough nursesto meet the requirements, and Third, isunable to employ qualified personnel be-cause of nursing shortages in the area.Also, the hospital must be located in anisolated geclgraphical area in which hos-pital facilities are in short supply andthe closest other facilities are not easilyaccessible to people of the area. Andfinally, It must be known that nonpar-ticipation of the hospital would seriouslyreduce the availability of hospital servicesto medicare beneficiaries living in thearea.The Secretary would, of course, regu-larly review the situation with respect toCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEeach of these hospitals and the waiverwould be granted on an annual basis fora period of only one year. This waiverwould apply only to the nursing staffrequirements and would expire on De-cember 31, 1975.PROFICIENCY TESTING OF HEALTH PERSONNELIn 1967 the committee recommendedthat the Secretary of Health, Education,and Welfare consult with- appropriateprofessional health organizations andState health agencies explore, develop,and apply appropriate means\u2014includingtesting piocedures\u2014for determining theproficiencyofhealthcare personnelotherwise disqualified or limited in re-sponsibility under regulations of the Sec-retary.The Department has taken little or noaction, except with respect to directorsof clinical laboratories, in developing pro-ficiency testing and training courses. Thepersonnel problems which existed in 1967and which the committee sought to cor-rect have been aggravated as a result ofthe Department's continued inaction.We are all aware of the acute shortageof nursing personnel in America. This hasforced many hundreds of nursing homesto cover some shifts with \"waived\" prac-tical nurses. These are practical nurses,who do not have the required formaltraining, and Who, In many States, havebeen licensed on a walvered basis. Un-doubtedly, a substantial proportion ofthese racticaI nurses, who have years ofexperience, are competent, but they donot meet the medicare and medicaidcharge-nurse requirements, Therefore,unfortunately, many otherwise-qualifiednursing homes are being or soon may beforced out of the medicare program because of the unavailability of a registerednurse or a licensed practical nurse whomeets the medicare requirements. Simi-lar problems exist with respect to physi-cal therapists, medical technologists, andpsychiatric technicians.The committee has therefore added tothe House bill a provision which requiresthe Secretary to explore\u00e7 develop, andapply appropriate means of determiningthe proficiency of health personnel dis-qualified or limited in responsibility un-der present regulations. The committeeexpects that the Secretary will regularlyreportto it and to the Committee onWays and Means of the House of Rep-resentatives concerning the progress inthis area.REIMBURSEMENT OF PHYSICIANS IN TEAcHINGHOSPITALSThe committee is aware that a majorproblem\u2014of almost scandalous propor-tions\u2014in medicare administration is thepayment under part B on a fee-for-service basis for the services of \"super-visory\" physicians in teaching hospi-tals\u2014services which in many instanceswere never rendered by the physician inwhose name they were billed. We esti-mate these payments to be more than$100,000,000 annually and in general,such payments were not made prior tomedicare. It certainly was not the intentof Congress that medicare cover non-customarycharges.TheComptrollerGeneral of the United States has sentDecember 16, 1970several disturbing reports to the com-mittee that document and detail theproblems in this area.The House bill attempts to deal withthis problem by providing for paymentunderpartB\u2014physician'sbills-for services of certain teaching physicianson a cost rather than a charge basis.Payment on a fee-for-service basis wouldonly be made if there is general billingfor such services to all patients and col-lection from those able to pay.The committeebelieves,andhas amended the House bill to provide, thatpayments for services furnished by su-pervisory physicians in teaching hospi-tals should be made on a cost basis underpart A\u2014hospital insurance\u2014unless thepatient is truly a private patient or un-less the hospital since 1965 has chargedall patients in full, including the medi-caredeductibleandcoinsuranceamounts, and has collected from at leasthalf of them. For donated services ofteaching physicians a salary cost wouldbe imputed equal to the cost ofsalaried physicians.LIMITS FOR REASONABLE CHARGESFOR PHYSICIANS' SERVICESAnother specific concern of the com-mittee has been the threat that continu-ing increases in physicians' fees pose tothe effectivness of the medicare program.We certainly recognize that there arecomplex reasons for these increases. Partof the problem is that more and morepeople are seeking medical care and thenumber of doctors is not increasing fastenough to keep up with the demand. Butsomething must be done.The House bill which the committeeapproves without change moves in thedirection of an approach to reimburse-ment of physicians that ties recognitionof fee increases to some reasonable indexthat reflects what is happening In therest of the economy, thereby limitingrecognition of Increases in charges toamounts that economic data Indicatewould be fair to all concerned. Under thisapproach, recognition of fee increaseswould continue, but only in relation tothings that are happening in other partsof the economy that have a bearing onthe physician's cost of doing business.What is proposed is not a limit on whata physician may charge under the medi-care program, but rather a limit on whatthe program will recognize as the pre-vailing fee in the locality. Thus, a limi-tation would be imposed only where aphysician'schargesaresignificantlyhigher than the usual or prevailingcharge in the locality for the same serv-ice, or where a physician raises his cus-tomary charge significantly above formerlevels.This is not an effort to penalize anygroup in the health care delivery systemto interfere with anyone's right toreceive just compensation for their serv-ices. The objective is to move toward asystemofdeterminingreasonablecharges which will be related to thegeneral state of the economy. Indexeswill be developed to give recognition tosuch things as the cost of producingmedical services, costs of living, and December 16, 1970 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATE S 20319earnings of other professional people.This approach should provide the mdi.-vidual physician with an objective meas-ure of the fairness of increases In hischarges.LIMITS ON REIMBURSEMENT FOR CAPITALEXPENDITURESThe cOmmittee also approved the pro-vision In the House bill that would au-thorize the Secretary of Health, Educa-tion, and Welfare to withhold or reducereimbursement amounts for depreciation,interest, and other expenses related tocapital expenditures for plant and equip-ment In excess of $100,000 where suchexpenditures and equipment are deter-mined to be inconsistent with State orlocal health facility plans. This feature Issimilar to a provision in the committeebill of 1967. Under this program, the Sec-retary would make agreements withStates to utilize the services of qualifiedhealth planning agencies to help In ad-ministration of this provision. The agen-cies will submit findings and recom-mendations with respect to proposedcapital expenditures that are incon-sistent with the plans developed by theseagenciesThe committee amended the provisionto provide for appeal at the State levelwhen negative decisions are made by theplanning agencies. This provision wouldnot Impede the growth and expansionof hospitals and skilled nursing homesbut would provide guidance to assurethat future growth is achieved in a sensi-ble, orderly manner. It should have littleor no effect on most hospitals and nurs-ing homes since additional facilities aregenerally constructed only in response toa need of the community. But this pro-vision should discourage a hospital fromacting without regard for the needs ofthe community.LIMITATION ON COSTS RECOGNIZED ASREASONABLEUnder present law, providers of serv-ices are paid on the basis of reasonablecost. However, there are a number ofproblems that inhibit making a decisionthat the costs for a particular providerare not reasonable.The committee is mindful of the factthat costs can and do vary from one in-stitution to another as a result of dif-ferences in size, in the nature and scopeof services provided, type of patienttreated, the location of the institution,and various other factors affecting theefficient delivery of needed health serv-ices. It is also true, however, that costscan vary from one institution to an-other as a result of variations in effi-ciency of operation, or the provision ofamenities in plush surroundings. Thecommittee believes that it is undesirable,to reimburse health care institutions forcosts that are the result of gross in-efficiency in operation or provision of ex-pensive services that are not medicallynecessary. These costs cannot properlybe considered \"reasonable\" for purposesof payment under medicare and medi-caid.Accordingly, the committee approvesthe House provision which would give theSecretary new authority to set limits oncosts recognized for certain classes ofproviders In various service areas. Thisnew authority differs from existing au-thority in several ways and meets theparticularproblemsidentifiedabove First, it would be exercised on a prospec-tive, rather than retrospective, basis sothat the provider would know in advancethe limits to Government recognition ofincurred costs and have the opportunityto avoid incurring costs tht are not re-imbursable. Second, relatively high coststhat cannot be justified by the provideras reasonable for the results obtainedwould not be reimbursable. Third, pro-vision would be made for a provider tocharge the beneficiary for the costs ofitems or services in excess of or moreexpensive than those that are deter-mined to be necessary in the efficient de-livery of needed health services.ADVANCE APPROVAL OF CARE IN EXTENDED CAREFACILITIES AND HOME HEALTH CAREOne of the key problem areas in medi-care has been the substantial number ofretroactive denial of benefits for careprovided in extended care facilities. Iknow that I have received many heart-breaking letters from people faced withtremendousbillsforservicesthey thought were covered by their medicareinsurance.To deal with the problem, the com-mittee has modified the provision in theHouse bill which authorizes the- Secre-tary of Health, Education, and Welfareto establish presumptive periods of cov-erage on the basis of a physician's cer-tification for patients admitted to anextended care facility or started on ahome health plan. Under the committeeamendment, to the greatest extent pos-sible, prior review and approval of phy-sicians' certifications of patient need forextended care would be required. Unlessthe doctor's certification was specificallydisapproved in advance, medicare cover-age would apply and payment would bemade for the lesser of: First, the initiallycertified and approved period, second,until notice of disapproval, or third, 10days. The committee bill also providesfor a similar advance approval approachto the determination of coverage andpayment for home health services. ThecOmmittee hopes that this amendmentwill help to solve the problem of retro-active denials that have been so burden-some to medicare beneficiaries.ADDITIONAL SAFEGUARDSThe committee bill adds a number ofsignificant features to the statute to pro-tect the medicare program from abuses.One of these facilitates the recovery ofoverpayments by authorizing a lien Infavor of the Government In the amountof the overpayment.Another provides specific penalties forfraud and abuse of the program andmakes it a criminal offense to solicit,offer, or accept bribes or kickbacks\u2014in-cluding the rebating of a portion of amedicare or medicaid fee or charge for apatient referral.Still another would give the Secretaryauthoritytoterminate paymentfor services rendered by an abusive providerof health and medical services\u2014thosewho have made a practice of furnishinginferior or harmful supplies or services,engaged in fraudulent activities, or con-sistently overcharged for their services.Along with these structural improve-ments in the medicare program the com-mittee bill proposes new rules governingthe reimbursement of physical therap-ists,speechtherapists,occupationaltherapists, and other specialists such associal workers, medical records, librar-ians, and dieticians. Under the bill pay-ments to these providers will be limitedto a \"salary-related\" basis. In effect theirpayment will not be on a fee-for-servicebasis, but will be limited to the amountgenerally equal to the salary such a per-son would reasonably have been paid ifhe were an employee. Of course, adjust-ments are authorized for expenses in-curred by these people as self-employedpersons\u2014office expenses, travel expenses,and the like.A new system of publicizing deficien-cies in health care facilities is also in-cluded in the committee bill. This infor-mation would enable physicians and pa-tients alike to make sounder judgmentsabout their own use of available facilitiesin the community and should also serveto speed up the process of correction ofthe deficiencies.HEALTH MAiNTENANCE ORGANIZATIONSThe bill as passed by the House wouldprovide medicare beneficiaries with anoption to have all covered services fur-nished or arranged for by a health main-tenance organization\u2014a group practiceor other prepayment capitation plan.The administration has strongly advo-cated this approach to health care pay-ment and arrangement, expressing theview that it would provide incentives tohold medicare costs down. Existing pre-payment plans such as Kaiser in Cali-forniaandHIP\u2014HealthInsurance Plan\u2014in New York have demonstratedanabilitytoprovide comprehensivehealth care of good quality efficientlyand economically. The administration inurging this amendment expressed thehope that it would expand availability toolder people of the desirable character-istics of prepaid comprehensive healthcare.-Thecommittee has been concernedthat this new medicare option withoutsufficient controls could turn out to bean area of potential abuse of the pro-gram rather than a new benefit for olderpeople. Therefore, the committee hasamended the provision substantially toinclude safeguards with respect to re-Imbursement to health maintenance or-ganizations and, of great importance,safeguards to protect and assure that theinterests of medicare beneficiaries whochoose this option are fully protected.The committee amendments, gen- erally, speaking, are technical in naturebut their combined effect is to plug po-tential loopholes in the plan before theydevelop. With these amendments andwith the direction to the Inspection Gen-eral to oversee the implementation of thehealth maintenance organization's serv-ices the committee agrees that the cost-saving potentials of health maintenanceorganizations should be fully explored.ADDITIONAL MEDICARE BENEFITSThe committee bill again recommendsthat the Senate add certain services ofoptometrists and chiropractors to thebenefits available under medicare. In S 20320bothinstances, safeguards are providedto assure no deterioration in the quaiityof care provided under the program.In addition, the bill provides that agedpersons not eligible for hospital insur-ance may \"buy in\" to the program, pay-ing the full cost of this new protection\u2014$27 per month at the beginning. Stateand local governments could also buyin for their aged employees or retirees.We have also provided for payment ofdoctor's bills associated with hospitaliza-tion in a Canadian hospital. This changeshould be quite helpful to people livingalong the border where local hospitalsare not available.ADMINISTRATIVE SIMPLIFICATIONThe committee bill contains severalfeatures intended to ease and simplifythe administration of the medicare pro-gram. An important example of this sortof change is the provision calling foruniform standards for nursing homesunder medicare and medicaid. Under thisprovision a single set of health, safety,environmental, ad staffing standardswould apply and a siugle State agencywould certify the facility both for medi-care and medicaid. This change reflectsthe essential similarity between the careprovided on a short term basis in ex-tended care facilities under medicareand that provided on a long term basisin skilled nursing homes under medicaid.Anotherconsiderablesimplificationconcerns the present complex reimburse-ment formula for paying extended carefacilities on a cost basis, with retro-active adjustments which cut back onallowances and makes everyone mad.Under the committee bill, the medicareprogram would be authorized to applymedicaid's skilled nursing home reim-bursement rules to its own extended carefacilities. This rule would be availablewhere medicaid's rates are reasonablyrelated to costs. It will give nursing homeoperatorsadvanceassuranceofthe amount of pay they can expect to receivefor caring for medicare beneficiaries.The committee bill also provides forexperimentation with prospective reini-bursement methods which might offerIncentives to hold costs down or to pro-duce services in the most efficient andeffective manner. If these experimentsare successful much of the difficulty withtoday's retroactive payment rules couldbe solved.LIMITATION ON MEDICAID REIMSURSEMENTLike the House, the Committee onFinance is concerned with the rapidlyrising costs of medicaid and the over-utilization of medicaid services. How-ever, the approach taken by the House, ofcutting off Federal matching funds forlong term hospital and nursing homestays, seemed unnecessarily harsh. Analternative suggested by the committeewould authorize the Secretary of Health,Education, and Welfare to reduce selec-tively the Federal matching rates forinstitutional care where professional re-view and medical audit procedures areInadequate or ineffective. States employ-ing utilization review and medical auditfunctions properly would not be affectedby this cutback provision. This appearsto be a more equitable way of containingthe costs of long term institutional careunder medicaid than the House provisionCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEwhich would have automatically reducedFederal matching funds now available tothe States for financing long term insti-tutional care in general hospitals, mentalhospitals,tuberculosishospitals,and nursing homes without permitting theSecretary to exercise discretionary judg-ment.INTERMEDIATE CARE FACILITIESAnother amendment, authorizing in-termediate care under medicaid ratherthan under title XI, as at present, em-phasizes that intermediate care facilitiesare institutions providing health-relatedservices below the level of skilled nurs-ing homes. For the first time, it wouldmake such care, now limited to thosereceiving or eligible for cash assistance,available under medicaid to the medi-cally indigent. Intermediate care wouldcover those requiring institutional carebeyond residential care and who would,in the absence of such care, require place-ment in a skilled nursing home or mentalhospital. These facilities would be re-quired to have at least one full-timelicensed practical nurse on their staffs.Additionally, subject to appropriate re-quirements, intermediate care would alsobe available to mentally retarded personsin public Institutions. Because the com-mittee felt that present review require-ments are insulllcient, States would berequired to provide assurance to the Sec-retary that appropriate and effectiveutilization review and medical audit pro-cedures are being applied to intermediatecare, as is already required for patientsin skilled nursing homes.MENTALLY ILLOnearea where we have put off toolong the provision of Federal aid forbadly needed hospital care concerns thetreatment of mentally Ill children. Manyof these poor unfortunates could behelped to a better life if adequate careis provided for them in their youth. Iam pleased that the committee agreedwith me when I offered an amendmentto provide medical treatment for them.Under this amendment Federal matchingpayments would be authorized undermedicaid to States for care of mentallyill children under 21 years of age inpublic mental institutions. Such fundswould be available where States main-tained their present fiscal effort, for pa-tients in accredited mental hospitals whoare undergoing a program of active medi-cal treatment. Presently, such Federalmatching is authorized only for persons65 or over.MEDICAID'S UNXFORMFrY RULES REVISEDUnder present law, all medicaid recipi-ents in a State must be eligible for thesame scope of services, and the servicesmust be available throughout the State.PresenttitleXIX requirementsfor\"statewideneas\" of amount, duration, andscope of benefits have created problemsfor States who want to contract withorganizations,suchasneighborhoodhealth centers or prepaid group prac-tices, to provide services to title XIX re-cipients. The services are often broaderin scope than those available under medi-caid, but are not available throughoutthe State.A committee amendment facilitates ar-rangements with comprehensive healthorganizations and health groups offeringDecember 16, 1970services different from those in the reg-ular State medicaid plans.It also makes it possible for States toutilize reasonable uniform deductiblesand copayment features in their medic-aid plans for the medically indigent with-out requiring that they also apply to thewelfare recipients covered by the plan.This will help make it possible to con-trol excess utilization if a State requiresthe medically indigent to share a rea-sonable part of the cost of their own care.MEDICAID MAINTENANCE OF EFFORTThe committee approved the provisionin the House bill to repeal the require-ment that all States must move towarda comprehensive medicaid program by1977. In addition, the committee billwould repeal the provision requiring thatStates maintain theirefforts by notcutting back on the, amount they spendfor medicaid from 1 year to the next.The committeebelievesthatStates should be allowed to decide how exten-sive a medicaid program they desire.PROTECTION AGAINST CATASTROPHIC ILLNESSThe Committee on Finance is con-cerned about the devastating effect whicha catastropic illness can have on fam-ilies unfortunate enough to be affectedby such an illness. Over the past decadesscience and medicine have taken greatstrides in their ability to sustain andprolong life. Patients with kidney failure,which until recently would have beenrapidly fatal, can now be maintained inrelative good health for many years withthe aid of dialysis and transplantation.Patients with spinal cord injuries andsevere strokes can now often be restoredto a level of functioning which wouldhave been impossible years ago. Modernburn treatment centers can keep victimsof severe burns alive and can offer re-storative surgery which can in many in-stances erase the after effects of suchburns.These are but a few examples of theimpact which recent progress in scienceand medicine has had. This progress,however, has had another impact. Thesecatastrophic illnesses and injuries whichheretofore would have been rapidly fataland hence not too expensive financially,now have an enormous impact on a fam-ily's finances.To deal with this situation, the com-mittee has added tothe Housebill an amendment which would establish acatastrophic health insurance programbeginning in January 1972 for all peopleunder age 65 who are insured undersocial security, as well as their spousesand minor children. People under 65 whoreceive monthly social security benefitswould also be eligible. People over 65would not be covered since they havemedicare which substantially meets theneeds of all but a very small minority ofbeneficiaries.It is estimated that only 20 to 30 percent of our people under 65 have insur-ance against the costs of catastrophic ill-ness through major medical or compre-hensive medical plans. I am very proudto be the sponsor of this amendmentwhich I believe will go a long way towardslifting the financial burden from thosewho are already carrying the heavy loadof sickness and despair.The benefits provided under the catas-trophic health insurance program wouldbe the same as those currently provided December 16, 1970under parts A and B of medicare, exceptthat there would be no upper limitationson hospital days, extended care facilitydays, or home health visits. The majorbenefits excluded from medicare, andconsequently excluded from this pro-posal, are nursing home care, outpatientprescription drugs, dental care, and fullinpatientandoutpatientpsychiatric coverage.The deductibles in the plan wouldparallel the deductibles under parts Aand B of medicare. There would be ahospital deductible of 60 days' hospi-talization for each person and a supple-mental medical deductible initially es-tablished at $2,000 per family.After an individual is hospitalized for60 days In1year. he would becomeeligible for payments toward his hospitalexpenses beginning on the sixty-first dayof his hospitalization. Any posthospitalextended care services which he sub-sequentlyreceivedduringthatyear would also be eligible for payment. Afterthe hospital deductible is met, the pro-gram would pay hospitals substantiallyas they are presently paid under medi-care, with the individual being respon-sible for a coinsurance payment equal toone-fourth of the inpatient hospital de-ductible as determined for medicare pur-poses. Extended care services would besubject to a daily coinsurance amountequal to one-eighth of the inpatient hos-pital deductible as determined for medi-care purposes. If the program were ineffect in January 1971 the coinsurancefor a hospital day would be $15 a day, aldfor extended care services $7.50 a day.The medical deductible would apply tothe entire family. After a family had in-curred expenses of $2,000 for physicians'bills, home health visits, physical therapyservices, laboratory, and X-ray services,and other covered medical and healthservices, the family would become eligiblefor payments toward these expenses.Alter the $2,000 medical deductible hasbeen met, the program would pay for 80per centum of eligible expenses, with thepatient being responsible for coinsuranceof 20 per centum.As in the medicare program, thesecoinsurance features are intended to lim-it program costs and to control the uti-lization of services.The program would be administeredby using carriers and intermediaries asIn the present medicare program. Medi-care's quality standardg for Institutionswould also apply. Social security, withthe cooperation of carriers and interme-diaries, would determine when the de-ductibles have been satisfied. To keepthe paperwork down, bills would not beaccepted under the supplemental planuntil they totaled $2,000 per family.The committee estimates that morethan 1 million families of the approx-imately49millionfamiliesinthe United States incur medical expenseswhich will qualify them to receive bene-fits under the program. The first year'scost of the program is estimated at $2,-21)0,000,000 on a cash basis. A separatecatastrophic insurance trust fund withits own employer-employee tax wouh beestablished to focus public and congres-sional attention closely on the cost andthe adequacy of the financing of theCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014SENATEprogram. Likethebenefits,the tax would become effective January 1, 1972.For people on public assistance and themedically indigent the catastrophic Ill-ness insurance program would be sup-pleinental to the medicaid program inthe same way that it will be supple-mental to private insurance for other cit-izens. The benefit structure of medicaidvaries from State to State, but In gen-eral it is a basic rather than a catas-trophic benefit package.I want to thank my fellow committeemembers for the very fine cooperationand assistance they have given me onthis amendment. I believe this is a majorstepforwardthatwillbenefitall Americans.FINANACING PROVISIONSAt the present time, the social securitycash benefits program is in close actu-arial balance, while the hospital insur-ance program has an actuarial defi-ciency. Unless hospital insurance taxesare raised substantially, the hospital in-surance trust fund will be exhausted in1972. To meet the cost of the cash bene-fits program as it would be expandedby the bill and to bring the hospital in-surance program into actuarial balance,the contribution rates for the programswould be adjusted and the contributionand benefit base\u2014the maximum amountof annual earnings subject to contribu-tions and used in computing benefits\u2014would be increased.INCREASE IN THE CONTRIBUTION AND BENEFITBASEThe bill provides for an increase inthe ceiling on taxable and creditableearnings to $9,000, effective for 1971. Thisincrease would take account of the in-creases in earnings levels that have oc-curred since 1968, when the $7,800 ceil-ing on earnings went into effect andwould cover the total earnings of an es-timated 79 per centum of all workers\u2014the same percentage as the $7,800 basecovered when it went into effect.People earning amounts between $7,-800 and $9,000 a year will pay taxes onan additional $1,200 of earnings. In re-turn, of course, they will get credit formore earnings and will thus get higherbenefits. The higher creditable earningsresulting from the increase in the ceiling COMMITTEE BILLS 20321on earnings will make possible benefitsthat are more reasonably related to theactual earnings of workers at the higherearnings levels. It the base were to re-main unchanged, more and more work-ers would have earnings above the cred-itable amount and these workers wouldhave benefit protection related toa smaller and smaller part of their fullearnings.CHANGES IN THE CONTRIBUTION RATESUnder the schedule of contributionrates for cash benefits contained in thebill, the contribution rates for employersand employees scheduled for 197 1\u201472 would be decreased from the 4.6 percentum provided for under present lawto 4.4 per centum each.The bill provides for increases in thecontribution rate schedule for the hos-pital insurance program. The contribu-tion rate scheduled for 1971\u201472 wouldbe increased from 0.6 per centum eachfor employees, employers, and the self-employed to 0.8 per centum for 1971\u201472.The additional taxes for this part of theprogram will go far toward removingthe large actuarial deficit of the hos-pital insurance program and would makethat program financially sound.The bill also provides for a contribu-tion rate schedule to fully finance thecatastrophic Illness insurance provisionadded to the bill by the Finance Com-mittee. The contribution rate schedulefor catastrophic illness for 1972\u201474 wouldbe 0.3 per centum each for employees,employers, and the self-employed.For the benefit of Senators and otherswho are concerned with the long-rangefinancing aspects of the social securityanc hospital insurance programs the fol-lowing charts compare the combinedtax rates and maximum tax payableunder the committee bill, the present lawand the House bill. I call attention tothe fact that the rates undev presentlaw applies to maximum earnings of$7,800, while both the House bill andthe committee bill apply to a wage baseof $9,000.I ask unanimous consent that thechart showing the tax rates and maxi-mum taxes be printed in the RECORD.Therebeing no objection, the chartwas ordered to be printed in the RECORD,as follows:SOCIAL SECURITY TAX RATES AND MAXIMUM ANNUAL TAXES UNDER PRESENT LAW, THE HOUSE BILL AND THE PeriodTax rates (percent) Maximum taxesPresent lawHouse bill Committee bill Present lawHouse billCummittee bill EMPLOYER-EMPLOYEE, EACH 197119721973\u20147419751976\u2014791980\u20148519861987 and otter5.25.25.25. 25. 25. 55. 655. 25. 65. 656. 06. 355. 76. 06. 355. 86. 57. 05. 86. me also note for therecord that the combined rate for cashbenefits and hospital Insurance Is the same under the committee bill as underpresent law for 1971 and 1972 and is lessthan present law for 1973 and 1974. Thecatastrophic Insurance tax is a new fea-ture, which of course adds to the rate.We have been assured that the financ-ing provided under the committee bill isadequate to pay for all of the benefits\u2014both the benefits provided under presentlaw and the new benefits provided underthe bill. Moreover, each of the separatetrust funds will be soundly -financod andover the next few years the total incometo the program will be nearly $6,000,000,- FINANCING THE AVTOMATIC PROVISIONMr. LONG. As I mentioned earlier.benefits would be automatically adjustedto take account of Increases in the costof living. The cost of this Increase wouldbe met by increasing both the contri-bution and benefit base and the contri-bution rates so that each increase wouldmeet one-half of the cost. The Secretaryof Health. Education, and Welfare woulddetermine how much the contributionand benefit base would have to be In-creased In order to finance one-half ofthe long-range cost of the proposed ben-efit Increase, and how much contributionrates would have to be increased In orderto finance one-half of the long-rangecost of the proposed benefit increase.The Secretary would then publish In theFederal Register both the new, higherbase and the revised contribution rateschedule, to be effective beginning Janu-ary 1 of the year for which the benefitIncrease Is effective.Mr. President, now let me describethe additional matters contained In thecommittee bill.THE TRADE ACT 0? 5970The committee approved the basicprovisions of the House trade bill as anamendment to H.R. 17550, the socialsecurity legislation. The principal excep-tions concern the export tax Incentivecalled DISC and the repeal of the Ameri-can selling price system of valuation.Now, I will discuss the basic provisionsof the amendment dealing with the for-eign trade which was approved by thecommittee.TRADE AGREEMENT AVFHORITTThe first aspect of the amendmentdeals with the extension of further tariffcutting authority to the President. ThePresident has been without authority toreduce tariffs under the Trade Expan-sion Act since July 1, 1967. This new au-thority would not be used to enter intoanother malor round of trade negotla-CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATE000 more than outgo, as compared withthe more than $21,000,000,000 excess which would accrue under present law.The following table compares the in-come, and outgo, of the social securityfunds over the next 3years underpresent law and under the committee bill.I would point out that under the com-mittee bill, the assets and . thereserve could gradually grow from $44.9 billionto $47 billion in 1973. I ask unanimousconsent that the chart be printed in theRECORD.There being no objection, the chartwas ordered to be printed in the RECORD,as follows: tlons. None are planned. But, there is an-otherreason why thisauthorityis needed. Under the' rules of the game InInternational trade, whenever one coun-try must increase duties or impose quotasin order to protect a domestic industrywhich Is being Injured by imports, thatcountry must also offer compensatorytariff reductions on other Imports ofequivalent value to the country whoseexports would be adversely affected bythe increased duty or quota. The alter-native would be to face retaliation on thepart of those adversely affected coun-tries. It is clear that, under other provi-sions of this bill, the United States willbe Imposing some limited restrictions onthe imports of other countries. For thisreason, it was felt necessary to extend tothe President authority\u2014through July 1,1975\u2014to cut tariffs by 20 percent Intwo stages. The committee made clearthat It does not believe the Presidentshould offer \"compensation\" to coun-tries which themselves have illegal tariffornontarilTbarriersagainstUnited States exports, for which the UnitedStates has not been \"compensated\". Inother words,inthose situations weshould go to the bargaining table andwork out a mutually satisfactory solu-tion to the question .f compensation.REVISE UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICE STATUTESThe trade bill also deais with threeunfair trade practice statutes. It revisessectjon 252 of the Trade Expansion Actto give the President further authoritytocope withforeignnontariffbar-riersrestrictingU.S.exportsInIn- dustrial as well as agricultural trade.This is what he asked for and the reasonIs this: Under present law, the authorityIs confined mainly to agricultural prod-ucts. This additional authority, requestedby the administration, will strengthenthe President's hands in negotiatingnontartif barriers with other countries.It will serve 85aclear warning that theUnited States is no longer able to turnDecember 16, 1970the other cheek when foreign countriesimpose new nontariff barriers againstU.s. products.In addition, the Senate amendmentagrees with the House that in antidump-ing and countervailing duty cases, theTreasury should have some time limitsimposed upon it in making its determi-nation regarding the imports Involved.The Antidumping Act deals with injuri-ous price discrimination, and counter-vailing duty statute deals with foreignsubsidies. In the case of the antidump-ing statute, the Treasury would have4 months to reach a tentative deci-sion on the question of whether or notthere has been price discrimination, ex-cept in extraordinarily complicated casesin which the Secretary may take up to7 months. In cases under the coun-tervailing duty statutes, the Secretaryof the Treasury would have 1 year tomake decisions. Both the House andt.he Senate committee agree that thesetime limits will give assurance that de-cisions will be reached promptly on mat-tersofvitalconcerntodomesticindustry.REVISED ESCAPE CLAUSE AND ADJUSTMENTASSISTANCE PROVISIONA third major area which the com-mittee dealt with was In revising thestringent criteria in present law for pro-viding adjustment assistance and tariffadjustment(escapeclause)reliefto firms, workers, and Industries which areseriously injured by import competition.With respect to the escape clause whichdeals with Industrywide injury, presentlaw provides that tariff concessions mustbe found to be the major cause of in-creased imports, and increased importsmust be found to be the major factor incausing serious injury. These two testshave proven so difficult that only one in-dustry out of over 20 applicants hasqualified for relief since 1962. The ex-ecutive branch agrees that these testsare too rigid.The Finance Committee substantiallyaltered both tests to make it easier for alomestic industry to receive relief. TheSenate amendment would require thatincreased imports must be related Inwhole or in part to tariff concessions.This was the same test that existed for11years from 1951to1962, andit worked well. The committee agrees withthe House that a \"substantial cause\" re-lationship between increased imports andserious Injury was fairer to all than ei-ther the present law or the administra-tion's recommendation, of substitutingthe concept of \"primary\" cause for \"ma-jor\" cause in the statute.The committee considered that the \"es-cape clause\" had a substantial cause-testfor11years, between 1951 and1962, and it also worked well. We did notfeel that another possible misinterpre-tation of our Intention by using the word\"primary\" Instead of \"major\" would beworth risking. In fact, It appears thereIs a distinction without a difference in thetwo terms.The committee also felt that the defini-tion of industry should permit separateconsideration to be given to those seg-ments of a multiproduct corporation forproducing one product which mIght beseriously Injured by Imports, even thoughPROGRESS OF THE OLD-AGE AND SURVIVORS INSURANCE. DISABILITY INSURANCE. HOSPITAL INSURANCE. ANDCATASTROPHIC INSURANCE TRUST FUNDS, COMBINED, UNDER PRESENT LAW AND UNDER FINANCE COMMITTEE BILL, 1971\u201473 ICash 16, 1970other product areas may not be. This iscalled the \"segmentation principle\" andIt too was on the books for 11 yearswithout any difficulties between 1951 and1962.Another area in the escape clause whichthe committee did take action on andwhich is new, and that is the so-called\"acute or severe\" injury test. Under thecommittee's amendment, the Tariff Com-mission must determine whether on thebasis of the substantial cause-test an in-dustry is being seriously injured by im-ports. That wouJd be the first finding.Having made that determination and as-suming it was positive, the Commission-ers finding serious injury would also de-termine whether the injury was acute orsevere. The term \"acute or severe\" de-note a degree of injury which is a levelhigher than serious injury and whichcould,ifnot immediatelycorrected, threaten the very existence of an indus-try as a viable economic entity in theUnited States. Now, under either the ini-tial determination of serious injury or thesubsequent acute or severe injury deter-mination, the Tariff Commission wouldrecommend a remedy. If only the initialserious injury was found, the Presidentwould consider the remedy suggested bythe Tariff Commission but would be al-lowed to proclaim any import restrictionhe deemed necessary to prevent seriousInjury, unless he determines it is not inthe national interest to impose such re-strictions. In the latter case, he mustprovide adjustment assistance to thosefirms and workers which are being seri-ously injured. If there are two affirina-tive findings by the Tariff Commission\u2014one of serious injury and another ofacute or severe injury\u2014the Presidentwould have to impose the remedy recom-mended by a majority of the Tariff Com-mission making those determinations,unless he determines it is not in the na-tional interest to do so. In other words,the second test puts a little more pressureon the President to accept the TariffCommission's findings, but the Presidentretains his flexibility. But if he does notaccept the Tariff Commission's recom-mendation he must nevertheless provideadjustment assistance. The committeedeemed that this flexibility was neces-sary.With respect to adjustment assistance,It is only necessary to determine thatimports are contributing to unemploy-ment or underemployment in the case ofgroups of workers, or to serious injuryin the case of firms.TxXTILES AND FOOTWEARNow let me turn to the textile and foot-wear provisions in the bill.The textile industryisthe largestmanufacturing industry in the UnitedStates with 2.1 million employees, manyof them disadvantaged. The industrymoved from the North to the South, andnow may move across the Pacific unlessrelief from low-wage imports is provided.All the European countries have nego-tiated voluntary agreements with Japanand other Asian textile producers to limitimports of manmade fiber and woolentextiles into the European market. Thatis the in tent of this bill. The United Stateshas been striving to obtain a similarCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014SENATEagreement, because we have become the\"dumping ground\" for cheap imports,and our producers are facing severe hard-ships. But the Japanese do not appearwilling to give us the same considerationthat they gave the Europeans.The nonrubber footwear industry hasalso been hurt by growing imports. Thus,the bill provides for quantative limita-tions on the imports of certain textileand footwear articles equal to the averageannual imports for the 3 calendar years,1967 through 1969.However, there is a great deal of flex-ibility in the bill. For example, the Pres-ident is authorized to exempt any prod-ucts from the statutory import quotas:First, which he determines are not dis-rupting the United States market, sec-ond, when he determines that the na-tional interest requires such action, and,third, when the supply of any article inthe domestic market isinsufficient tomeet the demand at reasonable prices, or,fourth, when voluntary agreements areenteredintowithforeign producingcountries.The President is specifically authorizedto negotiate agreements with foreigncountries under which imports of textileand footwear articles would be volunta-rily controlled. As I have stated importscovered by such voluntary agreementswould be exempt from the mandatoryquota provisions of the bill. The mainthrust of the legislation, therefore, is toshare our market with foreign goods,hopefully on a voluntary basis, so thatindustry and labor would not be severelyinjured by foreign competition.Textile and footwear imports into theUnited States have been Increasing very rapidly. The average imports of man- made fiber amounted to 1,390 millionsquare yards in the 1967\u201469 base pe-riod, and for wool textile products it was 184.5 million square yards. As of June1970, imports of manmade fiber textilesare running at an alltime record of 2.4billion square yards. Apparel imports are also sharply up, and in some productareas, such as sweaters and shirts, im-ports have practically taken over themarket. For example, in 1965 imports ofsweaters of manmade fiber were 501,000dozen. In 1969, imports of such sweatershad increased to 6,974,000 dozen. Thatis more than a tenfold Increase in thespace of 4years. Such increases Inimports year after year are devastatingour textile and apparel firms. Many re-sponsible Individuals realize this. In an article appearing In the September issueof Fortune magazine the former Ministerof Finance in Japan, the Honorable No-butane Kuichi made this wise statement:Confrontation between us and the worldis no good. I'd like to see the growth-rate ofour exports decline from last year's 22 per-cent to no more than 10 percent, ideally 7percent. I have told this to the Prime Min-ister and he doesn't like it because every-thing Is geared to exports.Let us not forget that other countrieshaving much more severe barriers toimports than the United States, face thesame problems. Japan, for example, hasquotas on 98 products. Western Eu-rope controls its imports through bordertaxes and variable levies, and, in ad-S 20323dition, has quantitative restrictions onJapanese and other Asian textile prod-ucts, which serve to divert them to theUnited States. For example, this Nationabsorbs50percentofJapan'sap- parel exports; all Western Europe, withmore than our population, absorbs only5 percent.Under these circumstances, they shouldnot point their finger at us as startinga trade war. We do not want a trade war.But we cannot stand idly by and watchour industries go under and our laborforce decimated by foreign Imports whilenothing is done. These provisions will In-sure that American industry and Alneri-can jobs will be protected in a reasonableway while, at the same time, insuring anequitable share of our market for foreigngoods.NATIONAL SECuRITy PROVISIONAnother area covered by this bill Is therevision of the national security provi-sion of the Trade Expansion Act. Underthe present law, if the Director of theOffice of Emergency Preparedness makesa finding that imports of a particular ar-ticle are threatening to impair the na- tional security, he shall so report to thePresident. If the President agrees withthis finding, he shall impose whateverrestrictions he deems necessary to rem-edy the situation.The House believed, and the FinanceCommittee concurs that wherever na- tional security findings are involved, a quota would be a more suitable devicefor controlling imports than a tariff.In the first place, the quota would pro- vide assurance that Imports could bekept at a level consonant with the na- tional security objectives, whereas no tariff could give that assurance.If the tariff were set too low, importswould come pouring In to depress our market; if the tariff was very high, itcould shut off Imports completely or in- volve very high costs to the U.S. con- sumer. In the case of oil, there is theadditionalproblemoftankerrates, which are extremely volatile. A tariffset on Monday might be inappropriate onFriday if tanker rates had moved up sharply in the meantime. We cannotadjust our tariffs to accommodate thefickle nature of these tanker rate varia-tions, or to the whims of Arab potentateswho have effective control over prices.TheDirectoroftheOfficeof Emergency Preparedness stated beforethe Finance Commit that a tariffwould tend to Increase the cost of oilto the consumer much more than a quota. The Secretary of State, the Secre-tary of Defense, the Secretary of theTreasury, the Secretary of Commerce,and the Director of the Office of Emer-gency Preparedness all agree that a tariff is not a suitable instrument forcontrollingoilimports, and have soadvised the President. The Presidenthas accepted that recommendation Thecommittee billreflects the same con-elusion.WELFARE AMENDMENTSINTRODUCTIONThe goal of working out progressiveand productive proposals in the area ofpublic welfare has occupied the commit-tee for many months. S 20324Lookingat the overall structure of ourpublic assistance system, the committeeconcluded that two different approacheswere called for. First, there is no pressingneed to throw out completely our presentprograms for the aged, blind, and dis-abled and start a new program in thatarea. These programs, on the whole, havebeen working well. They have been re-sponsive to the needs of poor people, andthe rolls have remained fairly steady.The committee therefore determined tomake desirable improvements in theseprograms, but not at this time to changetheir basic direction.The situation with regard to the pro-gram of aid to families with dependentchildren is far different. The AFDC case-load has tripled in the last 10 years, andwe now have approximately 9 millionAFDC recipient.s throughout the coun-try. The rate of growth is continuing un-abated, and every State is feeling theconsequences. Equally disturbing is thenature of the growth in the program.Most of the families being added to therolls are eligible because of the absenceof the father from the home. These arecases largely resulting from desertion,separation, and illegitimacy. Fully three-fourths of the families now receivingAFDC are families In which the fatherIs absent, and this percentage will beincreasing if present trends continue.Faced with this situation, the commit-tee felt compelled to develop workableand greatly needed improvements Inthose programs created by the Congressto help AFDC families and to get at theroot cause of dependency. The bill wouldmake possible Immediate improvement Inthe work Incentive and child care pro-grams, thus assisting many families tomove toward economic Independence.Along with these proposals to solve prob-lems which are amenable to rapid im-provement, the committee is advocatinga broad program of testing which Isaimed at finding long-range solutions tothe overall problem of welfare depend-ency.At this point I would like to describeIn greater detail just what the commit-tee bill Includes.ASSISTANCE TO THEAGED,BLIND, AND DISABLEDFirst of all, the bill proposes a nationalminimum income level which would pro-vide a considerably higher level of assist-arice for a large percentage of recipientsof aid to the aged, blind, and disabled.Many of these people, who are amongthe most hopeless and helpless of all thepoor in our country, are currently re-ceiving assistance which is obviously in-adequate for their needs.We think it Is urgent that increasedassistance be given to those who are liv-ing in States where payments are verylow. Thus, the bill would require Statesto provide a level of assistance sufficientto assure persons in these categories atotal monthly Income of at least $130 fora single person, or $200 for a couple.States would, of course, have the optionof maintaining or establishing a higherstandard for residents of their State.To give some Idea of the impact of thisnew minimum, let me point out that Inthe aged category, this provision wouldresult In increased asistance for eligibleCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEsingle-agedIndividualsinabout31 States, and for eligible aged couples Inabout 36 States.The committee bill would also, in ef-fect, give needy persons in the adultcategories more money In lieu of foodstamps. We all know that many of themhave suffered loss of dignity and pride byhaving to use food stamps when they goout to the local grocery store to do theirshopping. This bill will give them cash.which they can use as they want, andwhen they want.In addition, the committee wanted tomake sure that those social security ben-eficiaries who are also public assistancerecipients would share in the benefit ofthe social security increases which areprovided in the bill. If present law re-mained unchanged, any increase in a so-cial security check would mean an off-setting decrease in the recipient's publicassistance check. Therefore, the com-mittee bill requires States to raise theirstandards of need for those in the aged,blind, and disabled categories by $10 permonth for a single individual, and $15for a couple. These recipients would inthis way be guaranteed an increase intotal Income of at least these amounts.Recognizing that the rapid growth Inwelfare expenditures in recent years hasstrained thefiscalcapacitiesofthe States, the committee wanted to makesure that the States would not have tobear any additional costs resulting fromthese new benefits in the adult cate-gories. A certain amount of fiscal reliefwill accrue to the States to the extentthat welfare grants are reduced becauseof the increases which the bill providesin social security benefits. However, thisrelief Is not necessarily distributed In away which reflects the relative welfareburdens of the States under present lawor under the additional requirements im-posed by the bill.We have worked out a proposal which.generallyspeaking, would assureall States a 10-percent savings over theirexpenditures for adult assistance pro-grams In 1970. The Federal Governmentwould pay 100 percent of the cost of ad-ditional expenditures for the aged, blind,and disabled which are required by thecommittee bill.Mr. President, it Is my belief that thesechanges proposed In the bill will be ofenormous benefit to those Americans whoare in need because o old age, blindness,or other crippling disability. We havebeen able to work out a way of increas-ing the minimum income level above the$110 per person level proposed by theadministration and approved by theHouse, and to make other needed im-provements, without going above theamountswhichtheadministrationstated it was willing to allocate for thesecategories of assistance.TESTING OP WELTARE ALTERNATtVESNow let me turn to the problem of as-sistance to needy families with children.I have already outlined, and there is noneed to further document, the serious-ness of the growth In the AFDC program.The committee has studied the presentprogram. It has studied the proposal.with Its many variations, which the ad-ministration made for the establishmentDecember 16, 1970of a new family assistance plan to besuperimposed on the AFDC program.In all honesty and sincerity, I wouldsay that the committee shares the viewof Governor Hearnes of Missouri, whotestified during the hearings on FAP.Governor Hearnes summed up his ownopinion by stating quite seriously that ifyou read what the newspapers said aboutthe proposal, you would be for it, but ifyou read what was actually in the bill,you had to be against It.We read the administration's bill. Wehad many weeks of public hearings on it.Nearly everyone who testified endorsedthe principles In the proposal, but nearlyall the witnesses also pointed out weak-nesses.As legislators, we know that the per-fect law is yet to be written. We wouldnot reject a proposal because of minorproblems or oversights. These, we know,can be corrected in the course of time.But when a proposal establishes a newdirection,andgoalsareestablishedwhich in our honest evaluation are un-attainable under the measures provided,then it is our responsibility to require amore thorough examination.The committee bill would thus requirethe Secretary of Health, Education, andWelfare to conduct up to five tests ofpossible alternatives to the AFDC pro-gram. One or two of these tests wouldtest a 'farni1y assistance\" type proposalfor welfare, and one or two of the testswould test a \"workfare\" type proposal.In addition, the bill provides for a testin which a program of rehabilitation ofwelfare recipients would be administeredby vocational rehabilitation personnel.It is my hope, and the hope of thecommittee, that these tests would providea sound basis for rational legislative ac-tion in the welfare area. We would alsohope that each test would produce datafrom which there could be estimated forthe various types of programs the cost.extent of participation, and effectivenessIn reducing dependency on welfare w1ichcould be expected if such programs wereadopted as a substitute for AFDC. Thetests should also provide valuable admin-istrative experience which would facili-tate the Implementation of any of thetest proposals which might eventuallybe enacted.The bill would give the Department ofHealth, Education, and Welfare flexibil-ity in choosing the areas in which thetests are to be conducted. However, itwould require that the areas chosenshould be broadly representative of thecountry as a whole so that the data fromthe tests may serve as a reliable basis forfuture congressional action.The tests are also to be conducted insuch a way that valid comparisonsamong the various alternatives can bemade. The bill therefore requires thatthe Department conduct the same num-be'r of \"workfare\" tests as \"family assist-ance\" tests\u2014either one or two of each.In each pair of tests the beginning andending dates of the two tests must be thesame, the number of participants mustbe approximately the same, and theareas in which the two tests are con-ducted must be comparable as to popu- December 16, 1970lation, per capita Income, unemploymentlevel, and other relevant factors.Tests would have to be conducted withState cooperation and with State shar-ing in the costs of the tests.At all stages in the development ofthe tests and in their operation, thecommittee would be kept advised and theComptroller General would be consultedregarding testing procedures that wouldbe utilized.Two matters that this Senator wouldlike to see developed by these tests arewhether wage subsidies are one effectiveway of increasing the incomes of thedisadvantaged and whether, if they are,the one-check or the two-check ap-proach is preferable. The one-check ap-proach involves passing the subsidy tothe employer who includes It in his wageto the worker. The two-check approachenvisions a wage supplrmented by a pay-ment directly from the welfare office.Mr. President, we believe this programof testing is both a responsible and aresponsive way of meeting our presentwelfare crisis. We agree that the presentsystem Is bad, but we do not agree thatIt is so bad that any untested alternativewould be preferable merely because itIs new or different. We want to find somereal answers to the welfare problem. Andwe believe that the way to do this isthrough careful experimentation.At the same time, we recognize thatthere are changes in the present legisla-tion which should be made immediately,and we seek in the bill to correct someof the wprst and most obvious defects.WORI< INCENTIVE PROGRAMThe committee and the administrationare in substantial agreement as to theobligation of a.pnropriate welfare recipi-ents to work. The thrust of any welfarereform proposal must encompass thebasic proposition that able-bodied wel-fare recipients should be required to work if child care and meaningful man-power training are provided\u2014and thatactual jobs must be available for suchpeople after training.Mr. President, I think the Congresshas now reached the point where it isreluctant to support any more trainingprograms. that do not result in jobs forparticipants. Moreover, the disadvan-taged people of this country share thisdisenchantment\u2014they say in increasingnumbers \"no more training programswithout jobs.\"The committee bill adopts almost allof the administration's requests for im-provement of the work incentive pro-gram. It provides more favorable match-ing for manpower training expenses andfor welfare services which support train-ing, including the vitally important daycare. It also provides registration withthe employment service as a conditionof welfare eligibility and puts into effectuniform Federal standards for referralof welfare recipients to WIN. All of theseelements have been cited by the admin-istration as crucial deficiencies in thework incentive program.But the bill goes further\u2014and here,I would be remiss in not pointing to thegreat contributions of the junior Senatorfrom Georgia, Senator TALMADGE. ItCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEcomes to grips with some of the basicreasons for the failure of WIN whichhave been very disturbing to the com-mittee. The Cqmmittee on Finance wasthe principal architect of the WIN pro-gram\u2014I believe I was the initial sponsorof that amendment\u2014and was responsiblefor the basic decision\u2014that the Depart-ment of Labor would administer themanpower training program. However,the committee has been greatly disap-pointed in the implementation of theprogram.The points of emphasis the FinanceCommittee thought were made abun-dantly clear in the 1967 amendmentshave been paid lipservice or totally ig-nored. A meaningful program of on-the-job training continues to be an unful-filled Labor Department promise. Thelegally required program of special workprojects\u2014public service employment\u2014isa reality in only one State. Lack of LaborDepartment and Department of Health,Education, and Welfare cooperation andthat of their counterparts at the locallevel has been a major problem in thereferral process and in the provision ofnecessary supportive services for recip-ients in work and training. The mainthrust of the WIN program as it existstoday remains In the direction of basiceducation and classroom training, whichour experience with manpower trainingover the last decade shows does not re-suit in the placement of people in jobs,but rather in a growing skepticism ofboth welfare recipients and the publicas to the worth of such endeavors.Mr.President,thissituation mustchange. More effective administrationmust be provided, and WIN's on-the-jobtraining and public service employmentcomponents must become a vital part ofthe program.It is for this reason the committee billincludes a provision which would requireheavy emphasis on these two compo-nents. Also, a tax credit mechanism isprovided which will link manpower train-ing to the actual provision of jobs.I might say there has been a severedisappointment in the performance ofthe Department of Labor in accordancewith its duties under the law..The task of training welfare recipientsfor jobs and actually placing them inemployment on a permanent basis is ad-mittedly one of the most difficult tasksfacingGovernment.Thecommittee believes that the changes it is proposingfor WIN are important, albeit some ofthese could have been made withoutchanges in the. statute. But we are alsoaware that regardless of what the Con-gress does in this area the ultimate suc-cess of the program will, in large meas-ure, be dependent on the dedication ofadministrators at the Federal, State, andlocal level and the resources they areallocated. Thus, we believe it is incum-bent upon the Department of Labor toshow its commitment to WIN and toprovidestaffingat the Federal levelwhich is commensurate with its respon-sibilities as the primary administrator ofthe program. The WIN program mustreceive the kind of implementation itsimportance deserves.CHILD CAREThe bill also includes proposals whichwould greatly expand the availability ofchild care resources throughout the Na-tion. At the present time the lack of ade-quate child care represents perhaps thesingle largest impediment to the effortsof poor families, especially those headedby a mother, to achieve economic inde-pendence. The committee bill would seekto remove this impediment fo the poor,while at the same time promoting childcare facilities for all families which needthem, by creating a Federal Child CareCorporation.Although the Committee on Financeand the Congress, through past amend-ments to the Social Security Act, haveattempted to meet the need for childcare we have been unable to overcomethe great lack of organization, initiative,and know-how which exists in the childcare area. We have provided money, butwe have found that money alone will notdo the job. We need a mechanism at theFederal, State, and local levels whichwill respond to both national and localneeds for child care. We believe the Fed-eral Child Care Corporation will be sucha mechanism.The Corporation would have as its firstpriority making available child care serv-ices to children of parents eligible forsuch services under the AFDC program,and who need them in order to partici-pate in employment or training. However,it would also have the broader functionof making child care available for anyfamily which may need it, regardless ofwelfare status.The Corporation .would work in anuncomplicated way. Under the commit-tee bill, $50 million would be given to theCorporation to provide initial workingcapital. This amount would be in theform of a loan by the Secretary of theTreasury and would be placed In a re-volving fund. The money would be usedby the Corporation to begin arranging forchild care services. Initially, the Corpo-ration would contract with existing pub-lic,private nonprofit, and proprietaryfacilities to serve as child care providers.To expandservices,the Corporationwould also give technical assistance andadvice to organizations interested in es-tablishing facilities under contract withthe Ccrporation. In addition, the Corpo-ration could provide child care services inits own facilities.Fees would be charged for all servicesprovided or arranged for by the Corpora-tion. The fees would go into the revolvingfund to provide capital for further devel-opment of services and to repay the ini-tial loan. They would be set at a levelwhich would cover the costs to the Cor-poration of arranging child care.We have provided in the bill for con-struction authority for the Corporation,and would authorize the issuance ofbonds for this purpose if new construc-tion is needed. We envisage, however,that this authority will be used sparingly,and that every effort will first be madeto utilize existing facilities.I am deeply concerned about the qual-ity of care which children are to receive,and I therefore want to emphasize thatS 20325 S 20326the bill includes provision for Federalchild care standards, to assure that ade-quate space, staff, and health require-ments are met. In addition, facilities usedby the Corporation would have to meetthe Life Safety Code of the National FireProtection Association.The bill includes inservice training au-thority, and the committee expects thatthis authority, along with the trainingprograms under the WIN program, willbe used to train welfare mothers, inso-far as possible, to work in child care pro-grams. This will mean that while somemothers are being freed for work, otherswill be provided employment directly inchild care facilities.The Corporation, while providing amechanism for expanding the availabil-ity of child care services, would not pro-vide funds to subsidize child care. Thosewho are able to pay would be charged thefull cost of services. The cost of childcare needed by families on welfare wouldbe paid by State welfare agencies.Here, too, the committee bill makes asignificant improvement in present lawby providing for an increase from 75 per-cent to 90 percent in the Federal match-ing share for child care services. The billwould authorize payment of 100 percentof the cost of services for a temporaryperiod if the Secretary determined thatnecessary services would not otherwisebe available. The 90 percent matchingrate would be available to the States forchild care for families receiving AFDCandalsoforpastandpotentialrecipients.FAMILY PLANNING SERVICESMr. President, the committee bill pro-vides for a major advance in enablingwelfare recipients to obtain free familyplanning services by authorizing 100 per-cent Federal funding for State familyplanning programs, including both in-formation and the provision of medicalservices.As under present law, States would berequired to offer family planning servicesto all appropriate recipients of AFDC, in-cluding, on an optional basis, former re-cipients and those who are likely to be-come recipients of welfare. Acceptance ofservices, as under present law, would bevoluntary with the recipient.A beginning has been made as the re-suit ofcongressional action in 1967 when'75 percent Federal matching funds wasauthorized for this purpose. The progresswhich hasbeen made imderthose amendments, however, has not met thecommittee's expectations.The provisions of the committee billare consistent with the aims of the ad-ministration, as expressed by the Presi-dent in a speech in July 969:Most of an estimated five million low in-come women of childbearing age in thiscountry do not have adequate access tofamily planning assistance, even though theirwishes concerning family size are usually thesame as those of parents of higher Incomegroups.It is my view that no American womanshould be denied access to family planningassistance because of her economic condi-tion. I believe, therefore, that we should es-tablish as a national goal the provision ofadequate family planning services within thenext five years to all those who want thembut cannot afford them. This we have thecapacity to do.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEThe committee shares the goal of thePresident and believes that this is anappropriate step in its fulfillment. Itnotes that, according to testimony ofPlanned Parenthood Federation, fullfamily planning services can be providedfor about $60 per woman per year. Thisseems a small price to pay for the per-sonal,social,and economicbenefits which can be achieved as the result of aneffective nationwide family planning pro-gram.EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE TO MIGRANT FAMILIESSome of the most disadvantaged citi-zens in our country can be found amongmigrant workers. When children are in-volved, the situation calls even moreurgently for action, and this action mustbe of a national nature which is com-mensurate with the national problem.Under existing law, emergency assist-ance may, at the option of the States, beprovided to needy migrant families withchildren and be provided either state-wide or in part of the State. Fifty per-cent Federal matching is provided.The committee bill establishes a moremeaningful program by amending exist-ing law: first, to require all States to pro-vide such a program; second, to requirethat it be statewide in application; and,third, to provide Federal matching of itscost at the 75 percent level.OBLIGATIONS OF DESERTING FATHERMr. President, when we discuss wel-fare reform, we should always remem-ber some of the root causes of the pres-ent crisis.The facts are startiing:In 1969, three out of four families re-ceiving AFDC were eligible because ofthe father's absence from the home.Think of that\u201475 percent. One out of sixfamilies is on welfare because of thefather's desertion. With about 9 mil-lion AFDC recipients, this means thatabout 1,500,000 mothers and childrenare receiving welfare today because thefather of the family has deserted.An illustration of the impact of de-sertion on a city's AFDC rolls is NewYork where between 1961 and 1968 thecases of deserted or informally sepa-rated wives grew by 412 percent.Nationally, the largest single cause ofdependency among children is illegiti-macy. In 28 percent of the families re-ceiving AFDC, the mother is not marriedto the father of the child.Congress,particularlyinthe1967 amendments, attempted to deal with thisaspectofthedependencyproblem. These measures, however, have failed tostem the explosive growth of the welfarerolls in the past 3 years, a growth largelyconsisting of families in which thereeither never was a father or in whichthe father has deserted the family or isotherwise separated from the mother.During the hearings on the welfarebill, Secretary Richardson was asked hisopinion about direct Federal action indesertion cases. He replied:We would support legislation which madeIt a Federal crime to cross State lines for thepurposeofevadingparentalresponsibil-Ity.'** Fromthe standpoint of our De-partment to make thisa Federal crimewould help to reduce the problem, we think,and to that extent we would be for It.December 16, 1970The committee considers the provi-sions of present law useful and feels theyshould be retained. However, it is clearthat further action is necessary to per-mit more extensive involvement of theFederal Government in cases where thefather is able to avoid his parental re-sponsibilities by crossing State lines.Thus, the committee bill would makeit a Federal misdemeanor for a fatherto cross State lines in order to avoid hisfamily responsibilities. The penalty un-der this new amendment would be im-prisonment for up to 1 year.Second, the committee bill wOuld pro-vide that an individual who has desertedor abandoned his spouse, child, or chil-dren shall owe a monetary obligationto the United States equal to the Federalshare of any welfare payments made tothe sopuse or child during the period ofdesertion or abandonment.The bill also provides that Informationregarding the whereabouts of the desert-ing individual would be furnished, onrequest, by the Federal Government tothe deserted spouse where a judgmentfor support has been obtained.Daniel P. Moynihan has stated:Now,aworking-classormiddle-class American who chooses to leave his family Isnormally required first to go through elab-.orate legal proceedings and thereafter todevote much of his Income to supportiligthem. Normally speaking, society gives himnothing. The fathers of AFDC families, how-ever, simply disappear. Only a person Invin-cibly prejudiced on behalf of the poor woulddeny that there are attractions in such free-dom of movement.It is my hope that the measures con-tained in the committee biL will equatethe responsibilities of a father of APDCchildren with those of the father of aworking-class or middle-class'family.THE couR'r AND WELFARE LAWSome major changes in welfare lawhave been' made in recent years not bythe Congress, but by the Judiciary, Thesedecisions have played a major role in thephenonmenal growth of the welfare rollsin the last 3 years. In some cases, theCourt decisions have been made on thebasis of an interpretation of congres-sional Intent and in some cases the de-cision has been based on an Interpreta-tion of the Constitution. Cothmon tomany of these cases seems to be an as-sumption that welfare is a \"propertyright\" rather than a \"gratuity\" grantedas a privilege by the Congress and sub-ject to such eligirnlity conditions as theCongress, through the legislative process,decides to impose:Health, Education, and Welfare Secre-tary Elliot L. Richardson disagrees withthis view of welfare as a vested right.Under Secretary Veneman disagrees withthis view. The Committee on Financedisagrees with this view. Underlying thecommittee'sactiononthewelfareamendments in the bill is the funda-mental policy that the \"right to welfare\"is a statutory right, dependent on legis-lation enacted by the Congress, and nota vested, Inherent, or inalienable rightto benefits.The committee's view is that the rightto welfare Is no more substantial, andhas no more legal effect, than any otherbenefit conferred by a generous legisla-ture. The welfare system as we know It December 16, 1970today isauthorized under the SocialSecurity Act, and the statutory rightsgranted under that act can be extended,restricted,altered, amended, or evenrepealed by the Congress. It is this abilityto change the nature of a statutory rightwhich distinguishes it from a propertyright or any other right considered In-violate under the Constitution.Consistent with this view the commit..tee bill includes provisions reassertingthe intent of Congress with respect to theresidency requirements, the man in thehouse rules, payments. of welfare bene-fits during appeals, the requirement thatStates seek to establish the paternity ofIllegitimate children applying for wel-fare and allowing caseworkers to enterthe home of welfare recipients at reason-able times and with reasonable notice.In addition the bill would prevent theuse of Federal funds in financing futureeffortsto nullify any feature of theSocial Security Act.TAX AMENDMENTSThis billalso contains several taxamendments closely related to the pro-grams dealt with by the bill.INFORMATION REPORTINGAn Important feature of the commit-tee bill is the provision calling for infor-mation reports to be submitted to theInternal Revenue Service of paymentsmade by insurance companies to healthcare providers. In the case of federallyfinanced health programs like medicareand medicaid the amendment calls forreports both of payments made direct tothe provider and those made to the ben-eficiary in reimbursement of his bills. In the case of private insurance policies,however, the amendment would requirereporting only of payments made directto the provider.BRIBES AND KICKBACKSAnother committee amendment cor-rects an unintended effect of the TaxReform Act of 1969 allowing a tax de-duction for illegal bribes and kickbacks.The 1969 Act required that there be acriminal Conviction or guilty plea beforesuch a payment could be disallowed. Thecommittee bill substantially restores theprior law and disallows a deduction Ifthe payment is illegal under Federal orState law. This disallowance rule also ap-plies to medical referral fees under themedicare and medicaid programs sinceanother provision in the bill makes suchpayments illegal.RETIREMENT INCOME CREDITThe committee bill re!iefprovision forretired persons\u2014by in-creasing the amount of retirement in-come eligible for the credit. This action,together with the recent announcementby the Internal Revenue Service that itwould compute the retirement Incomecreditforpersonswhorequestit, should go far toward making this creditgenerally more useful.Mr. President, in connection with that,I want to give credit to the Senator fromConnecticut (Mr. RIBIC0FF) for his dili-gence In this area in assuring that anadequate tax relief provision for retiredpersons would be a provision of the bill.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEWORK INCENTIVE TAX CREDITAnother amendment recommended bythe committee provides f or a tax creditfor employers of persons trained or placed through the work incentive pro-gram. The tax credit will amount to 20percent of the employee's salary for the first year of employment, but itwould be recaptured ifthe employeeshould be dischargedinthefirst2 years of employment. The committee feltthat this amendment, part of a compre-hensive revision of the work incentiveprogram, would stimulate jobs for peoplewho today must depend on the welfaresystem for their sustenance.VETERANS PENSION INCREASE.The Committee on Finance, in its de-liberation on this bill, has continued, asin the past, to be mindful of the specialneeds of veterans. The committee billincludes the text of S. 3385, a pensionincrease bill introduced by Senator HER-MAN E. TALMADGE, chairman of the Sub-committee on Veterans' Legislation. TheTalmadge bill, Incorporated as a com-mitteeamendment,wouldincrease pension benefits by $160,000,000 abovepresent law, effective January 1971.Pension benefits are related to need.As socialsecurity payments arein- creased, the veterans need for a pensiondecreases, although by a considerablysmaller amount than the rise in socialsecurity benefits. The committee amend-ments substantially offset these reduc-tions.CONCLUSIONMr. President this concludes my pre-pared statement on the committee bill.I urge that it be approved.Iask unanimous consent tohave printed in the RECORD a summary of theprincipal provision of the bill.There being no objection, the sum-mary was ordered to be printed in theRECORD, as follows:II. SUMMARY OP PRINCIPAL PROVISIONS OF THEBn.x.A. SOCIAL SECURITY CASH BENEFITS1. ProvisIons of the House bill changed, andnew provisions added by the committeeThe committee made a number of changesin the provisions of the House-pa.sseci billaffectingthesocialsecurityCashbene- fit programs. In a number of eases, the com-mitteebillwouldmodifyoreliminate provisions of the House bill affecting selectgroups of beneficiaries: these changes wouldhelp make possible a 10-percent across-the-board benefit increase compared with the5-percent increase in the 1-louse bill. Otherprovisions In the committee bill include a$100 minimum benefit, an increase In thebenefits for widows and widowers, an age-62 Computation point for men, liberalizationof the retirement test, an increase In themaximum benefits payable to a family, areduction in the waiting period for disabil-ity benefits, and other less far-reaching butnonetheless important changes.Increase in Social Security BenefitsSocial security payments to the nearly 26million beneficiaries on the rolls at the endof January 1971. and to those who come onthe rolls after that date, would be increasedby 10 percent, with a new minimum benefitof $100. (The House-passed bill would haveincreased benefits by 5 percent, with a mm-ixnum benefit of $67.20.)The benefit Increase would be effective forthe month oX January 1971, but would not beS 20327paid until April, and would mean addi-tional benefit payments of $5.0 billion in thefirst full year.Increased Widows' and Widowers' InsuranceBenefitsUnder present law, when benefits beginat or after age 62 the benefit for a widow(or dependent widower)Is equal to 82y2percent of the amount the deceased workerwould have received If his benefit had startedwhen he was age 65. A widow can get abenefit at age 60 reduced to take account cfthe additional 2 years in which she wouldbe getting benefits.Both the House bill and the Committeebillare aimed at providing benefits to awidow equal to the benefits her husband wasreceiving, or would have received, It wasbrought to the committee's attention, how-ever, that in some cases the widow, underthe House bill,would actually receive abenefit substantially higher than her hus-band received before his death. Under theHouse bill, a widow would be entitled to100% of the amount her deceased husbandwould receiveif he became a beneficiaryafter reaching age 65. On the other hand,if he actually began receiving benefits beforereaching age 65, his benefits would be ac-tuarially reduced. For example, a man eli-gible for $150 monthly if he retires at age65 will receive reduced benefits of $135 whenhe retires 18 months before reaching age 65.Under the House bill, his widow age 65 orolder would be eligible for monthly benefitsof $150: under the committee bill, she wouldreceive $135, as did her husband. Generally,under the committee bill the Widow wouldreceive either 100% of the benefit her hus-band was actually receiving at the time ofhis death or, if he was not receiving benefits,100% of the benefit he would have been eli-gible for at age 65.About 2.7 million Widows and widowers on the rolls at the end of January 1971 would receive additional benefits, and $649 millioninadditionalbenefit payments would bemde in the first full year.Effective 1. 1971,COSt-of-Living IncreasesThe House-passed bill Would have pro- vided for cost-of-living increases in benefitsand for related increases in the tax base andin the exempt amount under the retirementtest which would have subordinated the roleof Congress in determining benefit levels. Thecommittee has revised these provisions inorder to stress the role of the Congress insetting social security tax and benefit levels.Under the committee bill, socialsecurity benefits would rise automatically in the eventthe cost or living goes up and Congress failedtolegislate on social security benetfis ortaxes. The social security earnings limitationwouldincreaseautomaticallyascovered earnings increase. The full cost of these auto-matic increases would be met equally by in-creases in tax rates and in the tax base, withthe function of determining the base andthe rates performed by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare. The Com-mittee bill would provide that the automaticbenefit increases would not go into effectif In the year befgre the year in which theincrease was to be effective Congress andthe President had agproved a change in socialsecurity benefit levels, or a change in theschedule of social security tax rates, or achange in the social security tax base.Age 132 Computation Point for MenUnder present law, the method of comput-ing benefits for men and women differs inthat years up to age 65 must be taken intoaccount in determining average earnings formen. while for women, only years up to age62 must be taken into account, Also, benefiteligibility is figured up to age 65 for menand up to age 62 for women. These differenceewhich provide special advantages for women S 20328would be eliminated under the committeebill and under the House-passed bill by ap-plying the same rules to men as now applyto women.The House-passed change would apply im-mediately to those already on the rolls aswell as to those coming on In the future.Under the..commlttee's bill, there would bea gradual transition to the new proceduresso that the provision would apply only tothose becoming entitled in benefits i-n thefuture; the number of years used In deter-mining insured status and in computing ben-efits for men would be reduced in 3 stepsso that men reaching age 62 in 1973, andlater, would have only years up to age 62taken Into account in determining Insuredstatus and average earnings.In the first full year, an additional $6 ml!-lion in benefits would be paid out under thisprovision. Under the change in benefit eligi-bility requirements for men, some 2000 peo-ple\u2014workers, their dependents, and survivorsnot eligible under present law\u2014would beadded to the rolls In the first year.Effective date\u2014January 1, 1971.Increase in Maximum Family BenefitsThe committee bill provides that familiescoming on the rolls after a benefit IncreaseIs enacted, as well as families already on therolls at the time the increase is enacted,would be guaranteed the full amount (10percent under the committee bill) of the current and future general benefit increases.Under the committee bill, maximum familybenefits would range from 1.5 to 1.88 timesthe worker'sbenefit amount payableatage 65.Effective date \u2014January 1, 1971.Actuarial Reduction for WomenUnder present law when a woman appliesbefore age 65 for a retirement benefit basedon her own earnings, her benefits are actu-arially reduced to take account of the longerperiod over which benefits will be paid. Ifshe subsequently applies for a wife's benefitafter reaching age 65, her wife's benefit isalso reduced to reflect the fact that shebegan to receive benefits before age 65. TheHouse-passed bill would eliminate actuarialreduction In such cases; the committee billwould retain the provisions of present law.Benefits for Divorced WomenThe committee bill retains the provisionsofpresentlaw which require that in orderto qualify for benefits as a divorced wife,divorced widow orasurviving divorcedmother a woman must show that: (1) shewas receiving at least one-half of her supportfrom her former husband, or (2) she wa.sreceiving substantial contributions from herformer husband, or (3) there was a courtorder in effect providing for substantial con-tributions to her support by her formerhusband.The House-passed bill would delete theserequirements.Waiting Period for Disability BenefitsUnder present law there is a six-monthwaiting period before a disabled person iseligible for social security disability insur-ance benefits. The committee added to theHouse bill a provision to reduce the waitingperiod for disability benefits by two months,80 that benefits would be payable on thebasis of a four-month waiting period, ratherthan a workersand their and disabled widowsand widowers\u2014Would be able to receive abenefit for January 1971 as a result of thisprovision. About $185 million In additionalbenefits would be paid out during the firstfull year.Effective date.\u2014January 1, 1971.Childhood Disability BenefitsThe committee bill, like the House bill,would provide childhood disability benefitsfor the disabled child of an insured retired.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEdeceased, or disabled worker, if his disabilitybegan before age 22, rather than before 18 asunder present law. The committee added anew provision to permit a person who wasentitled to childhood disability benefits tobecome re-entitled if he again becomes dis-abled within 7 years after his prior entitle-ment to such benefits was terminated.About 13,000 people\u2014disabled children andtheir mothers\u2014would immediately becomeeligible for benefits, primarily as a result ofextending the age limit to 22. About $13 mil-lion in additional benefits would be paidout during the first full year.Effective date.\u2014January 1, 1971.Disability Benefits Affected by the Receiptof Workmen's CompensationThe committee deleted the provision in theHouse bill modifying the workmen's com-pensation offset provisions to raise the ceilingon Income from combined workmen's com-pensation and disability Insurance benefitsfrom 80 percent to 100 percent of the dis-abled worker's average current earnings be-fore the onset of his disability.Disability Insurance Benefits for theBlindThe House-passed bill contained a provi-sion which would eliminate the general recency-of-work requirement for people whomeet the definition of blindness in the SocialSecurity Act.

Under thecommittee bill, the child, adopted when adisabled or retired worker is entitled to bene-fits, would be able to get child's benefitsbased on the worker's earnings if: (1) the adoption was decreed by a court of competentjurisdiction within the United States, (2) the child lived with the worker in the UnitedStates for the year before the worker becamedisabled or entitled to an old-age or dis-ability Insurance benefit, (3) the child re-ceived at least one-half of his support fromthe worker for that year, and (4) the childwas under age 18 at the time he began livingwith the- worker.Effective date\u2014January 1, 1971.Refund of Social Security Tax to Membersof Certain Religious Faiths Opposed toInsuranceUnder present law, members of certain re-ligious sects, who have conscientious objec-tions to social security by reason of theiradherence to the established teachings of thesect, may be exempt from the social secuirtyself-employmenttaxprovidedtheyalso waive their eligibility for social security ben-efits. This exemption was written largely torelieve the 010 Order Amish from having topay the social security tax when, because oftheir religious beliefs, they would never drawsocial security benefits.The committee bill would extend the ex-emption (by a refund or credit against in-come taxes at year end) from social securitytaxes to members of the sect who are \"em-ployees\" covered by the Social Security ActDecember 16, 1970as well as the \"self-employed\" members ofthe sect. The employee would have to file anapplication for exemption from the tax andwaive his eligibility for social security andmedicare benefits as the self-employed mem-bers must presently th. The provision spe-cifically provides that there would be noforgiveness of the employer portion of thesocial security tax as the committee believesthis would create an undesirable preferencein the statute.Trust Fund Expenditures for RehabilitationServicesThe committed added to the House bill aprovision to authorize an increase in theamount of social security trust fund moniesthat may be used to pay for the costs of re-habilitating social security disability bene-ficiaries.

The bill would providefor a $1 reduction for each $2 earned withrespect to all earnings above $2,000, not justthose between $2,000 and $3,200. December 16, 1970For 1971 about 650.000 beneficiaries wouldreceive additional benefits, and about 380,000persons who would receive no benefits underpresent law would receive some benefits.Additional benefit payments for the first fullyear would be about $404 million.Effective date.\u2014Taxable years ending after1970.Disability Insurance Benefits ApplicationsFiled Alter committee bill would permit disabilityinsurance benefits (and dependents' benefitsbased on the worker's entitlement to disabil-ity benefits) to be paid to the disabled work-er's survivors if an application for benefitsis filed within 3 months after the disabledworker's death.Effective date\u2014Deaths in and after yearof enactment.Penalty for Furnishing False Information ToObtain a Social Security NumberUnder present law, penalties are not pro-vided for individuals who give false Informa-tion in order to secure multiple social secu-rity numbers with an intent to conceal theirtrue identities. This has led to a number ofproblems in private industry and in the ad-ministrationofGovernmentprograms. Therefore, the committee bill, like the Housebill, would provide criminal penalties if anindividual willfully furnishes false informa-tion with the intent to deceive the Secretaryof Health, Education, and Welfare for thepurpose of obtaining more than one socialsecurity number or of establishing a socialsecurity record under a different name. Uponconviction, an Individual shall be fined notmore than $1,000, or imprisoned for not morethan one year. or both.Other Cash Benefit AmendmentsThe committee also deleted the House-passed amendment providing social securitycoverage for Federal Home Loan Bank em-ployees and adopted amendments relatingto widows who remarry, retroactive paymentsfor certain disabled people, temporary em-ployees of the Government of Guam, po-licemen and firemen In Idaho and police-men in Missouri, certain public hospital em-ployees in New Mexico, registrars of votersin Louisiana, certain U.S. citizens who areself-employed outside the United States andcertain part-time and student employees ofState and local governments in Nebraska.Other amendments included in the commit-tee'sbill relate to the treatment of earn-ings of self-employed people paying taxe8on a fiscal year basis, recomputation of bene-fits based on combined railroad and socialsecurity earnings and payment to a child en-titled on the recordof more than oneworker.B.

Enrollment forsupplementary medical Insurance is also re-quired. Those who enroll would pay the fullcost of the protection\u2014estimated at $27 amonth at the beginning of the program, andrising as hospital costs rise. States and pub-lic organizations, through agreements withthe Secretary, would be permitted to pur-chase such protection on a group basis fortheir retired(or active) employees age 65or over.Limitation on Recognition of Physicians'Fee IncreasesCharges determined to be reasonable un-der the present criteria in the medicare,medicaid, and maternal and child health lawwould be limitd by providing: (a) that afterenactment of the bill medical charge levelsrecognized as prevailing may not be in-creased beyond the 75th percentile of actualcharges in a locality during the previouselapsed calendar year;(b)that for fiscal year 1972 and thereafter the prevailing chargelevels recognized for a locality may be in-creased, in the aggregate, only to the extentjustified by indexes reflecting changes incosts of practice of physicians and In earn-ings levels; and (c) that for medical sup-plies, equipment, and services that, in thejudgment of the Secretary, generally do notvary significantly in quality from one sup-plier to another, charges allowed as rea-sonable may not exceed the lower levels atwhich such supplies, equipment and servicesare widely available in a locality.Termination of Payments to Suppliers ofServices Who Abuse the Medicare ProgramThe Secretary of Health, Education, andWelfare would be given authority to termi-nate payment for services rendered by asupplier of health and medical services foundto be guilty of program abuses.

(Any suchconunittee actually performing such func-tions for medicare purposes would applythese to medicaid cases.)Medicaid Deductibles for the MedicallyIndigentPresent law requires medicaid cost sharingprovisions for the medically-indigent to varydirectly with the amount of the recipient'sincome.This has created an impossible adminis-trative situation for States desiring to applyuniform reasonable copayment requirements(for exampie, 50 cents or $1 per prescription).The amendment would permit States toemploy reasonable Cost sharing provisionswith respect to health services for the medi-cally indigent without requiring variationsbecause of differences in income levels ofdifferent medically indigent recipients.Terminating Payment Where Hospital Ad-mission Not Necessary Under MedicareIf the utilization review committee of ahospital or extended care facility, in its sam-ple review of admissions, finds a case whereinstitutionalization Is no longer necessary,payment would be cut off after 3 days.

The committee substi-tuted for the House section a provision whichwould authorize the Secretary of HEW toreduce the matching selectively In thoseStates where he finds inadequate medicalaudit and utilization review. The cutback Inmatching would be related to the degree ofexcessive costs resulting from Inadequatereview and audit.Payment for Supervisory Physicians InTeaching HospitalsThe committee modified the provision Inthe House bill which would provide for pay-ment for services of certain teaching physi-cians on a cost basis and would make lee-for-servicereimbursement contingent ongeneral billing for such services to all pa-tients and collection from those able to pay.Under the committee modification, reim-bursement of physician time In the teachingserlvce would be determined Ofl a cost orcoat-equivalent basis.

Where certificationsand evidence were provided in a timely basis,any subsequent determination (for purposesof determining medicare payments liability)that the patient no longer required coveredcare would be effective 2 days after notifica-tion to the facility. The committee providesfor a similar approach to the determinationof coverage of home health services.Payments to Health ifaintenaflCeOrganizationsMedicarebeneficiariescould chooseto have their care provided by a health main-tenance organization (a prepaid group healthor other capitation plan). Medicare would contract with such organization, and wouldreimburse them on a capitatlon basis at arate equivalent to 95 percent of the percapita costs of medicare beneficiaries in thearea with actuarial adjustments taking into account variations in patient mix. Profitsaccruing to the organization beyond theirretention rate for non-medicare memberswould be passed to the medicare enrollees inthe form of expanded benefits.

TRADE ACT OF 1970PurposesThecommittee's trade amendment (TitleIII of this bill)is derived, with changes,from HR. 18970 which passed the House ofRepresentatives on November 19, 1970.In brief, the general purposes of the Com-mittee's trade amendment are:(1) To provide to the President limitedtariff-reducing authority for compensatorypurposes until July 1, 1975;(2) To strengthen our unfair trade prac-tice statutes and thus enable industy andworkers who are adversely affected by unfairforeign trade practices to receive a fair op-portunity for relief;(3) To revise the adjustment assistancean tariff adjustment procedures and criteriain the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, and provide a fair opportunity for injured Indus-tries, firms, and workers to receive adequateand prompt relief;(4) To establish import quotas on textilesand footwear, unless: (a) the President findsthem not to be in the national interest or(b) voluntary agreements limiting such im-ports are consummated with foreign govern-ments, or (c) the President finds that Im-ports do not disrupt the U.S. market;(5) To revise the national security pro-visions of the Trade Expansion Act to pre-clude the use of duties or tariffs wheneverthe President has determined that importsofa particular product or material arethreatening to impair the national security;(6) To strengthen the independent statusof the U.S. Tariff Commission; and(7) To make various other changes in ourtariff and trade laws which will streamlinethe procedures dealing with specific importor export problems.Trade Agreement AuthorityThe President's trade agreement authorityunder the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 ter-minated at the close of June 30, 1967. ThePresident has been without such authoritysince that time and in his trade message tothe Congress, of November 18, 1969, he re-quested renewal of the authority, includingnew authority to reduce duties.The committee amendment would extendthe President's authority to enter into newtrade agreements under, the Trade Expan-sion Act of 1962 to July 1, 1975. The Presi-dent is given new authority to reduce dutiesby 20 percent, or 2 percentage points, belowthe rates of duty which will exist when thefinal stage of the Kennedy Round reductionbecomes effective on January 1. 1972, Thecommittee amendment would limit the Presi-dent's authority to enter into and carry outnew trade agreements to those situations inwhich compensatory concessions are neces-sary to offset the effects of an increase inU.S. duties or imposition of other restrictionsby the U.S. Government on the products ofa foreign country which were bound under atrade agreement. Should reductions in dutyunder the new authority be agreed to priorto the final stages of the Kennedy Round,the remaining stages of Kennedy Round re-ductions and the new reductions agreed toare to be aggregated and made effective in atleast two stages.Other Presidential AuthorityConcern has been expressed about the bar-riers to trade which have developed despitethe Kennedy Round of trade negotiation. In1962, the Committee on Finance added sec-tion 252 to the Trade Expansion Act to pro-vide new authority and direction to thePresident to act against import restrictionsor other acts of foreign, countries which un-justifiably or unreasonably burden or dis-criminate against U.S. commerce. The TradeAct of 1970 broadens the President's author-ity to deal with foreign trade barriers andstreamlines the procedures for handling spe-cific complaints.The Trade Act of 1970 also amends thePresident's authority to safeguard the na-tional security by providing that any adjust-ment of imports under the national securityauthority shall not be accomplished by theimposition or increase of any duty or of anyfee or charge having the effect of a duty. Inaddition, time limitations are Imposed onthe Director of the Office of Emergency Pre-paredness in making determinations on ap-plications for action under the national se-curity provision.Tariff Adjustment and AdjustmentAssistanceThe need for making less rigid the criteriafor determining serious injury from increasedimports is met in title III both for tariff ad-justment for industries and adjustment as-sistance in the case of firms or groups ofworkers.Tariff Adjustment\u2014In present law, thecriteria for determining serious injury arethe same for tariff adjustment for industriesand for adjustment assistance for firms andworkers. The committee agrees with theHouse' and the Administration that the pres-ent criteria are too stringent. Under the newprovisions, the Tariff Commission, in the caseof tariff adjustment, or the President, in thecase of adjustment assistance, is to deter-mine whether increased imports \"contributesubstantially\" toward causing or threateningto cause serious injury. In the case of tariffadjustment, the committee provided that in-creased imports must be related in whole orin part to the duty or other customs treat-ment reflecting tariff concessions agreed toby the United States.If serious injury Is found to an industry.those Commissioners finding injure are tomake an additional determination under thenew provision. This additional determinationwill be In the affirmative if the Commissionfinds that imports of the article are: (1) acutely or severely injuring a domestic in-dustryor(2)threateningtoacutely or severely injure a domestic industry.A majority of the Comnissioners presentand voting is to be required for an affirma-tive injury determination and a majority ofthose Commissioners finding injury underthe criteria provided must determine thetype of import restriction required to remedythe injury.When the Commission finds and reportsto the President an affirmative injury deter-mination, the President is required to takesuch action as he deems necessary to preventor remedy the injury so found unless he de-December 16, 1970termines that such action is not in the na-tional interest. In the case of an additionalaffirmative determination by the Commissionon the question of acute or severe injury,the President is required to impose the im-port restrictions found by the Commissionto be necessary to prevent or remedy theacute or severe injury unless he determinesthat such action would not be in the na-tional interest. As is presently provided, ifthe President does not make effective theremedy determined by the Tariff Commis-sion, he must report to the Congress within60 days of the receipt of the Tariff Commis-sion's report and findings. In such case, theexisting provisions of law with respect toCongressional implementation of the TariffCommission finding as to the action neces-sary to prevent or remedy the Injury wouldcontinue to apply.Section 352 of the Trade Expansion Actwith regard to orderly marketing agreementsis amended to provide that the President may,at any time, negotiate such agreements onarticles subject to tariff adjustment or uponwhich he has received an affirmative injurydetermination.New review procedures on pending tariffadjustment action are provided. In any re-port by the Tariff Commission reviewingsuch tariff adjustment actions, it must in-chide information on steps taken by firmsin the industry to compete more effectivelywith imports. In addition, in any review oftariff adjustment actions by the Tariff Com-mission, as a result of which the Presidentmay determine to extend, In whole or inpart, or terminate such action, the Commis-sion will be required to determine whethertheexisting restrictions on imports are suf-ficient to prevent or remedy injury to thedomestic industry.Adjustment Assistance\u2014The Trade Act of1970 alsorevises the procedures for petitionsby firms or groups of workers to provide thatpetitions by firms or groups of workers areto be made to the President rather than theTariff Commission. The Tariff Commissionwill continue to provide the President witha factual report to assist the President inmaking his determination as to eligibilityof firms and groups of workers to apply foradjustment assistance.Theamendment provides increased tradeadjustmentallowances payable to adverselyaffected workers. Under existing law, the al-lowance is 65 percent of the worker's aver-age weekly wage or 65 percent of the averageweekly manufacturing wage, whichever islower.The amendment increases each of these percentages to 75 percent.The amendment provides that if the Pres-ident does not provide tariff adjustment foran industry after an affirmative injury de-termination by the Tariff Commission, he isrequired to provide that the firms and work-ers in that industry may request certifica-tion of eligibility for adjustment assistance.The Committee also provided the TariffCommission with a period of 90 days afterthe date of enactment of this Act to make thenecessary changes in itsrules and regulationsandto so organize itsstaffto expeditiouslyprocessthe tariff adjustment and adjustmentassistancepetitions filed under the provi-sions of this Act. No new petition may befiled under section 301(a) of the Trade Ex-pansion Act until the Tariff Commission is-sues new rules and regulations, which mustbe within 90 days after enactment.Quotas on Certain Textile and FootwearArticlesWe believethat thetariffadjustment amendments described abovewill be suffi- cient to deal with competitive situations fac-ing many domestic producers In the economy.However,theeffectsofrapidly increasingimportson twobasicindustries are suchas to require extraordinarymeasures.Part Bof title IIIofthis bill deals with the cx-CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATE December 16, 1970tremely serious threat to the textile and ap-parel industry and to the nonrubber footwearindustry.Under part B of title III, the total quanti-ties of imports of certain textile and foot-wear articles are to 'be limited by categoryand by country beginning in the year 1971.For that year, imports are to be limited tothe annual average quantities imoorted dur-ing the three calendar years 1967 through1969. For the years after1971, the totalquantity of imports of each category of tex-tilearticlesor footwear articlesisto be limited to the quantity determined for theforeign country for the preceding year plusan increase determined by the President.Any such increase is to be limited to a per-centage not over 5 percent of the total quan-tity permitted to be entered in the Immedi-ately preceding year as the Prcsdnt deter-mines to be consistent with the purposes ofthe quota provisions.The Presidentisauthorizedto exempt from quotas imports of articles: (1) whIch he -determines are not disrupting the U.S.market,(2) when he determines that thenational interest requires such action, or (3)when he finds that the supply of such articlesIn the domestic market is insufficient to meetdemand at reasonable prles.In addition, the President is authorizedto negotiate agreements under which importsof textiles and footwear would be controlledon a voluntary basis. Imports covered bysuch agreements would also be exempt fromquantitative limitations as would imports ofcotton textilearticles as aresult of the existing Long Term Arrangements on CottonTextiles.Determinations with respect to the est.ab-lishment of or change in quantitative limita-tions or exemptions from such limitations.other than determinations made by the Pres-ident for national interest reasons, would besubject to the rulemaking provisions of theAdministrative Procedure Act,The quota limitations provided in the billwould terminate on July 1, 1976, unless thePresident-finds that the extensien of thequantitative limitations for periods not toexceed 5 years would be in the nationalInterest.Other Tariff and Trade ProvisionsThe magnitude and the nature of U.S.foreign trade has changed remarkably overthe past decade. Although both imports andexports separately account for about 4 per-cent of the gross national product, they nowexceed $80 billion. The committee is con-cerned that the rules of competition govern-ing this volume of trade be fair to all con-cerned. Consequently, the committee hastightened the domestic procedures with re-spect to such international trade practicesas dumping and subsidization of exports.Greater recognition as to the role of theTariff Commission as an independnt agencyIs emphasized in amendments mode to theTariff Act of 1930. The committee directs theExecutive and the Tariff Commission to con-duct a series of studies aimed at developingbasic principles of free and fair trade, in-suring reciprocity for U.S. commerce, andfair international labor standards. Provisionis also made for the solution of specific tradeproblems which cannot be remedied underexisting provisions of law.Antidumping Act of 1921The Antidumping Act is amended to prodvide that the Secretary of the Treasury musttake initial action within 4 months afterthe question of dumping has been presentedto him. In exceptional cases the Secretarywould have an additional 90 day period toreach such a finding.if he published inthe Federal Register, within 60 days afterthe complaint is received, the reasons whyadditionaltimeisabsolutelynecessary. Under the committee amendment, this wouldrequire the withholdingof appraisementCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEwithin that period should the Secretary ofthe Treasury have reason to suspect thatsales at less than fair value are. or are likelyto be, taking place. Should the Secretary ofthe Treasury's initial action involve a tenta-tive negative determination, the Secretarywould be authorized to withhold appraise-ment within three months after the noticeof negative determination has been made ifhe should reverse his initial negative deter-mination. In addition, the Antidumping Actis amended to provide criteria for a determi-nation of dumping with regard to importsfromStatecontrolledeconomies.The amendnent reflects existing Customs prac-tices.Countervailing Duty ProvisionThecountervailingdutyprovisionis amended to require the Secretary of theTreasury to make a determination within12 months arter the question is presented tohim as to whether a bounty or grant hasbeen bestowed on imports into the UnitedStates.Under the bill, subsidized duty-free im-ports are also to be subject to the counter-vailing duty provisions but only if the TariffCommission should determine that suchsubsidized imports are injuring a domesticindustry. The countervailing duty provisionis also amended to provide the Secretary ofthe Treasury with discretionary authoritywith respect to the imposition of a counter-vailing duty on an article subject to quan-titative limitation or subject to agreementsunder which the volume of exports to theUnitedStates,islimited.Copntervailing duties would be imposed when the Secretarydetermines that such limitations are not anadequatesubstituteforacountersailingduty with respect to the article in question.Tariff CommissionIn view of the added Investigative and sta-tutory burden on the Tariff Commisionwhich will result from this' legislation and Inview of the concern of the committee to pro-tect the independent nature of the TariffCommission, the committee provided, in ef-fect, that the Tariff Commission's budgetshall be directly appropriated by the Con-gress (as is the budget of other Independentagencies such as the General Account.ng Of-fice), and that the Executive shall not haveauthority to reorganize the Commission. Thecommittee bill also would direct the TariffCommission to do a number of studies whlchcould lay the groundwork for a fresh ap-proach to U.S. trade problems and agree-ments.Comprehensive Studies by the President andTariff CommissionThere are a number of outstanding prob-lems in the field of international trade whichrequire intensive study. One such problemis the apparent lack of balance and recip-rocity in the General Agreement on Tariffsand Trade. The presently constituted GATTagreement contains certain provisions thatwere written in 1947 when the United Stateshad an overwhelmingly dominant position inworld trade. They were designed at that timeto put more dollars into the hands of thethen war-torn European countries. The in-ternational economic positions of Europe,Japan. and the United States have changedso radically since the end 01 World War IIthat a new executive agreement incorporat-ing the provisions of commercial reciprocityin all trade and investment mtters appearsto be desirable, As a first step toward therealization of this goal, the committee's billauthorizes and directs the executive branchand the Tariff Commission to conduct a se-ries of studies dealing with the U.S. positionin world trade and the rules under whichtrading nations can freely and fairly com-pete in world markets. It would be expectedthat this series of studies will lead to con-crete negotiating proposals to the Congressand ultimately to new agreements and ma-S 20333chinery for coping with all trade and in-vestment problems.Foreign Trade StatisticsThe committee trade amendment also pro-vides for the collection and publication ofU.S. import statistics which will show cit.value and thus include the cost of insurance,freight and other charges associated withelf, value. This is the practice recommendedto all countries by the United Nations andtfie International Monetary Fund for com-puting balance of trade statistics. Over 100countries have adopted the so-called ci.!.baste of measuring imports; only the UnitedStates and a few other countries use thefree cm board (fob,) system, under whichimports are tabulated on the basis of theirvalue at the foreign port. The committeefelt that thec.i.f.system willbe more comparable to the method of publishingimport statistics used by most other coun-tries. Moreover, the committee's bill providesthat U.S. exports, which are financed directlyby Government grants and credits, should beshown separately from other exports on allmonthly statistics which are published bythe Department of Commerce.Miscellaneous Trade ProvisionsThe committeetrade amendment alsowould provide certain tariff-rate quota con-trols on imports of glycine and related prod-ucts and on mink furskins.The committee also provided a quarterlyalloca'ion of meat Import quotas and closesaloopholeconcerning\"prepared\"fresh, chilled, and frozen beef and veal. The com-mittee amendment does not extend themoat quota provisions to any other productsnot currently under quota.The committee amendment also providesthat additional invoice information will berequired from foreign shippers for the pur-peas of statistical classification of imports.The committee amendment also would re-duce the rate of duty on parts of ski bind-ings.A new provision of law would authorizethe President to impose a suspension oftrade with a nation which permits the un-controlled or unregulated production of ort.rafficki:g in certain drugs in a manner topermit there drugs to fall into illicit corn\u2014 - rnercefor ultimate disposition and use inthis country.F. AMENDMENTS TO PUBLIC PROGRAMS ANDWORK INCENTIVE PROGRAM1. Aid to the aged, blind, and disabledNation'tl Minimum Income Standards for theNeedy Aged, Blind, and DisabledThe committee bill would establish a na-tional minimum income level for personsWho receive cash assistance under federallymatched Statewelfare programs forthe needy aged, blind, and disabled. States wouldbe required to provide a level of assistancesufficient to assure persons In these catego-ries a total monthly income from all sourcesof at least $130 for a single inividual or $200for a couple. In the aged category this pro-vision would result in increased assistancefor eligible single aged individuals In about31 States and for eligible aged couples inabout 36 States. Concurrently with establish-ing these national minimum standards foras;istance to the aged, blind, and disabled,the committee bill would make persons re-ceiving such assistanceineligibleto par- ticipate in the food stamp program. In ef-fect, the bill would give needy persons morecash in lieu of food stamps.Pass-Along of Social Security Increases toWelfare RecipientsUnder other provisions of the bill, socialsecurity benefits would be increased by 10percent, with the minimum basic social se-curity benefit increased to $100 from its pres-ent $64 level. If no modification were madein present welfare law, however, many needyaged, blind, and disabled persons would get S 20334no benefit from these substantial increasesinsocialsecuritysinceoffsetting reduc-tions would be made In their welfare grants.To assure that such individuals would en-joy at least some benefit from the social se-curity increases, the committee bill requiresStates to raise their standards of need forthose in the aged, blind, and disabled catego-ries by $10 per month for a single individualand $15 per month for a couple. As a resultof this provision, recipients of aid to theaged, blind, or disabled, who are also socialsecurity beneficiaries, would enjoy an in-crease in total monthly income of at least$10 ($15 in the case of a couple).DEFINITIONS OF BLINDNESS AND DISABILITYThe committee bill provides for the es-tablishment of nationally uniform defini-tions of blindness and disability for purposesof the federally matched programs of assist-ance to the blind and disabled. The defini-tions adopted are those already applied inthe disability insurance program establishedunder title II of the Social Security Act.The term 'disability\" would be defined bythe committee bill as \"inability to engage inany substantial gainful activity by reason ofanymedicallydeterminablephysicalor mental impairment which can be expectedto result in death or has lasted or can beexpected to last for a continuous period ofnot less than 12 months,\" with further clari-fication of the meaning of \"substantial gain-ful activity.\"The term \"blindness\" would be defined as\"central visual acuity of 20/200 or less in thebetter eye with the use of correcting lens.\"Also included in this definition would bethe particular sight limitation which is re-ferred to as \"tunnel vision.\"Under present law each State is free toprescribe its own definition of blindness anddisability, and the committee bill would per-mit States to continue assistance to individ-uals who are now on the rolls under theexisting State definition, but who would notbe considered blind or disabled under thenew Federal definitions.Prohibition of Liens in the Program of Aid tothe BlindThe committee bill would prohibit anyState from imposing a lien on a blind in-dividual's property as a condition of his re-ceiving Federally-matched Aid to the Blindwelfare payments. Present law leaves thematter of liens up to the discretion of theStates.Fiscal Relief for the StatesThe committee bill includes a provisionwhich generally would not require States infuture years to spend more for assistance tothe aged, blind, and disabled than 90 per-cent of their expenditures for this purposein calendar year 1970. The 10 percent say-ings would be paid from Federal funds aswould the full amount of any increased ex-penditures resulting from mandatory pro-visions of the bill(such as the $10 pass-along of social security increases and the$130 national minimum standard for as-sistance to the aged, blind, and disabled).Increases In caseloads resulting from normalprogram growth would also be fully paid forwith Federal funds, but increased expendi-tures resulting from liberalizations in Statewelfare programs not required by Federal lawwould not be covered by the 90 percentlimitation. Such optional State liberaliza-tions would be financed in accord with theregular Federal -State matching provisions.2. Child CareAlthough present law includes provisionsdesigned to make child care services avail-able to needy families with children, theseservices are still unavailable to many whoneed them. The lack of child care is particu-larly serious for those Who wish to partici-pate in work or training programs, or whoundertake employment in an effort to becomeeconomically independent. The committeeCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEbill would promote the development of ad-ditional services both by providing for morefavorable matching to the States for childcareservices and by establishing a newmechanism for the delivery of these serv-ices, the Federal Child Care Corporation.Federal Matching ShargThe bill provides for an increase from 75percent to 90 percent in the Federal matchingshare for child care services provided by theStates under title IV part A of the SocialSecurity Act. The Secretary of Health, Educa-tion, and Welfare would be authorized to pay100 percent of the cost of child care for alimited period of time in cases where he de-termined that necessary care would other-wise be unavailable. The 90 percent matchingrate would be available to the States for childcare for families receiving Aid to Familieswith Dependent Children and also for pastand potential recipients,If the State hasadopted theoptional programforthese groups. States would be required to maintaintheir present efforts so that additional Fed-eral funds would result in expanded childcare services.Federal Child Care CorporationAs a mechanism to expand the availabilityof child care services, the bill would establisha Federal Child Care Corporation. The Cor-poration would have as its first priority mak-ing available child care services to childrenof parents eligible for such services under the.AFDC program and who need them in orderto participate in employment or training.However,it would also have the broaderfunction of making child care available forany family which may need it, regardless ofwelfare status.The bill provides for $50 million as initialworking capital for the Corporation. Thisamount would be In the form of a loan bythe Secretary of the Treasury and would beplaced in a revolving fund. The money wouldbe used by the Corporation to begin arrang-ing for child care services. Intially, the Cor-poration would contract with existing public,private nonprofit, and proprietary facilitiesto serve as child care providers. To expandservices, the Corporation would also give technical assistance and advice to organiza-tions Interested in establishing facilities un-der contract with the Corporation. In addi-tion, the Corporation could provide child careservices in its own facilities.Fees would be charged for all services pro-vided or arranged for by the Corporation.The fees would go into the revolving fund toprovide capital for further development ofservices and to repay the initial loan. Theywould be set at a level which would cover thecosts to the Corporation of arranging childcare.The bill also Includes a provision whichauthorizes the Corporation to issue bonds forconstruction if, after the first two years ofoperation, the Corporation feels that addi-tional funds fof capital construction of childcare facilities are needed. Up to $50 millionin bonds could be issued each year, with anoverall limit of $250 million on bonds out-standing. Construction is to be undertakenonly if child care services cannot be providedin existing facilities.Federal child care standards are specifiedin the amendment to assure that adequatespace, staff and health requirements are met.In addition, facilities used by the Corpora-tion would have to meet the Life SafetyCode of the National Fire Protection Asso-ciation. Any facility in which child care isprovided by the Corporation, either directlyor by contract, would have to meet the Fed-eral standards, but would not be subject toany licensing or other requirements Imposedby States or localities.The Corporation, while providing a mecha-nism for expanding the availability of childcare services, would not provide funds tosubsidize child care. Those who are able topay would be charged the full cost of serv-December 16, 1970ices. The cost of clild care needed by fam-ilies on welfare would be paid by State wel-fare agencies.State welfare agencies would be free to usethe services of the Corporation in providingchild care to welfare recipients, but wouldnot be required to do so.The Corporation would also have the au-thority to conduct programs of in-servicetraining, either directly or by contract.The bill requires the Corporation to sub-mit a report to each Congress on the activi-ties of the Corporation, including the dataand information necessary to apprise theCongress of the actions taken to improvethe quality of child care services and plansfor future improvement.The Corporation would be headed by aBoard of Directors consisting of three mem-bers, to be appointed by the President withthe consent of the Senate. The members ofthe Board would hold office for a term ofthree ygars.A National Advisory Council on ChildCare would be established to provide adviceand recommendations to the Board on mat-ters of general policy and with respect toimprovements in the administration of theCorporation. The Council would be com-posed of the Secretary of Health, Education,and Welfare, the Secretary of Labor, theSecretary of Housing and Urban Develop-ment, and 12 indIviduals, appointed by theBoard.3. Improvements in the work incentiveprogramThe Work Incentive Program was createdby the Congress as a part of the Social Se-curity Amendments of 1967. It represents anattempt to cope with the problem of rapidlygrowing dependency on welfare by provid-ing welfare recipients with the training andjob opportunities needed to help them be-come financially independent.Experience under the program has shownthat a number of modifications are desirable.Thecommittee'sbillisdesignedto strengthen and improve the program.On-the-job training and public serviceemploymentA major criticism of the present WorkIncentive Program has been the lack of de-velopment of on-the-job training and publicService employment. On-the-job training andpublic service employment offer the best op-portunity for employment of welfare recipi-ents because they provide training in actualjob situations. Unfortunately, less than twopercent of the welfare recipients enrolledin the Work Incentive Program today areparticipatingin on-the-job training andpublic service employment. The committeeamendment would require that at least 40percent of the funds spent for the WorkIncentive Program be used for on-the-jobtraining and public service employment.The committee bill would also simplifythe financing and increase the Federal shareof the cost of public service employment(formerly called special work projects) byproviding 100 percent Federal funding forthe first year and 90 percent Federal shar-Ing of the costs in subsequent years (if theproject was In effect less than three years.Federal sharing for the flrst year would becut back to 90 percent).Tax Incentive for Hiring WIN ParticipantsAs an incentive for employers in the pri-vate sector to hire individuals placed In em-ployment through the Work Incentive Pro-gram, another feature of the amendmentwould provide a tax credit equar to 20 per-cent of the wages and salaries of these indi-viduals. The credit would only apply towages paid to these employees during theirfirst 12 months of employment, and it wouldbe recaptured if the employer terminatedemployment of an individual during thefirst 12 months of his employment or beforethe end of the following 12 months. This December 16, 1070recapture provision would not apply if theemployee became disabled or left work vol-untarily. (The tax credit is described morefully in Part H of this summary.)Registration of Welfare Recipients and Re-ferral for Work and TrainingUnder present law, all 'appropriate\" wel-fare recipients must be referred by the wel-fare agency to the Labor Department forparticipation In the Work Incentive Pro-gram. Certain categories of persons are stat-utorily consideredinappropriate. Personsmay volunteer to participate in the WorkIncentive Program even if the State welfareagency finds them Inappropriate for manda-tory referral.Another criticism of the program has beenthat the State application of those standardsof \"appropriateness\" for the program haveresulted In widely differing rates of referralsand program participation. The committee'sbill would eliminate this situation with aseries of amendments. First. It would requirewelfare recipients to register with the La-bor Department as a condition of welfareeligibility unless they fit within one of thefollowing categories;1, Children who are under age 16 or at-tending school;2. Persons who are ill, incapacitated or ofadvanced age;3. Persons so remote from a WIN projectthattheireffectiveparticipationispre- cluded;4. Persons whose presence in the home isrequired because of illness or Incapacity ofanother member of the household; and5. Mothers with children of preschool age.At least 15 percent of the regitrants ineach State would be required to be preparedby the welfare agency for traIning and re-ferred to the Work Incentive Program eachyear; States failing to meet this percentagewould be subject to a decrease in Federalmatching funds for aid to famliles with de-pendent children. The committee bill wouldalso establish clear statutory direction indetermining which individuals would re- ceive employment or training by generallyrequiring the Department ofLabor and Health, Education, and Welfare to accordpriority in the following order, taking intoaccount employability potential:1. Unemployed fathers;2. Dependent children and relatives age 16and over who are not in school, working orin training;3. Mothers who volunteer for participation;and4. All other persons.Thus, under the amendment, motherswould not be required to paric1pate untileveryperson who volunteered wasfirst placed,Liberalized Federal Matching for TrainingThe committee bill increases from 80 per-cent to 90 percent the rate of Federal match-ing for WIN training expenditures. Welfareagency expenditures for social. vocational re-habilitation, and medical services which areprovided to directly support an individual'sparticipation in WIN would also be matchedat the 90 percent rate. Under existing law,these services are now generally matched bythe Federal Government at the 75 percentrate.Labor Market Plandlng and ProgramCoordinationThe committee bill would require the Sec-retary of Labor to establish local labor mar-ket advisory councils whose function wouldbe to identify present and future local labormarket needs. The findings of these coun-cils would have to serve as the basis for localtraining plans under the Work Incentive Pro-gram to assure that training was related toactual labor market demands.The committee also mandates coordinationbetween the Departments of Labor andCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEHealth, Education, and Welfare and tl:eircounterparts at the local level. The commit-tee bill would require a separate WIN unitin local welfare agencies and joint partici-pation by welfare and manpower agencIesin preparing employability plans for WINparticipants and in program planning gen-erally.Earned Income DisregardUnder present law States are required, indetermining need for Aid to Families withDependent Childrest, to disregard the first 30monthly earned by an adult plus one-third ofadditional earnings. Costs related to work(such as transportation costs) are also de-ducted from earningsin calculatingthe amount of the welfare benefit.Two problems have been raised concerningthe earned income disregard under presentlaw. First, Federal law neither defines norlimits what may be considered a work-re-lated expense, and this has led to great var!-atlon among States and to some cases ofabuse. Second, some States have complainedthat the lack of an upper limit on the earnedincome disregard has the effect of keeningpeople on welfare even alter they are workingfull-time at wages well above the povertyline.The committee bill would deal with both ofthese problems by modifying the earningsdisregard formula and by allowing only daycare as a separate deductible work expense(with reasonable limitations on the amountallowable for day care expenses). Under thecommittee bill, States would be req ured todisregard the first $60 earned monthly by anindividual working full-time ($30 in the caseof an individual working part time) plus one-third of the next $300 earned plus one-fifthof amounts earned above this.4. Family planning servicesUnder present law, family planning serv-ices must be offered all appropriate welfarerecipients; 75 percent Federal matching isavailable in meeting the cost of family plan-ning services. The committee bill would pro-vide 100 percent Federal funding for familyplanning services offered recipients of Aidto Families with Dependent Children. Inaddition, there would be 100 percent Federalfunding, at the State's option, for those whowere once welfare recipients or who are likelyto become welfare recipients.5. Emergency assistance for migrantfamiliesThe bill would require the States to estab-lish State-wide programs to provide emer-gency assistance to needy migrant familieswith children. The Federal matching ratewould be 75 percent. Under present law theestablishment of programs for migrant I am-iliesis optional with the States, and theFederal share is 50 percept. As under theexisting program, assistance could be in theform cf money payments or payments inkind. Assistance would be lImited to a pe-riod not to exceed 30 days in any 12-monthperiod.6. Obligation of a deserting fathcrPresent law requires that the State welfareagency undertake to establish the paternityof each child receiving welfare who was bornout of wedlock and to secure support for him;if the child has been deserted or abandcnecjby his parent, the welfare agency is requiredto secure support for the child from thedeserting parent, utilizing any reciprocal ar-rangements adopted with other States to ob-tain or enforce court ordels for support. TheState welfare agency is further required toenter into cooperative arrangements with thecourts and with law enforcement officIalsto carry out this program. Access is author-ized to both Social Security and Internal Re-venue Service records in locating desertingparents.The committee added to these provisions anamendment which would make it a FederalS 20335misdemeanor for a father to cross Statelines in order to avoid his family respon-sibilities.In addition, the committee bill also pro-vides that an individual who has deserted orabandoned his spouse, child, orchildren shall owe a monetary obligation to the UnitedStates equal to the Federal share of any wel-fare payments made to the spouse or childduring the period of desertion or abandon-ment. In those cases where a court has is-sued an order for the support and mainte-nance of the deserted spouse or children, theobligations of the deserting parent would belimited to the amount specified by the courtorder. If the State has obtained a court order,the Federal Government would attempt to re-cover both the Federal and non-Federal shareof welfare payments to the deserting fa-t.her's family. If the State has not obtaineda Court erder, the Federal Government wouldonly attempt to recover the Federal shareof the welfare payments. The deserting par-ent's obligation could be collected in thesame manner as any other obligation againstthe United States.The bill also would authorize Federal of-ficials knowing the whereabouts of a desert-in.g parent to furnish this information tosuch parent's spouse (or to the guardian ofhis child) in caset in which a court order forchild support has been issued against him.7. Clarification of congressional Intentregarding welfare statutesDenial of eligibility for aid to families withdependent children where there is a con-tinuing parent-child relationshipUnder present law, aid to families with de-pendent children is available to children whohave beon deprived of parental support byreason of the \"continued absence from thehome\" ofa parent. In a recently decidedopinion, the Supreme Court ruled that aState could not consider a child ineligiblefor weifare when there was a substitute par-ent with no legal obligation to support thechild. The Court stated; \"We believe Con-gre\"s intended the term 'parent' in section406(a)of the act *** toinclude only t\"oe persons with a legal dssty of support.\"The committee bill would clarify Congres-sioai intent by permitting States to takeinto account the presence of a man in thehouse if there exists between the man andthe dependent child a continuing parent-child reiationship. For purposes of determin-ing whether such relationship exists betweena child and an adult individual, only the fol-lowing factors could be taken into account:LI) They are frequently seen together inpublic:(2) The Individual is the parent of a half-brother or half-sister of the child;(3) The individual exercises parental con-trol over the child;(4) The individual makes substantial giftsto the child or to members of his family;(5) The individual claims the child as adependent for Income tax purposes;(6) The individual arranges for the careof the child when his mother is Ill or absentfrona the home;(7) The individual assumes responsibilityfor the child when there occurs in the child'slife a crisis such as Ulness or detention bypublic authorities;(8) The individual is listed as the parentor guardian of the child in school recordswhich are designed to indicate the identityof the parents or guardians of children;(9) The individual makes frequent visitto the place of residence of the child; and(10) The individual gives or uses as hisaddress the address of such place of residencein dealing with his employer, his creditors,postal authorities, other public authorities,or others with whom he may have dealings,relationships, or obligations. S 20336A child-parent relationship could be de-terminated to exist only on the basis of anevaluation of these factors taken togetherwith any evidence which may refute anyInference related to these factors.Duration of Residence RequirementThe committee bill requires States to Im-pose a one-year duration of residence re-quirement in determining eligibility for wel-fare. However, Federal matching would notbe denied solely because a State failed tomeet this requirement. If a welfare recipientmoved to a State with a one-year durationof residence requirement, his State of originwould be required to continue his welfarepayments (as long as he remained eligible)for up to 12 months, by which time theindividual could establish eligibility for wel-fare In his new State of residence.Limitation on Duration of Welfare AppealsProcessRecently the Supreme Court ruled thatassistance payments could not be determinedbefore a recipient is afforded an evidentiaryhearing. The committee bill would requirethat States reach decisions on an individualappeal within 30 days. The committee billalso requires the repayment of amountswhich It Is determined a recipient was notentitled to receive. Any amounts not repaidcould be considered an obligation of therecipient to be withheld from any futureassistance payments to which the individualmay be entitled.States Permitted to Seek to Establish Nameof Putative FatherA recent court decision held that a mother'srefusal to name the father of her illegitimatechild could not result in denial of aid tofamilies with dependent children (AFDC).The applicable State regulation was held tobe inconsistent with the provision in Federallaw that AFDC be \"promptly furnished toall eligible individuals\" on the grounds thatthe State regulation imposed an additionalcondition of eligibility not requred by Fed-eral law. The Court reached this conclusiondespite the explicit requirement in Federallaw that States attempt to establish pater-nity when a child is born out of wedlock.The committee's bill would clarify con-gressional intent by specifying that the re-quirementthatwelfarebefurnishefi \"promptly\" may not preclude a State fromseeking the aid of a mother in Identifyingthe father of a child born out of wedlock.Requiring Welfare Recipient to Permit Case-worker in the HomeThe committee amendment permits States,if they wish, to require as a condition ofwelfare eligibility that recipients allow acaseworker to visit the home. Home visitswould have to be made at a reasonable timeand with reasonable advance notice.8. Regulations of the Department of Health,Education, and WelfareThe committee bill Would curb the regu-latoryauthorityoftheDepartmentof Health, Education, and Welfare in severalparticulars.\"Declaration Method\" of Determining Eligi-bility Permitted But Not RequiredThe Committee bill would preclude theS3cretary of Health, Education, and Welfarefrom requiring by regulation that States usea simplified declaration method in determin-Ing eligibility for welfare. As under presentlaw. States would be free to use this methodif they so wished, but they could not berequired to do so by regulation.Definition of UnemploymentUnder present law, Aid to Families withDependent Children may be paid to a familyheaded by an unemployed father, at theoption of the State (23 States now offer suchassistance). However, there Is no Federal de-finition of \"unemployment\" in the statute.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEThe committee approved an amendment de-fining a father as unemployed for welfarepurposes if he has worked less than 10 hoursin the last week or less than 80 hours in thelast 30 days.9. Use of Federal funds to undermineFederal programsThe committee added a section to the gen-eral provisions of the Soical Security Actspecifying that no Federal funds may be usedto pay, directly or indirectly, the compensa-tion of any individual who in any way par-ticipates in Federally supported legal actiondesigned to nullify congressional statutes orpolicy under the Social Security Act.10. Use of Social Security numbersThe Committee bill requires that on andafter January 1, 1972, State welfare agenciesuse the social security numbers of each wel-fare recipient as an identification numberin the administration of public assistanceprograms.11. Testing 0/welfare reform alternativesThe committee bill provides for a broadprogram of testing of various approachesto reform of the welfare System. The Secre-taryofHealth,Education,and Welfare would be authorized to conduct up to fourtests of possible alternatives to the AFDCprogram. One or two of these tests wouldinvolve \"family assistance\" type programs,and one or two of the tests would involve'workfare\" programs. In addition, the billprovides for a pilot project of a program ofrehabilitationof welfare recipients to beadministered by vocational rehabilitationpersonnel.The \"family assistance\" tests would fol-low the traditional welfare approach of pro-viding money payments to families with in-comes below certain levels, but would ex-tend this assistance to allfamilies with fathers including so-called 'working poor\"\u2014low-income families headed by a fully em-ployed male\u2014who are not eligible for AFDC.As under AFDC, a portion of earnings wouldbe disregarded to provide work incentives,and nondisabled adults (With certain exemp-tions) would h required to accept employ-ment or trainhi:g.The 'won lrre\" tests would make a sharpdistinction between welfare and 'workfare.\"Families with preschool age children wherethe father is dead, absent, or disabled wouldbe presumed unemployable and would beeligible for cash welfare payments. Other lowincome families would not be eligible forsuch payments but would be guaranteedwork opportunity, with training and otherpreparation for employment where necessary.Participants in these \"workfare\" programswould have their wages supplemented Ifthey are below the minimum wage. Allow-ances would also be paid to those in training.Child care and other services would be pro-vided as necessary.The pilot project to test the administra-tion of welfare programs by vocational re-habilitation personnel would involve assist-ance payments according to regular AFDCstandards. These payments would, however.be administered through the facilities andpersonneloftheRehabilitationServices Administration wihch would also apply itsrehabilitation techniques to welfare recip-ients in an attempt to encourage and assistadult individuals with a potential for workto prepare for and obtain employment,The various tests would run for a minimumof two years, Involve State sharing in costs ata level not in excess of State sharing in thecosts of AF'DC, and involve continuing con-sultation among the Department of Health,Education, and Welfare which would con-duct the tests, the General Accounting Of-fice, and the Congress. Each test w\u00e0uid haveto cover all eligible families within a Stateor a part of a State, and for the duration ofthe test no AFDC payments could be madeto familles residing in the test area. EachDecember 16, 1970'family assistance\" test would have to runconcurrently with aworkfare\" test and thetwo test areas would have to be comparablewith respect to various relevant factors in-cluding population, per Capita income, andunemployment rate,G, VETERANS' PENSION INCREASEThe committee bill incorporates the text ofS. 3385, a bill to Increase pension benefits toveterans and widows by up to 9 percent. Thecommittee bill would also increase the In-come limitations, from $2,000 to $2,300 in thecase of a veteran or widow alone, and from$3,200 to $3,600 In the case of a married vet-eran or widow with a child.H. MISCELLANEOUS. AMENDMENTS1. Tax amendmentsDenial of Tax Deduction With Respect toCertain Medical Referral PaymentsPresent law provides that no tax deductionis to be allowed for illegal bribes or kickbackswhere, as a result of the payment, there issuccessful criminal prosecution. If the bribeor kickback does not constitute a criminal act(presumably even if there Is a loss of license),or LI the taxpayer is not successfully prose-cuted, the deduction is allowable.This provision deletes the requirement inpresent law of a criminal conviction in thecase of bribes and kickbacks before a deduc-tion for such a payment is denied. In lieuthereof, the provision provides that no deduc-tion is to be allowed for a bribe or kickbackwhich is illegal under either Federal or Statelaw, If these laws subject the party involvedto liability for criminal or civil penalties tin-cluding the loss of license). In the case of apayment which Isillegal under State law,the deduction will be denied on the basis ofsuch illegality only If the law is generallyenforced. Other sections of this bill providethat medical referral fees under the medicareor medicaid programs are illegal. It is madeclear that referral fees are to be treated asbribes or kickbacks for purposes of this provision.Required Information Relating to Excess Medicare Tax Payments by Railroad Em-ployeesPresent law provides that a railroad em-ployee whose work iscovered by railroadretirement and who isalso employed inother work covered by social security is entitled to receive a credit or refund of theexcess medicare tax he may have paid be-cause of this dual employment status. Toenable a railroad employee to claim his ex-cess medicare tax is a credit on his incometax return, all railroad employees are re-quired to include on the W\u20142 forms given totheir employees the amount of compensa-tion covered by railroad retirement and thehospital tax deducted.Because of the inability of most railroadsto furnish the required information by Jan-uary 31 (primarily because of a broader wageconcept under railroad retirement) and thefact that only a relatively few employees areeligible for this refund, this provision changesthe requirement that railroad employerssupply separate hospital tax information onthe W\u20142 forms for all of their employees.In lieu thereof, the provision reqtlires thatrailroad employers include on, or with, theW\u20142 form furnishedtoits employees, anotice with respect to the allowance of thecredit or refund of the tax on railroad-cov-ered wages in those cases where the em-ployee has also received other wages coveredunder the social security program. Upon therequest of an employee, railroad employersare required to furnish to the employee awritten statement showing the amount ofthe railroad tax coverage, the total amountdeducted as tax, and the portion of thetotal amount which is for the financing ofthe coat of hospitalization insurance underthe medicare program. December 16, 1970 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATE S 20337Reporting of Medical PaymentsPresent law provides that a person whomakes specified kinds of payments in thecourse of a trade or business to another per-son, amounting to $600 or more in a calen-dar year, must file an information returnshowing the amount paid and the name, ad-dress, and identifying number of the recip-ient. Although, under this general require-ment, persons engaged In a trade or businessare required to report direct payments toproviders of health care services (often de-scribed as \"assigned\" payments), there is noauthority under present law to require thereportingof payments made topatients themselves ('unassigned\" payments), eventhough In the normal circumstances, theyare paid overto providers of health careservices, or represent reimbursement of ear-lier payments.The bill provides specifically, in additionto the general requirement of present law,that all payments in the course of a trade orbusIness made to providers of health careservices in the case of direct or 'assigned\"payments must be reported., Further. In thecase of \"unassigned\" or indirect payments,reporting will be required in those caseswhere the Federal Government administersthe health program or funds the program toa substantial extent. The reporting require-ment specifically includes professional serv-ice corporations. proprietary hospitals, andother payees who may act as conduits forproviders of health care services.The provision also requires the Secretaryof the Treasury and the Secretary of Health.Education, and Welfare to study the extentto which \"unassigned\" and \"assigned\" claimsare used to obtain payments.from insuranceorganizations and to report each year to theSenate Committee on Finance and the HouseCommittee on Ways and Means any signifi-cant shift from the use of \"assigned\" claimsto \"unassigned\" claims. In addition, the pro-vision requires that the Secretary of Health,Education, and Welfare keep records show-ing the identity of each provider of medicalor health care items or services under themedicare or medicaid programs, the types ofitems or services provided and the aggregateamounts paid to the providers under eachprogram. Health care providers are requiredto he identified by their taxpayer identifyingnumbers, The Secretary of Health. Educa-tion, and Welfare must submit to the SenateCommittee on Finance and the House Com-mittee on Ways and Means annually a reportIdentifying each person who is paid a totalof $25,000 or more during the preceding yearunder the medicare and medicaid programs.These reports are due to he submitted forthe calendar year, beginning With 1970. notlater than June 30 of the following calendj.ryear.Tax Credit for Portion of Salary Paid Partici-pants In Work Incentive ProgramsUnder present law there are no special taxprovisions relating to the costs of employeetraining programs, These costs are treated asany other business expense and may be de-ducted if they are ordinary nd necessary Incarrying on the taxpayer's trade or business,This provision provides a special tax incen-tive for employers who hire individuals undera work incentive program (WIN) establishedunder section 432(b) (1) of the Social Secur-ity Act. The taxpayer Would be allowed, asa credit against his income tax liability, andin addition to his regular business deduction,an amount equal to 20% of the wages andsalaries paid to the employee during the first12 months of his employment. Any unusedtax credits could be carried back to the threepreceding taxable years (but only to a tax-able year beginning after December 31, 1988)and then could be carried forward to thenext seven succeeding taxable years,However, If the taxpayer terminated theemployment of the individual at any timeduring the first 12 months of employment,or at any time during the next 12 months,any tax credit allowed under this provisionwould be recaptured. The credit would berecaptured by Increasing the taxpayer's taxliability, in the year of termination, by anamount equal to previous tax credits allowedwith respect to the employee. The recaptureprovision would not apply if the employeevoluntarily left the employment of the tax-payer, or If the employee became disabled.Further, a credit would not be allowed forany expenses of training outside the UnitedStates or If the employee is closely related tothe taxpayer.RETIREMENT INCOME CREDITPresent law provides a retirement incomecredit of 15 percent of eligible retirement in-come up to a maximum of $1,524 for a singleperson and $2,286 for married couples whereeach is fully eligible In his or her own right,The credit Is designed to provide comparabletax treatment to those who receive tax-exempt social security benefits and thosewho receive taxable pensions, Consequently.the maximum base for the credit is reducedby social security benefits received and byearnings in excess of $1,200\u2014a reduction of50 cents for each dollar of earnings between$1,200 and $1,700 and dollar for dollar forearnings in excess of $1,700.Because of Increasesinsocialsecurity benefits since the present maximum base forthe credit was established, this provision in-creases the base for the credit to more closelyapproximate the current levels of social se-curity benefits.It increases the $1,524 to$1,872 and the $2,286 to $2,808. In addition,the amount that can be earned without re-ducing the base for the credit is raised from$1,200 t $1,680 and the rgnge within whichthe Base is reduced 50 cents for each dollaro1 earnings is raised to $1,680 to $2,880.2. Other AmendmentsThe commitee also added provisions relat-ing to the authorization of the managingtrustee of the social security trust funds toaccept gifts made unconditionally to the So-cialSecurityAdministration,authorizing loans for the installation of sprinkler systemsnecessary forfacilities to meet medicarestandards, increasing the grade level of theCommissioner of Social Security, requiringthe consent of the Senate to future appoint-ments to the position of Administrator ofSocial and Rehabilitation Services, and ex-tension of the provision for disregarding cer-tain social security benefit increases underwelfare programs.Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, will theSenator yield?Mr. LONG. Mr. President, I will yieldfor a question.Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, will theSenator from Louisiana state what heunderstands the procedure to be on theconsideration of the bill? Will it comeup in the period from 9 to 3 or In theperiod from 3 to 9, or does the Senatorknow? Perhaps we could ask for theattention of the majority leader.Mr. MANSFIELD. Yes.Mr. HARRIS. I have asked the man-ager of the bill whether the considera-tion of this bill would come from 9 to3 each day or from 3 to 9, or do we know?Mr. MANSFIELD. It will be in the sec-ond shift each day. The pending bus!-ness from 9 to approximately 3 will bethe conference report on the Departmentof Transportation appropriations bill.Mr. HARRIS. Will the Senator yieldfurther?Mr. LONG. I yield for a question.Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, does theSenator intend to ask unanimous consentthat the committee bill as reported beconsidered as original text for the pur-pose of amendment to the second degreethereafter?Mr. LONG. I would like to do so, be-cause I know that it would expedite theconsideration of the bill. I am led to be-lieve, however, that such a request willbe objected to. However, I intend to doit, and just for the purpose of discussion,Mr. President, I ask unanimous consentthat the committee amendment.s be re-garded as original text for the purpose ofconsidering further amendments.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is thereobjection?Mr. WILLIAMS ofDelaware. Mr.President, reserving the right to object,I have told the Senator from Louisianathat I thought we could get such a re-quest with the exception of three or fourmajor items of the bill which I thinkdeserve a rollcall vote or special atten-tion. As soon as we can get those markedin the bill, we will be able to reach them.For example, there is a committeeamendment that deals with changingthe social security benefits from the 5percent provided in the House bill to the10 percent which was approved by theSenate Committee.Anothercommitteeamendmentchanges the minimum of $100 a monthlimitation.Then there is the question of whetherwe do or do not approve an escalatingcost-of-living provisions.Then there is the question of cat,as-trophic health insurance amendment.I cite those four examples. I am surethat some Senator will want to vote onthe Trade Act as well.I am saying there are four or five ofthose items, and with the exception ofthose items which will require roilcallvotes we will be able to reach a unazl-mous-consent agreement.I have asked the staff to mark up abill for me with respect to those partic-ular amendments and how much wouldbe included in them so that at the ap-propriate time we can agree to the con-sideration of all committee amendmentsexcept those. If the Senator wishes tomake that request I think I could havethat information tomorrow so we couldagree. I believe there are about 100 items.and many of them do not amount tomuch; they are technical amendments.I would say that except for the four orfive votes we could get down to business.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, I am gladthe Senator has raised the question. Iwould be inclined to agree to that typeprocedure if it could be agreed upon. Iam sure everyone realizes if we can agreeto accept the commitee amendments enblock, reserving the right of any Senatorto amend in both the first degree andsecond degree, which isthe same asagreeing that the bill simply be re-garded\u2014all of it\u2014as being original text,it really preserves to every Senator theright to offer as many amendments ashe wants to offer and that is the proce-dure that is usually adopted. It will helpto exped.ite consideration of the bill.No one forfeits any right under thatarrangement and when that agreementis made it offers to the sponsors of the billthe availability of a motion to table inorder to get on with the business, so it S 20338confers an advantage on Senators, whicheveryone should recognize, when thatarrangement isagreed to, because ifsomeone is against the bill or if someoneis adamantly opposed to its passage, if aparticular part of the bill is agreed tothen, of course, he would have the rightto insist that every amendment be thesubject of debate, explanation, and a roll-call vote and insist on the presence of aquorum duringallthe consideration.While it is not unusual, I believe it wouldvery much expedite procedure on the bill.Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, will theSenator yield?Mr. WILLIAMS ofDelaware.Mr. President, before the Senator yields, willhe yield to me for just a moment?Mr. LONG. I yield to the Senator fromDelaware.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. Pres-ident, I agree fully with the chairman. Ihave discussed the matter with him ear-lier and said '1 thought we could get thisconsent agreement. For example, thefirstcommitteeamendmentmerely changes the title and renumbers. Thatamendment Is just a routine amendment.The next amendment Is a question ofwhether we raise social security benefitsby 5 percent, or to $100. I would sug-gent we could agree on the first commit-tee amendment, and the next committeeamendment could go over until tomor-row. We would know what the nextamendment would be and we could havea vote tomorrow.Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-sent that the first committee amendmentbe agreed to.The PRESIDING OFFICER. There isa unanimous-consent request pending.Mr. HARRIS. That was withdrawn.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. That hasbeen withdrawn.Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-sent that the first committee amend-ment be agreed to. It amends the titles.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is thereobjection?

Mr.President, the next committee amend-ment deals with social security increases.There will be no vote on that tonight.Tomorrow there will be a vote on socialsecurity.Mr. hARRIS. Mr. President, will theSenator yield?Mr. LONG. I yield for a question.Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, I thankthe Senator for yielding. I would like tohave the attention of the Senator fromDelaware, as well. I understand the posi-tion of the Senator from Delaware. Icommend him for his willingness to agreeSec. 223.Sec. 224.Sec. 225. December 16, 1970 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATE S 20339later on to portions of the committee billbeing amendable in the second degree.There will be objection to title III, thetrade portion of the bill.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. That iscorrect.Mr. HARRIS. My intention is that weshould try to get a vote this week on thewelfare reform bill, the amendment to beoffered by the Senator from Connecticut(Mr. RIBICOFF) and the Senator fromUtah (Mr. BENNETT), in amendable form,so that I can before its final considera-tion offer amendments to it, and that wealso get down to the social security billthis week.Would the Senator have any objectionat the appropriate time to the welfaresection of the committee bill being con-sidered as original text? I understand hewould not object to that.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. When weget to the welfare section?Mr. HARRIS. Yes.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. As far asI am concerned I do not think therewould be objection. I know what the Sen-ator from Oklahoma has in mind, sowhen it is offered it would be subject toan amendment, and I think it should be.Mr. HARRIS. The Senator is correct,thatis,so that the Ribicoff -Bennettamendment will be subject to amend-ment.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I am inagreement with what the Senator seeksto achieve. I do not think there would beobjection. I think that is the appropriateway to proceed.The only exception I was making Isthat,for example, the trade sectionwould have to be voted on, catastrophicinsurance is a section unto itself, andsocial security insurance would have avote. I would say there would be a halfdozen votes and we would be pretty muchdown to the serious arguments.Mr. LONG. If there Is no objection tothat part of it, I believe in moving aheadany way we can, provided it does notprejudice the rights of anyone. I wouldnot want to prejudice anyone's rights. Ido not see how It would prejudice any-one's right if we agreed now on the wel-fare portion being original text.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. If theSenator will withhold that until tomor-row I think we could work out somethingthat Is agreeable, something that wouldbe acceptable. As the Senator knows,they want a vote on the trade section.I can understand their position on that.I have mentioned catastrophic insur-ance. In a couple of hours we could callthe roll on that and perhaps vote tomor-row on that particular point.I would like to see us proceed and getthis out in a proper manner. I would liketo complete this matter up or down, oneway or another, between now and the endof the year.Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, will theSenator yield so that I may place a state-ment in the RECORD.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, I ask unan-imous consent that I may yield to theSenator from Oklahoma for the purposeof placing a statement In the RECORD.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Withoutobjection, It Is so ordered.Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, I appre-ciate the answers of the Senator fromLouisiana and the Senator from Dela-ware. I hope that we will be able to acton this bill, with the exception of titleIII, dealing with trade, so that we canget a vote on social security and welfarereform, this week.I am very hopeful the Senate will actpromptly to enact much needed in-creases and improvements in the socialsecurity, medicare, and medicaid pro-grams, and real welfare reform. I haveworked toward that end in the Com-mittee on Finance.Mr. President, I have set forth myposition concerning HR. 17550 in sep-arate views printed in the committee re-port, and I ask unanimous consent tohave my views printed at this point inthe RECORD.There being no objection, the separateviews of Mr. HARRIS were ordered to beprinted in the RECORD, as follows:SEPARATE VIEWS OF MR. HARRISINTRODUCTIONThe initial objectives of HR. 17550 were toprovide more adequate social security bene-fits and to make needed improvements Inmedicare, medicaid and maternal and childhealth programs.The objective of HR. 16311 was to effecturgently needed reform of a falling welfaresystem.These objectives are highly laudable. How-ever, by the addition of unrelated matters,unwise amendments and weak substitutionsfor some provisions, these criginal objectiveshave been made hostage to other, less noble,alms.The Trade Act of 1970 was added as anamendment to HR. 17550.Various amendments to the present wel-fare laws were agreed to which can only becharacterized as regressive and punitive.An amendment to establish a Federal ChildCare Corporation, which would represent asubstantial and objectionable change in childcare programs, was adopted.I, therefore, voted against reporting thebill. My reasons for doing so are here setforth in detail.SOCIAL SECURITYA. Increase in benefits and minimumsThe committee made several greatly neededimprovements in the social security provi-sions of HR. 17550.The 5 percent Increase in benefits, adoptedby the House, was stepped up to a 10 per-cent increase. The committee also rightlyvoted to provide a $100 minimum social secu-rity benefit level.With these increases, HR. 17550 became anacceptable advance this year toward Tairnessin our social security program.B. Workmen's compensation offsetThe committee made certain other changesin the House bill provisions regarding socialsecurity which were undesirable.The provision in the House bill, amend-ing present law which requires social secu-rity disability benefits to be reduced whenworkmens compensation is also payable andwhen the combined payments exceed 80 per-cent of average current earnings before dis-ablement, was stricken.The House bill called for a reduction inbenefits by the amount by which the com-bined payments under both programs exceed100 percent of average current earnings be-foredisability.This provision should berestored.C. FinancingWhen the committee finished its work, ithad voted approximately $10 billion in addi-tional benefits. It then turned to financing.I believe the committee was mistaken innot properly taking into account the pres-ently regressive nature of the social securitytax system and in not fully considering theeconomic Impact of the financing arrange-ments which it approved.The social security tax system is not asnearly based upon ability to pay as is theFederal Income tax. There Is an upwardlimit\u2014presently$7,800. and $9,000 underthe committee bill\u2014on the amount of salarywhich is taxed. The tax is in a fiat rate basis;it is not graduated.I believe that the payroll tax under socialsecurity has reached the saturation point. I,therefore, supported an effort to finance aportion of benefits from general revenue.This effort failed.Alternatively, I offered a financing planwhich would make the social security taxsystem more progressive by raising the wagebase to $12,000 in 1971. This allows actuarialsoundness with less of an Increase in thetax rate over a period of years. The followingtable shows the financing plan which I of-fered and which was rejected by the com-mittee. As indicated, in addition to providingactuarial soundness over the long term ineach of the funds involved\u2014OASDI, healthinsurance and the new catastrophic healthinsurance\u2014the plan which I offered wouldavoid a cash deficit in any year in any of thefunds.tinpercenti OASDIHiCiTotal 19711972\u2014744.10.74.81975-794.1.80.35.21980-84 .9. 356.251985 plus5.85\u2014.151.01.0\u2014.06'.35.4+.026.857.25 millions I offered wouldalso provide an additional and very impor-tant economic impact. It would postpone anincrease in the tax rate from 4.8 to 5.2, whichis otherwise scheduled to go Into effect inJanuary 1971 under present law. Unless thierate increaseis postponed, it will have ftseriously dampening effect on consumer de-mand at a time when the economy is muchtoo sluggish and unemployment intolerablyhigh.Stimulationofconsumer demandthrough postponementofthepresently scheduled tax rate increase and through in-creased benefits would not be inflationaryby serving to cause expanded productionvolume, allowing some reduction in unitcosts.The revised manner In which Federalbudgets are now made up and presented, tak-ing into account income and expendituresfrom social security and other trust funds,more clearly points up the fiscal impact ofdecisions concerning social security benefitsand rates.In addition to the right of social securitybeneficiaries to more adequate benefits, thepayment of increased benefits will provide amuch-needed increase in consumer demand.aiding economic recovery. This fiscal impactshould not be offset by immediate rate in-creases, primarily the way in which the au-tomatic adjustment of the benefits vent anannual deficit in the various funds or toprovide general actuarial soundness.D. Cost-of-living increaseThe committee worked long and hard onthe problem of how to Insure that the pur- S 20340 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEDecember 16, 1970chasing power of social security benefits ismaintained. On the whole the committeeacted wisely in this regard; however, I dis-agree with some aspects of the automatic ad-justment provisions\u2014primarily the way inwhich the automatic adjustments of thebenefits is financed.The committee made some major changesin the automatic adjustment provisions thatwere proposed by the administration andpassed by the House ofRepresentatives.Many of the changes are reasonable, butsome aspects of the provisions agreed to bythe committee should be changed if theyare to be fully acceptable and are to op-erate smoothly.There are two major difficulties with thecommittee provisions concerning automaticadjustment of social security benefits andautomatic financing.First, the committee bill would require theSecretary of Health, Education, and Welfareto promulgate increases in both social secli-rity tax rates and the earnings base in orderto finance the automatic increases in bene-fits, even though such increases in socialsecurity taxes would be unnecessary andwouldgreatlyover-financethe program. Under the committee bill, whenever an auto-matic cost-of-living increase in benefit oc-curs, the Secretary would be required to in-crease social security taxes. Such increasesin taxes would not be necessary because alarge part of the cost of the automatic bene-fit increase would be met from rising earn-ings levels without increasing either the taxrate or the earnings base.Second, the provision for automatic in-creases In the earnings base as wages rise,proposed by the administration and passedby the House, does not constitute a discre-tionary delegation to the executive branch,The increases would be automatic and thedetermination of the amount, would be rou-tine on the basis of social security wagerecord statistics.Under the committee revision, on the otherhand, It would be necessary for the Secretaryof Health, Education, and Welfare, as a partof the automatic provisions, to determineboth the short-range and long-range \"cost\"of each automatic benefit increase, and wewould in effect be turning over to the Secre-tary of Health. Education, and Welfare thetax-setting function of the Congress.The provision approved by the Housewould merely carry out automatically thepolicy which the Congress has been follow-ing on an ad hoc basis since 1950\u2014that is,periodically increasing the social security earnings base so as to cover the same propor-tion of payroll as had been covered earlier,when wage levels were lower. As wages haverisen, the $3,600 base that became effectivein 1951 has been, changed by the Congress,'In steps, to $7,800\u2014as it would have beenunder the automatic provisions. It is impor-tant to increase the base to keep up to datewith rising wages, not only from the stand-point of the Income of the program but toprevent a deterioration in the coverage ofthe program. For example, a job which paid$3,600 in 1950 pays around $9,000 today. Ifthe base had not been increased over theyears the benefits payable to a man in sucha job would provide a much smaller propor-tion of wage replacement than they wereoriginally Intended to. and there would havebeen a major deterioration in the protectionafforded by the program. If the base is keptup to date with rising wage levels, there willbe little if any need for an Increase in thetax rate to cover the cost of the automaticcost-of-living Increase.The House provisions in this regard are,therefore, preferable to the provisions adopt-ed by the Senate, and they should be restored.The House bill requires the Secretary ofHealth, Education, and Welfare to Increasesocial security benefits any January, com-mencing January 1973, 11 he finds that thecost of living has increased by 3 percent ormore between the last July-to-Septembercalendar quarter preceding a secretarially de-termined benefit increase and the most re-cent July-to-September quarter. The auto-matic increases would be in addition to anyincreases which might be passed by Congress.The taxable wage base would increase auto-matically every 2 years based on increases inthe average taxable wages after 1971.MEDICARE AND MEDICAIDA. Health maintenance organizationsMedical costs have risen enornously. Thereare many causes for this. One cause is thegreatly increased demand for medical serviceswithout a concurrently increased supply inpersonnel and facilities.It is imperative that there be a massiveincrease in medical and paramedical person-nel and in medical facilities. The shortagesarealready acute, and they are growingalarmingly.It is also vital that there be much betteruse of existing personnel and facilities. To-ward that end, the committee approved thehealth maintenanceorganizationconcept contained In HR. 17550. Under this provision,medical payments can be made to physicianson a per capita basis, rather than on a fee-for-service basis only.This provision is an important step forwardtoward encouraging prepayment for groupmedical practice and toward greater em-phasis on preventative medicine.B. Professional standards revieworganisationThe committee adopted a proposal to es-tablish professional standards review organi-zations at local and State levels throughoutthe country to review such functions as ex-amination of patient and practitioner pro-files;independent medical audits; on-site audits; and the development and applicationof norms of care and treatment.The Secretary of Health, Education, andWelfare would be required to enter intoagreements with qualified professional stand-ards review organizations, principally localmedical societies, to review the totality ofcare rendered or ordered by physicians formedicare and medicaid patients. Where med-ical societies are unable or unwilling to un-de taketheresponsibility,theSecretary could contract with States or local healthdepartments or other suitable organizations.This provision has a laudable purpose: toInsure quality care and to hold down un-necessary costs.However, the proposal contains many un-known and unpredictable factors. Further,there are serIous objections that it grantsorganized medicine too much control overutilization of facilities.The proposal should be tested before Con-gress puts It into effect on a total basis asthe committee bill would do. I am not satis-fied that this proposal will result In thesavings whIch have been claimed by its pro-ponents, nor am I satisfied that the reviewprocedure is the best and most workablewhich can be devised.The House provisions on peer review shouldbe strengthened, and the Senate committeeprovisIons should be stricken.C. Stale maintenance of effortUnder present law States are required tomaintain their present financial efforts Insupport of medicaid and are required to buildtoward comprehensive medicaid programs by1077.The State of Missouri asked the commit-tee to pass legislation giving it a special one-time exemption from the maintenance of ef-fort requirement. The committee could havegranted this special request, based upon uni-que circumstances, without upsetting thepresent law.But the committee went far beyond theMissouri request and repealed the entiresection 1902(d)of the present law. underwhich States are required to maintain theirfinancial efforts under medicaid. The Houseof Representatives had previously strickensection 1903(e) whIch requires States to en-act comprehensive medicaid programs by1977.The repeal of both these sections is mostunfortunate. The poor people covered bymedicaid are entitled to better medical at-tention and care-\u2014not less.Theirneeds should not be ignored in order to slow therising Costs of this program and medical caregenerally. Section 1902(d) and section 1903(e) should be restored in the bill.D. Physical therapyThe House bill provides for reimbursementof up to $100 of the Cost of physical therapyon an outpatient basis in the office of an in-dependent piactitloner under part B of med-icare. This provision was rejected by theSenate committee.A great many beneficiaries need the serv-ices of a physical therapist, and these serv-ices can often best be performed in the officeof the therapist. The limited reimbursementthat the House approved, which Ia effect putsit on a trial basis, should be reinstated inthe bill.E. Blood replacementThe committee rejected aproposalto eliminate the requirement In the presentlaw for a medicare patient to pay for orreplace the first three pints of blood usedby such patient. This requirement seems un-reasonable. It places an undue burden onmedicare patients, and it should be elim-inated.F. Medicare premium increa.cesThe premium for part B, supplementarymedical Insurance, under medicare has in-creased by more than 80 percent in the last4 years. Originally the premium was $3 amonth per person. It was increased from$4 to $5.30 on July 1, 1970. For those liv-ing on social security, this increase Is al- most prohibitive and it should be eliminatedif the aim of the medicare is to be real-ized.WELFARE REFORMA. Need for reformDuring the past few years, the need forreform of our welfare system has assumedcrisis proportions. Three parallel develop-ments ave dramatized the urgency; sharplyincreasing welfare rolls, growing recognitionof the inefficiency and failures of the systemitself, and ever more crippling fiscal burdenson States and localities.Neither the poor\u2014a group that is wideningevery day In the current economic climate\u2014the Nation's Stability, nor any pretense tosound social policy can wait longer for arational income maintenance system.This case has been made so often and soconvincingly by mayors. Governors, welfareadministrators, recipients, social scientists,and political figures of every persuasion thatthere is no need for it being made again.Toward this end, I Introduced with sevenother Senators the National Basic Incomeand Incentive Act, S. 3433. ThIs bill calls forthe federalization of the presently outdated,unworking, and Inhumane welfare system,replacing it with a Federal income mainte-nance system. It represents a significant de-parture from our present thinking aboutwelfare and represents true reform.I had hoped that improvements in H.R.16311 could be made that would move thefamily assistance plan closer to the conceptsof the National Basic Income and IncentiveAct and real reform. Unfortunately, the com-mittee moved in the opposite direction andwas willing to approve only a test of variouspilot reform programs.Passage of a test proposal alone will surelydelay congressional consideration of real re- December 16, 1970form for at least 3 years. I do not believethat the Nation can wait.There is good reason to predict that thenumber of families and individuals requir-ing financial aid will continue to increase,that State and local funds crucially neede1for programs to reduce dependency will bedrained by the demands of public assistance,that the inequities of the present sl'stem willcontinue to demean recipients so as to de-stroy their incenive, and that the entire Na-tion will suffer from a welfare system thatmust be revised.B. Requirements for real reformPerhaps if the administration had beenwilling to make progressive changes in theHouse-passed version of the family assistanceplan, rather than regressive changes duringthe consideration of the bill by the commit-tee, something more substantial than a testwould have been reported by the committee.Elimination of mandatory coverage of fami-lies headed by an unemployed father (AFDC\u2014UP) and elimination of the requirement thatStates maintain current benefit levels forfamilies with income, provisions that werein the President's original welfare reformproposal, weakened support for the bill inthe committee by those of us who were ad-vocating more meaningful reform of our wel-fare system.A failure to recognize the importance ofrequiring the minimum or prevailing wage,whichever is higher, also weakened supportfor the bill.While I do not believe that the adminis-tration has gone as far as it should, I ampleased that it has now agreed to some ofthe changes in the family assistance planwhich Senator Mccarthy, Senator Ribicoffand I and others advocated. The changesthe administration has now approved areembodied in the amendments offered by Sen-ator Ribicoff and Senator Bennett.Ibelieve that additional improvementscan and should be made.Recognizing that congress Is not willingto completely federalize the welfare systemat this time, a goal should nevertheless beestablished for moving Within a time certaintoward a welfare system that is federally fi-nanced and administered. Included withinthe goal should be a commitment to movethe level of payment to an adequate income.Our goal Is to assist people in getting outof poverty, but a floor at a low level, insteadof raising families out of poverty, means onlycontinued poverty with little prospects forbreaking out.Any system of reform should also requirethattheprevailingor minimum wage,whichever is higher, should be paid for thosewho are forced to take a job. Otherwise, acaptive work force with insufficient stand-ard of wage to be paid will he available toemployers, and the effect will be to keepwages so low that millions will remain inpoverty though working full time.Any version of the family assistance planthat is adopted by the Senate should notrequire mothers with school-age childrento work. Mothers should have some controlover whether day care centers are goodenough for their children.Furthermore, a provision to provide forcost-of-living increases in payments to re-cipients should be adopted. We have recog-nized this principle with regard to those whOare recsiving social security payments, andthe same arguments can be made in supportofprovidingcost-of-livingincreasesfor those on public assistance.Any system of welfare reform should alsofully protect the rights of present recipientsand of applicants to insure that the new law doss not createdifferentclassesof citizens.A national system of income maintenance,recognizing the needs of the working poor, setting uniform national minimums of as-sistance and removing present barriers toincentiveandinitiativeisdesperately needed.These principles can and must be embod-ied in real welfare reform, together withprograms which assure that, through ex-panded public service jobs and otherwise,people have a real chance to get a job.C. Regressive amendmentsUnfortunately, the committee adopted anumber of amendments to our present sys-tem that are regressive.The most disappointing action of the com-mittee was the barring of legal service law-yers from representing welfare recipients.Much of the work of these lawyers in thepast few years has been to secure benefitsguaranteed by law, but not received by poorpeople due to illegal regulations and adntin-istrative practice.During the past 3 years welfare recipientsand lawyers associated with federally fundedlegal service programs have compiled a re-markable record of service to poor people.Significant court decisions have begun tonudge the welfare system toward a moreequitable and enlightened program. Crueland demeaning regulations, Irrelevant to thepurposes of the Social Security Act, havebeen overturned in the courts.The Finance Committee has proposed thatthis record of progress be nullified. Thisrestrictive amendment, adopted by the com-mittee, should be defeated.Otherundesirableamendmentswere adopted by the committee.The committee would make the leaving ofa family and moving across State lines aFederal misdemeanor. This Is an unwar-ranted extension of Federal police power intointimate aspects of family life and, in viewof the State laws now regulating this sub-ject, would prove to be unworkable.The action taken by the committee ininstituting a 1-year residency requirementfor people In need of assistance was likewiseregrettable. The committee provision is inconflict with the Supreme Court's opinionin Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.S. 618, Inwhich it was held that citizens hiave aconstitutional right to travel throughoutthe States and that welfare eligibility regu-lations should not Impede that right. Thecommittee position would restrict the rightto travel precisely in the manner prohibitedby the Court.The committee was also mistaken, in myopinion, in resurrecting the onerous man-in-the-house rule. This rule, knocked downby court decision, would base eligibility noton actual resources but on imagined incomefrom people not legally obligated to supportthe children involved.Provisions were also adopted that requirethe return of amounts paid to welfare re- cipients who do not prevail at hearings; that eliminate progress made In the declara-tion system; that cut back on the Federalassistance now available to families with a father in the home; and that provide eligi- bility requirements wholly unrelated to the need of poor children.Adoption of these provisions represents a step backward in our efforts to devise a more workable and humane system of welfare\u2014 an entreflchmemt of old myths about welfare and welfare recipients that should have been cast aside years ago.D. Aid to aged blindS anddisabledThe committee made substantial changes In the House bill with regard to benefits for the aged, blind and disabled. The House billprovided for a minimum of $110 a month for single individuals and $220 for couples. The committee approved $130 for single in- dividuals and $200 for couples, cashing out food stamps.Taking Into consideration the fact that an Increase in social security benel'its reducesS 20341Federal, and State expenditures for the aged,blind and disabled\u2014and considering theirgreat and growing needs\u2014the Senate shouldprovide for a minimum of at least $130 forsingle individuals and $230 for couples, notcashing out food stamps for these individ-uals.E. Catastrophic health insurance planA critical problem has arisen because ofthe rapidly increasing costs of medical care that have left 90 percent of all Americansmedically indigent. No -one questions theneed to provide abetter means for theaverageAmncricancitizentofinancehis health care.While I agree with the objective of thecatastrophic health insurance plan, I votedagainst attaching the plan to HR. 17550.When the plan was presented to the commit-tee for consideration, HR. 17550 was alreadyheavily loaded with extra, and in some in-stances nongermane amendments, and it didnot seem appropriate to add to the bill suchmassive new health program.The problem which the catastrophic healthInsurance plan seeks to meet Is pressing andmust be solved. But it does seem that theproblem could be more appropriately solvedin a broader context of national health in-surance and by considering the whole matterIn a more deliberate and careful fashion.There is little chance that any such newprogram as this can be adopted this late inthe postelection session In any event, andthe attachment of the measure to the alreadyoverburdened social security bill may tendto defeat the bill to which It is attached.The chairman Is to be congratulated foroffering a solution to the crisis and for urgingprompt action. With his interest and hisstrcng desire to see legislation enacted, thecommittee should give this matter promptattention at the beginning of the next ses-sion. At that time there will be full oppor-tunity to give attention to the financing ofcatastrophic illness costs and to the financingof all health care, including the need for anurgent and massive increase In medical andparamedical personnel and facilities.F. Federal child care corporationThere Is a great shortage of quality childcare facilities and services. We need to domore to promote the development of in-creased facilities and services. But the estab-lishment of a Federal Corporation is not theway to achieve the needed results.The Corporation under the committee billwould have the responsibility for arrangingfor child care services in the various com-munities of each State. Existing public, pri-vatenonprofit,and proprietaryfacilities would be contracted with by the Corporationto serve as child care providers. Pursuant tothe terms of the provision adopted by thecommittee, the Corporation could providechild care services in its own facilities.A fee would be charged by the Corporationfor its services, to be paid either by the con-sumer of services or by r public agency.I have grave concern about this approachto quality child care, child care Is a propersubject for local community concern andplanning. The Federal Child Care Corpora-tion approaches child care needs from thetop.Parental Involvement Iscrucial in earlychildhood programs. If the parent is activelyInvolved, there wiiJ be a positive overlap Inthe home and the community. I feel thatthis would be unlikely under the operationof the Federal Child Care Corporation.I question whether the standards set out in the bill are high enough. These standards, coupled with the striking down of local andState regulations, could lead to purely cus- todial child care.I am also concerned that with a growing number of commercial franchisers enteringthe day care field, a great tendency Would exist for the Federal Child Care CorporationCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014SENATE S 20342 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEDecember 16, 1970to contract with these franchise operations.If so, this could lead to a depersonalizationof child care services and eliminate or reducecommunity control and parental involve-ment-\u2014-the hallmarks of good child care.Child care has not received proper atten-tion from the Congress. It should be a matterof top priority for the next session of theCongress, We must soon enact major legisla-tion which will provide quality child care ona universal basis, not stigmatized by welfarealone, not controlled by private business, butcontrolled by the local community and withfull involvement of the parents.The provision In the present bill does notmeet these crucial tests.TRADEACTOF 1970I strongly opposed the attachment of theTrade Act of 1970, HR. 18970, to the socialsecurity amendments, Not only did I objectto the Trade Act on its merits, but I alsothoughtitunfortunatetoreducethe chances of passing much-needed welfare re-form and increasesinsocial security byattaching nongermane legislation.I have general objections to the overallthrust of the Trade Act, as well as specificobjections to its provisions. First, I will setforth my general reservations about the act.A. Balance of tradeIt is presently estimated that in 1970 wewill have a healthy surplus of over $3 billionin our trade balance. Last year, the surpluswas under $1 billion. In other words, thisyear our exports have been growing consid-erably more rapidly than imports.The argument that U.S. industry is be-coming increasingly noncampetitlve, whichis often made In support of the Trade Actof 1970, is invalidated by these figures. Thiswould therefore seem to be an especially poortime to risk loss of xport markets by cur-tailing imports.Another effect of quotas which would beimposed under this bill would be the retar-dation of economic growth in developing na-tions. This is at odds with our larger foreignpolicy to encourage the strength and growthof these less developed countries.B. Cost to consumersRecently. Federal Reserve Board Governor,Andrew Brimmer, said that the textile andshoe quotas In this bill would cost the con-sumer an extra $3.7 billion, and that thesecosts would be borne disproportionately bythe poor beacuse they must spend a largershare of their income on shoes and clothingthan do more affluent citizens. Whatever themerits of the industries' case\u2014and I want toreturn to this\u2014it would seem that the con-sumer would have to pay a very heavy priceIndeed for these quotas.These costs could multiply If other Con-sumer items were subjected to quotas underthe liberalized escape clause.C. Impact of inflationMuch attention has rightly been focusedon the economy in recent weeks. The infla-tionalert, the President's speech to theNAM\u2014all focus on the real danger of infla-tion. Mr. Arthur Burns, in speaking on meas-ures to combat inflation last week. suggestedthe relaxation of existing quotas on imports.This conies at a time when new inflationaryquotas would be imposed by the trade bill.We obviously cannot have it both ways. Wemust draw the line and choose between coil-trol of inflation and protectionism.Another voice raised in opposition to theimport restrictions of the bill Is that of theChamber of Commerce of the United States.The Chamber has urged that a more con-structivecourseontrade, legislationhe charted in the next session of Congress.D. Danger of retaliationI have also noted in the press an increas-ing nurnber of statements made by officialsof foreign governments, including some ofour best customers\u2014Canada, Germany, LatinAmerica, Britain, and Mexico, to name afew\u2014concerning the possible adverse conse-quences of the enactment of the trade bill.One can, of course, dismiss these statementsas bluffing, on the assumption that othercountries either could not or would not dareto curtail our exports. But is this assump-tion necessarily correct? In many instances,other countries would be able to obtain thesame goods of comparable quality from alter-native sources.Moreover, other countrieswatch their trade balance with the UnitedStates very carefully and would be very proneto reduce their purchases from us if we weretorestrict their exports to this country.Finally, I think the element of national pridewould be at work here. If they feel\u2014as theyseem to\u2014that the textile and shoe quotas,for example, are unjustified, then they willnaturally want to strike back. The risk of anold-fashioned trade war Is, in my judgment,severe. If that happens, no State will beimmune from its effects. In testimony beforethe Finance Committee, the National Cham-ber attributed 4 million American Jobs tototal United States exports. The wheat farm-ers of western Oklahoma have made Okla-homa the No. 3 wheat exporting State in theNation. A generation of eastern Oklahomanshave pinned high hopes on the ArkansasRiver Basin project which the late SenatorKerr spent so many years helping to developinto a navigable access to world commerce.All of these stand in real jeopardy in theface of restrictive trade policies.S. Renewal 0/textile negotiationsThe trade bill was approved by the HouseWays and Means Committee after the Secre-tary of Commerce announced that the UnitedStates-Japanesetextilenegotiationshad broken down and that the administrationtherefore reluctantly supported legislativequotas. In the past weeks, however, thesenegotiations have been resumed. There Is ad-niittedly no assurance that these negotia-tions will be successful either in the shortor long run. But the fact of their resump-tion is surely significant and affords furtherreason for pause in considering the tradebill. The Japanese Government feels an earlyvoluntary agreement is desirable because Ifthere is no agreement and no legislation Ispassed this year, Congress may pass evenmore restrictive legislation next year.F, Textile and shoe quotaTo the best of my knowledge, there hasbeen rio objective determination that Im-ports are causing or threatening serious in-july to the domestic textile Industry. Ofcourse, the industry itself makes vehementallegations of jobs eliminated and produc-tion lost because of imports. But has anyreasonable independent body like the UnitedSlates Tariff Commission ever come to thatconclusion? I would emphasize that I amnot asserting that there are no parts of thetextile industry that may be Injured by Im-ports. I am rather asking for evidence thatthere is a serious import-related problem af-fect i ng the en tire industry.In the face of such evidence, action Is car-thinly required. Full use of present legal rem-edies should be made. Stronger and moreagressive diplomatic initiatives by the admin-istration could result in voluntary limita-tions on specified imports,However,statisticsfrom the American'rextile Manufacturers Institute reflect thatannual textile exports have expanded by $200million over the past 12 years. More U.S. em-ployees are engaged in making textile hlllproducts now than in any year except 1968.The number of employees engaged in ap-parel manufacturing is at an all time high.Net sales, both in textiles and apparel, arethe highest ever, nearly doubling 1960 figures.Taken as a whole, these facts do not supportallegations of a severely depressed industry,requiring emergency legislation. In the ab-sence of impartial evidence of harm fromimports, I must question the need for, andthe wisdom of, unilateral textile quotas, es-pecially in view of their cost to the consumerand the possibility that the United States-Japanese negotiations may be successful.As for shoes, a task force of the adminis-tration itself concluded just several monthsago that there is no justification for quotas.Nevertheless, the President has asked theTariff Commission to determine whetherImports are causing or threatening seriousinjury to the domestic Industry. This Is theproper way in my judgment to develop asound basis for Informed and intelligent ac-tion concerning imports.G. Escape clause provis'ionsAnother provision of the trade bill that Isvery troublesomeIsthe amended escapeclause, which has traditionally authorizedthe President to Impose higher tariffs orquotas on imports found to be Injuring adomestic industry. The following aspects ofthe new escape clause are open to seriousquestion.First, under the trade bill the Tariff Com-mission would have to determine whetherimports are a \"substantial\" cause of seriousinjury. Instead of \"substantial,\" thedifference between \"primary\" and \"substan-tial\" could spell the difference between areasonable and a promiscuous use of theescape clause.Second, the bill resurrects the concept ofgeographic segmentation, which permits theTariff Commission to carve up an Industryand artificially select just that portion thatwill maximize the chance of an aiflrmatlvefinding of injury. The Tariff Commissionwould be given the license to. do so eventhough it made no economic sense and eventhough the companies and workers con-cerned were in fact able to make a successfuladjustment to whatever Import problem mayhave existed. One of the Important featuresof the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 was Its repeal of the geographic segmentation pro-vision. Its resurrectiosi is a major threat toan enlightened foreign trade policy.H. Foreign import restrictionsThe committee has gone even further thanthe House bill in making sectIon 252 of theTrade Expansion Act of 1962 a protectionistdevice. At the present time, sectIon 252 au- thorizes\u2014but does not require\u2014the Presi-dent to impose new restrictions on Importsfrom countries that are Illegally or unrea- sonably restricting our exports. The key Is-sue, of course, is who determines whether a foreign import restriction is illegal or un- reasonable. The right of any member of theGAP'S to impose slew restrictions Is severelyrestricted by that agreement\u2014as it shouldbe if any order in international trade Is to be preserved.Under the committee's bill, the Secretaryof Commerce would determine if a foreignImport restrictionisillegalor unreason- able, If he made an affirmative finding, thePresident would be authorized to work out a solution with the foreign country concerned.If he could not in 3 months, then he wouldhave to take retaliatory action. This Is\u2014pure and simple\u2014another radical violationof the GATT and another example of a blindattitude that somehow the United Statescan flout the rules of the game and get awaywith it.I.Status 0/GATTThe committee struck the new separateauthorization for appropriations to financeour annual contribution to the GATr. Thiswill probably not seriously jeopardize futureappropriations, since there is a general au-thorization available in tile organic legisla-tion of the Department of State. But It Isobviously a vote of no confidence In the onlyInternational organization that offers any December 16, 1970hopeof maintaining and strengthening afair world trading system.The committee struck the provision on theground that it would give 'statutory recogni-tion of the GAI\"I', which has never been sub-mitted to the Congress for approval.\" Thefact is that the GATT is a valid executiveagreement, concluded pursuant to the au-thority of section 350 of the Tariff Act of1930. As a statutory executive agreement, Itneed not, of course, be submitted to Con-gress for approval. This question dealt withextensively in a 1956 memorandum of theLegal Adviser of the State Department tothe then chairman of the Ways and MeansCommittee (see H. Rept. 2007, 84th Cong.,second sess.,113\u2014131(1956) ).J,American selling priceThe committee struck the provision in theHouse version that would have provided forthe elimination of the American selling price(ASP) system of customs valuation as itrelates to benzenold chemicals. This systemhas been found to be without justificationby both the Johnson and Nixon administra-tions, and the United States Is pledged toseeking its abolition in one of the agreementsconcluded in the Kennedy Round. If thissystem is not to be abolished, there is little.If any, hope of making further progress forsome years to come in the field of nontariffbarriers. Once again, the blind approach Is atwork: Let other countries remove their non-tariff barriers, while we stand pat.K. Failure to take posUive actionBeyond the positive and enormous harmdone by the bill, it also fails to seize criticalopportunities to move ahead:(1) Tariff-Reducing Authority.\u2014The Housebillbyclearlegislativehistory and thecommittee'sblUbyexpressstatutory language would give the President new tariffreducing authority only for the purpose ofgrantingcompensatorytariffconcessions when we Increase import restrictions underthe escape clause or by some other means.In other words, this is an authority thatat best permits us to stand in the sameplace, but envisages no further net reduc-on in tariffs.The Kennedy Round was concluded In1967 and the lasttariff reductions agreedto will take place on January 1, 1972. Isn'tit time to give the President the authorityto start moving again in lowering trade bar-riers? How can the momentum of tradeliberalization be maintained 11 the past lead-er of that effort is powerless? And especiallyin the trade field, the absence of progressonly invites retrogression.(2) Non-Tariff Barriers\u2014Even with theprovisionauthorizing theeliminationof ASP, billfailed to provide fornegotiations on nontariff barriers, thougheveryone agrees that this is the single mostserious problem In the trade field. As itstands now, the President must act at hisperil if he acts at all. On the one hand, hecan negotiate on nontariff barriers withoutany prior congressional approval and sim-ply hope that the Congress will provide thenecessary implementing legislation after thefact. The handling of ASP, of course, affordslittle encouragement. On the other hand,the President can request specific authoritybefore beginning any particular negotiationson non-tariff barriers. The Congress maythen so circumscribe his authority as torender it valueless or give him none at all.since it has not yet seen what reciprocaladvantages it might afford the United States.The only way I can see out of this dilem-ma is to have the Congress give the Pres-ident, perhaps In the form of a resolution.the \"license\" to negotiate, while teservingnil of its authority to pass upon any neces-sary implementing legislation. This wouldat least give the President the encourage-ment he does not now have to tackle non-CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEtariffbarriersand attempt to commence aninternational negotiation on the subject.L. ConclusionThe total effect of the trade bill is,in my judgment, antagonistic to constructiveways of dealing with the current problemsin International trade. It assumes that theUnited States can take unjustified and in-dccci illegal actions and somehow get awaywith them, without provoking retaliation orundermining the world trading system. Thisseems to me to be a hopelessly naive andfalse assumption. It is my opinion that ifthe Senate will seriously consider how harm-ful the present trade bill is and how greatisthe need for a constructive trade bill, then we may still have the time to avertthe appalling consequences of a return toprotectionism bothinthiscountry and throughout the world.I re-emphasize that I am concerned aboutthe allegations of serious injury resultingfrom imports being voiced by the textile andother industries. Present law provides forremedies in such cases. Full use of presentprovisions should be employed where need isindicated. Adjustment assistance should beused to ease the conversion of industries andjobs in cases requiring such relief. Diplo-matic negotiotions should be pressed. Lastly,the Congress should carefully and deliberatelyconsider additional thoughtful trade legisla-tion, which is in keeping with our past pol-icies of free trade and which does not violateinternational agreements which we have pre-viously made.I attempted twice in the committee to havethe trade bill stricken from the social secur-ity bill. I will renew this effort on the floorof the Senate. Should this motion fail, I intend to offer a series of amenciments toimprove the Trade Act.Final conclusionAllof the legislative proposals includedIn HR. 17550 are in need of thoughtful legis-lative consideration. My opposition to spe-cific proposals in the bill by no moans in-dicated a lack of concern fOr responsible ac-tion on the problems raised thereby. But,it is too late in this post-election Congressto hope for any fruitful action on so manydiverse issues placed under the same um-brella.Therefore itis imperative, as I have setforth in these separate views, that the Son-ata in the remaining days devote its time toimproving our social security and relatedprorams and to meaningful reform of ourfailing welfare system. The other matterscan and should be set aside for considerationby the next Congress.Mr. HARRIS.

However, I did billion, lion over existing law, or $3.3 billion The Finance Committee by a majority more than that which was provided in feel that the Senate had a right to work vote increased these benefits. Instead of the House bill, its will and that after reasonable debate leaving the benefits at 5 percent, they That will be the question before the we should be able to proceed to a vote. S 20450 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEDecember 17, 1970That effort is a matter of record andhistory now.We were unable to get such a consentagreement. I do not criticize those whofelt they could not consent. I am surethey had good and valid reasons.I am going to make another efforthere to get some semblance of reason-able order in consideration of this mas-sive piece of legislation. The bill itselfcovers 546 pages.The Finance Committee has workedon this bill for many months.I have never seen that committee, inthe period of my 20 years in which I havebeen a Member, devote more time to astudy and analysis of a bill than it hasto the various sections of this bill and allof its ramifications.The bill is now before the Senate. Ithas been pointed out that we have a sit-uation here dealing with some very high-ly controversial measures. We have thequestion in the bill involving the catas-tophic insurance. We have the question ofthe trade act, which is title 3 of the bill.This is something about which Membersof the Senate on both sides of the ques-tion have very strong feelings. Othershave very strong feelings about the f am-ily assistance plan.We are in this situation parliamentary-wise. Any of the amendments\u2014the tradeamendment,thefamilyassistance amendment, or any other amendment\u2014could be offered to one of the committeeamendments.The problem is, however, that If theyare offered to any committee amend-ment, that would be an amendment inthe second degree. Therefore, it wouldnot be subject to any modification orverification even though in the discus-sion it may be pointed out to the mem-bership and even the sponsors of theamendmentthatthereshouldbe changes in the amendment.In the discussion last night with boththe chairman of the committee and theSenator from Oklahoma, who had someamendments that he wished to offer tothe Bennett-Riblcoff amendment, It waspointed out that he would be precludedfrom offering them under such a par-liamentary situation.I, too, would have some amendmentsto offer. I would also be precluded. Ithink it would be mOst unfortunate forthe Senate to get itself into such aparliamentary situation.Mr. President, in order to show theSenate what kind of a parliamentarysnarl we can get into, and almost gotinto at this time, I knowat least two proposals that Senators were con-sidering offering as amendments to thefirst committee amendment on pages1, 2, 3, and 4. The Committee amend-ments have no substance. They merelychange the section number.It has been suggested that at theend of that amendment the Trade Actcould be offered and would be in order.or the family assistance plan could beoffered and would be in order. Neitherwould be subject to an amendment. Theywould be voted on on the merits.Some might say that Is simple enoughto get a vote. However, after the yeasand nays have been ordered on anamendment to an amendment all anyone Senator would have to do would beto stand up and ask for a division. Wewould then have had exactly 68 votesbefore we could vote on the amendment.Those committee amendments after thedivision would require a vote on eachline, because they are separable. Eachone is to strike out a different line.True, it does not mean anything, butit would have required a rollcall voteand would have put the Senate in a moresilly posture than it is now, if that ispossible.For that reason, last night I made aunanimous-consentrequestthatap- proved this amendment and preventedthe Senate from getting into that ridicu-lous situation.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, will theSenator yield?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I yield.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, if I cor-rectly understand the situation, ifa Senator wanted to amend the first com-mittee amendment, which would simplystrike the table of contents in the bill, hecould have insisted on a motion to sepa-rate. That would have required the Sen-ate to have a separate vote to strike onevery single item in the table Of con-tents. That alone would have required68 rolicall votes, if it had been insistedon.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. The Sen-ator is correct. And after that they wouldbe subject to a quorum call between eachone and a motion to table on that. Wewould have two rollcall votes. So therewould be 136 rollcall votes and 136 quo-rum calls.I point that out to show how we couldget into such a ridiculous picture.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, if a Senatorwanted to:offer an amendment to thesimple committee amendment to strikethe table of contents, any Senator whodid not want that amendment to cometo a vote could insist on 136 rollcall votesand 136 quorum calls before we ever gotto a vote on the amendment.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. He could.But it is even simpler than that becausewhoever offered that amendment to theamendment, whether It be on the tradesection or family assistance, would wanta rollcall vote and that would be appli-cable to the entire package; and all theywould have to do would be to request adivision, and we would have 68 rollcallvotes. I hope that will not happen andthat we can proceed In an orderly man-ner. If such an amendment, whether Itbe for family assistance or an amend-ment dealing with any other subject, isoffered to any committee amendmentthat Is in the second degree It is not sub-ject to any amendment or any variation.This Is not good legislative practice.Last night the chairman mentioned,and It had been mentioned in committee.the possibility of getting unanimous con-sent to have amendments considered enbloc. In that case any Senator who gotrecognition could offer his amendmentand have It voted on up or down; hisamendment then would be subject toamendment In the second degree\u2014thefamily assistance plan or whatever itmight be, would be, in effect, to the orig-inal text because that is the way wewould be considering it. That would givean opportunity to the Senator from Ok-lahoma or anyone else who wanted to of-fer amendments to amendments; theycould offer them to the committee billas we have done many times before.There are proposals in this measurethat I do not like and that I hope willnot be agreed to. I shall discuss thosein due course. It is in recognition of thisfact that I have worked over night aridtalked with several members, and Ithink we have somewhat of a concensusof opinion. I have not talked to every-one, but I believe we have somewhat ofa concensus of opinion that it would bebetter for all concerned to have theunanimous consent granted that thecommittee amendments be consideredand agreed to en bloc and as agreed tobe considered as original text for thepurpose of amendment.I have asked the Parliamentarian towrite out this request so it would be inthe usual form. In that manner anyonewho has the floor could have his amend-ment offered.Mr. RIBICOFF. Mr. President, willthe Senator yield?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I yieldwithout losing my right to the floor.Mr. RrBICOFF. The Senator fromUtah (Mr. BENNETT) and I are veryanxious to have a definitive vote on thefamily assistance plan. We recognize theparliamentary situation that ifthese amendments are not adopted en bloc andmade original text that the amendmentwe would offer would not be subject toamendment. The family assistance planis so complex and has so many facetsthat I do not have a feeling of self-righteousness that we should depriveother Senators from offering their ownconcepts and ideas. I know the Senatorfrom Oklahoma has many thoughts ofhis own. The Senator from Idaho hasmany thoughts of his own, and otherSenators have thoughts on how thisamendment should be reported.Consequently, in all fairness to theSenate and to this measure, we wouldhope that the proposal of the Senatorfrom Delaware would be agreedto without objection. If this were the case,then the amendment I would offer\u2014andI would hope to receive recognition fromthe Chair at the earliest possible mo-ment\u2014would be an amendment in thefirst degree, giving each Senator an op-portunity to offer his amendment and Inthis way we could have a complete dis-cussion of a most complex subject.I believe this is the fairest way to han-dle the proposal and to that end wecould go forward to a vote on the familyassistance program before we adjournsine die on January 3.Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, will theSenator yield?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I willyield in a moment but I do want to pointout that I am not doing this necessarilyto expedite that particular proposal. Asthe Senator knows I would just as soonsee that proposal defeated. However, Iam perfectly willing to take my chanceson why I think that proposal would notbe good. I am perfectly willing to do thatand let the Senate vote. December 17, 1970 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATE S 20451But in the meantime, if it is going tobe adopted it would be better to have itimproved if we find improvements canbe made. It is better to be in a posturewhere we can make a change in it, andunder the other situation we would bealmost locked in.Mr. RIBICOFF. The Senator is cor-rect.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I appre-ciate what the Senator has just said. AsI said, every Member of the Senate wouldbe on equal footing so he could get rec-ognition and offer whatever amendmenthe wanted to offer.Mr. President, I yield to the Senatorfrom Oklahoma, and I would like to askto yield to anyone else who wants to com-ment on this without my losing my rightto the floor.I yield to the Senator from Oklahoma.Mr. HARRIS. I thank the distinguishedSenator. The Senator, has, indeed, talkedwith a number of Senators, including me,and he has indicated his intention tomake this request today to adopt thecommittee amendments en bloc andmake them original text. I think that isthe orderly way to proceed.I hope we can pass the social securityrelated matters in the bill and that wecan pass welfare reform\u2014real welfarereform\u2014this year, and get the amend-ment of the Senator from Connecticutand the Senator from Utah in amend-able form. What the Senator Is askingfor is a way to do that in an orderlymanner; and then, those of us who wantto amend various sections of the bill,and strike the trade provision, as I do,would have that opportunity to do so.I join in the request of the Senatorfrom Delaware and I hope it can beagreed to as the orderly way to proceed.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I thankthe Senator. Some Senators, and to befrank, I, personally, was reluctant to en-ter into this, as the chairman knows dur-ing discussions In committee, becausethere are a few sections on which Iwanted direct roilcall votes.There Is this difference which we allrecognize. It takes one more vote to strikesomething from a bill than to put it in.Then, if it is going to rise or fall on onevote I do not know that it is important.The main thing is to get it to a vote.Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President. will theSenator yield?Mr. WILLIAMS ofDelaware.Mr. President, I yield to the Senator fromNew York on the same conditions.Mr. JAVITS. I would like to advise theSenator that I shall object to his requestand if he will allow me, I would like tostate the reasons. Will the Senator yieldfor that purpose?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Yes, Iyield without losing my right to the floor.Mr. JAVITS. I understand.In the first place, let me state that Iwas not informed of this unanimous-consent proposal, and that I heard of Itbecause one hears about everything Inthis Chamber. I hope very much that Inthe course of the debate on this bill, whenthere will be lots of things asked for byme and other Senators, that we shouldreally, in all fairness, start the practiceof advising Members who other Membersknow are deeply interested in whateveris going to be proposed.We were told yesterday by the ma-jority leader there need to be no worryon that score. This is hardly an auspici-ous beginning.Second, I did not concoct the plan toinclude social security, medicare, medic-aid, a massive and historic trade bill, andfamily assistance all in one bill. Nor didI develop the idea of not filing a cleanbill, which the committee could havedone, but filing a bill which is full ofamendments so that you block the Sena-tor from Oklahoma (Mr. HARRIS), me,and any other Member who may have anamendment because as the Senator fromConnecticut (Mr. RIBIcoFF) mentionedit is all done in the third degree.So the doctrine of original sin doesnot make me feel guilty at all. This isthe way the Senate Finance Committeewanted it. If the view of the Senate isgoing to be expressed in a fair way it isgoing to be fair to both sides. The Sen-ate Finance Committee wanted it thisway, this is the way the Committee onFinance reported the bill-to the floor. Themembers of the committee must now beprepared to live with their decision. Youasked for every one of these amendmentsto be voted on. You did; I did not. There-fore, if I require you to adhere to youroriginal intention what is wrong withthat? The Members of this Chamberknow full well I want the family assist-ance plan considered as well as social se-curity. But I will not be and I do notthinkanybody.elseshould be \"overweaned\"\u2014to use a kind word, becausethe trade bill is very bad legislation andwe are being denied the opportunity toacquaint the country with this fact andbeing denied the opportunity to considertrade legislation in the way that it shouldbe considered.With all respect to- the Senator, whois trying to make the best of a bad situa-tion, I ajn compelled to object.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. If I mayreply, I reply to the Senator from NewYork, my colleague and friend, withmixed emotions. What he is saying hewants done is exactly what I would liketo accomplish, but I do not want to takethe responsibilityfor underwriting afilibuster to defeat the bill. When thetrade bill was offered on this bill I votedagainst it. I thought it was wrong to takea bill which came from the House andadd it to the social security bill. I votedthat way and will be voting that way onthe Senate floor. There is no questionabout that.On the other hand, I also voted againstattaching the family assistance plan.which was rejected by our committee onthree occasions, one time being rejectedby a vote of 14 to 1, another time by avote of 10 to 6, and I forget the rollcallvote the third time, but the majority ofthe committee refused to approve thatbill.The Senator from New York, much asI respect him, is trying to add the familyassistance plan to this bill, which planwas defeated by our committee, but heis not willing to abide by the majoritywill of the committee which put theother one in. I am willing to abide bythe will of the majority of the committeeand the Senate in both cases.I personally know no easier way to de-feat the bill\u2014in fact, there is no easierway\u2014than to have a vote on every sepa-rate amendment. There are 280\u2014oddamendments in this measure. The Sen-ator cansit down and count themhimself.If the Senator from New York insistsI know it will be carried out, because Irespect him highly. If that is his wishthen I will carry out his instructions, andwhen we get through we will have had280 rollcall votes which will be recon-sidered, and the number of rollcail voteswill double to 560. I hope, if the Senatorfrom New York wants to filibuster the billhe will do it differently than by rollcallvotes.I am only pleading with him to goalong. I will support a motion to strikethis trade section, and I do not see whyhe would object. I have been here only 24years, and I do not claim to know asmuch about the parliamentary situationas the Senator from New York, but I justmight hazard a guess that he might de-feat his purpose by insisting on object-ing to this request.I would hate to see us get into such asnarl, and I plead with him to reconsiderhis position.Before I yield to the Senator fromLouisiana .(Mr. LONG) let me add thatcertainly the leadership of the Senate isnot necessarily on my side in these mat-ters. The Presiding Officer Will be theone to recognize Senators. I shall notcontrol that. I do not have as much con-trol over who is recognized as he willhave. I am going to make my brief re-marks here today, and I am trying to re-store some semblance of order.I call attention to the fact that yes-terday we almost got into the situationwhere we would have had to have 135rollcall votes before we got to the meas-ure, just because of what could have hap-pened. I do not want to see the Senate getin a posture which, as I said earlier,would make us appear more silly thanthat posture in which we are now ap-pearing with five filibusters running atthe same time. I would say we are goingto have to get hats for the filibusters. Weare going to have to get five differenthats with different colors, and we are go-ing to have to number the filibusters be-cause we are getting to a situation wherewe do not know which side we are onand whether we are for them or not. Ihave never seen such a state of confusionas exists in the Senate today. I know thatif this procedure is insisted upon we willbe in an even greater state of confusion.I have said repeatedly I am not goingto filibuster this bill. I think there Is logicenough in the argument I can presentthat it will persuade the Senate to defeatthe family assistance plan, or what isbetter referred to as the guaranteed an-nual income. I am an optimist. I thinkI can defeat It. I will take my chances,and if I do not I shall congratulate theSenator from Connecticut. But I am per-fectly willing to abide by the decision S 20452 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEDecember 17,1970of the Senate. I would consider it anindication of weakness on my part if Iwere afraid to face the Senate on a vote.I am not. I welcome the opportunity.My position vs sustained in the Fi -nanceCommittee. The plan was defeatedby a 14-to-i ratio, and each time theFinance Committee overwhelmingly rec-ognized the argument against starting onsuch an unsound plan as this. The com-mittee sustained my position. I thinkthe Senate will do likewise. If I am wrongI shall congratulate Senators and peg-haps go home and, who knows, we mayall live on welfare.I say let us vote. If Senators are notafraid of their positions let us vote. I amnot afraid to vote on it. I will vote againstit, but I will be there. But I say let usvote, whatever the results.I yield to the chairman of the com-mittee.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, just to makeclear that what the committee has doneis the usual way of doing business, mayI remind the Senator and the Senatethat last year we had a revenue billin which we had so many amendmentsthat the Senator from Louisiana, thechairman of the committee, asked thatthe whole bill be drafted as a substitutepackage for the House-passed bill. Wedid it that way last year. Some did notagree with that procedure. That is notthe usual way of doing business, I mustadmit.In that case Senators then proceededto offer amendments first to the Housebill. We had two tiers of amendments,amendments in the first and second de-gree being offered to the House bill, andthen amendments in the first and seconddegree being offered to the committeebill, with the result that we had two tiersof amendments, each with a second tieron top of them, all of them being sub-ject to to be called up and debated. Thatproved to be a much more cumbersomeway of proceeding than the way that isbeing proposed.With regard to revenue bills, the Com-mittee on Finance cannot report out aclean bill because the Constitution doesnot permit the Senate to originate reve-nue bills. They must originate in theHouse. The SenateIslimited to thepower to amend. What the Senate Fi-nance Committee can do, within thepower to which the Senate Is limited, isto amend such bills, be it in the natureof a committee substitute or be it throughamendments. ThebillIssubjectto amendment, and the amendment is sub-ject to amendment in both tiers, depend-ing on the order in which Senators wantto call their amendments up.So the fact Is that on a big revenuebill, one as controversial as this one is,with so many matters to be consideredthe possibilities of amendments are limit-less, and even though we in the commit-tee limit ourselves, we cannot limit Sen-ators. They have a right to offer amend-ments.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. That isright. I would like to point this out fur-ther, which Is a parliamentary fact oflife fr'om whicli we cannot escape. Wecan proceed any way we wish\u2014the fam-fly assistance plan can be offered atthe end of some comjnlttee amendmentat this time or whenever a Senator getsrecognized, but there is no possible par-liamentary situation that can he ob-tained in the Senate whereby this bill canpass without Senators standing up andvoting on the trade section. There is noway it can be done except by unanimousconsent to strike out that section; andwe know that consent will not be ob-tained so there is no possible way to do it.So ifall certain Senators want is avote on the family assistance plan withthe clear understanding and knowledgethat it is not going to become law, thenthey are doing so with tongue in cheek,voting for something they never intendto become law. I say let them stand upsand acknowledge their hypocrisy pub-licly, because that would be the mosthypocritical action that could be taken.I repeat, there is no possible way\u2014and I will yield to any Senator who canchallenge that statement\u2014even if the family assistance plan is added to thebill, to get a vote on final passage of thebill without first standing up and votingon the trade and other sections. It can-not be done.There is no way it can be done. SoSenators would not be yielding any rightsthat they have by this agreement. In myopinion, to proceed otherwise would beto acknowledge that all we want is a voteon the family assistance plan with thefull knowledge and consent that it is going down the drain; and 1 will be aparty to no such hypocrisy.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, will theSenator yield?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I yield.Mr. LONG. The Senator recognizes,does he not, that simply to agree to thecommittee amendments en bloc does notmean that the Senate is for the com-mittee amendments? It just means thatwe will regard them as original text soas to expedite the completion of actionon this bill.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Certainlynot, because some of the amendments, asthe Senator knows, I would be votingagainst; and I shall be offering amend-ments to strike out some of these sec-tions, because, as the Senator knows, Ido not support some of them, and I havenot changed my opinion. When anamendment to strike out the trade sec-tion is in order I expect to support it.But that is not the issue here. We havea right to vote, whether we expect to winor lose, and I can certainly see us get-ting into a parliamentary snarl here.That is the reason why, as I said before,I arranged to be recognized first heretoday because I hope I can persuade theSenate of the logic of what I shall sug-gest.Whoever the Chair recognizes in thedays ahead under this procedure canmove to table any amendment that isoffered. A Senator can make a motionto lay it on the table immediately afterit is offered, and the Chair can recognizethe next man.I shall be frank with the Senator thatI do not see where he is gaining muchby objecting to this request. I should liketo have votes on four or five of commit-tee amendments; and in fact, as I havestated, I shall insist on it.I shall behappy to designate those amendmentswhich I should like to vote on and haveatimelimitation on theparticular amendments; but I can get recorded be-fore this bill is passed by offering anamendment to strike. That is easy, andthe only thing I have lost is one vote;and I am optimistic that we have enoughvotes anyway.Iyieldtothe Senator from Con-necticut.Mr. RIBICOFF. Mr. President, it isironical to have a supposed enemy of thisprogram, who desires to defeat familyassistance, trying to work out a programto give us an opportunity to vote, andthedistinguished Senator from NewYork, who is an outstanding friend andsupporter of the family assistance pro-gram, putting the Senate in the positionwhere the family assistance programwill be defeated.The Senator from Delaware, from thestart, has been consistently against thefamily assistance program. The Senatorfrom New York has indicated that he de-sires to be a cosponsor of the family as-sistance program. The irony of the entiresituation is that it is a Republican Pres-ident who has sent this proposal to Con-gress, and it is a Democrat on this sidewho is doing everythinghe can to see thatthe family assistance program is passed.The Senator from Delaware had beenadamant from thetart about having aseries of votes and using the parliamen-tary procedure to prevent a vote on thefamily assistance plan.Afterconversationanddiscussion among many of us who were interested,we tried to work out a method of proce-dure to give every Member of this bodyan opportunity to try to perfect this pro-posal. I know that the Senator from NewYork would like to see adopted manyof the proposals that the Senator fromOklahoma would like to submit. That ismy understanding, and if I mistake theSenator from New York I would like tobe corrected. I was aware at all timesthat the Senator from Oklahoma had aseries of amendments on which the Sen-ator from New York saw eye to eye withhim. I thought, out of fairness to everyMember of this body, we had to get our-selves into a parliamentary situation togive the Senator from Oklahoma andevery Member of this body an oppor-tunity to have a vote on this amendments,up or down.Now we are in a situation, of course,where we have come back to where westarted. I shall still try to get recogni-tion, if unanimous consent is not agreedto, to offer the Ribicoff-Bennett propo-sal. If it is done that way, then we canonly debate the Ribicoff-Bennett pro-posal; It is not subject to amendmentby any other Member of this body.I have a telegram that was sent tome, signed by six former Secretaries ofHealth, Education, and Welfare, Repub-lican and Democratic: Oveta Cuip Hob-by, Marion B. Folsom, Arthur S. Flem-ming, John W. Gardner, Wilbur J. Co-hen, and Robert H. Finch, telling methat they approve the Ribicoff-Bennettproposal, and they believe it to be a ma-jor step toward the urgently needed re-form of the current welfare system. December 17,1970CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014SENATE S 20453J cannot agree with the Senator fromDelaware when he says that this is alla charade. I recognize how slim thechance will be to finally adopt the fam-ily assistance program, or any otherpart of this bill. The clock is indeed run-ning out on us. But here is a programthat the President of the United Stateshas had before Congress and the coun-try for a year and a half. It has beena controversial program. Hearings havebeen held in the House of Representa-tives and in this body, and much timehas been spent.I believe it becomes very important forthe country to find out how the Senateactually feels. I would hope that this billcould be passed in sufficient time for aconference, but ifit cannot be passedsufficiently in advance to permit a con-ference and for final approval by Jan-uary 3, at least we will have indicatedsufficiently to the Nation that Congresswith the President of the United States,makes a commitment toward eliminatingpoverty which would enable us, early inthe next session, in January or February,without further hearings, to take up theSocial Security and Family Assistanceprograms.I would sin'erely hope that the dis-tinguished Senator,from New York, whodoes not have to yield to any man in hisconcern for those in poverty, those peo-ple on welfare, and the most unfortu-nate part of our population, would con-sider what is happening as a result of hisobjection.Iwould hope the Senatorwould reconsider his objection to per-mitting these amendments to be adopteden bloc, and then letting the Senate pro-ceed in an orderly way to discuss, to de-bate, and to amend the family-assistanceprogram, and proceed to a final vote.Mr. WILLIAMS ofDelaware.Mr. President, I certainly hope the Senatorand I can obtain that agreement. I donot see how it can possibly ever get to avote unless there Is some kind of agree-ment here in the Senate. As I pointedout before, surely we can get to a vote onthe family assistance plan. Senators canoffer amendments to anything whichmay come before the Senate. But wecannot get away from the fact that wecannot vote on title IV until after thevote on title III if we follow the regularprocedure, or vote on title V until wehave disposed of the other four.I am just trying to get some order andget it where at least we may be able toachieve the results of a vote.I would like not to be tied up here allof Christmas week, but I am afraid if wedo not follow such a procedure that Iswhat Is going to happen. I shall yield ina moment to the Senator from Iowa. HeIs one Senator I have been talking withwho has made the point that he did notwant any agreement entered Into thatwould preclude him from the right to of-fer amendments to the Bennett-Rlblcoffamendment; and other Senators, If theyhave amendments to be offered, have aright to be heard and have them con-sidered. I hope we can obtain this agree-ment.But I yield now to the Senator fromIowa, without relinquishing my right tothe floor.Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, I thankmy friend from Delaware. I commend theSenator from Delaware for what he istrying to do. However, in view of thecomments from the Senator from NewYork, I would suggest\u2014and I hope theSenator from New York will commenton it\u2014that instead of going whole hog, soto speak, and asking the Senate to con-sider all of the committee amendmentsen bloc, we proceed by asking unanimousconsenttoconsiderthecommitteeamendments en bloc by title, so that theconcern of the Senator from New Yorkabout the trade title can be made mani-fest in due course.In the meantime, we can make' someprogress by taking up the other precedingtitles, giving us a chance to debate thefamily assistance plan and welfare re-form, and if the Senator from New Yorkwill agree to that, then I think we carstart moving.Of course, if he will not agree to it, weare right back where we started from.I suggest that this may be a midgroundon which we could all agree.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. The dif-ficulty with that is we cannot ask unan-imous consent to consider title 4 untilwe hit title 3, and the Trade Act is inthe middle; that cannot be changed. Itis there. I can see why the Senator fromNew York or those who oppose theTrade Act would noe want to agreeto titles 1 and 2 en bloc, because if wedid the Trade Act would immediatelybe before the Senate. I am not trying tofool anyone on this.Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, will theSenator yield?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I yield,without losing my right to the floor.Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I haveheard with the greatest of interest theviews of ray colleagues, and I am not ob-durate or difficult at all.As to the gentle irony of the Senatorfrom Connecticut, I respect and admirehim greatly, and I yield to no one in myaffection for him. But it is not unusual toput the screws on a Member who has thetemerity to stand up against other Mem-bers who want to do something they wantto do. The Senator from Connecticut maynot have the same feeling I do about thetrade title, which I think could be dis-astrous to our country. I believe that Icost the aged nothing\u2014indeed, I get themsomething: because, instead of being tiedup in a whole package which is boundto have a disastrous effect, they ultimate-ly will be extracted from it and will havetheir social security; and I hope verymuch that we will have that and thefamily assistance plan for the poor ofthe country considered, as they should be,alone and on their merits, without be-ing used as a Judas goat for the tradebill.I understand the feeling of every Sen-ator, and he has an absolute right to saywhat he does and to make It as toughfor me as possible. But every Senatorhasto obey his conscience as to what heconsiders to be the highest Interests ofthe people in his State and of the Nation,and I think I have done so In this.As to the statement made by myfriend, the Senator from Delaware, as tothe state of confusion, this is war. War isalways confused. Yet, somehow or other,great captains have emerged. Somehowor other, when the'confusion is over,something decisive has happened. I havedeep confidence that something decisiveis going to happen here, but there willbe a little confusion to start with.So, with all respect, I am not at all dis-mayed by these pleas and entreaties. Iknow that the Senators know they donot have to make them to me. It doesnot make any difference, anyway But Ishould like to explain my own position,because I think that is owed to the Sen-ate and is important.In the first place, I do not stand alone,and I knew nothing about this until thisminute, except by rumor. Therefore, thevery least\u2014and itis always the mostprofitable way one could do it\u2014would beto tell a Member such as myself: \"Weare going to ask for this. We think It isgood for you. Call a meeting of your sup-porters and find out whether or not theyagree with you, and come to the floorwith a position which is reflective of theview of your side.\"This was not done. I am caught flat-footed as it were. I have to object ornot object, or the cow is out of the barn.Second, this is a lameduck Congress.A new Congress has been elected, whichwill come into office on January 3. Yet,the attempt is being made to decide mas-sive questions of national policy withina few days, and that is all we have in alame duck Congress, the meeting ofwhich itself is highly questionable\u2014cer-tainly on such profound issues as thosewe face now.It is one thing to complete our busi-ness. We have appropriation bills or other bills on which we have been work-ing a long time, which were voted by theHouse and the Senate and on which thejudgment has been made, and we aretrying to reconcile differences, and soforth. But these are brand new things,enormous things, of greatest consequenceto the future history of our country and,in the case of the trade bill, perhaps theworld. Yet, we are now under great pres-sure. Otherwise, we would be unkind tothe poor, who have to live in this world,too, unless we go right along now andvote these things out under limitation ofdebate of hours or by arrangements suchas the Senator suggests, without even anopportunity to consult one's colleagueswho are similarly minded.I would most respectfully suggest that,instead of putting Senators such as my-self on the spot, which is not fair, but Iwill object\u2014I am telling the Senate nowthat I will object.I think It Is very unwise and unfair,and I think that Senators such as myselfshould have an opportunity to get to-gether with their fellows and come intomorrow and say whether we agree ordisagree and why, In some kind of co-ordinated way, Instead of being facedwith this on the floor; and then thereare entreaties and the fact that I, too,am devoted to the FAP, and so forth,on the theory that one has to yield hIsjudgment and his conscience and say,\"Yes.\"I am terrible sorry, but my people did S 20454 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEDecember 17,1970not send me here to have that kind ofbrain or that kind of will.Mr. RIBICOFF. Mr. President, will theSenator yield?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I shouldlike to reply to the Senator from NewYork.I am going to make a copy of his speechand use it later when we get into debateon the family assistance plan because hehas expressed my sentiments exactlyabout how unsound it is to bring up pro-posals which have been rejected by thecommittee and which are not germaneto the bill before the Senate. I thankhim, because it is a much better speechthan I shall be able to prepare, and I amgoing co deliver it, with his consent ofcourse, and I will credit him later.He has madeastrong argumentagainst approving the family assistanceplan.As to the question that confusion willresult and that the cow will be out ofthe barn, I will say that if this objectionpersists I am afraid it will not be a mat-ter of the cow out of the barn hut thebulls in the china shop before we getout of here today, because I can see amess created.I would repeat this point. We cannotget final passage on the family assistanceplan, the social security increases, or anyother proposal in this bill until the Sen-ate first calls the roll on the Trade Act.It cannot be done. There is no possibleway under Senate Rules unless there isunanimous consent to strike the TradeAct out and there is unanimous consentthat no one will offer any amendmentsdealing with the Trade Act. We knowthat that is not possible.If we are going to be on notice thatthis is going to be filibustered regardlessof whatever we do this late in the ses-sion I would most respectfully suggestto the leadership to pull this bill downunless we can get an agreement thatthere is going to be some orderly processhere. I would dislike sitting here for thenext 12 or 14 days\u2014I will not mind itso much because I have quite a little timeahead of me in which to rest and enjoyit while the rest of the Senators are backhere working, I do not see the idea ofsitting here the next 12 or 14 days, spin-ning cur wheels at Christmastime, givingthe impression to 13 or 14 million elderlypeople,We're going to give you a 10-percent increase in your social securitybenefits: we're going to raise your mini-mum to a hundred dollars; we're goingto give you a cost of living escalation:we're going to give you the family assist-ance plan,\" when 100 Senators know thatis not going to develop. Let us not kidthem. This is Christmas. It is cruel tothese people who have no knowledge asto what we are doing: it is cruel to mis-lead them. I think it is a hoax.I hope that the Senate in the closingdays ofthissessionwillhave moreChristmas spirit inits bones than topromise this to a lot of people who needit and to whom Senators know they willnot be able to deliver it.I say let us lay it aside If we are notgoing to vote on It. I am willing to voteon it.Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, willthe Senator yield?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I yield.Mr. MANSFIELD. I think it is abouttime for the Senator to stop, because myheart is beginning to bleed.All I want to say is that the leader-ship will not pull this bill down. We willstay with it until a decision, if possible, isreached one way or the other.In the meantime, because of the timewe are wasting and the filibustering go-ing on, and the filibustering within thefilibusters, the minutes fly by, the hoursare passing, and the days are rapidly fad-ing into the distance of the new year.We have approximately 10 days left inwhich to attend to this matter and othermatters. We have at least six filibusters,perhaps seven now, of various sorts goingon. We are looking foolish.I find no fault in serving in a lameduckCongress, may I say, because evei'y Mem-ber is elected to serve as a representa-tive of the people until noon on the 3d ofJanuary next year. I do not denigrateany Member who is serving out his lastmonths\u2014in this instance, his last days\u2014-because he is carrying out his respon'sibilities; he is performing his duties ashe is supposed to.I am wholeheartedly in accord with theproposal made by the distinguished Sen-ator from Delaware that the committeeamendments be considered and approveden block. In that way, we can make someprogress and stand a small chance ofdisposing of the proposed legislation.Without that, there is no chance.Mr. WILLIAMS ofDelaware.Mr. President, I do not know that it wouldserve any purpose, but I should like totry. I am going to suggest the absenceof a quorum, if I may, without losing myright to the floor, in order that we maydiscuss this subject a little further withsome Senators, in the hope that we mayreach an agreement. But if we cannot, Iwill call off the quorum and will resumemy remarks.I ask unanimous consent that I maybe permitted to suggest the absence of aquorum without losing my i'ight to thefloor.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is thereobjection? Without objection, itis soordered.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I sug-gest the absence of a quorum.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerkwill call the roll.The assistant legislativeclerk pro-ceeded to call the roll.Mr. WILLIAMS ofDelaware.Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent thatthe order foi' the quorum call be re-scinded.The PRESING OFFICER. Withoutobjection, it Is so ordered. SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENTSOF 1970The Senate continued with the con-sideration of the bill(H.R. 17550)to amend the Social Security Act to pro-vide increases in benefits, to Improvecomputation methods, and to raise theearnings base under the old-age, survi-vors, and disability insurance system, tomake improvements in the medicare,medicaid, and maternal and child healthprograms with emphasis upon Improve- December 17, 1970ments in the operating effectiveness ofsuch programs, and for other purposes.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. Pres-ident, without too much hope of gettingit agreed to, I send to the desk a unan-imous-consent request.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pro-posed unanimous-consent request will bestated.The assistant legislative clerk read asfollows:I ask unanimous consent that the com-mittee amendments be considered and agreedto en bloc, and as agreed to be consideredas original text for the purpose of amend-ment.Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I object.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objectionis heard. The unanimous-consent requestis not agreed to.The Senator from Delaware is recog-nized.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. Pres-ident, I regret very much that we areplaced in this position because I thinkit would have been the most orderlyprocedure to have offered the amend-ments as they came before the Senate. Iwas perfectly willing, as I said before,to debate the family assistance planwhen It was before us. Other Senatorscould have gotten recognition as far asI am concerned immediately after I re-lease the floor, which would have beenIn very short order, and whoever is rec-ognized could have been recognized. Itold the Presiding Officer that the Sena-tor from Connecticut wanted to be rec-ognizednext,andhecouldhave presented his family assistance plan andit would have been before the Senatein an orderly manner. In that way itcould have been debated, amended, orwhatever the Senate saw fit to do. I re-spect the right of Senators to proceed asthey see fit. I would take the same posi-tion If I felt as they do. But we are con-fronted with this situation.It Is obvious we are not going to getthis bill enacted until we face the ques-tion of what we do or do nct do withthe trade agreement section. There Isno polb1e parliamentary situation thatcould develop In the Senate where theSenate could vote on final passage of thebill without firsthaving accepted orstricken from the bill the trade agree-ment section, whIch Is title m. There Is no possible way that could be doneso we will have to face this issue first.The reason I would have liked to havethis agreement is that I think It Is mostunfortunate If the roll were called onthe question of raising social securitybenefits by 10 percent and raising theminimum to $100, together with all theother benefits, and have that news goover the country so that the people wouldbelieve they are going to get those in-creases just a few days before Christmas,when every single Member knows it willnot become law under those circum-stances uniess we can settle the tradeIssue In the Senate.Therefore, since this situation hasdeveloped, we should face the Issue. AsI said before, I voted against placing thetrade section In this bill. I would hate tosee the Senate take that step. I know amajority of the committee, and a sub-CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEstantial majority of the committee, votedto put this section in the bill as title3. I respect the decision of the majorityof the committee. The majority of thecommittee by a vote of 14 to 1 rejectedthe family assistance plan on one occa-sion, by a vote of 10 to 6 on another oc-casion, and I forgot the vote on a thirdoccasion but It was by a substantial mar-gin. So we have that situation.I am willing to face all of this but Iam a great believer that if we are goingto have a lot of filibuster let us have itand get it over and either settle the issueor not.Therefore, even though I am opposedto and object to the trade section, I amgoing to submit an amendment to thebill that provides that at the end of thecommittee amendment we insert anamendment which Is the Trade Agree-ment Act, We will settle that Issue rightnow and then proceed with the rest ofthe bill in an orderly fashion, I hope.Therefore, Mr. President, I send to thedesk an amendment to be inserted at theend of the pending committee amend-ment.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment will be stated.The assistant legislative clerk pro-ceeded to read the amendment.Mr. WILLIAMS ofDelaware. Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent thatfurther reading of the amendment bedispensed with. It Is just the title of thebill.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Withoutobjection, it is so ordered; and, withoutobjection, the amendment will be printedin the RECORD.*****S 20455 December 17, 1970 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATE S 20457 *****Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, will theSenator yield for a parliamentary in-quiry?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I yield,with the understanding that I do not losemy right to the floor.Mr. JAVITS. Yes, with the under-standing that the Senator does not losehis right to the floor.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from New York is recognized.Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, as I heardthe amendment read, it did not makeany change in the original committeeamendment\u2014that the wording isthe same as title III of the bill. Therefore, Iask the Chair whether such an amend-ment is in order. I realize something maybe added to it. The Chair has it therefor examination. I did not hear that itmade any change in the original com-mittee amendment.The PRESIDING OFFICER. There isno rule that prevents its being offered.Later, if it appeared to be redundant, amotion could be offered to withdraw itor to strike. The committee amendmentsare not a part of the bill until they areagreed to on the floor.Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, a furtherparliamentary inquiry.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator will state it.Mr. JAVITS. My inquiry is directed towhether a point of order would lie againstthis amendment because it does not ac-tually amend any part of the committeeamendment. The Chair has the amend-ment before him.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is of the opinion that a point oforder would not lie at this time.Mr. JAVITS. Could the Senator fromNew York have the Chair's reason, ac-cording to the Parliamentarian?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. Pres-ident, may I comment? It would not liefor the same reason that a point of orderwould not lie against the family assist-ance plan. I checked into both of them.I think it would have been better if wehad done otherwise, but the Parlia-mentarian very clearly stated that theamendments are in order. The family as-sistance plan would be in order as theSenator from Connecticut was going tooffer it.Mr. President, this amendment is be-ing offered on behalf of the Senator fromGeorgia (Mr. TALMADGE) and the Sena-tor from Arizona (Mr. FANNIN). I am inthis position. I disagree, as I told theSenators, with the trade section in thisbill, but I do think that if we are goingto have to face it before anything isdone, I want it faced head on and I donot want to disillusion a lot of thesepeople. I am reserving the right to voteagainst this amendment.I would be willing to withdraw thisamendment\u2014and the Senator knows Ihave bent over backward toget anagreement. This is not a threat; I amnot offering it in that way\u2014if we couldhave unanimous consent to let this gooveruntiltomorrow, when Senatorscould have time to think this over, andmaybe we could get together. I wouldwithdraw this amendment and would bethe first to renew my request if we couldhavethatunanimous-consent agree-ment. I hope it can be done. I thinkthis would be the better way to proceed.I am caught in the situation. I have nochoice, because the minute I release thefloor I know the family assistance planwill be offered, which is another unre-lated bill, not subject to a point of orderagain, as the Senator points out.If we are going to face this decisionlater let us just face It now.If we can get unanimous consent tolay this bill aside until tomorrow at tha3 o'clock session with the understandingthat I resume my right to the floor sothere will be the same parliamentary sit-uation I shall withdraw that amendmentand express the hope that with Sena-tors who agree to this trade section wewouldreachanagreement onthe amendments.Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, will theSenator yield?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I yield.Mr. JAVITS. I did not ask my questionwith a view to challenging the Senator. Iwanted to get, the parliamentary situa-tion for other amendments which I orother Senators may offer.I might say, as I said earlier, Provi-dence may be leading us by the hand.The trade amendment is the stickingpoint in the bill, and the Senator hasproperly tabbed it, and let us have it out.Let the administration face it and let usface it. Let us try to find our way out ofthis maze. It may be the best thing to do.I ask nothing from the Senator at all.He has offered an amendment.Mr. GRIFFIN. Mr. President, will theSenator from Delaware yield without los-ing the floor?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I yield.Mr. GRIFFIN. The Senator from Del-aware has offered an amendment to thepending committee amendment. I askthis as a parliamentary inquiry. For theinformation of the Senate, is the Sena-tor from Michigan correct that no fur-ther amendment may be offered to thetrade amendment which the Senator nowhas before the Senate?The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is of the opinion that this is anamendment in the second degree and Istherefore not open to further amend-ment.Mr. GRIFFIN. So if we proceed to avote on this amendment, we will have tovote it up or down?The PRESIDING OFFICER. That Iscorrect.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I agreewtth that ruling. That is as I understandit. It is most unfortunate, but that is thesituation.I am only offering this trade amend-ment to point up the situation we wouldbe in with the family assistance plan.The same thing would be true.I hope the Senate will not get intothis posture on either of these bills. Iwant them voted up or down.If the Senator made a motion to strikeout this trade section and it were inorder I would expect to support it. AnySenator can offer such a motion. It maybe amended in a form that both the Sen-ator and I wo.uld be supporting. Perhapswe would not.Mr. SCOT'F. Mr. President, will theSenator yield?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I yield.Mr. SCOTT. I am aware of what thedistinguished Senator has in mind, andI would be hopeful, under the com-plexities of the situation, that he wouldproceed as he is doing. I do not think theleadership on either side is making anysuggestionthat we go overuntIl3 o'clock tomorrow.Mr. MANSFIELD. No. I think we oughtto stay on the pending measure. I amsorry that in my absence\u2014not becauseof my absence\u2014but in my absence therequestofthe distinguished SenatorfromDelaware,whichwouldhave brought about the acceptance of all com-mittee amendments and would have Ineffect presented us with a clean bill, wasnot agreed to. I think that what he sug-gested was proper and was the appropri-ate and efficient way to proceed. Thisway we are getting the cart before thehorse.Frankly, I do not know what positionwe are getting into, but we ought to getaccustomed to being confused. I thinkwe ought to take advantage of whateverhours are 1eft and do what we can to acton the President's program.Mr. SCOTT. My purpose is to get thosemeasures In the President's programwhich can be enacted, If at all possible,written into law. I do not see anythingto be gained by going over until 3 o'clockon this or any other amendment.Mr. CURTIS. Mr. President, will theSenator from Delaware yield for an ob-servation, with the understanding thathe does not lose the floor and that hisspeech will not be counted as a secondspeech?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I yieldwith that understanding.Mr. CURTIS. I would like to point outthat there are many things in this vol-uminous bill. There are many improve-ments in many of our social programs.There are improvements in the medicaidprogram. There are improvements In themedicare program.If we labor for days and perfect thisbill, and then in the end see It all cometo naught because of extended debate S 20458on the trade portion of the bill, then thewhole Senate has wasted its time. It haslabored for nothing. It was held out tothe country that certain acts would betaken and certain things would be cor-rected and \u00e8ertain problems would besolved, but then we would come to theend of the line and there would be no leg-islation because of the filibuster on thetrade bill.So since that is the only one featurewhere it appears there might be a fili-buster, I think the thing to do is to faceup to it now rather than labor here fordays, improving or rejecting or approv-ing family assistance and all the otherprovisions in the bill only to have theentire bill come to naught.Suppose we got a social security, medi-care, and welfare bill that met with theapproval of the majority of the Senate,after long hours and days of work; then,face a filibuster over trade, it is betterthat we face that threat right now. Ithankthedistinguished Senatorfor yielding. I believe that it is the interestsof the time of all the Senators that wefaces this issue of the trade portion ofthis bill.I did not support all of thetrade portion. I am inclined to supportthat which is within or near the purviewof that recommended by the administra-tion.Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, will theSenator yield to me?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Yes.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields without losing his rightto the floor.Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I shouldlike to point out to those who have madecomments that the President of the United States, in a letter to the Senatorfrom Pennsylvania (Mr. SCOTT) datedDecember 10, 1970, stated that he sayshe is strongly against this measure.The President wrote:The well-being of the United States re-quires this trade legislation. I must urge,therefore, that the Senate examine thesematters with great care, in an endeavor toput this legislation into acceptable form. Iwould hope that such legislation could bepassed at this session of Congress.So the President himself, Mr. Presi-dent, has invited very careful considera-tion of the matter. He has flagged itscritical importance, and, as I said a min-ute ago, it may very well be that Provi-dence is leading us by the hand in re-spect to what the exigencies have com-pelled the Senator from Delaware to do.I should like to make, in conclusion,just one further parliamentary inquiry,Mr. President, if I may have the atten-tion of the Presiding Officer and theParliamentarian.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator will state it.Mr. JAVITS. If this amendmen1t, Mr.President, is rejected either by tabling orby rejection on a vote, does that displacein any way title Ifl of this bill, the so-caUed trade title?The PRESIDING OFFICER. It doesnot.Mr. JAVITS. So title III would stillremain to be voted up or down, no matterwhat we did about this amendment?CONGRESSIONAL RECORD SENATEThe PRESIDING OFFICER. That iscorrect.Mr. JAVITS. I thank my colleague.Now may I say to the Senator frorliDelaware that though I think, as I say,that Providence may have led us all bythe hand in the right direction, I shallnevertheless take the occasion, when, as,and if we adjourn tonight, to gather mycolleagues together and, still without anyassurance that it may or may not bedone, give the Senate our best judg-ment as to how we think the Senate andits work may be facilitated and our con-sciences and our principles sustained inrespect to this matter. I thank the Sen-ator very much for his kindness in yield-ing.Mr. CURTIS. Mr. President, a parlia-mentary inquiry.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I yield tothe Senator from Nebraska for a parlia-mentary inquiry.Mr. CURTIS. Under unanimous con-sent that he not lose the floor or any ofhis rights.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Withoutobjection, it is so ordered.Mr. CURTIS. Suppose the amendmentnow offered by the distinguished Senatorfrom Delaware is agreed to by the Sen-ate, and thereafter, when the committeeamendment dealing with trade is pre-sented, it is voted down; does the Wil-liams amendment still remain in thebill?The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. SAX-BE).Itwould remain if thereafter thebillwaspassed,withtheWilliamsamendment, as agreed to, as a part ofthe original bill.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. Pres-ident, I have checked this point, and Iagree with the ruling of the Chair. Itwould be redundant because to a cer-tain extent it would be repetitious, andsince there was nothing in the bill itselfwhen it went to conference, one of thesections could be dropped.Mr. President, as I said, I regret theparliamentary situation in which we findourselves, but I think we should face thisissue. I say again that if, tomorrow whenwe reconvene, this matter has not beendisposed of, and we can get an agree-ment on these amendments en bloc, Ishall be the first to support a withdrawalof this amendment, so that we can pro-ceed in an orderly fashion, because Ithink it would be much better.However, since we cannot, I feel thatwe have no choice here, because I thinkwe had just as well face up to the issue.To make sure that we do, I ask for theyeas and nays on my amendment. Iyield the floor.The yeas and nays were ordered.Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, is this to vote on the pending amendment?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Yes.Mr. MANSFIELD. Will the Senatortryto get a timelimitation,so we can get on with the bill?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. Pres-ident, we do not need a time limitation,because I, too, think we should get onwith the bill. I ask that the clerk callthe roll.Several Senators addressed the Chair,December 17, 1970Mr. JAVITS. I did not hear that. Whatwas the the unanimous-consent request?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I am justtrying to expedite the work of the Sen-ate. I said, \"Let's call the roll.\"Mr. JAVITS, Mr. President, I suggestthe absence of a quorum.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerkwill call the roll.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware, Mr. Pres-ident, I yield the floor.The assistant legislative clerk pro-ceeded to call the roll.Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I ask unan-imous consent that the order for thequorum call be rescinded.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Withoutobjection, it is so ordered, S 20470 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATE SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENTSOF 1970The Senate continued with the con-sideration of the bill(H.R. 17550)to amend the Social Security Act to provideincreases in benefits, to improve compu-tation methods, and to raise the earningsbase under the old age, survivors, anddisability insurance system, to make im-provements in the medicare, medicaid,and maternal and child health pro-grams with emphasis upon improve-ments in the operating effectiveness ofsuch programs, and for other purposes.AMENDMENT NO. 1147Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, on be-halfof myself, Senator YARBOROUGH,Senator SAXBE, Senator MATHIAS, Sena-tor HART, Senator HUGHES, Senator Mc-GOVERN, and Senator MONDALE, I send tothe desk an amendment to the cata-strophic health insurance provisions ofH.R. 17550, and I ask that the amend-ment may be ordered to lie on the tableand be printed.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Theamendment will be received and printed,and will lie on the table.Mr. KENNEDY. The purpose of theamendment is to launch a new Federal\"seed\" program to improve the Nation'sexisting health care system, and to helpprepare the system to meet the extra-ordinary new demands that will be madeupon it by the catastrophic health in-surance program.The measure to provide Federal In-surance against the cost of catastrophicillness is one of the most significant pro-visions added by the Senate FinanceCommittee to the social security bill. Ishare the committee's concern over thecritical problem of catastrophic illness.Indeed, I believe that one of the mostserious aspects of our national healthcrisis for millions of our citizens is thevery real fear of financial ruin becauseof serious illness.At the same time, however, such a pro-gram, if enacted by itself, runs the riskof substantially increasing the existingimbalances in our health system. I believethat if a program of insurance againstcatastrophic illness is to be enacted atthis time, it should also include pro-visions dealing with the equally seriousproblcms of the organization and deliveryof health care in the Nation. In otherwords, I feel that any new major healthinsurance program cannot be simply afinancing mechanism. It cannot be per-mitted simply to increase the effectivedemand for health care, without at thesame time taking the essential stepsthat are necessary to insure that the newdemand can be met, and that high qual-ity health services will actually be avail-able.The amendment I have proposed wouldestablish a \"Health Resources Develop\u2014ment Account\"intheCatastrophicHealth Insurance Trust Fund, to helpsolve the critical problems of manpower,December 17, 1970facilities, and other resources in the Na-tion's health care system.The Health Resources DevelopmentAccount would be financed by earmark-ing 10 percent\u2014approximately $220 to$250 million a year, based on presentestimates\u2014of the funds In the Cata-strophic Health Insurance Trust Fund forthe purposes of the account. The fundsin the account would be used as \"frontend\" money to supplement other Gov-ernmenthealthdevelopmentefforts. They would pay for establishing newgroup practices, for manpower trainingand education, for creating and develop-ing new categories and skills inthe health field,for strengthening healthplanning activities in States and local-ities, and for a wide variety of other in-novative programs.Funds from the account would not re-place the regular appropriations for sup-port of ongoing health services, such asaid to medical schools and hospitals.Rather, the funds will be applied as acatalyst for innovation in all parts of thehealth system. In making this commit-ment, Congress will recognize its respon-sibility to the American people to assurethe availability of health services, notmerely to provide a payment mechanismfor such services.The approach adopted in this amend-ment has been specificolly endorsed bymany experts In the health field, includ-ing the report last June of the adminis-tration's Task Force on Medicaid.In addition, a similar \"resources de-velopment fund\" approach is containedin part F of S. the bill that Sena-tor YARBOROUGH, Senator SAXRE, 14 otherSenators, and I have introduced in thisCongress to establish a program of com-prehensive national health insurance forthe United States.At this time, however, I would like toemphasize as strongly as I can that theamendment we are offering today is inno sense tailored to any particular ver-sion of Federal health insurance. Rather,it offers a program designed to developthe health resources needed to meet thenew demand that will be made on thehealth systems by any extension of ex-isting Federal health insurance programs,whether it be the catastrophic illnessinsurance program in the committee billor any other program.Mr.President,today's WashingtonStar carries a perceptive article by JudithRandall emphasizing the importance ofincluding resources development provi-sions in health insurance legislation.Otherwise, as she states, the reach ofsuch legislation will surely exceed itsgrasp.Mr. President, I hope that this amend-ment will be accepted by Congress as partof the pending legislation. I ask unani-mous consent that the amendment maybe printed at this point in the RECORD,together with the article by Miss Randall.There being no objection, the amend-ment and article were ordered to beprinted in the RECORD, as follows:AMENDMENT No. 1147On page 402, lIne 11, delete the quotationmark.On page 402, Insert after line 11 the fol-lowing: December 17, 1970'HEALTH RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACCOUNT\"SEC. 2011.

Long, D-La., is the same in princi-ple, if not in detail, as a plan the adminis-tration is mulling over. Long's bill has littlechance of passage before the 91st Congressends this month, but it will likely be re-introduced by Long in the 92nd Congress,thus casting the President in a \"me-too\" role.There is, furthermore, a fundamental diffi-culty with both proposals which their Re-publican and Democratic advocates alike willbe hard put to explain after their Initialpolitical popularity begins to wear off: Themeasures provide for federal payment o!medical bills with no thought whatever ofhow to control costs, insure quality care ormeet the additional demand for services theywould create\u2014three matters that alreadyhave evoked the nation's concern.It might seem that this lesson had beenlearned from medicare, but apparently ithas not, for there is nothing in either the$2.5 billion Long bill or anything the adniin-istration has said that would indicate morethan lip-service interest in measures to aug-ment the supply of health manpower or tendto make the health care system more effi-cient.Indeed, to cite just one example, the num-ber of medical students receiving federalloans has dropped by more than 8.000 sincethe President took office, which hardly bodeswell for the easing of the doctor shortage.The irony of all this is that the adminis-tration, after dragging its feet for nearly twoyears in the health care field, has resistedproposals\u2014like that of Sen. Edward M. Ken-nedy, D-Mass.\u2014f or comprehensive nationalhealth insurance, arguing that personnel andfacilities for such a system are lacking.As a matter of fact, the Kennedy proposal,which has bipartisan support, makes provi-sions for the expanded plant, equipment andpersonnel which national health insurancewould require.A \"toolingup\" period of three years beforethe plan went into operation would be de-voted to creating\u2014at a total cost of about$800 million\u2014some 2.000 fully staffed andequipped group medical practices and. otherfacilities to care for 60 million people nowwithout adequate medical attention.After the preparatory period, a portionof the system's revenue would be set asideeach year to enable the nation to keep pacewith the inevitable growth of its case load.Nothing in either Long's bill or anything theadministration is considering is anywherenear so thoroughly thought out from theviewpoint of either resources or costs.The administration.has opposed the meas-ure on the ground, among others, that it isnot in the American tradition: It would seem,however, that what Kennedy proposes couldeasily be justified as \"research and develop-ment\" which,if the space program andatomic energy are any Indications, are asAmerican as apple pie.Even if Congress chooses to ignore the restof the Kennedy proposal and enacts a cata-strophic-illness measure that provides a sub-sidy only for large medical bills, It shouldcertainly contain something very like the\"toolingup period.\" Without it, the reachof any health care legislation, present or f u-ture, will almost surely exceed its grasp.Meanwhile, the President is going to haveto acknowledge, to himself at least, that hehas an enormous credibility gap to closewhen he seeks to play the statesman in thehealth care field.S 20471Mr. SAXBE, Mr. President, will I yield to the Senatorfrom Ohio.Mr. SAXBE. I am glad to be associatedon this amendment with the Senatorfrom Massachusetts, for the reason thatI feel that if we go into an extensiveinsurance program, however well-inten-tioned, we will simply add to the alreadydifficult situation of expenses that can-not be avoided today with high-pricedhospital beds, and not trying to keeppeople out of the hospital by preventivemedicine, by having preventive facilities,and by having trained personnel who canbe available to persons who otherwisewould wind up in the hospital.I feel very strongly that our healthdistributio: method In this country atthe present time is sadly in need of re-view, and that to dump good money afterbad on this catastrophic system, with-out putting money into the training ofpersonnel and the providing of preven-tive facilities, will not solve any prob-lem; it will simply raise the cost and in-crease the crowding and the load uponour physicians.Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, may wehave order?The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ate will be in order.Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thankthe distinguished Senator from Ohio. To-gether with Senator YARBOROUGH, he wasone of the initial sponsors of our nationalhealth insurance program. He realizesthat to obtain quality health care, whatreally to do is to improve the organiza-tion and delivery of health care, as wellas the financing. If we are going to pro-vide quality health care, we must ap-proach the problem in this multifacetedmanner.I commend the amendment that wasoffered in the Finance Committee withrespect to catastrophic illness insurance,because it does meet one of the extremelycritical needs of our health system. Manycitizenr who have built up savings overthe course of their lives are threatenedwith the loss of their entlre'savings be-cause of catastrophic illness, We mustbegin now to attack this problem, but wemust also begin to come to grips withthe problem of the shortage of healthmanpower in this country and all theother inadequacies of our health de-livery system,The whole thrust and purpose of thisamendment is to take a small but im-portant step forward to try to alleviatethat shortage. I think It is a responsibleapproach, I think it Is extremely reason-able in terms of resources. It will nottake additional commitments of resour-ces. It will utilize the existing resourcesthat will be raised under the amend-ment of the Finance Committee withrespect to catastrophic Illness.It Is not an amendment that will re-quire additional funding for this pro-gram. That should be understood at thistime. But it Is something that will helpprovide additional manpower and otherhealth resources. As a result, hopefully,we will begin to reduce the inflationarytrend that has been rampant in the en- S 20472 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEDecember 17, 1970tire health service area In recent years.Inflation in the health area is between 2and 3 times as much as it Is generally inour economy. I think that one of theprincipal reasons for this excessive in-flation is that in programs like medicareand medicaid, the Federal Governmenthas increased the demand for healthcare, without providing any means toincrease the supply of health services. Itis for this reason that the Senator fromOhio and I and other Senators haveoffered this amendment.***** S 20618 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014SENATE December to CalendarNo. 17550, under agree-ment.The PRESIDrNG OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have notinformed the Senator from Delawarewhat .1 am about to say, but I had in-formed the Senator from Georgia and Ihad mentioned the matter to the Sen-ator from Rhode Island; namely, that Iintend to move to table the pendingamendment to the committee amend-ment when the bill Is laid before theSenate.Having made that explanation, Mr.President, I now move that the pendingamendment\u2014Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, will theSenator from Louisiana yield?'Mr. LONG. I yield only for a question.Mr. JAVITS. I ask theSenator thisquestion. In view of the fact that Mem-bers have not been notified, and I knowof at least one Member who is on hisway here, having heard the rumor. Doesnot the Senator feel some little time, say,30 mifiutes, or a small amount of time,should be granted Members who arewithin reach but cannot get here\u2014Mr. LONG. I would be willing,if I could obtain unanimous consent to do so,without prejudice to myself or losing myright to the floor, to suggest the absenceof a quorum in order that\u2014Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. Pres-ident, we have debated this long enough.Let us face the issue. I would regret If itwere tabled. As I said earlier, I did notsupport putting this provision in, butthe Senate should stand up and vote onthis trade proposal and I would hope theywould not table it now. We could callthe roll immediately and vote on it now.On a direct vote I will vote againstthe measure.Mr. MONDALE. Mr. President, will theSenator yield?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Afterthat, they can offer the family assistanceplan which Iobjectto,as Senatorsknow, and we can go to a rollcall onthat in a short time.

I wouldbe willing to call the roll right now tosave time.Mr. MONDALE. Mr. President, willthe Senator from Delaware yield?Mr. LONG. If Senators want to havesome additional time, that is all right,but the motion is going to be made, andI will ask it in a moment.I ask unanimous consent that I mightsuggest the absence of a quorum with-out prejudicing the rights of the Sena-tor from Louisiana to the floor, I do notwant to lose the floor as it might denyme my right to make my motion.Mr. PASTORE. Mr. President, reserv-ing the right to object\u2014Mr. MONDALE. Mr. President, will theSenator yield for a question?The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. FAN-WIN). The Senator from Louisiana couldmake his motion to table and still callfor a quorum.Mr. MONDALE. Mr. President\u2014Mr. LONG. Does the Senator wish meto yield to him for a question or a state-ment?Mr. MONDALE. I would like to askthe Senator a question prior to makingthe motion.Mr. LONG. I yield for a question.Mr. MONDALE. My question Is this:The Senator is aware, I assume, that theamendment which he seeks to table wasonly offered yesterday afternoon, andthat at this point those who oppose thelegislation have not had 1 minute to dis-cuss the merits of this revolutionarychange in trade legislation. Does not theSenator from Louisiana think, in lightof the fact that one side of this majorissue has not been heard, that it mightmake the making of this motion some-what premature?Mr. LONG. What the Senator says, ofcourse, has great logic. When I first cameto the Senate, I liked to think, on mat-ters of this sort, that an eloquent speechcould change the vote. But this measurehas been voted on a number of times, soI do not believe the most eloquent speechever made in the history of this bodywould change a single vote. Thus, thisSenator feels that this matter should bevoted on, and if we could have unani-mous consent to vote at some particularmoment, I would be willing to considera unanimous-consent request, but wecannot even get consent to accept thecommittee amendments en bloc, which iscustomary. So we must proceed the bestway we can.Mr. PASTORE. Mr. President, will theSenator from Louisiana yield?Mr. LONG. I yield for a question.Mr. PASTORE. Would the Senatorfrom Louisiana consider a half hour onagreed time, to take a vote at the termi-nation of the half hour on the merits ofthis particular amendment as suggestedby the Senator from Delaware? We couldhave a unanimous-consent agreement forone-half hour, with 15 minutes to a side,to discuss this matter just as a recapitu-lation, because it has been talked todeath, and then we would have a vote onthe merits. What is wrong with that?Mr. LONG. Well, Mr. President, if I\u2014Mr. PASTORE. Then the Americanpeople would know\u2014if I may concludemy question please\u2014exactly how theSenate feels about the textile Industry.Mr. LONG.

Mr. President, I ask unani-nious consent that there be 1 hour, to beequally divided between the proponentsof the Williams amendment and the op-ponents of the Williams amendment, thetime to be controlled by the Senator fromGeorgia or the Senator from Delaware Ifhe desires\u2014Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. The Sen-ator from Georgia can do that.Mr. LONG. In favor of the amendment,and the time In opposition to be control-ed by the Senator from New York; andat the conclusion of that 1 hour we willvote on the amendment.Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, I will sup-port the motion to table the amendmentof the senior Senator from Delaware be-cause I believe it discriminates againstother American industries facing similareconomic hardships as a result of importpolicies and increased competition fromabroad.The textile and shoe industries arebeing seriously hurt by imports, andwhile I am in sympathy with the amend-ment offered by the Senator from Dela-ware, we must remember there are otherAmerican industries and American work-ing men and women suffering financialhardships. I, therefore, believe we shouldact on their behalf also.I urge the rejection of the amendmentand the adoption of such trade legisla-tion as will fairly protect all industrieswhich are being injured by foreign com-petition.Mr. LONG.

Mr. President, thedistinguished minority leader and I havehad several meetings over the last fewdays discussing the situation in whichthe Senate finds itself in the decliningdays of this Congress.We are disturbed at the image whichthis body is showing to the Americanpeople, but we are more disturbed at theimage we are showing to ourselves. Weare facing a most difficult period in thehistory of the Senate and the Nation\u2014.and the two are synonymous\u2014and wethink that it is vital that we have a meet-ing to discuss this impasse, and it is theintention of the distinguished minorityleader and me to ask for an executivemeeting of the Senate at the conclusionof the vote on cloture tomorrow.Mr. SCOTT. Which would take placeat 11 o'clock, on the assumption that weare convening at 10 a.m. tomorrow, isthat correct?Mr. MANSFIELD. We are conveningat 9. The first hour is set aside. Then thevote is to take place at 11 am. with thehour commencing at 10 am, under con-trolled time.The purpose is that the leadershipwants to lay the problem before the Sen-ate and seek its advice as to what theSenate wants done to get out of the Im-passe in which we find ourselves. Wewill have a list of filibusters now in be-ing and of filibusters proposed, and wewill try to lay out to our colleagues justwhat the consequences will be If we donot get together and do what has to bedonecollectively.Alone,theleaders have no power\u2014only that grace whichSenators give them.We want your advice and counsel. Weare not disturbed about the image out-side, but we are very disturbed aboutthe image of the Senate to the Senateitself; and we would hope, on the basisof your considering this matter tonight,that when the meeting is called tomor-row, we will be able to get together andwork ourselves, in some fashion, out ofthe impasse in which this body\u2014and thisbody alone\u2014finds itself at the presenttime. I think that the Senate owes thecountry no less.Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, would thedistinguished majority leader permit meto make an observation? I simply wantto say that I agree.

Does not the majorityleader think it would be more expeditiousthat we hold such an executive meetingtonight, before the cloture vote is taken?I am afraid the cloture vote is going tostiffen a situation that is already toostiff: If we could have it before that clo-ture vote, maybe we could resolve somedifferences.Mr. MANSFIELD.

December 18, 1970 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATE S 20623Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, I wouldlike to ask the Senator from Connecti-cut whether he would consider makinga unanimous-consent request that hispending amendment be open to amend-ments, and preferably with a time lim-itation.Mr. RIBICOFF. Mr. President, let meexplain to the Senator from Iowa whythis cannot be done.As the Senatorrealizes,yesterday when the Senator from Delaware madehis unanimous-consent request, I wasquick\"to accede to it, after discussionswith the Senator from Delaware. I wasmost anxious to give every Member ofthis body an opportunity to file amend-ments and vote on the amendments tothe family assistance program.The unanimous-consent request to theSenator from Delaware was objected to.Then we found ourselves with the tradeamendment. Now, If I make this unani-mous-consent request, the family assist-ance program would then be open toany other kind of amendment, so wewould be back in the same impasse wherewe were before.I was reluctant to be in a position tooffer family assistance on a take it-or-leave-it basis, but the attitude of manyMembers of this body was such thatwe had no alternative. I have had fre-quent discussions with my cosponsor, theSenator from Utah (Mr. BENNETT); andI have had frequent discussions withthe leadership, and with the Senatorfrom Delaware and the Senator fromOklahoma (Mr. HARRIS); and we thoughtwe had worked out a procedure, keepingin mind the Interests of the Senator fromIowa and the Senator from Oklahoma(Mr. HARRIS); but unfortunately whatwe tried to do we were frustrated in, andwe now find that under the parliamen-tary procedures and the rules, we haveno alternative but to follow the proce-dure that we have followed, in order totry to bring the family assistance pro-gram to a vote, and that is why I regretthat i am unable to accede to the Sena-tor's request at this time.Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, may Iask unanimous consent that I may aska further question?The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coox). The Senator's question has beenasked and answered, and the clerk willproceed with the reading of the amend-ment.Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, a pointof order.

SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENTSOF 1970The Senate continued with the consid-eration of the bill (H.R. 17550) to amendthe Social Security Act to provide in-creases in benefits, to Improve computa-tion methods, and to raise the earningsbase under the old-age, survivors, anddisability insurance system, to make liii-provements in the medicare, medicaid,and maternal and child health programswith emphasis upon improvements in theoperating effectiveness of such programs,and for other purposes.Mr. RIBICOFF. Mr. President, I sendto the desk a modification of my amend-ment.The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. HUGHES). The Senator has a right tomodify his amendment.The modification is as follows:On page 101, line 2, strike out the periodand insert in lieu thereof \"; and\"and be- tween lines 2 and 3 insert the followingparagraph\"(3) with respect to aid furnished underthe plan for any month\u2014\"(A) the total of the amounts used todetermine the needs of an applicant for orrecipient of aid shall be at least $10 higherthan the total thereof which would havebeen used to determine his needs under theState plan as in effect for March 1971, or(B) In the case of two or more such indi-viduals who are, as determined In accordancewith regulatons of the Secretary, membersof the same household, the sum of such to-tals used for the month for which the deter-mination is being made shall exceed the sumof such totals for March 1971 by $10 plus $5for such individual in excess of one,except that, in the case of any State the planof which provides for meeting less than 100per centum of its standard of need or pro-vides for considering less than 100 per cen-turn of requirements in determining need,such plan shall provide such methods as theSecretary may by regulation prescribe forachieving as nearly as possible the resultsprovided fcr under the preceding provisionsof this paragraph.For purposes of paragraph (3). the 'Stateplan as in effect for March 1971' means theState plan (approved under this title) as ineffect for March 1971 or, if there was no suchplanineffectfor such Statefor such month\u2014(I) the State plan which was in effect forsuch month and was approved under title I,in the case of any individual who is sixty-five years of age or older,\"(Ii)the State plan in effect for suchmonth and approved under title X, in thecase of an individual who is blind, or\"(iii)the State plan in effect for suchmonth and approved under title XIV, in thecase of an individual who is severely dis-abled,except that if two or more of clauses (i),(ii). and (iii) are applicable with respect toan individual, it shall be the State plan un-der which the total is the higher (or high-est), and except that if none of such clausesis applicable to an individual, it shall be theone of the State plans approved under titlesI, X, and XIV which were in effect for suchmonth, under which the total which wouldhave been applicable to him is the higher (orhighest)Mr. RIBICOFF. Mr. President, welfarereform is the most urgent domestic leg-islation\u2014Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr.President, will the Senator yield?Mr. RIBICOFF. For a question?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. yeas and nays on the modifica-tion.Mr. RIBICOFF. I will not yield tohave the yeas and nays on the modifica-tion ordered, because it was discussed S 20630 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEDecember 18, 1970here during the meeting that there maybe other Senators here\u2014Mr. WILLIAMSofDelaware. If not onthat amendment can we get the yeas andnays on the amendment of the Senatorfrom Pennsylvania?Mr. RIBICOFF. No; I would object tothat. I have the floor.Several Senators addressed the Chair.Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, regularorder.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ate will be In order.Mr. RIBICOFF. Mr. President, welfarereform is the most urgent domestic legis-lation now before Congress.Men of all persuasions agree that ourwelfare programs have become a na-tionaltragedy.Uncontrollablecosts, weak or nonexistent Incentives to workand maintain the family structure, andcategories which exclude up to one halfof our poor, all contribute to the dis-astrous system now in operation.The hour is late and it is imperativethat the Senate consider this proposal onits merits before adjournment. We willfail our public trust if we allow the pres-ent system to be perpetuated any longer.Therefore, Senator BENNETT and I to-day are proposing an amendment to theexisting welfare system. Our proposal in-cludes the major provisions of the ad-ministration's family assistance plan,first proposed 16 months ago and undercareful consideration by Congress for al-most a year.Many believe this legislation goes toofar; others argue that it does not go farenough. In my own mind, this amend-ment does not contain everything I be-lieve Is ultimately required In our wel-fare program. But, If this is not a per-fect program, It Is a necessary program.Passage of the amendment SenatorBENNETT and I propose would be the mostimportant step in three decades towarddeveloping a more workable, more effi-cient, and more humane public assist-ance system in the United States.Under this proposal, fourteen and ahalf million Americans will be eligiblefor more assistance than under presentlaw. Two million people will be helped outof poverty. For the first time, every fam-ily with a child will be assured a mini-mum income. Uniform national stand-ards and eligibility criteria will simplifyadministration and equalize opportunitythroughout the country.Let us be clear about the nature ofthis amendment. It will not reduce Fed-eral costs or the number of eligible re-cipients. Family assistance will cost anadditional $4.3 billion in the first yearof operation. These costs include $600million for increased day care centersand work training programs, as well asalmost $1 billion for the aged, blind, anddisabled,The needs of the poor, the disabled, theblind, and the elderly will not permit usto do less. This country must realize thatwe cannot save money by wasting lives.THEPRESENTWELFARESYSTEMWelf are In the United States today Is afailure.Assistance payments are insufficient tomeet minimal needs. Family and workincentives are lacking. Eligibility Is basedon arbitrary categories rather than need.While Congress has established a legalright to assistance, it has provided a sys-tem which frustrates the exercise of theserights and demeans those who do exer-cise them.Under present law, fully half of allpoor people, including two out of everythree poor children, do not receive anyaid.The aid to families with dependentchildren program\u2014the largest assistanceprogram\u2014is in reality 54 different pro-gramsin54differentjurisdictionsthroughout the United States.No national standards exist for eitherbenefits or eligibility. Payments varyfrom an average of $46 per month for afamily of four in Mississippi to $265 forsuch a family in New Jersey. This dispar-ity is further aggravated by complicatedState variations in criteria for eligibilityand methods of administration. EachState has developed its own prescriptionfor need standards, assets tests, incapac-ity tests, and requirements for school at-tendance and the age of children who canreceive benefits. In addition, the admin-istration of the program has varied wide-ly from State to State and locality to lo-cality in terms of equity and responsive-ness to the needs of recipients.Mr. GRIFFIN. Mr. President, will thedistinguished Senator from Connecticutyield at an appropriate time?Mr. RIBICOFF. I am pleased to yieldnow to the Senator from Michigan, with-out relinquishing my right to the floor.Mr. GRIFFIN. I wonder if there is apossibility of getting the yeas and nayson the Senator's amendment, when hehas modified it to the extent that he de-sires, because if that is possible, then wecan tell a lot of Senators they can gohome. Otherwise, I have been served withnotice that there may be a live quorumlater in the evening, and I do not knowwhether to warn Senators or not.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. Pres-ident, if the Senator will yield-.-\u2014--Mr. RIBICOFF. Mr. President, I havethe floor. I will answer the question ofthe assistant minority leader, and thenI shall be pleased to yield to the distin-guished Senator from Delaware.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I wouldlike to have the yeas and nays ordered onboth the Scott amendment and the Ribi-coff amendment. Then Senators willknow that this matter cannot go throughon a voice vote but that there will be aroilcall vote.The Senator has a chance to modifyhis amendment, and I did not object tothat. He has another modification at thedesk, and I have no objection to that.But since he has modified it I would liketo ask for the yeas and nays on the twoamendments tonight.The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. HuGHES). The Chair will Instruct theSenator that he cannot request the yeasand nays on the Scott amendment with-out unanimous consent.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I ask forthe yeas and nays on the pending amend-ment.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does theSenator from Connecticut yield to theSenator from Delaware so that he mayrequest unanimous consent that It be inorder to ask for the yeas and nays on theScott amendment?Mr. RIBICOFF. I personally have noobjection. I just want to make my posi-tion clear while the majority leader ishere. I personally am satisfied with theRibicoff -Bennettamendmentasit stands. The majority and minority lead-ers asked us to try to work out as manyas possible of the controversies. One ofthe controversies, of course, is that thereare certain Senators who would like toamend theRibicoff-Bennett amend-ment, and under the parliamentary sit-uation this cannot be done. I happen tothink it is a good, acceptable amend-ment as it is, and the only reason that Iobjected to it was out of considerationfor other Senators.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. Pres-ident, will the Senator yield? I appreci-ate the Senator's position, but under theposition that we are put in from a parlia-mentary standpoint and under the rulesof the Senate it is not subject to anamendment.That could mean that 99 Members ofthe Senate agreeing on an amendmentcould not get the amendment adoptedunless the Senator from Connecticut ap-proved. He is the only man out of the100 who would have the right to amendthis pending amendment. He could listento the debate and amend it to his ownsatisfaction, but not the satisfaction ofall others.Mr. President, I do not wish to proceedwith that power in the hands of any oneSenator or in any one place. I tried hardto get this situation to where we couldhave the right to amend; but havingfailed I just want us to vote it up ordown, and then we can offer amend-ments. Therefore, I would ask the Sen-ator's permission to ask for the yeas andnays.Mr. 000DELL. Mr. President, I ob-ject.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Connecticut has the floor. TheSenate will be in order. Objection isheard to the request of the Senator fiomDelaware, and the Senator from Con-necticut has the floor.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. it doesnot require unanimous consent, Mr.President.Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, willthe Senator from New York withhold hisobjection briefly?Mr. GOODELL. I withhold my objec-tion.Several Senators addressed the Chair.Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, will theSenator from Connecticut yield withoutyielding his right to the floor, so that Imay explain my position?Mr. RIBICOFF. Yes.Mr. SCOTT. My position is that I haveno objection, personally, to the yeas andnays on the Scott amendment, because,having introduced It In the form it Is, Ihave not been advised of the desire tomodify It. Some Senators may be for itand some against it, but no one has askedto modify it, and under those circum-stances, if it will expedite the proceed-ings, I have no objection to the yeas andnays. December 18, 1970 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATE S 20631Mr. SAXBE. Mr. President, I object tothe Senator yielding for that purpose.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objectionis heard.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. That re-quest wiU be made later tonight.Mr. RIBICOFF. The administrativeinefficiencies and redtape associated withwelfare programs are notorious. Individ-ual States and localities must developbudgets of need with required close in-vestigation of the economic status ofeach family. However, these standardsare often unrelated to actual State pay-ments and complicated formula, usingratable reductions and maximum pay-ments, are necessary to calculate thefinal benefits payable to each eligiblefamily. Tiny, but complex adjustmentsare made to reflect changes in the com-position of the family, the ages of itsmembers, its changing economic status,or as special amergencies occur. The re-sulting paperwork overwhelms the ad-ministrative structure. The organiza-tion is fraught with error and is largelyIncomprehensible to recipients and thepublic alike.The major defect of AFDC however,which makes it impossible to reform bysimply adding national standards orgreater administrative efficiencies, Is itscategoricalrestrictionofeligibility.AFDC does not provide assistance tothose families headed by a full-timeworking man.The assumption on which AFDC rests\u2014that the Income of full-time workers Isby definition adequate\u2014is simply notvalid for large numbers of families. In1968, 39 percent of the poor families withchildren in this country were headed byfull-time workers. Their poverty is sel-dom the result of a defect of characteror a failure to try. It Is rather the resultof the inescapable fact that large num-bers of jobs, for a variety of economicreasons, just do not pay an adequatewage\u2014especially for persons with largefamilies.As a result of this Inadequate and in-efficient system, welfare has become acostly shambles. Costs and caseloads un-der AFDC increased by almost 30 percentfrom June 1969 to June 1970.The lack of Incentives to work andmaintainthefamilystructurehave meant that the number of children infamilies with female heads only underAFDC have more than doubled in 10years.The facts are very clear. Welfare inthe United States has already become anational disgrace.THE FINANCE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTSIt Is regrettable that In the face ofsuch chaos a majority of the FinanceCommittee has chosen not to come togrips with meaningful welfare reformlegislation.I share the view of the committee thatfar reaching and Innovative social leg-islation should be tested thoroughly be-fore implementation on a nationwidebasis.But, testing alone in a time of urgentneed Is not enough.In August, 1969, the President out-lined reform legislation which, while notperfect, would take several significantand constructive steps toward a strongwelfare system.The House of Representatives passedlegislation embodying the basic princi-pies of the President's proposal\u2014thefamily assistance plan.After many weeks of hearings, how-ever,the Senate Finance Committeeregrettably refused to consider this planIn detail and substituted an amendmentcalling merely for 2 years of tests.Clearly, passage of a 2-year test pro-gram requiring more legislation at theend of that test period means no welfarereform until 1974 or beyond. Reform Ismuch more urgent than that.The proposal Senator BENNETT and Iintend to make provides for extensivetesting in the period between enactmentand the effective date of welfare reform.The most innovative proposal, to assistthe working poor, would be tested inseveral areas for more than a year.Extensive pretesting of this naturewould provide more than adequate timeto iron out the problems in organizationand administration of family assistance.Furthermore, information gained fromcareful evaluation of existing workingpoor programs In six States would bereadily available.THR PRINCIPLES OP REFORMWelfare Is not a subject of interestonly to the poor and the welfare worker.The measure of a whole society is takenfrom the adequacy, equity, and efficiencyof its programs for the needy. Theirprogress Is our progress.The principles of adequate welfare aresimple and paramount:First, assurance to all members ofsociety of an Income adequate to meettheir basic needs;Second, incentives and opportunity forthe employment of all citizens;Third, encouragement nd supportof the basic family structure;Fourth, a uniform system of nationalstandards supported and financed by theFederal Government; andFifth, simple and efficient administra-tion dedicated to assisting rather thandemeaning the poor.We are a wealth people. As the per-quisites of citizenship have Increased,so too have our responsibilities to oursociety and our fellow man. As a na-tion, we can no longer tolerate a systemof public assistance which fails to meetthe most basic principles of humanity.THE FAMILY ASSISTANCE PLANThe basic principles of family assist-ance are designed to meet the problemsnow plaguing welfare. By assuring aminimum payment to all families Inneed, it Is designed to provide uniformnational standards and simplified ad-ministration.Most impotrant, the program extendseligibility to those families who havebeen arbitrarily and unwisely excludedfrom assistance.Family assistance will replace the 54different State and territorial AIDCprograms with a single program for fam-ilies. It would also substitute a singleIntegrated adult welfare system for themore than 150 different programs ofaid to the aged, tl blind and the dis-abled.Americans are becoming more mobile.Poverty and welfare are national prob-lems requiring national solutions. Fore-most in any such national solution mustbe an effort to assure that citizens wholive in differeint States do not receivegrossly different treatemnt at the handsof their governments. Family assistanceestablishes support levels: $1,-600 per year\u2014plus about $860 in foodstamps\u2014for a family of four, for citizensin all States.Family assistance insures the provi-sion of a minimum benefit by full Federalfinancing of that portion of the pay-ment. In addition, the States, assistedby 30-percent Federal matching up tothe poverty line, can then assure moreadequate total benefits by supplement-ing the minimum payment.Nationwide unifor\u00f1i eligibility rules will make possible another vital reform:simplification and streamlining of thenotorious welfare paperwork and admin-istrative morass. Family assistance ter-minates the present practice of basingbenefits on minute investigations andcomputations of family budgets. Eligi-bility for aid would be determined on asimplified basis, which would includecross-checks of earnings data and asampling of recipients' reports as protec-tion for the system.INCLUSION OF THE WORKING POORThe most important advance proposedby this amendment is the extension ofpublic assistance eligibility to the work-ing poor. This innovative step Is sup-ported by several powerful arguments.First, coverage of the working pooreliminates one of the major inequities inpresent laws. If we are to require recipi-ents to work, we cannot then make themworse off financially than if they did notwork.Second, aid to the working poor pro-motes a consistent set of work incentivesfor the entire program. Recipients willalways be better off by working more.Third, coverage of the working poor isan effective means of combating poverty.Four out of ten poor Americans live infamilies headed by a full-time worker.Family assistance will move 2 millionAmericans over the poverty line.WORK REQUIREMENT AND INCENTIVESTheRibicoff-Bennettamendmenttakes a major step to increase work in-centives for welfare recipients. To makethese incentives increasingly effective there Isincluded a major manpowertraining and child care program withover $600 million in additional funding;$150 million is required to be spent on astrongprogramofpublicservice employment.Recipients under family assistance willbe required to register for and accept jobsor work training in order to receive FAPbenefits. Benefit levels will be decreasedby $500 per famly for a failure to register.THE REVISED FAMILY ASSISTANCE PLAN -Thelatest administration revision offamily assistance was submitted In Octo-ber to the Senate Finance Committee,While this was a strong program\u2014therewere a number of changes which I feltwere necessary to improve the legislationbefore it was presented to the full Senate.I made these suggestions both In a formal S 20632letterto the Secretary of Health, Edu-cation, and Welfare and In informal con-versations. Most of these improvementsare contained in the Ribicoff-Bennettamendment.* NATIONAL GOALToday,one in every eight Americansis poor. In the wealthiest nation in his-tory, our poor outnumber the total popu-lation of Canada. More than a third ofour poor are children. Many of the restare ill, disabled or elderly.These people are tragic evidence of ourneglect, and lack of commitment to endpoverty.Our growing national affluence has notbeen fully shared. In a future whichpromises greater riches, for many, butcontinued poverty for some, we have, Inthe words of the President's Commissionon Income Maintenance Programs, \"thepotential for social division unparalleledIn our country.\"Our failure has been a failure of com-mitment rather than resources. We havethe means to end poverty. Let us resolveto do so.As a beginning step, Congress must es-tablish a national goal to end poverty Inthis decade.UNEMPLOYED PARENT PROGRAMAspassed by the House of Representa-tives, HR. 18311 provided for mandatoryStatesupplementation\u2014withFederal sharing\u2014of families headed by an un-employedfather\u2014AFDC\u2014TJP.Under present law, this Is an optional programwhich exists In 23 States.In the administration revisions of HR.16311. thIs mandatory AFDC-UP hasbeen deleted.I strongly support inclusion of thisprogram\u2014as provided by the House ofRepresentatives and the original admin-istration proposal. Restoration of thisprovision would benefit some 90,000 fam-ilies, or more than 300,000 poor people.RESTORATION OF THE REQUIREMENTS INSEC\"nON 452 OF HR. 16311 FOR USING \"STAND-ARD OF NEED\" FOR FAMILIES WITH INCOMEIn August 1969, the President, in hiswelfare address to the Nation, stronglysupported the principle that no recipientwould be worse off under his proposalthan under existing law. Unfortunately,a subsequent revision of HR. 16311would adversely affect families with out-side income In 22 States by reducingState supplements. Restoration of thestandard-of-need provision in section452 will remedy this unwise provision.MINIMUM WAGE LEVELS FOR WELFARERECIPIENTS TAKING EMPLOYMENTA universally recognized objective ofwelfare reform, clearly stated In thePresident's welfare message, is the greatneed to move the poor from relief rollsto payrolls. Legisation toward this laud-able goal, however, must not sacrificevery basic objections to providing aready-made pool of forced labor for em-ployers paying substandard wages.Substandard wages perpetuate poverty.At $1 an hour, a fully employed husbandand father of two children falls almost$2,000 below the barest minimum incomerequired for his family.Therefore, I propose that provisions beadded to this reform legislation stipulat-lug that welfare recipients required toaccept work be paid a reasonable wage,preferably the basic minimum wage of$1.60 an hour. The Rlblcoff-Bennett pro-posal takes a bajor step in this directionby guaranteeing wages of at least $1.20an hour.ADEQUATE SAFEGUARDS FOR STATE AND LOCALEMPLOYEESASSIMILATEDUNDERFEDERALPROGRAMSThere must be assurances that Stateand local welfare employees, who wouldbe encompassed by the new Federal pro-gram, are treated fairly with respect totheir seniority, salary, and pension rightsearned under their previous employers.FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION OP FULLY FEDERALLTFINANCED WELFARE PROGRAMSWelfare reform must reduce the majorinequities and complexities that resultfrom over 50 different welfare systemswith their varied forms, requirements,and regulations. In many States today,the system is operated by three separatelevels of government: Federal, State,and local. The redtape, inequities, andsheer complexities of these arrange-ments must be reduced.Therefore, I propose that reform leg-islation include a provision for manda-tory Federal administration of all welfareprograms which are 100 percent fundedby Federal money. This provision will bea major step toward our goal of univer-sally applied standards for all recipients.PUBLIC SEEVICE EMPLOYMENTThe major goal of any public assist-ance program should be the provision ofadequate employment opportunities per-mitting recipients to supplement andeventually replace welfare payments byearned wages.Regrettably, the original family assist-p.nce plan presented to Congress con-tained not a single job opportunity.Senator HARRIS and I have suggestedan amendment establishing a strongprogram of public service employment.Such an amendment would complementthe training provisions already suggestedabove by assuring a. greater number ofjobs at the end of tl3e training cycle.Therefore, I propose a public serviceemployment program for recipients ofFAP benefits or State supplementation.Under the amendment, the Secretaryof Labor would enter into grants or con-tracts with public or private nonprofitagencies to create jobs in a wide varietyof enumerated fields of benefit to thepublic.Special provisions were designed to as-sure that such jobs are not dead-endjobs and that they offer opportunitiesfor career advancement. The Secretaryof Labor Is required to review each em-ployment record at least once every 8months.The jobs provided must meet stand-ards with regard to health, safety, andworking conditions, not jeopardize ex-isting employment, and otherwise con-form to certain protections. Wages paidmust at least equal the Federal mini-mum wage or, if higher, any applicableState or local minimum wage or the pre-vailing wage for such jobs In the samelabor market area.In order to encourage movement byparticipating individuals Into regularDecember 18, 1970jobs and to insure that these jobs in-volve the performance of useful work,provision Is made for declining Federalmatching overtime.NInety percentmatching Is provided for the first 24months during which such employmentis provided, and 80 percent thereafter.The Secretary of Labor is obligated toexpend at least $150 million annually onsuch public service jobs. The funds maycome from appropriations pursuant topart C of title IV of the Social SecurityAct or from any other funds available tothe Secretary of the Department of La-bor under other acts.WORK REQUIREMENTS FOR MOTHERS OF SCHOOL-AGE CHILDRENIn 1967, the Senate recognized the in-herent social difficulties of forcing moth-ers of school-age children to accept em-ployment. At that time,the Senatepassed an amendment which exemptedmothers of school-age children from re-quired employment during the hourschildren are home from schooLThe most cursory examination of his-toryshows that the victims of legisla-tion forcing mothers to work are thechildren of those mothers. Our own na-tional traditions are based on the beliefthat the best interests of the child arebest protected by its mother. The deci-sion whether to accept employment whilethe child remains at home should be leftsolely with the mother.Whilenotexemptingmothersof school-age children from work, the pro-posal of Senator BENNETT and myselfwill guarantee that mothers of thesechildren will only be ,,requlred to workIf adequate child care facilities are avail-able. In actual fact, the work priori-ties practically assure that these mothersof school-age children will not be af-fected by work requirements.ADDITIONAL SAFEGUARDS FOR THE LEGAL RIGHTSOP WELFARE RECIPIENTSThe administration's family assistancelegislation provided for a marked andregressive change affecting the legalrights of welfare recipients by requiringthat stepfathers assume legal responsi-bility for their stepchildren. Most Statesdo not impose an obligation of supporton a stepfather, Generally, our federalsystem has left matters of domestic rela-tions laws to the wisdom of the States.Thus, the effect of the original FAP pro-vision was to impose a discriminatoryobligiation of the stepfathers or poorfamilies.STATE SAVINGS AND ADULT CATEGORIESIn addition to these provisions, twoother provisions of the amendment areof utmost importance.ADULT CATEGORIESSenator BENNETT and I propose toassure minimum payments to the aged,blind and disabled of $130 a month foran lndlvldtial and $230 a month for acouple. This provision will increase pay-ments to approximately 1.5 million re-cipients. For an Individual old-age re-cipient, the amendment would Increasepayment levels In 31 States; for a couple,and It would Increase payments in 47States.In addition, our amendment retainsthe uniform eligibility rules for all re-CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATE December 18, 1970 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATE S 20633clplents under the adult categories. Thisprovision extends the simplified admin-istration concept proposed under thefamily assistance plan.1rhe amendment would also assure anIndividual aged, blind or disabled personan income equal to more than 80 percentof the poverty level. For couples the mm-Imum Income would be In excess of thepoverty level.STATE FISCAL RELIEFAlmost every State In the Union Isfacing a financial crisis over rising wel-fare costs. Under the proposal of SenatorBmrNnrr and I, each State would havethe benefit of a virtual freeze on In-creased welfare expenditures. The freezewould be based on 90 percent of the Stateexpenditures incurred in calendar year1971. For the first year of operation, ourprogram would provide over $400 millionin direct State savings. In succeedingyears these savings would increase In di-rect proportion to the expected increaseIn expenditures now expected under pres-ent laws. At the present time these costsare escalating by 30 percent a year.I ask unanimous consent that the fol-lowing table showing State savings beprinted in the RECORD.There being no objection, the tablewas ordered to be printed In the RECORD,as follows:STATESAVINGS UNDER FAMILY ASSISTANCE WITH 90.PERCENT FREEZE ON STATE EXPENDITURESIn millions ot dollarsj State share I These amounts would constitute estimated calendar year1972 State expenditures under the new program, except forvoluntary program liberalizations by the States between thebill's enactment and the effective date. Such liberalizationswould be financed by the appropriate matching formulas fortitle IV, pt. E, andtitle XVI.ADDITIONALCOMMITTEE AMENDMENTSMr. RIBICOFF. Mr. President, I alsowant to say a word about other com-mittee amendments to the present wel-fare laws.As I have pointed out, I believe theseamendments to be entirely inadequate.Furthermore, many of them are actuallydetrimental to the present chaotic pro-gram. I shall briefly mention four ofthese amendments.USE OF FEDERAL FUNDS TO SUPPORT THELEGAL PROCESSThe first of the committee amend-ments prohibits the use of Federal fundsto pay directly or Indirectly the salaryof any individual who participates Inlegal actions designed to interpret or testfederal legislation.This Is a particularly unwise provi-sion in a time when it has become ofparamount importance to stressthe need for settling differences within rath-er than without our Institutions.No Federal legislation should be Im-mune from established and recognizedJudicial scrutiny. In our adversary sys-tem of justice, this scrutiny is best de-veloped by legal actions originated bythe parties in Interest. Powerful corpora-tions are fully entitled, in our system, totest laws In courts and deduct the costsof legal representation. In many cases,the only advocates for the poor are com-munity legal services personnel who, bya conscious policy decision of Congress,are often supported by Federal funds. Todeny these funds is to deny the rightof effective advocacy to a large segmentof our society.American justice is based on the theorythat all citizens are equal before the law.By denying effective representation incases Involving laws most directly af-fecting the Immediate lifestyle of thepoor, equality of rich and poor beforethe law becomes a myth.MAN IN THE HOUSEIn addition, the committee has resur-rected a provision permitting States todeny AFDC benefits to children In fam-ilies where a man may be occasionallypresent, even though he has no legal dutyto support the child.In 1968, the Supreme Court struckdown a similar \"man in the house\" pro-vision on the ground that an unrelatedadult in the home has no legal obliga-tion to support the child, and, therefore,the child may be eligible for AI'DC.The committee's amendment set fortha long list of criteria by which a paren,-tal-type relationship could be establishedand the man be held responsible finan-cially for the child.In addition to the unrealistic burdensthis would place on welfare administra-tion, the provision would penalize thechildren for the conduct of the mother.An unrelated man who visits a child'smother, no matter how regularly, can-not be relied upon to provide a meaning-ful parent-child relationship. If he doesmake financial contributions, these arecounted in determining the family'sbenefits now.RESIDENCE REQUIREMENTSIn 1969, the Court durationalresidence requirem\u00e9n unconstitutionalbecause they interfere 'with the right totravel.The committee has sought to reestab-lish residence requirements, requiringthat a recipient only receive paymentsequal to the benefit level of the Statefrom which he moved.Whether this provision would correctthe constitutional defect cannot be pre-dicted, but it certainly would create in-equities between residents of the sameState. It would penalize new arrivalswho were not previously on welfare butcome to require It in the State to whichthey move, and would restrict the mo-bility of the poor who wish to seek bettereconomic opportunityinadifferent State.DEFINITION OF AN UNEMPLOYED PARENTPresent law authorizes a program, atState option to support families in whichthe father is unemployed. This programIs now operational In 22 States. In itsregulations, the Department of Health,Education, and Welfare has defined \"un-employed\" to mean less than 30 and Insome cases 35 hours of work per week.The committee amendment definingunemployment to mean less than 10hours a week or 80 hours a month, Isfar too restrictive, and, in effect, defeatsthe purpose of the unemployed fatherprogram\u2014M'DC_TJp. It Is hard to con-ceive that a man working 12 hours aweek is fully employed. More to thepoint, It is unrealistic to expect that thewages of a few hours of work a week canadequately support a family. A morereasonable definition of employment willprovide greater incentives for the par-tially employed to continue and Improvetheir work skills.Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-sent to have Printed in the RECORD anexcellent article by James Welsh on thefamily assistance plan which appearedin the Sunday Star and an explanationof the benefits accruing to the States un-der this plan.There being no objection, the articlewas ordered to be printed In the RECORD,as follows:[From the Washington Star, Dec. 13, 19701NIXON'S WELFARE REFORM PLAN Is ON LEG-ISLATIVE ROPES(By James Welsh)The Robertso\u00f1s\u2014father, mother and eightchildren\u2014live in a weather beaten framehouse on a farm near Rocky Mount, 14.0.By anyone's etandard8 they are poor. Theyare also what the academics and the bureau-crate like to call an \"Intact family.\" Footnotes at end of table. S 20634Among other things, this means that thefather, James Robertson, lives at home andworks to support his wife and children. Italso means the family Is entitled to no publicassistance except for food stamps.President Nixon's Family Assistance Plan.now facing a final showdown in the Senate,would change all that. Were the plan ap-proved, Jame\u00ea Robertson, beginning in 1972,would command more cash income than hehas ever before seen in his life.Robertson, a burly man in his early 40s,isa farm laborer. He lives rent free but ownsnone of the land on the farm where heworks.\"WORKING POOR\" FAMILYDuring the non-growing season, from Oc-tober until spring, Robertson is lucky to getthree days work a week at about $8 a daywages. Then the work pace picks up, and InAugust and September, when the tobaccocrop is ripening, Robertson is working 10-hour days, and his wife and their oldest boy,James Henry, are in the fields, too.When the crop Is sold, Robertson Is dueenough money to square away a year's ac-cumulated indebtedness to his \"boss man,\"with perhaps a few hundred dollars left over.For 1970, the family's income can be cal-culated at 2,688.Under the Family Assistance Plan, theRobertsons would qualifyas a \"working poor\" family. They would be expected to con-tinue working but wouM also qualify for alarge subsidy. Because of the size of thefamily and becauseof itslow earningsthrough much of the year, that subsidywould amount to about $2,400 in cash, vir-tually doubling the family's Income.But the Robertsons probably will see noneof that government money right now any-way. The Family Assistance Plan, alternatelycalled the welfare-reform bill, is on the leg-islative ropes.The measure has run .bizarreand tortu- ous course over the year, passing the Houseby a surprising margin only to run afoul ofboth conservatives and liberals in the unpre-diotable, stubbornly independent Senate Fi-nance Committee.FACES MANY OBSTACLESAfter months of wrestling with it, the committee rejected the plan. It approvedonly a tiny test of its concepts and last weektied that test provision to a complicated billdealing with Social Security and trade re-strictions.If the full Family Assistance Plan to passthe Senate and then a house-Senate confer-ence committee, it must survive a parlia-mentary obstacle course and the temper oftired congressmen who want to go home.Yet its champions continue to work for It.They hold to the hope that somehow it willbe enacted into law this year.It Is a plan with trail-blazing promise butvast uncertainties, a proposal of such scopeas to aim at new controversial ways of deal-ing with all of America's poor, the millionsof the poor who work end growing millionswho depend on welfare.As such, it bears directly on problems asdiverse as family breakup and the fiscal crisisof state and local governments. And it goesto the heart of the gut philosophical issues:Who in our society Should be required towork, and who should be exempted fromwork? What are the rights of the poor, andwhat are their responsibilities, and by howmuch should they share in the nation'swealth?President Nixon has called the plan thecenterpiece of his domestic strategy. On Fri-day he told a group of governors he may calla post-Christmas special session of CongressIf It falls to pass the legislation.The issue won't die, that's sure. If for noother reason than state and county govern-ments, burdened by soaring welfare andmedicaid costs, are screaming for the kind ofCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEfiscal relief the bill would bring, the 92ndCongress almost certainly will face the prob-lem all over again UitIsn't solved this year.For the short term, failure of the 1970Family Assistance Plan will bring bitter po-litical recriminations, the White House blam-tag liberals, the liberals blasting the Presi-dent and Congress.TWO LARGE SEGMENTSBut if an epitaph must be written for the1970 legislation, it might boll down to a sim-ple, two-part proposition:Nearly all the people who would benefitdirectly from the Family Assistance Plandon't know anything about it; most of thepeople who know all about it are scared todeath of it.To sort this out, it must be rememberedthat the plan deals quite differently withthe two large, distinct segments of Amer.'Ica's poverty population\u2014those who workand now get no benefits, and those who getwelfare but do no work.Nearly all the emotionalism of the debateover the legislation centers on the welfarepoor. Nearly all- the tangible benefits of theplan, though, would go to the working poor.Consider, first, the working poor, and onceagain James Robertson. He has heard of theFamily Assistance Plan, but barely.One day last week, waiting to purchasefood stamps in the social services office ofthe Nash County, N.C., courthouse, he tolda visitor:\"Yes, I think I did hear something on theradio about that,\" he said. \"But I don't reallyknow what it would do.\"He had no idea It might bring him $2,400a year. He was surprised to hear of the plan'ssingle revolutionary premise\u2014cash benefitsgoing to a poor family without that familyfirst going into a welfare category of no-work dependency.Other people in the courthouse that after-noon,allpotentialrecipients under theplan, were simlrarly ignorant or vague low-income families live inNash County\u2014working intact families notnow on welfare, who would average close to$1,000 apiece each year under the plan,North Carolina is home to an estimated119,000 working-poor families. Close to onemillion such families live in the South, morethan half of them white, The national totalis 1.8 millIon families, representing 10.8 mil-lion men, women and children. Under theFamily Assistance Plan, these people wouldbe eligible to share $1.8 billion In incomesupplements.Seldom have so many people who stand tobenefit by so much had so little awareness ofit.Mitchell Olnzberg, former welfare commis-sioner of New York City, now a trouble-shooter for Mayor John V. Lindsay and oneof a small group that has lobbied over themonths for the bill, put it this way:\"Can you imagine the kind of pressurethat would build up if this kind of moneywere available under any other program?Bqt the poor, especially the working poor, arenotanorganizedconstituency.Nobody speaks for the working poor.\" -Thelegislation's unprecedented provisionfor subsidizing the working poor finds nearlyall its opposition among conservatives.CONSERVATIVE OPPOSITIONSome are attracted by the concept but areleery of the numbers involved\u2014those 1.8million working-poor families and billion-dollar-plus cost. Others reject the conc\"outright, looking on these supplements asjust more welfare. Still others aren't so muchfrightened at what would happen Immedi-ately as what would happen later when thepressure grows to push assistance paymentaever upwards.\"For all the defects of the present system,the mind of man is always capable of devis-December 18,1920Ing something worse,\" said Sen. Russell LongIn a wry moment last summer.In the South, coolness to the plan runsdeep. Politicians, farmers and business knowvery well the plan will affect far more thanthe pocketbooks of that region's poor whitesand. blacks.\"This program, if It were to pass,\" saidRObert Patrocelli, deputy assistant secre-tary of HEW, \"would be the most Importantcivil rights advance in the last 15 years.It's the kind of civil rights that comes frommoney in the pocket.\"Liberals might question that, ut manySouthern conservatives believe it. And theydon't like It.Another factor Is the enormous impact theplan would have on the Southern economy.Hundreds of millions of dollars in newpurchasing power would pour in, a seeminglyattractive feature for Southern businessmen.But the Southern economy, even In the partsof the region booming with new industry,Is also reliant to a great extent on cheaplabor.Nash County, N.C., where James Robert-son lives, is representative of the new South.In the last ten years, it has seen Its industrialemployment go up 50 percent, Its per capitaincome almost double.But plenty of farms remain, with plentyof share-croppers, tenants and laboring fam-ilieS. The cucumbers must be picked in thespring, the tobacco harvested and processedin the summer and fall. And there are shirtsto be pressed.\"All I hear sometimes is who's going topress the shirts,\" said James Glover, thecounty's welfare director, possibly the onlyman in Nash County who is for the FamilyAssistance Plan.Would the working poor work less hard orquit altogether if their earnings were supple-mented.Most students of poverty and the assist-ance plan think not. They are thinkingmostly of the people who would have steadyjobs and probably would go right on doingthose jobs.But for those who work at the lowest andmost irregular jobs, the domestics and thefarm laborers, the consequences could beunpredictable.James Robertson said he'd go right onworking at the farm. \"I know I would,\" headded. Another farm laborer, younger, saidthe assistance payments might lead him toget off the farm and try a steadier job. A third'older, said he's been thinking about leavingto make more money. But he likes the farm,and cash from the government would enablehim to stay.But the thfrd.man's boss, farmer C. E. Bell,sees nothing good about family assistance.New York's Ginsberg tells the story of go-ing to Utah recently to speak on welfare re-form to a group of western state legislators.After he described how the Family Assist-ance Plan would help the working poor, onelegislator arose to say:\"Mr. Ginsberg, we're not interested in howmany more people will get welfare. We'reInterested In how many we can get off wel - fare.\"It is a feeling shared by countless Ameri-cans.The welfare rolls are rising at a staggeringrate.At HEW, new figures now beginning to cir-culate show a one-month increase, August toSeptember, of 214,000 people In the categoryof Aid to Families with Dependent Children(AFDC). That's exactly the increase of the\u00a33uth before, July to August, which was theghest Inhistory.At present rates, relief rolls across thecountry are growing at 2.5 mIllion men,women and children ayear\u2014morethan the nation's annual populalton increase.It is a nationwide phenomenon but withextremes to be found not in places like NorthCarolina but In the large urban centers. December 18, 1970 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD SENATE S 20635In Los Angeles County, Calif., for instance,one person in every nine Is on welfare.Marvin Friedman, the county's assistantwelfare director who was in Washington lastweek to urge passage of the Family AssistanoePlan, talked of the impact on local finances,a $50 million boost in county spending onwelfare this year, a property tax rate going upby nearly $1 for every $100 of assessed valua-tion.\"The reactionisfierce,\" said. \"Thewhole thing is a polarizing influence, anJ it'sgetting worse. The pressure is on our countysupervisors to do something. But we're ina box.\"There is evidence that great numbers ofthe welfare-poor also feel boxed in, theirpayments often inadequate to live decentlyand the hard-pressed states searching forways to keep these benefits down.It's because of such dilemmas that peopleuse strong language to condemn the existingsystem. \"A huge phrase.The question is whether the Family Assist-ance Plan will do what the western legisla-tor wants: get people off welfare.If that's taken to mean putting a largeportion of the welfare population to work,the answer is no.The legislation treats pSople on welfarethis way:For the first time,Itsets a minimumincome floor to apply nationally. For a familyof four with no earnings, that payment wouldbe $1,600, paid entirely by the federal gov-ernment. For every extra child, it goes up$300.This income minimum, is also the basefrom which the working-poor supplementsare computed.family of four, for instance,can earn $720 a year and still get the $1,600supplement. For every dollar It earns afterthat, the supplement goes down 50 cents.SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDSFor most families on Welfare, the planmeans nothing In the way of new income,The exception would come in the deep Southand Puerto Rico, where welfare paymentlevels fall below the $1,600 line for a familyof four (Mississippi now pays such a family$840 a year). In theso states, about 217,000welfare families would get a boost in Income.In the majority of states, where welfarepayments are higher than the $1,600 level,the bill requires the state governments tosupplement the federa payment to existinglevels. Welfare families would get no more,no less than they now get, and the attrac-tion to the states is the bill's promise thatthe federal government would pay all theadd-on costs past 1971.The billalso stipulatesa strong workrequirement.To be eligible for payment, able-bodiedadults would have to register for work ortraining.Mothersofpre-schoolchildren would be given the option of staying home.Where the children are old enough to goto school, the work requirement applies.Should this last group of welfare mothersbe required to work?No, says the National Welfare Rights Orga-nizatioth! The requirement is punitive. Moth-ers should be able to stay with their chil-dren If they think that best.Yes, says the administration. The require-ment Is conditional on child-care facilitiesbeing set up. Besides. 70 percent of the non-welfare women in similar circumstances\u2014with school-age children but no husband\u2014hold jobs.But just how many welfare recipients canbe expected to work. On this point, there alsois often more heat than light.In September; the latest month for whichHEW has records. 11.9 million people werein the four federally aided welfare categories(another 900.000 are on general assistancepaid entirely by the states).Of those 11.9 million, subtract 2 millIonold people, 80,500 blind and 910,000 disabled.These are the non-controversial categories,their numbers showing little or no Increase.The 8.8 million people left, are In theAFDC program. It accounts for nearly all thecaseload growth and all the controversy.Subtract another 6.5 million. They are theAFDC children.Of the 2.4 million adults in the program,413,000 are fathers. Most are judged incapac-itated. But 105,000 of these fathers are able-bodied and jobless, their families made eli-gible for welfare in 23 states that have unem-ployed-father programs.Of nearly 2 million welfare mothers, 302,-000 are now working full or part-time. Manydo so under relatively recent provisions ofthe law enabling welfare mothers to earnmoney and still draw benefits. Before lower-ing these benefits, the states disregard thefirst $30 a month the woman makes, plusone-third of what else she earns, plus work-related and child-care expenses.Another 134,000 mothers are in work-train-ing or waiting for enrollment to train underwhat is called the WIN program.That leaves 1.7 mIllion unemployed AFDCmothers. But HEW calculates that nearly 60percent of these mothers have pre-schoplchildren, exempting them from work regis-tration. Of the rest, because of health, edu-cation and other factors, HEW believes onlyabout 50 percent are truly employable.And so of 12 million welfare recipients,those who can be expected to work\u2014the un-employed fathers and the employable moth-ers of school-age children\u2014total about 500,-000.But even with these people, problems re-main. Every survey shows that a large ma-jority of welfare mothers want to work. Butthey face big barriers. Health Is a frequentone. Child care is another. Transportation Isa third.The Nixon legislation' Includes, in Its $4billion price tag, $66 million for work train-ing and child care programs. Yet as NewYork City's Ginsberg points Out, these willnot come along easily. Child care programsare particularly difficult and costly to estab-lish.\"We should face the fact,\" said Ginzberg,\"that not all that many people will comeoff welfare Into jobs. What we can hope foris that the Family Assistance Plan may helpkeep people from going on welfare, frombecoming dependent.\"But no one knows to what exetent theplan will do that.Ginsberg's reasoning and hope are basedin part on a belief shared by PresidentialCounsellor Daniel P. Moynlhan and othersthat money going to working-poor familiescan help reduce the kind of family break-up\u2014desertion, divorce, separation\u2014that leadsto dependency.But men like Ginzberg and Moynihanconcede there is too little Information on thecharacteristics of the army of mothers whoin the last year have entered the AFDC rolls.No one is able to say, for intsance, how manycame out of the ranks of the working-poorIntact families and how many were neverthere at all.Much of the controversy over welfare andattempts to reform continue to turn on\"workf are.\"It may be significant that under the Fam-ily Aisistance Plan the Labor Departmentwould be responsible for administering thework-registrationandwork-requirementprovisions. Heretofore, under WIN and simi-lar programs, welfare recipients came to em-ployment agencies only through referral bywelfare case workers.\"This should help,\" said Los Angeles Coun-ty's Friedman. \"It win eliminate an awfullot of bureaucratic paper shuffling. Besides,if someone loses a job, why the hell shouldn'the apply for a job rather than welfas'erAt the Labor Department, top officials areaware that, as Assistant Secretary Jerry Ho-sow put lit, \"If this program passes, the mon-key's going to be on our back, not anyoneelse's. We won't be able to blame the welfareworkers anymore.\"SEES FULL EMPLOYMENTRosow rejects the argument that the workrequirement is inconsistent with today's tightlabor market, \"By 1972,\" he said confidently,\"we'll be back up to full employment.\"Asked how many welfare clients he rea-sonably sees going to work, Rosow replied:\"If we can get about 100,000 to 200,000people to work in first year or two, we'll con-sidered it a success. I refuse to set up a long-range goal.\"If conservative critics of the Family As-sistance Plan find these figures unimpres-'Isve, they also continue to ask why this kindof reform effort has to be accompanied bypayments to the working poor.The justifications for tying the two to-gether are complex, just as the plan itselfis complex.\"I think it comes down to this,\" said Mrs.Alice Rivlin, one of the plan's designers(nowat the Brookings Institution. \"Payments towelfare families are inadequate. But it's verydifficult to justify raising those paymentsbecause so many working people are paidless than that. The more welfare paymentsgo up the greater the disparity, and thelower the incentive to go to work.\"Supporters of family assistance believe itIs a breakthrough on this dilemma, at leasta start. It would put an income-floor underall families and say to them: Here is an In-centive to work; the more you earn, the moreyou keep.It isn'tall that simple, of course. Theplan's designers worked under several re-strictions, It was prescribed that no family onwelfare would get less than It is now getting,that the states should be given fiscal relief,and that the federal price tag go up by nomore than $4 billion.Within those limits, the designers wereable to knock out nearly all the presentsystem's inequities and \"disincentives,\" thekind that sees a man with a full-time jobworse off than a man keeping only a part-time job supplemented by welfare, or thekind that makes it possible for a womanto quit a full-time job, go on welfare, goback to some kind of work and, betweenwelfare benefits and earnings, do far betterthan the working-poor mother.But they were not able to build in thekind of positive monetary work incentives theconservatives on the Senate Finance Com-mittee wanted. Time and again, told tomake it more attractive for welfare familiesto work, HEW officials came back to saythat was' Impossible within the $4 billionframework of the plan. It was a mathesnati-Cal taffypull that no one could win.Meanwhile, conservative resistance hard-ened. Some of the liberal groups, chiefly JohnGardner's Common Cause, went to work forthe bill. But other liberals, fearing to get toofar away from George Wiley and his welfaremothers, continued to both damn and praise.The President, for his part, turned to talkof getting the welfare bums to work.Time ran on, and now it Is nearly out.Mr. RIBICOFF. Mr. President, I alsoask unanimous consent to have printedIn the RECORD the Impact on the Statesof the revised family assistance plan.There being no objection, the materialwas ordered to be printed in the RECORDSas follows:THE IMPACT ON THE STATES OF THE REVISEDFAMILY ASSISTANCE PLAN\u2014THE Rmxco,w-BENr,IE'rr AMENDMENT1. In the first year of the program, eachState would have to spend only 90 percent ofWhat it spent In CY 1971 on welfare. This S 20636 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEDecember 18, 1970would be a flat ceiling.Thereafter,theState's obligation would Increase only by an amountequal to the Increase In the Consumer PriceIndex between 1971 and the year In question.This means that from now on every Statewould know the dollar limits of its welfareburden, and could budget and set tax poli-ciesaccordingly.The effect of placing thisceiling on State welfare costs is to transferto the Federal Government the entire costof caseload increases, which is the biggestelement in soaring welfare budgets.Quite beyond the cost ceiling involved Inthis anendment, each State would actuallyhave positive fiscal relief of 10 percent of its1971 welfare expenditures in the first yearof operation of the new program. This ismoney saved.2.If any State voluntarily increased Itsbenefit levels in the future, it would receive30 percent Federal matching, up to the pov-erty line, for the family (AFDC) category,and 25 percent matching in the adult (agedblind, disabled) category.3. States are given major new options withregard to the administration of all incomeassistance programs, as follows:a. If the State wants HEW to administerits program of State suppleniention and adultcategory assistance, It will do so with theFederal Government paying full administra-tive costs. This produces major further sav-ings for the States by eliminating presentadministrative costs\u2014a possible total savingof abQut $100 million.b. Further, the States may transfer tothe Federal Government the administrationof remaining Income transfer programs, in-cluding general assistance, food stamps, andMedicaid and surplus commodity eligibilitydeterminations, In these cases, the Statewould pay only one-half of extra coststo the Federal Government of assuming these ad-ministrative functions, which costs shouldgenerally be quite small since HEW wouldalready have most of the needed informa-tion on file for welfare purposes.4. Major amounts of additional Federalmoney would gc to new working poor recip-ients in each State, thereby stimulating eco-nomic conditions.5. Major increases, over $750 million In thefirst full year, are provided for expanded jobtraining, public service employment, andchild care programs, with Increases over thecurrent Federal matching shares in boththe manpower and child care efforts.Mr. RIBICOFF. Mr. President, I alsoask unanimous consent to have printedin the RECORD a letter on the WhiteHouse stationery dated December 17,1970, signed by Daniel P.

Mr. President, I askunanimous consent to have printed inthe RECORDabrief description of thefamily assistance proposal as offered inamendment to H.R. 17550.There being no objection, the materialwas ordered to be printed in the RECORD,as follows:BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FAMILY ASSISTANCEPROPOSAL AS OFFERED IN AMENDMENT TOH.R. 17550I. FAMILY ASSISTANCE BENEFITSA. Eligibility for the new family assistancebenefitEach family with children whose Includa-ble Income (for definition of excluded in-come see below) is less than the family ben-efit level\u2014computed as $500 each for thefirst two members of the family and $300 foreach additional member\u2014would be eligiblefor a family assistance benefit. The amountof the benefit would be the difference be-tween these amounts and the non-excluda-ble income. For example, a family of fourwith no income would be eligible for a bene-fit of $1,600. Every low income family withchildren, including those now eligible underAid for Families wIih Dependent Children(AFDC) and those not now eligible becausean employable father is present (the workingpoor), would be eligible.In determining Income for the purpose ofestablishing eligibility for and the amount ofthe benefit, the following types and amountsof income would be entirely excluded:(1)all esrned Income of adult members ofthe family at the rate of 860 per month plus', of the remainder (the so-called earningsincentive or disregard);(2) food stamps and other public or pri-vate charity;(3) allowances paid to those in job train-ing;(4) the tuition portion of scholarships andfellowships.Subject to certain limitations prescribed bythe Secretary of HEW, the following typesand amounts of Income would also be ex-cludable:(5)all earnings of a child under age 21and attending school;(6) Infrequently earned or small amountsof income;(7) earnings needed to pay for necessarychild care.Remaining earned Income and all un-earnedinoome(nototherwiseexcluded above) would be counted and would there-fore result In a dollar-for-dollar reductionin family assistance payments. Such non-excludable income includes social security,civil service, and railroad retirement bene-fits;veterans compensation and pensions;farm price support payments and soil bankpayments; alimony and child support pay-ments; and interest, rent, dividends and soon.A am1ly with more than $1,500 in re-sources, other than the home, householdgoods, personal effects, and property essen-tial to the family's means of self-support,would not be eligible for family assistancebenefits.B. Definitions of family and childAn eligible family niust consist of two ormore people related by blood, marriage oradoption and living together in the UnitedStates, at least one of whom is a dependentchild (under age 18 or under 21 if attendingschool). The Secretary would apply Statelaw in determining family relationships.C. Registration with public employmentserviceEach member of a family found to beeligible for family assistance benefits wouldbe required to register with a public em-ployment office unless he or she is:(1) unable to wcrk because of illness, in-capacity, or advanced age;(2) a mother caring for a child under 6;(3) the mother, if the father is alreadyrequire4 to register;(4)aperson who is required to care foran ill member of the household; or(5) a child who is either under the ageof 16 or a student.Any person who falls into one of the aboveexempt categories can still voluntarily reg-ister at the employment office.Ifan individual required to register re-fused to do so or refused a suitable trainingor job opportunit.y without good cause, hewould lose his eligibility for family assistanceand State supplementary (see below)bene- fits. The family would continue to receivea reduced benefit, however.A suitable job Is defined in the bill as onetaking into account an indIvidual's health,safety, prior training and experience, dis-tance to work, and other relevant factors. Itmust pay at least the Federal or State mini-mum wage if applicable, or the prevailingwage for jobs not covered by minimum wagelegislation (a job would not be consideredsuitable 11 the prevailing wage Is less than$1.20 per hour).The Secretary of Health, Education, andWelfare Is required to make sure that anynecessary child care services are providedwhere an individual is registered and partici-pating in training or employment.II. STATE SUPPLEMENTATION OF FAMILYASSISTANCE BENEFiTEach State which has an AFDC paymentlevel In November 1970 higher than the fam-ily assistance benefit must agree to supple-ment the family assistance benefit up tothat previous payment level (or up to thepoverty level, If lower). State supplementalpayments would be required for familieswhere at least one parent is absent, Incapcl-tated, or unemployed\u2014the current AFDCand AFDC\u2014UF groups\u2014but not poor.The assistance eligibility rules\u2014.e.g., the $1,500 resources limItation, the defi-nitIon of family and child, the excludableincome provisions (other than those relatedto the earnings Incentlve)\u2014would be madeapplicable to the State supplementary pro-grams, thereby resulting for the first time Innational welfare eligibility standards. TheStates would have to exclude the first $720a year of earned income plus 3 ofthe earn- ings in excess of $720 as an earnings Incen-tive.The Federal government would jovlde 30percent matching for the cost of makingthese required supplementary payments, butthere would be no matching for supplemen-tary payments which exceed the poverty line.lU. ADMINISTRATIONThe bill provides for Federal adminIstra-tion of payments to those in&llgible for &atesupplementation (the working poor), and ofpayments to all families in States where theNovember 1970 AFDC payment to a family offour with no other income Is less than thefamily assistance payment. In other States,the State may opt for program aciminlstra-tion of payments to families eligible forState supplements. However, if a State agrees December 18, 1970 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATE S 20637to Federal rdministration of its supple- mental program, the Federal share of theadministrative, costs would be increased from50 percent to 100percent.This would meanadditional fiscal relief to the States choosingthis option.IV. WORK AND TRAINING PROGRAMA. New program establishedThe existing Work Incentive Program wouldbe repealed and a new program would beestablished to take its place. The Secretaryof Labor would assure the development of anemployability plan for each individual regi-stered with the employment office under thefamily assistance program according to asystem of priority categories.The individuals would then receive theservices and training called for under theplan. The Secretary of Labor is directed toearmark $150 million for public service jobs,to provide employment opportunities forrecipients. Appropriations (no dollar amountspecified)are authorized to meet 90% ofthe cost of the program. A total of $750 mil-lion 'in new training and day care fundswould be made available for members offamilies eligible for FAP benefits.B. Training allowancesEach person participating in the trainingprogram would receive an allowance of $30a month, or the amount of the ManpowerDevelopment and Training Act allowance ifhigher for those enrolled in such programs,in addition to PAP and State payments. TheSecretary would also provide allowances tocover the transportation and other costs as-sociated with tbe training.C. Child care and supportive servicesThe Secretary of Health, Education, andWelfare is authorized to make payments forup to 100 percent of the cost of projects forchild care needed by parents participating inthe work, training, or rehabilitation pro-grams. States would be required to provideother supportive social services\u2014such asvocational rehabilitation, health and coun-seling\u2014needed to enable recipients to entertraining and jobs, and the Federal govern-ment would pay 90 percent of the cost ofsuch efforts.V. AID TO THE AGED, BLIND, AND DISABLEDA. Federal standards and requirementsThe present separate titles for programsfor aid to the needy, aged, blind, and disabledare repealed and a new combined Federal-State program is established to cover essen-tially the same people. Under the new pro-gram, the States could not have any durationof residence or length of citizenship require-ment, or have relative responsibility provi-sions.The States would be required to (1) pro-vide a payment sufficient to bring each singlerecipient's total income up to at least $130 amonth ($230 for a couple), of, if higher, thestandard now in effect, (2) follow the Sec-retary's definition of blindness and severedisability, and (3) use the Federal definitionof allowable resources applicable to the f am-117 assistance program ($1,500 plus home,personal effects and income-producing prop-erty essential to the person's support). Theestablishment of the -high minimum incomestandards for the aged, blind, and disabledis accompanied by the elimination of foodstamp benefits for these recipients.The earnings incentives for the disabledand aged have been increased, requiring theStates to exclude the first $85 per month ofearnings plus 1/ of the rest for the severelydisabled(the same provision which nowexists for the blind), and the first $60 permonth of earnings plus \u00bd of the rest for theaged (the same as the family assistance earn-ings disregard).B. Federal matching provisionsThe Federal government would pay 90 per-cent of the first *65 average payments madeto eligible persons, and 25 percent of the re-mainder up to a limit to be set by the Sec-retary. The Federal government would alsopay 50 percent of the administrative costs.C. AdministrationAs under the family assistance plan, theSecretary could enter into an agreement witha State under which the Federal governmentwowid perform all or some of the functionsInvolved In administering the program forthe aged, blind, and disabled. If the Statechooses to contract with the Secretary tohave him assume these functions, the Federalgovernment would pay for 100 percent of theadministrative costs.VI. OTHER PROVISIONSA. State savings provisionEach State must spend 90%, but no morethan 90%, of its actual calendar year 1971expenditures -formaintenance payments incarrying out the bill's provisions. (The CY1971 base amount would be adjusted an-nually for cost of living increases.) Thus,required State spending In the new pro-gram's first full year would be 10% less thanthe prior year's expenditures.B. Special provisions for Puerto Rico, Guam,and the Virgin IslandsBoth the new family assistance and adultcategory programs apply in these jurisdic-tions, bu.t all of the dollar figures in both pro-grams (except the initial earnings disre-gard\u2014i.e., the first $60 per month in familyassistance)are to be modified (but onlydownward) by the same proportion that theper capita income of each bears to that inthe State with the lowest per capital income.This will not reduce the amounts for Guamand the Virgin Islands, but will result inabout a 40 percent reduction for Puerto Rico.C. PretestsThe bill authorizes tests of the Family As-sistance proposal to begin as soon as possibleafter January1,1971. The Secretary ofHealth, Education, and Welfare is directedto report on these tests to the President andto the Congress by March 1, 1972. Tests of awage subsidy approach to welfare reform arealso authorized by the bill.D. Cost oflivingdifferentials'inbenefit levelsThe Secretary is directed to study the costof living differentials which prevail amongdifferent sections of the nation and developa plan for varying Family Assistance benefitsbased on these differentials. He is requiredto report on his plan to the Congress byJanuary 1, 1972.B. Effective datesThe provisions of the bill would be effec-tive on January 1, 1972, except for the work-ing poor program, which would begin onJuly 1, 1972, and the child care provisions,whichareeffectiveimmediatelyupon enactment.Mr. RIBICOFF.

Iam sure that the Senator from Penn-sylvania may want to make a point oforder himself on this and may ask for theamendment to be withdrawn. It appearsthat he sent itto the desk and theclerk reported the wrong amendment.I detected this earlier and had a pho-tostat copy made of the amendment asIt was reported and that is what is of-ficially before the Senate.I have a photostated copy of bothcopies. I have -een a copy of the amend-Inent as now before the Senate.There has been a lot of confusion inthe Senate in the past few days but thisisevidencethatthe confusionhas spread.I merely call this to the attention ofthe Senate now to say that at an appro-priate time I shall point out the effectsof the amendment.Mr. President, in connection with theSoctt amendment, at first glance It ap-peared that the Scott amendment hadlifted the committee amendment pages7 and 8 out of the bill and transposed Itfor parliamentary reasons In order to get.an earlier vote on the family assistanceplan. I can understand that.I noticed the amendment at the desk,and I wondered if It was exactly right. Iasked Mr. Brownrlgg to get it from theclerk and to photostat the amendmentas reported so that I would have a copy,and I have a photostat of the amendmentas it was read and presented at the desk.The amendii:ent that was transferredto the journal clerk was a differentamendment, but the amendment now be-fore the Senate is the one tha., would bereported by the clerk that is officiallybefore the Senate.I have checked this with the staff, andthe mathematical effect of the amend-ment before the Senate, and I think theSenator from Pennsylvania and otherswill want to know this, is that it does oneof two things. It either raises everybodyto a $221 minimum and repeals 90 per-cent of the Social Security Act. It readsthat no benefits would be paid to any-body with wages of more than $488monthly, and since virtually no one onthe rolls would have wages that high thestaff estimates that the effect would bethat 90 perdent of the people on socialsecurity would have their benefits re-duced to zero under the Scott amend-ment as It Is proposed by the R.ibicoff-aennett amendmentThat is the situation we have, and thatIs the amendment we have pending. Ishall be glad to have the Senator fromPennsylvania review this matter. He candecide tomorrow how far he wants topursue his amendment. I know that wasnot the intent, but that is the amend-ment at the desk, and it is not subjectto modification or amendment.Mr. RIBICOFF. Mr. President, will theSenator yield at that point?Mr. WiLLIAMS of Delaware. I yield.Mr. RIBICOFF. Mr. President, I haveasked the Senator to yield because thedistinguished minority leader was nothere when this discussion began.It becomes apparent that at the deskeither the bill clerk, or the reporter, orsomeone who transcribed caused a littleconfusion, because what the senior Sen-ator from Delaware showed me on oneset of photost.ats has two page 8's.Mr'. WILLIAMS of Delaware. That iscorrect.Mr. RIBICOFF. In the other photo-stat, the journal clerk has only page 7,50itbecomes apparent a page 7 and apage 8 were at the front desk. Whocaused the confusion I do not know. Butthere was confusion as evidenced by thefact that the Senator from Delaware hastwo sets of photostats, one with twopage 8's and one with page 7. Someoneassumed they were the same and leftone out.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Appar-ently they were stapled together. Thereading clerk could have made a mis-take and so could anyone else. But In allfairness to the clerk, two pages num-bered 8 were stapled together as thereading clerk read them. I do not wantto put the reading clerk in the positionof having made the mistake because allhe could do was report the amendmentthat went to the desk, and I have a copyhere.It even has the name of the Senatorfrom Connecticut on Itfirst;that Is crossed out, and it shows that SenatorSCOTT offered it. At the end of page 6 itstates \"Insert the following,\" and thenthere are some words stricken out, thentwo pages 8.The effect of the amendment if adopt-ed is to repeal the Social Security Actso far as page 7 is concerned. We shallhave plenty of time In the next coupleof days to straighten this matter out.The proposal Is intended to include afamily assistance plan now before us.We may need the family assistance planand a greater welfare plan because ifthe whole package Is adopted It wouldstrike out 90 percent of the Social Se-curity Act and place all those people onwelfare.Mr. RIBICOFF. Mr. President, I wishto point out at this time that I cast no as-persions on the reading clerk or theJournal clerk, but it becomes apparentthat somebodyIntransmittingthis amendment, some part ofthe innerworkings of the Senate, made an errorsomewhere. If an error was not made Ifall to understand how the Journal clerkcan have page 7 and the reading clerktwo copies of page 8. So someone causedconfusion, because if the distinguishedSenator had put in two page 8's, howcould the Journal clerk get a page 7?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. No oneknows exactly how It happened, but onecould easily see how it could happen.One set was stapled together, and ratherthan putting in that set one page 7 andone page 8, they put two page 7's in onebill, and the reading clerk got the twopage 8's and the Journal clerk got thetwo page 7's. The page 8's are officiallybefore the Senate.Mr. SCOTr. If the Senator will yield.I do not want to leave the record standwithout saying I submitted the amend-ment, and no matter what the amend-ment shows, if there were flaws and er-rors in it, they were probably there whenI submitted it, so I do not want to blameanyone else.That may have been the case, butoverriding that is the fact that nobodyreally knows what the case was, andoverriding that Is the fact that there arevery Important substantive changes of-fered by the amendment. As the Senatorfrom Delaware says, It certainly is notthe amendment that came out of thecommittee, and, therefore, it ought tohave its right to be heard and debatedand voted upon. We can discuss thepoint of order later, but it certainlyseems to me that when one looks at page6, and then looks at the bottom and seesnothing but a blank space, and then theamendment I offered contains some im-portant and substantive changes be-tween 6 and 7, if there is a chart or tableleft out, normally, if this were not nearthe end of the session, I am quite sure allSenators would agree that we could cor-rect this kind of unfortunate error andget on to the merits of the substance.But we are in a situation where we arenot talking merit, we are not talkingsubstance; we are talking page 7 andpage 8, and I think we will have to havea point or order. The issue is whetherthisisa substantive change In theamendment.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. If theSenator will yield, I examined the amend-ment first with the thought that pos-sibly a point of order would lie. I nowsay that a point of order would not besustained. I agree with the Parliamen-tarian. This Is a change. When 80 or 90percent of the social security law Is re-pealed that Is different from what thecommittee did, and I will debate anyonewho tries to raise a point of order. TheScott amendment Is definitely In order.It is the biggest change in social securitylaws that has ever been proposed In thisCongress. My first impression was thatif this were the mmittee amendment\u2014and I know the Senator from Pennsyl-vania Intends to take pages 7 and 8\u2014Iwas going to consider a point of order,but when I saw two page 8's only wereoffered, I had them photostated; I knewthat all I needed was to have the yeasand nays ordered on this amendment,and we would discuss It In a clear atmos-phere later. I am confident that neitherthe Senator from Connecticut nor theSenator from Pennsylvania would want S 20660topursue an amendment which, if en-acted, would repeal 80 or 90 percent ofthe Social Security Act. It is not subjectto a point of order. I want to make thatclear.Mr. SCOTT. I must say the Senatorfrom Delaware could have told me whathe had in mind with regard to the requestfor the yeas and nays. I knew the Sena-tor had something, because he alwayshas something, but we did not knowwhat it was. Now that we know what itIs, perhaps we will appreciate it at alater date. But the Senator is in error ifhe thinks I am going to withdraw thisamendment at this time.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I amsure the Senator is not going to with-draw it. We are In agreement on that. Iam going to be frank and say that Iwanted the yeas and nays ordered toprevent the amendment from beingwithdrawn. I do not approve of amend-ments being offered In the Senate whereonly the manager of the amendment canchange It. I doubt that the White Houseor the Senator from Pennsylvania willwant a proposal acted on which wouldrepeal 80 percent of the Social SecurityAct. I hope that tomorrow we can reachagreement. I am sure no point of ordercould prevail. I will defend the Parlia-mentarian on that. When the Senatorfrom Pennsylvania proposed to repeal90 percent of the Social Security ActIt Is a change, and I put that in capitalletters.Mr. RIBICOFF. Mr. President, if theSenator will yield, wUle there may besome error, no change was intended, andno change affecting any social securitybeneficiary will ever become law. This isa mighty big bill, with a lot of pages,and there will be plenty of opportunityas we go along perfecting various amend-ments and putting In amendments tomake sure that In some subsequentamendment and in some subsequent pro-cedure the complete charts are put In, sothe Senate will arrive at a point whereIt can vote on a 10-percent social securityincrease and a $100 minimum. I am surethat between the Senator from Delaware,myself, and other Senators, there willnot be dlculty achieving any result ofthat kind.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I am sureof that, because I cannot conceive ofthe Senator from Pernsylvanla wantingto repeal 90 percent of the Social Secu-rity Act. I cannot conceive of that, andthat was what struck me when I saw theamendment at the desk. That is thereason why I wanted to get this out-lined on the RECORD tonight; Senatorsshould be on notice as to the situationbefore the Senate.Mr. SCOTT. I do not think there isany question of good faith on the part ofthe Senator from Pennsylvania and onthe part of the Senator from Connecti-cut In their desire to achieve what thecommittee has so well and carefullywrought; namely, an Increase in certainsocial security benefits. I am not awarehow the Senator from Delaware votedon those Increases, but I will say now,and as often as I have the opportunity,I will vote for them. I am for the socialsecurity benefits. I am for these charts.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEIf the Senator from Delaware had ad-vised us that we were offering a chartwhich would repeal part of the SocialSecurity Act, we could have corrected thematter on the floor ii. less than 30 sec-onds, and we will always be willing tocorrect the matter on the floor In lessthan 30 seconds if the Senator will per-mit us.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. If theSenator from Pennsylvania had soughtmy advice I would have been delightedto have given it to him.Mr. SCOTT. I assure the Senator Iwill. I always do.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I wasnot asked my advice when the proposalwas presented, so I took it at face valuethat he knew what he was doing. Ihave such respect for the Senator fromPennsylvania that It never dawned onme that he did not know what he wasdoing.Mr. SCOTT. I was going to say thatno Senator knows what he is doing whenthe Senator from Delaware gets thi'oughwith him, because he has expertise whiqhis so superior to the rest of us. I agreewith that. That is why we are going tomiss him. But the Senator from Penn-sylvania knew what he was doing, allright. The Senator from Pennsylvaniais not aware to this minute whether ornot a chart had been changed or hadnot been changed. The Senator onlyknows the chart had been changed whenit was In his hands, and another copywent to the desk, and that is where themystery lies.The Senator from Pennsylvania takesthat responsibility in having concurredin sending up the second chart. TheSenator from Pennsylvania's intentionIs good. His purpose Is good. His de-sire to achieve a social security bene-fitIncreaseIsgood. He willgladly consult the Senator from Delaware tosee how, In the exercise of his Infinitewisdom and mercy, we will achieve thedesired result.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. When-ever the Senator seeks my advice Iassure him that he will get It.Mr. SCOTT. I will be glad to acceptthe advice up to the cliff, and there Iwill take a good look over it to see wherewe are going.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I assurethe Senator from Pennsylvania he willbe well advised to be guided by any ad-vice I give him.December 18, 1970 December 19, 1970 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATE S 20801 SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENTSOF 1970Mr. MANSFIELD. Now, Mr. President,under the agreement which has been op-erating and which expires at the conclu-sion of business on Tuesday next, I askunanimous consent that the Senate turnto the consideration of Calendar No.1443, H.R. 17550, and that it be laid be-fore the Senate.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The billwill be stated by title.The LEGISLATIVE CLERK. Calendar No.1443, H.R. 17550, a bill to amend the So-cial Security Act to provide increases Inbenefits, to improve computation meth-ods, and to raise the earnings base un-der the old-age, survivors, and disabil-ity Insurance system, to make improve-ments in the medicare, medicaid, andmaternal and child health programswith emphasis upon improvements inthe operating effectiveness of such pro-grams, and for other purposes.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Withoutobjection the Senate will proceed to Itsconsideration.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, since ourmeetings on yesterday, we have heldsome discussions.Mr. COTrON. Mr. President, we can-flothear the Senator.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ate will be In order.The Senator may proceed.Mr. LONG. &r. President, since ourmeetings yesterday, there have beensome discussions about the most expedi-tious way to move ahead with the so-cial security bill. We have not been ableto reach any sort of agreement.My impression Is that the administra-tion Is very hopeful of obtaining a voteon the family assistance plan or, if notthat, then, In the alternative, a test voteto give some Indication of how the Sen-ate feels about the measure.I have inquired of the possibility ofobtaining a limitation to assure a timecertain to vote on this measure. Thatcannot be obtained at this time.Mr. President, I am convinced that theSenate is not going to pass this measureand that, for whatever political advan-tage It might give on\u00e7 group or the otheror any particular individual, it will betime wasted which could have been usedin passing some of these bills that it Ispossible to pass In this session.Accordingly I will make a motion totable the pending amendment. I believethe Senator from Delaware wanted meto yield to him before I made thatmotion.I ask unanimous consent that I mightyield to the Senator from Delaware with-out losing my right to the floor.Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, I object.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. Pres-ident, do I understand that the Senatorwill be making a motion to table themeasure even before some of us can geta chance to present our case against thebill?Mr. LONG. That is my intention. Butprior to doing that,I would like toyield\u2014Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, reservingthe right to object, I think we ought tohave an up and down vote on the familyassistance plan.I would vote against the motion totable, hoping that we could get a voteon it.I wonder if the Senator might not putsome kind of request to the Senate for alimitation of time on the merits. Perhapswe could arrive at some kind of an agree-ment at some day certain, even if it isafter we come back from Christmas.We should try to get a vote on themerits. Could the Senator put that ques-tion?Mr. LONG. If the Senator wants thatdone, I ask unanimous consent that wevote on the pending amendment, whichis the family assistance plan, at 5 o'clockon Tuesday next.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. Pres-ident, what is the request?Mr. LONG. Mr. President, I ask unani-mous consent that the Senate vote onthe family assistance plan at 5 o'clocknext Tuesday.Mr. WILLIAMS ofDelaware. Mr.President, I presented a unanimous-con-sent proposal for the Senate to vote onall amendments as well as final passageof the bill as amended. Many of thoseSenators now standing up and speakingon this matter apparently were not infavor of that agreement.If we can get consent to vote on theentire bill I would go along with the re-quest. I offered such a unanimous-con-sent agreement before.However, I will not be a party to politi-cal hypocrisy to get a vote on the familyassistance plan when in the back of theChamber It Is being said it will die any-way. That Is the greatest act of politicalhypocrisy I have heard. I have so ex-pressed myself downtown to those pro-posing that this farcical procedure befollowed.If we are to vote on social security anda family assistance plan let us vote onthem in good faith with the Intentionthat it will become law and not so thatMembers can go home and brag abouthaving done something In order to getvotes. We are dealing with people whoshould not be kidded by either politicalparty.I am ashamed that some Senatorsfrom our side would seem to cooperatein that hypocritical suggestion.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is thereobjection to the unanimous-consent re-quest?Mr. DOLE. I object.Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, willthe Senator yield?Mr. LONG. I yield.Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, be-fore the pending measure was called upI promised to call up S. 3835.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, I yield tothe distinguished majority leader forthat purpose. CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATE S 20805SOCIAL SECURITYAMENDMENTSOF 1970 -TheSenate continued with the consid-eration of the bill (HR. 17550) to amendthe Social Security Act to provide in-creases in benefits, to improve computa-tion methods, and to raise the earningsbase under the old-age, survivors, anddisability insurance system, to make im-provements in the medicare, medicaid,and maternal and child health programswith emphasis upon improvements in theoperating effectiveness of such programs,and for other purposes.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, I have nodoubt that this motion should be tabled.T1e parliamentary situation in which wefind ourselves at this moment is that wehave seveial hundred committee amend-ments.Mr. TALMADGE. Mr. President, maywe have order?The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ate will be in order.The Senator from Louisiana may pro-ceed.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, we haveagreed to one amendment, which is anamendment to strike the table of con-tents of the House bill. Assuming we planto pass the Senate bill, that table of con-tents does not belong there.Now, we are on the next committeeamendment, and we have been on it forsome time. This is an amendment tostrike and Insert. We have an amend-ment pending on the insert part, the tailend of the amendment, which we cannotdispose of because a motion to tablefailed on that by a vote of about 1 to 2.Now we are confronted with anotheramendment, one that would be on thefront end of the committee amendment,on the strike part. That is an amendmentthat we will be debating for a long timebefore it comes to a vote\u2014if indeed itdoes come to a vote, which I doubt.In addition, Mr. President, the amend-ment isofferedin such a way that it can-not be amended and there are at least100 different provisions that are extreme-ly controversial in the amendment. It Isoffered as an amendment to an amend-ment.I understand that due to the imperfec-tions in it, which cannot be correctedwithout unanimous consent\u2014and I amunder the impression unanimous consentwill not be given\u2014it would repeal mostbenefits under the social security pro-gram, an unintended defect. But this isthe situation, and obviously this is no wayto legislate.This matter should be brushed aside; itcannot become law anyway. All we aredoing is wasting time. But in the hopethat it might give some indication of howthe Senate feels about the amendment,I move that the amendment be laid onthe table.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. Pres-ident, will the Senator withhold that?Mr. LONG. I withhold the motion for2 minutes.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. Pres-ident, I have opposed the guaranteed an-nual income proposal for reasons I thinkare valid. During the discussion of thisbill as yet I have never been able toobtain the floor In my own right dueto the arrangement from the WhiteHouse offtimes and the minority leader-ship of the Senate that recognition wouldgo to those in favor of the plan. The re-sult has been that none of us who havereasons to oppose the plan have had achance to speak to point out what iswrong with the Ribicoff -Bennett amend-ment.Our committee worked on this proposalfor months. I would certainly hope\u2014andI say this as one who opposes the amend-ment\u2014that the Senate defeats the mo-tion to table which has been made. Iplead with my colleagues to defeat thismotion in the hope that we may havea chance to debate this matter on if.cmerits.I think we should. I suggested a pro-cedure to get it before the Senate. I re-spect the Senator from Louisiana. I un-derstand he is making this motion at therequest of the White House representa-tive. I do not know what they will accom-plish by it. I am sure it will not be agreedto. I hope it is not, and I appeal to allSenators who have said they are for thefamily assistance plan and those who areagainst it to vote against the motion totable so that we may discuss it on themerits. Surely the proponents of thismeasure are not afraid to debate andvote on its merits.I thank the Senator for yielding. I amready to vote.Mr. RIBICOFF. Mr. President, will theSenator yield?Mr. LONG. I yield.Mr. RIBICOFF. Mr. President, I ap-preciate what the distinguished chair-man is trying to do. He is trying to bevery realistic to find out what the senti-ment of the Senate is. I respect the posi.tion of my distinguished friend, the Sen-ator from Delaware, with whom I am op-posite on this proposal. I hope the Sen-ator from De1aware would have anopportunity to state how he feels withrespect to this matter. I know he feelsstrongly against the proposal and hisviews are entitled to be heard. I hope hehas time to explain his views.But personally, I shall vote against themotion to table because if it is presentedit could very well be the only test bywhich the Senate can possibly be heardas to whether Senators are for or againstfamily assistance. It would be my hopethat the Senate would be for the familyassistance program and could so indicateby voting against the motion to table.Mr. WILLIAMS ofDelaware.Mr. President, this will not be a test of howthe Senate feels or would vote on theplan because I for one am going to voteagainst the motion to table. I know thstI am going to vote that way and manyother Senators are, going to vote thatway even though they are opposed to thebill. If a vote is what the Senate wantswe can go ahead and vote, but it is onlya waste of time and proves nothing ex-cept that there are those who are afraidto debate this fantastic proposal on Itsmerits. Apparently they have very littleconfidence of their ability to defend thebill.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, under thosecircumstances I do not believe we wouldDecember 19, 1970 S 20806have a test of how the Senate feels aboutthe amendment so I am not going tomake the motion.Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, will theSenator yield?Mr. LONG. I yield.Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, what theSenator has said makes what I was goingto say completely nongermane. But itseems to me I find myself at this time indisagreement with my friend from Dela-ware, as much as I like him and respecthim.It seems to me we have reached a pointin this session\u2014and we discussed thispoint very frankly when we were by our-selves\u2014where much of what we are do-ing is utterly useless and serves no goodpurpose, and I do not care what the ex-ecutive branch says. As a matter of fact,it might do them some good, and it wouldnot do them any harm, to send some oftheir boy scouts to sit in the galleries fora few hours. They might learn some-thing. Some of them have never even satin galleries of State legislatures and theydo not seem to be well versed in legisla-tive procedures.But whatever the executive branchsaid, and whatever the distinguished mi-nority leader feels compelled to say\u2014and I respect him and try to follow himat least part of the time\u2014the issue iswhether we are going to spend more timediscussing the merits and demerits of theso-called family assistance plan whichhas come out of the committee in oneform, and is before the Senate in theform of an amendment by the Senatorfrom Connecticut,the Senator fromUtah, and others. It has all kinds ofphases. We are just wasting our time,and for what? I was hoping that the Sen-ator from Louisiana would make themotion.I was hoping, whatever our feelingsare on the family assistance plan, thatwe would vote on the question of whetherit is sensible and whether it is going toaccomplish anything for the people ofthe United States and for the prestige ofthe Congress to continue this way. Itis a matter of just plain commonsense,which has been conspicuously lacking forthe last few weeks.I do not like the idea of voting againsta motion to table so as to conceal fromsomebody how I feel. I feel very stronglythat whatever may be the merits of thefamily assistance plan in a differentform\u2014and I do not find too many meritsin it right now\u2014it is useless to take timeon it now, and if the opportunity comesto vote on the motion to table, I amgoing to vote for commnonsense procedurein the Senate to gain some respect fromthepeopleand from theexecutive branch.Mr. LONG. The Senator encouragesme to make the motion. Frankly, whatwe are doing is wasting time. This wel-fare proposal is not going to become lawas part of this bill. It will have to comeoff this bill one way or the other. All weare doing is wasting time until we cometo a decision. It does not require theSenator from Delaware to persuade methat it should not be in the bill. I amconvinced that it should not become law.I move that the amendment be laidon the table.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEThe PRESIDING OFFICER.

This at least gives those ofus who have worked on it for a period ofmonths an opportunity to explain someof the bad provisions in the bill and topoint out why some of us feel that it isin the best interests of our country thatit not be enacted.First, there is much being said in thiscountry about the need for reform. Theadministration'sfamilyassistanceor guaranteed annual income plan has beensold to the American people under theslogan of \"Workfare versus Welfare.\"The present welfare system has beenrecognized by all concerned as a programfull of inequities. Secretary Richardson,in his testimony before the Committeeon Finance, described the present pro-gram as a gigantic failure, and the ad-ministration's new family assistanceplan was described as a major reform.Mr. TALMADGE. Mr. President, maywe have order. We cannot hear theSenator.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Whenthe term \"reform\" is used in connectionwith legislative proposals it means oneof two things. Either it is proposed totake away from someone somethingwhich he is now receiving but to whichhe is not entitled, or it is proposed togive to someone something which he isnot getting but to which he is entitled.While there is general agreement onthe part of all concerned that our exist-ing welfare program is in need of majorreform, it should be emphasized that theadministration bill as it Is now pendingbefore the Senate as reported by theCommittee on Finance, does not embracereform of the existing law. In fact, theSecretary of HEW admitted to the Fi-nance Committee that under the parti-cular proposal now before us\u2014and theauthors will confirm this\u2014not one wel-fare recipient in America, in any Statein the Union, will receive a dime lessthan that which he is now getting underexisting law. We therefore proceed onthe premise that there is no reform inthis bill, assuming there are abuses now.Quite to the contrary, all the inequitiesin existing law will be frozen into thenew program plus some more beingadded.I should like to mention at this pointjust a few of the things that can hap-pen under this bill if enacted.One of the problems of the existingwelfare system we hear much about IsDecember 19, 1970RibicoffSaxbeSchweikerScottSmithSpongSlevensStevensonSymingtonTalmadgeThurmondWilliams, Del.YarboroughPackwoodPearsonPellPercyProutyProxmireRandolphAndersonBurdickCurtisDoddDominickGoldwaterHatfield December 19, 1.970 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATE S 20807the promotion and encouragement ofillegitimacy and of families with genera-tion after generation on welfare.I should like to point out what the billbefore us would do. This bill actuallyprovides a $1,300 cash bonus from theFederal Government to a mother to havean Illegitimate baby, over and abovewhat would be paid if the baby wereborn In wedlock.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, may wehave order?The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ate will be in order.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I cite thisexample which was called to the atten-tion of the committee. Use, for exam-ple, two welfare families.Mr. TALMADGE. Mr. President, a point of order. The Senate is not inorder. I ask that the Chair bring theSenate to order.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ate will be in order.Mr. WILLIAMS ofDelaware. Weasked the department to check how thisbill would work in actual practice in fourStates. We picked two large States andtwo small States. The large States wepicked were Illinois and New York, andwe picked Arizona and Delaware for thesmall States. I said we wanted to pickmine as well as someone else's.Suppose; for example, there are twowelfare families under the provisions ofthis bill, if it passes.Family A has a boy 17, a girl 12, anda girl 6. Family B has a girl 16, a boy 11,and a girl 8. Each family will get welfarepayments based upon the size of thefamily. This means that for this boy oror girl below the age of 18 as dependentsthey will collect, first, $300 from the Fed-eral Government; they will collect alarger mandatory supplement from theState; they will benefit from medicaidif they need medical attention; they willget additional rent allowance, housingallowance, and so forth: they will getadditional food stamps as a result of thelarger dependency in each family.If this boy and this girl get marriedeach family loses one dependent, andtheir welfare payments are automatical-ly reduced proportionately. When thisboy and girl are married they do not getanything under this bill, even thoughthey have no jobs or anything else forsupport. They can starve, so far as thisbill is concerned, until they have beenm,rried long enough to have the firstbaby. Then they become a new welfarefamily, eligible for payments under theAFD program. No provision would helpthem, no matter how destitute they maybe the first year; they have this handi-cap until they can produce the firstchild.On the other hand, suppose the boyand girl want to get married but realizethey cannot do so financially, and thegirl becomes pregnant. He does not marryher until the baby is born. Then theycan move off and start collecting wel-fare as a family of their own, under theaid to dependent children. I repeat, ifthis bill is enacted, by postponing themarriage until the baby is born they cancollect a cash payment in the first yearof $1,300 more than he can if he marriesthe girl before the baby is born.What kind of social bill is this wherethe Federal Government underwrites aproposal of paying a $1,300 bonus tobring that first child into this world asan illegitimate baby? What chance hasthat child in late life? Is that what Sen-ators want to approve.This situation was called to the atten-tion of the committee, and we called itto the attention of the Department. Allthe Department said was, \"We'll correctit next year.\" I say correct it before you Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. It is clearly evident that the bill has been im-properly labeled as a reform package.For example, this bill does not correctthe problems of existing law wherebyfamily breakups are encouraged.Under this bill, suppose a family isliving together\u2014an unemployed fatherand mother and four children. If thefather and mother will separate, eitherbecause of problems or by mutual agree-ment\u2014perhaps only moving across thecorridor in separate apartments\u2014theythen become two families eligible forwelfare, instead of one.This is the bonus in welfare whichthey as a group collect as the result ofsplit families.In Phoenix, Ariz., under the adminis-tration's plan they will get $936 moreby living as a split family than if theylive together. They can visit across thecorridor, and if an additional child isborn it can go on the welfare rolls.Everything is taken care of. But theycollect more welfare if they live in sepa-rate apartments.In Wilmington, Del., they will collectan extra $1,104 in assistance under thisbill by splitting the family. They can col-lect $1,104 In benefits more than theycan if the family stays together.In Chicago, Ill., as a split family theywill collect $2,064 more in assistance.Think of it\u2014$2,064 more benefits underthe bill of the administration if the hus-band will desert, take two children, andleave the wife two children.pass this bill. I will not support any billthat will pay a cash benefit on the partof the Federal Government, a premiumof $1,300, to have an illegitimate baby,more than they would if it is born in holywedlock.Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-sent to have printed at this point in theRECORDthetable furnished by the com-mittee and the staff, approved by theDepartment, relating to the problem ofillegitimacy.There being no objection, the table wasordered to be printed in the RECORD, asfollows: Is this the kind of reform that theCongress wants?In New York a welfare family will col-lect a higher premium on family split-ting; they collect $2,508 more as two fam-ilies than if they live as one family. Theycan collect that every year under thisbill if they will just separate\u2014the hus-band taking part of the children and thewife taking the other children. Again, itis claimed that that is reforming theexisting law. I challenge anyone to saythat that is reform. I say that this ismaking a farce of the situation and thinkwhat this does to these children.As to the unemployed father, theyclaim to have corrected that under thisRibicoff-Bennett plan, but I am not sure.I understand that the Ribicoff-Bennettamendment is intended to correct thatpoint, and I will withhold comment un-til I have had it fully analyzed; I willpass over that point for the moment.The pending bill cannot be labeled un-der the guise of reform in any way,shape, or form.This bill should not pass until correc-tions have been made.I think that these problems are whya majority of us have opposed this billa committee. We have had three differ-ent votes in the committee. Once the billwas unanimously sent back to the De-partment for revision. They brought backpractically the same package. The House-passed bill was rejected by a vote of 14to 1 on a rollcall vote in the FinanceCommittee.

But eachtime the Department comes back andwants another vote. All they want is avote. Is it not time someone thoughtabout a reform of our welfare system in-stead of about the votes involved?Mr. TALMADGE. Mr. President, willthe Senator yield?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I yield.Mr. TALMADGE. Does the Senator re-call what particular revision of this planit is, from HEW? Is it six or seven? Howmany different versions of this plan hasthe Department submitted?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. It is atleast six. I have lost count and I under-stand the present bill was revised againyesterday at the suggestion of the ad-ministration just a few minutes beforethe Senate convened.Mr. TALMADGE. I have lost count,also. It has been six or seven.The Senator will recall the time justprior to adjournment, when we had a re-cess for the elections, when the UnderSecretaryofHealth, Education, andWelfare came in with a stack of amend-ments, about 12 inches high, that nomember of the Finance Committee hadever seen, and no member of the FinanceCommittee knew what was contained inthere. He insisted on the Finance Com-mittee voting at that particular time ona stack of amendments they had neverseen. Does the Senator recall that?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. That iscorrect. The bill as proposed consisted ofapproximately 400 or 500 pages and wasonly delivered to the offices of Senatorsabout 5:30 the night before.Mr. TALMADGE. I never got mine.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I did not,either, until about 20 minutes before thecommittee met.We walked in, and the Departmentsaid, \"All we want is a vote.\" The com-mittee gave them a vote and rejectedit by a margin of 10 to 6.Now we are told the Department wantsanother vote in the Senate even thoughthey accept the fact that it cannot getcleared in a conference before adjourn-ment.Mr. TALMADGE. The Senator hasbeen in the Senate 24 years. Has he everseen such irresponsibility as that duringthat period of time?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Never.And I hope it will be 24 years before ItIs repeated.Mr. TALMADGE. So do I.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. As theSenator knows, that vote was on the eveof the adjournment, just before the re-cess for the election. As I recall, it wasjust a few days before. The committeesoundly rejected that proposal. The com-mittee did not have any Idea what itwas, and by unanimous vote, as I recallIt, we Instructed the staff to analyze thebill which the Department had sentdown to us that morning. We had neverseen it before. We instructed the staffto send each member of the FinanceCommittee to our homes during therecess an analysis and a copy of the bill\u2014to get It printed and send each a copyand an analysis\u2014In order that we couldstudy it, so that when we came backCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEInto session in November our Committeewould be ready to proceed In an orderlymanner and to vote intelligently for oragainst it.I have here a letter sent by Mr. Vailof the staff of the commitee, which Iwill put in the RECORD, that he sent tome and the other members of the com-mittee on October 26. This was after therecess. I read the letter dated October 26,1970:U.S. SENATE,COMMIT'FEE ON FINANCE,Washington, D.C., October 26, 1970.Hon. JOHN J. WILLIAMS,Milisboro, Del.DEARSENATORWILLIAMS: You will recallthat during executive session of the FinanceCommittee on Tuesday, October 13,Mr.Veneman, Under Secretary of the Depaxtmentof Health, Education and Welfare, submittedto the Committee a revised version of theFamily Assistance Plan and urged that theCommittee vote on It before the recess.The revised plan, described as a 'core\" bill,covers more than 150 pages. The Committeefelt that a major amendment of such pro-portions should be carefully studied beforea vote was taken. Therefore, it directed thestaffto publish the'core\"bill,related amendments, and supporting tables, docu-ments, and charts to be prepared by theDepartment and submitted to the Commit-tee. It was the Committee's instruction thatthis material together with an analysis pre-pared by the staff of the Committee be for-warded to each member of the Committeeat his home during the recess. In this wayall of the members would have an oppor-tunity to study the Administration's mostrecent welfare proposal before the Commit-tee reconvenes in November.I had hoped that the printing job andthe staff analysis could have been completedbefore now. The staff analysis of the Oc-tober 13 version has been completed. Un-fortunately, the Department apparently Ismaking further revisions in the material sub-mitted on October 13. Although the versionpresented to the Committee has been set Intype, the Department has not completed itsproofreading task\u2014apparently because of theaddtllonal drafting and rewriting they areundertaking. It would seem to serve no usefulpurpose to send you the staff analysis if the\"core\" bill we have analyzed is still being changed by the Department.I wanted to let you know why we have notyet complied with the Committee's Instruc-tion to promptly forward the printed materialto the members at their homes.Sincerely,TOM VAIL.Mr. Vail apologizes for the fat thathe could not get the information fromthe Department to complete the analysis.A second letter from Tom Vail, chiefof staff, dated November 5, states thatthe material has just been received.Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-sent that this letter be printed in theRECORD.There being no objection, the letterwas ordered to be printed in the RECORD,as follows:U.S. SENATE,COMMITTEE ON FINANCE,Washington, D.C., Senate,Washington, D.C.DEAR SENATOR WILLIAMS: I am copy of Administration's revised revi-sion of HR. 16311, the Family AssistanceAct of 1970.You will recall that Under Secretary JohnVeneman of the Department of Health, Edu-December 19, 1970cation, and Welfare submitted a revised re-vision of the bill to the Committee duringIts executive session on October 13 and askedthat the Committee vote on the new versionof the bill. Instead of voting on the newversion at that time, the Committee decidedthatit should be printed, together withother materials prepared by the Departmentand an analysis by the staff, and sent tomembers of the Committee during the recess.The enclosed Committee Print representsthis document. A brief analysis with com-ments, tables and charts prepared by theCommittee staff is printed on blue paper atthe beginning of the document. This is fol-lowed by materials prepared by the Depart-ment, the text of the Department's revisedrevision, and additional amendments pre-pared by the Department for possible Com-mittee consideration, all printed on whitepaper.If you have a copy of the bill submittedby Mr. Veneman on October 13, you will notethat the Department's latest version of thebill differs in a number of respects from theOctober 13 versIon due to the changes madeby the Department fairly continuously be-tween that date and the date of final print-Ing. Unfortunately, It was this continual re-vising which prevented us from printing thedocument and forwarding it to you sooner.Sincerely,TOM VAIL.Mr. WILLIAMS ofDelaware,Mr. President, in the November 5 letter hesaid he had just received the informa-tion, and yet they came before the com-mittee on October 13 with a 150-pagepackage which they wanted us to voteon without reading. It took the Depart-ment another month to get back to thecommittee a printed version.This is the kind of confusion and lackof cooperation that has been existing inthe Department of Health, Education,and Welfare. I know there is confusionin the Senate, too, but I do not have anyidea of what must be going on dewnthere. I will say this: neither does any-one else connected with that Department.I have never seen such irresponsiblemanagement or lack of knowledge as towhat is going on as exists in that De-partment. Department officials came be-fore our committee, and never have I seenwitnesses coming before a committee rep-resenting an executive department whoknew so little about the proposal theywere asking Congress to adopt. I waspresent on one occasion when it ap-peared the former Secretary of Health,Education, and Welfare had not evenread the bill and did not have the slight-est idea what it was all about.Mr. TALMADGE. Mr. President, willthe Senator from Delaware yield?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I yield.Mr. TALMADGE. Does not the Sen-ator recall when Secretary Finch camebefore the committee and attempted topresent a bill, and the distinguishedSenator from Oklahoma (Mr. HARRIS)dressed him down and told him thatwas the poorest presentation he hadever seen anyone present to a committeeof the U.S. Senate since he had beena Member of this body.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I do re-member it. I have that very quotation bythe Senator from Oklahoma (Mr. HAR-RIS) in front of me. Let me quote it:With all due respect, gentlemen, I believethis is the most Ill-prepared presentationthat I have seen since I have been in the December 19, 1970Congress of the United States. I am reallyamazed that some of these very simplequestions do not get a very quick and easyresponse\u2014such things as just asked a min-ute ago about medicaid, and the questionsI asked yesterday about the day-care costs.It seems to me that those are things whichought to have been easily available, becausethey ought to have been thought out in ad-vance when you put this plan together;Mr. President, that opinion was theunanimous sentiment of the FinanceCommittee. After that miserable presen-tation had been made it was so apparentthattheDepartmentdidnot know what the bill was all about that the com-mitteeinterruptedthe hearingsand called an executive session. The Secre-tary of the Department of Health, Edu-cation, and Welfare was called in andasked to go back and rewrite the bill.Meanwhile we suspended the hearingsuntil HEW could report back and wecould at least find out what was in thebill.Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, will theSenator from Delaware yield?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I yield.Mr. STEVENS. Is the Senator referringto Secretary of Health, Education, andWelfare Richardson?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. No, toformer Secretary Finch.Mr. STEVENS. Secretary Finch.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Yes.Mr. STEVENS. Was the comment theSenator from Oklahoma (Mr. HARRIS)made concerning Secretary Finch or Sec-retary Richardson?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. It wasmade at the time Secretary Finch wasthe head of HEW.Mr. TALMADGE. Mr. President, maywe have order in the Senate?The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. FANNIN). The Senate will please be inorder.Mr. WILLIAMS ofDelaware.Mr. President, for the information of theSenate, that quotation by the Senatorfrom Oklahoma appears in the com-mittee hearings which are on Senators'desks under the date of April 30, 1970.Mr. STEVENS. If the Senator will yieldadditionally, briefly, it appears that theSenator has made some rather broadstatements regarding the ability of thesetwo men who have been Secretaries ofHealth, Education, and Welfare in theperiod that I have been here. I am sortof amazed to hear such a broad state-ment being made, coming from my goodcolleague from Delaware, concerningeither ofthese gentlemen. I wonderwhether the Senator could tell me howthis occurred, how they happened toget so many versions of the bill? Was itbecause of the complete reticence on thepart of the Finance Committee to con-sider the bill at all In the first instance?What led to the many versions that thebill has gone through?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. If any-one has the answer to that question,I would appreciate hearing it. I do nothave the answer. The committee sched-uled very promptly the hearings on thisproposal. The committee has tried towork diligently with the Department, buteach time we kept getting some reasonCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEwhy the Department had to ask for moretime.It definitely was not the committee'sfault that the Department kept changingits mind.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, will theSenator from Delaware yield?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I yield.Mr. LONG. Inasmuch as it has beensuggested that the Finance Committeewas dragging its feet, I would like to pointout that the hearings were scheduled bythe committee the day after the Housepassed the bill, to begin within 2 weeksof House passage. It was at the requestof the Secretary of Health, Education,and Welfare that the hearing was post-poned, but when he did come before thecommittee and questions were asked, thekind of things that have been discussedhereinthis Chamber, theanswers showed how ill-considered the bill was atthat point.The Senator from Oklahoma (Mr.HARRIS)saidthat was the poorest pres-entation he had ever heard on any majorpiece of legislation. He said that he hadcome prepared to support it but he hadheard the rumor that the administra-tion was planning to scuttle the bill inthe committee and perhaps that was whythere was such a poor presentation bythe administration witnesses. The Secre-tary denied that it was intentional. Hesaid that no one could have contrivedsuch a scenario as had been witnessedthere that day, that no one could havecontrived to give a presentation that wasmade so poorly.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. That iscorrect.I would like to dispel the thought thatthe Finance Committee is responsible forthe bill's being before the Senate at thislate date. The question has been asked,how come so much delay in considera-tion of the administration's family assis-tance plan, implying that this delay wasentirely the result of dilatory action onthe part of the Finance Committee. Letme make the record straight on that.Mr. HANSEN. Mr. President, will theSenator from Delaware yield?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I yield.Mr. HANSEN. In an effort to shed somelight on this question further, as posedbythedistinguishedSenatorfromAlaska (Mr. STEVENS) letme suggestpossible reasons why so many differentrevisions were made of a plan. I as-. sumed that it must have been scrutinizedand studied, and must have been pre-pared and followed with diligent efforts.I would hope that the HEW would nothave come before Congress with a planthat had notbeenconsideredand scrutinized and examined from everyangle, because we are aware that withrespect to medicare and medicaid, everytime an actuarial study has been madeof these programs, the cost has increased.The cost that will result from their con-tinued Implementation as compared withthe revenues that are Intended to fundthem, indicate that over a period of 25years, those two programs will be $216billion in the red.Now with that experience behind It, Icannot think that the HEW would havecome forward without having a con-S 20809sidered plan, But while these may havebeen many revisions\u2014I have forgottenhow many\u2014I can only say to my goodfriend from Alaska that as we examinedthe proposals in the family assistanceprogram, against the backdrop of thegoals that the President hoped to obtainthrough welfare reform it just did notseem that the proposal accomplished theobjectives the President had in mind.The incentives that would encouragepeople to move from welfare into theprivate sector of the economy as workingcitizens could not be identified.As the distinguIshed Senator fromDelaware has pointed out and as the dis-tinguished Senator from Georgia haspointed out as well, on different occa-sions, In the city of New York, a workingmother withfourinthe family\u2014afemale head of the family with four per-sons, if that mother were to take thebenefits that are available to her as aresident of the State of New York, livingin New York City, taking advantage oLpublic housing, and ifshe got low-income supplements which would beavailable to everyone in the State, If shetook advantage of medicaid and medi-care, if she used available food stamps,and took advantage of the such otherprograms available there, she, withoutworking at all, could have the equivalentof $6,210.000 Income per year.But If she went out and took a job andwent off welfare and moved into the typeof activity that the President of theUnited States has called for in this billand was to find employment and earnthrough tht employment $7,000 a year,she would be $1 poorer by working andearning $7,000 a year than she would beif she had not turned a hand.I think this is the sort of questioningthat came about in the Finance Com-mittee that may have caused our goodfriends at HEW to come forward with noless than seven revisions.I can say this. I do not know. I amspeculating. I do not know what was intheir minds. All I know is that when themembers of th committee started to ex-amine the bill and got to probing andquestioning, along with the distinguishedchairman of the committee, it seemed asthough the bill did not accomplish whatIt was supposed to accomplish.I am in complete accord with thePresident of the United States. I wantwelfare reform. I want to give the peopleof this country an opportunity to go towork and to give them some incentiveto go to work.I do not believe this bill accomplishesthat. I am delighted that we rejected themotion to table. I do not suspect the dis-tinguished chairman of the committeehad his heart in it when he proposed It.I believe that he, too, shares the feel-ing that we ought to understand this, weought to realize that this Is a charade,that the bill does not accomplish whatwe might hope that It would accomplish.Mr. President, I have spoken longerthan I should have. But I would like tosay to my good friend, the Senator fromAlaska, that I do not know why HEWcame up with seven different plans. Itseemed as though every time we startedfInding fault and picking their plan S 20810 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEDecember 19, 1970apart to show what was wrong with it,they would then come in with a newset of charts.Is that correct?Mr. WILLIAMS ofDelaware. MrPresident, the Senator is correct.I would like to call attention to thechart in the rear of the Chamber. Itshows how this bill, if executed, wouldwork.Much has been said to the effect thatthis bill only provides $1,600 for a familyof four. Everyone asks, \"What are youcomplaining about? That is a very smallamount for a family of four.\"I agree. But the $1,600 is only thebeginning. This $1,600 direct Govern-ment payment automatically triggers Inthese mandatory supplementary pay-ments which are outlined on the chartsin the rear of the Senate Chamber.These are the mandatory payments tothe family in addition to the $1,600 fromthe Federal Government. In New Yorkthis $1,600 payment triggers in $2,156additional State supplement payments,which are 70 percent Federal participa-tion. This brings the family's cash in-come to $3,756, tax-exempt; but that isnot all.In addition to that they can get foodstamps with a value of $312.The food stamp bonus was $312. Thenthere are medicaid benefits for this fam-ily which cost on an average of $1,153annually, plus another $989 in rent sup-plements or public housing. This is atotal of $6,210 for this family of four inNew York City.Suppose the city letter carrier that isdelivering this welfare check has a fam-ily of four. His income is taxable, andafter he pays taxes he has $6,209 left,or $1 less by working and earning $7,000a year than the same size family getsif on relief.Is that a work incentive? That is whatis called a work incentive program underthe administration's bill. It is an incen-tive for what? It is an incentive to goon welfare and to quit work.Let us examine this New York chartfurther. If they earn $1,000, they wouldhave after taxes $6,746 in money andbenefits in kind. If they earn $7,000 thefamily of four, after taxes, will have$6,209 left, or $1 less than if they re-mained on welfare.In other words, they talk about atraining program to train a man orwoman to improve his or her earningcapacity. Suppose the head of this fam-ily is earning $6,000 and goes to a train-ing school and gets promoted to $7,000a year; he has $1,300 less income thanhe would if he had spit in the boss' eyeand never gotten the promotion. Hewould have $7,512 in cash and benefitsunder this billif he earned $6,000 ayear, but if he earns $7,000 he dropsback to $6,209 after taxes.Suppose a plant is operating with em-ployees on a $7,000 wage base, and theunion leader sits down and negotiatesan increase to $8,000. If the manage-ment agrees to raise their salkries to$8,000 a year average, each worker wouldhave $6,781 after taxes. That is for afamily of four. That is the result if theyget an increase of $1,000, or a raisefrom $7,000 to $8,000. But If their unionis on the job and will consult with themanagement and say, \"Now, boss, in-stead of raising these salaries for youremployees $1,000, cut them all back to$6,000.\" The employee with a family offour earning $6,000 would have aftertaxes $7,512 in cash and benefits inkind, an increase of $1,300 over what hewould have if he continued to earn$7,000.Is that the kind of work incentiveprogram that Senators want to approve?That is not the kind of incentive that Isupport. This bill i2 enacted will pay apremium to the man who slides backinto welfare.The so-called work incentives are inreverse. I have been here in Washingtonfor 24 years. I have never had Potomacfever yet. I hope I do not get it beforeI leave if such a proposal as this is theresult.We had the department check theseexamples for four States. We did not askthem to check the 50 States, but I askedthem, \"Do you have any reason to thinkthat if you check any one of the other46 States the result would be different?\"They said, \"no.\" The answer was em-phatic, so we accepted these statisticsas a national pattern.We told them that if they had anyother State that would come up with abetter showing for their so-called workincentives program we would like to have it.They did not have it.Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-sent that this chart relating to how thisbill if enacted would work in New Yorkbe printed in the REcORD.There being no objection, the tabula-tion was ordered to be printed in theRECORD, as follows: BENEFITS POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE TO 4-PERSON FEMALE-HEADED FAMILIES IN NEW YORK CITY N.Y. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Now, toget back for just a moment to how thisbill has been handled by the FinanceCommittee. Surely it took time. It tooka lot of time. I have spent more timeon this bill than I have on any otherbill that has ever been before the Fi-nance Committee.The bill was first recommended by thePresident on October 2, 1969. The Waysand Means Committee reported It onMarch 11, 1970. It passed the House onApr11 16.I might say that when the Presidentfirst sent this proposal down I endorsedIt. I thought It sounded like a great plan.That was before we analyzed the bill.Mr. President, before I proceed fur-ther I would like to make one point veryclear. My criticism of this bill Is In noway directed at the author of the pend-ing amendment, the Senator from Con-necticut, because he has been most co-operative. He has worked hard to tryto get a realistic program.But the Senator from Connecticutwanted this tested first. As of January1970 there were 10,436,197 people on re-lief in this country.IfthisbillIs enacted this numberwill Increase to 23,784,300, or more thandouble, and there is no reform as to cor-recting abuses under existing law.Mr. TALMADGE. Mr. President, willthe Senator yield?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I yieldfirst to the Senator from Connecticutand shall then yield to the Senator fromGeorgia.Mr. RrBICOFF. Mr. President, theSenator Is correct. This is a very compli-cated amendment.There are still many doubts In mymind. I do not feel so self-confident thatI have all the answers. I know from longexperience that human nature does notalways coronn with what the social sci-entists may present in a legislative act.That is why I was so anxious to have apilot program.My feeling is that before this planshould ever go into effect, there shouldbe a pilot program. The Rlbicoff-Bennettproposal contemplates a pilot programthat gives an opportunity to determinewhat Is right and what is wrong with thislegislation.That would give us an opportunity be-fore July 1, 1972, to make whatever cot'-rections have to be made. I believe thebasic plan Is a good one.My feeling Is that within the thinkingof the Senator from the minority leader, andmyself, we could work out a proposal, ifwe were allowed to work it out, to allow itto come before the Senate before Tues-day night.Personally, I am ready to vote on anytype proposal at any time. I would likea test vote. As I have discussed with thedistinguished Senator from Delaware, Ibelieve there are vehicles by which we canachieve the result we desire and the re-suit the President desires and also whichthe Secretary of Health, Education, andWelfare desires, without casting any as-persions or reflections on the majorityparty or any member of the minorityparty who may disagree.There are great complications here,and as men of good will we should recog-nize the realities of the legislative situa-tion and work out a series of actionswhich would inure to the benefit of thepeople of this country and this body.Mr. WILLIAMS ofDelaware. Mr.President, I thank the Senator. There isno doubt in my mind that a plan could bedeveloped. What the Senator has saiddoes not change the fact that weekswould pass before we could get adequateInformation in the committee. The De-partment shopld have worked with us,but we did no hnve the cooperative spiritwe should have had from the executivebranch. Each time I sat down for nego-tiations I was told, \"Yes, I am glad tonegotiate with you If you will vote forthe plan as It is.\"They closed their minds to any loop-holes we exposed and seemed to resentany form of criticism of their originalproposal.Mr. President, that Is not the way tonegotiate. There are problems in con-nection with the existing welfare system.One of the greatest needs confrontingthis country is the reform of the existingwelfare system. I said that years ago. TheSenator from Connecticut and I wereres,onsible for committee hearings whichbegan an examination of some of theproblems in the medicaid program withthe thought of putting together a reformpackage.I do not recall a single proposed revi-sion or correction of the medicaid pro-gram which was not mutually agreedupon by the Senator from Connecticutand me. I do not recall a single disagree-ment we had during all the time in try-ing to make revisions In that program.I think a correction of these loopholeswhich I am outlining here could havebeen achieved had we had similar coop-eration from the executive branch. I maydisagree with the Senator from Connec-ticut on the wisdom of enacting this leg-islation first and working it out later,but we can disagree as gentlemen, andI think we could have sat down andworked out a solution here if the admin-istration had not been so adamant on itsposition. This bill would double the wel-fare rolls In this country before we getreform.On March 25, while-the bill was pend-ing in the House, I inquired of the Sec-retary of Health, Education, and Welfareand asked for a statistical analysis of thebill as reported by the House committeewith specific emphasis on the amount ofCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEpayments to be made to recipients in thetwo largest States and the two smallestStates. It was on my suggestion that theCommittee on Finance Insisted on thisinformation before we opened hearings. Iwanted to know what Joe Doakes andTom Doakes would get, not just a politi-cal speech. The request was filed onMarch 25, and it was not until 9:30 p.m.on April 28, the evening before SecretaryFinch was to testify, that the materialwas received. During the testimony ofSecretary Finch the chart showing thestatistical analysis of the bill was pre-sented to the committee by SecretaryFinch and his associates, and the mathe-matical result of this legislative proposalas shown by the charts shocked both thecommittee members and the Department.The information I requested throughthe Committee on Finance was that allexisting data dealing with welfare betaken into consideration and what theeffect would be, assuming the bill werepassed by the Senate in the form it hadbeen passed by the House. I wanted toknow how much welfare recipients infour selected States would receive. I shalldiscuss the charts in detail later. The re-sult of the-first bill was even more glar-ing that Itis on these second chartsshown here today.After the charts were submitted thecommittee called the Secretary back inexecutivesessionand unanimously\u2014Democrats and Republicans\u2014suggestedwe should suspend hearings and canceluntil the Department went back andprepared a revised bill.I have already quoted Senatof HARRIS'comments. The department returned thebill to the Committee on Finance In fiveinstallments beginning June 11. The finalamended version was delivered to thecommittee on -June 23, 1970, or a littleover a month after it had been sent back.A couple of days prior to that date wewere advised that Secretary Finch hadresigned and that the new Secretary ofHealth, Education, and Welfare was tobe appointed. This delayed the commit-tee hearings upon the request of the De-partment so that the new Secretary, Mr.Richardson, could be confirmed and alsoso that he might have an opportunity tofamiliarize himself with the bill and pre-pare his testimony.The schedule was approved by the Sec-retary of Health, Education, and Wel-fare that hearings resume July 21. Theywere adjourned 2 days later, on July 23at the request of the Secretary, In themidst of his testimony, so that he couldtake a weekend trip with a presidentialparty goint out west. Hearings resumedon July 28.Mr. WILLIAMS ofDelaware. Mr.President, after the hearings resumedthe Secretary of Labor came down totestify, and he too asked for an adjourn-ment of a week bec'ause he was scheduledto appear at the Governors' conference.The committee complied with his re-quest for a postponement.Mr. President, I have pointed this outto show that the delay was not our com-mittee's fault.Now I would like to mention how thisbill if enacted would affect my State. Iwish to call the attention of SenatorsS 20811to the chart in the rear of the Chamber.The first charts had even more glaringinequities. We have had so many chartsand changed bills that it Is hard to keepthem separate.The chart will show that under thisbill a family of four would receive $1,600;that is, $500 each for the first two mem-bers and $300 for each child. In addi-tion to this $1,600 there is the $188 Statesupplement,the food stamp benefitstotaling $828, as well as the medicaidand housing benefits. Under this bill thisfamily of four would get $3,775 in cashand benefits in kind. These are all tax-exempt benefits. This is $447 more thanthe family would have if the head of thefamily had full-time employment at theminimum wage.If that same individual earns $5,000a year he would have a total in cashand in kind of $5,358, but if he gets apromotion to $6,000 he loses $57 and goesback to $5,301.Can this be called an incentive towork?Mr. BYRD of West Virginia. Mr. Pres-ident, will the Senator yield for a unani-mous-consent request?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I yield. SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENTSOF 1970The Senate resumed the considerationof the bill (H.R. 17550) to amend theSocial Security Act to provide increasesinbenefits,to improve computationmethods, and to raise the earnings baseunder the old-age, survivors, and disabil-ity insurance system, to make improve-ments in the medicare. medicaid, and ma-ternal and child health programs withemphasis upon improvements In the operating effectiveness of such programs.and for other purposes.Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, will theSenator yield for a question?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Yes. Ishall proceed with these charts later. Ishall yield at this time, because we can not get this information presented to-day. I promised to yield to some of theother Members. I think it is importantthat the Senate understand this planand understand just what is embracedin it because not much has been saidabout the plan on its merits.In passing, I will make just this com-ment. We were told that the plan wasendorsed by the Governors conference.The Governor of Missouri was beforeour committee in behalf of the Gover-nors conference, and he presented ourcommittee with a resolution endorsing S 20812thefamily assistance plan on behalf ofthe Governors conference. He said atthat time he had supported that en-dorsement. Then he continued that hethought that he had discharged his dutyas chairman of the Governors confer-ence and would like to tell us his opin-ion of the bill after he had read it.He went on and gave a devastatinganalysis, recommending against the en-actment of this bill. Four of the fiveGovernors testified and found fault withthe bill and said it should not be enactedinto law until it was tested and proved.They pointed out the disastrous resultsit would have in their States. I shall re-fer to that testimony later.I wanted to dispel the idea that thisplan has been endorsed before our com-mittee by the Governors conference. Iknow Governors have wired in recentlythat they want this plan. They have beentold how much it would benefit theirStates if they could get it. I shall dis-cuss that a little later to point out thatthis plan has been misrepresented, thatit does not represent a saving to theStates in their overall expenditures tothe extent that they have been led tobelieve. In. fact, the results will be alarger cost to the States.I yield to the Senator from Iowa.Mr. MILLER. Looking at the chartsthe Senator has had set up in the rearof the Chamber, I notice it is stated thatthe figures represent current law andmedicaid. I ncftice that, in the exampleof Delaware, for all brackets of incomefrom zero on up, the total for the medic-aid payment would be $437, but lookingat the other chart covering New York,thetotalaverage medicaid paymentwould be $1,153. I was goIng to ask tieSenator how such a difference couldexist between two cities.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. EachState can set its own welfare paymentlevel, and the Federal Government par-ticipates on a matching basis. The Statescan balloon its cost. Therefore, to thatextent it is a wide-open ticket into theFederal Treasury on a matching formulabasis. This bill, however, dces not correctthat open-end formula either.Mr. MILLER I appreciate the answer.Is it not true that that was one of thereasons why the Senate Finance Com-mittee indicated t the department thatthe plan as originally sent over by theHouse, which had been worked on by theHouse Ways and Means Committee, wasdefective in that it would cause a dis-crepancy which would result in a dis-incentive to work? As a result of that,did not the department come back to theFinance Committee and suggest a familyhealth plan to replace medicaid in thecase of this program?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Yes, andthe officials of the department said theywere going to come back in with a rec-ommendation that food stamps could beturned into cash, and I notice some ofthe representatives of the Governmenthave indicated the food stamp allowancewould be $800, raising the paymentsfrom $1,600 to $2,400. If that took placeit would increase the cost significantly.The department also said they were go-ing to come in with a health plan nextyear. This proposed bill would become apart of the health plan. Payments wouldbe made by the wage earners, and thento make that equitable they were goingto deduct it. from those on relief. Theywould deduct from welfare recipients acertain amount of withholding on theircash benefits in order to pay part of theirhealth insurance.The mathematical result would bethat if the health plan which they hadin mind went into effect next year itwould reduce the cash benefits proposedunder the bill. It would mean that wewould start them with a certain amountof cash this year, with broad medicalcoverage, and next year we would reducethat amount.My argument in the committee waswhy did we not take the health plan andthe food stamp plan and all they plan todo and consider it all in one package.These welfare benefit programs areinterrelated.I was amazed when the Departmenttold our committee that in deciding onthe so-called $1,600 cash plan for a frm-ily of four, they had made no effort torelate it as to how it would affect vari-ous programs that would be triggeredinto operation. For example, if a persongets State supplemental help he auto-matically gets medicaid. In New Yorka man earning $6,000 would under thisbill get $459 State supplement. That trig-gers medicaid benefits for his family,which, on the average, is worth $1,153.If he earns just a few doPars overthat he loses his medical insurance over-night, in one notch. We cannot correctthose notches if we do not recognize thatthey exist. This man earning $6,000 darenot get an increase in salary to $7,000.If he does he will take a cut in take-home pay of over $1,300. Yet they cailthis a work incentive program. It is themost diabolical incentive program for in-creased dependency on welfare I haveever seen presented to Congress. This isan incentive not to work. It is an incen-tive to pay people more not to improvethemselves In life. If they do not go towork or if they do not make an effort toimprove their present earning capacitythey have more benefits from the Gov-ernment.I have said for some time that we needa revision of the present welfare laws. Ihad hoped we could get that reform Inthe last year I shall be serving In the Sen-ate. It is something we have been advo-cating for years. it is something we needdesperately, but we do not have it here.I hope, regardless of the outcome in thisdebate, Congress will go ahead and re-form the welfare system. But when Itdoes, it must not freeze into the new lawall the inequities of the present law.Some say that politically Congressdare not touch existing programs. Con-gress should not freezebenefit thateverybody is getting, and say that laterit will enact the reform.To me reform is taking away fromsomebody something he isgetting towhich he is not entitled, and the otherside of the coin is that it would be givingto somebody something he Is not gettingbut to whch he is entitled. It takes bothsides of the coin if we are going to re-form welfare. The administration hasbeen looking at only one side; and thatDecember 19, 1970is,that it dare not reduce anybody's ben-efits, so they propose to correct it bybringing everybody up to these Inequities.Once Congress does that we will expandand double the welfare rolls.I think what we need is a program thatwill give a real incentive to Americanpeople to get off welfare so that they willwant to make more to bring home totheir families. There is no way in theworld we are going to correct our welfareprogram other than by getting one thatwill financially encourage a man to sup-port his family. There is no other wayto correct the present welfare system,which we have been perpetuating gener-aton after generation, than to give thefather or the mother the dignity of ajob, no matter what it is, the dignity ofa paycheck, the dignity of coming hometo his children with money to supportthem.That is the reason I say we have tofurnish jobs. Let them earn It. Let themwork, and encourage them to Improvetheir lot in life, and by all means en-courage them to establish families, yes,get married and establish their famiPes,rather than pay, as I pointed out earlier,a $1,300 cash premium to a young cou-ple if they will have an illegitimate babybefore they get married. It is indefensibleto support a bill that encourages illegiti-macy and call it reform. That is not re-form; that destroys everything we standfor in this country\u2014good family life.Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, would theSenator yield?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I yield.Mr. MILLER. I am trying to bring outa part of the history of the developmentof this whole thing in the Committee cnFinance, specifically with respect to med-icaid and the so-called family healthplan.It Is my recollection that at the timeof the original hearings and the charts,we found this horrible discrepancy andthese horrible disincentives in the plan,and then, when the department cameback with a number of revisions, one ofthe major revisions that It had, whichwas incorporated in a series of charts,was doing away with medicaid and re-placing it by this fami'y health plan,with a contributory feature; and it wason that basis that certainly a good num-berofthedisincentiveshavebeen cranked out of the plan. Does the Sen-tor from Delaware recall that?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Yes, I do.Mr. MILLER. Does the Senator fromDelaware recall that?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Yes, Ido.Mr. MILLER. Does the Senator fromDelaware also recall that when some ofthe members of the committee expressedgreat interest in the family health plan,we were told that it would not be pos-sible for the department to prepare andpresent the legislative language for thisplan until sometime early next year?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. That Iscorrect.Mr. MILLER. And that was severalmonths ago, that they said that, was Itnot?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Yes.Mr. MILLER. I would like to ask eitherthe Senator from Delaware or the pro-CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATE December 19, 1970 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATE S 20813ponent of the amendment, the Senatorfrom Connecticut (Mr. RIBIc0FF), If Icould have his attention, whether or notthe pending Ribicoff -Bennett amend-ment makes any provision at all for thisfamily health Ipan.Mr. RIBICOFF. No. There is no provi-si6n for a family health plan. As theSenator has stated, the administrationproposed that at the beginning of thecoming year, 1971, it would submit tothe Finance Committee and to Congressits own health program, to take care ofthis basic need.I think it should be pointed out thatunder the Ribicoff -Bennett proposal, theoverall plan does not go into effect untilJuly 1, 1972, for the working poor andJanuary 1, 1972, for others.Mr. MILLER. Will the Senator fromDelaware permit a further question bythe Senator from Iowa to the Senatorfrom Connecticut?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I yield.Mr. RIBICOFF. And I might add thatany revisions that had to be made be-cause of the health provisions that wouldbe presented could be revised betweenthe time we come back, whenever that is,in January 1971, and July 1972. I havehad in mind all the time that somewhereduring the course of this testing, wewould watch the testing very carefullyin our oversight function, to see how it isworking out, and then, as a result ofwhat we discovered in these tests, un-doubtedly we would be called on and wewould want to initiate revisions of ourown.Mr. MILLER. The Senator from Con-necticut has made a point, but he knowsthat I, and I would guess practicallyeveryone else on the Finance Committee,thoroughly agreed as far as the testingprogram wa concerned. But the Sena-tor's response seems to indicate thatsince this plan would not go into effectfor quite a while, the Senate and Con-gress would have a chance to do some-thing about medicaid and put in a familyhealth plan in the interim. I suppose ifCongress can do that, we could also sug-gest that sometime before this wholething goes into effect, Congress can dopractically anything else with the planby legislative action.Mr. RIBICOFF. Yes, they could.Mr. MILLER. If that is so, then, ofcourse, that raises the natural question,why must we go ahead on a plan that isto become effective? Why not just thetest program?Mr. RIBICOFF. I think what we aretrying to do is recognize that to put thisplan intoeffectisvery complicated.The administration has a lot of workto do even to get ready for July 1, 1972.It could not get ready for July 1, 1972unless it felt that there was a reasonableor good probability that this was goingto become law. If we did not have thetriggering device that this plan goes intoeffect July 1,1972, if the tests provedsuccessful, and that if Congress did notreject, by either House, the proposal,then it could not make all those plans.This is very complex, involving manypeople, something like 14,000 in the 50States and it is going to take a great dealof planning.That is where those of us on theminority of the committee differed fromthe committee itself as to merely want-ing the tests; we wanted, the tests plusa trigger that it would go into effectJuly 1, 1972.Ithinkthesearethesafeguardsagainst the fear of many who havedoubts about this plan. I cannot quarrelwith anyone who has doubts. I mustconfess that I have some doubts, too.But that is why we thought of the deviceof having the test plan, on a good basisin two areas.Several Senators addressed the Chair.Mr. MILLER. Will the Senator fromDelaware permit a further question?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Well,Mr. President, if I may interject for justa moment, I do not wish to monopolizethisdiscussion.I am about halfwaythrough my analysis of this bill. I wouldlike to wait and pursue this later andyield the floor to other Senators, afteryielding first to the Senator from flu-nois, who has been waiting patiently.Then, I understand we are coming in at9 o'clock Monday\u2014Mr. MANSFIELD. Yes, Would theSenator fromIllinoisyield on thatpoint?Mr. PERCY. I yield.Mr. MANSFIELD. Would the Senatorfrom Delaware give the Senate an ideaof about how much longer he intends topursue this subject this afternoon?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I wouldlike a reasonable opportunity to pursueit. Several Senators want to leave, andI think this is important enough not topresent it to an empty Chamber. I p-preciate the attendance we have hadhere, which has been very good. But Iwould not want to tire us out. We didcome in at 9 this morning, and I waswondering if there would be any objec-tion, at the conclusion of this discussionand yielding around, to asking unani-mous consent that after we resume con-sideration of this bill Monday, I couldproceed and call it the same speech.Mr. MANSFIELD. May I say that asfar as the leadership on this side is con-cerned, we are perfectly agreeable tosuch a proposal, but may I also say that Iwould hope that sometime soon wewould have the opportunity to vote onthis proposal, in which the administra-tion has such a significant and overrid-ing interest, either in whole or in part,on the basis of a time limitation or onthe basis of the agreement suggestedsome days ago by the distinguished Sen-ator from Delaware; because we oughtto face up to it in some way or other, andinsofar as we can, ob1iate the Presi-dent's expressed wish or desire or sug-gestion that if we did not face up to thisand several other proposals, he intendsto consider withholding his signaturefrom the resolution which has passedboth hours calling us back on January21.So I am perfectly agreeable to whatthe Senator suggests. I only wish therewere some way we could get down tovoting on this conglomerate bill, just sothe Senate can dispose of it one way oranother.Several Senators addressed the Chair.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I willyield in just a moment.I point out that the Senator from Mon-tana, the majority leader, has been verygracious and cooperative about this, andI will comply with either request. I canjust take my chances to get the floor.I know that with a recess a Senator isallowed to speak twice. But I will leave itto the Senate as to how they want toproceed. I have tried not to monopolizethe time.As the Senator knows, since this billhas been before the Senate the pastcouple of days, by a prearrangement be-tween the minority leadership and theWhite House I specifically was not recog-nized until others who were speaking forthe plan had presented it.Mr. MANSFIELD. Just a moment. Isthe Senator referring to me?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. No; I saidthe minority leadership. The majorityleader has been most cooperative.Mr. MANSFIELD. I know nothingabout that.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. The lead-ership on our side\u2014Mr. GRIFFThT. Mr. President, will theSenator yield?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I was notrecognized before, and this was the firstopportunity I have had to speak on thisplan since it has been before the Senate.I have done a great deal of work onthis bill. I think I am presenting somereasons why there are problems here andsome valid points which I think can bethought about by other Members of theSenate. I have brought out some of them,and I would like them to be looked atover the weekend so that Senators willrealize what they are voting on. I shouldbe able to complete this analysis Monday.There is another point which showsthe danger of legislating hastily on aprogram such as this. The Senator fromConnecticut will agree with me on thispoint. I am not quarreling with the par-liamentary procedure in which this wasbrought before the Senate. It is underthe rules of the Senate, but when Con-gress tries to legislate on the floor, prob-lems develop.Considerthis:Suppose the Senatepasses the Ribicoff-Bennett amendmentas it is now before us. It is offered asan amendment to the Scott amendmentin order to get it into a position whichdeals with social security increases. I as-sume Senators will vote in good faith.Then after that, suppose they approvethe Scott amendment as amended by theRibicoff amendment, the family assist-ance plan, which is what the administra-tion is asking for. So what will have beendone? These amendments, if approved asnow before the Senate, would repeal .90percent of the Social Security Act thatis now on the statute books and reduceall those present beneficiaries to a wel-fare status. Perhaps that was not in-tended, but that would be the result.Mr. RIBICOFF. Mr. President, will theSenator yeld?Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, willthe Senator yield?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I willyield in a moment. S 20814 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEDecember 19, 1970It may be an inadvertence, but theSenator from Pennsylvania (Mr. SCoTT)sent to the desk two pages numbered 8rather than 7 and 8. The mathematicalresult is that if Congress approves thesetwo proposals, for'which we are asked tovote affirmatively, we will have repealedthe social security benefits for every pres-ent social security recipient who did notestablish an average monthly payroll of$468 a month. That means that morethan 11 million people who are drawingsocial security benefits today would notget their checks after the date of enact-ment.Someone said it is not as bad as itsounds; that they are picked up underthe family assistance program, and theywill be eligible under the pending bill.Do Senators want to advocate that dras-tic step? Yet that is what we would get.It may be that this was a mistake, but itis a mistake that was discovered onlybecause some of us read the amendmentsbefore they were voted upon. This showsthe danger of introducing a bill or spon-soring a bill and voting for it withoutreading it. That is why I say this billneeds to be analyzed. I venture to saythat very few Members of the Senatehave read either of these amendments.That is understandable in the closingdays of the session.There is no contradiction of this pointas to the amendments' effect. I am notsuggestingthatourminorityleader wantstorepealtheSocial SecurityAct\u2014Mr. MANSFIELD. It must have beenentirely inadvertent. Any one of us couldmake the same mistake.Mr. WILLIAMS of Dlaware. Thesponsor would not have made the mis-take if he had taken the time to read itbefore he submitted it. Conceivably, hadthe Senate complied with the requestthey would have called the roll and voted\"yea\" for it. It would have been the law;and the Social Security Act would in ef-fect have been repecled. I am sure thatthis would have been detected before itbecame law, but it outlines the danger ofa rush in the-closing dys of the session.I say that those points need to be ex-amined, and that is why I think it is in-defensible to propose a new bill this latein the session that has already been re-jected three times by the committeehandling it.This afternoon, since 3:30, is the firsttime any of us who oppose this guaran-teed annual income plan have had achance even to get recognized while thebill has been before the Senate. It is notthe majority leader's fault. Let me em-phasize that.I presented a unanimous-consent re-quest to vote on this bill with all the vari-ous amendments, and there are no con-troversial amendments in this bill thatare not mentioned by the President as\"must\" legislation. He called for enact-ment of the family assistance plan, yes,or the guaranteed annual income, whichis a more appropriate name. He said hewanted a vote. But he also said that hewanted a vote on the quotas and theTrade Act. Both are in the same para-graph.I say this to the majority leader andothers: Can they get consent to limit timeon this bill? I tried it the other day. Butcan they get consent to vote on this billnow before the Senate, all the amend-ments, vote them up or down\u2014the TradeAgreements and all the rest? Can theyget that consent? The answer is \"No.\"So I ask, What is proposed to be done\u2014vote on this amendment alone and thenstop and let them know that everybodyis for family assistance? It is a wonderfulname. I wish the administration had put\"motherhood\" in there. That would havesounded equally good, although I wouldhave wanted to modify that suggestionand say \"wedded motherhood.\" I do notwant to see the Government pay a pre-mium if one has a child out of wedlock.Yet that is what the pending bill woulddo. Surely Senators want that corrected,but this bill cannot be amended underthe parliamentary rules to correct, it Wemust vote on this bill as it is before theSenate. The sponsors of this bill wouldpay a cash premium to a mother to havea child out of wedlock.Also; the Social Security Act will be90 percent repealed under the amend-ments we are being asked to support.The sponsor of that amendment shouldhve tried to read the amendment beingoffered. I think that would be good ad-vice to those who offer amendments thenext time, because there is no questionbut that the amendment at the deskin effect repeals the Social Security Act.I shall refer to another provision inthis bill, and then I will yield. This billestablishes welfare benefits in States, ifit is passed, ata level substantially higherthat is being paid to all the draftees inthe military. That means that if this billis passed the salary of these militarypersonnel will be supplemented by wel-fare. For example, suppose a man work-ing in the labor force and earning $6,000,$8,000, or $10,000 a year is drafted intothe military. We know the low pay hegets. This bill provides that his wife andchildren get part of that supplement outof welfare to meet the poverty level ofpayment.What kind of law is that where it putsa man who has never been on welfare,who prides himself that he provides forhis family and children, and a salary asa soldier drafted into the service of ourcountry in Vietnam\u2014perhaps he loseshis life\u2014at a salary lower than the wel-f are family is to get. I proposed that thesalaries of these military personnel bebrought up to at least equal the amountthat we pay the same size family onwelfare in this country.I do not support a proposal underwhich we we will continue to draft menand send them to Vietnam at the riskof their lives to defend this country andat the same time pass a bill that says,\"We will take care of your family. Donot worry about them. Do not worryabout your children. We have a bill herethat will automatically make your familyeligible for welfare the day you enter theGovernment's service in the military.\"I say that that is an outrage. I do notthink any Member of the Senate wouldhave voted against an amendment tomake sure that this soldier, who is serv-ing In our Army, can get from the com-bination of his military pay and familyallowance the same amount of money,and get it as a check payable for his serv-ice to the country, so that his familydoes not have to resort to what he mayconsider to be the stigma of welfare.We talk about reforming the system.That is another inequity that shouldhave been correct yet the bill before theSenate does not correct it.The two amendments before the Senate, I repeat,go in the opposite direction; togetherthey repeal 80 percent of the social secu-rity law. Over 80 percent of those draw-ing social security benefits today wouldnot be eligible for benefits on the enact-ment of this bill as it is before the Sen-ate, and as it is not subject to an amend-ment\u2014that is, the Scott-Ribicoff-Ben-nett combination, If it is adopted.The administration says It is for thesetwo amendments. I ask anybody in theadministration\u2014I ask any Senator tostand up and say that he would vote forthe final passage of this bill If these twoamendments are approved as presentlydrafted. Yet, they cannot be amendedunder the rules of the Senate. Let usfind out where the Senate stands onthese points. That is why I am willingto call the roll.Mr. GRIFFIN. Mr. President, the ma-jority leader indicated that he wouldagree to the request of the Senator fromDelaware, ifit were agreeable to theminority leadership. The Senator fromPennsylvania (Mr. SCOTT) is not on thefloor at the moment. But I think I couldspeak for him. He did say earlier todaythat he wanted to be sure the Senatorfrom Delaware had adequate time tomake his presentation. I am sure, if hewere here, the minority leader would notobject to the request that the Senatorfrom Delaware resume his presentationon Monday.However, I should like to point outthat the Senator from Delaware indi-cated he would like to resume the floorat 9 a.m. I believe he may be overlookingthe fact that at 9 a.m. the Senate willbe considering the SST issue under aprevious arrangement, and the Senatewill not return to the social security billuntil 3 p.m.Mr. WiLLIAMS of Delaware. That Iswhat I meant. When we resume consid-eration of the amendment.Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it isthe intention of the leadership to afforda 1-hour period on Monday next to beset aside for a tribute to the distin-guished Senator from Minnesota (Mr.MCCARTHY) who isretiring. We havebeen doing that for the past coupleofdays now.Ifthe Senator fromDelaware were to propound a unani-mous-consent request to be recognized,we would enter no objection to such re-quest, provided that it were to providefor time later In the day.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. That Isright.Mr. GRIFFIN. As of now, we will goback on this at 3 o'clock on Monday af-ternoon.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I shallmake the request that when I concludetoday, I may resume my remarks as partof the same speech whenever we resumeconsideration on Monday on this samebill. I want to accommodate myself tothe leadership. It Is rather ironic that December 19, 1970 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATE S 20815the Senate is filibustering on another billfrom 9 o'clock to 3 o'clock and then isbeing asked to consider this importantlegislation in the dark hours of the eve-ning. But considering what is proposedin the bill I can understand that. Maybethe sponsors do not want the light ofday to shine on some of the inequitiesin this bill, but I assure Senators thatwith a modern lighting system some ofus are going to enlighten them. Again, Ido not want this to be interpreted thatI am going to filibuster. I have been here24 years, and I have never taken part inone; and I am not now.All I want is an opportunity to ex-plain my views. I know that the Senatorfrom Connecticut would be the first toadmit that this bill would not be beforeus even now if it had not been for thefact that I and others who oppose thebill made quorums and gave consent tomeetings of the committee during ses-sions of the Congress. It would have beena simple matter at any point to get upand say,\"I object to the committeemeeting.\" This was not done.I frankly did not want to have to goback to Delaware, having objected to thisbill, without a chance to outline why Iobjected. I welcome this opportunity, andI have no fear as to the outcome of thevote after the Senators understand thebill.Mr. GRIFFIN. I would like to say inaddition, that if the minority leader werehere, he would want, and I do, too, to joinwith the majority leader in his strongexpression that we do want to get to avote on this amendment. Of course, thosein opposition should have a reasonableopportunity to explain their side. Firstand foremost, of course, is the Sena-tor from Delaware. But I do share thestrong feelings Of the majority leaderthat we should, after all the facts are in,get to a vote.Beyond that, It should be said, on be-half of the minority leader, that if therewas an inadvertent error in his amend-ment, and apparently there was, it canbe corrected. After we vote on the Ribi-coff amendment, a correcting or perfect-ing amendment to the Scott amendmentcould be offered and considered to cor-rect the error that the Senator fromDelaware has pointed out.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. If some-one found a flaw in the amendment ofthe Senator from Connecticut we couldnot offer an amendment to correct that.I am merely outlining what the problemIs. Some Members are assuring their con-stituents that they are for these so-calledamendments. I want them to know thatthey are endorsing a proposal whichmay or may not be amended but which,if approved, will repeal 80 to 90 percentof the Social Security Act of this country.I will ask this question: In order to seewhen we can get to a vote could I get aunanimous-consent agreement now tolimit the time on all amendments beforeus so that we know we could disposethem? I offered a unanimous-consent re-quest the other day for 6 hours each totitle III, which is the trade amendments,and 6 hours on the catastrophic insur-ance\u2014I think we had that for 4 hours,but I would take either\u2014and put a timelimit on this plan for a guaranteed an-nual income. I wonder, can we get con-sent of the minority leader or the actingmajority leader to the point that hecould agreetoa unanimous-consentagreement to limit time on the tradeagreements and all amendments on thisbill?Mr. ERVIN. Mr. President, I object.The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.EAGLETON). Objection is heard.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I see theSenator from Massachusetts is on thefloor ready to object also. I appreciatehis position.Mr. KENNEDY. I did not object.Mr. WILLIAMS ofDelaware. no objection? Good. ThenI renew my request\u2014Mr. RIBICOFF. Mr. President, if theSenator will yield, I will not object, butI would like to comment in reply to theSenator's remark, before a unanimous-consent request is made. As a matter offact, I will join in such an unanimousconsent being granted. But there aresome comments I would like to make,If the Senator will yield to me.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I am gladto yield. The request was made, I say tothe Senator, but it was objected to.Mr. RIBICOFF. That is right, but Iwould hope there would be no objection.I do believe that the Senator from Dela-ware, as well as all other Senators whooppose the bill, are entitled to a greatdeal of time to explain their positionsin opposition to this measure. It is cam-,plicated. I agree with the majority andthe minority leaders, and the chairmanof the committee, and the assistant mi-nority leader that we would hope sometime, within a reasonable time, to be ableto vote on the Ribicoff-Bennett proposal.That should be voted on after adequatetime has been given to the Senator fromDelaware to explain his opposition.I notice on the news ticker that thePresident, in a meeting with the leadersof the minority, mentioned the fact thatthe minority had an obligation to passhis program. So far as I know, there isno opposition basically from the majorityto taking a vote on the family assistanceplan. Most of the opposition to taking avote on the family assistance plan thatthe President seems to want so deeply,comes basically from his own party.I also want to point out\u2014I do not haveto defend the Senator from Pennsyl-vania (Mr. ScoTT)\u2014that it is not truesocial security may be Impaired.I think that there are a number ofSenators here,to whom this mattershould e explained. When the Senatorfrom Pennsylvania put in his amend-ment, he put in a table that includedpages 7 and 8. How it took place, no oneknows, but the reading clerk, when itwas presented to him, had two pages 8and the journal clerk had two pages 7.So in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, and inthe record, on page 20620 appears page7. What the distinguished Senator fromDelaware had, when he went up to thereading clerk, was page 8, indicatingthat pages 7 and 8 were submitted withthe amendment by the Senator fromPennsylvania. For some reason, the Journal clerk got page 7 and the read-ing clerk got page 8, due to some con-fusion.May I point out to Senators when theyvote for the Ribicoff proposal that atthat time, when the vote is taken, it isdefinitely intended by either the Sen-ator from Pennsylvania, myself, or anyone of us to offer an amendment to theScott amendment to correct this error.At that stage of the proceedings suchan amendment will be in order\u2014andsuch an amendment will be offered bythe Senator from Pennsylvania\u2014to cor-rect the situation so that we would havetables 7 and 8. Not one single personin the United States would be deprived ofone penny of social security benefits ifwe voted yea on the Scott proposal asamended by the Ribicoff-Bennett pro-posal.I think we should make the recordclear on that point so that if we votefor the proposal we are not jeopardiz-ing the rights of the social security bene-ficiaries.When I talked to the Senator fromPennsylvania about the position that wasadopted\u2014and which position the Sena-tor from Pennsylvania made absolutelyclear\u2014he said:Abe, in what we are doing, I want to makesure that we in no way Jeopardize or keepthe social security beneficiaries from receiv-ing the 10 percent social security Increaseand the $100 minimum, because I am totallyfor such a proposal.So, therefore, this was due to someinadvertance. How it happened, I do notknow. I put the blame on no one. ButI do want to make it clear to the Sena-tor that the social security beneficiariesin his State will not have their interestsjeopardized.Page 35 of the Senate Manual outlinesthe procedure whereby that would bemade possible.I would hope we would grant theunanimous-consent request of the Sen-ator from Delaware. I would also hopethat we could agree before we left thefloor on a time certain to vote on theRibicoff-Bennett proposal. The Presi-dent of the United States desires it. Themajority and minority leaders desire it.I believe that a majority of the Senatedesire it.Whether this vote takes place on the22d, the 23d, the 28th, the 29th, or the30th makes no difference to me. But Ibelieve that the President of the UnitedStates is entitled to a vote.I would suggest this respectfully tothe President of the United States. I donot think the Senate of the United Statesneeds any threats. I believe we are try-ing to do our job. I resent the Presidentof the United States making threats to-ward the majority because I do not be-lieve there is any other member of theSenate fighting harder for the Presi-dent's family assistance plan than thisSenator from Connecticut.I want to say that I resent any reflec-tion cast on the majority leader or anySenator on this side.Mr. WILLIAMS ofDelaware. Mr.President, I thank the Senator. I amcertainly not casting any reflection onthe motives of any Senators. It is veryobvious that this is not a political issue. S 20816 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEDecember 19, 1970I am on this side of the aisle, and I amexpressing opposition to the proposal. Ido say that as a loyal member of theRepublican Party I always enjoy hear-.ing on both sides of the aisle eloquentsupport for the President of the UnitedStates and his various plans.It is wonderful to have such support,even though it may be on some bill onwhich we disagree.The President also said he wantedhis trade bill.They are both in this same bill. Theywere both recommended in the samemessage in the same paragraph. ThePresident asked for, one right after theother.Suppose I renew my request at alater time since we are all loyal sup-porters of the President of the UnitedStates. I made it clear that I am goingto vote against the proposal, yet I amwilling to enter into a unanimous-con-sent agreement after I have had a rea-sonable time to present my views. Othersalso want to speak, and they must beprotected.The same thing should be true aboutthe trade agreement section. We aretalking about the President's proposal.I remember the President in Februarymade an eloquent plea to Coiigress aboutthe need for the legislation dealing withthe prospective strike of the railroads.Congress never acted. The President re-peated his plea time and again. Nothingwas done. We almost had a bad situationdevelop with the strike a couple weeksago. All we did was to postpone that for3 months.Why was this bill not c'rnidere'1?I think that should have been acted on.I would welcome a chance to vote on it.That bill has been before Congress for along time. It has not even had the cour-tesy of committee consideration.I only wish that we could have had thisenthusiasm and loyal support of thePresident's proposals before. Even thoughit is late I welcome it.I am willing to vote on this proposal.But on the other hand, there is not asingle Member of the Senate\u2014and ifthere is I will yield to him now\u2014that willsay there is any possible way under theparliamentary rules of the Senate, evenif we vote on the Ribicoff amendmentand on the Scott amendment, that itcould ever possibly become law unless wevote up or down on the trade bill and onthe welfare sections.If all that those who are sponsoringthis are after is only a vote g that theycan go home and brag to their constit-uents how they voted, that is one thing.I can tell the Senate how it can do thatvery easily under the rules. We can in-troduce a Senate resolution and ask forits immediate consideration saying thatit is resolved that all of those voting forthe resolution are for work incentivesand for motherhood\u2014perhaps I had bet-ter say wedded motherhood, because itwould sound better back home. The Sen-ate could pass the resolution and couldalso put in the social security benefits.We could say that we are for a 10-per-cent increase. Why not say 20 percent? Itsounds better, and Senators agree nowthat it will not become law anyway Un-less we break this impasse on the tradeand welfare amendments. Congress willbe promising something to a lot of peo-ple on the eve of Christmas that everySenator knows cannot pass. I will yieldto any Member of the Senate right nowwho would say that it could. There are25 of us here. I will yield to any Senatorwho will stand up and explain how wecan possibly vote on final passage of thebill before us even if we vote to approvethe Ribicoff amendment within the next5 minutes and approve the Scott amend-ment 5 minutes later. I would like someSenator to tell me how it can become lawwithout facing up to the trade agree-ment and ending this filibuster. We can-not do it.I do not see any takers who are willingto say we can do it under the parlia-mentary situation.The Senate can vote on the proposaland go home and tell the social securityrecipients that they are for a 10-percentincrease, for a 15- or 20-percent in-crease\u2014I do not know why we shouldstop at 10 percent. Senators know theywill not get it anyway. Why should westop at $100 minimum. Make it $150.This bill dies at noon on January 3,and every Member of the Senate knowsit. It is not going to become law even ifwe approve the Ribicoff amendment un-der the present parliamentary situation.I say that as far as one Senator is con-cerned I will be a party to no such po-litical hypocrisy.Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-sent that I may resume my remarkswhen the Senate resumes considerationof this proposal on Monday and that it becounted as part of this speech.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is thereobjection? The Chair hears none, and itis so ordered.Mr. WILLIAMS ofDelaware. Mr.President, I promised to yield to the Sen-ator from Illinois before. I forgot to dothat. I shall yield to him and then yieldthe floor.Mr. PERCY. Mr. President, I have onequestion of the Senator from Delaware.My own support for the Nixon familyassistance plan has been based primarilyon the fact that there is built into thesystem an incentive to work.As I understand the Senator fromDelaware, he has come to the conclu-sion that there is a disincentive to workthat is greater than in the existing wel-fare plans. If that is true, I am deeplydisturbed by the analysis he has made.As I have understood it, the bill hasbuilt-in financial incentives to work thatare greater than Under the existing wel-fare. But it does not rely solely on finan-cial incentives. It has certain other in-centives and requirements that are partof the plan.My belief that these will work is basedupon the fact that in fllinois for 5 yearsnow we have had a requirement that aman who is a welfare recipient get train-ing. That has caused about 50,000 peoplewho were on welfare to have gainful em-ployment as a result of these require-ments.My understanding is that the familyassistance plan proposed by the adminis-tration does require registration for worktraining or vocational rehabilitation asa precondition to receiving payments;that it has a proved provision for directreferral to jobs, that it has expandedtraining opportunities, a requirement toaccept suitable work or training, and anexpandedchildcare program whichwould free mothers for work who other-wise are tied down, and enhance develop-ment of the child at the same time.Lastly, it provides aid to the workingpoor in removing the incentive to quitwork for welfare. Those are all provi-sions built into the plan.I cannot see why there is more a dis-incentive to work under the plan thanunder welfare, where many of the pro-visions I mention do not now exist.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I refer tothe report to the committee of Novem-ber 5, page A\u201425, and use the examplefor Chicago, Ill. Under the present lawthere are incentives to work. This isan example of a four-member familyheaded by a woman and refers to thenet retained of each earned dollar. Underthe present law when that woman goesout and works, with her child in a daycare center, she can keep 54 cents fromeach earned dollar. Under this bill, theadministration proposal, she keeps only27 cents, which is one-half as much asunder the present law. My point is thatthe incentive is cut in half. I think weneed more incentive than there is underthe present law. I want an incentive inthe law where these people will be phasedout of welfare.In Arizona under the present law aperson that trains himself and wantsto go out and get a job gets to keep 62cents out of the dollar, but if this billbecomes law he would keep 28 cents,which is a disincentive, compared withthe present law.In my State they would keep 71 centstoday from what they earn when they geta job compared with only 23 cents of thatdollar under this bill. There is not thesame incentive.In New York the cut is from 60 to 30cents.I agree with everything the Senatorhas said about the need for welfare re-form, but the Senator has spoken on thebasis of the analysis of this bill as theyhave been describing it downtown. I havesaid I endorsed the President's recom-mendation and still endorse what heseeks to achieve. I will support a bill to-morrow if we can get a bill with amathematical formula to achieve what heseeks, but this bill goes in the oppositedirection. The problem we have is thatwhen these figures and different systemsare related to each other there is not anincreased work incentive, as they say, butthere is an increase in incentive not towork.For the four States that were selectedwe took two large States, Illinois andNew York, and two small States, Arizonaand Delaware, as examples. If a persongets $6,000 in Illinois after taxes he has$6,001,including the housing bonus.That is all the family would have left.If that same person earns only $1,000she has total cash in welfare paymentsandbenefitsinkind\u2014foodstamps, and so forth\u2014equaling $6,197. That is December 19, 1970 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATE S 20817$196 less than If she earned $6,000. Thatis not an incentive.The Senator knows If you want an em-ployee to have incentive you give hima raise. It is something to work for.Take the State of New York. If the per-son is making $7,000, he has after taxes$6,209 in spendable income, but if hegets an increase up to $8,000\u2014and everybona fide worker should tryto earn more\u2014he gets a net increase of $572 forthat work. But suppose he spits in theboss' eye and gets his salary cut to $6,000.He gets a $1,303 Increase. He has $1,303more by earning less. That is not a workincentive program. I know the Senatorwill agree with me.Take the Senator's State of Illinois andthe person with a $5,000 salary. He hasexpendable income including welfare,rent supplements, and so forth, aftertaxes of $6,867, but if he works harderand makes $6,000, under this bill hewould have $6,001. That does not makesense. If they make $7,000 they have$6,508 or $359 less than if he made $5,000.Can this be called a work incentiveprogram. The only incentive to workunder this bill Isto work to get onwelfare.Those are the points I say need to becorrected. This person earning $,000should be encouraged to train to do abetter job, get a promotion, and moveforward. The entire system of our coun-try is that a man can start from anylevel in life and by adapting himself andlearning his trade, increase his earningcapacity so that he can better providefor his family. But a situation is createdunder this bill where a man who wantsto provide for his family cannot afford totake a $1,000 increase in salary withoutlosing $800 for his family. He is put In aposition where he has no incentive toimprove his earning capacity. I do notthink the Senator from Illinois wouldsupport a bill that would do that. Surelythat can be corrected.I have said repeatedly, and I know theSenator from Illinois with his back-ground and experience In business willagree, that there is no problem that canbe put together mathematically thatcannot be solved mathematically if onesits down with the will to do it. There isno doubt in my mind that these notchescan be removed. I know they can be re-moved. But a mathematical quirk orproblem cannot be corrected unless firstone admits and recognizesthat theproblem exists.Our problem has been with the Depart-ment. They are living in the clouds. Theyare out busily making speeches aboutwhat they want to achieve. I could takePresident Nixon's speech that he madeendorsing this plan, and I could standon the floor of the Senate and use it asan argument against this bill.I am wholeheartedly in support of his objec-tives. The Senator from flllnois andother Senators support that objective. Mypoint Is that the bill before us does notdo it. These are not my figures on thecharts. I am not up here speaking frommy analysis alone. That is the reason Iwanted to take the time of the Senateto outline just what Is wrong with thisbill.These charts I am using were not pre-pared in my office. I insisted that theDepartment of Health, Education, andWelfare prepare these charts and submitthem to the committee with the nameof Health, Education, and Welfare onthem so that when I presented them tothe Senate they would not say, \"Well,JORN WILLIAMS has gone nuts. It is in-conceivable and it is hard to believe thatthese notches are here in this bill.\" Theseare the reasons our committee by anoverwhelming vote voted not to reportthe bill. I think it is too bad for the Sen-ate to accept when the Senate under-stands what Is involved. I am not talk-ing about a filibuster. The Senate knowsI have repeatedly tried to limit debate inthis instance I want the Senate to knowwhat is involved before it votes, but thento vote. I want the Senate to work Itswill, but I would not want to see theSenate approve a plan that could onlyexpand the extravagance of our presentwelfare system.Let us not forget the taxpayers andwage earners who pay for this welfare.That is the reason why I personallythink the best course for this session ofCongress would be as follows: I thinkthe President and those who support thisproposal would be well advised to pro-ceed cautiously. I think the Senatorfrom Connecticut would endorse thispoint. I am going to make the suggestionthat this proposal be laid aside withoutprejudice and that when Congress comesin at the next session it take the time totry to work out a solution and do itwithout the administrations chargingnegligence on the part of the majorityparty or the minority party. We are notgoing anywhere if we try to turn thisinto political arguments. The question ofwhether itis a Democratic Congresswhich refuses to pass it or a RepublicanCongress which blocks it is immaterial.The question is,Is it good legislationwhich should be passed?There is no man who respects thePresident more than I do. I supportedhim long before the convention. I expectto be supporting him long after this billis gone and, I hope, forgotten. There isno question about that.I think it is wrong to hold out the falsehope that this Is a welfare reform bill. Itis not. I think it would be bad for Sena-tors to go back to their States and say,\"We in the Senate passed a program thatis going to help you as a welfare recipient,we have passed a program that will en-courage them to get off relief,\" when atthe same time in the Senator's State, in-stead of getting 54 cents of every dollarthey earn they will keep only 27 centsunder this bill and in my State, insteadof keeping 71 cents, they will get only 23cents.Can that be called an incentive.Those people cannot understand thosemathematics. They cannot look behindthe formula. All they can do is look at thespeeches being made, but those speechesdo not solve the problem of illegitimacyor the problem of improving our welfarelaws.I repeat again, no welfare recipient willlose money as a result of this bill. Onemay then ask the question: \"Why not, Ifyou say he will get 27 cents instead of 54cents from each dollar?\"He gets the difference In more welfare.Yet the dignity of that 54 cents asearning income is far better than 54cents on a welfare check. That is thedifference in my belief.I think what we need is a reform billthat will remove these notches, a reformbill that will provide a bona fide workincentive so that a man on welfare will beable to see that the man who gets off wel-fare and enters the labor force benefits,so that the man who stays on welfare willbe able to see that the neighbor who gotoff welfare and joined the labor force isgradually improving the standard of liv-ing ofhis family and getting someluxuries.If we have a welfare program in whichone welfare recipient sits at home andone enters the labor force, but the manwho stays home ends up with more bene-fits, more cash, more luxuries, than theman who went to work, that is the directopposite of what we want to achieve.That will not reduce our welfare rolls.I do not think theadministrationwants that result, but the Senator knowsthat in putting a mathematical formulatogether, with six components whichthey were not taking into considerationat the same time, a number of negativefactors can come into operation.One of the points that was overlookedIn these notches is the fact that whena man works and earns a certain amounthe pays a tax on those earnings. If hestays on welfare and gets the sameamount he does not.Another notch is that at certain levels,when he enters the labor force he has topay hospital insurance for his familyand is not eligible to receive free medic-aid. That also creates a notch.Another notch comes when he gets$600 or $800 for food stamps, and thenwhen he makes $1 over a certain amounthe gets no food stamps. That makes a$500 or $600 notch.These notch's have to be put on paperand recognized.I was somewhat shocked when a de-partment official before our committeeadmitted that prior to making any suchsuggestion with reference to all of theseprograms in which a welfare recipientmay participate\u2014and itis mandatorythat in the Senator's State and my Statethey must become eligible\u2014they did notput them together to see what the resultwould be or how they would be affected.All they did was to look at the first threelines.If we look at just the first three linesand stop there it is a true work incentiveprogram. There is no question about that.But It does not stop there, and theseother programs are in the law. They aremandatory payments. I was shocked bythat negligence on the part of a depart-ment for which we appropriate hundredsof millions of dollars, with all their ex-perts, not figuring these together. Thatis the reason why I said earlier thereis no excuse for It and that what we needIs a good house cleaning In this agencyof Government.Perhaps If some of these people hadbeen In what I will refer to as the labor S 20818 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEDecember 19, 1970force and had had to work for a living,they would be more understanding. In-stead they are living off the taxpayersand just dreaming up ways of how tospend the taxpayers' money with no ideaof where the money would come from.There is nothing more dangerous to so-ciety than an egotistical bureaucrat, andthis agency is full of them. It has gottento the point that it has affected themso that they cannot reason clearly.All we need to solve this problem issome good commonrense. These are some of the mathematics involved in thisbill before us. I do not think any Sen-ator here could get up on any platformin any State, before any audience, andexplain and defend this plan if theyshowed it to the people and explainedhow it would work. I do not care if itwould be in the poorer sections or therichest of an area. I do not think hewould be able to convince anyone thatwe should have a welfare program inwhich the persoh who works will get lessthan the man who stays on welfare.They do not want that kind nf pro-gram. Not one single Senatcr will endorsethat kind of program.My question then is, Why vote for it atthis time? Why not recognize that thisbill should not become the law? Why notlay it aside? We know it is not going tobecome law at this session anyway. Whynot strip the bill down to the first twotitles, which deal with s'cial securityand medicaid reform? Why not strikeout titles III, IV, and V strike out thepending amendment on trade, strike outthe pending Scott amendment, strike outthe Ribicoff amendment, and have a gen-tleman's agreement that neither thetrade amendment nor the fami'y assist-ance plan nor the guaranteed annualwage will be offered in this bill? Why notsay that they are going to be put overinto the next session, and then dispose ofthe medicaid sections and the social se-curity sections, and send it to conference?I say that as one who is not going toblock a vote on this question, if 3enatorswant to have one. But I will regret, andI will leave the Senate somewhat dis-illusioned, if the Senate passes there pro-visions by roilcall votes, and then per-haps following that votes fora10- percentincrease in social security bene-fits and a $100 minimum, knowing at thesame time that this bill Is not going tobecome law.Right now, on Christmas Eve, I thinkthat would just be the cruelest politicalhoax this Senate could perpetrate on theaged. I hope the Senate will not dc it.If we strike from the bill titles III, IV,and V, strip the bill at the same timeof amendments which are pending andwhichare nongermane\u2014the Ribicoffamendment on welfare and the tradeamendment\u2014and have a gentlemen'sagreement that we are not going to pur-sue them in this session of Congress,whether we are for them or against them,and do the business of this Congress,then I think we will be well advised togo home.This Congress has done enough to thetaxpayers arid the sooner it adjourns thebetter for our country.Let the administration appoint a com-mittee from the Finance Committee, theWays and Means Committee, and otherinterested parties and try to come upwith a plan that will work mathemati-cally and not have these quirks in it.It can be done. Let them come up herewith such a plan, present it to Congress,and if it is a reasonable plan, one thathas a true work incentive to carry outwhat the Senator from Illinois wants,what the President wants, and what ev-ery one says he is for, I am confidentCongress will pass it.But if they cannot come up with sucha plan, let us not put one on the books,that we know will not work.Mr. President, I have gone beyond mytime. In line with the previous request,I yield the floor.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, looking for-ward to the time when it might be inorder to consider the various alternativesthat might be suggested in order to ex-pedite consideration of this bill, and inorder to facilitate the consideration ofit by Senators, I am going to ask thatthe bill be printed with each committeeamendment numbered.In that way, Senators can notify meor other members of the committee whichamendments, if any, they consider con-troversial to the extent that they wouldnot be willing to agree to a limitation ofdebate on those amendments, and wecould take that into consideration withregard to any motions to limit debate orto recommit with instructions, or any ofthe various procedural motions thatmight be available to the managers ofthe bill.Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-sent that the bill be printed with theamendments numbered.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is thereobjection? The Chair hears none, andit is so ordered.Mr. MONDALE. Mr. President, I wouldjust like to take a few moments of theSenate's time to report that I have beenreliably advised that the negotiations be-tween the Japanese Government and ourGovernment over textile quotas were onthe verge of a successful agreement, butbefore that was announced, a decisionwas made by the U.S. Government toback off from our proposal.This is a report that comes from an in-direct source, but it comes from a sourcethat at least seems to me to be reliable,and I think it is terribly important, be-fore we act on any trade legislationwhich has been predicated on the theorythat it was necessary to force some kindof agreement, to find out whether in tactour negotiators were on the verge of atextileagreement, and whether thatcould now be quickly put into effect, andwould nullify the need for any furtherconsideration of the proposed textile re-strictions.I am further advised that the textileindustry, when advised of our proposal,Involved themselves quickly to encourageour Government to back off from anyagreement. That would certainly be astrange change of strategy, because allalong we have been told that if only theJapanese would agree to some kind ofvoluntary restrictions In the manmadeand woolens field, as they had alreadyagreed in the cotton field, it would not benecessary to proceed with formal statu-tory quotas.Apparentlyoncethathadbeen achieved or nearly achieved, if my in-formation is correct, the textile industryin this country changed its mind andurged our Government to back awayfrom its proposal and from the imminentagreement. For what reasons I am nottold, but one of them might be that theywere aware that the Senate was con-sidering formal statutory textile importquotas, and felt that they could do farbetter with such statutory restrictionsthan they could with the kind of anagreement which I had understood theyhad sought and which I have now beenadvised was near a successful culmina-tion.Mr. ERVIN. Mr. President, will theSenator yield for a question?Mr. MONDALE. I would first like toconclude my statement.I think that this information, whichhas, as I say, been relayed through in-formal sources, ought to be the basis foran inquiry, and I shall make such aninquiry to our Government, to deter-mine whether an agreement has beenreached, how close to an agreement weare if it has not been reached, and theextent to which itis possible to nowconclude that the informal understand-ing that had been sought is now withinreach, and that, therefore, to proceedfurther with statutory proposals for im-port quotas becomes unnecessary.I am glad to yield to the Senator fromNorth Carolina.Mr. ERVIN. Would the Senator mindrevealing to the Senate the source of thisinformation?Mr. MONDALE. I am not at libertyto do so. I do say I received it from asource I regard to be reliable. But in anyevent, I am sure our Government couldquickly advise us of the facts.I thought this disclosure was of suf-ficient urgency, in the light of the pend-ing legislation, that it should be madepublic, and that we should find out fromour Government precisely what the sit-uation is.Mr. ERVIN. Is the Senator unwillingto disclose the source of his information,so that some of the rest of us might beenabled to ponder whether it is reliableor not?Mr. MONDALE. Well, I would only sayto the Senator from North Carolina thatthe source, which asked not to be dis-closed, is known to me as being very re-liable. But in any event, we can quicklyhear from the administration if theywish to disclose what those facts are re-garding our latest proposal to the Japa-nese and one degree to which we backedoff from this proposal upon pressure fromthe textile Industry.Mr. ERVIN. Well, I would say to theSenator from Minnesota that, while notundertaking to dictate conduct on thepart of other Senators, the Senator fromNorth Carolina would never convey tothe Senate publicly information fromsomebody who was unwilling to allow hisidentity to be disclosed.Mr. MONDALE. I say to the Senatorfrom North Carolina that if this infor-mation which I have received from whalI regard to be a reliable source is accu- December .19, 1970 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATE S 20819rate, and Congress is not being advised ofthis important step, it is a very, veryserious matter, which undermines theIntegrity of -the legislative process, andI considered it to be of sufficiently seri-ous import to raise this matter at thistime, hoping for a prompt answer fromthe administration.Several Senators addressed the Chair.Mr. ERVIN. In other words, the Sen-ator did not receive this informationfrom Old Nicodemus, who travels onlyby night?Mr. HANSEN. Mr. President, will theSenator yield?Mr. MONDALE. I am happy to yieldto the Senator from Wyoming.Mr. HANSEN. Mr. President, theseseem to me to be very serious charges. Ithink that for the Senate to proceed onthe assumption that they deserve cred-ence would be a very risky operation. Ican only say to my good friend fromMinnesota, for whom I have the highestregard, that it would seem to me that ifthere is validity to the contentions thathe has disclosed just now to us, we oughtto be entitled to know specifically whathas been revealed by his sources, andthose sources should come forth andidentfy themselves; and until they do, Iwould hope that the Senate would giveno credence to them. It reminds me ofstories that were heard during WorldWar II, when there were all sorts. ofrumors about peace. It took a long timeafter those first rumors were heard be-fore we actually had any peace.I do not mean at all to impugn themessage that has been brought to usby my good friend from Minnesota. ButI say that I think it is important that weknow, first of all,specifically who ismaking such a statement, and then checkout with sources in the administrationthe accuracy of those statements. Afterthese steps have been taken, if they bothdisclose that the statements indeed de-serve credibility and are true, then Iwould say at that time, and only at thattime, Is it proper to lay aside any con-sideration of a bill that has, in the main,the endorsement of this administration,a bill that is supported by a number ofSenators on this floor, as was evidencedby a vote earlier. Until that sort of docu-mentation can be provided the Senate,I would hope that we would give nofurther seriousconsiderationtothe charge.Mr. FANNIN. Mr. President, will theSenator yield?Mr. MONDALE. I would not have saidwhat I just said unless I were convincedthat there was a serious basis for it. Ithink this is one of the problems of try-ing to operate on such sweeping legisla-tion under conditions 1 minute to mid-night before the adjournment of thisCongress, when there is no longer timeto hold hearings to explore such things asthe feasibility of such textile agreementsor other kinds of international under-standings. As I have said, I received thisinformation from a source which I be-lieve to be sufficiently credible.Mr. HANSEN. I have no doubt of that.Mr. MONDALE. I thought it ought tobe raised. If it is wrong, it is wrong, andthe administration can tell us. But I re-ceivedit from a sufficiently crediblesource that I thought It ought to beraised.Mr. FANNIN. Mr. President, will theSenator yield?Mr. MONDALE. I yield.Mr. FANNIN. Would the Senator bewilling to say whether or not he receivedit In writing or whether it was just a con-versation, and why he would consider Itso reliable when we have had rumorsabout rumors coming along on this sub-ject? As the Senator knows, we have hadinformation in the press continuouslyabout these rumors, but they are justrumors.I have been checking very carefullyon this matter, and I certainly have noindication, and in talking with membersof the administration have no indication, -anythinglike this happening. Weknow that just the opposite has been hap-pening so far as the formal reports areconcerned. Is it in writing?Mr. MONDALE. I think that is imma-terial. I can only repeat what I have said.I received it from a source and in a man-ner which I found persuasive.Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, will the Sen-ator yield?Mr. MONDALE. I yield.Mr. DOLE. When the Senator receivedthe information, was any effort made tocheck it with any administration official?Mr. MONDALE. An effort was made tocheck It insofar as I felt I could. As Isaid, I am sufficiently convinced that Itis a credible source, and I thought theannouncement of what I had learnedshould be made at this time.Mr. DOLE. Did the Senator make theannouncement and then check with theadministration?Mr. MONDALE. I have checked as faras I felt I could. I think It is a serious al-legation. The administration could makeits response.Mr. DOLE. With whom did the Sen-ator check?Mr. MONDALE. I will not go beyondwhat I have just said.Mr. DOLE. The Senator cannot evenreveal the source with which he checked?Mr. MONDALE. I have gone as far asI am going to go on that.Mr. GRIFFIN. Mr.-President, will theSenator yield?Mr. MONDALE. I yield.Mr. GRIFFIN. I was busy conferringwith the distinguished Senator from Con-necticut (Mr. RIRIcoFF) and the distin-gished Senator from Delaware at thetime the Senator made his statement, soI did not hear it. But I am told that hesaid that, on some source, he understandsthat an agreement with Japan on tex-tiles has been entered into. Is that cor-rect? -Mr.MONDALE. I have been told thatit either had been entered into or wasat least imminent, and that the textileindustry got word of this, and our ne-gotiators backed away from this allegedlynear-agreement. So either an under-standing has not been disclosed or webacked off from what was on the vergeof an understanding in order to leave usin a position where we would continueto believe that it was futile to anticipateor contemplate that such an agreementwas possible.Mr. GRIFFIN. I should like to add thisinformation to the colloquy. If such anagreement has been arrived at, it musthave been within the last 2 days, whichsurprises me very much, because 2 daysago, acting in the place of the minorityleader, I met with representatives of theJapanese Government In my office. I willhave to check and get the names. Thenames of Japanese officials are difficultto remember and prOnounce. They wererepresentatives of the Embassy, and onewas a distinguished member of the Japa-nese Diet, who came to me to plead withme to see if our Government would notchange its bargaining position, that theywere too far apart and they could notpossibly agree to the severe conditionsthat our Government was insisting uponin the negotiations.So I will have to say that that is verysurprising to me, and I suppose it wouldbe surprisingtotheofficialsof the Japanese Government who apparentlydo not know that such an agreement wasarrived at.Mr. MONDALE. I am told that thisdevelopment occurred within the last2 or 3 days.Mr. ERVIN. Will the Senator fromMinnesota pardon the Senator fromNorth Carolinaifthe Senator fromNorth Carolina would remind the Sena-tor from Minnesota that these negotia-tions have been carried on under theauspices of the Department of Com-merce, and if the Senator from NorthCarolina would further suggest to theSenator from Minnesota that there is atelephone line\u2014many telephone lines\u2014to the Department of Commerce, whichcould have been resorted to In order toascertain the validity of these rumors?Mr. MONDALE. As the Senator fromNorth Carolina may know, these negotia-tions are being conducted under the di-rection of Mr. Peter Flanigan, of theWhite House.Mr. ERVIN. But the Senator knowsthat the Department of Commerce hasworked on them in conjunction. As amatter of fact, the Secretary of Com-merce has personally attempted to getnegotiations underway and has engagedin many of them himself.Mr. MONDALE. It is my understand-ing, and has been for some time, that theprincipal negotiator for the textile agree-ments is Mr. Flanigan, although initiallythe Commerce Department and its Sec-retary were principally Involved, andthat the situation as I describe it is nowessentially correct.Mr. ERVIN. I will ask the Senator fromMinnesota whether he has any reasonto believe that Mr. Flanigan cannot bereached by telephone?Mr. MONDALE. Just permit me to saythat, as I indicated earlier, I have re-ceived this information from a reliablesource. I believe that it is essentially ac-curate. At this moment, with so fewlegislative hours to go, and affecting, asit does, a fundamental issue of nationaltrade policy, I thought it Important tomake this known.Mr. ERVIN. Does the Senator fromMinnesota think they are going to decidenational trade policies on such rumors asthis? S 20820 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEDecember 19, 1970Mr. MONDALE. For example, just afew moments ago it was proposed thatwe agree on a unanimous time agreementon the trade legislation, which could havebeen taken and agreed to without knowl-edge of this occurrence. I think thatwould be a very serious situation.Mr. ERVIN. The Senator from NorthCarolina would be very glad to vote earlyMonday morning on the trade agreementand would makeunanimous-consentrequest to that effect had he any antici-pation that it might be granted.Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, will theSenator yield?Mr. MONDALE. I yield.Mr. STEVENS. What type of agree-ment was contemplated by the report theSenator has\u2014a voluntary agreement onthe part of the Japanese to limit theirexports to this country? I do not quiteunderstand the nature of the agreementthe Senator indicates was about to beentered.Mr. MONDALE. This is at the heartofthe whole controversy suroundingthe need for legislation to impose arbi-trary trade quotas by statute affectingtextiles. The argument has been widelydiscussed that if only the Japanese wouldreach an understanding with our Gov-ernment for some sort of informal re-straint on the importation or the expor-tationof Japanesetextilesintothe United States, an understanding affect-ing manmade and woolen fabrics, suchas that which now has been reached andlong since reached in the cotton textilefield, it might not then be necessary tohave statutory restrictions.The development which I have report-ed earlier would have a fundamentalbearing on whether any action wouldbe needed by Congress by way of stat-utory restrictions on textile quotas.Mr. STEVENS. IfI may interruptthere\u2014Mr. MONDALE. Because we are withinminute or hours or days from adjourn-ment of this Congress, because we arebeing presented with proposals for lim-iting debate on the trade bill which Iregard as being one involving revolu-tionary changes in American trade vol-Icy, and because I received the infor-mation I had earlier reported on thesource which I found to be fully credi-ble, I thought It important to make thatdisclosure.Mr. STEVENS. I might say to the Sen-ator that I happen to be one of thosewho voted with him on this matter, buton the other hand, if the Senator's reportis one on a voluntary quota system, whichis what the Japanese Government sawfit to impose on the steel exports about 2years ago and then promptly disregarded,I might seriously have to consider chang-ing my mind. It may be that if the Sen-ator is indicating we should not act inthe Congress on the basis f some unilat-eral representation to the Japanese Gov-ernment, that they are ready now to takeaction and indicate, because the passageof the trade bill is imminent, that theywould be willing to enter into some formof voluntary agreement on their part,that is one thing; but if the Senatoris indicating that our Government andtheirs are about ready to enter into asolemn agreement that would be pre-sented to the Senate for ratification, thatis an entirely different matter. If I hadbeen the Senator, I would have checkedthat out before putting it out to thepublic.Mr. MONDALE. This i not a proposedtreaty which would require our ratifica-tion. This is an informal trade proposalbetween the United States and Japan.My understanding is that the proposalthat was offered either provided the basisof agreement or was immediately in dan-ger of providing the basis of agreementand was an offer by this Government tothe Japanese.Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator.Mr. MONDALE. Mr. President, I yieldthe floor. S 20938 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATE SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENTSOF 1970Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, un-der the usual agreement, I ask unani-mous consent that the Senate now pro-ceed to the consideration of CalendarNo. 1443, HR. 17550.The PRESIDING OFFICER.. The billwill be stated by title.The legislative clerk read as follows:HR. 17550, to amend the Social SecurityAct to provide increases In benefits, to im-prove computation methods, and to raise theearnings base under the old-age, survivors,and disability insurance system, to make im-provements in the medicare, medicaid, andmaternal and child health programs withemphasis upon improvements in the operat-ing effectiveness of such programs, and forother purposes.The Senate resumed the considerationof the bill.December 21, 1970 SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENTSOF 1970The Senate continued with the con-sideration of the bill (HR. 17550) to amend the Social Security Act to provideIncreases in benefits, to improve com-putation methods, and to raise the earn-ings base under the old-age, survivors,and disability Insurance system, to makeimprovements in the medicare, medicaid,and maternal and child health programswith emphasis upon improvements In theoperating effectiveness of such programs,and for other purposes.Mr. CURTIS. Mr. President, a previousorder was entered into which granted tothe distinguished senior Senator fromDelaware (Mr. WILLmMs) the right tothe floor. I ask unanimous consent that December 21, 1970 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATE S 20939prior to the recognition of the Senatorfrom Delaware, notwithstanding thatorder, that I might be recognized andthat later, when the Senator from Dela-ware is recognized, he be recognizedunder the terms of the order as set forthin Saturday's session.The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DOLE). Without objection, it is so or-dered.Mr CURTIS. Mr. President, PresidentNixon is to be commended for his state-ments and his position in favor of welfarereform.For about 2years now and priorthereto, President Nixon has called theattention of the country to our welfareprogram which has grown up over aperiod of some three decades. He haspointed out its problems. He has calledfor a reform of our welfare program.As I have listened to his speeches andread them, I have been impressed by thestatement that he made, over and overagain, that he wanted to give the peoplethe opportunity to transfer from the wel-fare rolls to payrolls.Mr. President, President Nixon, I be-lieve, was speaking for a great manypeople in this country when he pointedout that our welfare program needed acomplete overhauling. That implies thatthere are abuses, that there are prac-tices that have sprung up that are notdesirable. The demand for reform im-plies that some changes should be madefor the benefit of the recipients and forfuture recipients. It also implies that weshould do a better job in spending thepublic's money for welfare.It is not surprising that throughout thelength and breadth of this land, thought-ful people have joined the President in arequest and a demand for welfare reform.As a matter of fact, the committees ofthis Congress for several years have feltthe need for reform of our welfare laws.Some new provisions have been writ-ten. Some of them have worked out theway we expected. Some of them havenot. Some other provisions were workedout in the current bill. There is no oppo-sition to genuine welfare reform.Mr. President, the issue before us isnot welfare reform. The choice that theSenate faces is the acceptance or rejec-tion of the Ribicoff-Bennett amendment.I submit there is not one iota of reformin that amendment. I submit that Itfreezes into the law all of the abusesthat have sprung up over the last 30years. I submit that the amendment isnot drawn to deal with the problems thatthe average citizen would describe asproblems needing attention for welfarereform.I am aware that welfare reform Isdefined differently by different people.Were we to go to a county seat in mynative State of Nebraska and stop afarmer on the street and ask him, \"Doyou favor welfare reform and if so, whatis welfare reform and what would youlike to have changed?\" be would havean answer dealing with some of thechanges he thinks ought to be made inour welfare program.As a taxpayer he perhaps has tried tohire help at times. I think also that heis a humanitarian. He perhaps knowssome families that are on welfare. Hewill have some ideas.Mr. President, If we were to go to someof our colleges and universities and seekout an educator who had specialized inthe field of social sciences and social wel-fare and ask him what welfare reformis, we would get another answer.Mr. President, were we to approachsome of our older citizens who are livingon a very meager amount of money andwho have worked hard all of their livesand ask them what welfare reform isand what they wouldliketohave changed, we would get another answer.It is true that there has not been agree-ment on just what welfare reform means.I think we must all agree, however, itmeans that we put more justice into theprogram. I think it means that if there isan individual who is suffering from mis-fortune, who has had no opportunitiesand his need is desperate, that he shouldbe treated in a humane and a generousway. But, by the same token, I think itmeans that if there is someone who hasnot tried very hard, who is brazen andgreedy and is studying the loopholes tosee how he can get more, that it meansjustice for that person also.Mr. President, I am willing to admitthat the abuses are few in number nu-merically, but there is a grave issue in-volving the abuse of the welfare proce-dure. It is not only the savings in dollarsand cents. It is something else.If a welfare program is improperlydrawn, if individuals who should not beon welfare are on welfare, even thoughthey are few in number, it tends to pol-arize the population, it tends to createan animosity and resentment against therecipients of welfare. That is most un-fair to the unfortunate person who is onwelfare because of no choice of his own.Therefore it is in the interest of the poor,it is in the interest of the unfortunate,that we have welfare reform. That in-cludes the removal from the rolls ofthose few cases that should not be onthere or who are included on the rollsfor an excessive amount because of someloophole in the law.Mr. President, I am willing to say with-out contradiction that there is no basicwelfare reform whatever in the Ribi-coff -Bennett amendment.Mr. TALMADGE. Mr. President, willthe Senator yield at that point?Mr. CURTIS. Mr. President,I am happy to yield to the Senator from Geor-gia and ask unanimous consent that Imay yield to the distinguished Senatorfrom Georgia without losing my right tothe floor and without having my resump-tion count as a second speech.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Withoutobjection, it is so ordered.Mr. TALMADGE. Mr. President, Is itnot a fact that rather than reform theprogram, the Ribicoff-Bennett amend-ment actually compounds the errors ofthe existing programs and extends wel-fare benefits and increases them from 11million citizens to 24 million the firstyear?Mr. CURTIS. The Senator Is correct.Mr. TALMADGE. Is it not a fact, also,that there would be an additional cost atabout $4 billion a year or perhaps more.Mr. CURTIS. That is the first estimate.And if our experience under this pro-posal isanything like the experiencewith medicaid, it may be much morethan that.Mr. TALMADGE. Mr. President, didwe not find that the estimates of theDepartment of Health, Education, andWelfare with respect to medicaid wereexactly 1,000 percent in error?Mr. CURTIS. Mr. President, I thinkthat is an understatement.Mr. TALMADGE. And if that would betrue in this instance and if the estimateswere as wrong with respect to the guar-anteed income bill as they were with re-spect to the medicaid bill, then the costwould be in excess of $40 billion extraa year.Mr. CURTIS. As a matter of fact,amendments have been proposed andprinted to the Ribicoff-Bennett amend-ment that admittedly would raise thecost up to $40 billion to $50 billion. Itis not unrealistic to believe that if thisis ever to become a law, suggestions likethat will be made.Mr. TALMADGE. Is it not true that ifthis amendment were to become law, 12percent of the citizens of the UnitedStates of America would immediatelybecome eligible for welfare?Mr. CURTIS. The Senator is correct.In my own State of Nebraska, 3 percentof the population now draw welfare pay-ments that are financed in part by theFederal Government.Itisestimatedthat should this proposal become law,instead of 3 percent, it will then be 11.8percent or an incerase of almost four-fold.Mr. TALMADGE. I have the figures onthe estimates for Nebraska, if the Sena-tor will permit me to read them.The recipients as of January 1970 inNebraska numbered 43,550.Under the proposed amendment itwould become 167,700 which would be anincrease of 285 percent in 1 year's time.Mr. CURTIS. That is correct. I thankthe distinguished Senator for his con-tribution.Mr. TALMADGE. In my State ofGeorgia, if the Senator will permit meto read the figures there, we have 328,400people on welfare. Under the proposedamendment it would immediately be-come 1,025,500, or an increase of 212 per-cent in the State of Georgia. Accordingto the estimates of the department, 22.5percent of the people of my State wouldimmediately become eligible for welfare.But is it not true that some States' eligi-bility would be as high as 35 percent?Mr. CURTIS. The Senator is correct.Mr. TALMADGE. Does the Senatorbelieve it is in the national interest tohave 12 percent of the American peopleon public welfare and in some States ashigh as 35 percent?Mr. CURTIS. I do not believe it is. Todo so would constitute a disservice to thepoor of the country. Right now, becauseof abuses, and through no fault of thepoor\u2014the honest poor, and that includesmost of them, the vast majority ofthem\u2014there is a polarization, there is aresentment, and there is a criticism of it,and if we adopt a program that increasesthe rolls by great numbers it is going to S 20940 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD SENATEDecember 21, 1970create a public sentiment in this countrythat would make it difficult for the peo-ple on welfare and it would make it diffi-cult for the children who are attendingschool. It may cause a wave of publicsentiment that would end up in somelaws that might be a bit harsh.Mr. TALMADGE. Is it not true thatat present many honorable, hard-work-ing, and God-fearing people, through nofault of their own, are earning low wages,and they 'see other families on welfarenot doing any work whatever, where thatperson on welfare may be able-bodiedand could but will not work. Does notthat create a great deal of dissatisfac-tion among the American people at thepresent time?Mr. CURTIS. The Senator is correct.If that number that may become recipi-ents is Increased, by the same token therewill be an increase in the number of caseswhere there might be a serious question.Mr. TALMADGE. I thank the Senatorfor yielding.Mr. CURTIS. I thank the Senator forhis contribution.Mr. President, it would be my hope thatevery Senator in the Chamber would readfour lines of this bill. I call attention tothe very first section in the bill, page 4,entitled \"Declaration of Goal.\" Listen tothe language:The Congress hereby establishes a nationalgoal of assuring all citizens, through work orassistance, In this decade, an income ade-quate to sustain a decent level of life and toeliminate poverty among our people.There is not one word In there aboutwelfare reform. There is not the slightestsuggestion that this proposal is intendedto bring about any reform. There is notthe slightest suggestion In that languagethat there Is anything wrong with ourwelfare program.It is a declaration for a national mini-mum Income. Probably many people inand out of Congress support that goal. Isay to them, \"Let us debate that on itsmerits, but do not bring it in under theguise of welfare reform when there is nowelfare reform provision in it.\"The country has been aroused in favorof welfare reform. They have agreed withthe President when he has urged that wehave a program that will lead to payrollsInstead of welfare rolls.I contend that that great body of publicsentiment that has hoped for welfare re-form should not be deceived and anotherproposal enacted which deals with some-thing else. - Mr.HANSEN. Mr. President, will theSenator yield at this point?Mr. CURTIS. I am happy to yield. Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent thatI might yield to the distinguished Sena-tor from Wyoming, without losing myright to the floor and without my subse-quent remarks being counted as a sec-ond speech.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Withoutobjection, It Is so ordered.Mr. HANSEN. Mr. President, I wishto compliment the distinguished Sena-tor from Nebraska for the contributionhe Is making toward a better under-standing of this bill and what we mightexpect will be accomplished by it, wherehope Is held out and promises made forgoals and objectives that seem very farremoved from the act accomplished.One of the concerns of the Committeeon Finance as they undertook an ex-amination of the legislation was whatmight be done in order to encourageable-bodied people, people who had nophysical or mental impairment, peoplewho did not have the burden of the re-sponsibility of young children, to acceptemployment offered them\u2014how we couldtake this big group and insure that thisnew law would put them to work if workwere indeed offered to them. -AsI recall, the House proposed inHR. 16811 that a person who was quali-fied in every respect and who was offereda job and refused to take such a job, orwho failed to register for a training pro-gram, would be penalized $300.I wish to ask the Senator from Ne-braska if that Is correct.Mr. CURTIS. I assume it is. I am notsure; but I assume it is.Mr. HANSEN. I think that under theOctober revised revision the administra-tion proposed that that penalty be in-creased from $300 to $500. I believe thetestimony that was developed duringhearings on the bill showed that a $500reduction in family assistance would ac-tually result in a reduction of only $241in family income since benefits' underother kinds of welfare-type programs in-crease as family income decreases.Does that square with the Senator'srecollection?Mr. CURTIS. That is my recollection.Yes.Mr. HANSEN. I think it Is importantto note what the net effect of this penaltywould be because as I recall earlier inthe hearings when representatives of theDepartment of Health, Education, andWelfare were testifying it was developedand brought out that under the old WINprogram\u2014the work incentive program\u2014some 8,100 persons having been screenedin every respect, were certified by theDepartment of Labor to Health, Educa-tion, and Welfare with a recommendationthat they be required either to take ajob which had In each case been offeredto them or to face termination of thesupport that they were receiving fromwelfare.As I further recall, of this number ofsome 8,100 persons referred by the De-partment of Labor to Health, Education,and Welfare, only 200 were actuallyterminated from the rolls.Does the Senator recall if that wasessentially the situation brought out inthat testimony?Mr. CURTIS. That Is essentially whatthe Senator from Nebraska recalls.Mr. HANSEN. I think It should benoted, as was brought out In the hear-ings before the Finance Committee re-peatedly, and I know the distinguishedchairman of the committee probed hardon this point, that we were trying tofind out what new steps, what new laws,If any, might be in the minds of theadministration, In order better to assurethat this very miserable record might beImproved upon.Does the Senator from Nebraska recallthat the administration's representativeswere able to come forward with any spe-cific plan or new law that they felt wouldmarkedly change this situation?Mr. CURTIS. I believe that an ex-amination of the existing law, and thefacts in this case will reveal, that thereisnothingintheRibicoff-Bennettamendment that in any way strengthensthe work requirement provisions of thelaw.As a matter of fact, in a moment ortwo I expect to refer to some facts thatindicate clearly that the work require-ment provision of the Ribicoff-Bennettamendment is weaker than existing law.Mr. HANSEN. The Senator from Wyo-ming will be very interested in the Sen-ator's presentation as he goes into thosefacts.Mr. CURTIS. Mr. President, I want torepeat my admirationforPresidentNixon in arousing the country to theneed for welfare reform. I am thoroughlyconvinced, after listening to months ofhearings, that the technicians who tookover to translate the President's statedobjective into legislative language havemiserably failed the President of theUnited States.I want to say something about thework requirement.Present law requires that an appro-priatewelfarerecipient must accept\"employment in which he is able to en-gage\" subject to ultimate loss of his wel-fare payment. Under amendment 1097,a welfare recipient would face loss ofwelfare only if he refused to accept \"suit-able\" employment.A big difference.For instance, amendment No. 109'? would require that in addition to physi-cal fitness for the work, evaluation of ajob's \"suitability\" take into account awelfare recipient's \"prior training andexperience, his prior earnings, the lengthof his unemployment, his prospects forobtaining work based on his potentialand the availability of training oppor-tunities, and the distance of availablework from his residence.\"In other words, what is suitable em-ployment? To answer that question, wehave to take into account his prior earn-ings. So if someone has been earninghigh wages or a high salary and he be-comes a welfare recipient, one of the fac-tors in determining whether or not heshould take a job, if a job Is suitable, isthatit has some resemblance to hisprior earnings.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, willthe Senator yield at that point?Mr. CURTIS. I am happy to yield tomy distinguished chairman, and I askunanimous consent that I may do sowithout losing my right to the floor andwith the understanding that it shall notcount as an extra speech on my part.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Withoutobjection, It is so ordered.Mr. LONG. I would submit that thenext item the Senator is coming to wouldoffer an even better opportunity for aperson to refuse to go to work, becauseIt would require that his prior experiencebe taken into consideration in determin-ing whether work was suitable. Thiswould mean that a man could refuse togo to work either because he had notraining or experience for the job he is December 21, 1970 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATE S 20941offered or because he had experiencedoing something else. He could refuse togo to work on either ground, either be-cause he had no experience in the typeof work offered or he could decline totake the job because he thought he wasqualified to do something else that wouldpay him more:I am sure the Senator intends to pointout further in his statement that theamendment as it is proposed here wouldprovide that a job was unsuitable unlessit paid the prevailing wage rate. I canunderstand how we might insist thatsomeone get the prevailing wage as acondition to going to work if he hasearned the right to draw benefits underunemployment insurance. But when weare talking about a person who has notdone any work before and knows noth-ing about the kind of work required for aparticular job, that is something else.Let us take the situation of a personwho is offered a job as a domestic. If thatperson has not done any work, even do-mestic work, is it not asking too muchthat the person be paid the prevailingwage rate of someone who has had ex-perience in doing the work and has areputation for honesty and for not pick-ing up everything that is not nailed downand for not prying loose everythingthat is nailed down in that household?When one combines all the conditionsspelled out In the amendment in orderfor a job to be considered suitable, aperson has every way under the sun toavoid taking a job on the grounds thatIt is unsuitable.As if that was not bad enough, we havethe record referred to by the Senatorfrom Wyoming, where, out of 8,100 per-Sons who refused without good cause toparticipate In a work program, only 200,or about 3 percent. were actually takenoff welfare, because of their refusal totake work.With all these other conditions of jobsuitability, it Is clear that the only per-son who will go to work is one personwho voluntarily wants to go to work.The provision we are talking aboutdoes not relate to other benefits that areavailable from other Federal and Statesources, or the fact that a person mightbe getting income that we do not knowabout, such as income from illicit con-duct, Income from criminal conduct.This is a pretty big Idea nowadays, withthefts running about 3 percent of thegross operations of the average depart-ment store and with the big problem wehave In dope today. It Is very difficult tosee how one in any seriousness could ex-pect that th1 work requirement meansanything whatever.Mr. CURTIS. My distinguished chair-man is correct. I think the languageclearly points out that the work require-ment provisions of the Riblcoff-Bennettamendment are weaker than existinglaw.In speaking of abuses in the welfareprogram, I do not think we can repeattoo often the fact that the vast majorityof our welfare recipients are honest peo-ple. They are' good people. They long forsomething better. But whenever we per-mit abuses, we are treating those con-scientious people unfairly, because theabuses will stand out in the public mind,and will constitute a stigma upon theunfortunate people who are anxious to dothe very best they can for themselves, butstill find it necessary to be on welfare.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, will the Sen-ator yield for a question?Mr. CURTIS. I am happy to yield.Mr. LONG. Is it not correct that bypermitting the kinds of abuses to whichthe Senator is directing himself, we tendto discourage, demoralize, and disillu-sion those honorable people who are try-ing to earn their own way, and who applyfor welfare assistance only because theyhave no choice about the matter?Mr. CURTIS. That is correct.I continue, now, about the work re-quirementinthisRibicoff-Bennettamendment.Amendment No. 1097 would define as'unsuitable\" any job that pays less than$1.20 per hour.Mr. President, I would like to see everyperson earn just as much money as hecan, and as much as the traffic will bear.But what are we going to do if there isa community In the country where laboris being performed for a dollar an hour,or $1.10? I do not say that that situationis desirable, but it exists. If we adopt thisproposal, It will be unlawful for a welfarerecipient to go to work at less than $1.20,even though other individuals situated inthe same community, facing similar cir-cumstances, are working for less thanthat amount.I am willing to admit that welfarereform is defined differently by differentpeople. But can any of us eliminate sim-ple justice as an important ingredientin welfare reform?If the prevailing wage in the areafor the type of work Is more than $1.20,then that becomes the minimum wagefor a welfare recipient. This would betrue even though people in the localitynot on welfare were working on jobs forless than $1.20 which may be the prevail-ing rate for this type of work\u2014and eventhough jobs at these rates may be theonly jobs available in the area.In addition, amendment 1097 wouldset the following order of priority in pro-viding work and training for welfarerecipients who register with the LaborDepartment.First. Unemployed fathers and moth-ers who volunteer;Second. Family members 16 or overnot employed, in school, or in training;Third. Persons already employed fulltime; andFourth. All other persons register\"d.With this order of priority, it is highlyunlikely that any mother would ever berequired to accept employment.Mr. President, I hold In my hand anewspaper clipping bearing the date ofNovember 29, 1970. The heading of thisclipping says, \"$12,000 Families GettingFoot in the ADC Door.\" The subheadquotes the welfare director for DouglasCounty, Nebraska\u2014where Omaha is lo-cated\u2014a Mr. Healey, as saying:Rule sets welfare up for a kill.Thenthe story goes on and tells how,because of a loophole in the law, individ-ualsare drawing welfare under theAFDC program when they do not needIt.It just happens, Mr. President, thatthat story was based upon 10 cases takenfrom the welfare rolls In the State ofNebraska which were selected at my re-quest. I did not request those specificcases, but I asked for 10 cases that illus-trated the problem; and I think it is im-portant that we observe what the prob-lem is, and then consider it in the light ofthe Ribicoff-Ben.nett amendment.I turn, for example, to case No. 5. Thisillustrates the need for reform. This casecomes from Sarpy County, Nebr. Thereare two parents and three children. Theyare on AFDC. The gross wages per monththat the man draws amount to $799.85\u2014it lacks 15 cents of being $800 a month.But in order to see if having someoneon welfare and still having him workwould encourage him to work more andget off of welfare, Congress passed someamendments in 1967 which permittedcertain disregarding of income in orderto encourage individuals to work. Thosedisregardings Included his taxes, his so-cial security taxes, his union dues, andhis transportation expenses.So this family, after you disregard allthose expenses, has take home pay of$612.33 a month.Now, when someone applies for wel-fare, the caseworker sits down with them,ascertains what their rent is, their foodneeds, utilities, child care, care of anill person in the home, or whatever it is,and adds that up. In this particular case,the budgetary need of this family was$503.50. The take-home pay was $612.33.They were actually earning $108.83 morethan their budgetary needs. But becauseexisting law permitted them to disregardtheir expenses of working, which in thiscase ran over $187, to disregard $30, andthen to disregard one-third of the restof their earnings, this family was draw-ing welfare of $170 a month.I submit to the Senate: Is that fair tothe rest of the people of the country?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. Pres-ident, will the Senator yield?Mr. CURTIS. I yield.Mr'. WILLIAMS of Delaware. This isone of the same examples, as I under-stand it, that the Senator called to theattention of the Finance Committee, andthe Department admitted that the billwhich is now before the Senate wouldnot correct this situation but would per-petuate it.Mr. CURTIS. That is correct.Mr. President, I want to invite atten-tion to a very startling thing. Whenthese 10 cases were laid before the Fi-nance Committee, there were other factswhich were sent in from other States,particularly California. Our staff haddone some work on it, and an amend-ment was adopted dealing with this loophole. A member of the staff took eachone of the 10 cases I am talking about,applied the new formula to them, and itclosed the loophole. That is in the Fi-nance Committee bill. Do Senators knowwhat will happen if we pass the Ribicoff-Bennett amendment? It will strike thisreform out.There is another provision in the Rib-icoff -Bennett amendmet that not manypeople realize is there, and that is a pro-vision that a present welfare recipient isguaranteed by law that he will not be S 20942 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEDecember 21, 1970taken off the rolls nor will his welfare bereduced.Mr. President, not only does this pro-posal fail to bring about any reform; Itsvery provisions prevent any reform inwelfare law.It is not easy for me to stand here andoppose a proposal instigated by my Pres-ident. I am a partisan. I plead guilty toit. But I say that the President of theUnited States is not to blame. I say thatthe technicians who took over, whetherthey be close to him or in the bureau-cracy, utterly failed the President of theUnited States. They have not come upwith a legislative proposal that woulddeal with the abuses and shortcomings-ofour present welfare law. They have notbrought in a proposal that would do asthe President wants done\u2014have individ-uals go from welfare rolls to payrolls.The President of the United States hasbeen failed miserably.Mr. President, if we adopt the Ribicoff-Bennett amendment, the provision work-ed out to prevent abuses such as I havereferred to is out.The State of Nebraska is not one ofthe most wealthy States. The citizen.sthere have to work hard for their mon-ey. We are not blessed wlLh precious miii-erals, coal or an abundance of oil or anyother great source of wealth. Our peoplework hard and our population is small.But if the Ribicoff-Bennett amendmentprevails, it wil1 eliminate a saving to thatState of $1,800,000 annually. I have re-ceived an estimate that that is what theState would save by the committee's lan-guage which would take care of theseabuses. And if the Senate adopts theRibicoff -Bennett amendment, that Is out.Not only is the language repealed, but,also, as I have said, It contains otherlanguage that guarantees that no wel-fare recipient will be taken from the rollsor have his welfare cut.How on earth can anybody suggestthat that Is welfare reform? Well, theycannot. It just is not.Mr. President, much has been said thatthe adoption of this proposal would savemoney for the States. I suggest that theGovernors and the members of the Statelegislatures take that with a grain of salt.They had better read the bill. It was notsuch a bad idea when the clerk was re-quiredtoreadtheRibicoff -Bennettamendment in total. It was not a badIdea at all. Frankly, I think it should beread some place, and at least should beread by those who advocate It.I am going to say something aboutthe saving provisions in this bifi. Thesavingsprovisioninsection542of amendment 1097 Is designed to replacethe Federal-State matching provisionsapplicable to cash public assistance pro-grams for families with children, and forthe aged, blind, and disabled. Under thissavings clause, States would generally berequired to spend 90 percent of their 1971State costs for welfare payments.That has been repeated over and overagain. The fine print has not been re-pealed. Starting in 1973, this State sharewould be increased each year accordingto a formula based on the ConsumerPrice Index. Thus, for example, if thatindex rises by 5 percent per year, aftera period of 10 years, States would. be re-quired to expend for cash public assist-ance an amount equal to more than 140percent of their costs in 1971. Has anyGovernor been told of that possibility?Oh, he was told only about the 90 per-cent provision.I contend that perhaps the Presidentof the United States is not the only per-son who has been deserted in referenceto this proposition. The individuals re-sponsible for this bill, in my opinion,have been unfair to the President of theUnited States. They have not delivereda proposal that he discussed in the pub-lic forum for months and months, andthey have not delivered a proposal thathas been fully presented to our Gover-nors and the members of the State legis-latures.In addition to the possibility of an in-crease in what the State has to pay inthe cash amounts, there Is somethingelse.In addition, any liberalizations of wel-fare programs which are not requiredby Federal law but result from optionalState action would not be covered bythis savings clause, but would come wi-der the regular matching provision. Thus,if the cost of living increases and a Statedecides to provide its welfare recipientsan increase in assistance to meet the riseIn living costs, the State will have to paytwice: once to meet its share of theIncreased assistance, and once more be-cause the rise In the cost of living willtrigger an Increase In the State's man-datory level of payments subject to thesaving clause.It should also be pointed out that thesavings clause in amendment 1097 coversexpenditures for cash public assistanceonly and not expenditures under relatedprograms which might be expected to in-crease substantially if the amendmentbecame law.Medicaid Is a good example of that. Inmany of the States an individual Is eli-gible for medicaid If he Is recipient ofwelfare. It was pointed out awhile agothat an estimate of the increase of thenumber of welfare recipents in my Stateof Nebraska would be almost fourfold, sothat there would be almost four times asmany people eligible for medicaid, andunder the law they have to treat them allalike, but the medicaid expenditures donot come within this 90 percent savingscost.State expenditures not covered by theamendment include those for adminis-trative costs, the cost of job trainingand referral of welfare recipients, andmedicaidcosts.Theseexpendituresshould increase substantially because ofthe increase in the number of recipients.For example, the State of Oregon hasestimated that under a proposal similarto amendment 1097, the State would inthe 1971\u201473 biennium incur increasedmedicaid costs of $9.9 million, and in-creased employment program costs of$3.7 million. All of these costs would haveto be paid by the State over and abovethe amounts for which it would be re-sponsible under the saving clause.Mr. President, it seems to me that theproponents of this measure should getout some telegrams to the Governors andgive them the full story of what this billwill do to their State budgets. I thinkthey should include in the telegrams thestatement of the declaration of goalsfound on page 4 which does not have theslightest hint of welfare reform.Another feature of the saving clausewhich should be noted is that it providesan absolutely fix\u00e7d State cost for cashpublic assistance programs in a givenyear\u2014if the State does not decide toadopt a more liberal program than Isrequired by Federal law. There would belittle incentive for State officials admin-istering such programs to strive for effec-tive administration since the FederalGovernment and not the budget of thatState agency would have to bear any in-creased costs resulting from administra-tive lapses in such areas as determiningthe proper amount of assistance, pre-venting ineligible individuals from com-ing on the rolls, and promptly removingrecipients from the rolls when they areno longer eligible.Mr. President, while there are newprovisions in this present draft known asthe Ribicoff-Bennett amendment, it isagreed that the basic program Is theprogram that they have advocated allalong.A table has been prepared showing theproportion of the population of federallyaided welfare under present law. In thistable It is referred to as the administra-tion's revision. I do not want to offer itas being Identicalwith the pendingamendment but I do believe it is sub-stantially the same, so far as the figuresare concerned.I ask unanimous consent to have thetable printed in the RECORD.There being no objection, the tablewas ordered to be printed In the RECORD,as follows: December 21, 1970 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATE S 20943TABLE 1.\u2014PROPORTION OF POPULATION ON FEDERALLY AIDED WELFARE UNDER PRESENT LAW AND ADMINISTRATION REVISION Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, will theSenator from Nebraska yield?Mr. CURTIS. I yield.Mr. MILLER. Do I understand cor-rectly that the table which the Senatorjust placed in the RECORD might not bequite applicable to a table similarly pre-pared withrespecttothepending amendment?Mr. CURTIS. My point is that I thinkItissubstantially descriptive of thepending amendment.Mr.MILLER.Iwaswonderingwhether the distinguished manager ofthe amendment, the Senator from Con-necticut (Mr. RIBICOFF) couldtell us whether the table that the Senator fromNebraska has referred to does differ atall from the Impact of the pendingamendment.Mr. CURTIS. I might say, first, that Ihave not had the opportunity to show itto the Senator from Connecticut, but willdo so now.Mr. MILLER. May I say to the Senatorfrom Nebraska that I have assumed, upuntil now, that the amendment beforeus would result in substantially the sameIf not the Identically same results as thetable Which the Senator from Nebraskahas placed in the RECORD.Mr. CURTIS. I think that Is correct.Mr. MILLER. I do not know. That Iswhy I thought perhaps the Senator fromConnecticut, one of the cosponsors of thepending amendment, could tell us.Mr. RIBICOFF. Will the Senator fromNebraska yield?Mr. CURTIS. I yield.Mr. RIBICOFF. I would say that thetable being offered by the Senator fromNebraska is substantially correct. Theremay be a slight variation of a percentagepoint, but for the purpose of the argu-ment that the Senator from Nebraska ismaking, there is a very substantial riseand there would be some variations inthe fact that we are paying, under my amendment, a couple $230 Instead of$210\u2014It might vary it a little bit. Butfor the purposes of the argument that Isbeing made, the tabulation is very sub-stantially similar, the Senator is correct.Mr. CURTIS. Mr. President, I thankthe Senator and I thank my distin-guished friend, the Senator from Iowa.Mr. President, this tabulation shows,for instance, that as of last January,'1.3 percent of. the population of Alabamawere drawing federally financed welfarepayments and that If the program is en-acted into law,this7.3percent willincrease to 19 percent. In the State ofGeorgia, 7.2 percent jaf the population arenow drawing such welfare payments, andif this proposal becomes law, it will thenbe 22.5 percent of the people that will beeligible to draw welfare payments.I have already pointed out that in theState of Nebraska 3 percent of the popu- lation as of last January were drawingfederally financed welfare payments ofsome kind, and that If this proposal wereto become law the number eligible is estimated to be 11.7 percent of the popu- lation. That is an increase of almostfourfold.Last January the number of recipientsin Nebraska were 43,550. This proposal,if It were enacted into law, would make eligible an estimated 167,700.On page 6, it provides for a determi-nation of eligibility and,among otherthings, it says:Such determination shall be made on the basis of the Secretary's estimate of the fam-ily's income for such quarter, and such esti-mate shall in turn be based on income for a preceding period unless he has reason to be-lieve that modifications in income have or are likely to occur on the basis of changes inConditions and circumstances.The Secretary will have to estimate inadvance the income. What will they doabout overpayment.s? I know what willbe done, The conscientious people willrefund overpayments. The others willnot. We will have trouble.Mr. President, there are Senators whosay that the bill does not provide enough.If we adopt the philosophy of this bill I do not know that I am in a position toargue the point. But I think it Is wellthat we determine who would be eligible,even though they are fully employed, forcash benefits if this bill passes.On page 5 we find how much Income a family can have and still be eligible forbenefits.It says it will be $500 per year for eachof the first two members of the family,plus $300 per year for each additionalmember.That amounts to $1,600. If they haveIncome of $1,599 for a family of four,they are eligible. However, there are certain items excluded from income.Mr. WILLIAMS ofDelaware.Mr. President, will the Senator yield?Mr. CURTIS. I will yield in a moment.Mr. President, $720 is excluded. ThenI return to page 9. It provides:Subject to limitations as to amount or otherwise, prescribed by the Secretary, theearned income of each child in the familyWho Is, as determined by the Secretary un- der regulations, a student regularly attend-ing a school, college or university, or a Course of vocational or technical training designedto prepare him for gainful employment;(2) (A) the total unearned income of all members of a family In a calendar quar- terwhich is a small amount.It further provides;(3) An amount of earned income of a member of the family equal to the cost in- curred by such member for child care whichthe Secretary deems necessary to securing or continuingInmanpower training,voca- tional rehabiUtation, employment, or self- employment(4) The first $721) per year of income is excluded.Fifth, food stamps are excluded.Sixth,trainingallowances areex- cludedSeventh, scholarships are excluded.Eighth, home produce is excluded.Ninth, any amounts received for thefoster care of a child living In the same home as the family but not a member of the family.Federally aided welfarerecipients, January 1970CivilianPercentresidentof 000Oregnn 2, 044, 000Pennsylvania 11, 797, 000Rhode Island 886, 000 South Carolina 317, 000 Puerto Rico 2, 763, 000Guam takeninto account.Many of these potential recipients willbe subsidized with respect to housing.They will be living in premises wherethe Government pays part of the rent.That is not included in the test for eligi-bility.They will be eligible in many instances,perhaps all, for free medical care. Thatis not included.Some of them may buy a home underthe 235 program where the payments tocarry their loan might be $180 and theGovernment might pay $100 or half ofIt. All of these subsidies are cash out ofthe Treasury to such families.That is why, when one adds up all thepogsible benefits that in many Instancescan and will be paid, he arrives at thefigures that appear on charts such as thedistinguished Senator from Delawarepresented to the Senate last week, andno doubt more of those charts will bepresented.I yield to the senior Senator fromDelaware.Mr. WILLIAMS ofDelaware.Mr. President, we were speaking a momentago about the Governors' conferenceendorsing this bill. Is it not true that thefive Governors representing the Gover-nors' Conference, when they testified be-fore the committee pointed out that orig-inally the Governors had endorsed thebill based on ,ress releases from Wash-ington describing the purpose of the billand what the bill would achieve, but theysaid that after they read the bill they de-cided it was more or less a monstrosityand should not pass?If the Senator will yield further Iwould like to read the,testimony of Gov-ernor Hearnes In that connection.Mr. CURTIS. I am happy to yield tothe Senator from Delaware.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Therehas been so much misunderstandingabout thismatter. Last Saturday,I stated that when the President outlinedhis work program and said he wantedto reform the welfare system I hailed itas a great step forward. I agree that theNo. 1 Job in the country Is to reform thewelfare system. There has to be reformbut a bonallde reform would not perpe-tuate the abuses.I quote Governor Hearnes' test!-mony before the Finance Committee.Governor Hearnes testified:I would like to make one observation re-garding this bill to the Committee. I makethis observation as the Governor of Missouriand not as Chairman of the National Gov-ernors' Conference, since it is quite possibleI may not reflect the views of some of mygubernatorial colleagues.It occurs to me' that the Am1nistrationhas simply picked a figure out of the air\u2014some $4.1 billion\u2014and, attempts to compresstoo many major and costly reforms into thisfigure. I would suggest that the Committeedelay the adoption of legislation at this timewhich would draw into the welfare systemsome 14 million citizens now in the ranks ofthe working poor or under-employed. I be-lieve the money could be used to better ad-vantage in shoring up other aspecte of thisbill.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEAt another point he said:Granting that attention should be givenlater to the working poor, it seems to methat welfare reform for the benefit of thepresent assistance recipients should be es-tablished and working before adding thisvast new segment of the population to thewelfare system.Finally, the workability of the entire newwelfare program is still to be proved. I agreewith Senator Rxsicos'r's suggestion that thereform measure be thoroughly tested priorto placing it into effect. I understand theHEW is funding experimental projects inSeattle, Washington, and Gary, Indiana, andanother one on a statewide basis in Vermont.Continuing he states:Certainly, we could create staggering dis-order if we would move into a program asvast as that encompassed by HR. 16311,until a thorough trial period has proved itsvalue.With testimony such as that and withsimilar testimony from four of the fiveGovernors along similar lines I thInkCongress would' do well to weigh theadvice of these Governors who have hadexperience in administering this pro-gram.I now quote Governor Hearnes' an-swer to a question by the distinguishedSenator from Idaho (Mr. JORDAN):Senator JORDAN. Governor Hearnes, couldyou tell the how many of your Governorswould vote if they sat up on this side of thetable for the House-passed legislation withfull implementation now?Governor HEARNE5. Well, Senator, I thinkthose who would read the bill would notbe for it in its entirety.As he and other Governors pointed outin their testimony, after they read thebill they saw that it did not achieve thepurpose for which it had been outlined.Congress made a great mistake a fewyears back when it adopted the medicaidprogram proposed by the Departmentof Health, Education, and Welfare onthe premise that It would cost only $238million more than the then existingKerr-Mills bill, which at that time wasaround $350 million to $400 million. To-day we are spending over $4 billion onthat medicaid program.It would be a great disservice to thecountry and to the States to put anentirely new welfare program of this sizeinto effect when we have had no testi-mony or any evidence presented by theDepartment or the administration as tohow It would work.I shall not take the time of the Senatenow to put In the testimony of the otherGovernors. I shall do that when I amspeaking in my own right. But every Sen-ator should read the testimony of theseGovernors who testified before our com-mittee on what they thought of the meas-ure after they read it. These Governorshad endorsed it before they read It, butafter they had read it four out of fivedid not endorse it. The fifth admitted hehad not read It.Mr. CURTIS. I thank the distinguishedSenator. What the Senator has said ishighly Important. Earlier today I pointedout that there were many items that con-stitute costs of welfare for a State thatare not included in the savings clause,whereby the Federal Government guar-December 21, 1970anjees that their expenses will not ex-ceed 90 percent of the base year. Thatrepresentation has, in my opinion, failedto provide the full story to the Governorsand other State officials on what they willface if the Ribicoff-Bennett amendmentIs agreed to.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. The Sen-ator is correct. I talked with some of theGovernors. They recognize and they donot dispute the fact that this measuredoes not provide any reform, as they hadbeen led to believe they would get. Butmost of them are desperately hopingthey can unload the cost of the existingprograms on the Federal Government.They are buying this measure on thepromise that itwill solve their Statebudgetary problem.The misunderstanding that developsfrom the administration's promise thatthe increased costs of adults over 65, theblind, and the disabled will not exceed90 percent of their costs for calendaryear 1970.On that basis it means that the costsof that particular program wIB not ex-ceed 90 percent of last year's cost, andthat they will save 10 percent. But thatis only a small fraction of the total pro-gram. Federal cost in all welfare pro-grams, medicaid, food stamps, and soforth, was $6,200,574,000. That is thefigure for calendar year 1969. For theStates the annual cost was $4,260,128,000,and for local governments it was an ad-d.itional$1,284,779,000, for a total ofabout $11.5 billion.Now, the welfare cost of the programfor adults, the blind, and the disabled isabout 20 percent of that total annualcost. The States will save 10 percent onthis 20 percent, which means they save2 percent of the overall annual costs. The10 percent savings Is on only 20 percentof the total cost. States would not getthat windfall, as many Governors thinkthey will.Furthermore, nothingis being saidabout who pays for the 14 million welfarerecipients that will be added to the rolls.Mr. CURTIS. I thank the Senator. Imentioned a provision that Increasedcosts by reason of inflation, the rise Inthe consumer index, must be borne bythe State. If the index goes up 5 percenta year at the end of 10 years, the cost in-stead of being 90 percent carried by theState would be 140 percent of the baseperiod.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Yes. An-other point that should not be over-looked is that, regardless of how this billmay be modified or amended to achievetransfer of the cost from the States tothe Federal Government, the ultimatecost of the program is going to be paid bythe same people, the American taxpay-ers. As far as dollars of the Americantaxpayers are concerned, it is immaterialwhether the taxes are levied at the Statelevel and spent at the State level or lev-ied at the Federal level and then sent'ack to the States, perhaps adding to itU cost of a bureaucracy in Washing-ton. So there is not going to be any sav-ing to the taxpayer in transferring thecost from the State to the Federal Gov-ernment. All the cost of the program December 21, 1970 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATE S 2ff945could be transferred to the Federal Gov-ernment and relieve the States and citiesof a lot of money, but the taxpayer wouldnot be saved a dime.Mr. CURTIS. That is correct. I wouldalso like to point out that an expendi-ture by an individual State or an indi-vidual locality does not have a great im-pact on inflation, but centralized ex-penditures in the Federal Governmentunder deficit financing have a tremen-dous impact upon the rate of inflation.Therefore, we are not helping the peopleof the United States, whether they betaxpayers or nontaxpayers, by merelytransferring expenditures from the Stateand local level to the Federal level.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. Pres-ident, if the Senator will yield.Mr. CURTIS. We are taking moneyright out of their paycheck through in-flation.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. But Ithink the main point we should neverlose sight of is that while we are talkingabout reforming the existing welfaresystem, there actually is no reform in thisbill. The Department officials repeatedlytold us that not one welfare recipientwill be getting 1 cent less than he gotthis last year.Mr. CURTIS. And there can be no re-form in those cases where there is anabuse.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. That iscorrect. Those who advocate reform havebeen going around the country callingattention to the glaring examples ofabuse under our existing welfare system.I agree that we need reform, but thepoint is that this bill does not reform it.The only way to reform the welfare lawis by taking away or reducing paymentsto persons who are not entitled to thosepayments. This bill does not correct asingle abuse in the existing program.Mr. CURTIS. The Senator is correct.I would like to call attention to fourlines in the bill, which appear on page28, lines 4 to 7, inclusive. They read asfollows:(1) the provisions of, and the rules andregulations under, sections 442 (a) (2), (c)and (d), 443(a), 444, 445, 446 (to the extentthe Secretary deems appropriate), 447, and448 shall be applied.Mr. President, it is interesting to notewhat that means. That means that theStates' welfare programs must complywith the Federal rules for eligibility. Thatexists even though a State is paying asupplement and is bound to continuethat supplement. It means that the rightto say who is eligible to receive is takenaway from the States. It is placed in Fed-eral hands. The States must comply withit. and if they have been paying a sup-plement, of it they have been payingmore than the Federal share, they areobliged to continue that supplement notonly for the present recipients but forthose who will be added to the rolls un-der rules of eligibility over which theState has no control at all.A while ago I called attention to oneabuse that existed under existing law inthe State of Nebraska, and that, if thecommittee version is adopted, that abusewill be corrected. I want to call attentionto some more cases that fall in that cate-gory.This case involves a mother and twochildren under the ADC program. Themother has gross wages of $455 a month.Under existing law, she is allowed to de-duct the taxes, transportation expense,union dues, and so on, and child care ex-penses. So after all of those disregards,she has an income of $301.43.Under the law and under the rules, anestimate is made as to what her budgetneeds are, taking into account all thenecessary items of expenditure. Thosebudget needs are determined to be $259.She earns $42.43 more than her budgetneeds, excluding the $153.50 that is con-sidered an expense of work.But because of present law, $175 of theincome is presently disregarded, makingher eligible for a welfare payment of$132.57, even though her net earningsexceed her budgetary needs.That is corrected in the committee bill.That language is stricken out If we passthe Ribicoff -Bennett amendment.What is more, if the Ribicoff-Bennettamendment becomes law, there is a pro-vision in it that no recipient shall receiveless than he is drawing now\u2014an abso-lute bar to any welfare reform so far aseliminating abuses is concerned.The case that I have just been talkingabout is not what might be called thecase of a culturally deprived person. Shehas a high school education and is em-ployed as a presser in a cleaning estab-lishment. Yet we are asked to pass a billthat would perpetuate that abuse.Here is another case of a mother andtwo children under ADC. The mother'sgross wages are $565.32. After deductingtaxes, social security taxes, transporta-tion, child care, and union dues, her take-home pay is $361.90. Her budgetary needsare $269. Her earnings exceed her budg-etary needs by $92.90.But because all of the expense of goingto work is disregarded, and $30 is dis-regarded, and one-third of the balance,she is entitled to an ADC payment of$118.87.This individual has had 1 year of col-lege and is employed by a packing com-pany. Her gross wage is $50 a month inexcess of the beginning caseworker inthe welfare program in that country.The committee dealt with these prob-lems and agreed on some language inthe committee bill that would bring re-form in situations like this. The Ribicoff-Bennett amendment strikes out that re-form and carriesa provision whichamounts to the fact that you cannot doanything about it.Let me tell about another case, of amother with two children on AFDC. Hergross wages are $618.15 a month. Thetake-home pay, after subtracting childcare, transportation, taxes, union dues,and social security, is $304.98. Child careis deducted, so she is only being chargedwith $304.98. when her gross wages areactually $618.Her budgetary needs are determinedto be $277. She is earning $27.98 eachmonth more than her budget needs\u2014earning that in counted income, which,because it is under $30, Is disregarded.She draws an AFDC benefit of $140 amonth.This ladyIs employed by WesternElectric Co., and her gross pay exceedsthat of many of the welfare workers whoadminister the program.Here is a case where the gross wagesofthe mother with 5children are$399.10\u2014almost $400 a month. Her take-home pay, after she pays her transporta-tion, is $339.17. Her former husband paysher $130 child support.So after the expense of earnings, shehas an income of $469.17 a month. Herbudgetary need is fixed at $423.50. Thusshe has counted income of $45 a monthover her budgetary needs, but, becauseof the formula for disregardings, shedraws an AFDC payment of $110.70. Shehas a high school education, and workswith a research organization. One of hexdaughters earns approximately $300 amonth during the summer. Because sheis in college, her Income Is disregardedalso.Here is another case: A mother andthree children on AFDC. This motherhas gross wages of $569.22 a month. Hertake-homepay,lesstransportation,amounts to $435.88. Her budgetary needis determined to be $338.35. Thus hertake-home pay amounts to $97.53 morethan her budgetary needs. But, becauseof the formula that calls for disregard-ing certain of her earnings, she draws anAFDC payments of $115.54. The budgetincludes board and room expenses forone child in college.Mr. President, the State of Nebraskahas one of the most generous welfareprograms. I think we are exceeded in theamount that we pay by only one State.The program is carefully administered.People are not put on welfare, ordinarily,unless there Is need. But if they areplaced on the rolls, the State and localunits of government pay an amount thatis adequate.So when the State of Nebraska comesin and points out abuses, and points outsituations where the operation of theprogram is not only unfair to those whopay, but also casts a stigma upon allthose who are on welfare, It is not a mat-ter of penny pinching; it is a matter ofsound government operation.Here is another case: A mother withone preschool child on AFDC has grosswages of $309.05. But her take-homepay, less transportation and other workexpenses,is$202.90.Her budgetarymonthly need Is fixed at $171.34. So hertake-home pay, after disregarding trans-portation and work expenses, Is $31.56more than her budgetary need. But be-cause the law says that the first $30 shallbe disregarded, plus one-third of theearnings thereafter, she draws an AFDCpayment of $94.79. This lady has a highschool education and attended airlinesschool.Here is another case, of a mother andfour children on AFDC. She has grosswages of $115.20. The take-home pay lesstransportation expenses leaves her $96.72but she is receiving child support from aformer husband of $315 a month. So shehas a net income\u2014not a gross income\u2014$411.72 a month. Her budgetary needs areestimated to be $375, so the income in S 20946 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEDecember 21, 1970excess of need, is $36.72. But because $30and one-third of the balance of the earn-ings is disregarded, she is on the rolls.The payment is small, but she is there for$25.01.Mr. President, the existence of suchabuses is a bad thing in any community.It creates discontent. It creates ill will.It puts a stigma not only on adults, buton children. And that is what we werehoping would be cured in a welfare re-form bill. That is what the Committee onFinance worked out, and that is whatwould be stricken from their bill if theRibicoff -Bennett amendment is adopted.All recipients are guaranteed that theywill be kept on the rolls and that theirwelfare will not be diminished.I will cite one more case. This is amother and two children on AFDC. Thegross wages amount to $468. The take-home pay, less child care and transporta-tion, amounts to $253.29. She receiveschild support of $53.33. She has a netincome of $306.62. The budgetary needis estimated to be $287. So her net in-come is $19.62 more than her budgetaryneed. But because the law provides thatcertain income shall be disregarded, shedraws an AFDC payment of $140 a monthand receives food stamps.Mr. President, I am an optimist. Iactually hope that by the time this billis exposed on the Senate floor, just asthe previous proposals failed to get amajority of the votes in the Committeeon Finance, when the features of thisproposal become known, it will be with-drawn by the proponents. It certainlyshould not be adopted and carried alongby the momentum created in the coun-try for welfare reform, because it isnotthat.I again invite attention to the declara-tion of goal, and this is what it says,lines 2 to 5, page 4:The Congress hereby establishes a na-tional goal of assuring all citizens throughWork or assistance in this decade an incomeadequate to sustain a decent level of lifeand to eliminate poverty among our people.I am not going to debate that goal.But I merely point out that that doesnot suggest welfare reform, that thatis another proposition, and the Nationhas been led to believe that we had awelfare reform bill here.Mr. President, one big, central issueIs involved in this controversy: Shall weincrease the number of eligible recipientsfor welfare\u2014the heads of families\u2014bysome 12 million? How would we increasethem? By adopting a new provision thatone can be fully employed and be eligi-ble for welfare. It is argued that thatwill be a good thing, that if someoneworks full time and his income is low,he should be put on welfare; that some-how that will be an inducement for oth-ers, as well as himself, to go from wel-fare rolls to payrolls.In miniature form, that is what Con-gress undertook in the 1967 amend-ments to the welfare law, in a hope that,by letting people work and keep theirmoney, or some of it, and still get awelfare payment, it would be an induce-ment to go out and work more and getoff welfare.Mr. TALMADGE. Mr. President, willthe Senator yield at that point?Mr. CURTIS. I will yield in a moment.The experience in Nebraska, and I amsure in every other State, is the con-trary\u2014that the provision of the 1967 law,permitting people to be employed andthen disregard the first $30 of theirmonthly income and one-third there-after, has led to a situation in which theyare not closing any cases because onecould have his wages and also get wel-fare. Yet, the staff people who took overa sound proposal of the President to re-form welfare latched 'onto the principlethat the way to reform welfare Is to per-mit people to have their wages and wel-fare, also.They should have examined the rec-ord as to what is happening when thatprincipal has been in operation.I yield to the distinguished Senatorfrom Georgia.Mr. TALMADGE. The distinguishedSenator pointed out that this was soldas a work of incentive program, and hestated that, of course, all of us on theFinance Committee know that the veryopposite is true.I hold in my hand page A\u201425 from thedata that the Finance Committee staffdeveloped on this bill:Diminished incentive for low-income workunder administ,ration provisions. For a fam-ily of four headed by a woman, the net valueof each dollar if she moves from unemploy-ment with no income to fuiltime at theminimum wage.We have illustrations cited\u2014Phoe-nix, Ariz.; Wilmington, Chicago,Ill.; New York, N.Y.Under existing law, she would retain62 cents of each dollar she earned. Underthe pending amendment, she would re-tain only 28 cents\u2014less than half underexisting law.In Wilmington, Del., she would retainunder existing law, 71 cents of each dol-lar; undei the administration provision,only 23 cents of each dollar, which isdiminished by almost two-thirds.In Chicago, flI., under existing law, shewould retain 54 cents of each dollar sheearned; under the administration revi-sion, only 27 cents, which is exactly halfof the present law.In New York., N.Y., she would retain,under existing law, 60 cents of eachdollar she earned; whereas, under thepending amendment that would amountto 30 cents.Does the Senator share my view thatthat is work disincentive rather than awork incentive?Mr. CURTIS. correct; it cer-tainly is.Mr. TALMADGE. Would the Senatoryield in order for me to ask unanimousconsent to insert these figures in theRECORD at this point?Mr. CURTIS. I so yield.Mr. TALMAJJGE. Mr. President, I askunanimous consent to have page A\u201425printed at this point In the RECORD.There being no objection, the materialwas ordered to be printed in the RECORD,as follows:DIMINISHEDINCENTIVEFORLOW-INCOMEWORK UNDER ADMINISTRATION ZEVI5IONSFor family of 4 headed by a woman, thenet value of each dollar if she moves fromunemployment with no income to full-timework excluded)Mr. TALMADGE. I thank the Senatorfor yielding, and I compliment him onthe great speech he is making.If the American people realize whatthis bill purports to do, in my judgment,it will be overwhelmingly defeated. TheFinance Committee studied it carefullyin hearing after hearing, and the firstvote got only one out of 17 affirmative.They finally managed to work around toget seven affirmative votes out of 17, andthat is the best they ever obtained in theFinance Committee. Is that not the Sen-ator's recollection?Mr. CURTIS. That is my recollection,yes.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. In con-nection with the points that the Sen-ator from Georgia made about this notbeing a work incentive, I call the atten-tion of the Senator to the fact that tablespresented to the committee and the an-alysis of the bill as It passed the House,which I mentioned the other day theyhave been changed somewhat by a re-vised bill that came back in October, butstill the principles are there. For ex-ample, if a female head of a family offour, had $1,600, with the food stampand other benefits she would get in Statesupplementais,itwouldamountto $3,366; and where that is increased byearnings to $4,180, If she makes $1,000;but if they worked twice as hard andmade overtime, they go down to $3,100 or'$360 less than if left to the one thatmakes a thousand.If that same person works harder andincreases his earnings to $3,000, thatdrops back to $3,766. In other words, themore they earn the less they have. Theylose more than 100 percent of their in-creased earnings. It is not an incentiveto increase earnings. It is quite the op-posite. it is an incentive that if one earnsmoney, he drops back closer to welfarebecause they are more than the earningswould be after taxes.Mr. CURTIS. I thank the distinguishedSenator. It is true that the provisions ofthis measure constitute a disincentive towork.Mr. TALMADGE. If the Senator willyield further on that point, I hold in myhand the hearings before the Committeeon Finance of April 29, 30, and May I,1970. I quote from page 230 thereof, asfollows:Senator TALMADGE. How many people on aidfor dependent children have benefited fromthe earned-income disregard provision and towhat extent have earnings increased as aresult of this provision?Mr. ilAwifiNs. The number is quite sub-stantial. May we submit actual figures on itfor the record?Cents626028716723543827604480 December 21, 1970The proportion of women with some earn-ings within that program is relatively high;maybe the magnitude of a third or some-thing, and I think we can\u2014Senator TALMADGE. Will you submit thefull details for the record, please?Mr. HAWKINS. Yes, sir?Those details have not been submittedto date.That is one illustration of what theFinance Committee had to contend with,time after time. We found in differentareas where delegations were made tothe Department of Health, Education,and Welfare, and we asked time aftertime what action or what decisions theywould make on that delegated power.What it was was the power to write lawand we asked them to submit that for therecord, and they never have. That iswhat we had to contend with in the thear-ings. We asked for the information. Theywould state a conclusion. We would askfor the information to back up that con-clusion, and it has not been submittedas yet. That is the tenor of this wholelegislation. It is a conclusion, some eco-nomic theory, that more people will workif we make welfare more attractive,whereas the figures show the exact oppo-site is true; is that not correct?Mr. CURTIS. That is correct.Mr. President, I have stressed the pointthat the individuals at the staff level,charged with taking over the President'sobjective for welfare reform, and thetechnicians in the bureaucracy, haverendered him a disservice. I believe thatthey have. Some of them have not donetheir homework. When the Finance Com-mittee started holding hearings on theproposal, witness after witness from theGovernment gave as one of the reasonsfor making welfare available to the fullyemployed, that it would stop the breakupof homes, that It would bring an end tothe breakup of family life.Mr. President, every time I was Inthat committee and someone stated that,I challenged them, because it just is notso. The breakup of families in the UnitedStates is due to many causes, not theleast of which is the moral breakdownthroughout the country. But, further-more, their .rgument was several yearslate. It used to be that on aid to depend-ent children, we would pay aid to thehead of the family, usually the mother,If the father was dead or if he was dis-abled, or away from home, and that is all.So there was a father up against it,but If he left or absconded, his familycould get on AFDC. Congress met thatproblem several years ago. It included anadditional category in the AFDC pro-gram. That Is why we call it aid to fam-ilies with dependent children. They pro-vided in the Federal law that the pro-gram was extended not alone to wherethe father was dead, disabled, or absent,but if he was unemployed. Consequently,it Is not necessary, so far as the Federallaw Is concerned, for a jobless person todesert his family In order to get thatfamily on the AFDC program. Also,thefigures show that those States that runtheir program that was-, where unem-ployed fathers can get on an AFDC pro-graIn, the percentage of family breakupswas as high as any other place.The State of New York offers moreassistance to families than any otherState in the Union, yet it leads the Na-tion in family breakups.I hold in my hand an article entitled\"The Crisisin Welfare,\" written byDaniel P. Moynihan, and here is what hesays.It must be remembered that the UnitedStates now has a family allowance for brokenJamilies and that itis widely argued (al-though typically there are not five centsworth of research findings on the subject)that the availability of AFDC payments doeslead to family break up.In other words, Mr. Moynihan saysthere is not 5 cents worth of research tosupport the contention that by payingwelfare to the fplly employed will pre-vent family breakups.Incidentally, I want to read again fromMr. Moynihan. This was in a letter to theWashington Post on Thursday, Novem-ber 25, 1970.I read just part of it:By and large the attacks on the proposalfrom ultraconservatives have been factuallyaccurate.I think they have. I do not know whata ultraconservative is.The statement there that the attackshave been factually accurate is correct.It states further:They understand well enough the basicprinciples of the legislation, and the essen-tial details of its operation, and they op-pose them.This, at least, is a credible position. Onthose points I agree with this distin-guished professor. It is based upon factsthat are accurate. We understand whatis in the bill and we opposed it.Mr. WILLIAMS ofDelaware.Mr. President, will the Senator yield?Mr. CURTIS. I yield.Mr. WILLIAMS ofDelaware.Mr. President, the Senator from Georgia re-ferred to the fact that this did not cor-rect the problem dealing with the familybreaking up. The Senator from Nebraskapointed out that the city of New York,which has the highest welfare rates, alsohas the highest record of split families.We asked the staff when we were analyz-ing the bill to check the revised bill\u2014and I am speaking of the administra-tion's last revised bill In October, as Irecall the date\u2014to see what would hap-pen under this bill If It became law Inthe cases of split faniilies..The following example is given of theIncentive for a family to split up underthe administration bill. This concerns awelfarefamily with an unemployedmother and father with four childrenand no other income.In the city of New York If this familywere to split and the father take twochildren and the mother keep two chil-dren they will increase their combinedincome $2,508 under the bill. They couldget $2,508 premium for splitting thefamily.In Chicago a similar family could col-lect '$2,064 more by splitting the familythan If they were to live In the samefamily unit.In Wilmington, Del., they could get$1,104 more premium by splitting thefamily.S 20947In Phoenix, Ariz., they could receive$936 more.These are bonuses that they could getby splitting and calling themselves twowelfare families rather than a singlefamily unit.I cannot conceive of Congress approv-ing a social program which actually paysthese bonuses to a family to split anddivide the family unit. It is indefensible.It is directly opposite to what we havebeen told it would do.Mr. TALMADGE. Mr. President, wouldthat be considered the antiwedlock provi-sion of the bill?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. It couldbe considered as one of them. I pointedout an example the other day concern-ing a young couple. This example wasprepared by the staff, and I think itshould be used again.Family A consists of a boy 17, a girl 12,and a girl of 6. Family B has a girl 16, aboy 11, and a girl of 8.If this boy and girl decide to get mar-ried each family thereby loses a depend-ency under this bill. They lose a $300Federal bonus, the State supplement, thefood stamps, medical care, and the extrahousing unit they get as a result of theextra dependent.If the young boy and girl get marriedthey are off the welfare rolls since this iscalled aid for dependent children; theyare left out until after the first year oruntil they can produce the first child.However, under the Ribicoff-Bennettamendment if the girl gets pregnant andthe boy does not marry her until afterthe baby is born, the families continueto collect welfare on them as dependents,and they end up with a cash bonus of$1,300. Think of it\u2014the Federal Govern-ment paying $1,300 as an inducementfor them to have this child out of wed-lock.I mentioned this example last week. Icannot conceive of Congress approvinga bill which would pay $1,300 more to acouple that has a child out of wedlockthan they would to the family that hasa child after they are married.As was pointed out a moment ago, afamily of four children receive a pre-miuni of $2,500 if they split the family.That is directly opposite to the objectivesthe President has said he wants toachieve and what theSecretaryof Health, Education, and Welfare has saidhe wants to achieve.We can agree on what they say theywant to achieve; however, this bill doesnot do it. For this reason the bill shouldbe rejected. The committee by a vote of14 to 1 and by a vote of 10 to 6 on an-other occasion rejected the bill's beingconsidered in this session.I agree with the Governors that weshould have tests of some of these plansto see how they would work before theyare enacted.By all means the department shouldhave set down a figure on what John Doecould have gotten under the bill, ratherthan writing up a lot of flowery language.These are the mathematical results thatwere furnished to the committee by HEWafter we began to analyze the bilLMr. PresIdent, It Is very evident thatthose charged with working out the de-CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATE S 20948tails of this proposal have fallen farshort of the President's goals.Mr. CURTIS. I submit the matter canbe brought to a vote. I do not desire totake more time on the matter.Mr. President, I yield the floor.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATE SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENTSOF 1970The Senate continued with the con-sideration of the bIll (HR. 17550) to amend the Social Security Act to provideincreases In benefits, to improve com-putation methods, and to raise the earn-ings base under the old age, survivors,and disability Insurance system, to makeimprovements in the medicare, medicaid,and maternal and child health programswith emphasis upon improvements in theoperating effectiveness of such programs,and for other purposes.December 21, 1970Mr. President, I move that the Senateagree to the conference report.The motion was agreed to.UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENTMr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. Pres-ident, under the previous order I was tobe recognized; however, the Senator fromConnecticut suggested that he has astatement to make. I would like to yieldto the Senator from Missouri and others.The Senator from Pennsylvania has astatement to make also. I ask unanimousconsent that rather than my holding thefloor and yielding to them I be recognizedand regain the floor under the previousorder when the consideration of the billis resumed.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is thereobjection?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. Pres-ident, I think the Senator from Connec-ticut wanted to proceed next. I will re-serve my remarks until tomorrow.Mr. RIBICOFF. Mr. President, argu-ments against the family assistance planhave been made in the last few days.A number of these arguments wereillustrated by the use of charts and sta-tistics. These arguments and figures havebeen used to suggest that serious workdisincentives are created or worsened byfamily assistance. This Is not the case.The Ribicoff -Bennett proposal author-izes the most significant step forward in30yearstodevelop work incentiveswithin the welfare program. This step isthe inclusion of the working poor withinthe welfare system.Over 1.8 million American families en-compassing10.5million personsare headed by full-time workers with incomeat o' below the poverty line. These fami-lies are not now eligible for Federal wel-fare assistance. Yet, under existing law,other families which might live In thesame neighborhood or even next door,are better off on welfare without work-ing. For the millions of working families,family assistance Is the first welfare pro-gram which makes it worthwhile. Underfamilyassistance,eligibilitywillno longer be confined to those who do not orcannot work. The elimination of thepresent discrimination against workingfamilies is a major work incentive.In New York City, which has admin-istered a working poor program for 20years, a 13-month study found that over97 percent of working families remainedworking families after receipt of welfarebenefits. Many of the remaining familieschanged their status only because of ill-ness or death of the father.I ask unanimous consent that a shorttable showing how family assistance willhelp the working poor be included at thispoint In the RECORD.There being no objection, the tablewas ordered to be printed in the RECORD,as follows:FAMILYOF amendment also pro-poses an expansion of Federal worktraining and child care programs. $386million would be spent in the first yearof the program for expanded day-careopportunities. More than $200 millionwill be spent to provide work trainingand upgrading program.In addition, through an amendmentproposed by Senator HARRIS and I, astrong public service job program forwelfare reciplent.s will be initiated.The greatest impediment to movingwelfare recipients from relief to workis the lack of actual jobs at the end ofthe work training programs. The Ribi-coff-Harris proposal takes a small butimportant step to remedy this problem.Under the family assistance program,every able-bodied welfare recipient willbe required to register for these work andwork training programs. Failure to soregister will mean an immediate loss of$500 of FAP benefits.The charge has also been made thatfamily assistance would further encour-age break up of families and illegitimacy.Mr. President, those problems are pre-cisely what family assistance Is designedto end\u2014not encourage. By providing as-sistance to all families\u2014not merely brok-en families, as is now the case\u2014the pro-gram eliminates the Incentive for low-income families to separate.Mr. HANSEN. Mr. President, will theSenator yield at that point?Mr. RIBICOFF. I am pleased to yield.Mr. HANSEN. According to the In-formation I have, the October revisedrevision would retain the $500 penaltyprovision, as the distinguished Senatorhas pointed out, but would delete theprovision for disregarding income taxpayments. Testimony developed at thehearings on the bill showed that the $500reduction In family assistance wouldactually result In reduction of only $241in family Income since benefits underother kinds of welfare type programsincrease as family Income decreases.May I ask the distinguished Senatorfi'om Connecticut if that checks with hisunderstanding of the bill?Mr. RIBICOFF. May I say that I donot have that Information. It would de-pend on what the total amount was thata person was receiving. I do not Imag-ine that a person with a family of fourreceiving $1,600 would be Involved muchby way of income tax. I do not have thefigures. I shall supply them for the REC-ORD, if I can, before the night Is over.Mr. HANSEN. I thank my friend.There being no objection the figureswere as follows:A family of four with no other incomewould lose $500 of family assistance if amember of that family refused to registerfor work. In addition, State supplementarypayments would be reduced by one-fourth.Thusifthe State supplement were $1,500the total loss to the family would be $875.Thisloss might be reduced by anywhere from$0 to $225 if food stamps and other programsIncreased the benefits to the family becauseof its income reduction.Mr. RIBICOFF. In addition, the mostscientific methods now In existence willbe employed to provide a continuingCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEevaluation and investigation to preventfraud in this program.It has also been mentioned that thefamily asslstan\u00f3e plan provides a $1,300incentive for couples to have children.This so-called incentive is also presentin existing programs. The defect couldbe easily remedied by providing welfareeligibility for childless couples, which Isa step I have advocated for sometimeand even proposed to the Finance Com-mittee in the form of an amendment toH.R. 16311. This, of course, would be afurther expansion of family assistance.Reliance has been placed on chartswhich attempt to set forth the \"notch\"effect of family assistance by which, itIs explained, the programs will encour-age welfare recipients not to work.These charts, which are confined toexamples of families headed by mothers,show the cumulative dollar totals of wel-fare, food stamps, medicaid, and housingprograms.It is my opinion, which is shared bymany, that these tables do not show thetrue effect of family assistance or reflectits impact on most welfare recipients.First, over 90 percent of all welfarerecipients cannot accumulate allthe benefits which are shown on these charts.Slightly over a third are eligible for foodstamps, less than 10 percent are In publichousing. Furthermore, these charts areexclusively used to show the circum-stances of female-headed families whichwill comprise less than half of the eli-gible recipients under family assistance.Families headed by a working male willnot be eligible for medicaid, or Statesupplements.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. Pres-ident, will the Senator yield?Mr. RIBICOFF. I yield.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. It istrue that the charts refer to female-headed families, but that form was se-lected by the Department Itself. Weasked If a different picture would beshown if the Department had provideddifferent charts for male-headed fami-lies, and the answer was \"No.\" If theywould provide different charts we wouldbe glad to display them. They did notsubmit any, so I assume that while thepicture would be slightly different thepatterns would be the same. If the pat-terns were not the same It Is the De-partment itself that Is at fault for notadvising us. I repeat, these are the chartsthey sent to the committee, and theyselected the type we were going t3 use.Mr. RIBICOFF. May I say to the Sen-ator that I share some of the frustra-tion mentioned by other members of theFinance Committee who are on the otherside of the issue. It Is absolutely true thatthe committee, collectively and Individ-ually, asked for information lme andtime daln, and this Information hasnot been forthcoming, I, as well as they,decry the failure to have the coopera-tion which the committee was cntltledto have. It would have made the jobof all of us that much easier If the In-formation had been forthcoming.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. That Iscorrect.If the Senator will yield further, an-other point to be made on these chartsIs that they tried to point out that thereS 20949would be a minimal effect by saying thatless than 8 percent of the people were inpublic housing. That included farm areasand rural areas, where there is no publichousing. Those figures are misleadingbecause in the city of Wilmington in myown State, the figure representing thoseunder public housing, Is not 8 percert but28 percent, while in New York State thefigure Is a much lower one. But In NewYork State and in some other States theyuse rent supplements instead of publichousing. So when they talk about pub-lic housing, they do not Include rentsupplements or various other programswhich should be included.I think all those programs must be re-lated. I know the Senator from Connec-ticut would insist on getting all thatInformation.If we take an area where public Lious-ing is not used and that item of the pro-gram is eliminated but if there is anotherprogram which Is substituted for It thatparticular program should be substi-tuted. Unfortunately we have not hadany cooperation from the Departmentin getting a real breakdown.This is not a criticism of the Senatorfrom Connecticut because he has been asfrustrated as the rest of us In getting In-formation. It has been Impossible In ourcase in view of this complete lack ofcooperation from the Department.I thank the Senator for yielding.Mr. RIBICOFP. I thank the Senator.Second, few, if any, welfare recipientsare encouraged to work or not to work byeligibility for medicaid. This Is not a cashprogram, but a health program. Sicknessis unpredictable. When no illness is In-curred no medIcaid benefits are received.it is unlikely that loss of medicaid cov-erage would deter anyone from workingparticularly when other, private healthplans would be available.Third, the family assistance plan ac-tuallycorrectsthe many additional\"notches\" which the present programperpetuates. Those few that remain arenot the result of family assistance but ofother programs. As pointed out above,many of these \"notches\" are illusory andmost are corrected by family assistance.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. Pres-Ident,will the Senator yield at thatpoint? I dislike Interrupting him.Mr. RIBICOFF. I yield.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. The Sen-ator is correct. In one city the averagemedicaid benefit was calculated at $1,100per family. It Is true that family A maynot have benefited from any medicaid atall and another family may have bene-fited to the extent of $2,500. There Is thisother factor to consider, however. WhileIt is true that a family may or may notbenefit under medicaid, depending onthe health of the family, If one goes onthe labor force and Is no longer on wel-fare he has to pay for the health Insur-ance. So that Is a deduction from pay be-cause he has to pay for that health In-surance. That Is what creates this notchplus the fact that money earned is tax-able while welfare payments are tax-exempt.Mr. RIBICOFF. I think that point willbe touched upon by the next point, thatthe family assistance program actuallycorrects the many additional notches S 20950which the plan perpetuates. It is truethat taken alone, the result of the fam-ily assistance plan is that most of thesenotches are illusory and most are cor-rected by the family assistance plan.I can understand what the Senatorfrom Delaware was trying to do in com-mittee, and I can understand his con-tinued frustration when we talk aboutthe family assistance plan and when themedicaid and housing and other pro-grams have not been drawn together tomake a whole. But when we talk of thefamily assistance plan, many of thenotches as a result of other programsCongress has adopted, including the ad-ministrationofthose programs,are eliminated.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I agreecompletely on that point. I said theother day that if we forgot momentarilythe other programs related to welfareand looked at nothing but the chartspresented on the family assistance pro-gram one could have a picture of aprogressive incentive to work. It is whenwe start considering the other programsthat notches are developed. I was disap-pointed that since the other agencies arestill a part of the Government theseplans had not been put together andconsidered as a whole.There is no excuse for their not havingbeen considered together.Mr. RmICOFF. That is one reasonwhy I have been so insistent on havingpilot programs, because the family as-sistance plan goes into effect in July of1972. It would be my hope that, in thetrial period, we in the Finance Commit-tee would monitor it very closely and getan overall picture of all the other pro-grams working together with family as-sistance, and we would have an oppor-tunity between March 1, 1972, and July1, 1972, to correct any inequities.This is a monumerital pIogram, and Ihave tried to the best of my ability, onthis floor and in committee, to point outthat we do not know all the answers, andthat I share many doubts of other Sena-tors; but I do believe in the basic philos-ophy, and that the program is worthtrying.STATE SAVINGSA point has been made that the Statefiscal savings clause In the Ribicoff -Ben-nett amendment only applies to theexpenses ol the adult categories. In factthe 90-percent-freeze clause applies tofamilies as well as aged, blind, and dis-abled recipient&Under present law welfare costs underAFDC\u2014both State and Federal\u2014are in-creasing at the rate of 30 percent an-nually. At this rate, with no change inthe law, costs will more than double in 3years. The fiscal savings provision In theRibicoff -Bennett amendment is vitallynecessary to save the States from finan-cial catastrophe.REPUBLICAN GOVERNORSMr. President, there has been somemisunderstanding regarding the positionof the Republican Governors on the Ribi-coff-Bennett amendment. I ask unan-imous consent that a copy of a telegramresponding that the Republican Gover-nors' Association favors the amendmentCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEby 14 to 2 be printed in the RECORD atthis point.The telegrp,m is dated December 16,and was sent from Sun Valley to Secre-tary Elliot Richardson.There being no objection, the telegramwas ordered to be printed in the RECORD,as follows:Secretary ELLIOT L. RICHARDSON,Department of Health, Education, and Wel-fare, Washington, D.C.:At an executive session of the RepublicanGovernors Association this noon, I presentedthe matter of the family assistance plan andthe Ribicoff-Bennett amendment. The RGAVoted to su7port the Prisident's family as-sistance plan with 14 in favor, 2 opposedand 3 abstentionsRUSSELL W. PETERSON,Governor of Delaware.Mr. TALMADGE. Mr. President, willthe Senator yield at that point?Mr. RrBICOFF. I am glad to yield tothe Senator from Georgia.Mr. TALMADGE. If the Senator willrefer to his amendment, on page 9, line10,appearsthe heading \"ExclusionsFrom Income.\"Then on page 10, beginning on line 16,it reads:(5)food stamps or any other assistance(except veterans' pensions) which is basedon need and furnished by any State or polit-ical subdivision of a State or any Federalagency, or by any private agency or organiza-tion exempt from taxation under section 501And so forth.Would that not make it possible fora foundation which is a tax-exempt or-g\u00e1nization to make grants to individualsin any amount, any sums of money an-nually, and those individuals would stillbe eligible for welfare at the same time?Mr. RIBICOFF. That is correct: Thiswould allow a foundation which wouldlike to supplement and even raise abovethe poverty level recipients of grants tomake such grants to Individuals. TheSenator is correct in his statement.Mr. TALMADGE. Let me give theSenator a hypothetical case. Many foun-dations do outstanding jobs in cancerresearch, tuberculosis research, and otherhealth matters. Suppose they take someeminent doctor, and give him a grantof $100,000 a year to do research on acure for cancer. Under that provision,would he not be eligible for welfare atthe same time?Mr. RIBICOFF. I think that is far-fetched, While it could be possible, Icannot imagine an eminent doctor whowasdoingcancerresearchwitha $100,000 a year grant who would not haveincome from a hospital or universityupon which he would have to pay taxes,but would rely upon himself and his f am-ily living on $1,600 ayear.Mr. TALMADGE. I am asking eligibility for welfare.Mr. RIBICOFF. Yes; It might author-ize his eligibility, but as a realist\u2014and Iknow the Senator from Georgia is arealist, too\u2014I have no fear of that takingplace.Mr. TALMADGE. Mr. President, we aredealing with a law now, and not a theory.The Senator admits that his amendmentwould authorize such an individual to beDecember 21, 1970eligible for welfare if he were living on agrant of $100,000 a year.Mr. RIBICOFF. Yes; but while thiscould happen, I do not think the law isthat much of an ass.Mr. TALMADGE. That is what theSenator wrote into the amendment, andI am asking him to explain it, and headmits that what I say is true. That isjust one of the many imperfections inthis amendment that I think ought to beclarified.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. Pres-ident, while, as the Senator suggests,that might be a far-fetched example ofwhat could happen. I point out thatwhen we were considering the Tax Re-form Act and that section dealing withfoundations we had an example where afoundation had taken practically the en-tire staff of the late Senator Kennedyand given them for 2 years a grant ofapproximately $25,000 a year with travelexpenses. They were going to take careof those individuals, the excuse beingthat they had no other source of in-come.On that basis, if this bill had been ineffect, all the members of the staff ofthat Senator would not only have theirgrants from that foundation but wouldbe eligible for welfare payments underthis bill because we were told in the com-mittee that they had no other source ofincome.Mr. RJBICOFF. Mr. President, I wouldlike to add that on page 10, line 17, theamendment refers to \"food stamps orany other assistance\u2014'which is basedon need.'\"I do not imagine that a research chem-ist doing research under a foundationgrant would be in need. The amend-ment also contains an assets test.Mr. TALMADGE. Will the Senatoryield RIBICOFF. I yield.Mr. TALMADGE. In line 19, the word\"or\" appears, so it is in the alternative.Mr. RIBICOFF. Mr. President, I wouldlike to pursue this matter further, butthe minority leader must make a state-ment by 6 o'clock or be taken off thefloor.As the Senator from Delaware knowsfrom our colloquy on his unanimous-consent request of a few days ago, I wasmost anxious not to have this amend-ment in the second degree. I was veryhopeful to be able to afford every Mem-ber of this body a chance to put in per-fecting amendments, whether it be theSenator from Iowa, the Senator fromOklahoma, or the Senator from Georgia.I would have been the first to try to cor-rect the point that the Senator fromGeorgia has made, but we were put inthe position that we had no alternativebut to make this amendment in the sec-ond degree.Mr. WILLIAMS ofDelaware.Mr. President, will the Senator yield?Mr. RIBICOFF. I yield.Mr.'WILLIAMS of Delaware. The Sen-ator Is correct on that point. Both he andI tried on two or three occasions to getthis bill into a posture where it could beamended and voted on on its merits, butneither of us were able to get it into thatposture. December 21, 1970Mr. JAVITSsubsequentlysaid: Mr. President, on Saturday, certain analyseswere made by the distinguished Senatorfrom Delaware respecting the effect ofthe family assistance plan contained Inthe Rlblcoff-Bennett proposal upon myState of New York. I asked the Depart-ment of Health, Education, and Welfareto analyze those analyses made by Sen-ator WILLIAMS. They do not agree withhim, Mr. President, as to their effect andthe alleged inequities which would result.I shall diseuss these in detail at an ap-propriate time, but I did feel that at theearliest moment they should stand' Inthe RECORD, so that anyone who wishesmay read these replies.So I ask unanimous consent that theletter of the Department of Health, Edu-cation, and Welfare, signed by the Hon-orable John G. Venernan, Under Secre-tary, be printed in the RECORD.There being no objection, the letterwas ordered to be printed In the RECORD,as follows:DEPARTMENT SENATOR JAVITS: The following is Inresponse to your request for comment oncertain statements made by Senator Williams(Delaware)In the Congressional Record ofDecember 19, relating to the effect of theRibicoff-Bennett proposal upon the State ofNew York.On page 520807, Senator Willlanis cites anexample that leaves the impression that theRiblcoff-Bennett proposal would pay a $1300bonus for an illegitimate child.He states that \"this bill actually providesa $1300 bonus from the Federal Oovernmentto a mother to have an illegitimate baby overand above what would be paid If the babywere born In wedlock.\"Under the existing AFDC program, a child-less couple Is not eligible for benefits\u2014norwould they be under the Family AssistancePlan. The presence of children Is required foreligibility.In fact, it Is the present program whichrewards illegitimacy. Currently, families Inwhich the father is married and working fulltime are not eligible for any federally assistedwelfare. But If the father were not marriedto the mother, she and her children wouldbe eligible. PAP, would for the first timemake the Intact family eligible thus reduc-ing the financial reward for illegitimacy.The Bill also mandates State supplementa-tion to families in which the father Is unem-ployed. This Is now done In New York on anoptional basis but It not done in 25 states. Inthese latter states, an intact family may nowreceive no assistance even though It has noincome. In contrast, families where the fatherhas deserted or in which the child Is il-legitimate would be eligible. Thus, the Ribi-coff-Bennett proposal is a step toward re-ducing illegitimacy and desertion.In Senator Williams comments he left an-other distorted Impression regarding bene-fits available In New York.In the chart published on page S 20810, anImpression is left that a family of four inNew York without any earnings would re-ceive money and benefits totaling $6210.The following facts must be considered:(a) probably no more than I or 2% of thefamilies on public assistance in New Yorkhave available to them all of the benefitslIsted on the chart.(b) only 73 % of the welfare recipients InNew York City live In public housing, whichis worth $989 to a family without income.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATENinety-two and a half percent of the familiesdo not receive this $989.(c) The Impression Is also left that allrecipients receive food stamps valued at $312annually. The fact is that 60% of the welfarerecipients In New York do not participate Inthe food stamp program.(d) The Impression Is left that every fam-ily on public assistance receives $1153 inmedical benefits. This Is the average ex-penditure in New York and is available onlyif there Is Illness. The payments are made di-rectly to the providers of the medical servicesfor an illness Incurred by the family.Another Issue was raised by Senator Wil-liams on page 20807 where he stated that \"InNew York, a welfare family will collect ahigher premium on family splitting. Theycollect $2508 more as two families than ifthey live as one family. They can collect thatevery year under this bill, If they will justseparate\u2014the husband taking part of thechildren and the wife taking the otherchildren.\"This is highly distorted, In this respect theBill does not change the present law. In NewYork, under law, a family of six, husband,wife and four children receive a total of $329per month, plus rent. A family of three re-ceives a cash payment of $179 per mohth plusrent. Thus, the total of two families of threewould be $858 per month plus rent. Thismeans that the net cash differences betweenone family of six and two families of three is$29 per month or $348 per year rather than$2508 stated by Senator Williams. The fam-ily situation with respect to rent, Medicaid,and food stamps would be the same in bothcases.If I can be of further assistance, please donot hesitate to let me know.Sincerely,JOHN 3. VENEMAN,Under Secretary.Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I haveshown a copy of this letter to SenatorWILLIAMS, who desires me to yield onthis matter.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. Pres-ident, I appreciate the Senator from NewYork putting this letter in the RECORD,and I note It Is signed by Mr. Veneman.I only point out that the charts I usedIn my statement of last Saturday andthe figures I quoted were also presentedto the committee by Mr. Veneman, thesame Mr. Veneman. This is the first timeI have heard of an administration con-tradicting his own figures by claiminghe gave false Information to a congres-sional committee.This only shows the confusion and thatthey cannot even agree 2 days at a time,because all the figures I used were overthe signature and finished by HEW Letthem decide which time they are tellingthe truth.It further supports my position thatwe should reject this bill, and I think weneed some new men in the Departmentof Health, Education, and Welfare whoat least can stay on the same side of aquestIon 24 hours.I shall discuss this letter later. Per-haps the committee erred In not placingthe Government witnesses under oath.S 20951 S 21072 SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENTSOF 1970Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, if Imay, I ask unanimous consent in accord-ance with the agreement reached somedays ago that the Senate resume the con-sideration of Calendar No. 1443, H.R.17550.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The billwill be stated by title.The assistant legislative clerk read asfollows:HR. 17550, a bill to amend the Social Se-curity Act to provide increases in benefits, toimprove computation methods, and to raisethe earnings base under the old-age, sur-vivors, and disability insurance system, tomake improvements in the medicare, medi-caid, and maternal and child health programswith emphasis upon improvements in the op-erating effectiveness of such programs, andfor other purposes.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Withoutobjection the Senate will continue withthe consideration of the bill.The Senatewillbeinorder. Themajority leader cannot be heard.Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, I sug-gest the absence of a quorum.The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. SCHWEIKER). The clerk will call the roll.The legislative clerk proceeded to callthe roll.Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, I askunanimous consent that the order for thequorum call be rescinded.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Withoutobjection, it is so ordered.Under the previous order the Senatorfrom Delaware is recognized.Mr. WILLIAMS ofDelaware.Mr. President, I am going to make anothereffort to see if we can get this particularbill off dead center.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEMr. TALMADGE. Mr. President, wecannot hear the Senator.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ate will be in order.The Senator from Delaware may pro-ceed.Mr. WILLIAMS ofDelaware.Mr. President, I am going to make anothereffort to see If we can get this bill offdead center and to a point where theSenate can vote either up or down onvarious provisions in which we are in-terested.There is no question but that thereseems to be quite a bit of controversy inthis bill.Mr. President, may we have order?The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senatorswill be seated. The Senate will be inorder.The Senator may proceed.Mr. WILLIAMS ofDelaware.Mr. President, since no one is interested, per-haps this is a good time to present theunanimous-consent request.The PRESIDING OFFICER. What Isthe request?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I thoughtI would get silence if I made that sug-gestion.The Senator from Pennsylvania ap-pears ready to object, but I hope he willnot object when the request is presented.We have a problem here where thereis considerable discussion and contro-versy about whether the Senate should orshould not agree to the family assistanceplan. There is also a controversy withregard to the trade agreements.I am going to make the suggestion thatwe delete titles 111, IV, and V from thebill, which deal with trade, the cata-strophic insurance, the welfare amend-ments, and also delete the Ribicoff-Ben-nett amendment and the Scott amend-ment and the Talmadge amendment,which I offered for the trade agreements.That would strip the bill down to titlesI and II. Title I is social security andcash benefits and title II provides revi-sions in medicare and medicaid. If wewould strip the bill down to those twotitles we could get this bill enacted thisafternoon, We could soon dispose of thesocial security section and on Mondaythe medicare and medicaid section andtake the bill to conference. This wouldget these social security increases out tothe public at an early date.If the proposal is to be successful itwould be necessary to have a gentleman'sagreement that these controversial mat-ters now being deleted will not be sub-mitted as a part of the revised bill, be-cause if one of them is submitted theothers will be submitted, and we will beback where we are now.If that is done we could ask unani-mous consent to consider the amend-ments in titles I and II en bloc for thepurpose of procedure, and they couldbe considered as original text for thepurpose of amendment. Further, I wouldagree to limit the time on all amend-ments to 1 hour.I do not know whether we could getsuch an agreement, but there must bea recognition of the fact that this billwill not become law as long as the tradesections and guaranteed annual incomeDecember 22, 1970features are added to it. In the mean-time, a lot of people who are hoping foran increase in social security benefitsare going to be disappointed.I am wondering If the Senator fromPennsylvania could go along with sucha proposal.Mr. SCOTr. Mr. President, will theSenator yield?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I yield.Mr. SCOTT. I would say, first, to theSenator that I would like to read to theSenate a letter oftoday's date addressedto Representative GERALD R. FORD of theother body. This may help answer theSenator's question. The letter states:DECEMBER 22, 1970.Hon. GERALD R. FoRD,U.S. House 0/Representatives,Washington., D.C.DEAR JERRY: In response to your questionabout my attitude toward the Social Secur-ity legislation now stalled in the Senate, beassured that I favor quick enactment.- SomeSenators contend that Social Secur-ity legislation cannot be salvaged In thisSenate unless welfare reform, appropriationbills and other vital measures are sacrificed,I am not yet willing to concede the Senate'sindifference or impotence. I have urged theSenate to bring to vote all of this importantwork that lies before it. There is still plentyof time to do what is necessary before Jan-uary 3.Should the Senate be unable or unwillingto adopt these vital measures by then, Iwill resubmit the Social Seourity benefit in-creases and welfare reform, along wh theother key bills that remain unenacted. AndI will propose that the Social Security in-creases be retroactive in their effect to Jan-uary 1, 1971, so that no Social Security re-cipient is harmed by the Senate's failure toact.Sincerely,Under the circumstances whereby thePresident has made clear his desire forthe inclusion of welfare reform and so-cial security, and the feeling we shouldact on both, I have not, of course, lodgedany objection at this time but I wouldwait until the Senator submits his pro-posal.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I willsubmit it as a unanimous-consent pro-posal because it is always gratifying tofind the Senator supporting the Presi-dent, and I would not want to let this ses-sion of Congress go by without giving himthat opportunity.Mr. SCOTT. The Senator knows I sup-port the President about as often as anyMember of the Senate, and I cite theCongressional Quarterly as evidence ofthat.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I amwell aware of the Senator's record. Healways votes with him when he thinksthe President is on his side.Mr. SCOTT. When the President isright, which is the largest part of thetime.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Seriously,I think this proposal is the only logicalsolution. As the Senator from Connecti-cut will confirm, I supported him beforeon a series of unanimous-consent re-quests to limit debate. I would like tosee this matter voted on, up or down\u2014all features of the bill.AstheSenator from Connecticutknows, I am opposed to the pending December 22,1970CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATE S 21073Ribicoff-Bennett amendment, and I ex-p'ct to vote against it. However, I havenoobjection to the Senate voting, and Ishall abide by the decision of the Senate.Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-sent now that the time on all amend-ments in this bill be limited to 2 hoursand that time on the bill not exceed 4hours with the time equally divided. Iask unanimous consent that we start vot-ing, that the amendment of the Senatorfrom Connecticut be the first amendmentvoted on, and that we vote on all amend-ments to amendments, up or down, atthis session.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is theSenator from Delaware now proposingthat as an unanimous-consent agree-ment?Mr. WiLLIAMS of Delaware. I with-hold it now, but I am going to propose It.Mr. RIBICOFF. Mr. President, will theSenator yield?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I yield.Mr. RIBICOFF. Mr. President, will theSenator agree that we vote on the Ribi-coff-Bennett proposal under the unani-mous-consent request at 5 o'clock Tues-day, December 29?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Whywait until Tuesday? Is the Senator afraidto vote tonight? We could vote in 2hours.Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-sent that time start running Immediately,that there be a time limitation on allamendments,includingtheR.iblcoff amendment, of 2 hours, and that .therebe a limitation of time on all amend-ments to amendments.Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, will theSenator yield?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I yield.Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, obviouslythe Senator knows he will get no suchunanimous-consent proposal agreed to.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I am anoptimist.Mr. JAVITS. I am sorry. I have thereservation. The Senator knows that hewill not get such a unanimous consent.On the other hand, the suggestion of theSenator from Connecticut (Mr. RisicoFF)Is an excellent one. If the Senator fromDelaware wishes to get a vote on theRibicoff amendment, I do not think any-one is afraid to do so. With respect tothe Senator's proposal, I have no objec-tionto voting today on the RIbicoff-en-nett amendment, but the Senator knowsvery well when he wraps it up with every-thing else, it is going to be objected to;and so if necessary, If the Senator Insistson pressing his request, I will object.Mr. President, I do object.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objectionis heard.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. Pres-ident, I presented this proposal In goodfaith. I realize that one amendment ata time could be taken up, and we couldget consent on it if every Senator agreed.On the other hand, we are not going toget anywhere unless we get consent toall of them. I think that is perfectlyproper procedure.Under this agreement the very firstrollcall vote would be on an amendmentto which I have very strong objectionsand one on which I will do everythingI can to urge the Senate to defeat. I amwilling to have that as the very first vote.I do not know what more one couldoffer.Since there has been an objectionthere is another possibility. In the parlia-mentary situation in which we find our-selves, the Ribicoff amendment, much tohis regret, is not subject to amendment.The Senator from Iowa has amendmentswhich he would like to be considered andthinks they should be. The Senator fromOklahoma has amendments which hewould like to offer.Since I cannot get consent to the firstrequest, I ask unanimous consent thatwe eliminate from the pending bill theRibicoff -Bennett amendment and theScott amendment and the trade amend-ment which I offered on behalf of theSenator from Georgia (Mr. TALMADGE).That would leave the bill\u2014if the Senatorfrom Pennsylvania will just wait a min-ute before objecting because it is like introducing amendments without read-ing them; sometimes it is disastrous toobject before one knows what is beingasked.That Is the first part of the proposedagreement.The second part would be to considerall the committee amendments en blocand treat the bill as original text. Thenit would be open to amendment.I would be willing to go along withthat, with the further proviso that theSenator from Connecticut (Mr. RIBI-corr) be recognized first, in order thathe may offerhisfamilyassistance amendment. It would then be the pend-ing busines before the Senate and wouldbe subject to amendment by the Senatorfrom Oklahoma or the Senator fromIowa, or whoever else wanted to offeramendments. Then we could vote onthem. That would be proper procedure.I would be willing to enter into a timelimitation on these amendments.I have discussed this matter with theSenator from Connecticut. This is nottaking his amendment down. It is onlytakinghis amendment down tempo-rarily, and he could again offer it to anypart of the bill. In that manner we wouldget to a vote. His amendment would bethe first to be offered and could be putanywhere in the bill. Then we could prornceed in an orderly manner.I would be perfectly willing to presentthat combined package as a unanimousconsent request, all with the provisionthat the Senator from Connecticut bethe first Senator to be recognized.I yield to the Senator from Vermont.Mr. AIKEN. Mr. President, there aremillions of people In this country whoare almost wholly dependent for theirwelfare and happiness on their social se-curitychecks. There are presumablyhundreds of thousands of others who aredesperately in need of medicare bene-fits, of which the Senator from Dela-ware has spoken.I do not think it is a good Christmaspresent for those people to tell them thatwe are going to insist on a situation inthe Senate which denies them even alittle bit of help which we could givethem to enable them to enjoy life a littlemore and to enjoy a little better healthwhen we vote on the request of the Sen-ator from Delaware. I think I would beashamed to object to It.Mr. RIBICOFF. Mr. President, I won-der if we can make it clear and whetherthe Senate understands what the pro-posal of the Senator from Delaware is.I would like to have it made clear.My understanding is that the Senatorfrom Delaware proposes that we with-draw both the Williams and Talmadgeamendment, the Scott and Ribicoff andBennett amendments, that all the com-mittee amendments be adopted en bloc,and that the bill be considered as orig-inal text; that at that stage the Ribicoff-Bennettamendmentwillbethe first amendment to be offered to thebill; and that then, of course, since It isin the first degree, that it will be subjectto amendments from the floor; that atime limitation be agreed upon on allamendmentstotheRibicoff-Bennettamendment and a time limitation on theBennett-Ribicoff proposal. There will bedefinitive votes on all those amendments.That is the only limitation the Sen-ator has in mind at this point.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. Pres-ident, I would have no objection to sucha limitation if we could get it. The Sen-ator from Connecticut has outlined Itcorrectly. I repeat, in this consent wewould withdraw both the Williams-Tal-madge and the Ribicoff-Bennett-Scottamendments. That would leave the billat that point as reported by the com-mittee. Then we would agree to all thecommittee amendments enbloc andtreat them as original text for the pur-pose of amendment. Then at that point,as part of the same request, the Sen-ator from Connecticut would be recog-nizedtooffertheBennett-Ribicoffamendment, or whatever amendment hewished, as a substitute for part of thebill or as an addition to the bill, and tooffer it in any manner or at any pointhe wished. In that way we could proceedto a vote.As far as I am concerned, the agree-ment could provide that the Senatorfrom Oklahoma would be the next onerecognized to offer an amendment. I donot care who offers the amendment, butlet us get to voting on it.I think the Senator from Oklahomahas an amendment. I know the Senatorfrom Iowa has an amendment.I repeat, so that we can get started, Iwould be willing to have it understoodthat included as a part of the agreementis the understanding that after the Sen-ator from Connecticut offers his amend-ment, the next amendment will be thatof the Senator from Oklahoma. I donot care who gets the floor after that. Ijust mentioned the Senator from Con-necticut so that he would know he wouldhave the first opportunity to offer hisamendment.Mr. CURTIS. Mr. President, will theSenator yield?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I yield.Mr. CURTIS. Is the Senator offerlna time limitation on all amendments tobe offered?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. No. Thatrequest was objected to earlier.After the Senator from Oklahoma of-fered his amendment he might ask for S 21074 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEDecember 22,1970consent to vote on it in 30 minutes or anhour. Or at that time we may get a broad,general agreement. That would be allright. If we tied it up this far we wouldat least have it before us in an orderlymanner.The Senator from Connecticut has re-peatedly pointed out that if we are goingto vote on his proposal it should be opento amendment. The Senator from Okla-homa and the Senator from Iowa haveamendments; I do not know of any otherSenator who has an amendment.Mr. RIBICOFF. Mr. President, will theSenator yield?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I yield.Mr. RIBICOFF. First, I would like tomake a preliminary comment that I haveknown right along that the Senator fromDelaware has been violently opposed tothe family assistance plan. He has beenconsistent in his opposition. Right fromthe start he has said he would not standin the way of a vote on the family assist-ance plan. He was not going to fflibuster.He agreed to have a vote. He wanted hisposition explained. He wanted other Sen-ators to have an opportunity to explaintheir positions.I have never felt such a sense of self-righteousness that I thought the Ben-nett-Ribicoff amendment had tobe adopted word for word as submitted. Ihave always felt that other Members ofthis body should have the opportunity ofoffering amendments to this complicatedproposal.I wonder if I could make inquiry ofthe two Senators who I know havedefinite amendments. I do not knowabout other Senators, but I know theSenator from Iowa and the Senator fromOklahoma have a series of amendmentsto offer. Would there be a willingness ontheir part to have a time limitation ontheir amendments to the Bennett-Ribi-cot! amendment, under the request madeby the Senator from Delaware?Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, will theSenator from Delaware yield, so that Imight respond to that?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I yield.Mr. HARRIS. May I say that I thinkthe Idea of making the committee billoriginal text Is the way to move on thismeasure, as I have said earlier, and .1hope we may be able to agree to do that.I certainly would be willing to have alimitation of 30 minutes, 15 minutes to aside, on the amendments which I wishto offer, because I am anxious that weget an up-or-down vote on the welfarereform proposal in amendable form.So I would be willing to agree to anysuch time limitation. I can speak onlyfor myself; there may be others whowant to be heard on the question oftime, but I would like to see this billmade original text for the purpose ofamendment, and, at least on the welfarep'oposal and social security, the medi-care and medicaid proposals, child care,and the health insurance and cata- strophicillnessproposals, have sometime limitation.Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, will theSenator from Delaware yield so that Imay respond?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I yieldto the Senator from Iowa.Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, I haveonly one printed amendment, but, as Ithink the Senator from Connecticutknows, I have three or four others, atleast, that I would like to offer.I stated the other day just what theSenator from Oklahoma has said, thatthe way to proceed on this matter, inmy judgment, was to have a time limita-tion. I think It might be better not tohave a uniform time limitation, becausesome of these amendments would re-quire longer discussion than others; butI certainly would be most happy to joinin any agreement on an ad hoc basis,preferably to have a time limitation.The Senator from Connecticut saysthat he would like to have this timeavailable and the opportunity available,and yet it was my understanding thatthe other day when the Senator fromPennsylvania tiled a technical amend-ment, the Senator from Connecticut andthe Senator from Utah were the oneswho put their amendment on that tech-nical amendment and locked it up.Mr. RrBICOFF. That is right.Mr. MILLER. And that was with fullknowledge, as I understand it; it was planned, and without consultation ofothers of us who have amendments, cer-tainly not with me and I know withoutconsulting with at least one or two otherswho have amendments.I am pleased that there has been a lit-tle reassessment of the matter. I amnot going to be a dog in the mangerabout it. I want to see progress made.But I just think that,in fairnessI should point out that the mess we arein now has been made, made deliberatelyby those who filed the technical amend-ment and the amendment to it.I am willing to go along notwithstand-ing that, and work out an agreement,but let us all very clearly understandthat we are in this mess because of adeliberate act. There was nothing ac-cidental about it at all.Mr. RIBICOFF. Mr. President, may Irespond?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I yieldto the Senator from Connecticut.Mr. RIBICOFF. There certainly wasnot anything accidental. It was delib-erate, and the reason why It was donethat way was that we did not get aunanimous-consent agreement on theoriginal proposal made by the Senatorfrom Delaware; and the Senator fromDelaware, on a parliamentary basis, hasintroduced his amendment, and a ffli-buster was going on that amendment.The Senator from Utah, the Senatorfrom Pennsylvania, and I realized thatunless we followed this procedure, wewould never get a vote on the familyassistance program, because we wouldhave a filibuster on the trade provision.I deplored it, but we had no other alterna-tive than this procedure to bring the f am-ily assistance program before the Senateas the pending order of business. We didthis deliberately; yes.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. Presi-dent, I find no fault with the procedurefollowed by the Senator from Connecti-cut. He followed the Senate rules whichapply to all of us.But I suggest that we not spend timetalking about what happened in the past.We know what happened. Let us talkabout where we are and what we can do.We are tied up in a confused mess here,let us face it. If we are not going to reachany agreement we might as well lay thebill aside, because everyone in this Cham-ber knows it is not going to be voted onunless we can get some such agreement.I am just trying to get it to a vote.I have no objection to a vote. I havenever been so conceited as to think that Ialone am right and everyone has to agreewith what I say. I just wanted Senatorsto be afforded an opportunity to listen toa little of what I have to say, and let meat least get it off my chest. They have,and I think that now an orderly pro-cedure would be to start voting on theentire bill.Let us vote on the various proposals,either up or down.Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, will theSenator yield for a question?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I yieldfor a question.Mr. MILLER. I know the Senator fromDelaware is trying very hard to help theSenate untangle itself. But suppose thatthe unanimous-consent request that heis proposing to present is agreed to, andthen suppose the Senator from Connec-ticutgoesahead andpresentshis amendment, and then amendments tothe amendment are offered\u2014and therecan be a good many of them\u2014and alongabout next Tuesday or Wednesday, wehave wound up the action on the familyassistance plan. What do we do then?There are Senators here who are verymuch interested in the trade amend-ment. Where would we go at that point?Mr. WILLIAMS ofDelaware.Mr. President, if the Senator will just with-hold that I shall tell the Senate wherewe shall be next Wednesday. We shallbe getting ready for a New Year's din-ner, but let us think about Christmasdinner right now. I would like to atleast get started on this bill. If we canget that far we shall be farther than weare now, and we shall be farther thanwe are going to be if we do not get thisoff dead center.Mr. President, I am going to make myunanimous-consent request at this time,and I want the Senator from Connecti-cut to follow it.First, I ask unanimous consent thatboth the Ribicoff amendment and theScott amendment, the Williams amend-ment, and the Talmadge amendment bedeleted from the bill, and following thatdeletion and as a part of the unanimous-consentrequest,thattheremaining committee amendments\u2014which wouldjust be a stripped bill, with nothing butcommittee amendments\u2014then be agreedto en bloc, and that, for the purpose offurther amendment,it be treated asoriginal text in the bill; and that afterthat, the Senator from Connecticut bethe first one to be tecognized, where hecan present his amendment, and thathe have the authority, at the conclusionof his speech and the presentation of hisamendment, if he wishes, to yield to theSenator from Oklahoma to present anamendment to his amendment. He can December 22, 1970 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATE S 21075do that, and we will at least be off towhere we can vote up or down on some-thing.If the Senator from Oklahoma doesnot have his amendment ready, the Sen-ator from Connecticut can yield to whomever he pleasestopresent anamendment, and at least we would bevoting.I ask unanimous consent that this bedone en bloc.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is thereobjection?Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, reservingthe right to object, I have been waitingpatiently for the Senator to yield, be-cause this is exactly the path we tra-versed the other day, and I shall object,and do object, it that is needed rightnow, for this reason, if I may just ex-plain the point:The prospect of a vote on the familyassistance plan is delightful, but it doesnot mean anything to the poor unlesssomething Is going to happen on the bill,asthe Senator from Iowa properlypointed out. Everyone knows\u2014I am notgoing to say the Senator from Delawareknows, because that Is his business\u2014butI know and most other Senators knowthat unless,ve strip from this bill every-thing but titles I and II, nothing is goingto happen. So those who are really de-sirous of working on social security\u2014and I am\u2014and those who are reallydesirous of working on the mlscell*neousmatters In title II, have a remedy, as amatter of fact. A motion can be made,notwithstanding the pendency of theR.Iblcoff-Bennett amendment, to do ex-actly that on a motion to recommit, andreport back forthwith.So, Mr. President, airs of injured in-nocence, or of seeking to make the rec-ord, or get a vote, or seek amity, whichmaterially compromise substantive is-sues, do not impress me. I am not afraidof it. I believe that a historic issue facesthe Senate In respect to the trade warand the world. That is very importantto the poor, the rich, the middle class,and all America, and I am not going tosee it sloughed off if I can help it\u2014maybeI cannot\u2014under allof these generalpleas for consensus.Mr. President, we all know what it Isabout. We are not children. We all knowvery well that there are deep issues whenyou get by titles I and II. No one has anyobjection to titles I and II, or dealingwith them, In the hope that we can dosomething for our people so that theywill get their checks a couple of months,perhaps, earlier than they would if weacted on it next year.But to engage In this byplay, I think,is a bit unworthy of the Senate.We have been over this track before.This is nothing different than what wedecided before. Obviously, if I am goingto oppose the trade section, I am goingto oppose it with every move I have opento me, and one Is to recommit it to thecommittee which put trade on\u2014with noneed for it: we do not even give theHouse of Representatives the dignity ofconsidering their bifi. We have put on allthese amendments; they did not do that,we did.So, Mr. President, I object.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-tion is heard.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. Pres-ident, so that the record will be clear, Iagree with the Senator from New Yorkin regretting that the Finance Commit-tee put the trade bill on this bill. I votedagainst it in the committee and will bevoting against that amendment when Itcomes to the floor.So on that point I do not take a backseat to the argument against the tradesection. I think it would be a mistake topass that bill, but, at the same time, letus get the record straight.I have heard the Secretary of Health,Education, and Welfare describe this billas a three-headed monster, and he re-ferred to the fact that it was three dif-ferent bills all in one. I want to get therecord straight. It is not a three-headedmonster; it is only a two-headed monsterat this point. The House bill embracedthe social security bill and medicaid andmedicare, which is titles I and II. In myopinion, that is the way the bill shouldhave been acted upon and reported tothe Senate. As the Senator from Con-necticut knows, that is what I tried todo. I opposed putting the trade sectionon this bill.Let us get the record straight. Theadministration supported putting thetrade bill on this act, and the committeeadopted it over my objections. That Isone of these so-called monsters. Nowhere today the administration Is tryingto put the family assistance plan on thebill, which is the other monster.I did not like the word \"monster\" indescribing this action, but If the adinin-istration and the Cabinet officers want todescribe this as a three-headed monsterthat was put together by the FinanceCommittee, as one member of the Fi-nance Committee and one who has beenproud to have been a member of It for 20years, I want to make it clear that it isa monster only because the administra-tion persuaded enough members of thecommittee to put on one head of themonster and that now they are trying topersuade the Sena'e to put on the otherhead. Let the administration not de-nounce action which they supported. Ithink the committee should have actedon the trade bill separately but the corn-mittee had every right to vote on theseproposals.The Senator from Georgia knows thatI took this position in the committee. Iresent those who would condemn thecommittee for following their request.The committee by a majority vote.\u2014anda comfortable majority vote\u2014voted toput this trade section on this bill. Theyhad a right to do It. The Senator fromConnecticut and the Senator from Utahhave a right to offer their amendmenteven though that amendment was de-feated in the committee. I defend theirright to offer it. They are entitled to avote, and I am only trying to help themout. I think they and other Senators areentitled to a vote, whether or not we arefor their proposal. I happen to be againstboth of these proposals which are pro-posed to be added to social security. Ivoted against these amendments in thecommittee, and I will vote against themon the floor.But I get tired of the halo some ad-ministration people put around theirheads about how they want this billwhen at the same time they are blockingthe Senate from consideration.Mr. TALMADGE. Mr. President, willthe Senator yield?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I yield.Mr. TALMADGE. As every Member ofthe Senate knows, the Constitution ofthe United States provides that th1 bodyshall adjourn sine die on January 3. Atthat time, all bills pending before Con-gressdie. Only treaties remain alivewhen Congress adjourns sine die.It has been obvious to every Memberof the Senate now for a number of daysthat no matter of great controversy couldpass in the limited time remaining forus to transact business during this Con-gress. Today is December 22. We are re-cessing today to go home and spendChristmas with our families, to return onDecember 28. That leaves only 4 or 5 daysIn which we could possibly transact busi-ness before the Senate. That leaves littleor no time to handle conference matterswith the House of Representatives andtake final action.What I think the Senate should do isto w\u00e7ap up the conference reports uponwhich it can reach agreement. In thosematters on which we cannot reach agree-ment, we ought to pass continuing resolu-tions, so that the operations of the U.S.Government can be adequately fundeduntil the next Congress convenes. Weshould lay aside matters of great contro-versy, such as the guaranteed annual in-come and the trade matter, which I hap-pen to support.The Finance Committee has pendingon the calendar the excise bill, which hasbeen passed by the House of Representa-tives. We could attach to that bill, byway of amendment, the social security in-crease that the House of Representativespassed, which is 5 percent, or the increasewhich the Senate Finance Committeehas passed, which is 10 percent. Thoseare not matters of great contro''ersy. Ithink we could act on them. speedily, andwe could adjourn and go home.In the closing days of this Congress,when the Senate has been spinning itswheels\u2014and every Member of the Senateknows it has been spinning its wheels\u2014it is a disservice to the U.S. Senate and adisservice to the country.I would hope that we would act ac-cordingly, that we could wrap up thematters upon which we can act. We couldincrease the social security benefits forour aged people, and I would hope wewould defer the other matters, wheneveryMember of this body knows that weare not going to take final action untilthe new Congress convenes next year.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I thankthe Senator.I know that the Senator from Georgiaas well as the Senator from Arizonahave felt very strongly about the needfor tradelegislation. They had aperfectright to offer this amendment to the com-mittee, and the committee overwhelm-ingly supported their position. I appre-ciate the fact that the Senator from S 21076 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEDecember 22, 1970Georgia and those who cosponsor thisamendment, in recognition of the situa-tion we are now in, are willing to recog-nize the facts of life and allow us to setaside the trade amendment and agreethat we can go on with the social se-curity.Mr. President, perhaps we cannot getunanimous consent, but perhaps we canget majority approval. I am ready tomove that H.R. 17550 be recommitted tothe Finance report back forthwith, aftermaking the following deletions:Delete titles 3, 4, and 5. Titles 3, 4, and5 and the trade amendments, the cata-strophicinsurance,andthewelfare amendments.DeletethependingWilliams-Tal-madge trade amendment.Delete the pending Ribicoff-Bennett-Scott assistance amendment.If that motion were approved it wouldleave in the bill only title 1, which dealswith changes in the Social Security Act,and title 2, which relates to changes inthe existing medicaid and medicare pro-grams.If this motion is agreed to, I wouldthen .agree to a unanimous-consent re-quest that all committee amendments intitles1 and 2 be approved en bloc andthat they be treated as original text forthe purpose of amendment. If that con-sent is granted I would then be willingto support or ask unanimous consent fora time limit not to exceed 1 hour onany amendments\u2014and we might disposeof it either this afternoon or tomorrowand let it go to conference.Later, after the social security bill ispassed, if they want to lay before theSenate another minor bill now on thecalendar, we have them there, they canmake the trade amendments or the f am-ily assistance amendment the pendingbusiness and maybe get a vote. But letus get social security out of the wayflIt.Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, will theSenator yield?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I yield.Mr. JAVITS. I have just heard SenatorTALMADGEmakethe statement he did,which I know to be a very difficult state-ment for him politically. Mine is difficultenough, considering the number of peo-ple who want FAP in my State and therelatively fewer people who are oppsedto the trade legislation. It Is a more diffi-cult statement for him politically, and Ishould like to note that fact. It is verystatesmanlike. What is more important,it is a heavy admission against interest.I wish to tell my colleague how much atleast one Senator appreciates what hehas said.Mr. TALMADOE. I am grateful to thesenior Senator from New York for hisgenerosity.Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, will theSenator yield?Mr. JAVITS. I should like to say, also,if the minority leader will Indulge me\u2014he is entitled to be recognized first\u2014thatwhat I think Senator WILLIAMS has pro-posed is probably the only practical wayout.Mr. RIBICOFF. My understanding isthat the Senator from New York ob-jected.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Not tothis.Mr. JAVITS. I do not object to that.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. This pro-posal would move that HR. 17550 be re-committed to the Finance Committee,with instructions to report back forth-with, after making the following dele-tions:Delete titles III, IV, and V.DeletethependingWilliams-Tal-madge trade amendment.Delete the pending Riblcoff-Bennett-Scott family assistance amendment.That would leave us nothing in thebill but titles I and II.I would hope that we could confinethis bill, then, to nothing but the germaneamendments and to the Social SecurityAct and dispose of the bill. If the admin-istration' thinks anything can be gainedby adjourning this Congress with thefamily assistance measure pending wecould lay before the Senate some otherbill on the calendar, offer the tradeamendments and the family assistanceamendment, and adjourn. But it is notgoing anywhere. This plan would at leastget rid of the social security bill and getIt in conference.I assure the Senator that I would co-coperate and help expedite a vote. TheSenator from Georgia (Mi'. TALMADGE)has assured me that he would cooperate.I have talked with several other c\u00f3l-leagues, the Senator from Oklahoma in-cluded, atid they are perfectly willingfor us to act on this social security bill.I do not think we have any choice exceptto approve this social security bill beforewe adjourn. We can start voting within10 minutes on the first committee amend-ment, which will be social security, andthen move right along. So far as I amconcerned, I would agree to a unanimous-consent time limit of 30 minutes on everycommittee amendment if not adopteden bloc. I am ready to vote on any ofthem.Mr. RIBICOFF. Mr. President, one ofthe problems Is that the distinguishedchairman of the committee Is not pres-ent. Unfortunately, he Is In New York.My understanding is that the airplanesare not flyIng because of the bad weathertoday and he is stuck there and cannotget 'back; so that It is difficult for me, andI would not assume to take the respon-sibility of agreeing to a proposal that hewould have to make a decision on aschairman of the committee.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I appre-ciate that. I thought that someone hadtalked to the chairman.Mr. RIBICOFF. I did not talk to himpersonally. I got this message from thestaff.Mr. TALMADGE. Mr. President, I con-cur in what the Senator from Connect!-cut (Mr. RIBICOFI) has just said. Al-though I am in agreement with the pro-posal of the Senator from Delaware, Ido not think that we should take affirma-tive action on this matter until the chair-man of the committee Is present. Hetalked to my office this morning. He wasexpecting to return from New York about3:30 p.m., so I would think he would bein this Chamber in a relatively shortperiod of time, and I would hope, there-fore, 'that the Senator from Delawarewould defer 'action on his proposal\u2014Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I cer-tainly will.Mr. TALMADGE. Until the chairmanof the committee can be present.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I cer-tainly will. I was under the, impressionthat he had been consulted. Certainly Ishall not press the proposal at this time.Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, as I under-stand the Senator's later motion, he hasdropped from his proposals any protec-tion for a vote on the family assistanceplan on this bill, and as the Senatorknows, I have a commitment that wouldnot permit me to agree to any consentwhich would involve substitution\u2014Mr. WIlLIAMS of Delaware. I appre-ciate that.Mr. SCOTT. To 'any part of the billwithout also getting the opportunity tofollow on with the family assistance plan,much as the Senator has proposed It,because I like t and would have likedto go along\u2014Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I like Itbetter.Mr. SCOTT. I like it better, too.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. But weneed 'some kind of an agreement. I thinkthe majority will vote for this compro-mise suggestion, and the Senator canvote against it; but let us see if the Sen-ate cannot work its way out of this di-lemma. I certainly will withhold this mo-tion until the chairman comes back; butI will renew it, and then I hope that wecan get this bill acted upon. Senators\u00e8hould not overlook this point-the ap-proval of this motion is the only way wecan get a chance to pass an increase insocial security benefits before adjourn-ment. I will withhold my motion andyield now to the Senator from Iowa (Mr.MILLER) for 20 to 30 mInutes.I yield the floor.Mr. RIBICOFF. Before the Senatoryields the floor, I wonder, since we haveto wait for the chairman to get back be-fore we can make any decision on thisproposal, whether the Senator from NewYork, the Senator from Iowa, the Sen-ator from Delaware, or the Senator fromOklahoma\u2014would the Senator from Del-aware be willing to make a unanimous-consent request or accede to a unani-mous-consent request, that if we took an-other minor bill that was at the desk\u2014I do not know what the title Is\u2014thereare some there\u2014to attach to It the fam-ily assistance plan and open it up toamendments with time limits, so thatbefore we go home on January 3, 1911,we would have an opportunity to voteon this family assistance plan up ordown.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I haveno objection\u2014Mr. TALMADGE. Mr. President, wouldthe Senator yield at that point?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I am notgoing to agree to voting, as the Senator December 22, 1970knows, as I am not going to supportthis. What we would run into Is just anagreement on a time limit, on that alone,and then I am caught in the position ofhaving to work against the Senator fromGeorgia, who would be caught in a boxwith his amendment. We will not getthat kind of agreement. I have no objec-tion to getting this to a vote. The Sen-ator knows that.Mr. RIBICOFF. I am just questioningaround for alternatives.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I knowthat. I would be glad to discuss it withthe Senator, but I think that if we aregoing to have to give all groups some-thing, I would very much like and feelstrongly that we need a test plan. Theadministration has said if they cannotget the family assistanceplan, theywould rather not have anything. I dis-agree with that. I think they are makinga big mistake. But if that is the waythey feel, since we would be taking awayfrom the administration the family as-sistance plan, they would be losing, I amwilling to yield on the point of the testand lock it all out and let it go over tillnext year. We will not get agreement thatwe will reach agreement\u2014we all are hav-ing to give and take.Mr. TALMADGE. I would strongly ob-ject to Senators picking out controver-sial propositions with which they are inagreement, with a time limit on theirparticular controversialproposal,but without a limitation of time on othercontroversial matters which other Sena-tors might strongly support.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. That isthe point. The Senator can go home tohis constituents and say, \"We gave alland got nothing.\" At the same time, Iwill withdraw the motion and I will beglad to confer with Senators or anyoneelse in the meantime until the chairmangets back.Mr. TALMADGE. If the Senator willyield at that point, I have been advisedthat the distinguished chairman of thecommittee is still bound by the weatherin New York, so I do not know whattime he will arrive. He is making everyeffort to get here.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Can theSenator reach him? Mr. President, I yield the floor to the Senator from Iowa(Mr. MILLER). Maybe we can reach himby telephone.The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. SCHWEIKER). The Senator from Iowa(Mr. MILLER) is now recognized.Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, I yieldbriefly to the Senator from Wyoming(Mr. HANSEN).CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATE S 21077 SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENTSOF 1970The Senate continued with the con-sideration of the bill (H,R. 17550) to amend the Social Security Act to pro-vide increases in benefits, to improvecomputation methods, and to raise theearnings base under the old-age, sur-vivors, and disability Insurance system,to make improvements in the medicare.medicaid, and maternal and child healthprograms with emphasis upon improve-ments in the operating effectiveness ofsuch programs, and for other purposes.Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, the pend-ing amendment by Senators RIBICOFFand BENNETT was maneuvered so that,under the rules of the Senate, It is notopen for any amendment at all.We hear reports that the President ismost anxious to have a vote on thisamendment.I find it hard to believe that thePresident understands the serious defi-ciencies in this amendment. If he did, Iwould expect him to urge the proponentsto call back their amendment and makeseveral modifications to it or to, at least, S 21078 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEDecember 22, 1970recall it and then file it in such manneras to permit amendments to be made.The Senators from Delaware andNebraska already pointed out some of thedeficiencies. I would like to point outsome additional ones.An analysis by the able staff of theSenate Finance Committee was preparedwith respect tothis amendment lastNovember 5, when It was before the com-mittee as the House-passed bill with cer-tain modifications.Table 1 on page A18 of the analysisdiscloses that as of January 1970 therewere nearly 10.5 millIon welfare recip-ients in this country; that under whatis now the amendment that is before us,the total eligible for welfare would benearly 24 million. I ask unanimous con-sent that the table be printed in theRECORD at this point in my remarks.There being no objection, the tabula-tion was ordered to be printed in theRECORD, as follows: TABLE 1\u2014-PROPORTION OF POPULATION ON FEDERALLY AIDED WELFARE UNDER PRESENT LAW AND ADMINISTRATION REVISED REVISION CivilianresidentpopulationFederally aided welfarerecipients, 300128Mr. President, the tableshows the tremendous Increase in poten-tialwelfarerecipientsthepending amendment would lay a foundation- forIn-the various States and possessions.In Puerto Rico, for example, which hasa population of 2.7 millIon, almost 10 per-cent of the people, or 265,000, are nowon welfare. This totalcouldriseto 800,000, or 29 percent of the population.In LouIsiana, 9 percent of the popula-tion, or 346,000, are on welfare: but thistotal could rise to 834,000 or 25 percentof the population.In MissIssippi, 9 percent of the popu-lation, or 211,000, are on welfare; but thistotal could rise to 806,000, or over 34 per-cent of the population.In my own State of Iowa, 3.3 percentof the population is now on welfare; andthis could rise to 8.5 percent under thepending amendment.The percentageincreasethatthis amendment could cause for each of theStates and possessions is set forth intable 2 on page A19 of the staff analysis,and I ask unanimous consent that thistable be printed In the RECORD at thispoint in my remarks.There being no objection, the tabula-tion was ordered to be printed in page All, the analy-sis discloses that the U.S. average of allthe States could be 12 percent on welfareunder the pending amendment; more-over, that 15 States would find from 15toenearly 35 percent of their populationseligible for welfare.Now I understand that not everyoneentitled to welfare would claim It, be- December 22,1970CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATE S 21079cause we have found this to be true underpresent law. Many of those who would beeligible would be eligible for only a verysmall amount of welfare, depending onthe level of income of the socalled \"work-ing poor\" which the administration's pro-posal seeks to cover. As a matter of prin-ciple, I can support some assistance tothe \"working poor\", because this appearsto be essential in order to carry out achange in philosophy of welfare so thatthere will be an incentive to work ratherthan not to work.During the hearings, I called attentionon several occasions- to the Secretary ofHealth, Education, and Welfare that thetremendous numbers of eligibles\u2014esle-daily In certain states\u2014was of deep con-cern to many of us on the F'inance Com-mittee. I urged him to give us some op-tional changes which would reduce thenumber, while at the same time preserv-ing the essentials of the new program.I specifically suggested that by usinga cost of living differential by regions ofthe country, and as between urban andrural welfare residents, in computing thetotal welfare package, not only wouldgreaterequitybeincorporatedinto the total welfare program, but the num-ber of eligibles would be substantially re-duced.It was not until the San Clementeconference with the President last Sep-tember 3 that the Department of Health,Education, and Welfare came forwardwith even one option, and this was mostunsatisfactory. Their analysis of the op-tion showed that by merely dividing wel-fare eligibles between those living inmetropolitan statistical areas and thoselivinginnonmetropolitanstatistical areas, nearly a half billion dollars couldbe saved. Such savings of taxpayers' dol-larsisimportant\u2014especiallyifit achieves equity among recipients.The trouble is that such a siniplisticsolution would not save as much moneyor be as equitable as it should. A metro-politan statistical area in one part ofthe United States will have a differentcost of living than one in another partofthecountry.Why,forexampleshould a welfare recipient in the Bir-mingham, Ala., area receive the sameamount of welfare as one living in theNew York or Chicago area? Further-more, why should a welfare recipient liv-ing on a small farm receive the sameamount as one living in a city of 25,000?Even the Office of Economic Oppor-tunity has established that for thoseliving on a farm the poverty standardshall be only 85 percent of that for thoseliving in the cities.To point up the need for a cost ofliving differential in this new welfareprogram, I invite attention to table 1of a report from the Bureau of LaborStatistics, issued on December 1969. Thistable reveals the differences in cost-of-living for a \"lower budget\" family offour among regions of the United Statesand between various cities within eachregion, and also between the cities andthe nonmetropolitan areas\u2014places withpopulations of 2,500 to 50,000\u2014withineach region. It will be noted that thedifferences are very substantial. For ex-ample, the cost f family consumptionitems Is $5,593 in Boston, Mass.; but Itis only $4,680 for nonmetropolitan areasin the Southern region. Of course, thedifference In cost for heat, as betweenBoston and a smaller city in the South,would acount for a considerable amountof this. In Anchorage, Alaska, the costis $7,673 and in Honolulu, Hawaii, $6,367.These figures relate to a \"lower budg-et\" family which would be somewhathigher than for a welfare family livingat the poverty line, -but they -point upwhat I have been saying about the needfor a cost-of-living differential in thisprogram. Is it equitable, I ask, for thesame amount of welfare to be paid toa family of four, for example, in thesame financial situation, living in a smalltown in the South as the amount to bepaid In Alaska? It certainly is not. Andwe should never forget that welfare issupposed to be based on need.I ask unanimous consent that thetable be inserted in the RECORD at thispoint.There being no objection, the tablewas ordered to be printed in the RECORD,as follows: DEPARTMENT OF LABOR, BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICSTABLE 1.\u2014ANNUAL COSTS OF A LOWERBUDGET FOR A 4.PERSON AreaTotalbudget December 22, 1970I Thefamily consists of an employed husband, age 38, a wife not employed outside the home, 51n total medical care, the average costs of medical insurance were weighted by the followingan 8-year-old girl, and a 13-year-old boy. proportions: 30 percent for lamilies paying full cost of insurance; 26 percent for families paying2Inaddition to family consumption and personal taxes shown separately in the table, the tstal halt cost; 44 percent br families covered by noncontributory insurance plans (paid by employer.cost of the budget includes allowances for gifts and contributions, life insurance, occupational 6Fora detailed description see the 1961 edition of the \"Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas,espenses, and social security, disability, and unemploymeot compensation tases. prepared by the Bureau of the Budget.Housing iscludeo shelter, household operations, and hooselurnishiogs.

Additionally, for 15 years,the Internal Revenue Service has beenfollowing a practice of imputing incometo those who grow a substantial amountof the produce they consume. Where thisis done by a family receiving welfare, itis obvious that the need for welfare isnot as great as in the case of a familywhich does not do so.The upshot ofallthisis that anamendment to the welfare reform billwas designed to cover these importantareas of deficiency in the bill. It not onlywould direct the Secretary of Health,Education, and Welfare to make thestudies needed to determine the cost ofliving differentials and the imputed in-come from growing a substantial amountof produce being consumed, with the as-sistance of the Department of Labor andthe Treasury Department, but the ad-justments in welfare would be put intoeffect by January 1, 1972.This amendment was offered, alongwith several other amendments and theso-called bill\u2014representing sev-eral the House-passed wel-fare the Senator fromConnecticut In the Senate Finance Com-mittee. It was clearly understood that ifthe committee agreed to the Senator'smotion, and it became attached to thesocial security bill, members of the com-mittee would then have the opportunityto present further amendments to thewelfare reform package. I might add thatI had several other amendments besidesthe cost-of-livingdifferential amend-ment, which was part of the package of-ferred by the Senat.\u00fcr from Connecticut.Senator RIBIcoFF' motion lost. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of theamendment be printed in the RECORD.There being no objection, the amend-ment was ordered to be printed in theRECORD, as follows:VARIATIONS FOR DIFFERENCES IN CosT OF LIV-ING AND FOR THE VALUE OF FOOD PRODUCEDFOR HOME CONSUMPTION(Senator MILLER'S cost of living equalizingamendment)Insert on page C107, after line 15:\"SEC. 108.(a) The Secretary of Health,Ethacatton, and Welfare shall, through ar-rangements with the Department of Laborand Treasury, with any other agency or or-ganization, public or private, which he mayfind appropriate, conduct continuing studiesto.\u2014\"(1) establish the variations which existin the cost of living between urban and ruralareas, different parts of the same States, andamong appropriate regions In the UnitedStates, and\"(2) determine the monetary value to afamily of producing food for home con-sumption.(b) On the basis of the varlatiosse in thecost of living established as a result of thestudies conducted pursuant to subsection(a), the Secretary shall, on or before Janu-ary 1, 1972, make such adjustments in anyor all of the amounts prescribed in sections442(a), 442(b), and 452(a)Of the Social Security Act, as amended by this Act and inthe amounts of food stamps provided underthe Food Stamp Act of 1964, as may be neces-sary to insure that total combined publicassistance, insofar as practicable, made equit-able for recipients wherever they may residein the United States.'(c) The Secretary shall by regulationswhich become effective ott or before Janu-ary 1,1972, prescribe a schedule of earnedIncome which is to be imputed to any familywhich produces a substantial amount of foodfor home consumption, for purposes of de-termining eligibility for and the amount offamily assistance benefits payable under partD and supplementary payments under partE of the Social Security Act, as amended bythis Act.

Now, the Senator fromConnecticut and the Senator from Utahhave offered the pending amendmentwhich some of us thought was the samepackage that had been offered in the Fi-nance Committee. But it is not the same,and the changes were certainly not dis-cussed with me. In the case of the costof living differential provisions, the pend-ing amendment merely directs the Sec-retary of Health, Education, and Welfareto make the necessary studies and thenreport back to the Congress. The direc-tive to implement these differentials byJanuary 1,1972, has been deleted. Myamendment No. 1099 would restore theoriginal language.And so we now have before us, a pack-age oalled \"welfare reform\" which wouldtreat all welfare recipients alike, whetherthey lived In Anchorage, Alaska, Boston,Mass., Chicago, Ill., a little town in Ala-bama, Puerto Rico, or on a small farmgrowing much of their own produce. Thisviolates the fundamental principle ofneed as a basis of welfare. It is discrim-inatory and inequitable. It results inadding millions of people to the welfareeligibility list who do not need to beadded, and it, therefore, is excessive inits cost to those who pay the taxes tofund it. On this one count alone, It shouldbe rejected. And I would hope that thePresident will have this serious deficiencybrought to his attention so that he willknow how his welfare reform programhas been distorted.It simply will not do to say\u2014as theSecretary of HEW did at page 600 of thehearings\u2014that State supplement varia-tions take care of the problem. Thesevariations, where they exist, are any-thing but scientifically based, and this Isbecause the States do not have the capa-bility to do so. Only the Bureau of LaborStatistics has that capability.ThereIsanother provision in thepending amendment which is inequita-ble. I refer to the \"disregard\" of incomein section 443(b) (4) on page 10. Thisprovides that welfare payments shall notbe reduced to the extent of earnings ofa family of $60 per month plus one-halfof the earnings beyond that.Senator CURTIS of Nebraska gave theFinance Committee several specific, real-life examples he had received from theDouglas County, Nebr., welfare officeshowing that, because of the present dis-regard formula for welfare, some welfarerecipients have been able to draw wel-fare even thoughtheir income wasconsiderably higher than that of otherfamilies not on welfare. Yesterday hepresented these same examples to theSenate.It seemed to me that most of the mem-bers of the committee were deeply con-cerned about such a situation, and when'we came to the disregard provisions un-der the work Incentive program, weamended them, as set forth on page 465of the pending bill. Under our change,the first $60 of earned income of individ-uals employed full time are disregarded;for those working part time, the first $30is disregarded; plus one-third of up to$300 additional earnings and one-fifthof earnings in excess of $300 In eachcase.I do not know why the authors of thepending amendment did not draft thedisregard provisions of their amendmentto reflect this change; and their failureto do so will simply mean that there willbe more eligibles for welfare who do notneed it.Another defect in the pending Ribi-coff-Bennett amendment has to withsection 464 on page 46, relating to theobligation of deserting parents. For somereason, this amendment was drafted todelete the provisions agreed upon by thecommittee, set forth in section 540 onpage 467 of the bill. These make it amisdemeanor to cross State lines to avoidparental responsibilities. They were dis-cussed by the committee with represent-atives of the Department present, whoraised no objection to them at all.The pending amendment provides fora disregard of income from vocationalrehabilitation allowances, and since thewelfare program is supposed to be gearedto the needs of recipients, there seemsno good reason to not take such allow-ances into account. It might be said thatthese are calculated to provide an in-centive, but there is no need for such in-centive if the work and training require-S 21080 December 22, 1970 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATE S 21081ments of the welfare reform program areeffectively administered.There are, of course, all in addition todefects clearly pointed out by the Sen-ator from Delaware in earlier remarks.In fairness, I should say that some de-fects in the House-passed bill have beenovercome. For example, the cash penaltyfor refusing to work has been increasedand the penalty cannot be frustrated byan increase in State supplements. How-ever, the eligibility for food stamps hasnot yet been coordinated with the pen-alty, and this should be done.As I pointed out during the executivesession the other evening, the only Mem-bers of the Senate who know any of thedetails of the Ribicoff-Bennett amend-ment and its implications are those ofus who serve on the Senate FinanceCommittee, many of whom spent weeksand months of our time during the hear-ings and committee deliberations on theprogram. To offer this amendment on atake-it-or-leave-it basis, with so manyMembers uninformed about it and withsuch serious defects clearly in it, rendersa disservice to the Senate and to theAmerican people.Running our sessions around the clock,coming in on Sunday and even on NewYear's Day, convening the new Congresson January 3\u2014all ofthese togetherdo not alter the situation at all. Thisamendment needs some very importantmodifications or what now masqueradesin the of \"welfare reform\" willbecome \"welfare inequity\" plus a tax-payers' revolt. Because of the inconsid-erate and foolhardy way this deeplyimportant matter has been brought be-fore us, with no opportunity to modify itwhatsoever, I seriously doubt that a goodpiece of legislation is possible of enact-ment. I am willing to try. I have alwaysbeen willing to try. But this willingnesshas not been reciprocated, and that is atragedy.Mr. HANSEN. Mr. President, will theSenator yield?Mr. MILLER. The Senator from Iowais pleased to yield to his friend, theSenator from Wyoming.Mr. HANSEN. Mr. President, I wouldliketo compliment our distinguishedcolleague, the Senator from Iowa, for thestatement he has just made. It has beenmy privilege to serve with him and toobserve firsthand his great backgroundof experience, knowledge, and under-standing in a field in. which I wouldsuspect no Member of the Senate exceedshis expertise. As sOme Members of theSenate know, he is a tax lawyer. Heworked for the Federal Governn,ent forseveral years before he eventually be-came a Member of this body. I have notmet anyone, since I have been a Memberof Congress, who is more expert on taxmatters on this side of the Capitol.I think we should heed well the imrportant pronouncement he has made.I quite agree with him that to deny theSenate the opportunity to amend in anyway or to consider In any way a wholeseries of amendments, which I think mustbe considered if we are going to come toany kind of workable piece of legislation,certainly does not auger well for goodgovernment.It is unfortunate that the family as-sistancebillwas brought before theHouse in such a way as to preclude anydiscussion or offering of amendmentswith alternativeproposals, which thesenior Senator from Iowa has tried toget considered in this body. He mademany importantcontributionsasa member of the Finance Committee.I say now that if we were to adoptthe pending amendment, we would notreform in a constructive way the messin which welfare now finds itself.Iagree with the President of theUnited States that welfare must be re-formed. It is extremely costly. It is notserving the purpose of encouraging peo-ple to move away from welfare into pri-vate employment. We would all like tohave theobjectivesthat have beenspelled out by the President of the United States become fact. I do not thinkthey will become fact under the terms ofthis amendment.I doubt very much if anyone who hasstudied this proposal objectively wouldhave any very \"real reason to believe thatthe President's goals would be achievedby the adoption of this amendment. I re-call the observation made by the distin-guished Senator from Connecticut whenhe said that had he known then what henow knows, he never would have rec-ommended that the medicare and medi-caid programs, which it is estimated willbe $216 billion in the red when they havebeen in operation in 20 or 25 years, beadopted without first having been tried.That is the way I feel about the familyassistance plan that is now before us.I would hope that the Members of theSenate would study closely and heed thevery profound observations made by mydistinguished colleague from Iowa.Mr. MILLER. I thank my friend fromWyoming for his generous remarks. Ican also state that day alter day theSenator from Wyoming was nearly al-ways in attendance. I am sure he wasin attendance as much as anyone on theFinance Committee through all the hear-ings and deliberations on the welfarereform proposal. I am sure he can verifythe fact that the Senator from Iowa wassecond to none in the committee in mak-ing every effort to give the administra-tion an opportunity to present its caseand to work with the administration Intrying to make some progress on thisbill, even though there were some whofelt so highly opposed to it that they ingood conscience felt it could never becleaned up to be a satisfactory program.I might say that I conferred, when-ever I had an opportunity, whenever Iwas approached, and on some occasionson my own initiative, with representa-tives of the Department of HEW, in aneffort to point out the shortcomings Ifelt were in the measure, to work withthem in trying to develop some ways ofovercoming its shortcomings.I might say that In some cases I wassatisfied.I had questions about someof the features of this bill, and sat downand spent considerable time In trying tofind out the answers to those questions;and on a great many occasions I wouldsay that I was satisfied with the answersI recelve.But the Senator from Wyoming willvouch for the fact that most of us onthe committee were concerned about onething, probably, more than anything else,and that was the thought of the tremen-dous increase in the number of eligiblesfor welfare, running up to as many as25 or 35 percent of the people in a singleState. The reaction seemed to be, \"MyGod, what are we coming to in thiscountry, when this is the kind of a pro-gram we might possibly adopt in theSenate?\"So one of the first things I tried to doduringthehearings was pointout, frankly and honestly, to the Secretaryour concern over this matter. We asked,'How can we do equity; how can we havereform and at the same time not havesuch a tremendous number of eligiblesfor public assistance? Please give ussome options so we can look them over.\"What did we get? We got one, and nota very good one at that. When I cameout with my cost-of-living differentialamendment, everything was going to bejust fine. That was going to be addedon to the package offered by the Senatorfrom Connecticut. I voted to add it on,and it was defeated.What happened then? The amend-ment was torn to pieces before it was puton the pending amendment by the Sena-tor from Connecticut and the Senatorfrom Utah; and I have never yet receiveda very good answer, I might say; in fact,I do not think there is a very good an-swer to it.Mr. President, I yield the floor.Mr. RIBICOFF. Mr. President, muchhas been said as to the attitudes of vari-ous Governors concerning the family as-sistance program. I ask unanimous con-sent to have printed in the RECORD at thispoint various statements and indicationsin support of the family assistance pro-gram by Governors and Governors-elect.There being no objection, the state-ments were ordered to be printed in theRECORD, as follows:SUPPORT OF FAPsYGOVERNORS ANDGOVERNORS-ELECTIn recent weeks we have received a greatamount of support for early passage of FAPfromboth Governors and Governors-elect.REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS' ASSOCIATIONOn Deoernber 16, 1070, in Sun Valley, Idaho,Governor Peterson of Delaware presented theFamily Assistance Plan and the Etbicofi-Bennett Amendment to the Republican Gov-ernors' association in Executive Session.

Department of Health, Education,and Welfare, Washington, D.C.DEAR SEcRETARY RICHARDSON: Thank youfor your letter of November 13, 1970 regard-ingtherevisedFamilyAssistancePlan legislation.We have already communicated with ourcongressional delegation Indicating our en-dorsement of H;R. 16311, although we aremindful that the legislation has limitations,primarily from a fiscal point of view. We areone of the states which are experiencing asevere demand on our appropriated fundsfor categorical welfare; in fact, it is clearlygoing to be necessary to request an emer-gency appropriation from the legislature inorder to complete the fiscal year. We envisionthe FAP legislation, particularly with its mostrecently proposed amendments, as being theonly long-range answer to this dilemma.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEI appreciate having the opportunity tocomment on this important legislation.Sincerely,KENNETH M. CURTIS,Governor.STATE OF CONNECTICUT,EXECUTIVE CHAMBERS,Hartford, November 27, 1970.Hon. ELLIOT L. RICHARDSON,Department of Health, Education, and Wel-fare, Washington, D.C.DEAR MR. SECRETARY: This will acknowl-edge your letter of November 13, 1970, rela-tive to the Family Assistance Plan.Connecticut continues to support the basicconcepts contained in the plan, namely, anational tscome floor, coverage for the work-ing poor, national eligibility standards andfederal administration. However, we continueto be concerned with the small amount of fis-cal relief this plan provides States like Con-necticut, which have already established highwelfare standards.I have asked our Welfare Commissioner,John Harder, to review the material submit-ted with your letter, and will submit anyadditional comments deemed appropriateupon completion of that review.We endorse the need for welfare reform andlook forward to the day when the FederalGovernment assumes complete responsibilityfor this national problem.Sincerely,JOHN DEMPSEY,Governor.STATE OF NEW JERSEY,OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR,Trenton, November 19, 1970.Copy of Letter sent by Governor William T.Cahill to all Governors on the FamilyAssistance PlanDEAR GOVERNOR: I am writing to you todayto solicit your aid in attempting to resolvewhat I regard as a seriously critical situationnationally, and one which I am sure hascaused you deep concern in your own State.I refer to our Nation's public welfare assist-ance programs.Nationally,welfarecosts and caseloadshave been soaring upward in geometric pro-portions. Sc:retary of Health, Education andWelfare, Elliott L. Richardson, announcedonly this weak that welfare caseloads for thecurrent year have already increased by a fac-tor of 20% over last year. and at this ratethe number ofcaseloadsismore than doubling every five years.The problem, as competent surveys andstatistical studies have repeatedly Indicated,is that as presently structured, our welfare,system is not really aiding those who trulyneed and deserve assistance. It is totally lack-ing in an effective delivery system and un-responsive to tle many profound changeswhich have taken place In our Nation sinceour original welfare programs were first de-veloped. It is clear that the original systemdid not envision the high degree of urbani-zation that we have today; the dramatic in-crease in numbers and classes of people whowould eventually be seeking assistance; theshift in emphasis from the very old to thevery young, and the associated problems ofincreased unemployment; and the high de-gree of mobility which has come to charac-terize our modern society. The government'sresponse to these critical changes over theyears has been a patchwork process that haslargely been a failure.I feel that as Governors of the sovereignStates, charged with administering the wel-fare programs, we must lead the way in thepush for a total overhaul of the public wel-fare assistance programs from the bottomup. We now have an eleventh hour oppor-tunity with the President's Family Assist-ance Plan now pending in the Senate. Thismeasure, which passed the House earlier thisyear, presents a sensible approach to welfareDecember 22,1970reform, including, for example, wage Incen-tives, Job training, day care, assistance Infinding Jobs, penalties for not accepting rea-sonable employment, and a national mini-mum welfare standard of $1600. If passed.the act would become effective on January 1.1972, and all States would receive an influxof substantial Federal funds as early as dur-ing the second half of fiscal 1972 to assisttheminmeetingthewelfareproblem head-on.This is the last chance, probably for years,for us to achieve meaningful welfare reform.While I cannot guarantee that the Presi-dent's welfare reform program will be with-out some flaws, I am nevertheless convincedtha.tit presents a far more acceptable al-ternative to the present system. As SecretaryRichardson stated on Sunday, \"This isn't aconservative-liberal issue; it's a question ofsensible reform of an existing mess.\"I therefore ask you to urge the U.S. Sena-tors from your State to give the President'swelfare program their support if it comes upfor a vote during the present post-electionsession.Sincerely yours,WILLIAM T. CAHILL,Governor.STATEMENT ON THE FAMILY ASSISTANCE PLANThe Administration of the State of Illinoishas carefully reviewed the Family AssistancePlan now under consideration by the Sen-ate Finance Committee.After extensive consultation and thoroughconsideration of the implications of the pro-posal, I am convinced that the program isfundamentally sound. The Senate has beforeit the greatest single opportunity to reformby 'one legislative act the way governmenttreats poor people that any legislative bodyin this nation has had in three decades.The President has adjudged our welfaresystema \"colossal failure.\" On the basis ofmy experience as the Governor of a majorindustrial state I must agree.The present system is a waste of state andfederal money. It is a system that no onelikes. And for good reason.I have heard Illinois residents complain ofintolerable Injustices in the system. Bene-fits are granted begrudgingly, without dig-nity and often arbitrarily. Desertion of fam-Ilies by fathers is encouraged. The presentsystem builds in incentives not to work.I have also seen another side. The systemplaces state government In an Impossible fis-cal and administrative situation. I have seenastronomic growths In caseload insidiouslyeat up moneys planned for other importantstate programs. I have watched these incred-ible increases in our caseloads undermine theability of my state to deliver services such aschild care, job training and work referralswhich are badly needed to get people off ofwelfare. These sky rocketing costs have di-verteci scarce dollars from housing, educationand health programs which are essential tobreak the dependency cycle. I have experi-enced the frustration of seeing directivesnot carried out because the system is un-wieldy and hopelessly complex.To my mind the present welfare system isthe single greatest threat to the continuingvitality and fiscal health of the state.This archaic and haphazard system simplymust be reformed. The Family AssistancePlan is the way to do it. Meaningful improve-ment can come only from the bold and com-prehensive change mandated by this land-mark legislation.The Family Assistance Plan would benefitthe citizens of Illinois and other states Inthe following ways:(I)It would provide, for the first time.federal assistance for families in which thefather works full time but does not earnenough to keep his family out of poverty. Itwould do this with the most effective mech-anism I know\u2014dollars, rather than services, December 22, 1970 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATE S 21083the effectiveness of which we have no ade-quate ways of measuring. I believe this ap-proach gives the poor a freedom of choice inpurchasing goods and services that will in-spire those qualities of human dignity andmotivationessentialfortrue human re-newal. Moreover, the Nixon plan giving anearnings supplement to the working poorbuilds in a direct dollar incentive to work.For many worthy citizens of fllinois, FamilyAssistance will provide deserved and signifi-cant new help.(2)It will require fundamental changesin the administration of welfare which arelong overdue. Enactment of Family Assist-ance would clear away what the Prest'denthas described as a \"federal welfare quag-mire\" and permit the states to revamp theirwelfare delivery system. Only if eligibility determination for financial assistance is sep-arated from the provision of the myriad ofsocial services, can better management beachieved. In flltnois, in anticipation of theenactment of legislation such as this, we havealready taken steps to test out the basicprecepts of the President's plan in a desig-nated geographical area. We need and wel-come the challenge and the opportunity thislegislation provides,(3) The plan will assist the states to meetthe crushing fiscal burdens of welfare; fig-ures now available show ADC costsfor Au- gust were fully 43% over the costs just oneyear ago. This is a rate of growth that totallydwarfs our annual revenue growth of 8%. ItSsize means that we must either cut backseverely on existing state programs in otherimportant areas, or place further strains ona state revenue structure that is highly re-gressive compared with the federal. Neitherof these alternatives Is sound in policy ormakes sense to the people.I have repeatedly urged the federal gov-ernment to come to the aid of the stateswith revenue sharing. For the same reasons.it must more fully fund welfare costs. TheFamily Assistance Plan is revenue sharingnow. This is the real New Federalism.Many shortcomings of the welfare sys-tem today exist because we have merelytinkered with its details and added band-aid solutions, thereby warping its underly-ing objective. The result Is an unworkablesystem for moving people out of povertyinto the mainstream of American life. It ismy strong hope that well-intentioned effortsto improve the Family Assistance legi8la-tion will not be responsible for its failure.It is time for all persons truly interestedin the improvement of our welfare systemto come to the support of this legislation.It is imperative that the states that bearthe most direct respon8ibllity for welfarehave a major voice in shaping welfare re-form policy. We all know that this legisla-tion does not provide the full federal fund-ing of welfare that the National Governors'Conference has sought. In my own budgetmessage last April, I called u.pon the federalgovernment to assume this cost and said\"The greatest single contribution that thegovernment could make to state and localgovernment would be to pay all public aidgrants.\" Nonetheless I am convinced thatthe Family Assistance Plan is a giant stepin this direction. We must recognize and ac-cept the administrative problems which theinherent in shifting from the entrenchedsystem to this new departure. But we can-not let these considerations distract us fromthe benefits this change will bring. We should not wait for the achievement of per-fection while the vicious poverty cycle inthis country continues unabated.No one piece of legislation could do every-thing I would like to see done in the fieldof social welfare,The Family Assistance Plan is the rightbeginning. There will be other opportuni-ties for further reform. I am convinced theywill come only if we succeed in this initialeffort. Only if we turn the corner with thislegislation will we be able to meet the press-ing demands for similar fundamental re-form in medical care and other essentialprograms.As the Governor of Illinois I stand foursquare behind the Family Assistance Planand offer my services to assist in its pas-sage. I intend to work with the 'Governorsof the Midwest Governors' Conference aswell as the chief executive of the large in-dustrial states to see what can be done tomove the Nixon Family Assistance Plan outof the Senate Finance Committee and intofinal enactment this year.COPY OF LETTER SENT TO GOVERNORS FROMGOVERNOR DANEVANS,WASHINGTON (ONFAMILYASSISTANCEPLAN)AUGUST27,1970Late in July, I sent you the impact of theFamily Assistance Plan (HR 16311) and in-dicated some of the problems in the legisla-tionaspresentlydrafted.Subsequently, members of my staff met with representativesof the Department of Health, Education, andWelfare, and reached agreement on certainsubstantive issues.In my opinion, thesechanges would resolve, with certain excep-tions. the major problems in the plan.The major changes on which agreementwas reached are:1. Expenditures for Aid to Families withDependentChildren-UnemployedParents and Aid to Families with Dependent Chil-dren-Foster Care will be excluded from theexpenditure base for computing the \"holdsafe\" requirement.2. The wide discretion granted to the Sec-retary of Health, Education, and Welfarewith respect to payment levels under StateSupplementationapparentlyhasalready been discussed with the Senate FinanceCommittee. If this discretion is not modifiedby the Committee so as to make mandatoryconsultation with the states on these pay-ment levels explicit in the law, HEW hasagreed to include such a provision in therules.3. If sufficient funds are not available tothe states, expenditures under Title XX canbe limited on the basis of a state's own pri-orities although a balanced program of serv-iceswillbe necessary. Additional servicescould be provided by municipalities with apopulation of 250,000 or more if there weresufficient local funds. Non-federal expendi-tures for services must be at least as high asfiscal 1971.4. Under Title XVI the recognition of theeconomy of shared living arrangements wasconsidered by HEW to be implicit in comput-ing the $110 standard. HEW agrees, how-ever, that this requirement should be madeexplicit in the law.5. Under the emergency assistance pro-vision of Title XX, the intent apparentlywas that the states define the conditions andcontent, with the Secretary of HEW settingthe outer limits. HEW agrees, however, thatthe law should be modified to indicate that\"emergency\" is to be defined by the state.The representatives of HEW consideredthat our suggestions with respect to TitleXIX would be more appropriately consideredwith the health insurance legislation to beintroduced next February rather than in con-nection with the Family Assistance Plan legislation as such. HEW will work with thestates on appropriate modification of TitleXIX prior to the submittal of such leg-islation,We still have a concern that a state mightnot be able to meet itsfiscal obligationsunder the bill at some time in the future.HEW has agreed to work with us to developlanguage that will permit the Secretary towaive part of a state's liability, should seri-ous fiscal problems develop.Although we still have certain questionsabout some aspects of the law, e.g., the liberalized definition of disability, and thefragmentation ofservices that would bepossible if cities of over 250,000 institutedtheirownservicesprogram,theabove changes overcome our major financial ob-jections to the legislation. We have alwaysbeen in favor of the intent of the FamilyAssistance Plan, and, with these financialmodifications incorporated in the legislation,we will give it our firm support.One further area that you may wish toexamine is the provision in Title XX of thebill which permits cities of over 250,000 toelect to operate their own social servicesprogram. This could make the equitableprovision of social services extremely dif-ficult in many states, and interposes an-other level in an already complex system.I urge that you carefully examine the im-pact of this provision on the ability of yourstate to deliver services effectively.I trust that you and your staff will reviewthe suggested changes and the impact onyour state. Given these changes, the \"holdsafe\" provision appears to become a sub-stantiverather than nominallimitation on state expenditures. We have appreciatedthe positive attitude of HEW staff and con-sider that solid progress has been made.We hope that you, like ourselves, will sup-port the legislation as modified.Sincerely,DANIEL J. EVANS,Governor,SEPTEMBER 25, 1970.Hon. RIcHARD M. NIXON,The White House,Washington, D.C.Mv DEAR PRESIDENT NIXON: I am most im-pressed by what I have learned about theFamily Assistance Program. I congratulateyou on your courage and vision in presentingIt to the people of this country.I am urging that you give serious con-sideration to Arkansas as a deznonstrat,ionstate. Our state stands ready to work nightand day with you In this historic undertak-ing. I have no dou'bt whatsoever that we canprove the capability such a program requires.The people of Arkansas without exception.I believe, share in endorsing the first prin-ciple of FAP\u2014to help people to help them-selves.With all ROCKEFELLER,Governor.SUN IDAHO,Secretary Halth, Education, Wel-fare, Washington, D.C.:At an executive session of the RepublicanGovernors' Association this noon, I presentedthe matter of the Family Assistance Plan andthe Ribicoff-Bennett amendment. The R.GAvoted to support the President's Family As-sistance Plan with 14 in favor, 2 opposedand 3 absentions.RUSSELL W. PETERSON,Governor of Delaware,Mr. CASE. Mr. President, as a cospon-sorofthe pending Ribicoff-Bennettamendment, I urge the Senate to actpromptly to adopt the measure.The debate over welfare reform andthe proposed family assistance plan ha,sgone on inthe Congressfor manymonths. Before the issue reached us inthe form of legislative proposals, it hadbeen debated over a period of seyeralyears by private citizens, advisory coun-cils, welfare directors, and State officials.So there is no lack of information onthis issue, nor is .there any need for fur-ther study or prolonged tests of thepending proposal, or alternative pro- S 21084posals, to determine whether reform isneeded. Those who have examined exist-ing welfare programs know the system isInefficient, unfair, and inequitable.There are no national standards foreither benefits or eligibility. There is nouniformity In Federal cost-sharing, andthe administration of public assistancevaries widely from State to State.As has been pointed out, what we have,In short, Is really 54 different programsin 54 different jurisdictions throughoutthe United States. Each State sets itsown standard of need. Each State deter-mines who will be eligible. Each State de-cides how much It will pay. And eachState gets a different share from the Fed-eral Government. -Isit any wonder the system is notworking and the people it is supposed tohelp are frustrated?The continuation of a system so de-monstrably inequitable and inefficient isnot fair to the poor\u2014especially thosewho need help and are not getting it un-der the categorical approach\u2014and it isnot fair to States and cities.Welfare is no longer a local problem.We have become a highly mobile societyand we have encouraged people to seekemployment in urban centers where jobsand industries are located. The move-ment of people into cities and their in-ability to obtain employment, because oflack of skills and lack of opportunity, hascaused welfare rolls to mushroom. Mostof these people have no recourse but toseek help through the aid to dependentchildren program.In my own State of New Jersey, three-fourths of all our public welfare expen-ditures go into this program. Accordingto Governor Cahill, the average monthlynumber of welfare recipients rose from106,000 to 306,000 during the past 5 years,an increase of nearly 200 percent. Netexpenditures for this program\u2014Federal,State. and county\u2014rose from $59 to $216million, a rise of approximately 270 per-cent. And State expenditures increasedfrom $17 to $99 million, or a rise of 500percent. I am told that total State ex-penditures for welfare\u2014and medicaid\u2014are expected to increase as much as 53percent, or $100 million, next year alone.Obviously, neither New Jersey norother States experiencing similar sky-rocketing costs can afford to continue tobear the financial cost of what must berecognized as a national problem, Helpfrom the Federal Government Is long overdue.The family assistance plan does notdo all I think it should, but it does rep-resent a substantial Improvement overthe conglomeration of the 54 programswe currently have. Moreover, as nowamended, FAP would provide, In addi-tion to national minimum standards andwork incentives, fiscal relief to the Stateson a permanent basis by freezing theirfuture welfare costs to 90 percent of their1971 costs.The Riblcoff-Bennett amendment Isthe product of weeks of effort by the ad-ministration and various Members ofCongress to develop a fair, workable bill.It represents, I believe, the best hope ofmoving toward welfare reform this year.Of course, even If FAP is adopted, Itwill not provide the kind of immediateCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEhelp needed by local governments. Therewill be a lag of at least 12 to 18 monthsbefore the new program is implementedby the States, during which time wel-fare costs are expected to continue toescalate.That is the reason I recently intro-duced an amendment to title II of H.R.17550 to increase the Federal share ofthe cost of medicaid and current publicassistance programs from the presentminimum of 50 percent to a new mini-mum of 72 percent.The effect of my amendment wouldbe to provide $2.3 billion In urgentlyneeded Federal aid to three-fourths ofthe States, including those States bear-ing the heaviest burden of welfare costs.My amendment is not offered as a substi-tute for FAP but simply as a way of pro-viding some relief until the family assist-ance program, If adopted by Congress,goes into effect.I hope it will be possible to vote onboth the Ribicoff-Bennett amendmentand on my amendment before the Sen-ate adjourns.Mr. WILLIAMS of New Jersey. Mr.President, 35 years ago this Nation madea commitment to enable the elderly tolive a life of dignity and self-respect inretirement. Enactment of the Social Se-curity Act was a landmark in social leg-islation. It once again affirmed the highvalue we place upon human dignitythroughout a lifetime.Today social security protects work-ers and their families from loss of earn-ings because of retirement, death, or dis-ability.Without these benefits, many olderAmericans would be forced to go on therelief rolls or to depend upon relativeswho frequently would not have the re-sources to support them.And without these benefits 19 out of20 beneficIaries would not even achievea moderate standard of living.Yet, the vast majority of older Ameri-cans are experiencing a retirement In-come crisis which Is worsening, ratherthan improving:Nearly 5 million elderly persons fall be-low the poverty line;Over 2 million are on welfare; andOnly about 1 in 5 has a job, usuallypart time and at lower wages,Today older Americans are twice aslikely to be poor as compared to youngerpersons. One out of every four persons 65and older\u2014in contrast to one In ninefor younger individuals\u2014lives In poverty.Even, more disturbing, their aggregatenumbers in poverty are now Increasing,for the first time. Since 1968 the totalnumber of elderly persons living In pov-erty jumped by nearly 200,000\u2014from 4.6to 4.8 mIllion. In sharp contrast, thenumber of younger persons who would beconsidered poor declined by almost 1.3million, about a 6-percent reduction.These figures clearly show that piece-meal, stopgap measures are just not go-ing to work. Today's retirement incomeproblems cannot be solved by adding afew dollars every year or two to socIalsecurity.Immediate and far-reaching action Isneeded on several fronts.The bill before us today has severalprovisions which will be of vital helpDecember 22,1970to individuals living on limited fixedincomes.Several provisions, in fact, represent amajor step forward in dealing with thepresent retirement income crisis. Theyare identical or very similar to proposalsI have advanced In my omnibus socialsecurity legislation and other proposalsto help the aged.A 10-PERCENT BENEFIT INCRRASEIfl May, the House of Representativespasseda5-percentacross-the-boardraise,effective in1971. This increasewould, of course, be welcome by our Na-tion's 20 million older Americans,However, our cost of living has beenrising at an annual rate of about 6 per-cent\u2014the most rampant inflation in nearly 20 years.At this rate, the 5-percent benefit In-crease would be wiped out before a socialsecurity beneficiary received his first check reflecting this raise.Spiraling inflation continues to rob thepocketbook of every American. But nogroup is hurt more badly than olderAmericans living on fixed Incomes.As prices go up, their meager purchas-ing power goesdown\u2014usually quitesharply.For an average retired couple, a 10-percent benefit increase would mean anadditional $118 In annual benefits abovethe House level, or approximately $10 amonth.MINIMUM BENEFITSAnother significant Improvement Inthe Finance Committee billis the sub-stantial increase in minimum monthlybenefits.Minimum benefits for a single personnow amounts to $64 a month.The 5-percent increase authorized inthe House bill would only have the effectof raising this present inadequate baseby $3.20 a month\u2014from $64 to $67.20.This is only a token amount and wouldbe completely unrealistic for a personsubsisting in poverty.The Senate bill would help to Improvethis measure substantially by providing aminimum monthly benefit of $100. Thisbadly needed reform can be one of themost significant measures in the bill be-fore us.LIBERALIZATION OF THE EARNINGS TESTUnder present law, a person under 72may earn up to $1,680 in annual incomebefore his social security benefits are re-duced.For many senior citizens who need towork because of inadequate social secu-rity benefits, this limitation operates as aformidable barrier.In both the House and Senate bills,the existing earnings test Is raised to amore realistic level\u2014$2,000 before socialsecurity benefits would be reduced.In addition, $1 in benefits would bewithheld for each $2 of earnings abovethe $2,000 cutoff point. Under existinglaw, this one for two feature only appliesto a $1,200 earnings band\u2014from $1,680to $2,880. 100-PERCENT BENEFIT FOR WIDOWSAnother far-reaching reform In boththe House and Senate versions Is mymeasure to provide 100-percent benefitsfor widows. December 22,1970CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATE S 21085At present, they receive only 82 per-cent of the primary benefit of their de-ceased spouse.One of the pressing reasons for mak-ing this urgently needed change is thatapproxinustely six out of every 10 widowsliving alone have incomes below the pov-erty line. Especially disadvantaged arethe Nation's very oldest women.Another compelling argument for thismeasure was advanced by Dr. JosephPechman of the Brookings Institute:An Increase in the widow's benefits to afull 100 percent of P/A (the primary benefitamount that had been payable to the hus-band) would more effectively aid the poor,per dollar of added cost, than any otherchange in the system, inclffding a minimumbenefit.It is estimated that this change alonecan provide an additional $260 in annualincome for widows. Approximately 2.'?million widows and widowers will be ben-efited from this change.AGE-62 COMPUTATION POINT FOR MENMy proposal to provide an age-62computation point for benefits for men\u2014the same as now exists for women\u2014hasalso been incorporated in both the Houseand Senate bills.Under present law, 3 more years areused in computing benefits for a manthan are used for a woman of the sameage.This difference in the treatment ofmen and women can result In signifi-cantly lower benefits being paid to a re-tired man than are paid to a retiredwoman with the same average earnings.When thechange in the committee billis fully operational, the benefits for mostmen would be higher than under presentlaw. And higher benefits would be paidto the dependents of retired men and tothe survivors of men who die after age62.LIBERALIZED ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS FORDISABILI'rYINSURANCEA number of improvements were alsomade in the Finance Committee bill toimprove the present disability provisions.For example, the Senate bill reducesthe waiting period to qualify for dis-ability benefits 6 to 4 months.Moreover, blind persons will be ableto qualify for disability benefits, pro-vided they have worked under social se-curity for 6 quarters.UPDATING RETIP.EMENT INCOME CREDITIn addition, the Finance Committeebill also incorporates my proposal to up-date the retirement income credit forretired teachers, firemen, policemen, andother Government annuitants.The purpose of the credit is to placethesepensionerson a substantiallyequivalent tax basis with social securitybeneficiaries.Social security benefits are, of course,tax exempt. Government annuitants re-ceive comparable tax relief by claiminga 15-percent credit on income\u2014their pensions, an-nuities, rents, interest, and dividends.But thecreditno longerprovides equivalent relief because it has not beenupdated for 8 long years. During thattime, there have been three badly neededsocial security increases. And hopefully,we will soon enact a fourth raise to helpbring retirement income up to a morerealistic level.My amendment\u2014which was adoptedin modified form\u2014would help to correctthis longstanding inequity.It would do this by raising the maxi-mum amount for computing the 15-per-cent credit from $1,524 to $1,872 for asingle person and from $2,286 to $2,808for an elderly married couple.This could mean a possible tax sav-ings of $52 for a single retiree and $78for a married couple.SECTION 225One especially objectionable feature inthe House-passed bill was section 225,which provided for a one-third cutbackin Federal funding after 60 days formedicaid patients in hospitals or 90 daysfor persons in nursing homes or mentalinstitutions.This is in spite of the fact that two-thirds of all nursing home residents re-quire more than 90 days' care.This ill-advised proposal could havedealt a crippling blow to the availabilityor quality of care for medicaid patients.Since medicaid patients are unable topay for their own medical care, thiscrushing burden would fall directly onthe States. And we know that virtuallyevery State in the Union lacks sufficientresources to assume this additional sub-stantial burden.In the committee bill, there would becutbacks in Federal funding for institu-tional care only when adequate profes-sional review and medical audit func-tions are not effectively applied. However,States properly carrying out these func-tions would not be affected by any cut-back provision.FINANCING OF COST-OF-LIVING INCREASESIn spite of the overall worthiness ofthe bill, one especially controversial pro-vision has arisen, and that is the methodof financing the cost-of-living increase.To pay for these increases, approxi-mately 50 percent would come from rais-ing the tax rates and 50 percent from in-creasing the taxable wage base.The effect of this measure is that alarge portion of this burden would beshouldered by people earning low in-comes\u2014people who can least afford atax Increase.Since the payroll tax rate would beuniformly applied to all covered individ-uals, workers with low earnings wouldpay a proportionately higher percentageof their total income than higher paidpersons.Once again, this underscores the needf or well-timed and well-conceived use ofgeneral revenues to help finance a por-tion of the social security program.The advantage of this approach Is thatit would provide a more equitable meansfor financing this essential, but still Im-perfect program.It would not result in burdensome pay-roll taxes being imposed upon today'sworkers. And it would make the taxstructure for financing the program moreprogressive.Mr. President, the overall study of the\"economics of aging\" by the SenateCommittee on Aging\u2014of which I amchairman\u2014has helped make the case forbadly needed reform in social security.The bill before us today represents asignificant step forward in many re-spects. But our task is still not complete.Further reform is still needed and willbe discussed in much greater detail Inthe Committee on Aging's final report onthe economics of aging, which will beissued in the very near future.A recent letter from Mr. Nelson Cruik-shank, president of the National Councilof Senior Citizens, makes a very percep-tive analysis of some of the major pro-visions in the 1970 social security bill.His comments about the financing ofthecost-of-livingincrease,especially merit the serious attention of all Mem-bers of the Senate.Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-sent that this letter be printed in theRECORD for my colleagues to read.There being no objection, the letterwas ordered to be printed In the RECORD,as follows:NATIONAL COUNCIL OF SENIORCrrIzENs, INC.,Washington, H.R. 17550 (Social Security Amend-ments of 1970) which we understand is be-ing reported by the Senate Finance Corn-niittee and will probably be before the entireSenate this week.As you know, this Is a very complex billcontaining many proposals for changes inthe basic Social Security program in Medi-care, Medicaid, and Public Welfare. In oneway or another practically all these pro- posals affect the well being of the older peo-ple of this country and we would havepreferred that there were time for us tomake an analysis of all the proposals andto present our views in detail. However, itappears that In the short time remaining tothis Congress this will not be possible.There are some major provisions of thismeasure before you on which we would ap-preciate the opportunity of presenting ourviews.cAsH BENEFITSThe first of these is the matter of in-creasing the cash benefits under the Old-Age,SurvivorsandDisabilityprograms.The House-passed bill provides but a meagre fivepercent across-the-board Fi-nance Committee increasewith $100 per month minirnwn benefit.While this represents a substantial improve-ment, it still falls short of meeting the eco-nomic needs of the elderly who, In the faceof inflationary increases in living costs, arewitnessingtheerosionoftheiralready meagre incomes.About 9 out of 10 older people now receiveSocial. Security benefits and are largely de-pendent on them as witnessed by the factthat one quarter of the married couple bene-ficiaries and one half of the non-marriedhave other income of less than $40.00 a month per person. Average Social Securitybenefits are $117 a month for retired work-ers.Inflation has hit older people the hardestbecause their incomes rise slowly\u2014If at afl\u2014and because the greatest price increases havetaken place in such necessities as homemaintenance, Insurance, taxes, medical careand transportation. The most seriously af-fected are older widows or unmarried womenwho form the largest single element In theolder population. The average Social Secu-rity benefit for widows Is $101 a month. S 21086It is for such reasons that we appeal toyou to give primary consideration to in-creases in cash benefits. Whatever disposi-tion the Senate may make of the manyother proposals contained in HR. 17550\u2014thisis one on which we feel confident youwill want to take immediate action. Andwe urge you to take such action as will assurethat whatever comes out of conference willprovide not less than a 10 percent increasewith the minimum benefit of 8100 a month.COST OF LIVING INCREASESSecondly, we have some very definite viewsof the proposals for Increases in benefitsgeared to increases in living costs which wewould like you to consider.We are, of course, not opposed to increaseswhatever their basis. But we want to empha-size the position we have consistently taken,namely that cost-of-living percentage in-creases applied to the present low level ofbenefits as a base, will not alone meet theincome needs of the elderly. To do this re-quires substantial improvements in presentbenefit amounts. Future needs could then bemet in large measure by automajic increasesbased on a cost-of-living figures.But if the steadily improving standard ofliving provided by the dynamic Americaneconomy is to be shared by the elderly. Con-gress must continue, as It has in the past,to review periodically the requirements andresources of the Social Security system andmake such adjustments as appear necessaryand feasible in the light of current economicand social conditions.Both provisions for automatic adjustmentand for continuing responsibility of the Con-gress in this area appear to be provided inthe escalator provision of the Senate Com-mittee bill. Except that in this bill the pro-visions for financing the increases are lessequitable, in our view, than those of theHouse-passed bill which would finance theincreased benefits by Increases In contribu-tion and benefit bases, also geared to in-creases in cost-of-living.Consequently, we would urge that theprovisions for financing the cost-of-living in-creases contained in the House bill be re-tained along with the provision for \"inter-vening\" by the Congress, as contained in theFinance Committee bill. We feel strongly thatthe burden ofrisingbenefitsgearedto cost-of-living should not be borne by workers(and their employers)in the lower wagebrackets, as would be the case under thefinancing provision of the Senate Commit-tee bill.RETIREMENT TESTFinally, we support the proposed changesin the retirement test which are Identical inboth the House-passed bill and the SenateCommittee bill. The liberalizations of thetest both for the present and those for thefuture geared to cost-of-living, appear asmoderate adjustments required by changingconditions. We are opposed to any proposalsfor eliminating the test entirely. or for morefar-reaching changes than those containedin the present bill.The National Council of Senior C),tizens,like many members of Congress, I am sure.has been called upon to request eliminationof the retirement test on the allegations thatthe Social Security program should not 'pre-vent people from working.\" In response tothese requests we made a thorough study ofthe purpose and operation of. the test andconcluded that it would be most unfair tothe great majority of retirees if this test wereto be eliminated. After wide distribution ofthe results of this study by every meansavailable, our membership has supported ouropposition to removal of the test.The main reasons for this position are (1)most elderly are not able to work, even if jobsin the present labor market were available.(2) removing the test would be of benefit toless than 10 percent of the elderly and thisCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEwould include those who need help least ofall: professional people, business executivesand others who for the most part do not relymainly on Social Security benefits for theirlivelihood and (3) the cost which would runabout $2.75 billion the first year and more inlater years, would undoubtedly prevent in-creases in benefits for those much more inneed.We appreciate your giving our views con-sideration as this very vital measure comesbefore you for action. If we can be of anyassistance in further clarifying our position,or in any other way, please feel free to call onus.Sincerely and respectfully yours,NELSON H. CEUIKSHANK,President.Mr. FANNIN. Mr. President, presenta-tions by several members of the FinanceCommittee, from both parties, have 11-]ustrated the fallacy that the familyassistance plan would create Incentivesfor people to work rather than not towork.Supposedlyworkfare was thefoundation of this program but it Is nowevident we need a pilot project to makeitpossible for Information to be de-veloped to prepare legislation for pro-grams to accomplish this objective.We need to determine what can bedone to provide jobs for people underthis program. At the present time wehave a serious unemployment problemin this country and we must find a solu-tion. Many of these people are on wel-f are.Mr. President, the Secretary of Health,Education, and Welfare has estimatedthe current welfare caseload In the Na-tion at 12.6 million.This is an Increase of 2 million personsover the same date 1 year ago.Secretary Richardson has also beenquoted as saying that In some Statesthe hike in welfare caseloads Is up asmuch as 30 percent over last year. Thismeans that caseloads In some areas aremore than doubled every 5 years.President Nixon has set the currentwelfare budget at $8.7 billion\u2014yet It isexpected that the actual cost this fiscalyear will soar over $10 billion.This welfare load already is a very sub-stantial burden on the hard-working peo-ple of our Nation.And yet, here we are discussing a pro-gram to double the number of personswho qualify to collect welfare payments.This simply is not fair to those peoplein our society who work day in and dayout to carry their own weight.Mr. President, we have run the gamutof suggestions as to what income a per-son is entitled to as a birthright IrthisNation. It ranges from $1,600 to morethan $7,000\u2014depending on which advo-cate of the guaranteed annual wage youmay talk. to.What in the world has happened toour country?Why are we so determined to traveldown the same road that proved so dis-astrous to the British?Our Nation became great and power-ful by offering people opportunities\u2014notby guaranteeing them handouts. Ourpeople have prospered because of theirsweat and toll and their willingness tosacrifice.Perhaps it is a bit old fashioned, butI believe that some of the principles thatDecember 22, 1970made our country great still are valid. Ido not see why we should pick the year1970\u2014or 1971\u2014to switch to a socialisticphilosophy whichiscontrary to ourheritage,Those who have promoted the variousguaranteed annuaj wage programs overthe years have dwelled on the plight ofthe poor. And I can appreciate this con-cern. I too am concerned aboUt the plightof the poor. We certainly have not doneenough for the aged and the ill who aredeserving of much more consideration.But let us talk for just a moment aboutthe plight of the working man andwoman and his family.Throughout our history the bulk ofAmericans have been willing\u2014and Inmost cases even thankful\u2014to labor hardfor their livelihood. They have beenjustly proud to carry their own weightand do an extra bit to help their Nation.Millions have started work in theirteens. Mostly they have had preciouslittle education. Many have worked alltheir adult lives, 5 and 6 days a week atlabor that is perhaps monotonous, per-haps tedious, perhaps physically exhaust-ing.Theseproudmasseshavenot sought\u2014nor would most of them have ac-cepted\u2014a chance to freeload on theirfellow workers.Now, suddenly in the latter half of the20th century, we have a strange, newmovement afoot. There Is a faction thatcontends that people have a right tofreeload on their fellows, that no one hasan obligation to help carry his share inpaying the price of making society run.Advocates of the guaranteed annualwage\u2014or the family assistance plan asit is called In this case\u2014make it soundas though welfare payments somehowmaterialize magically. They foster theold, worn myth that the State is some-thing with endless resources that canprovide for the needs and desires ofeveryone,But we know better, Or at least I hopewe do.The Government has nothing to giveto anybody that it does not first takefrom someone else.If we double the welfare roles, then wemultiply accordingly the amount of taxmoney that we must extract from thehard-working man to give to the non-productive members of our society.This is not a scheme to take from therich and give to the poor.It is a scheme to take from the middle-and low-income worker\u2014already strug-gling against inflation\u2014to give to thepoor, whether the poor be deserving ofhelp or not. Again, I say that I am notbeing critical of persons who have alegitimate claim to welfare, such as theaged or the ill who cannot work.Mr. President, I am pleading for theman who is determined to do whateverhe can to pay his own way In the besto1 Am,erican tradition. This Is the manwho would be the victim of the misguidedlegislation we are considering.There is a lot of talk about the rightof every man to live with dignity.Too many of those people willing tolive off the labor of others do not knowthe meaning of the word \"dignity.\"We have an unfortunate situation in December 22,1970ourNation at the current time wheremany well-educated or well-trained menand women, eager to work, cannot findemployment in their chosen field.These people are having a hard timemaintaining their dignity. But many ofthem are doing it, and doing it the hardway. It is dignity when an engineer takesa job as a cab driver because he is de-termined to support his own familyrather than go on the public dole.It is dignity when a cab driver whois out of work seeks any kind of manuallabor to support his family.Recently there was a newspaper ar-ticle which indicated that a job lackedproper dignity because it paid a work-man only $3 per hour.To me, a man who fails to work at ajob paying $300 a month in wages othat he can collect $300 a month in wel-fare has no dignity.Mr. President, what we need is to re-form our welfare system\u2014not expandit.The proposal we have before us justadds another layer to the same old mess.We must have a program to encouragepeople to get off welfare. We must havesoniething to break the pattern of gen-eration after generation of welfare f am-ilies. We must halt the proliferation ofwelfare provisions that encourage peo-ple to keep their hands out.The Government is only the inter-mediaryinthis.\u2014the handout reallycomes from the man who has done hisday's work. It is taken from the working-man and from the workingman's family.What we need is a workfare program.We need meaningful reforms that willadequately provide for those unfortunatepeople who cannotpossiblysupport themselves. We need to kick the peren-nial freeloaders, those who can work butwill not, off the welfare rolls. And weneed to offer incentives to put the pro-spectively productive members of our so-ciety back to work.There are those in our Nation whowould sit back gladly and accept a freeride. They would feel not the slightestembarrassment or remorse. They believepeople who work are suckers. These peo-pie are immoral.And there are dther disadvantagedpeople we are trying to inspire to workwho would be irrevocably damaged byany guaranteed annual wage scheme.These people are willing to subsist, andto have their children subsist. They wouldbe content with year; they wouldbe per year; theywould be with $4,000 oeryear.These people are not immoral. Theirmores\u2014or lifesiyle to use the moderncliche\u2014has never looked upon labor asa virtue and they feel no scrupples aboutliving forever on whatever is given tothem. As I said, subsistence is the essenceof theirlife. This program would beruinous to them.Mr. President, we already have seenthe phenomenon of welfare recipientsorganizing to demand more and morefrom the Government. We have seenthem \"occupy\" the office of a secretary ofwelfare.Now, we have before us a plan to dou-ble the number of persons who wouldCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEhave credentials to join such pressure or-ganizations and join in such disruptivetactics.We would have roughly one out of ninepersons in this country on welfare. Thisquarter of a million persons would be atremendous political bloc. The politicianplaying to this group would have to offermore and more benefits. He would haveto promise to take more and more fromthe assembly lineworkers,butchers, mechanics, office workers, and other pro-ductive members of society to give tothose who not only can not work butthose who simply do not want to work.Mr. President, if this were a good pro-gram\u2014and it is not a good program, butif it wer. a good program\u2014now would bethe wrong time to try to launch it.Our Federal Government already isfaced with a deficit of $10 to $15 billion\u2014and perhaps even more\u2014during the cur-rent fiscal year.What we need at this time are pro-grams to put people in jobs, not on wel-fare rolls. We have an unacceptably highrate of unemployment. Welfare is notthe answer.Those who have been trying to sell usthe family assistance plan talk vaguelyabout getting welfare recipients even-tually into jobs. Yet their program makesno provision for new jobs. No one is say-ing where these jobs are going to comefrom.What escapes me, Mr. President, is thelogic of some of the people who are 100percent for expanding welfare and yetdead set against other legislation to pro-tect American jobs. It is inconceivablethat we can survive as a nation of wel-fare recipients after we have exportedvirtually all of our manufacturing jobs.I think that the welfare reform issueis very closely tied in with the trade bill,Mr. President, and that is why I feltcompelled to mention it at this point.I certainly am not opposed to welfarereform.In the Finance Committee, I voted fora pilot program to test out some of thereform theories. We would have a chanceto see what incentives are effective ingetting people off welfare and into pro-ductive work.This is the only sensible way to ap-proach the issue.Voting for a multibillion dollar newwelfare program without a pilot projectis like voting for production of a multi-billion dollar new airplane\u2014we mighttake the SST as an example-withoutproviding for testing of prototypes.I want to see if the family assistanceplan will fly.And more important, I want to see ifit is going to fatally pollute the atmos-phere of our Nation.The proposal before us is fraught withdangers. It is built on estimates and as-sumptions of doubtful value.A trial run could either prove that theproposalsare sound\u2014or demonstratethat disaster would strike a full-blownprogram if it were attempted.I firmly believe that the family assist-ance plan as now offered would be adisaster for the Nation.This Is not something I say lightly.I have supported 99 percent of Presi-dent Nixon's programs, but I most del-S 21087initely oppose the program before us andeverything offered so far by the ad-ministration.President Nixon had a good idea\u2014awork Incentive program to cure the illsof the welfare system.The idea obviously went astray in theDepartment of Health, Education, andWelfare. The program presented to us isnot only a continuation of the same oldmisdirected welfare concept, but an ex-pansion of the fiasco.We have a program here which isaimed strictly at increasing the welfarerolls. It offers no real incentives to putpeople to work. It offers no machineryfor encouraging or preserving jobs, or ofgetting welfare people into productivepositions.If this program is approved, I sayagain,itwill be a disaster for ourcountry.Mr. MATHIAS. Mr. President, we aredebating the most important domesticlegislation of this Congress. I regret thatwe are doing so under the pressures ofadjournment and under a tangled parlia-mentary situation. The administration'sFamily Assistance plan is so importantthat it deserves our most earnest anddirect consideration.The President has called this legisla-tion the keystone of his entire programof domestic reforms. I was proud to co-sponsor the original version of the planlast year and am pleased to join in spon-soring the current proposal. It is theproduct of years of study by many per-captive individuals, including the VicePresident, who was among the first toadvocate a Federal floor under welfarepayments as a means of relieving thefiscal burdens on the States.This legislation, If adopted, will havea constructive impact on millions ofAmericans, bath those who, as taxpayers,are now forced to support the obsoletewelfare system, and those who, as re-cipients, are subject to its inequalitiesand whims.Especially important is the import ofthe Nixon proposal for the coming gen-eration of Americans. We have an op..portunity here and now to take a longstep toward freeing millions of childrenfrom the tragic welfare cycle of de-pendence and poverty, and enabllngthem to grow up in a united family, Inan atmosphere of dignity and self-reli-ance. In an eloquent address to theWhite House Conference on Children onDecember 13, the President spoke of themeaning of the Family Assistance planfor the next generation. I ask unanimousconsent to include the text of the Presi-dent's remarks in. the REcORD at theconclusion of my statement.Mr. President, the Family AmistancePlan Is based on the premise that allAmericans need money to live ai in-centive to work. Beyond that, It estab-lishes national uniform eligibility stand-ards, and narrows the present variationsin benefits. It combines strong work in-centives with work requirements. Pt willlift a great and growing financial burdenfrom State and local governments, en-abling them to turn their limited re-sources to other pressing public prob-lems. S 21088This legislation is not perfect; no billo.f this scope could fully satisfy everyone.But it is a bold step forward and deservesSenate approval this year.There being no objection, the text ofthe President's remarks was ordered tobe printed in the RECORD, as follows:REMARKS OF THE PRESIDENT AT TEE WHITEHOTJSE CONFERENCE ON CHILDRENMr. Secretary, Mr. Mayor, Mr. Chairman,and ladies and gentlemen, all of the dele-gates to this Conference:Before I begin my prepared text, I wouldlike to express my deep appreciation to allof you who have come to this Conference,and also for the very special entrance thatwas arranged on this occasion.One of the great privileges for the Presi-dent of the United States, of course, is tohear Hail to the Chief. I have heard It manytimes since I became President almost twoyears ago. I have never heard it played betterthan by the East Atlanta School from overhere, an elementary school.Speaking as one who played a very poorSecond violin in a high school orchestra, Iappreciate all of the work and the talent thatis represented therein by the leader who wasable to develop those talents.I am very proud tonight to share with sixof my predecessors, starting with TheodoreRoosevelt and most recently, Dwight Eisen-hower, the honor of convening a White HouseConference on Children. I take very specialpleasure In welcoming all of you here.Our concern at this Conference is with thewell-being of 55 million Individual humanbeings who happen to be children under theage of 14. and who represent one-fourth ofall the people in America.When I refer to them as 55 million individ-ual human beings, I mean to put the em-phasis precisely on that\u2014in the fact thatnothing Is so intensely personal as the pri-vate world of the child; nothing so removedfrom the statistical abstractions of a chartor a computer.in talking about our children, we are talk-ing about our world and about its future,but in the most special, the most human,the most individual sense of anything we door consider.The refreshing little flower emblem thathas been used as the symbol of this Con-ference is a reminder to us of one very simpleand very basic truth: that the world of thechild is different and very special, and fullof promise and very much alive.It also reminds us that whether we speakof a community of 200 people or of 200 mil-lion. the Important thing to remember isthat no two are alike.I am sure some of you have heard thelittle television commercial, a musical one,that has the little ditty that goes 'No oneelse in the whole human race Is exactly likeyou.\"Because of this, what is right for one childmay be all wrong for another.Here in Washington, In government, wehave a tendency to think about things in themass, about cities of more than a million orless than a million, of people over 85 or thoseunder 21, about whole school systems orhealth delivery systems.Just yesterday. I spent a great part of theday working on next year's Federal budget,on billions for this and billions for that, andhow perhaps $100 million could be savedhere in order to do something we want todosomeplace else; trying to balance the needsand hopes of dozens of government depart-ments and agencies that operate thousandsof programs involving millions of people.Sometimes after a day like that, I find my-self reflecting on both the necessity and thenthe impersonality of it all. Budgets have to bemade and they have to be followed becausetbt is the way the real world operates. AndCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEgovernments have to deal with great massesof people because this is the way govern-ments opei'ate.But how far removed this can get us fromthe perspective of the individual person. Howgreat a tendency there is in government tolose track of people as people, to get sowrapped up in charts and projections andcolumns of numbers that we lose sight ofwhat ultimately It is all about.If there is one thought more than anyother that I would like to leave with you, allof the 4,000 delegates to this Conference, it isthis: to remember that what matters is oneperson, one child, unlike any other, wIth hisown hopes and his own dreams and his ownfears, who lives at the center of his ownseparate and very personal world,I am sure that each one of you is here tak-ing part in this great Conference because youdo care not only about children in the mass,but about the child. I hope you will help usin government to keep the focus on that onechild.One of the special glories of America is thatwe are a nation of individuals and Individ-ualists. We produce people, not automatons.We recognize diversity not as an evil but asa virtue. We turn not to one institution alonebut to many to perform the great task ofachieving a better life for all of us.We recognize, of course, the role for gov-ernment, for the church, the home, theschool, the volunteer agencies that are sodistinctive a feature of American life. Andwe do know that this is a case in which in-dividual cooks, and additional cooks, do en-rich the broth.There is, of course, a large and vital rolegovernment must play in insuring the bestpossible opportunities for the child.Tonight I would like to speak briefly toyou about just one government program,a Federal Government program, presentlybeing considered by the United States Sen-ate, which Ibelieve particularly deservesyour support.The great issue concerning family andchild welfare in the United States is theissue of family income.For generations, social thinkers have arguedthat there is such a thing as a minimumnecessary family income, and that no fam-ily should be required to subsist on less. Itis a simple idea, but very profound in itsconsequences.On August 11, 1969, over a year ago, I pro-posed that for the first time in America'shistory we in this great, rich country estab-lish a floor under the income of every Amen-can family with children. It has, in turn,been called by others the most importantpiece of domestic legislation to be introducedin Congress in two generations.In terms of its consequences for children,I think It can be fairly said to be the mostimportant piece of social legislation in thehistory of this Nation. I am sure you knowthe story of the legislation. In April, it passedthe House of Representatives by almost 2-to-1. Then it became mired down in the Senate.Itis still stuck there, but itis not lost. There isstill an opportunity for the 91stCongress to change the world of Americanchildren by enacting Family Assistance.In these closIng days of that Congress, Iwant to emphasize once again unequivocallymy personal support for the welfare reformthis year. and to urge your support for wel-fare reform this year.In the last 10 years alone\u2014listen to this\u2014the number of children on welfare in Ameri-ca has tripled to more than six million.Think of it\u2014six million children\u2014six mil-lion children caught up in an unfair andtragic system that rewards people for notworking instead of providing incentives forself-support and independence; that drivesfamilies apart, instead of bringing them to-gether; that brings welfare snoopers intoDecember 22, 1970their homes, that robs them of pride and de-stroys dignity. I believe we should changethat.The welfare system has become a consuin-Ing, monstrous, inhuman outrage against thecommunity, against the family, against theindividual, and most of all against the verychildren who are our concern, your concern,in this great Conference, the children it ismeant to help.We have taken long strides\u2014not enough,but long strides\u2014toward ending racial segre-gation In America. But welfare segregationcan be almost as insidious.Think what it means to a sensitive child.Let me give you one example. My daugh-ter Tricia does tutoring at an inner-cityschool here in Washington, She tells me ofher deep concern each day to see the welfarechildren herded into an auditorium for a freelunch, While the others bring ttheir lunchesand eat in the classroom.We have to find ways of ending this sortof separation. The point is not the qualityof the lunch. As a matter of fact, she tellsme that the free iunoh is probably nutri-tionally better than the ones the othersbring from home.The point is the stigmatizing by separa-tion of the welfare children as welfare chil-dren,I remember back in the Depression years\u2014and if this dates me, if you can remember,you can remember, too\u2014of the 1930's, howdeeply I felt about the plight of those peo-ple my own age who used to come into myfather's store when they couldn't pay thebill, because their fathers were out of work,and how this seemed to separate them fromothers in our school.None of us had any money In those days,but those in families where there were nojobs and there was nothing but the littlethat relief then offered suffered from morethan simply going without. What they suf-fered was a hurt to their pride that manycarried with them for the rest of their lives,I also remember my older brother. He hadtuberculosis for five years. The hospital anddoctor bills were more than we could afford.In the five years before he died, my mothernever bought a new dress. We were poor bytoday's standards, and I suppose we werepoor even by Depression standards.But the wonder of it was that we didn'tknow it. Somehow my mother and father,with their love, their pride, their courageand self-sacrifices were able to qreate a spiritof self-respect in our family so that we hadno sense of being inferior to others whohad more.Today's welfare child is not so fortunate.His family may have enough to get by onand, as a matter of fact, they may haveeven more in a material sense than many ofus had in those Depression years. But nomatter how much pride and courage his pa-rents have, he knows they are poor and hecan feel that soul-stifling patronizing at-titude that follows the dole.Perhaps he watches while a caseworker\u2014a caseworker who himself is trapped in asystem that wastes on policing talents thatcould be used for helping\u2014watches whilethis caseworker is forced by the system topoke around in the child's apartment, check-ing on how the money is spent, or whetherhis mother might be hiding his father inthe closet.This sort of indignity is hard enough onthe mother. It is enough of a blow to herpride and to her self-respect. But think ofwhat it must mean to a sensitive child.We have a chance now to give that childa chance-a chance to grow up without hav-ing his schoolmates throw in his face the factthat he is on welfare and without makinghim feel that he is therefore something lessthan other children.Our task Is not only to lilt people out ofpoverty but from the standpoint of the child December 22,1970CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATE S 21089our task is to erase the stigma of welfare,illegitimacy and of hardship, and to restorepride, dignity and self-respect for every childin America.I don't contend before this sophisticatedaudience of critics that our Family Assist-ance Plan is perfect. Secretary Richardson,who has been before the Senate, will be ableto answer questions that you may put to himbecause he has been before a very, verycritical body.But I am only going to suggest this: Inthis confused, complex and intensely humanarea no perfect program is possible, and cer-tainly none is possible that will please every-body. But this is a good program, and a pro-gram immensely better than what we havenow, and vastly important to the future ofthis country\u2014and especially to the neediestof our children. It is time to get rid of thepresent welfare program and get a new one,and now is the time to do it.For the United States Senate to adjournwithout enacting this measure would be atragedy of missed opportunity for Americaand particularly for the children of America.I have dwelt at some length on FamilyAssistance because of its vital and even his-toric importance and because now is thetime for Senate decision.This represents, as I indicated, one of thethings the Federal Government can do togive children a better opportunity.There are others: our programs for theright to read, our emphasis on the first fiveyears of life through the new Office of ChildDevelopment in the Department of HEW, oneducation reform, on food, nutrition, and inmany others, where we are trying to meetwhat I believe is a great responsibility thatrests with the Federal Government.I know in this Conference you will havemany new ideas for things we in Govern-ment, in the Federal Government, might do.We shall do our best to meet our respon-sibility in those areas where the FederalGovernment can best do what needs to bedone. But I would also stress that equallyand often more important Is what Statesand communities do, and the school, thechurch, the family, the mass media, the vol-unteer organizations, each of us as individ-uals. For the child is not raised by govern-ment; the child is raised by his family. HIscharacter is shaped by those people he en-counters in his daily life.I think especially of the millions of Amer-icans who give their time, their energy andtheir heart to volunteer activities workingwith children. You know them in your com-munities\u2014thousands, hundreds ofthou-sands all over America.Before becoming President, Iserved as National Chairman of the Boys Clubs ofAmerica. I saw from the inside the wonder-ful work organizations like the Boys Clubsand others do, and also the spirit and dedi-cation of the people who make them possible.There are churches and service organiza-tions, hundreds, thousands of organizationsall across America, helping. They can helpmore.And most important, these volunteer or-ganizations can do what government cannotdo: they can give heart and inspire hope,and they can address themselves not simplyto children as a group but to that one spe-cial. precious child.Before closing tonight.I would like toleave with you a few very personal reflectionsfrom the perspective of the office I hold.A President of the United States alwaysthinks about the legacy that he would liketo leave the country from the years he servesin this office.I think often about that Interms of what I can leave for America'schildren.I know that the first thing I would liketo do for them is to bring peace to Americaand to the world. And here I speak not justof ending the war, but of ending It in a waythat will contribute to a lasting peace, sothat theirs, at last, can be what we havenot yet had in this century\u2014a genetation ofpeace,I speak not only of the absence of war,but also of a peace in which we can have anopen world in which all the peoples of theworld will have a chance to know one an-other, to communicate with one another, torespect one another.The second thing that as PresidentI would like to leave for America's children isa strong, productive and creative economy\u2014one that can provide every family with afloor under its income higher than what isnow the ceiling for most of the world's peo-ples.I want to leave them an economy thatprovides jobs for all with equal and fullopportunity, jobs producing not for war butproducing for peace.And beyond this, I want, as you want,America's children in the last generation ofthis century to have the best education, thebest health, the best housing that any chil-dren have had anywhere, anytime.I want them to enjoy clean air, clean wa-ter. the open spaces, to restore the heritageof nature that is rightfully theirs.Although we will always have differenceshere in America, because this is a very di-verse country, I hope that Government canhelp achieve a better understanding amongthe generations, the races, thereligions, among those with different values and dif-ferent life styles.I would like to do all this and do it inthe climate of freedom.I want this generation of children to de-velop a new sense of ratriotism.Edmund Burr pointed out that patriotismtranslated literally means love of country.And he went on further to say that for usto love our country, our country must belovely.We do love our country'\u2014most of us\u2014butwe know it has many unlovely features. I want young Americans to learntolove America. not because it is the richest coun-try, or the strongest, or merely because theywere born here, but because America is trulya good country and becoming better, becauseit is truly a lovely country.I am convinced that in my term as Presi-dent we made some progress towards thesegoals that I outlined and I think that weby the end, will have made more progress.But even if aP these goals could be fullyachieved, itstill would not meet our dutyto our children.No matter what Government does for peo-ple. no matter what we provide in the wayof income, housing or food. we still have notreached the essential element as far as a fulland meaningful lifeis concerned. becausewhat is most important is that every personin this country must be able to feel that hecounts.We have to let 55 million very young Amer-cans, as well as those a little older perhaps,know that what they do matters, that theirideas count, that the country needs theirthoughts, their creativity, their contribu-tions.I recall Dr. Walter Judd once said that heloved his daughter very much. and thenwhen she asked him to help her with herarithmetic, he really could do it much bet-ter than she could, the easiest thing for himto do would be simply to do it for her. Butbecause he loved her, he would not do itfor her. He helped her learn to do it her-self.While this conference willand should make recommendations as to what Govern-ment can do for children, about how we canmake life better for them, let us rememberthat what is most important is to providethe opportunity for each of our children toparticipate, for each child.It is not just a matter of what more Gov-ernment is going to do for him, but how hisown life is going to be enriched so that he cando something for his fellow man.A sense of dignity, a sense of Identity, ofpride, of self respect\u2014these no governmentcan provide. Government can help to createbetter conditions. It can help remove obsta-clestothechild'sdevelopment.Itcan mobilize research and provide services. It canoffer advice and guidance. But all these onlyhelp to make success possible.The love, understanding, the compassion,the human concern that touch the child andmake him what he cn become\u2014these areprovided by people, people like you.And the way we shape the character ofthe next generation we test our own charac-ter as people. And the vigor and the realismwith which we approach the needs of thenext generation, of each and every child Inthatgeneration,testsourdevotionto humanity and our belief in ourselves.I am confident we will meet that test. AndI am grateful, very grateful, to all of youhere for the concern you have shown, the ded-ication you have demonstrated, In helpingus to do so.Your recommendations at the conclusionof your conference on Friday will receive themost careful consideration by the variousagencies to which they will be referred andby the President of the United States, notonly because we in this Administration re-spect your view, but also because we shareyour concern. We share your concern aboutour Nation's children, our children. We shareyour concern that our children should re-ceive the best that America can give them,Now, ladies and gentlemen, having con-cluded my formal remarks, I would like togive you a very special invitation and ex-plain the nature of it.When I learned about this conference, Isuggested to your Chairman, Steve Hess, thatMrs. Nixon and I would like to receive all ofthe delegates to the conference at the WhiteHouse. He said, \"There are 4,000.\"I checked with our staff to see whether thatwould be possible, and they figured out thatbased on an experience over the past twoyears of moving receiving lines as fast as wepossibly could, it would take six hours and18 minutes to get 4,000 people through theline.I said we couldn't do that because I thought the people at the end of the linemight get tired by the end of six hours and18 minutes.But I do think you should know that to-morrow the Christmas decorations at theWhite House will be completed. Those whohave seen them think they are the most beau-tiful they have ever seen,We have various nights blocked out. Mon-day night is the Congress: Tuesday night isthe Congress; Thursday night are the diplo-matic children, and so forth,But Wednesday night belongs to you.We have arranged for a special tour, Mr.Hess and his staff will arrange the buses andall the other various means of transporta-tion that are needed to get you there,We have arranged a special tour of theWhite House to see the Christmas lights andwe hope that some members of our familycan be there at least part of the tIme togreet some of you,Thank you very much, We wish you thevery best. December 28,1970CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014SENATE S21217 SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENTSOF 1910The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. BocGs). The hour of 2 o'clock having ar-nved, the Chair now lays before the Sen-ate the un\u00f1nished business which theclerk will state.The assistant legislative clerk read asfollows: S 21218 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEDecember 28, 1970HR. 17550, to amend the Social SecurityAct to provide increases In benefits, to im-prove computation methods, and to raisethe earnings base under the old-age, sur-vivors, and disability insurance system, tomakeImprovementsin the medicare. medi-caid, and maternal and child health pro-grams with emphasis upon improvements inLhe operating eectiveness of such programs,md for other purposes.The Senate resumed the considerationof the bill.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, it is clearto me, and I believe by now to a majorityof the Senate, that if we are to pass abill to provide for increases in social se-curity payments even to offset the in-creases in the cost of living that haveoccurred during the past year, it cannotbe accompanied by amendments relatingto trade and to the family assistance pro-gram. Therefore, in order that 26 mil-lionsocialsecuritybeneficiaries whowould be benefited by this piece of legis-lation not be denied those benefits, andin order that the least controversial pro-visions of this measure might be con-sidered by the Senate and become law,which I believe is the minimum the pub-lic has a right to expect of us in Con-gress, I am going to make a motion torecommit and report back.Mr. President, I move that H.R. 17550,the Social Security Amendments of 1970,be recommitted to the Committee on Fi-nance with instructions toreportit forthwith, after making the followingmodifications:On page 319, strike line 11 and all thatfollows through page 404, line 25. (This isTitle III, the Trade Act of 1970, and Title IV,the Catastrophic Health Insurance Program.)On page 482, strike out line 12 and all thatfollows through page 483. line 18. (This de-letes the prohibition against use of Federalfunds to undermine programs under the So-cial Security Act.) On page 488. strike outline 1 and all that follows through page 499,lIne 10. (ThIs deletes sections 561 and 562of Title V. relating to tests of welfare andworkfare plans.) On page 514, strike line 8and all that follows through page 519. line 7.(This is a veterans pension increase, alreadyenacted In a separate bill.)Delete all pending floor amendments, asfollows:No. 1169 (Riblcoff modi-fled Scott.No.1158(WilliamsofDelawareand others).The PRESIDING OFFICER. If theSenator will send the motion to the deskthe clerk will report It.The assistant legislative clerk read asfollows:Mr. LONG. I move that HR. 17550, the So-cial Security Amendments of 1970, be re-committed to the Committee on Financewith instructions as set forth by me.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, I make thismotion on behalf of myself and the Sen-ator from Delaware (Mr. WILLIAMS) withwhom I have discussed this matter andwith whom I find myself in agreement.A motion of this sort is necessary inorder to expedite the action of this Con-gress.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I am gladtojoin the Senator from Louisiana,chairman of the committee, as a cospon-sor. To make the record clear, this mo-tion would strike out titles UI and IV,the trade amendments and the cata-strophic health insurance part. It wouldalso strike out those sections of title Vwhich the Senator has enumerated andalsothe pendingflooramendments,which are the Rlbicoff-Bennett and theScott amendments, and the amendmentthat was offered by the Senator fromGeorgia and myself dealing with tradeamendments, and require the FinanceCommittee to report back sections 1 and2 as the committee originally reportedthem to the Senate but with the modifi-cation as outlined for title 5. Am I correctin that understanding?Mr. LONG. That is correct. I personal-ly very much dislike to move to strikesome parts from the bill after havingvoted for them. I would like to see thema part of the bill. Likewise, in committeeI voted to add the alnendment known asthe Ribicoff-Bennett amendment. Butthis also provides to strike the cata-strophic health insurance part, which ismy own handiwork, and which I hope Imay be permitted to say with some prideof authorship is perhaps the best thing inthe bill. It Vas agreed on in the com-mittee by a vote of 13 to 2. But, Mr.President, these are matters which in allprobability the House would not acceptin conference even if they did pass theSenate. I have been led to believe thatwould be the case if we went to con-ference.I would not want the responsibility ofthe Congress.adjourning without havinga minimumachievedthatcanbe achieved so far as social security bene-fits are concerned. The minimum wouldbe the 5-percent across-the-board in-crease provided by the House bill al-though the cost of living has alreadygone up more than 5 percent this year.So I would think, in conference betweenthe Senate and the House, that the Housewould agree to as much of a social se-curity increase as would represent anincrease in the cost of living, and per-haps they might agree to go somewhatfurther than that. I am confident theSenate will send back to the conferencewhat It voted on before, when It votedthe $100 minimum for social securityand the necessary financing to pay forIt. That would be In conference and Iam confident the House would be will-ing to consider It, along with the Sen-ate and House cost-of-living proposal,and the reforms In medicaid and medi-care.If my motion is not agreed to it wouldmean 26millionbeneficiariesunder social security will have been deniedjustice by the Senate and the House. Ido not think the Senate wants that tohappen. I do not. On that basis, I feel Itis my duty to make this motion. We havehad a test vote on the family assistanceplan.I know that there are enough votes topass the trade package, if we could getto a vote. I know that we cannot get thatto a vote, so it Is not likely to happen.When I made the motion to table thefamily assistance amendment, only a fewSenators voted to table it. If the motionwere to be made again, I know therewould be more, but It would serve no pur-pose to continue debate over that. Iwould hope that the trade advocates aswell as the family assistance advocateswould be willing to agree, quite ap,artfrom those two measures, to considerthe good that is in the bill and that itdeserves passage by the Senate and ac-tion by Congress before we go home.Mr. President, I would therefore hopethat the Senate would see fit to agree tothe motion.Mr. RIBICOFF. Mr. President, I op-pose the motion of our distinguishedchairman.This, to me, is the tragic end to a no-ble cause. It is a noble cause that thePresident of the United States has ad-vocated since he became President of ourgreat Nation.Frankly, I was surprised to see thisproposal come from the Nixon admin-istratjon. I applauded the President forhis imagination and dedication when hepinpointed the family assistance pro-posal as the most meaningful vehiclewith which to start the United States onthe road to eliminating poverty.I am at a loss to understand how any-one in an affluent nation such as ourscould even question the objective of apowerful and rich nation to see to it thata family of four would have a minimumincome of $1,600. I for one, believe that$1,600 for a family of four is the verybarest minimum.The President's proposal has been be-fore Congress for some 16 months. It hasbeen before the Senate for 8 months,having passed the House of Representa-tives in April.The Ribicoff-Bennett amendment hasbeen the pending business before theSenate for more than a week.This proposal has been endorsed bysix former Secretaries of HEW, as wellas many public and private groups.It has the support of the Democraticand Republican Governors across the Na-tion who have to live With the problem ofwelfare on a day-to-day and a year-to-year basis.The proposal provides a new frame-work to replace the present disastrouswelfare system. It provides a means fordealing with children, the aged, blind,and disabled. It is coupled with strongwork requirements. It provides for fiscalassistance to the States.One of the proposals In the amend-ment\u2014which was a late starter, itis true\u2014Is a proposal that I thought wasimportant, and the administration hasagreed with me, that the time has cometo give a sense of certainty to every Statein the Nation.Every State in the Nation Is on theverge of bankruptcy. Their budgets showred ink year in and year out. There is nota Governor who knows from year to yearwhat his budget requirements will be.We have finally assured, in this pro-posal, each and every State that theamounts the States would be required topay for welfare would never exceed 90percent of their expenditures in 1971, ad-justed for the cost-of-living increases.Here Is a measure that has been de-bated. It has been In the public pressand in the public eye.The Senate Finance Committee helddays upon days of hearings. We spentdays upon days in executive session. Icannotunderstand how we in the Senate December 28, 1970 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATE S 21219can go home by noon of January 3dwithout giving the Senate an opportunityto vote yes or no on family assistance.The least we could do, it would seemto me, would be to vote upon the matterand show our constituents and the coun-try how the Senate is divided on familyassistance. Are we for it or against it?I appreciate the objective\u2014and it is amost worthy one\u2014of the chairman, to atleast pass the increases in social securityby January 1. But in any event, the bene-ficiaries under social security will not re-ceive their payments on January 1. Theywill not start receiving their paymentsuntil April 1 retroactive to January 1.Representative MILLs, chairman of theWays and Means Committee, and theranking minority member, Representa-tive BYRNES, have said publicly that anysocial security bill passed after January3, 1971, would be retroactive to January1, 1971.The President of the United States hasalso made the statement and the com-mitment to the 26 millIon people who areunder social security that if Congresspasses a social security bill in 1971, hewill advocate that it be retroactive toJanuary 1, 1971. Consequently, not onesingle person of the 26 million bene-ficiaries will lose a penny by our delayingthe passage of the social security pro-posals until early in February or Marchinstead of at the present time. Thismatter is too important to be sloughedaside.I disagree with the President of theUnited States on many of his proposals.I disagree with the President of theUnited States on many of his vetoes. ButI am completely in accord with him onhis concept that the time has come toreform welfare. The President of theUnited States has come up with one ofthe most imaginative programs in theentire social field. It is a matter that wemust address ourselves to during thenext decade. It would be tragic if we wereto go home without voting up or downthe family assistance program.I for one would hope that the motionto recommit would fail.Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, I am go-ing to support the motion. I do so withmixed emotions.I must say to my friend, the Senatorfrom Connecticut, that I do not believehe has properly stated the case becausethe case Is not merely one of voting up ordown the family assistance plan.The case is a matter of voting up ordown an amendment that is far morethan just a simple $1,600 family assist-ance proposition. It Is a tremendouslylong package oflegislative languagewhich has been massaged and remas-saged for weeks before the Senate Fi-nance Committee. It does not even con-tain all of the provisions which many ofus in the Finance Committee wanted tosee in the measure. It is almost in thesame form that was discussed by theGovernors' conference when we had fiveGovernors representing the Governors'conference before the committee. Theconsensus of those Governors was thatthey did not want this bill. What theywanted to have was this bill with mod!-fications. Unfortunately, we do not havethe bill with modifications\u2014at least, notthe modifications some of them weretalking about.We just have a long, well-intentionedamendment which is now locked in sothat amendments cannot be offered to it.When I raised the point with the Senatorfrom Connecticut the other day aboutopening this up to amendment, I was toldthat we did not dare do so because therewould be many amendments and wewould never get the amendments takencare of.I do not know why we did not try itthat way first instead of using a parlia-mentary tactic which now puts this mat-ter before the Senate in such a positionthat those who would like to see some-thing done about the miserable welfaresituation cannot in good conscience votefor the measure because it is overloaded.The Senator from Delaware, the Sen-ator from Nebraska, and I have pointedout some of the serious defects that existin the measure as It is now pending be-fore the Senate.I might say furthermore that I do notthink it is calling a spade a spade to talkabout no one being able to live on $1,600a year. That is not the proposition beforethe Senate at all. What we are consider-ing is a total welfare package whichamounts to perhaps up to $3,500 to $4,000a year.Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, maywe have order?The PRESIDINGOFFICER(Mr. BooGs). The Senator will suspend for amoment. The Senator from Massachu-setts Is correct. The Chamber is not inorder.The Senator may proceed.Mr. MILLER. What we are talkingabout isa total welfare package ofwhich $1,600 is merely a part. If onewishes to be realistic about it, we aretalking about a package consisting of$1,600 for a family of four, plus foodstamps, plus State supplements, plusmedicare, and in many cases, plus pub-lic housing, with a total welfare packagecoming to $3,500 to $4,000 a year for afamily of four. So let us not talk aboutnobody being able to live on $1,600 ayear, because nobody Is being asked tolive on $1,600 a year.I deeply regret that a parliamentarymaneuver was entered into by the pro-ponentsofthe pending amendmentwhich has placed it before the Senatewithout the Senate having an opportu-nity to offer a single amendment to it, tomodify it so that some of those seriousdeficiencies which have been pointed out,and which Senators can read about inth RECORD, could be removed from thepending amendment.I think the record will bear out thatI was one of the members of the Com-mittee on Finance who worked day inand day out to try to give this measurea chance, to try to perfect it, and to putin modifications of the kind the Gover-nors' conference wanted. Unfortunatelywe were on the losing side when wesought to add the measure as an amend-ment to the pending bill.I might say further that at the timethe vote was taken in committee theunderstanding was that, If it were addedto the pending bill, the committee duringthe next several days would have an op-portunity to go over It paragraph byparagraph and to work some modifica-tions into it. We never had that chance.So when this amendment was beingtalked about as prospective legislationto the social security bill during debatebefore the full Senate a good many ofus hoped it would be offered in a man-ner which would enable us to offer moth-fications to it by way of amendment. Butthose who promoted this amendment.saw fit, for their own best reasons, notto put it before the Senate that way andto use a parliamentary device, legitimatethough it may be, under which the Sen-ate cannot do a thing about it exceptvote it up or down.Mr. President, this is too important ameasure to be put before the Senate onsuch a simplistic basis. The Senate is farmore sophisticated than that. Welfarerecipients are deserving of far bettertreatment than that. Those paying thebill, the taxpayers, are deserving of farbetter treatment than that.I think the chairman has well gagedthe temper of the Senate by stating thatif this is going to be the way it will behandled, we are not going to get a voteon it, so let us get on about our busi-ness and preserve what can be pre-served, and then we will hope we can dosomething about the welfare packagenext year.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, will theSenator yield?Mr. MILLER. I yield.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, I am surethe Senator heard the statement madeby the able Senator from Connecticut,as I did, that the President, the chair-man of the Committee on Ways andMeans in the House, and the rankingmember, have Indicated that if this billdies, they would send us early next yeara social security bill seeking to makepayments retroactive to January 1.It is well to point out that if this billshould pass, even this will be retroactive,because beneficiaries would get their in-creases on April 1.If the Senate does not pass this billand the House sends us a new bill nextyear, there is no reason why Senatorswho are trying to do something aboutjobs In their States would not offer atrade amendment on that bill, or whythat bill might not become involved ina controversial family assistance plan,again modified, and by the time thatbattle is finished in the Halls of Con-gress it might be August before thosepeople get checks, retroactive thoughthey may be. They would be another .5or 6 months waiting for something torhjch they are rightfully entitled.Furthermore, some of those people willdie between January and August, withthe result that those people never wouldget the increase to which they are en-titled.So I would say to the Senator thatwhen one looks at the facts of life thatexist today, what is practical and can bedone, if the Senate Insists on continu-ing to tie up this bill with trade legis-lation and a family assistance plan, asocial security bill will not become lawthis year. If Senators are determined tohave their way about family assistanceand trade legislation, there Is no reason S 21220 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEDecember 28, 1970to think the same determination will notprevail In the next Congress, with theresult that Senators could be equally asadamant, so the bill might not becomelaw next year.Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, the Sen-ator made a very valid point. He mighthave gone further and pointed out, apartfrom the things he has been discussing,that the Committee on Finance, aftermany long days, made some real andconstructive improvements in the medi-care and medicaid provisions and old-ageassistance provisions; and if these arescuttled they will not take effect for sometime. These are the kinds of changesthat should take effect \"yesterday.\" Thatwill be delayed also.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, will theSenator yield?Mr. MILLER. I yield.Mr. LONG. Is it not true that the Rihi-coff -Bennett amendment, pending at thedesk, does not go into effect as far asany beneficiary is concerned, until Janu-ary 1972, anyway; and as far as the 14million people it would add to the wel-fare rolls, they do not start getting thosebenefits until July of 1972; and there isnothing to keep Congress from passingit during the 18 months between now andthe time the beneficiaries would get thosechecks?Mr. MILLER. The Senator is correct,but in fairness I should respond by point-ing out we all know it will take probably1 year for the department to crank upthe machinery necessary to put a far-reaching welfare reform plan into effect.In fact, this is one reason why the Sen-ator from Connecticut was very ada-mant about a pilot testing program, be-cause such a program could isolate somedefects, not only in administration, butalso defects, perhaps, in the law, whichwould enable us to take some action onthis before it went into effect finally.I think the Senator's real point Is thatthere is more of an immediacy problemIn social security, medicare, medicaid,and old age assistance than a welfare re-form program which will not take effectuntil January 1, 1972, at the earliest.Mr. RIBICOFF. Mr. President, will theSenator yield?Mr. MILLER. I yield to the Senatorfrom Connecticut.Mr. RIBICOFF. Mr. President, I askedthe Senator to yield so I could reply toour distinguished chairman instead of apoint raised by my distinguished col-league from Iowa.The chairman is correct that there isnothing to prevent those interested intradelegislationfromplacingan amendment in the social security bill orthe family assistance program.I am deeply bothered that we havetied together so many programs in onebill. In all candor, there is not a singleprogram in this huge bill that legiti-mately does not deserve extensive debatethat would extend over 2, 3, or 4 weeks,because they are all complex matters.But the family assistance program wasbefore us for 16 months; it passed theHouse, as the trade bill passed the House,but we had full hearings on family as-sistance before the Committee on Fi-nance. When it came to trade we hadhearings that lasted 2 days. Trade Is avery important factor in our Nation. Ibelieve those interested in trade legis-lation should have a full set of hearings.A trade bill legitimately should comefrom the Committee on Finance, stand-ing by itself. It should be given earlypriority, just as the family assistanceprogram should be given early priority.And I wonder if the time has not cometo consider the rule of germaneness, in-stead of making it possible to put everypossible amendment onto every piece oflegislation.One of the great tragedies that hastaken place in the last few weeks in thisbody is that we as a body have shown ourcomplete impotence to take care of prob-lems that a democracy must deal with.Here we are as alegislative body goingtoward the 21st century with the rulesand regulations and procedures of the19th century. We are acting in the Sen-ate today as if this were the age of DanielWebster, at a time when problems keeppushing against us for solution and everyinstitution in the world is under attackand every institution is being pushed forchange. Whether such institutions liveordie depends on whether those in charge of the institutions have the in-telligence and foresight to understandthe changes that they themselves mustput into effect to assure that our institu-tions live. At a time when our institutions,when our Government, when corpora-tions, when labor unions, when universi-ties are being pushed for changes, thereis no reason for us to sit here in oursmugness and think that, because wehave done things a certain way for 150years, that is good enough for the future.There is much soul-searching to bedone by us. This is an institution whichhas proven its value, but if this body of100 men and women are unable to under-stand each other and the great changesbeing faced by the United States and theworld, we are dealing a blow to our pre-cious heritage of free government. TheSenate is a great Institution. But it willnot stay great and it will not be great ifwe continue to do in the future as wehave done in the past month.Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, I mightadd just a footnote to what the Senatorfrom Connecticut has so eloquently said,and that is that if we are going to makea change in the rules, one of them shouldbe in a rule which prohibits a majorpiece of legislation, such as the one weare now considering, frQm having onesingle amendment filed to it. I would suggest there are those who might re-frain from following that rule, but if itwere a rule, it would be a rule which waslegal, and I would like to see the presentrule changed. So if we are going to makesome changes, let us make changes acrossthe board, instead of making one changehere or there.Mr. RJBICOFF. Mr. President, will theSenator yield?Mr. MILLER. I promised to yield tothe Senator from Vermont (Mr. AIICEN).I will yield to the Senator from Con-necticut later.Mr. AIKEN. Mr. President, I wouldlike to see most of the Senate version ofH.R. 17550 enacted into law, and I wouldvote for most of It. I would vote for theRibicoff-Bennett amendment ifI had had the chance and felt that by approv-ing those provisions we were not killingthe whole bill,However, I believe that if we under-took to act on the whole bill now wewould not accomplish any of it. There isno possibility of its becoming law, andevery one of us here knows that. I do notwant to go home and face the people,many of whom depend almost whollyupon their social security checks. I donot want to go home and face those.people who are so dependent and sohelped by the medicare law, or would behelped by the medicare amendment pro-posed. and tell them that I voted to killtheir social security increase and theirincreased benefits from medicare becauseI could not get everything I wanted. Ithink that would be a pretty shamefulthing to do.So I am going to vote for the Longmotion, although, as I have said, I wouldlike other parts of the bill. We are com-ing back into a new session some timenext month and will have a chance to acton these other sections of the bill then.But I certainly hope we do not have to gohome now and tell these people who aredependent uponsocialsecurityand medicare that we turned our backs onthem because we could not be big shotsand get everything we wanted at thissession.Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, I yield tothe Senator from New York (Mr. JAvITs).Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I appre-ciate the sincerity and the truth of whatthe Senator from Connecticut (Mr. RIBI-coFF) said to the Senate a few minutesago, but I do think a few points should betouched on as to what faces us, and oneis the key place of the so-called ruleXXII controversy, which will break outagain in January, and, second, the keyplace of the administration In everythingthat is happening here.On the first, with respect to rule XXII,I agree with the Senator from Connecti-cut that if rule XXII Is not changed, weare governed by a two-thirds vote, andnot by a majority vote, and until we aregoverned by majority vote, with reason-able opportunity for debate, we will runinto these roadblocks. Not very often.but on occasion I have used the provi-sions of rule XXII, That is symptomaticand characteristic of the fact that thereform will have to be a basic reform, areform of the rules which we will all ac-cept. With others, I will be one of theprime movers In January to reform ruleXXII. I rose only to emphasize the keypart of the rule. We modified it once.Obviously it was not enough. It was oneof the reasons why I joined others in thisprocedure, although I began to doubtwhether we should keep on the same oldtrack, In the plan to challenge the exist-ing rule XXII, which we will again try tochange in January.As to the administration, I hope verymuch the administration will play itspart in the next few days. We need toknow whether the administration willaccept an assurance that FAP will be oneof the first matters considered in thenext session. We need to know whetherthe administration agrees with me, withthe Senator from Connecticut (Mr. RIBI- December 28, 1970corr), and others, that It is a great mis-take to discuss this trade Issue, on whichpeople like myself may well get licked. Igive the Senate my assurance that in thenew session we will make no effort suchas we are making now with respect tothe consideration of the bill. If the coun-try, after an opportunity to talk it outand hear it out in terms of hearings,wants quotas, then I certainly will notbe so un-American as to put myself inthe position of thwarting its will, al-thcugh I think my country would bemaking a great mistake.So I hope we can come to an accom-modation, not only on our part, but onthe part of the President who has a veryimportant part to play here.If the Senator from Iowa (Mr. MILLER)will indulge me 1 minute further, I callmy colleagues' attention to the fact thatthe New York Times, which has not beenoverly kind to the Republican adminis-tration, as we all know, neverthelesswrote an editorial the other day pointingout that the lameduck session, much toits surprise, and to mine, had accom-plished some good, such as enactment ofthe broker-dealer bill which is criticallyimportant to the security of our country.I ask unanimous consent that theeditorial be printed at this point in theRECORD.There being no objection, the editorialwas ordered to be printed in the RECORD,as follows:THELIVELYDVcKThe unusual post-election session of Con-gress was expected to be a lame duck, but ithas proved much more lively than lame. Theproductivity of both houses has been ob-scured by the spectacular impasse which theSenate Finance Committee created when Itmerged several unrelated bills into one hugeunmanageable package.In the last month, Congress has enactedor reached virtually final action on nearlya dozen significant measures. The Housingbill Is considerably more ambitious than theNixon Administration desired this year andits new provisions for the financing of newtowns may have considerable impact on thisnation's future urban growth.The Occupational Health and Safety BillIs an unexpected triumph for the House-Senate conference committee system whichhas been the subject of much justifiable criti-cism of late. Only the sunniest optimistsreally expected a bill to pass this year. Butafter several arduous sessions with Adminis-tration, trade union and industry lobbyistshovering about, the conferees reached com-promises on several bitterly contested Issues.For the first time, workers can now look for-ward to effective, federally enforced safetyand health standards where they work.The manpower blU which President Nixonunwisely vetoed is another significant ac-complishment. As almost any Mayor couldtell the President, there Is no alternative tofederally financed public service jobs to meetthe double crunch of rising unemploymentand unbalanced municipal budgets. It is dif-ficult to reconcile Mr. Nixon's veto attack ondead-end WPA-type jobs with his solicitudefor the survival of financially shaky aero-spacecompanies.Apparently,one man's Lockheed is another man's leaf-raking.The House and Senate also reached agree-ment last week on the Air Pollution BiU withits stringent requirement of a pollution-freeautomobile by 1975 and its tough standardsfor new power plants and manufacturingplants.Until recently, Congress's recent approvalof a sizable Federal program to aeIst famIlyCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEplanning would have been regarded as abreathtaking accomplishment. It Is highlysignificant that population control has nowceased to be politically controversial. Con-grss in the last several days has also com-pleted action on bills to Insure the broker-age accounts of small Investors, extend aidto the bankrupt Penn Central Raillroad, Im-prove the law-enforcement assistance provi-sions of the Crime Control Act of 1968, andamend the food stamp plan.Only the food stamp bill remains in doubt.Representative Poage, Texas Democrat, andhis conservative colleagues on the HouseAgriculture Committee finally made somesubstantial concessions on their atrociousbill, although it remains inferior to the com-passionate, constructive bill put through theSenate by Senator McGovern. Forty yearsafter the Great Depression began, the mostdurable illusion Ia Congress is that povertyis due to an Individual's moral failings. Noamount of government coercion or food stamp blackmail can make men work whoeither cannot or will not work.Yet if this lame-duck session has steppedlively and accomplished more than mighthave been predicted six weeks ago, the fail-ure of the Senate to overcome the irrespon-sibility of its Finance Committee casts a darkshadow over the session and, Indeed, overthe good repute of representative govern-ment in this country. Whatever the fatenext week of the welfare reform or the Im-port quota bill, the Senate leadership in thenew Congress has to look squarely at thisproblem and seek effective answers, whetherthey be revised procedures In the Senate ornew members on the Finance Committeeor both.Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, other things can happen, as the Senator fromVermont pointed out, If we give them achance. So, in spite of my deep feelingfor PAP, I, too, am beginning to havethe feeling that I shall vote for the mo-tion in order to do something instead ofaccepting the certainty that we can donothing. But, in order to do it and makeit successful and make it whole to theAmerican people, I feel the administra-tion must play a part, and I hope verymuch it will.I thalik my colleagues very much.Mr. HOLLAND. Mr. President, will theSenator yield?Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, may I justmake a comment to the Senator fromNew York?Mr. JAVITS. I yield to the Senatorfrom Iowa.Mr. MILLER. I know that the Senatorfrom New York feels very strongly aboutrule XXII and the need for a change.Perhaps I did not quite accurately hearwhat he said, but I gained the impressionthat he might be suggesting that ruleXXII is un-American.There are a good many Members of theSenate who feel very strongly about ruleXXII, who also feel very strongly aboutmajority rule. Of course, we all knowthat a mere simple majority of 51 Sena-tors here in the U.S. Senate may well notreflect more than about a third of thepeople of this country\u2014perhaps only 25percent. If we are really interested in themoat important majority, which perhapsis the majority of the people of this coun-try, we might find 18 Senators who couldstand here and represent the majority ofthe people of the United States; but Ido not think moat of us would wantthem to decide issues In the Senate.S 21221It seems to me that rule XXII hasweathered the storms over the years. Iknow when I first came to the Senate,and we invoked cloture, I think it wasin 1961, that was the first time in about35 years that the Senate had invokedcloture. But in the last 10 years we haveinvoked cloture nine or 10 times. So thatshows that when there are really impor-tant measures, and especially if they have bipartisan support, we can get thejob done when the time comes.The Senator from New York wellknows that every time he files an amend-ment to rule XXII, he always finds anamendment to his amendment filed bythe Senator from Iowa, agreeing to achange to three-fifths of the Senators,provided that a majority of the Mem-bers on both sides of the aisle havejoined in it. The reason, of course, is sothat a ruthless majority will not be ableto choke off debate by the minority.I would like to see a change in thecloture rule, but it would have to be cou-pled with that proviso. I would suggestto my friend from New York that,strongly though he may feel about achange and the need for a change in ruleXXII, we have some colleagues who donot want any change at all, and I donot think we should attribute to themany less love of the Senate and love ofour country than we ourselves share.Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, will theSenator yield 'for a clarification?Mr. MILLER. I yield.Mr. JAVITS. I did not apply the word\"un-American\" to rule XXII, or to any-one who believes in It, which I do not.The proper word is really \"irrelevant.\"Ihappened to apply it in terms of my ownfeeling that to block arbitrarily a vote,even on trade quotas, which I thinkwould be a disaster to our country, wouldin my judgment be against the nationalinterest in trying to get things done.What is relevant to .rule XXII is thatno proposal that I know of, including theone which, with the Senator from Mich-igan (Mr. HART), I espouse, the so-calledDouglas clinch, does not have a provi-sion that before cloture on anythingthere be a minimum of 4 weeks' debate,and up to 6 weeks' debate.It seems to me that if we want to getthings done, ultimately, after debate,elucidation, education, and public discus-sion, we must come to a vote. That is therule that is hamstringing us in terms ofgetting the public business done. Thatis all I said.Certainly no Senator has a right tomake a moral judgment as to whetherthis or that is un-American. Calhoun feltthat the idea of a concurrent majoritywas essential to the future of our coun-try, and had I been in the Senate then,I would not have considered him Un-American. This was his considered bestjudgment as to what was In the highestand best Interests of our land. I granthim or any other Senator full moralequality with myself as to judging whatis best for our land.I do not feel that any Senator whofavors the filibuster rule is un-Americanor against American tradition, or any-thing like that.Mr. MILLER. I appreciate the clarifi-cation. I ask the Senator, Is not what he S 21222 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEDecember 28, 1970is really saying this: That with the shorttime remaining for the Senate betweennow and the last day of this Congress, itwould be, to use his language, against thebest interest of the country to be arbi-trary?Mr. JAVITS. That is correct.Mr. MILLER. And he indicated thatafter we had time, which we will haveearly next year, to debate this matterat great length and analyze it forwardand backward, then, but not until then,we would be able to say we had not actedarbitrarily?Mr. JAVITS. That is exactly right.And, for example, to add just one word,Brimmer of the Federal Reserve gives usfigures as to what it will cost the con-sumers of this country to put quotas onfoods and textiles. No one here has beenable to test those figures either up, down,or sideways, except in the most cursoryand on-the-surface manner, because wesimply have not had the time and oppor-tunity to do it in depth.Mr. HOLLAND. Mr. President, wifi theSenator yield to me?Mr. MILLER. I yield to the Senatorfrom Florida.Mr. HOLLAND. I thank the Senator,and compliment him as well as the Sen-ator from New York, because I, too, agree that what we have to consider now,with the very short time remaining, ishow to get worthwhile things done; andthat is what should occupy the atten-tion and time of the Senate during thefew days and hours remaining.I am not going to talk about rule XXII.I think the Senate knows how I feel aboutit, and yet I doubt if many Senators re-member that a number of years ago Isuggested on this floor that rule XXII notbe applied to defense measures, and thata simple majority be permitted to bringdebate to a close with reference to mat-ters vital to the Nation's defense.But, Mr. President, to come back tothe motion of the junior Senator fromLouisiana, the Senator will remember,though I cannot go into the details ofour \u00f4losed session of some 2 or 3 weeksago, that the Senator from Florida theilmade substantially the same suggestionas has now been made by the Senatorfrom Louisiana. Of course, I agree withhim, and, of course, I shall vote with him.I think that the thing we should do isrecommit this overburdened legislation\u2014overburdened by amendments\u2014back tohis committee, with adequate instruc-tions to report it, so that an immediateconference can be held with the Houseof Representatives, and particularly sothat the much-needed increases to therecipients of social security can speedilygo into effect.I am told there are something like 26million recipients of social security. SomeSenators spoke of the need of doing some-thing for all the States. I cannot thinkof anything which would help the peoplein every State\u2014thousands and thousandsof them, even in our smaller States\u2014toa greater degree than to help them outsomewhat through the improvement oftheir social security payments.So I commend the Senator from Loui-siana, and I shall support his motion.Mr. President, while not saying any-thing adverse about the amendment ofthe Senator from Connecticut, I call at-tention to the fact that It is 139 pageslong, and I call attention also to the factthat the distinguished senior Senatorfrom Delaware has pointed out obviousdefects in it, which cannot be reachedunder the parliamentary situation.I was an original sponsor of the tradeamendment in the form of a separatebill, offered by the Senator from SouthCarolina (Mr. HOLLINGS) and others. Iam interested in that amendment. ButI think that, putting first things first,the motion of the Senator from Loui-siana for recommittal with instructionsshould be agreed to, and I think that therecord ought to be perfectly clear nowas to who it Is,if anyone, that will holdup payments to the recipients of socialsecurity in the increased amounts thatthe social security portion of this billprovides.It will not be the Senator from Louisi-ana. It will not be those who supporthis motion. It will not be those who wantto support his motion if no vote is per-mitted because of lengthy discussion. Itwill be those who, by one means or an-other, oppose the motion of the Senatorfrom Louisiana. The Senator from Flor-ida stands ready to support it and thento support the shortened bill when Itcomes back, so that it can go to an im-mediate conference, and he hopes thatthe Senate will do just that. It is theonly way we are going to get somethingdone which is of immense importanceto 26 million American citizens, many ofwhom are living under circumstances inwhich they need more money simply tolive, simply to exist.The Senator from Florida commendshisdistinguished friend,the Senatorfrom Louisiana, on his motion, and hopesthat Senators will permit it to be votedupon shortly, and that we shall thenmove ahead along the course suggestedby the Senator from Louisiana.I thank the distinguished Senator foryielding. I simply wanted to support himin his position and also to support thatpart of the statement made by the Sen-ator from New York in which he madeit clear that if we are to get anythingdone, that is the only way we are goingto get it done.I thank the Senator for yielding.Mr. MILLER. I appreciate the com-ments of the distinguished Senator fromFlorida. As usual, he has cut to the heartof the problem and has done his level bestto get on with the business of the Senate.Had it not been for him, I am afraid wewould not have gotten to the business ofthe Senate on a great many previous oc-casions.Mr. President, I yield the floor.Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I havebeen listening to the debate for the lasthour or so, and I still find that those whoare expressing sympathy for the proposalthat has been put forth by the dis-tinguished Senator from Delaware andthe distinguished Senator from Louisi-ana, in terms of effectively stripping allthe provisions of this bill, with the ex-ception of social security, are singularlyunconvincing.I think the arguments of the distin-guished Senator from Connecticut stillremain. It is a fIne hour, when everyonestands up here and talks about the im-portance of increasing social security.There is not a Member of the Senate whohas not understood that for the last yearor the last 2 years. Suddenly, In the finalfew hours of this Congress, they say, \"Weknow what has to be done; we have totake care of the social security recipi-ents,\" and therefore try to say, \"If youdon't vote for this, you're really againstthose who need social security.\" In effect,that is what is attempted to be done.The Senator from Connecticut haspointed out\u2014and I must say it has beenInteresting, because with the exceptionof himself, and sometimes the participa-tion of the Senator from Utah (Mr.BENNETT) and the distinguished Senatorfrom Oklahoma (Mr. HARRIS), only a fewvoices have been raised by the President'sown party In defense of this proposal. Imight add that the President deservescredit for that proposal because thereis a great need for it.We perpetrate a fraud upon the Amer-ican people by suggesting that we will notact and act responsibly to increase socialsecurity, or that we cannot do so or willnot do so In the next session of Con-gress. The fact remains that I think wehave a responsibility and an obligationto act on the President's program onfamily assistance. I do not think it is per-suasive to say, \"We are not really gettingInto the question of whether it will be-come law. We do not have to take state-ments made by the members of the op-posite party that suggest we are not go-ing to act.\" This body has a responsibilhyto act on this matter. We can wrestlearound here all hours of the day andnight listeningto the parliamentarygymnastics of our good friend, the Sena-tor from Delaware, and other differentproposals, always expounding the thesisthat they are ready to vote; but as weknow, the fact remains that they are notready to vote. It is an obstructionist tac-tic, and we are denying our responsibilityto the American people in not being ableto act.It is as clear and precise as that, Mr.President; and I think the Senator fromConnecticut has pointed this up verywell, not only in his comments this after-noon but throughout the debate on thisissue over the past weeks.I would hope that those who are in theWhite House, who have threatened tocall Congress back on January 4, wouldinstead use their influenceto try to marshal the kind of support for the votesto see whether we can find some way tomeet our responsibility to the millions ofAmericans who are living in the mostdestitute conditions and are crying outfor some kind of help and assistance.I ask the distinguished Senator fromConnecticut, is It not true that, in effect,if this family assistance program is killed,under the amendments that have beentaken by the Finance Committee, we willbe thrown back to some punitive and de-grading features in the welfare system\u2014for example, the residency requirement,and the man-in-the-house rule?Mr. RIBICOFF. The Senator is correct.I was under the impression that thechairman struck out those provisions ofthe bill that had to do completely withwelfare, but this is not so. December 28, 1970Mr. LONG. Mr. President, will theSenator yield?Mr. KENNEDY. I yield.Mr. LONG. This motion does not strikewhat the committee proposed to do withregard to residency requirements.The committee proposal with regardto the residency requirement would saythat the State from which the welfarerecipient isreceiving welfare benefitswould continue to pay him for 1 yearafter he leaves that State, during whichtime he would acquire residency to havebenefits paid by the subsequent State.The Senator will note that the num-ber of people receiving AFDC assistanceincreased sharplyafter the SupremeCourt decision on residency and the man-in-the-house rule.I suspect that theSenator will find that a great many ofthose people are on the welfare rollstwice\u2014once in one State and once Inanother.Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as Iunderstand\u2014Mr. RIBICOFF. The Senator is cor-rect. I was under the impression thatwhat the Senator was doing was strikingout all but the social security provisions,and the argument was that we were go-Ing to make sure that 26 million Ameri-cans were going to get the social securityprovisions. But, apparently, the Senatorhas not done this. He is putting up to avote, eventually, the most retrogressive,the most reactionary, the most punitivetype of welfare legislation in the entirehistory of the country, and it Is a dis-service to the U.S. Senate; because Ithink most of us, including myself\u2014andI thank the Senator for bringing it to ourattention\u2014were under the impressionthat what was being done was merelygiving us an opportunity to vote on socialsecurity, which apparently is not thecase.Mr. KENNEDY. Furthermore, wouldthe Senator from Connecticut enlightenme on this: Are not these the provisionsabout which the Supreme Court has ex-pressed an opinion In terms of theirconstitutionality or their basis in law?Mr. RIBICOFF. Certainly.Mr. KENNEDY. So, in effect, we notonly are stripping away all these otherprovisions, but also, we would be gettingthe reprehensible features which theSenator from Connecticut has just iden-tified.Mr. RIBICOFF. The Senator is correct.The Supreme Court of the United Statesstruck down both the man-in-the-houserule and the residency requirements. Bysome legerdemain, the Finance Commit-tee wrote In, by a change of language,restrictions trying to avoid the SupremeCourt decisions. I would be shocked andsurprised if the Supreme Court wouldsustain the action of the Finance Corn-inittee, which, In my opinion, is just aswrong as the provisions stricken down bythe Supreme Court of the United States.Mr. KENNEDY. Willthe Senatoragree with me that if we were to votefor the proposal to strip these other pro-visions from the bill, In effect, we wouldbe taking some kind of action that wouldshow almost tacit approval?Mr. RIBICOFF. Without question.But, in fact, I believe that a majority ofthe Senate is filled with compassion. Ibelieve that a majority of the Senatewants justice to be done to the poor ofour Nation. What we would be doingunder the guise of helping people onsocial security would be to punish mil-lions of Americans without their knowl-edge. That is what we would be doingby this action.Mr. KENNEDY.It would certainlyappear to me that by this action theentire membership of our party shouldhave a fair knowledge in their ownminds of what we are doing. As I men-tioned before, I do not think we have tohear time and time again about the needfor social security. Everyone knows thereis a great need for it and we should acton it. We are willing to, and we must acton it. But also, as the distinguishedSenator from Connecticut has pointedout, we would be instituting the kindsof adjustments and changes which Ithink are unconstitutional and which Ifeel are reprehensible and which I thinkwould be doing a great disservice andcomplicating further the already terriblycomplicated welfare program.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, I suggestthat the Senator consult the Parliamen-tarian about the motion to recommit.Everything that Is germane to that partof thebill would remain subject to amendment. Any Senator can make hismotion to strike out or to amend any-thing that remains in the bill. The mo-tion to recommit was, made in order toput the bill In such a shape that it couldbe passed. If the Senator does not like aprovision, such as the residency require-ment provision, all he has to do Is moveto strike or to amend it.But now we have been debating fordays on the trade amendment, and onthe family assistance amendment. Weare still debating an amendment to thefirst amendment which is an amend-ment to the trade amendment aild wewill never conclude debate. We will reachadjournment without any action. This isthe 28th day of December, and 1 daybetween now and the time we adjournis Sunday, which means that we haveonly 5 days during which the Senatecan act, and that is assuming we canarrive at an agreement between Houseand Senate, and then agree to what theconferees have done.It would be my hope that if this mo-tion is agreed to we could get a timelimitation on the various amendments.We could get a limitation of 1 hour to beequally divided, perhaps, or if a Sena-tor wants to pick out some particularamendment he does not like, we couldmake it 1 or 2 hours, and provide timeon each amendment and vote on themand bring the matter to a conclusion.I am satisfied that positions on thetrade amendment are such that we willnot reach a vote on the trade bill, nor onthe family assistance program. There-fore, we should try to see that as much aswe can be done is done to provide thesebenefits for the people.The Senator mentions that we did notstrip this bill to titles 1 and 2. I wouldhope that we would not want to take outall the good what Is in the other titles ofthe bill, a,ll that we provide for little chil-S 21223dren, such as the increased matching forday care purposes from 80 to 90 percent.I would hope that we would not strike outwhat the bill provides for the aged, suchas the minimum of a $130 income for theaged on public welfare, If they have noother resources. I hope the Senator is notagainst that, or what we provide for withregard to. migrant workers, the bill re-quires States to have a program with 75-percent Federal matching for the ex-penses of caring for migrant familieswith children. I hope he is not againstthat. I am sure that he would be for it.There are many other things whichare good in this bill and they should bevoted on. There are some things weshould do to tighten up on the welfaremess. For that is what ItIs, a welfaremess. A majority of people who talkabout welfare call it that. Among otherthings the mess means that we have mil-lions of people on welfare who do notbelong there.A woman in Louisiana was recently ar-rested. She was on the welfare rolls fourtimes and was applying a fifth time whenshe was arrested. There was a younggirl in California, who was a member ofwhat is called \"Cheaters, Incorporated,\"I believe, and she had gotten on the wel-fare rolls 10 times in Alameda just toshow how easy it was, and she was noteligible at aU. These kinds of thingsshould be corrected somehow. Some ef-fort was made by this committee to tryto do something about these things.The Senator says the residency re-quirement is vicious. Well, whatever theSenate wants to do is all right with me.What we said on the committee wasthat it was all right to be on the rollsjust one time, and in one State, but ifthey leave from one State and go to an-other, then the State from whence theycame would pay for another year untilthey had achieved a residency require-ment in the other State.The General Accounting Office took asample of 600 cases In New York andsome 14 percent of these were totallyunqualified. Even New York itself agreedthat 11 percent were not qualified, andthat they should be looked into. That iswhat, from the viewpoint of a lot of peo-ple, is meant by the welfare mess. Thereare millions on the welfare rolls whodo not belong there and the only way tocorrect it is to put only those on whobelong there.I hope that we can do all the thingsthe bill seeks to accomplish; that is, tohelp the 26 million people who need so-cial security, and to provide for migrantworkers, and to provide for children andday care centers, and to help the oldpeople of this country. All these thingsshould be done.I am frank to say that I do not thinkany responsible committee looking at thewelfare mess would fail to note that thereare many people on welfare who haveno real claim, title, or justification forbeing there. Nor do I think a responsiblecommittee would want fathers whodesert their children to be free fromsupporting their children.As to the Federal court decisions, onedecision says that we cannot even insistCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATE S 21224 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEDecember 28, 1970that the mother tell us who is the fatherof her child.Mr. TALMADGE. If the Senator willlet me interject there, there is anothercourt decision where the welfare investi-gator cannot even go into the home toinvestigate the family status.Mr. LONG. That is correct. Imaginethat. Here is the court telling us thatUncle Sam has to support the child, yetthe mother can refuse even to tell us whoshe thinks the father of the child mightbe.I believe that, as a part of correctingthis welfare mess, we should tighten upon the loose ends and perhaps loosenup on the tight ends. We can do a lotbetter by putting people on the rolls whobelong there and taking those people offwho do not belong there.In anyevent,if there is anything theSenate does not like about this bill, they can vote on it, and that will bethat.Mr. SCOTI'. If the Senator would yieldme a moment, because I have not takenmy share of this debate yet, and someSenators have been overburdened withthe responsibility, I would like to say inresponse to my friend, the assistant ma-jority leader, that I would not worryabout the blame for the delays. Thereis plenty of blame to go around for every-one. Everyone can dip in and have some,because the reason we have taken solong and the reason we have not beenable to act is due to a multiplicity offears and the many concerns among vari-ous Senators, some so-called free tradeSenators who are determined not to letthis matter get to a vote for fear sometrade legislation will get in It.Other Senators have an interest intextiles, but not in shoes, or in shoes butnot in textiles. Some do not care whetherthey wear anything or walk in anythingwhatsoever.There are some that do not want thefamily assistance program. There areothers who do.Some Senators want social security inits pristine and virginal form as it leftthe committee\u2014if that was a virginalform, which I must doubt; Other Sena-tors wish to make certain amendments.The Senator from Massachusetts andI, I believe, will vote the same way onthis amendment. We will vote against re-committal to strip the family assistanceprogram from the bill.I would like to see It there.We are confronted with a conditionand not a theory. The condition Is thatwe are not getting anywhere. The theoryIs that we wish we would, but we have100 different opinions on the matter.We are worse off than the characterdescribed by the late Stephen Leacockwho got on his horse and galloped off Inseven different directions.I think It is not necessary to say thatone Senator is holding up the bill. In myjudgment, everyone Is holding everyoneelse up.The Senate, Instead of Increasing thelevel of Its edifice In the public regard, Isengaged in holding up each other andmysteriously\u2014perhaps not so mysteri-ously\u2014lowering its edifice In the publicmind.The Senate Is in a mess. it is aboutto vote on a motion to recommit whichprobably will pass. When it does, we willgo on to the matter of social securityand decide whether we will accept thatmeasure or not.Mr. President, I hope that, should thiscome down to a point where we can dis-cuss only social security and its amend-ments, we will adopt and accept it andsend to the other body\u2014if we can findthem\u2014a workable bill. I think that weshall have to hurry because the storiesare that the other body Is in a mood tobe rather peripatetic by tomorrow night.While they cannot adjourn without us,they can leave without us. We are hay-Ing trouble getting a quorum, or willhave. Therefore, I would hope that themotion to recommit would not pass. Myown judgment tells me that it probablywill. If It does, let us at least get asmuch business done as we can. But, moreimportant than anything else,let us have, before we drop this bill, an assur-ance from the chairman and the rankingminority member of the Ways and MeansCommittee of the other body that theywill bring it up promptly in the begin-ning of the next session and act promptlyon it and send It over here.I would then hope that the majorityleader and I could deliver certain assur-ances to this body which I have not hada chance as yet to discuss with him.However, he is on his horse and will behere in a few minutes. I hear the gallopof approaching hooves at the moment. Ithink that we will be able to make somestatement about the matter.Mr. President. last year, on the floor ofthis Senate, I had the privilege of intro-ducing the Family Assistance Act of 1969(5. 2986). At the time, I noted that\"This bill constitutes one of the mostimportant domestic initiatives which theNixon administration will undertake,\"and that it was vitally essential to thesuccessful implementation of the Presi-dent's stated goal, to \"assist millions ofAmericans out of poverty and into pro-ductivity.\"Nothing that has happened during theIntervening 14 months\u2014none of the tes-timony offered during committee hear-ings or the seemingly endless spate ofwords that have been written about thislegislation\u2014has caused me to alter myposition. On the contrary, I am moreconvinced than ever that a completeoverhaul of our welfare system Is longoverdue.The family assistance plan is the vehi-cle through which this can be accom-plished. It represents an idea whose timehas come.Our present welfare system is collaps-ing of its own weight. Only within thepast decade, the cost of the program ofaid to families with dependent chil-dren\u2014AFDC\u2014hastripledwhilethe number of recipients has doubled. Andyet, In spite of our largess, there Is noend in sight.In my own State of Pennsylvania, Inthe 1-year period from April 1969 toApril 1970, there was a 23.7 percent In-crease In the number of AFDC recipientsand a 51.9 percent increase In the amountof payments. Where will It all end?Worse, still, inequities built into thesystem continue unabated. How can wejustify a program in which the Stateof residence Is a more important crite-rion than the state of need in determiningthe level of benefits?What we have today is a program im-possible to administer equitably, whichimposes an increasingly heavy financialburden upon the taxpayer, and whichdoes not do the job it was designed to doin the first place.We have long since passed the timewhen anyone would suggest that a so-lution to the welfare problem lies inmaking assistance difficult to get and un-pleasant to take. But it appears thatunconsciously, at least, this is exactlywhat we are doing. Unlike the quality ofmercy that blesses both the one whogives and the one who receives, publicwelfare today demeans both.The present welfare system, designedas a temporary expedient, emerged fromthe depression of the thirties to cope withthe problems of the thirties. It is ananachronism that should long since havebeen laid to rest.It was established as an optional Stateprogram to provide assistance to specificcategories of the financially indigent\u2014the blind, the disabled, the aged, and de-pendent children and their guardians.Initially, able-bodied male workers werenot eligible for assistance.Despite the fact that large-scale un-employment, such as was witnessed inthe thirties, Is not an issue today, thepoor are still with us. Moreover, not-withstanding our substantial economicgrowth, we now accept the fact that therewill always be poverty and unemploy-ment even in the midst of plenty. Evenin 1968, a good year in terms of employ-ment opportunities, monthly unemploy-.ment averaged 2.8 million workers.The program of aid to families withdependent children, to which I previouslyreferred, was designed primarily for families in which the father was absentorincapacitated.Ithassincebeen amended to provide, at the State's op-tion, assistance to families with unem-ployed fathers. However, only half theStates have exercised this option. Theresult is that some families receive morefrom AFDC benefits than families headedby employable men receive from earn-ings.The net effect has been to encouragethe breakup of families in order that theymight qualify for public assistance. Ifever a program ran counter to the intentof those who enacted it as well as thosecharged with administering it, this Is It.It is completely indefensible.What we have created, in effect, is atwo-headed monster which, on the onehand, encourages family breakup and, onthe other, penalizes those who work. Ihave yet to hear a satisfactory explana-tion of why income from employmentand receipt of public assistance shouldbe mutually exclusive.Our present hodgepodge of welfaresystems also suffers from a lack of uni-formity. Welfare programs are actuallyState programs that receive Federalmatching funds and operate within looseFederal guidelines. The not surprising. December 28, 1970result Is that systems differ from State toState in such essential features as cover-age, benefits, and administrative prac-tices.With all of these negative features, Itis a wonder that the program has sur-vived this long. But there have been twofactors working in favor of the statusquo\u2014inertia and the lack of innovative,vi able alternative which goes to the heartof the problem instead of treating thesymptoms.We now have for our considerationwhat has aptly been termed the mostinnovative social legislation of the past30 years. All we have left to contend withis our inertia.Some mayjustifiablyarguethat change is not necessarily progress\u2014andwith that philosophy I must agree. Butlet us look at what the legislation doescontain.The family assistance plan now beforethe Senate calls for payments to all I am-ilies with children having Incomes belowstipulated amounts. At the same time, Itencourages employment by requiringregistration for work or training, whilepermitting recipients who are employedto retain a portion of their earnings.These features, together with the estab-lishment of national eligibility standardsand some measure of Federal adminis-tration, make this legislation more thanchange just for the sake of change.I am particularly pleased that theGovernor of Pennsylvania, the Honor-able Raymond P. Shafer, and the Gov-ernor-elect, Milton Shapp, have giventheir wholehearted endorsement to theFamily Assistafice Act of 1970.While much of the discussion concern-ing this legislation has focused on its Im-pact on families with children, we shouldnot lose sight of title XVI which providesfor grants to States for aid to the aged,the blind, and the disabled. One of itsprovisions calls for cash assistance in anamount which would guarantee an in-come of $110 per month per recipient.In addition, the earnings exemption forthe disabled has been liberalized, makingIt consistent with that already in effectfor the blind.There is only one aspect of this bill Inwhich It is vulnerable\u2014it is not perfect.I submit, however, that if we wait forperfection, we will be discussing thesesame issues next year, and the year afterthat, and the year after that, ad in-finitum, while welfare costs and humanmisery grow apace. And, even then, wewould only be postponing the inevitable.While perfection Is an Ideal towardwhich we must always strive, It is nota realistic goal In terms of any legisla-tion, and certainly not In terms of anundertaking as massive as this.I suggest, therefore, that the questionshould not be:\"Isitperfect?\"but rather: \"What Is the alternative?\"With whatever Imperfections it con-tains, the family assistance plan doesprovide fiscal relief for financially hard-pressed States; It does raise benefit levelsfor recipients in areas where they arethe lowest; it does combine work require-ments with work Incentives; It does re-duce inequities Inherent in our presentwelfare system; and It does establish aCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEnational minimum payment, nationaleligibility standards, and national meth-ods of administration. This is no meanachievement.For the first time, all States will begoverned' by the same set of rules, andeach will have the option of contractingfor Federal administration of both thesupplementary payments and the adultcategory programs. In addition, the Fed-eral Government would reimburse Statesfor any costs resulting from this legisla-tion in excess of 90 percent of theiractual expenditures for calendar year1971, plus a factor for cost-of-living in-creases.What is the alternative? If there is one,why has it not been produced since thePresident introduced FAP in August1969?There is one additional aspect of wel-fare reform that has not been em-phasized sufficiently. Ordinarily, whenwe speak of the failure of the welfaresystem, we buttress our remarks withstatistics which show the astronomicalincrease over the years in caseloads andcost. But there is a conspicuous lack ofstatistics reflecting the failure of welfarein terths of the waste in human re-sources,When the President addressed the Na-tion in August 1969 on the need for wel-fare reform, he noted that \"poverty is notonly a state of income. It is also a stateof mind and a state of health.\" It is thisstate of mind and state of health towhich I want to address myself briefly.Recently we have witnessed a cre-scendo of concern regarding our naturalresources, and certainly no one woulddispute the importance of this preciousheritage. But what more important re-source than its children does any nationpossess? And how would one weigh oureffortsIn preserving this resource interms of Its collective state of mind andstate of health?In a statement last April, the Presidentremarked:We all know how the present welfaresystem breaks up families, demeans humandignity, and condemns poor people to alifetime on the dole.We know that Itis not unusual for suc-ceeding generations of the same family tobecome so enmeshed in the welfare mo-rass that it becomes Increasingly difficultto escape. Is this to be the birthright webequeath to children born Into poverty?As we contemplate the cost of imple-menting this program, may I suggest thatwe also consider the cost of rejecting It.The legislation before us provides boththe obligation and the opportunity formeaningful welfare reform.It has been written that \"the fathershave eaten sour grapes and the children'steeth are set on edge.\" How many chil-dren born into poverty during the past35 years have been reared in an at-mosphere of bitterness and despair? Iventure to say it is more than any one ofus would venture to admit. This is a bur-den that no child should be asked to bear,a legacy no parent should be forced tobestow. It Is our responsibility to providea better heritage for future generations.One year ago, I introduced the FamilyAssistance Act of 1969. In reviewing myS 21225remarks of that time, I am impressed bythe similarity with the situation today.Only one element has changed signifi-cantly in the past 14 months\u2014the ur-gency of the occasion. If we do not actquickly, we will not have the opportunityto act at all in this Congress.We are told that there Is a time tokeep, and a time to cast away\u2014a time tokeep silent, and a time to speak. May Ialso suggest that there is a time to dis-cuss and a time to act.And the time to act is now.Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, there hasbeen some comment about the supportfor the President's initiative in respect tothe family assistance program from theRepublican side. In my judgment, thereare a number of us who are deeply con-vinced that this is a very essential re-form and that it represents a really his-toric first by the President and a break-through equivalent to his espousal ofdealing with hunger in this country, oreven superior to that.We have all been distracted, I by mydeep feelings about the trade bill andothers by other matters. That has notbeen made clear. There is, in my judg-ment, a vast amount of support on theRepublicansideforthePresident's initiative.I hope that that matter will not be loston those who write and on those whospeak, because it Is a fact. The tumultwhich has been created has been such asto make It almost impossible to voicethat In a deliberate way, even by one soconvinced as I am.So, before we lock this up, I think It Isvery important to make that clear.Mr. RIBICOFF. Mr. President, will yield?Mr. JAVITS. I yield.Mr. RIBICOFF. Mr. President, I thinkthe Senator from New York Is wrong. Ithink that the press is exactly right. TheRepublicans have not given the Presidentof the United States support on this pro-gram. Let us not have ourselves misun-derstood. What support the President hashad in the Finance Committee and whatsupport he has had on the floor of theSenate has been on this side of the aisle.I do not want to stand here and say thatI am the only one fighting for the pro-gram. I have been out here naked fight-ing for the program. There has been nohelp or succor from the Republicans orfrom the administration. We now havethis motion to recommit which is alto-gether different from the motion that wethought was going to be made, withoutcasting any reflection on anyone.We now have a motion to recommit. Iam curious how the Senators on the oth-er side will vote on that motion to recom-mit.The President of the United States andthe Vice President went up and down thiscountry asking for men to be elected thatwould support and help him. I would liketo see the Members of the Senate supportand help him.Support for the President's programhas come from this side of the aisle. Thejob that the President has to do is withthe Members on the other side of theaisle, Instead of beating the Members onthis side of the aisle over the head. S 21226 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEDecember 28, 1970Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, will theSenator yield?Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, I hadagreed to yield to the Senator fromColorado first. However, I will yield tothe Senator from New York.Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I do notthink that what the Senator from Con-necticut has said In any way changesthe matter and makes me wrong. Thefact is that I said that in the tumult ofthis debate such support as there Is overhere has not been evidenced. There issupport, In my judgment, for the familyassistance plan. That plan has an excel-lent chance to win a majority of themembership of this side of the aisle.It happens that only the Senator fromUtah (Mr. BENNETT)\u2014OUt of great loyal-ty, fine and noble gentleman that he Is\u2014felt that he could support this plan Inthe committee. However, I do not thinkthat is evidence of the degree of supportover here..Second, I point out to my friend, theSenator from Connecticut, that this mo-tion is amendable. If he does not likewhat is in it and if I do not like what isin it, we can amend it. There is no clo-ture on time. It is completely amendableand debatable.I hope very much that we will jointogether to amend it so as to deal withthe things that we consider to be unfair,so that we will be able to resurrectsomething from this bill other than justthe social security aspects of the matter.Mr. RIBICOFF. Mr. President, I givegreat credit to the President of theUnited States for proposing the program.In all candor. I do not know of anyDemocrat who, if he had been electedPresident, would have proposed it.It took a lot of courage and foresight forPresident Nixon to propose this program.He is subject to a lot of criticism bypeople who will say that these people donot deserve help.The President had the courage andforesight to see that any society thathas a trillion dollar gross national prod-uct has a certain overhead that it paysfor any failures. And when we considerthe 14 million people who would be helpedunder this program, we realize that thePresident was right. There are those whosay that no family of four ought to haveless than $1,600 a year.I wonder if any Senator would standup and say that no family of four isentitled to $1,600 a year.I believe in what the President of theUnited States was trying to do. I do notsupport him because he is a Democrat ora Republican. I happen to believe in thisprogram. I believe that the President wason the right track in proposing this mostImaginative program in which he showedgreat compassion, a program which Islikely to start us on the road towardeliminating poverty. I think it deservesmore help and support from the membersof his own party.What is so ironic to me Is that in theclosing days we want to expedite thebusiness of the Senate and it could beexpedited by saying that what we will doIs to vote on social security, because theleadership In the other body has saidthey will not address Itself to anythingbut social security. What our chairmanhas done by his motion has been to bringthis matter completely back into con-troversy, in which we forget the pro-gressive parts of the President's programand substitute the most reactionary ele-ment in the last 30 years in social serv-ices in this Nation.So now we start all over again in avast debate in which Members on thisside of the aisle have undone what theysupposedly have tried to do to simplifythe work of the Senate so we can gohome.Several Senators addressed the Chair.Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, I yield tothe Senator from Iowa.Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, the REC-ORD should be clear that the Senator fromIowa joined the Senator from Connecti-cut in his motion to get his amendmentattached to the social security bill. I think the Senator from New York shouldunderstand that. There were two of us, atleast, and there might have been a third.So the Republican side has not beenwanting.But the matter is not as simple as theSenator from Connecticut puts it.He Is suggesting, \"Here is an amend-ment. Vote it up or down.\" But it is flUedwith defects. It Is a disservice to the Sen-ate to put it up to the Senate in thatway. We should have a chance to workour will on amendments to the bill.The Senator from Connecticut, by hisparliamentary maneuver, in putting thematter before us In that shape, is not be-ing helpful to the President.Mr. RIBICOFF, Mr. President, may Isay to the distinguished Senator fromIowa, if I may reply, the only reason itis in that shape is that the Senate refusedto accede to the requests of the Senatorfrom Delaware to enable the Ribicoff-Bennett proposal, to be put in the firstdegree. I said I would accede to this ar-rangementafter discussion with the Sen-ator from Delaware: and we mentionedthe reason we wanted it opened up was togive the Senator from Iowa and the Sen-ator from Oklahoma an opportunity tointroduce between them, 10 to 12 amend-ments which they had. When this requestwas refused we had no alternative andthis was the only way to get the familyassistance program before the Senate. Itwas not what we wanted. We had noalternative, after consultation among theminority leader, the Senator from Utah(Mr. BENNETT) and me.Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, had it notbeen for the Senator from Connecticutoffering the amendment in the seconddegree, in the first place, the efforts ofthe Senator from Delaware would nothave been necessary at all. So the foun-dation for our trouble was laid when thisamendment was placed at the desk in thesecond degree, and the Senator fromConnecticut was the one who did that.Mr. RIBICOFF. The foundation forthe trouble was when the trade amend-ment was placed before the family assist-ance amendment, and when It becamesubject to filibuster, and the only way wecould remove the filibuster and get thePresident's family assistance programconsidered, was to use a parliamentaryprocedure.Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, I yield tothe Senator from Colorado.Mr. ALLOTT. Mr. President, I thankthe Senator for yielding. I would like tosay two or three words.First of all, I think this proves conclu-sively not only that coming back hereafter the election was a mistake, but thatcoming back here at this time was a hor-rible mistake. Many of the things thathave been discussed here are really superficial. They do not get down to thebasic things that are wrong here, andwrong in Congress.There is no need and there is no rea-son, save and except the family assist-ance plan that we should have been insession after Labor Day of this year. Ifwe would not sit around blindly and ac-cept the \"stuff\" that is dished out to us,not only by word of mouth, the press,radio, and so forth, that Congress is justgetting so complicated we have to be hereall year, and if we would start using ourheads, we would not accept such a messof potage as that kind of statement.We lost our chance to get out of herein a reasonable time. We would haveperformed one of the greatest services tothis country if we could get our businessdone at an early time in the year and notaccept blindly the statement that we aresupposed to stay here all year, and if wewould reassert what I think is one of thegreatest aspects of this Government, andthat is the right of the people at home tosee their Senators and Congressmen intheir own communities, to get their in-terpretations of what has happened, andto subject them to questions in their owncommunities during the fall. That cannotbe done so long as we operate on theabsurd basis we have.This surpasses rule XXI. I am nevergoing to vote for anything below 60 per-cent, and anyone In a smaller populatedState who does is foolish for the simplereason that anyone who subjects him-self to cloture based on majority rule Ishaving a blind faith in human naturewhich this Senator certainly does notenjoy. So I do not think we should.Now, here we are at this hour. No onecan fault the President's courage in at-tempting to get out the family assistanceplan. While we have been flagellated andsomewhat castigated by the Senatorfrom Connecticut, I think the Senatorfrom Iowa has adequately answered that.By the same token, those Senators onthe committee, whether they were on theDemocratic side or on the Republicanside, would have been fulfilling less thantheir duties of office, and they would havebeen doing less than they swore to dowhen they stood at the desk of the Presi-dent of the Senate if they had not de-voted their best ability to working. out abill which was a workable bill, in fact.We know that there are many badthings in the present welfare system.Glen Billings, a county commissioner inone of our large counties, which adjoinsSenator HANSEN'S wonderful State toldme in my office 1 week before Christ-mas that if the present welfare load In-creased in his county at the rate It in-creased the last 3 years, It would equalthe total county budget. It Is a challenget, all of us. December 28,1970Herewe are 3 days, 4 days, 5 days,perhaps, to adjournment. I know theSenator from Connecticut feels stronglyabout his position. But there are othersof us in the Chamber who have workedfor things for many, many years in theSenate, who are being thwarted thisminute by a filibuster in this Chamber,which I think is to the detriment of thepeopleofthiscountry,whichwill destroyoneentireindustryinthis country,and whichwilldestroya whole area of scientific and technologi-cal advancement. We have feelings, too.We feel as strongly about this as theSenator from Connecticut feels, but wehave to face the facts. We have a troikahere. I would like to see a family assist-ance plan worked out. I am convinced,and I say this frankly, that the bill thathas been reported to us does not con-tain many things,because questionshave been raised here again and againto which there has not been providedfull answers.I would have been happy to have seena pilot plan reported so that we couldtry it out in some section or area andfInd out what it is going to cost andwhether this Government can sustainit, and whether out of this multiplicityof welfare plans and \"do good\" programswhich we have passed, overlapping, over-lapping, and overlapping again in thiscountry, we could bring some sense andorder in one family assistance program.This is what I would dearly hope theSenate could do. But I am a practicalman, too.In these last few 4 or 5 days, I knowwe are not going to resolve the free trademeasure, In which the Senator from NewYork is so interested. I know we are notgoing to resolve the family assistanceplan. I do think we have some commit-ments\u2014at least some of us\u2014with respectto social security which we could fulfill.Therefore, I expect, whether there is arollcall or not, to vote for the motion torecommit, with the assurance and un-derstanding which I understand theSenator from Louisiana has given, or Iswilling to give, that as soon as this mat-ter may properly be brought before hiscommittee, they will attack it again.My personal feeling is that we owe ev-ery member of that Finance Committeea debt of gratitude. I do not care whetherthey supported the plan or whether theywere against certain phases of it, no committee has applied Itself so diligentlyto a given portion of legislation as thatcommittee has In these last 4 months. Imay be off a month, but It does not mat-ter. They have met night and day, theyhave met morning and afternoon, and ifwe do not get the family assistance planthis year, If we do not work It out in aform which is acceptable to the Senateas a whole, we still owe the members ofthat committee a debt of gratitude. Themembers of that committee, with everybit of power they had, and consistentwith the very multitudinous questions,technical questions, and legal questionsinvolved in it, have done a job for all ofus upon which we can build in the com-ing year.I hope we are able to do this. I hopewe are able to resolve It. At least if weCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEtake action which we can take, we canexpect to do it.When we get to rule XXII, we will talkabout that in January.I say again that every one of the mem-bers of the Finance Committee\u2014I do notcare whether they were for it or againstit\u2014whoattendedthemeetings andheard the 350 or 400 witnesses, deservethe thanks of the Senate, whether we areable to resolve it at this moment or not.Mr. President,Itoldthe majorityleader that I thought when we cameback we should have a quorum call sometime during the day, and I would hopeto have an opportunity at a later time tosuggest the absence of a quorum in or-dertofind out whoispresent for business.Mr. SCOT'l'. Mr. President, I yield tothe Senator from Florida.Mr. HOLLAND. I thank the Senator.Mr. President, the Senator from Floridais not in politics. Six days from now heleaves the floor of the Senate. He is notinterested In any political implicationsin connection with any of the several is-sues bound together In this bill.The Senator from Florida cannot becharged with opposing the President, be-cause no less an authority than Congres-sional Quarterly has said that the Sena-tor from Florida has supported the Pres-ident more than any other Senator onthis side of the aisle since the Presidenthas presided as such. The Senator fromFlorida has no apology to make for that.He has voted with the President whenhe has thought he was right.The Senator from Florida has not onlygreat respect, but deep affection, for theSenator from Connecticut, and I thinkthe Senator from Connecticut knowsthat. But after looking at the chartsPresented by my distinguished friend, thesenior Senator from our oldest State,Delaware, the other day\u2014charts pre-pared not by him but by the statisticalstaff of the Health, Education, and Wel-fareDepartment\u2014the Senator from Florida knows perfectly well that thereare provisions in this 139-page amend-ment offered by the Senator from Con-necticut which need to be corrected andwhich cannot be corrected under theparliamentary situation now prevailing.The Senator from Florida has not par-ticipated in either of the filibusters thathave been going on, on either the tradebill, which he supports, or the family as-sistance plan, which he would like tosupport if it were a more perfect meas-ure. But the Senator from Florida, tryingto be realistic and hoping the Senate willdo something in support of its own rep-utation, suggests there is one chance forus to get something done In connectionwith the package and that is to supportthe motion made by his distinguishedfriend from Louisiana, and that is thatthe bill be recommitted with instruc-tions to report it back with only certaintitles remaining, let the Senate pass onthat measure, and send it to conference.What does it mean? It means thatover 26 millIon citizens who are nowexisting, many of them, on pitiful socialsecurity payments, will be recognized bythe Senate as 'having a need to have sym-pathetic care shown for their condition.S 21227If more were possible, if we had time,it would be a different situation, but wedo not have the time. We have 5 daysfor the passage of a bill, for the confer-ence, and then for the passage of thatconference report if one ensues.The Senator rom Florida, being onewho has supported the President in larger measure than any other Demo-crat in the Senate, simply says that hecould not vote for the measure now of-fered by the Senator from Connecticut.much as he Is in support of many of itsprovisions, because of the difficulties soclearly shown by the charts which theSenate saw the other day, which make itso clear that the measure has to bechanged, has to be modified, has to beamended before he expects the rule ofreason to be applicable to the poor peo-ple of our Nation.So, Mr. President, the Senator fromFlorida hopes, speaking as a realist only.without reflection on anyone, that theSenate decides to be realistic, decides tovote to return this measure to committeewith instructions which have been men-tioned, so the Senate may quickly, s Ibelieve it will quickly, work its will forthe modification of the bill.The Senator from Florida praises highly the Senator from Louisiana, be-cause it was not an easy thing for him,with very great interest in some of themeasures in the bill which will have tobe eliminated under this motion, havingreported the billin a much differentcondition, to make this motion. I thinkhe knows what I think every other Sen-ator on the floor who Is a realist knows,and that is that the only way open tous whereby we can get something done isto follow that course.One more word. I was a little amusedto hear some of my friends say we aretrying to put the blame on somebody. Iam not trying to put the blame on any-body. I am just putting it wl'ere it be-longs. If the course offered by the dis-tinguished Senator from Louisiana doesnot prevail and if nothing is done on thebill, it will simply mean that the 26 mil-lion people who are recipients of socialsecurity will know they were unheededand unattended to and will believe thatthe Senate has gone home, at a timewhen we should be saying Happy NewYear, offering them a stone instead ofthe bread they have asked for.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?Mr. HOLLAND. I yield to the Senatorfrom Louisiana.Mr. LONG. It was suggested by theSenator from Massachusetts and also bythe Senator from Connecticut that therewas something antipoor or at least some-thing unworthy in leaving in portions oftitle V. These sections of title 5 which Iseek to save are worth $1 billion to thepoor of this country. That is why I didnot move to strike these sections.As a matter of fact, after the Senatorfrom Delaware (Mr. WILLIAMS) proposedthat we limit this measure to titles I andII, I urged him to join with me in sav-ing certain parts of title V. Those provi-sions include $300 million in higher wel-fare payments for the aged; $500 millionin additional Federal funds for child S 21228 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEDecember 28, 1970care,increased matchingforfamily planning, funds for migratory Workers,and for persons training under the workincentive program; and $200 million toencourage the provision of jobs for wel-fare recipients.Mr. President, here is a provision ofthe bill calling for additional help forpoor people, for children, the disabled,the blind, the aged, and for aiding per-sons who hope tobetter themselvesthrough employment to bring them bet-ter income.But the fact is that in several instancesthe court incorrectly construed the statu-tory language we ourselves wrote, alongwith the Committee on Ways and Means,and we have sought to set straight inprecise terms what Congress meant. Iwould hope that this would not preventthe Senate from voting for the motion,because everything that would remainin the bill would be subject to amend-ment, and If the Senate does not wantany part of it, the Senate Would be atliberty to strike it out.Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, I yield tothe Senator from Oklahoma.Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, I soughtthe floor in my own right.Mr. SCOTT. Very well; I yield to theSenator from Kentucky.Mr. HARRIS. Does the Senator intendto hold the floor for some time?Mr. SCOTT. No; after yielding to thedistinguished Senator from Kentucky, Iwas about to suggest the absence of aquorum. I was trying to get to a vote.Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, I havean amendment.Mr. SCOTT. So, if I may yield firstto the Senator from Kentucky, then Ishall yield the floor.Mr. COOPER. Mr. President, as wasstated a moment ago, we face a condi-tion, not a theory. Does the Senatorfrom Pennsylvania consider that thereIs no possibility of our being able to vote\"yea\" or \"nay\" on the family assistanceplan during this week?Mr. SCOTr. My answer to that Is that,acting for the administration and out ofmy own desire as a Senator as well, Ihave been doing everything in my powerto bring about a vote up or down on thefamily assistance plan. I am for It. I amsure It is Imperfect, as is most of ourmajor legislation, but I would like to seeIt enacted.I think we hare exhausted, in thisChamber, every possible means knownto me. If it were possible to get cloture,I would have done that. I am convincedit is not only impossible to get cloture,but It Isdifficult, at this late date, toget 16 Senators willing to even sign amotion for cloture.I regret very much that, as I see it,we are not going to be able to get avote up or down on this plan. I thinkwe should have it.Mr. COOPER. I think so, too. I mustsay, after sitting here for the last 2weeks, not taking any part in the debateon this particular measure, that it hasbecome apparent to me, as I think toeveryone, that we cannot get cloture onany part of the bill, and we cannot geta vote up or down except on the motionto recommit, and then a vote upon. thesocial security part of the bill if it Isreported.I doubt that a single Senator wouldvote against the social security measure.Certainly I shall vote for social security.But if the question is raised as to whethera vote for recommitment is an indicationof opposition to the family assistanceplan, then I intend to vote against themotion to recommit. Of course, I am forsocial security, like everyone else in theSenate, but I wish to make it clear thatI am also for the family assistance plan.I speak with some feeling about thismatter for it is a subject of long concernto me. I do not intend to bore the Senate,but in 1930, I was elected as county judgeof my rural county in Kentucky, chieflyan administrative position.I was 28years of age and found myself the headof my county in a depression. For 8 yearsI served, and there poured into my officepeople, hungry and sick, as in every otherarea of this country, with no hope, nosource .of help except their government.Whatever has been said about theWPA program of that time, it was a greatprogram. It gave work and sustenanceand hope to people. It did a great dealof constructive work. I have traveledthrough every section of my State sincethat time\u2014once or twice a year\u2014andparticularly in the section which hasbecome familiar to everyone as \"Appa-lachia.\" I have seen, since 1938, programafter program, proposed to lift up thepoor on welfare. They have been goodprograms, as far as food Is'concerned\u2014school lunches, milk, surplus commodi-ties, and finally the food stamp plan.However, with all of these programs,and the costly poverty program, the peo-ple have not broken out of the awfuland ugly cycle of welfare without workor purpose. It involves a deterioration ofthe human spirit and mind. There Isforming in my State, as I am sure is trueIn the great cities of other States a classof our people who are separated and ali-enated from the rest of society.I do not know what is wrong with thefamily assistance plan bill. I am sureIt can be improved. I am sure it oughtto be corrected. But I know when cor-rected, it ought to be passed, to turnaway from the present system of goods,food and clothing, necessary, as theyare, and turn on people in the directionof training, education, work and self -suf-ficiency.I believe it is going to be terribly dif-ficult for them to break out of the cycle.We will find many cannot learn becauseof their long disassociation from educa-tion. Many of them cannot eat properly,because there is no one to tell them howto use nutritious foods. It will be hardfor many to get work, because they arenot trained and educated to perform use-ful work in our technical society. Butthe change from welfare to training, ed-ucation, and work must be made.From the moment I heard PresidentNixon make his speech on television overa year ago, I must say my heart andmy spirits lifted up. I thought I saw atlast something in the making to helpour people in our own country.If we cannot help people in our owncountry, we cannot expect to help oth-ers anywhere in the world. So I hopevery much that this plan will be cor-rected properly and will be enacted. Itwill not be enacted this session, but earlynext year. I hope that the plan or thetest plan of the Senator from Connecti-cut, will be enacted.Mr. President, to indicate that I amfor the family assistance, I shall voteagainst the motion to recommit.Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, the Sena-tor from Kentucky pretty much ex-presses my opinion.Mr. CASE. Mr. President, will the Sen-ator yield?Mr. SCOTT. I yield.Mr. CASE. I commend the Senatorfrom Kentucky, who needs no com-mendation from the Senator from NewJersey or anyone else, but I do. As theSenator from Pennsylvania has saidabout himself, he expresses my views to a\"T,\" and my answer will follow his on thismotion.Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, I am aboutto address a question to the distinguishedmajority leader.I would like to say that had we had anopportunity to vote on this matter up ordown, I am as convinced as I can be,based on the length of my experience inthis body, that a majority of Senators onboth sides would have supported the fam-ily assistance plan.I ask the distinguished majority leader,as I said I would do when he was onhis way to the Chamber, I have ex-pressed the opinion that if this bill doesnot pass in this session, that as soon asIt comes over from the other body nextyear we in this body would seek to referit to the Finance Committee, and thatwe would, following proper and completehearings, do all within our power as thejoint leadership to expedite action bythe Senate on this family assistancemeasure. I would appreciate the corn-ments of the distinguished majority lead-er on this point.Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, Inresponse to the statement just made bythe distinguished minority leader, firstlet me say that it is my intention to voteagainst the motion to recommit. Second,let me say that the President has placedgreat stress on this particular domesticprogram. There is a need for much to bedone. I have some grave questions aboutit in my mind, but I am willing to resolvemy doubts in favor of what the Presidentseems to be so personally and intenselyinterested in achieving.It has been pointed out that the wel-fare rates are skyrocketing, and that thenumber of people on welfare is increas-ing at a tremendous rate.If the motion to recommit carries, Iwish to give the distinguished minorityleader and the Senate my assurance thatI shall do all I can as a Senator to bringthe matter up for debate and considera-tion once it is reported out of the Fi-nance- Committee and placed on the cal-endar. It is my understanding that thedistinguished chairman of that commit-tee has indicated an interest in takingthe matter up if the House acts and afterit has acted. That is within the purviewof the committee. I do not think It Issomething which, if gone into, should be December 28, 1970 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATE S 21229gone into hastily, even though there havebeen extensive hearings this year.So I am assured by what the distin-guished Senator from Louisiana has toldme\u2014I hope I am free to state this\u2014thatafter a bill is reported by the committeeand passed by the House, hearings wouldbe held here as expeditiously as possible.When a bill is reported by the FinanceCommittee, I assure the Senate that Iwill be glad to join with the Senator fromPennsylvania in doing all I can to ex-pedite debate, consideration, and dis-posal.I reiterate that I think the Presidentdeserves this much courtesy and thismuch in the way of consideration.Mr. SCOTT. I thank the distinguishedmajority leader.I yield the floor.Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, a parlia-mentary inquiry.The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. PEAR-SON) .TheSenator will state it.Mr. HARRIS. Is the pending motionsubject to amendment?The PRESIDING OFFICER. The in-structions are subject to amendment.Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, a fur-ther separate parliamentary inquiry.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator will state it.Mr. HARRIS. If the motion of theSenator fromLouisianaisadopted, would the bill thereafter reported to theSenate be subject to amendment by theSenate?The PRESIDING OFFICER. That iscorrect.Mr. HARRIS. Would the bill be sub-ject to an amendment in the form of amodified version of the Ribicoff -Bennettamendment?The PRESIDING OFFICER. That iscorrect.Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, first, letme say that I do not in any case intendto support the motion of the Senatorfrom Louisiana. I believe that the Senateought to act on both social security andwelfare reform. I am hopeful yet that wecan, if this motion is rejected, get a voteon the Ribicoff -Bennett amendment. It isan improved version of an amendmentwhich was rejected in the Senate FinanceCommittee\u2014improved, I think, becauseof determined opposition. It has not beenimproved enough. If it were adopted bythe Senate,it would be my hope toamend it, either through later motionsto strike and insert or by other means,to improve it further still.I think itneeds to be acted upon. The time is athand for real welfare reform. I hope,therefore, that this motion will not beagreed to.The thing that has us in so muchtrouble is the trade section of this bill,which I vigorously oppose. I oppose itboth on the substance of the issues in-volved and on the procedural questioninvolved. This sectionistotally non-germane to the principal issues involvedin this bill\u2014social security and welfare\u2014and I would hope that the Senate wouldat last decide to put aside this nonger-inane section, the trade section. It is much too late in this session, with onlytwo days of hearings in the FinanceCommittee, to try to write this kind ofmajor trade legislation, the most im-portant trade legislation we have seenproposed in this country since 1962.So I would hope that that sectioncould be dropped, and the Senate couldproceed to consider social security bene-fits and 'elfare reform. I twice movedin the committee to strike the trade sec-tion from this bill, and I hope that thatmay yet be done by the Senate; and thenthe Senate, with proper deliberation,with proper hearings, could take up thewhole matter, the very complicated mat-ter, of trade early next year and actupon it.I think that those \\vJo support thegeneral provisions of the trade portionof this bill can be reassured by the state-ment of the distinguished Senator fromNew York\u2014which I would echo\u2014thatthere would not be an attempt to delay,through a filibuster or by extended de-bate, final consideration of some tradebill during the early part of next ses-sion, after the proper consideration hadbeen given in the committee and on thefloor.Furthermore, I think Senators shouldbe aware that, as has just been statedby the Presiding Officer, the adoption ofthe pending motion would be a nullity;because if the motion to recommit .isagreed to by the Senate and the billcomes back here as a social security bill,it is then subject to an amendment which,as a matter of fact, I already have hadprinted, which is an improved version ofthe Ribicoff-Bennett amendment\u2014im-proved by amendments which I feel needto be made to it. So we would be doingnothing at all. It is time for the Senate toget down to business on this issue and tomade its decisions and adopt real welfarereform in this session. I do not believewe will save any time by proceeding withthe motion to recommit with instruc-tions.Furthermore, as has been pointed outby the distinguished Senator from Mas-sachusetts and the distinguished Senatorfrom Connecticut, the motion of the dis-tinguished Senator from Louisiana doesnot just strip this bill down to social se-curity, medicare, and medicaid. The bill,as would be reported back to the Senateif this motion is successful, would stillinclude welfare provisions. But those wel-fai'e provisions would not be the kind ofinnovative welfare reform, the kind ofprogressive welfare changes, that manyof us feel are desperately needed. Instead,they would be the kind of regressive andpunitive welfare amendments which theSenate on occasion in the past has re-jected because they tend to demeanthose who receive welfare, making itmuch more likely that they will continuein the cycle of dependency by makingthem at least second-class citizens andattempting to punish them for their pov-erty, rather than offering the kind ofhelp!ng hand we should offer.So, Mr. President,I now move toamend the motion of the Senator fromLouisiana by adding to the instructions a provision that title V also be stricken,and I should like to be heard on themotion.Mr. LONG. I ask for the yeas and nays,Mr. President.Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, I shouldlike to be heard on my motion.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair inquiresofthe Senator fromLouisiana whether he is asking for theyeas and nays on the amendment.Mr. LONG. I am asking for the yeasand nays on the Senator's amendment tomotion.The yeas and nays were ordered.Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, I send tothe desk the modified version.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerkwill state the modified amendment.The assistant legislative clerk read asfollows:On page 405 strike lines 1 through 25 andstrike all on pages 406 through pages 498and on page 499 strike lines 1 through 17.Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, will theSenator yield?Mr. HARRIS. May I first say what theamendment is, and then I will be pleasedto yield to the distinguished Senator fromNew York.This amendment would add to the in-structions under the Long amendmentthe instruction that the entire title V ofthe reported bill be stricken as well asthe other provisions which he wouldstrike under his proposed instructions.I reiterate that I do not in any caseintend to support the motion to recom-mit, but these are issues we will have toface in the Senate at one time or anotherif the motion to recommit is successful.These issues will have to be faced then;and if the motion to recommit is adopt-ed, I would hope it would be adopted in itsbest form.This amendment would strike the com-mittee provision which would institute atype of 1-year residency requirementin the face of the Supreme Court opinionto the contrary, would strike that pro-vision of the committee bill which wouldresurrect the onerous man-in-the-houserule, would strike from the bill the pro-vision which would require a ret.irn ofthe amount paid to the welfare recipientwho does not prevail in hearings, a pro-vision which would certainly deter chal-lenges of illegal regulations by recipientsand others, would strike the committeeprovision which would overturn anotherFederal case having to do with addingeligibility requirements wholly unrelatedto the needs of poor children, would strikethe committee provision which wouldtend to abrogate the right of privacyguaranteed to citizens under the Consti-tution as it relates to welfare recipients;and would strike the committee provisionwhich would do away with the presentsystem which allowsthedeclarationmethod for determining eligibility, withspot checks.I will go into any of these provisionswhich Senators may want to discuss. Ihad hoped that the distinguished chair-man of the committee would agree tothis amendment. The amendment whichI have offered would do another thing:it would strike from title 5 also the pro-vision which was added in committee onthe motion of the distinguished chair-man, the Senator from Louisiana (Mr.LoNG), setting up a Federal Child CareCorporation. I opposed that proposal incommittee. I do not believe it is a good S 21230 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEDecember 28, 1970proposal from the standpoint of thechildren involved. It would set up a Fed-eral corporation to provide child care orday care for children, including the chil-dren of welfare families. It would leaveout, in my judgment, two basic funda-mental requirements of any proper childcare program; that is, parental involve-ment and community control. The dayhas long since passed when poor peopleor black people or other minorities willbe willing to allow a private businesscorporation made up of outsiders to comeinto the neighborhood and take overchild care or day care for their children.I am desperately afraid that is whatcould happen under a private enterprisefranchise system which is permissibleunder this child care corporation pro-posal.Therefore, I think the thing to do, itthe motion to recommit is adopted, is tostrike all of title V and then take up theissue later on, if the motion to recom-mit is adopted. As I said before, I cer-t,ainly hope it will not be, but if it is, thenI want it to be in its best form.I now yield to the Senator from NewYork (Mr. JAVITS), without losing myright to the floor.Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I wish toexpress my satisfaction at the Senator'samendment. That is what I indicated indebate before to our colleague from Con-necticut, who has taken such a laudableand fine lead in respect of the President'splan for family assistance. I think, if weare not going to be back exactly wherewe started, the confluence of two thingsis necessary; first, another controversialprovision\u2014to wit, title I\u2014should remainin the bill if we are going to try to avoidthe height of controversy; and some ac-commodation satisfactory to the Presi-dent and satisfactory to Senators Risi-COFF and BENNETT and others who arealsointerestedinfamilyassistance.Otherwise, no matter what we do on amotion to recommit, we will be back ex-actly where we started, and we will onlyhave demeaned ourselves by marchingup the hill and marching right downagain.I shall support the Senator's amend-ment.Mr. HARRIS. I thank the Senatorfrom New York foi' his comments.I now yield to the Senator from Con-necticut without losing my right to thefloor.Mr. RIBICOFF. Mi'. President, I wantto commend the Senator from Okla-homa. I shall vote against the Long pro-posal to recommit. I shall definitely votefor the amendment of the Senator fromOklahoma to the motion of the Senatorfrom Louisiana. The Senator from Ok-lahoma is absolutely correct, if we arenot going to vote on the family assistanceand have another look next year at thewelfare reform, what the Senate certain-ly does not want to do is to adopt somewelfare changes which do not go forwardas the President desires, but go backwardagainst the recommendations of everystudent in the field of welfare, and everyformer Secretary of Health, Education,and Welfare, Democratic or Republican,So I hope that this body will vote forthe motion of the Senator from Okla-homa and will vote against the proposalof the Senator from Louisiana.Mr. CURTIS. Mr. President, will theSenator from Oklahoma yield for a ques-tion?Mr. HARRIS. I yield.Mr. CURTIS. Did I correctly under-stand the distinguished Senator fromOklahoma to say that, should the Senateby a majority vote recommit the bill toeliminate family assistance and tradethat, notwithstanding that majority ex-pression on the part of the Senate, hewould instigate another motion and theSenate would be back debating familyassistance?Mr. HARRIS. No, the senator does notunderstand me correctly. What I did wasto inquire of the Chair whether, if theLong motion were to be adopted, a modi-fiedversionoftheBennett-Ribicoffamendment might thereafter be offeredto the newly reported bill, and the answerof the Chair was in the affirmative. So Isaid to the Senate that that is one rea-son why we should get down to businesson the pending bill,rather than gothrough the process of a motion to re-consider, because what willbe done could be, in my opinion, a nullity, basedupon what the Chair has said.Mr. CURTIS. I understood what theChair said was that the Senator wouldhave the right to offer an amendment.There is no question about that, But ifthe Senate, by majority vote, expressesitself in favor of eliminating these con-troversial sections, would the Senatorfrom Oklahoma, in the face of that vote,offer another amendment on family as-sistance should the Long amendmentprevail?Mr. HARRIS. Does the Senator fromNebraska think that a motion to recon-sider which strikes trade and many otherprovisions of the bill and the pendingamendment relating to welfare reform isexactly the same question, yes or no, asvoting on a modified version of the Ribi-coff-Bennett amendment, yes or no? Itwould not be.Mr. CURTIS. It has this difference,that the Senate would, by majority vote,direct a certain course, to wit, that a por-tion of the bill go forward. My questionmerely amounts to this: Would the Sen-ator from Oklahoma feel that he wouldbe bound by a majority vote of the Senateif they so voted?Mr. HARRIS. I would be bound in ev-ery respect by what the Chair holds isbinding as a result of what the Senatehad done. Senators can interpret what-ever the Senate does in the way theywant to interpret it. I may interpret itmy way, but the one interpretation thatreally means anything is what the Chairsays, and he. has just ruled that a modi-fled version o the Ribicoff-Bennett pro-posal would thereafter be in order. AndI say to the Senate, therefore, that thereis no use going through this process, thatwe should get down to business on thepending bill.Mr. CURTIS. I do not think the Chairwould compel the Senator to offer theamendment. My question was, Would theSenator offer it in the face of a majorityvote of the Senate?Mr. RIBICOFF. If he did not, I would.Let me make it perfectly clear that Ihad discussions on this proposal with theSenator from Delaware and I was underthe definite impression, after my discus-sion with iiim, that we were going tostrike out titles III, IV, and V. I wasshocked to learn that that was not thecase, that a portion of title V was re-tained, so that under the circumstancesI do nnt think any such agreement wouldbe binding. If the motion were defeatedby the Senate and another proposal wasadopted, I would feel honor bound, there-fore,to reintroduce this amendment,the family assistance program, the Ribi-coff-Bennett amendment.Mr. CURTIS. That answers my ques-tion.Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, let mewind up briefly. I would be glad to agreeto a time limitation on the considera-tion of my amendment if there is anydesire that that be done. Someone maywant to propose that at some later time.I do not want to hold up the Senate verylong. However. I want to say a word insupport of my amendemnt.The amendment I have offered wouldtake out those provisions which seek togo backward, insofar as the rights of wel-fare recipients are concerned.I want to address myself briefly to theregressive welfare provisions of the com-mittee bill which the motion I have of-fered would strike. I opposed these pro-visions very strongly in the committee,as did other members of the committee.I will only mention two or three ofthem.First of all, there is the provision inthe committee bill which would reverselhe progress recently made concerningthe declaration method of determiningeligibility. Mr. President, when MitchellGinsburg some time ago became head ofthe welfare program in the city of NewYork, he began to acquaint himself withwhat one might call the eccentricitiesof the welfare laws in that city and State,and elsewhere around the country. Hefound, for example, that there was a verydetailed investigation that went on inregard to whether or not a welfare ap-plicant had told the truth as to whetherhe had any insurance with some cashvalue.The city of New York had a very de-tailed and complex system of followingup that declaration that the welfare ap-plicant had made, that he had no insur-ance with a cash value, by a series ofletters and other checks with insurancecompanies around the country,Dr. Ginsburg asked those on the wel-fare staff of the city of New York whatthat elaborate system of checking thedeclaration on the welfare applicationcost.He was told that that system of check-ing and Investigating prior to the timethe welfare applicant was able to receiveassistance, during the past year, hadcost the city of New York some $125,000,as I recall it.He then asked how much money thecity of New York had gained as a resultof the elaborate investigation system.The answer was that the city hadgained $7,500, as I remember it. December 28, 1970Dr. Ginsburg said to cut it out. He said,in effect, \"Let us not continue this in-vestigative cheats?\"Dr. said, continue to spend $125,000 a yearin order to pick up $7,500 of net revenue.\"Mr. President, that kind of case canbe duplicated all around the country.Welfare caseworkers over the years havebecome almost a hated enemy of a lot ofwelfare recipients around the country.It is not right that they should be, butthey have been made investigators andlawenforcementpoliceandalmost everything else. In addition to being so-cial workers and trying to help peopleget a chance to get out of poverty andto get off welfare and to be self-sustain-ing and to get a job, instead of render-ing the kind of social services that caseworkers mostly would like to do and aretrained to do, they have for so manyyears been engaged in trying to enforcethe law against those whom they aresupposed to serve.The declaration method of determin-Ing eligibility was instituted during thepast administration in HEW and hasbeen carried on during this administra-tion. The tests of that system have shownthat only 1.8 percent of such applicantswere found to be ineligible. Maybe thereIs less chiseling and cheating by thosewho apply for welfare than by those ofus who fill out income tax returns. Whywould not the same system of checkingbe done In each case? Why would notthat apply in both cases?I will mention only two other provi-sions that my amendment would strikefrom the committee bill If it were adoptedby the Senate.One is the so-called man-In-the-houserule. The Supreme Court of the UnitedStates In the cases of King againstSmith, Lewis against Martin, and Shapiroagainst Solomon struck down those ruleswhich would base eligibility, not on actualresources available to the children or toa family, but on an imagined Incomefrom people not legally obligated to sup-port the children involved.The clear Import of those ol\u00e7l rules wasthat a welfare recipient was a second-class citizen who did not have the samerights as other citizens.We support a welfare system\u2014andmany of us support a reformed welfaresystem\u2014not only because of the moralityInvolved, because we want to do whatis right insofar as we can toward a lotof people who are less fortunate than our-selves, but also because it Is in our ownself-interest to do so. Mr. President, Ifwe do not help provide a decent standardof health and a decent standard of lifeand enough to eat for the little childrenin this country, for all the little childrenin this country, we pay for it many timesover In increased welfare, in the con-tinuation of the welfare cycle, In reme-dial education and training, in narcoticaddiction, and in prisons.Mr. President, the costs of prisons andor crimes are far more than It wouldcost us to do the right thing In theInitial Instance and provide for a decentstandard of living for every child, whichCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATE S 21231There is a myth that people go from placeto place, across State lines, in order toget into a State with a more generouswelfare system. That is a myth, and thefacts show that it is a myth. People donot move from State to State because ofthe difference in welfare laws or the dif-ference in welfare programs. In NewYork, a check showed that less thrn 3percent of those who applied for welfarehad lived in the State for less than 1 year.People move from one place to anothrhoping for a better job. So often, espe-cially now when fewer jobs are avail-able, with a needlessly slack economy,with job lines needlessly long, they findthat chance is not there for one reasonor another, and many of them apply forwelfare. Only about one-third of thoseeligible for welfare have applied in thepast but many of them are becomingmore pinched as the economy becomestighter and tighter.With a 1-year residency requirementthere was case after case of a youngmother with children in whose home thegas had been turned off, the electricityhad been turned off, the children did nothave shoes or clothing to go to school.They had applied for welfare but weretold that the residency requirement pre-vented them from being eligible, otherforms of relief had run out, and herewere little children who were desperatelyin need but who were not eligible as wel-fare recipients because of the residencylaw.I think, is the right of every child inAmerica. If I am correct in feeling thatIt isin our own self-interest to providefor a decent standard of living for everychild in our country, then we would bedefeating our State purposes, if, by ourrules and our laws, we demean those whoreceive welfare assistance, if we degradethem and hold them up to public shameand ridicule, as was true under some ofthese old rules and laws that the SupremeCourt has now stricken down.We would now go back to those oldrules, those old, degrading, and demean-ing rules which in many instances makesecond-class citizens out of welfare re-cipients, that tend to fake away fromthem rights that other American citizensenjoy. That Is why the amendment Ihave offered to the motion of the Senatorfrom Louisiana would strike out thoseregressive portions of the bill.It would strike out that portion of themeasure which attempts to get aroundthe' opinion of the Supreme Court in thecaseofShapiroagainst Thompson,which knocked down the 1-year resi-dency requirement for people in need ofpublic assistance.America is one country where whethera little child is born in Mississippi, Okla-homa, or New York decides if that littlechild, that American child, is entitledto the same kind of chance for a decentlife and the same chance for decenthealth, and the right against hunger,and the right to live in a decent homeand to go to a decent school, The Supreme Court said that is notMr. President, years ago there were constitutional.

S 21232 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEDecember 28, 1970Mr. LONI Mr. President, every pro-vision the Senator seeks to strike wouldbe subject to amendment If the motionto recommit carries. The Senator is say-ing he is not going to vote for the motionto recommit and he would have no obli-gation to go along with anything the mo-tions suggests or provides, if it carries.He has already said he is going to voteagainst it, even if he gets his way, sowhat is the use of trying to humor theSenator.On the other hand, I believe it wouldbe well to point out with respect to thosewho might be inclined to vote for themotion that the whole purpose of the mo-tion is to dispose of these two issues whichare keeping us from voting on the bill.One is the family assistance plan andthe other is the trade bill.When one votes for the motion thereIs an implied understanding that, havingdone that, if we want to pass the bill wewill proceed to table further versions offamily assistance and the Trade Act, tokeep those off the bill in the event it isso reduced.If the motion were agreed to the Sen-ator could move to strike any part of thatwhich remained in the bill, and thatwould be entirely in order. The motionwould suggest that anyone could amendor strike from the bill something he didnot like.Unfortunately, the Senator will not letus get to that point. Now, he is filibuster-ing the bill.Mr. HARRIS. In what way? I believe Ioffered to have a time limitation on theamendment.Mr. LONG. The Senator keeps talkingabout the matter. The Senator made along speech.Mr. HARRIS. I will ask a questionnow, if the Senator will yield for thatpurpose.Mr. LONG. I yield.Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President,I ask unanimous consent that further debateon the pending amendment to the Longmotion be limited to 30 minutes, equallydivided between the Senator from Louisi-ana and me.Mr. LONG. May I suggest it be 10 min-utes equally divided.Mr. HARRIS. I am pleased to agreeto that.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is thereobjection? The Chair hears no objection,and it Is so ordered.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, let me justmake It clear that the Senator in hismotion\u2014The PRESIDING OFFICER. Whoyields time?Mr. LONG. I yield myself 5 minutes.The Senator in his motion would strikeout every single provision that helps thepeople who need it most. For example, ifhis motion passed, under the provisionfor 10 percent social security increasesand a $100 minimum, States would berequired to consider every item of incomthat would go to a needy person. So whensocial security beneficiaries received a$10 or $20 or $30 increase in their socialsecurity checks, as the case might be, theStates would be required to proceed tocut their welfare checks by the sameamount that the social security checkshad been increased.I am sure the Senator would not likethat to happen, but that is what wouldhappen ifthe Senate agreed tohisamendment.We have provided that there will bea $130 minimum for people who are noteven drawing social security, if they haveno other income. That provision wouldbe stricken out by the Senator's amend-ment.There are other provisions relating tomigrant families with children. I haveseen the Senator vote to help migrantfamilies,buthisamendment wouldstrike the provision wherein the Govern-ment would put up 75 percent of the costof helping migrant families.There is provision for 90 percent ratherthan 80 percent matching funds fortraining people and providing them withwork under the work incentive program.That provision would be striken out.There is a provision for more generousmatching funds for child care. That prd-vision would be stricken out. The match-ing formula for child care would bemoved up from 75 percent to 90 percent.That provision would be stricken.There is provision for tax credit forthose who hire people who are on tilework incentive program, which is de-signed to train people and get them jobs.That provision would be stricken.Altogether, there are benefits amount-ing to $1 billion for people who need itmost.IftheSenator wantstopropose amendments to strike what remains inthe bill point by point, I think we oughtto do that when we get around to votingon recommitting the bill, which he isagainst. If we do 1not do that, it will notbe possible for the Senate to make anykind of decision with regard to tile peoplewho the Senate believes should not bethe rolls and whom the Senate believeswould be benefited by an erroneous courtdecision. That is something which shouldbe decided, but it will not be decided inthe event the amendment carries, becausewe will never get around to voting on it.I reserve the remainder of my time.The PRESIDING OFFtCER. Whoyields time?Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, I yieldmyself 2 minutes.The Senator wants to make things gofaster, and the best way to do that is totake out these provisions which I havelisted. The other questions which areraisedbythedistinguished Senatorfrom Louisiana are irrelevant becauseI have already asked the Chair about it,and the Chair has responded that if theLong motion is agreed to and the bill isreported back to the Senate, it will beamendable. We could then take up in anaffirmative way, as I think we shouid,the items the Senator has set forth.I do not think the committee went asfar as it could with regard to migrantworkers. I think that issue should bebrought up as an affirmative matter.I do not think the committee did theright thing in relation to child care, asI said earlier. I would rather strike thatprovision from the bifl and take it up Inan affirmative way, if the motion Is goingto be agreed to, by later amendment. Theother provisions which have been men-tioned obviously are provisions which canbe offered, if the motion is agreed to, byamendment; and I say now they will be.We ought not, on the one hand, saywe are not going to have any welfare re-form, which is the import of the motionof the Senator from Louisiana, and thenturn back again and say, not only are wenot going to have any welfare reform,but we are going to go backward. My mo-tion would prevent us from doing that.Mr. LONG, Mr. President, I yield I minute to the Senator from Utah (Mr.BENNETT).Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, it seemsto me that if we are ever going to getthis matter handled, it would be betterto clear the decks. I have been opposedto the motion to recommit, but I realizethat, because of the lateness of the hour,because we have to go to conference withthe House on this and on several otherbills, we should not continue this futileexercise.I would have to oppose theamendment of the Senator from Okla-homa, because it just confuses the issue.It divides those who might have sup-ported the action of the Senate FinanceCommittee. It is an overkill because, ob-viously, he is taking out some provisionswhich he would not want to be takenout.Reluctantly, I am going to vote for theproposal of the Senator from Louisiana,even though my name is on the otheramendment, because I realize we havereached the time and place now where, ifwe are going to be able to salvage any-thing, we had better proceed in the wayhe has indicated.I have been assured, as have othermembers of the Senate Finance Com-mittee, that when we meet again in thenew session, if we can quickly get a billover here from the House, we will havea much better opportunity than we havehad in the closing weeks of this sessionto consider the whole problem more care-fully.So I hope the Senate will reject theamendment of the Senator from Okla-homa.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Whoyields time?Mr. LONG. Mr. President, I yield backthe remainder of my time.Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, I yieldback the remainder of my time.The PRESIDING OFFICER. All timehas been yielded back.The question is on agreeing to theamendment of the Senator from Okla-homa to the motion of the Senator fromLouisiana.On this question the yeas and nayshave been ordered, and the clerk will callthe roll.The assistant legislative clerk calledthe roll.Mr. KENNEDY.

Mr. President, I send tothe desk an amendment to the pendingmotion ofthe distinguished Senatorfrom Louisiana and ask that it be statedby the clerk.The PRESIDING OFTICER. The amendment will be stated.The legislative clerk read as follows:On page467strike lInes 7 through 25.On page 488 strike lInes 1 through 25.On page 469 strIke lines I through 25.On page 470 strike lines 1 through 25.On page 471 strike lInes 1 through 25.On page 472 strike lines 1 through 25.On page 473 strIke lines 1 through 25.On page 474 strIke lines 1 through 25.On page 475 strIke lInes 1 through 25.On page 476 strike lines 1 through 25.On page 477 strike lines 1 through 25.On page 478 strike lines 1 through 25.On page 479 strike lines 1 through 25.On page 480 strike lines I through 26.On page 482 strike lines 1 through 11.On page 483 strike lines 17 through 25.On page 484 strike lines 1 through 25.On page 485 strike lines 1 through 40.Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, I wouldhope that the distinguished Senator fromLouisiana could accept this amendmentto his motion. It does not deal with any-thing other than the modifications inthe present law, some of which previ-ously have been acted upon by the Su-preme Court, that the Finance Commit-tee decided to agree to in regard to wel-fare restrictions. This amendment doesnot strike the entire title V as the pre-vious amendment would have done.Therefore, it is not subject to the objec-tions which the distinguished Senatorfrom Louisiana voiced in regard to strik-ing the more wholesome, in my view,provisions of title V. It relates only tothose welfare restrictions.I would just say, in support of theamendment, that if it is the hope of thedistinguished Senator from Louisianathat the adoption of his motion to recom-mit with instructions would shortenthings down and the Senate could decideupon social security, medicare, and med-icaid alone In this session, the Senatorwould be defeating his purpose if, hav-ing foreclosed, as as practical matter, avote on welfare reform, he neverthelessproposes to the Senate very serious, verycomplicated, and highly controversialwelfare restrictions, as his motion, un-amended, would presently do.So I would hope that perhaps the Sen-ator could take this amendment; andthat would have the effect, should theSenator's motion be adopted, of at leastlimiting the debate or tending to limitthe debate to the items the Senator hadin mind.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, will theSenator yield?Mr. HARRIS. I yield.Mr. LONG. If the Senator Would referto page 546, the table of .contents of thebill, would he designate the sections towhich his amendment makes reference?For example, is he referring to section540 or 541?Mr. HARRIS. I could give the Senatora list of these Items, but I do not haveit from the table of contents. I will justhand it to him.May I say, while the Senator is look-ing at it, that the amendment would notrelate to the child care provisions of thebill nor to the other provisions of thebill to which the Senator voiced his ob-jections earlier, concerning the otheramendment. This amendment would re-late only to those restrictions on thepresent welfarelaw,the restrictionswhich the distinguished Senator fromConnecticut and I and very strenuously in committee\u2014to re-fresh the Senator's memory\u2014and theprovisions to which the Senator fromMasachusetts strongly objected on thefloor of the Senate today.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, section 546,to which the Senator made reference, isone that would be deleted by the motionI have at the desk, which Is pending.I wonder whether the Senator reallyfeels, from his point of view, that it Isregressive to have a definition of em-ployment, for example, as exists In sec-tion 551 of this bill, which I understandis one he would strike.Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, there isno use in us playing games of any kind.My Intent is clear. If the Senator agreeswith my Intent, we can rapidly work outthe matter If there is any defect in thisSo SENATEDecember 28, 1970amendment, which was drawn ratherhurriedly.May I say, in my own defense, that Ihad known that the Senator from Loui-siana was going to make a motion to re-commit with instructions, but it had beenmy understanding\u2014and I did not getthat understanding from the Senatorfrom Louisiana, I hasten to say\u2014thathis motion to recommit with instructionsto strike certain portions of this billwould also strike the restrictive welfareprovisions of the bill, to which I stronglyobject, as the Senator knows.Coming to the Senate floor and find-ing that that was not the case, I had todraw an amendment hurriedly. I drewone earlier\u2014because of the problem inquickly trying to write out each pagenumber and section\u2014to strike the en-tire title V. The Senator objected to that.So now I have tried to make the amend-ment !nore seclfic, to strike only .thosewelfare restrictions to which I have re-ferred.If the amcndment is not precise en-ough, that can be worked out quickly, ifthe Senator feels he can agree to it.Mr. LONG. I have felt that the Senatecould vote on these various provisionsthat the Senator finds objectionable. Ithad seemed to me that the way to do itwould be to recommit the bill with in-structions to report back. The Senatorapparently is not willing to let us vote inthat fashion; but It seems to me if itwould be well for the Senate to vote onthese measures. I believe it is possibleto ask for a division, since the Senatewould vote on the individual issues any-way, and that way we could see what thesentiment of the Senate is with regardto the matters that the Senator wouldlike to strike.I would like to ask the present occu-pant of the chair if it is not correct thata Senator may insist on a division, inwhich case we would vote separately oneach proposition that Is offered.The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. SPONG). The Senator is correct in thatthe Senator may demand a division ofan amendment to the extent that theamendment is susceptible to division.Mr. LONG. For example, sections 540through 551, I would take it, would besubject to a division which would permitus to vote on each one of those sectionsin turn.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Wouldthe Senator give the Chair the pagenumbers?Mr. LONG. Each one is a separateamendment. For example, the first one isnumbered amendment 275 and I wouldlike to ask that there be a vote on com-mittee amendment 275 first. I would like to ask, Mr. President, that we voteindividually on section 540 and then onsections 541, 542, 543, 544, 545, 550, and551. These are all separate provisions.Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, will theSenator from Louisiana yield?The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does theSenator from Louisiana yield?Mr. LONG. I will yield, but I wouldlike to have the response of the Chairfirst; then I shall be happy to yield.The PRESIDING OFFICER. TheChair has previously ruled to the Sena-tor that he has a right to ask for a divi-sion in these instances. Now the Chairhas not as yet gone over these to saythat all of them are susceptible to divi-sion, but in the interests of time we aredoing that here and now. The Senatorfrom Oklahoma has asked the Senatorfrom Louisiana to yield and the Chairasks the Senator from Louisiana if hedoes.Mr. LONG. I would like to ask that theSenate proceed to vote on the first amendment, committee amendment No.275, section 540 of the bill.The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. SpoNc). The Chair rules\u2014is that onpage 467?Mr. LONG. On page 467.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair for the moment holds that is Sus-ceptible of division.Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, I take itthat the dirtinguished Senator fromLouisiana made his original motion toreconsider with the Idea that it mightshorten the Senate's consideration ofthese matters. I do not see how that isconsistent with his present request thatwe divide up the amendment which Ihave offered to his motion and vote on itas many separate times as we possiblycan. His own motion to reconsider withinstructionsIs subject to exactly thesame kind of request for a division, Mr.President, and I feel rather strongly thatthe Senator from Louisiana should notdecide what package the Senate will voteupon. He should not be able to put to-gether a package and say, 'Let us vote'yes' or 'no' on his whole package.\"The Senator from Louisiana says hedoes not want the Senate to vote on wel-fare reform because that would take toomuch time, but instead he is going tohold us several votes on welfare restric-tions. I say that will take too much time,Mr. President.I now yield to the distinguished Sena-tor from Connecticut without losing myright to the floor.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, I object.Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, who hasthe floor?The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Louisiana has the floor.Mr. HARRIS. I thought I had the floorin my own right. I did not ask the Sena-tor to yield to me.The PRESIDING OFFICER. TheChair asked whether the Senator fromLouisiana yielded to the Senator fromOklahoma. The Chair asked him that inhis ruling.Mr. HARRIS. I always appreciate theChair's help, but not particularly in thisinstance.[Laughter. IMr. RIBICOFF. Mr. President, will theSenator from Louisiana yield?Mr. LONG. I will, yield to the Senatorin a moment, but it seems to rae that wehave an Important issue here. The Sen-ate should vote on It. It is one thing fora Senator to say that these are restric-tive provisions or backward steps. But itis another thing to start out by puttingpeople on welfare when they do not be-long there, and then, when we find theydo not belong there, we have to put every-one else on welfare to be equitable. If weare considering taking that approach towelfare legislation, that Is not a verylogical situation. Another Senator mightsay that he does not like the 1-year resi-dency requirement, or this and that othercommitteeprovision.The committeeworked many long months on this sub-ject trying to bring to the Senate aresponsible bill.The first amendment I seek to dealwith relates to men who desert theirfamilies. The Secretary of Health, Educa-tion, and Welfare said that this shouldbe a crime and the committee amend-ment says it is a misdemeanor for a manintentionally to cross a State boundaryfor purposes of denying his family sup-port, when desertion occurs, we have totax taxpayers who are working to sup-port their own families so that they willhave to pay not only to support theirown families but also to support throughtaxes the family of the man who deliber-ately and Intentionally crosses the Stateboundary to avoid discharging his obli-gations to his family, I do not think weshould permit a father to avoid his re-sponsibilities with regard to his familyby crossing a State boundary, and thusimpose on the taxpayers the duty of sup-porting his child.The Secretary of Health, Education,and Welfare is not regarded as a flamingconservative. However, with regard tothisissue,his attitude was that weshould do something about fathers whoimpose such heavy burdens on the tax-payers by crossing State boundaries inthe way I have described. Does the Sena-tor not think that this should be a mis-demeanor? Does the Senator not thinkwe should call upon the Federal Gov-ernment to sue the man and collect whatthe Government had to pay becausethe man crossed the State boundary toavoid his obligations to his family\u2014knowingly and with the Intention ofdoing so?It is my understanding that about 16percent of the families receiving welfareare cases where the father deserted thefamily.If the father crosses a State boundaryto get beyond the reach of that State law,why should it not be a misdemeanor?Why should he not be sued for support ofhis family? Why should we not vote onit? Let Senators decide what they wantto do about a father who deliberatelyabandons his children and refuses tosupport them with the result that theFederal Government and the State haveto combine their resources to supportthat family. If Senators think that weshould not do anything about It, let themso vote.Secretary Richardson said he wouldsupport such legislation.He said:We would support legislation which m5deit a Federal crime to cross State lines forthe purpose of evading parental responsibil-ity.The answer Is not to put a Jot morepeople on welfare, but to put somebodyIn jail or at least to try to prosecute himfor deliberately abandoning his family.Why can we not vote on it?Mr. RIBICOFF. Mr. President, howIronic the situation Is to have the chair- December 28, 1970 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATE S 21235man of the committee pleading for a voteon these amendments which have hadlimiteddiscussion and practically no de-bate. I believe that we should vote onpractically every measure before theSenate without a filibuster.The family assistance program is theNo. 1 issue in the President's program.We have been debating it for 1 weekand the opportunity for a vote has beendenied to us.I am for granting a vote on everymeasure of the Senator from Louisianaup or down. But if the Senate is willing tovote on the proposal for welfare restric-tions being suggested by the chairman ofthe committee, I think there is also theobligation to have an opportunity to voteon the family assistance program.I am going to give the Senate that op-portunity, because if the motion to re-commit and report back is adopted, I willthen reintroduce the family assistanceprogram as a substitute for title V. I hopethat those Senators who have been call-ing for a vote on restrictions will then bewilling to have a vote on the family as-sistance program and give the Presidentand the Senate a chance to vote up ordown on the family assistance program.I am all for voting on the amendmentsof the Senator from Louisiana. But Ihope that the Senator will accord theSenate and the President of the UnitedStates the same courtesy and will givethe Senate an opportunity to vote on thefamily assistance prograim shortly.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, I have notmade a speech on either the family as-sistance program or on the trade bill.Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, will theSenator yield?Mr. RIBICOFF. I yield.Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, will theSenator from Connecticut tell us that ifhe does intend to offer his amendmenton the family assistance plan In such away that the Senate can work Its will onmodifications to clean out the deficien-cies that have been pointed out on thefloor of the Senate?Mr. RIBICOFF. Mr. President, I willoffer the family assistance plan that wasoriginally the Ribicoff-Bennett proposal,but will now be the Ribicoff proposal, asa substitute to title V.That will be an amendment In thefirst degree. It will be subject to amend-ment, unless the Parliamentarian rulesotherwise.So, may I say to the Senator that ifa Senator thinks that by adopting a pro-posal of the Senator from Louisiana, heis just going to have a clear-cut vote forSocial security, he could not be morewrong. What the Senator from Louisianadid, Instead of giving us an oportunityto vote on social security\u2014and I waswilling to abide by lt\u2014was to go back totitle V with restrictive amendments.Then, out of a sense of fair play, weshould give the Senate a chance to voteon welfare reform.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, permit meCo explain, with reference to what theSenator has said, that the Senator dis-cussed this matter with another Senatorand not with the Senator from Louisianathe possibility of a motion to recommitand report back. The Senator from Con-necticut was of the Impression that amotion to recommit and report backwould eliminate title V.I had no knowledge of that. I am surethe Senator will affirm the fact that sofar as he knows, I had no knowledge of aplan that a motion to recommit was in-tended to eliminate title V.When I heard the suggested motion,my first thought was, \"Goodness, youwould not want to eliminate title V fromthis bill. You would be striking out $1billion of help for the poorest people inthe country, those who need it the most.\"I would be willing to agree, in thespirit of compromise and wc$uld go alongwith this amendment to strike out allthese sections that the Senator fromOklahoma would like to strike, but onlyif we are not confronted with an effort toadd family assistance and the other pro-grams tothebill.Mr. RIBICOFF. Mr. President, the Sen-ator from Delaware is present. I wantto explain the chronology. The Senatorfrom Delaware has been opposed to fam-Ily assistance, and I have been for it.But we have been living for 8 years Inthat committee In a complete sense ofcomity.I have the highest respect for the Sen-ator from Delaware, and I trust that hehas the same respect for the Senatorfrom Connecticut.During all of these weeks, we havebeen trying to arrive at some way inwhich we could resolve the differencesthat confront the Senate, and especiallywith respect to the family assistance pro-gram.The other day the Senator from Dela-ware told me that he intended to makea motion to recommit\u2014I think that wason Tuesday, or the day before we ad-journed\u2014and report back, striking outtitles In, 1V, and V.In a subsequent conversation with theSenator from Delaware, he said to methat he was under the impression thatthe Senator from Louisiana was goingto join with him on his motion to re-commit. I therefore took it to mean justthat.The chairman of the House Ways andMeans Committee and the ranking minority member have said publicly anumber of times\u2014and it has come backto me from others in authority\u2014thatunder no circumstances would they go toconference on the trade bill, the familyassistance, or catastrophic illness.I do not believe in doing useless things.I recognize that we ought to wind up theSenate's business and we ought to comeback to the family assistance and fam-ily welfare next year, and that In theInterim we should pass the social secu-rity bill and amendments to clarify themedicare and medicaid measures, withwhich the Senator from Delaware and Ihave been laboring for the past 2 years,which are noncontroversial and thechances are that the House would goalong with them in the social securityconference.I was nonplused to find that when themotion to recommit was submitted, wewere again on title 5 and the welfarerestrictions.I am willingto forego voting onamendments and on the family assist-ance program and come back next year.But I cannot see why we are here nowon other welfare restrictions.This is the same matter that the Sen-ate refused us a vote on with respect tothe President's program. If we are onwelfare, then we have no alternative. Ifthe Senator wants to vote item byitem on the welfare restrictions, the Sen-ator should be willing to give us thecourtesy of an opportunity to vote onfamily assistance, because if the Houserefuses to go into conference on welfarereform, the President's program, thesame conferees will refuse to go into con-ference on the welfare restrictions nowadvanced by the Senator from Louisiana.I want to make the situation clear tothe Senate because instead of shorten-ing the session and taking our differencesand cutting the Gordian knot, we areback where we started and nothing hasbeen achieved. I was under the impres-sion, after talking to the Senator fromDelaware, that we were finally workingout of the situation in which we hadbeen.Mr. WiLLIAMS ofDelaware. Mr.President, will the Senator yield?Mr, LONG. I yield.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. TheSenator from Connecticut pointed outlast Tuesday that after proposing a se-ries of unanimous-consent requests whichwere objected to, I stated that I wasready to make a proposal to recommitthe bill and to strike all of sections 3. 4,and 5. SectIon 6 already had been dis-posed of otherwise. That section referredto veterans' benefits. I tried to get avote on that motion last Tuesday. I wasasked not to press the matter to a voteuntil the chairman came, back since dueto weather he could not be here. I be-lieve the Senator from Connecticut askedthat that matter not be voted on at thattime, and I aocodlngly withheld mymotion.Mr. R1BICOFF. The Senator is cor-rect, That was out of courtesy to thechairman who was delayed in New Yorkbecause of a snowstorm.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware, The Sen-ator is correct.Mr. RrBICOFF. I said to the Sen-ator. because he had not been in com-munication with him, that I thought Itwas not proper for the Senate to take upa motion to recommit because of theabsence of the chairman who could notget back to Washington. So I asked thatthe matter be held up. Otherwise I wouldnot have held up a vote on the motionof the Senator from Delaware.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Then thismorning the Senator from Louisiana, ashe had a right to do, presented his mo-tion which would keep part of title V.Section 5 represented committee amend-ments, and I can see his logic there. Theyrepresent major reforms of the existingwelfare program, and I had hoped theycould be retained.I wonder, In the spirit of getting onwith this bill, whether we could not workout some kind of an agreement with theSenator from Loimiana and the Senatorfrom Connecticut-and this is just a sug- S 21236gestion\u2014to strike those three sectionswithoutprejudice,andifSenators wanted votes on those amendments, upor down, we could proceed to their con-sideration. I would like to see this mat-ter closed out and the social security billpassed and sent to conference. It doesnot appear that we shall get legislationhere to Increase social security benefitsunless we take this step.I make that suggestion as one who sup-ported a good many amendments of theSenator from Louisiana and some I votedagainst. I also supported some amend-ments of the Senator from Connecticut,but we are confronted here with a prob-lem of getting a vote. We had one casepointed out where one person would getthree or four different checks from dif-ferent welfare agencies. I suggested asimplified system to guard against thisabuse whereby every welfare recipientwould use his social security number. Inthat way there would be a check againstthese duplications. That is an amend-ment which would be most constructive,and I do not think there would be anycontroversy on its adoption. There couldbe others, but they could not be offered intheir own right and voted on up or down.I would liketo see some agreementworked out which would untangle us fromthis dilemma.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, in view ofthe conversations I have heard fromother Senators in the Chamber, I mod-ify my motion to include the amend-ments of the Senator from Oklahoma.Mr. RIBICOFF. Mr. President, will theSenator yield so that I may suggest theabsence of a quorum.Mr. LONG. I suggest the absence of aquorum.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerkwill call the roll.The legislative clerk proceeded to callthe roll.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, I ask unani-mous consent that the order for thequorum call be rescinded.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Withoutobjection, It Is so ordered.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, as I said be-fore suggesting the absence of a quorum,I modify my amendment to accept theamendment the Senator from Oklahomahas offered.The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. SPONG). If the Senator from Louisianawill suspend for a moment, the (halrfor the record would like to refine it.searlier ruling on the inquiries made bythe Senator from Louisiana. The Chairstated at that time that the amendmentby the Senator from Oklahoma could bedivided to the extent that It was suscep-tible to division. Upon examining theamendment of the Senator from Okla-homa, the Chair has noted that theamendment, rather than written by sec-tion, is written by page; and so, if theSenator from Louisiana were to pursuehis earlier course of action, it would besusceptible to division only In three In-stances.The parliamentary situation, as theChair now understands It,is that theSenator from Louisiana wishes to acceptthe amendment of the Senator from Ok-lahoma. We would say that to accomplishwhat the Senator from Oklahoma in!-.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEtially sought, whether there is to be anydivision or not, it is necessary for him tomodify his amendment as originally sub-mitted to the desk to include all of page481.Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, I do somodify it.The PRESIIDING OFFICER. Theamendment is so modified.The Chair now understands that theSenator from Louisiana now accepts theHai'ris amendment as modified, as amodification of his instructions.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, I would liketo explain that, based upon the colloquywe had on the floor, there was somethingof a gentlemen's understanding betweentwo of my fellow Senators, of which Iwas not aware, involving these particularsections. I discussed the matter with theSenator from Delaware when he men-tioned that he felt the motion should bemade, and that the Senate should agreeto it, including the motion to strike titleV. I pointed out that I believed it wouldbe a very grave mistake. I felt that whileour liberal friends might desire to strikesome part of it, certainly if we were tostrike sections 501 through 530, therewas involved in those provisions assist-ance amounting to almost $1 billion tothe poor who needed it the most and thatthat part should not be stricken. It wasmy feeling that the other sections shouldbe voted on on their merits.I subsequently learned, partly from thecolloquy and partly during the quorumcall we had thereafter, that It was theunderstanding of the Senator from Con-necticut that those sections would notbe in the bill.The Senator from Connecticut, whohas been one of the champions of thepoor and the downtrodden in this coun-try, himself would be the last to strikecertain provisions in the beginning ofthat section which would be highly bene-ficial to the poor.So I belleve in this fashipn we shouldbe able, and I hope we would be able, toagree to the motion to recommit, andthat would still leave to Senators theprivilege of moving to strike or to amendcertain sections, as an amendment to thebill, or to offer something relevant, whichwas not objectionable, or even to offersomething that was not relevant; butit does involve a determination on thepart of the Senate to pass on such of thatas remains.Mr. RrBICOFF. Mr. President, will theSenator yield?Mr. LONG. I yield.Mr. RIBICOFF. Mr. President, I thinkthe statement of the chairman puts anentirely different light on the entireproblem, because he is correct that, sec-tions 501 to 530 are basic Improvements,In which substantial benefits are given tothe aged, the blind, and the disabled, aswell as many people on welfare, Theother sections that were suggested to bestricken by the Senator from Oklahomawere restrictive. That is why I was at aloss to understand why we would notvote on welfare reform but would onwelfare restrictions. There Is a difference,and I am glad the chairman has agreedto accept the modification of the amend-ment of the Senator from Oklahoma.December 28, 1970May I say this in conclusion? As faras I am concerned, I am going to vote\"no\" to the motion of the Senator be-cause I still think that the Senate shouldhave the opportunity to vote on familyassistance. I recognize the realities of thesituation. As long as the restrictions areremoved, If the Senator from Louisianashould prevail, then I would not considerthe family assistance plan at this time,because to do so would amount to goingdown to defeat on the social securitybenefits for 26 million Americans and$1 billion worth of increased welfarepayments to the people who are at thebottom of the economic and social scalein this country. In addition, the result-ing filibuster would render the Senateuseless to perform Its tasks. But againI am encouraged by my conversationswiththe Senator from Louisiana andthe Senator from Utah, who next yearwill be the ranking minority member onthe Finance Committee, that they willdo everything possible to expedite thehearings on the family assistance plan,and I hope on trade as well, because eachis important.I would hope that we on the FinanceCommittee will recognize our obligationand will not tie social security and catas-trophic illness and trade and welfare toone bill.I would hope that we wouldhave the responsibility by leaders in Con-gress to see that there will be full andseparate hearings and markups on eachbill, bring them to the floor, and havethem debated to the fullest extent possi-ble. I will say to each and every Senatorknow that the family assistance plan Iscomplex and complIcated and a realchange in the philosophy of this countryand that It deserves long and carefuldebate. That also goes with-respect totrade.Since I have assurance from the Sen-ator from Montana, the majority leader,the Senator from Pennsylvania, the mi-norityleader,therankingminority member of the Finance Committee, andthe chairman of the committee, I thinkwe can get along with the business of theSenate.Mr. BgNNETT. Mr. President, will theSenator from Louisiana yield so I mayrespond?Mr. LONG. I yield.Mr. BENNErr. Mr. President, to theextent that my efforts will be useful tothe processes, I will do everything I canIn all three of those areas. I am Inter-ested in seeing a correction of our tradesituation. I am very Interested in follow-ing through with the President's pro-posal to improve our welfare program. Iam not sure that this social security billas we pass It will be the final one. Weprobably will have more social securityamendments.What gives me hope is the fact thatnext time we should avoid the time pat-tern that brought us to this impasse. It ismy understanding that we have assur-ances from the chairman and the minor-ity leader of the House Ways and MeansCommittee that they will get the legisla-tion over to us early so that we will notbe caught at the end of the session, andwe should have time In 2 yrs o' thenext Congress to give ample time to allthree of these matters and I hope make December 28, 1970very substantial contributions to theirimprovement.To the extent that I can make anycontribution to that,Ishall be veryhappy to do so.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, I yield tothe Senator from Georgia.Mr. TALMADGE. Mr. President, wehave only 5 days remaining in this ses-sion of Congress before we are requiredto adjourn by the Constitution. It wasobvious some days ago that at the ratewe were moving, we were spinning ourwheels, we were going to wind up gettingnowhere, the 26 million retired Americanson social security would be denied theirraises, and the three million people draw-ing public assistance\u2014the needy blind,the aged, and the totally and permma-nently disabled\u2014would be denied thebenefits which this bill would give them.It seems to me that now the Senateis beginning to make progress. But wecan only make progress if we recognizethe realities of what is possible this latein the legislative session.Each of us is interested in practicallyevery provision of this bill. I have thehonor to represent a State that is heav-ily dependent upon textiles. Some 250,-000 Georgians make their living either inthe garment industry, or in textile mills,or in producing the cotton that s soldto the textile mills. There are 2,400,000Americans similarly situated through-out the country. They are losing theirjobs at the rate of 100,000 a year.The Senate, by overwhelming votes in1948, in 1968, again in 1969, and againin 1970, has attempted to take correc-tive action in that regard. The House ofRepresentatives heretofore has refusedto accept our efforts in conference. Thisyear the other body sent us a bill of itsown. There was substantial oppositionin the Senate to the House-passed bill,but the Senate Finance Committee, onceby a vote of 9 to 3 and again by a voteof 11 to 6, has determined that thesepeople ought to have some relief andsome protection. The Senate, by a voteof 55 to 31 on a motion to lay on thetable, also indicated its desire to takeaffirmative action.Knowing the realities of the situation,I do not think it is possible at this timeto get a trade bill, and for that reason Ishall reluctantly vote for the motion ofmy distinguished chairman, the Senatorfrom Louisiana. I am happy to see thespirit of compromise on the part of thedistinguished Senator from Connecticutand others who recognize that at thislate date in the session, the Senate is notgoing to take action to add another 14million people to the welfare rolls of thiscountry without giving the matter ade-quate and thorough consideration.I think, therefore, Mr. President, thatIn this spirit of compromise, even at thislate date, it will still be possible for theSenate to approve a bill to benefit thosemillions of elderly Americans who are inneed and in dire straits. Some of them gohungry most of the time, because theycannot make ends meet on the mere pit-tance they receive on public assistanceor the small social security benefits thatthey get at the present time.For that reason, and only for that rea-son, I shall support the motion of myCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEdistinguished chairman. I ask him now ifit will be possible for the Senate FinanceCommittee, early in the 92d Congress, totake action on trade legislation in orderthat we can do something to correct ourhemorrhage of dollars and gold, our ui-favorable balance of payments, and theloss of the business that we are exportingto foreigners throughout the world. Itseems to be the policy of many Senatorsto export all of our jobs and put all ourpeople on welfare. But if we are going toexport our jobs, it simply will not bepossible to put our people on welfare, be-cause we will not have the tax resourcesto support the welfare program.Will my chairman hold hearings on itnext year, so we can get early action onthe trade bill?Mr. LONG. Mr. President, I discussedthis matter previously with the Senatorfrom Georgia as well as the Senator fromConnecticut. Both of them have madethe point that we should hold hearingsat the earliest possible date consistentwith our other duties, because of thepressing need to act in this area.I can assure the Senator that we willhold hearings at the earliest practicabletime, to begin to develop answers to thisvexing problem.Mr. BYRD of Virginia. Mr. President,will the Senator yield?Mr. LONG. I yield to the Senator fromVirginia.Mr. BYRD of Virginia. Mr. President,I support the position taken by thechairman of the Finance Committee.What the distinguished Senator fromLouisiana is attempting to do is to bringsome order out of chaos. He is attemptingto strip from the social security bill allof the nongerma\u00f1e amendments.If we ai'e going to have a social securitybill, we can only have that bill, as Isee it, at this late stage in the session, ifwe take off all of these other amend-ments and strip It down to the socialsecurity bill, in order to give the socialsecurity recipients an increase in theirbenefits.Many of the amendments that will bestricken off of the bill if this recommitalmotion is carried will be amendmentswhich I have supported. Others will beamendments which I have opposed. Butbe that as it may, if we are going to bringa social security bill out of this Congress,if the Senate is to have an opportunityto pass a social security benefit bill, thenit seems to me to be necessary to followthe recommendation of the chairman ofthe Committee on Finance to recommitthisbill,stripitofits nongermaneamendments, and bring back a social se-curity bill, which up to this point hasbeen held hostage by other amendments,and then give the Senate an opportunityto vote for an increase in social securitybenefits, which benefits, It seems to me,the people so badly need in this time ofinflation\u2014and contrary to what manysay, I do not think inflation is gettingbetter; indeed, it may be getting worse.I think the social security recipientsare entitled to this Increase in their bene-fits, and I think the Senator from Lou-isiana has indicated a way by which theSenate can pass this social security billS 21237at this session and provide those bene-fits.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, I ask for theyeas and nays on my motion.The yeas and nays were ordered.Mr. LONG. I yield to the distinguishedSenator from Wyoming.Mr. HANSEN. Mr. President, I asso-ciate myself with the remarks made bythe Senator from Georgia. I, too, shallsupport the chairman of our Committeeon Finance. I think the reasons for mydecision have been adequately set forthby the remarks made by the distinguishedSenator from Georgia.I think there is great need to enactsome legislation which will protect thiscountry against the loss of dollars, theloss of jobs, and the outflow of indus-tries that we have been experiencing. Butfor the time being, I think the actions ofthe chairman have been courageous,honest, and forthright, and I shall givehim my support.Mr. LONG. I thank the Senator. I yieldto the Senator from New York.Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I wish tojoin my colleagues, first, In praising thestatesmanship exhibited by the Senatorfrom Louisiana (Mr. LONG), the Senatorfrom Oklahoma (Mr. HARRIS), the Sen-ator from Connecticut (Mr. RIBrcoF'r),and the leadership of the Senate Inbringing this matter to some kind offinality. I think whatever we do now isbound to bring honor to the Senate, andI shall loyally cooperate.I appreciate very much the statesman-like attitude of the Senator from Georgia(Mr. TALMADGE) ,withwhom I thoroughlydisagree on his statements as to the mer-its of trade quotas, but I certainly laudhis desire to get something done on whatwe can get done; and I certainly join onthat wholeheartedly.I rise only to make this point: I real-ize that everything must be the result ofaccommodation between men. It is a factthat the Senator from Oklahoma (Mr.HARRIs) and the chairman have con-certed in eliminating many, if not most,of the objectionable major changes insocial philosophy in the welfare plan, byeliminating sections 540 through 551, in-clusive, from the bill. There still remainsthe whole question of Federal child care,and a number of bills have been intro-duced on that issue, representing anenormous amount of creative thinking.The Senator from Oklahoma has intro-duced one, the Senator from Indiana(Mr. BAYH) has introduced one, I haveintroduced one, and there has been aWhite House conference on the subject.I really think, with all respect\u2014andthat is my reason, of course, for rising\u2014that, if that, too, could be taken out ofthis consideration, it would be most help-ful,I only appeal to the chairman. I real-ize that many things have to be put to-gether which lean on each other, and ifthe chairman of the Finance Committeefeels insistent on it, I certainly wouldnot wish to cross him at this late date byoffering another amendment. But I dosubmit to him, with all respect, that thedeliberation in which he is now join-ing\u2014for trade, for the family assistanceplan, and for catastrophic health Insur- S 21238ance\u2014is equally deserved by the childcare provisions ofthisbill.His own stature and importance in respect of thecommittee which he heads is so greatthat I submit to him, as a matter ofstatesmanship and policy, whether allof us might not be better served if that,too, should be the subject of really pro-found deliberation and creative enter-prise by him and the others.Mr. LONG. Mr. President,I would hope the Senator would reserve that is-sue and let the Senate decide it after wehave concluded this phase, because someof the most concerned people in thecountry in this area believe that whatwe have done with regard to child careis one of the best things that could bedone. The AFL-CIO thinks so, and manyof the child care experts think so. Somevery fine people do not agree and takethe view that the Senator from NewYork takes.I would urge the Senator to let thatbe in the same category as an amend-ment that has to do with peer reviewunder medicare where the majority onthe committee agreed with the distin-guished Senator from Utah, but the dis-tinguished Senator from Nebraska doesnot. He is going to submit that issue tothe Senate. I wish the Senator from NewYork would raise the child care questionafter our motion is agreed to, because itis one about which the best intentionedpeople differ.I would hope that the Senator wouldlet us agree to this motion and thenraise the child care question and lay outboth sides of the argument and let theSenate decide it.Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I am go-ing to comply with what the Senatorfrom Louisiana asks me to do. I think itis in the highest interest of the Senate'saction. I did not wish, by remaining si-lent, to fail to point out the seriousness ofthis issue, that many of us consider itto be equal in weight with what is goingout of the bill right now under this mo-tion and gentlemen's agreement. I didwish to have the Senator informed thatthis would not be a filibuster or extendeddebate but a determined fight, becauseit deserves it.Mr. McINTYRE. Mr. President, theproposed action by the Senator fromLouisiana (Mr. Lowo) and the Senatorfrom Delaware (Mr. WILLIAMs) wouldhave the effect of killing the possibilitiesof providing protection for Americanshoe and textile workers during this Con-gress.There was an attempt to drop protec-tion of the shoe workers in the FinanceCommittee. That failed.There was a further attempt to, in ef-fect, kill shoe and textile quotas on De-cember 18. This was defeated by a voteof 31 to 58.These two recent actions convince methat the sense of the Senate supports thecontention that our shoe and textile in-dustries need some form of qualified pro-tection if they are to survive and main-tain sorely need payrolls.These actions confirm my belief thatthis body is acutely aware of the plightof the shoe and textile industries and isreluctant to turn its' back on them.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEI am certain that many Members feelprecisely as I do about this issue, We be-lieve in free competition. We are not pro-tectionists as such. But we refuse to standidly by when unfair overseas competi-tion results in the shutting down of ourfactories and the unemployment of ourworkers.This is painfully true in the case of theshoe industry in my State of New Hamp-shire and the rest of the Nation, just asit is true in the case of the textile indus-try throughout the country.Two years ago the shoe and leatherindustry was the single largest manu-facturing employer in New Hampshire,having a total work force of 20,536 peo-ple. By 1969, employment had droppedto 18,466 and the industry had lost itsleading role.In the past 2 years, almost 10 percentof the shoe factories in New Hampshireclose down, severely affecting the econ-omy of the communities in which theywere located, and by July of 1970, Mr.President, the shoe and leather workforce had shrunk to only 16,400.Now there are those, including thepresent administration, who apparentlyview the demise of the domestic shoe in-dustry as unavoidable, inevitable, and,indeed, necessary to preserve our presentforeign trade policy.I strongly disagree with that thesis,and I deeply resent having the economicbackbone of my Stateand this industrysevered on the sacrificial block of to-tally unrestricted free trade.For the crucial fact remains, Mr.President, that in almost every singlecase in New Hampshire, the major rea-son for the shutting down of shoe plantsand the resulting loss of jobs can be di-rectly attributed to competition fromcheaply made foreign shoes.Let me repeat once again. I believe infree competition when that competitionis fair competition. Our shoe and textileindustries are the victims of unfair com-petition and this is why I continue tourge the enactment of quotas which willrestore fairness and, in the long run,strengthen free competition.Mr. President, I want to join the Sen-ator from Georgia in expressing the hardfacts of the situation before us. Withinthe time constraints facing us at this latehour of the 91st Congress a trade bill isan impossibility. It is also certain that asocial security bill is sital to the needs ofmillions of our elderly citizens. There issolid agreement that social security andmedicare amendments can pass. Withthe promise for early trade legislationconsideration in1971Iwillvote to recommit.ThePRESrDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on previ-ous occasions I have objected to this be-cause of the inclusion in the bill of thematerial which, in my judgment, and thejudgment of many others here, hasweighted down and presented an invita-tion to disaster for our country. But, Mr.President, it is still possible for any Sen-ator to add on any of these amendments.I join with all my colleagues in the hopethat this will not be done. In order toshow good faith and to honor theefforts of the Senate to disentangle it-self, I shall not object.The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I hope thatthe Senators present will follow It.The amendment would strike from thebill that section which has been called\"peer review.\" The problem is how wedefine peer review.Inadministeringmedicarecertain abuses have sprung up. Our staff hasdone some fine work on this matter. Intheir report they concluded with therecommendation that the medical pro-fession ought to police the medical pro-fession. With that statement I concur.The committee had before it manyproblems, as the debate over the last2 weeks has shown. There was testimonytaken on this matter. However, the test!-mony is far conclusive as to a propermethod of peer review.Mr. President, we ended up with 39pages or thereabouts on peer reviewwhich really has not had the attentionthat it ought to have. I am not opposingpeer review as such. I oppose the lan-guage used. And I suggest that in theclosing days of Congress, it ought to goout and we should have another look atit next year.If we wish to examine some of thelanguage, if we turn to page 234 in thebill, it will be seen that this peer revieworganization will have a lot of authorityto police the practice of medicine inso-far as these Government programs areconcerned.On page 234, lines 10 through 11 areIn line with the Idea that the medicalprofession should police the medical pro-S 21239fession. But if we look at lines 20 through24, we see who else would police themedical profession.I read what it says:Such other public, nonprofit private, orother agency or organization, which the Sec-retary determines, In accordance with cri-teria prescribed by him in regulations, to beof professional competence and otherwisesuitable;It gives to the Secretary the power toselect any organization he wants to tellthe doctors how to practice, when a per-son should go to the hospital, when thefacilities are adequate and many otherfar-reaching questions.I contend that would enable the Sec-retary to turn to an organization of somecrusader, such as Ralph Nader, or any-one else, to police the medical profession.I caB attention to some other languageon pages 237 and 238. There is some verydeceptive language there. It reads:No Professional Standards Review organi-zation shall utilize the services of any in-dividual who is not a physician to make finaldeterminations with respect to the profes-sional conduct of any physician, or any actperformed by any physician In the exerciseof his profession.The catchword there is \"final.\" Wecould have an organization with thou-sands of clerks who could take a bluepencil and direct the practice of medi-cine, if we had one doctor at the top.That doctor would not have to be a prac-ticing physician if he has been to medicalschool and has a license. He puts hisinitials on the final paper and that willdetermine how the medical professionshall treat the patients.Such language should not be agreed toin the closing days of this Congress.Surely, we should have peer review, butnot that l\u00e7ind.Mr. STENNIS. Mr. President, will theChair maintain order?The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair admonishes the Senate to be inorder. The Senator from Nebraska maycontinue.Mr CURTIS. Mr. President, amongother things, a peer review organizationwill have authority to require a doctortreating patients to get permission be-fore what they have what is called elec-tive surgery. Who would be the membersoftherevieworganization? Nobodyknows because there is a blank check ofauthority to select any group which theSecretary chooses.This has the real possibility that thebureaus can police the medical profes-sion. I am not here pleading a case forthe doctors. By and large they are welleducated people who take care of them-selves.Iam concernedaboutthe patients.When medicare was adopted, the peo-ple were promised over and over againthere would be no interference with thedoctor-patient relationship;that theywould not be treated in groups but thatevery individual would have free accessto his doctor, unhampered by rules andregulations that told the doctor whatdecisions to make, when to operate, whatmedicines to prescribe, and so forth.I believe this language Is too broad.I believe we should have something like S 21240 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEDecember 28, 1970this, but certainly not the language thatis in the bill. Through the fault of no one,this provision did not get the attentionit should have.My plea is that the matter not be in-cluded in this bill and that it be consid-ered in the subsequent bill.Mr. ALLOT1'. Mr. President, will theSenator yield?Mr. CURTIS. I yield.Mr. ALLOTT. Mr. President, will theSenator state again what his amend-ment would do?Mr. CURTIS. The amendment wouldstrike out the language on page 232 be-ginning at line 11 through line 15 onpage 269.Mr. ALLOTI'. The Senator would strikeout all of the language dealing with pro-fessional review?Mr. CURTIS. The Senator Is correct.Mr. ALLOTI'. There have been manyof these situations which have gottenmuch public attention. It seems to mewe are taking an erroneous step by in-cluding the language on page 234 in para-graph (b) and also including subpara-graph (C), page 237, which, as the Sena-tor has mentioned, contains the word\"final.\"The effect is that there could be anunqualified group doing this sort of workand a doctor or a group of doctors couldbe totally tarred with a brush and afterthey had had their reputations and per-haps their livelihoods imperiled, the onlything they would have would be on finalreview they would have a group of doc-tors to say whether they did or not.Mr. CURTIS. I thank the Senator. Iam on limited time. I do agree with theSenator.Mr. ALLOTI'. I did not realize theSenator was on limited time.Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, will theSenator yield to me for 2 mInutes?Mr. CURTIS. Mr. President, may I in-quire how much time I have remaining?The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator has 3 mInutes remaining.Mr. CURTIS. I yield 1 minute to theSenator from Oklahoma.Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, I supportthe amendment of the distinguished Sen-ator from Nebraska, as I did In com-mittee.Iask unanimous consent to haveprinted in the RECORD a portion of theseparate views I have filed to the reportof the committee concerning this matter.There being no objection, the excerptwas ordered to be printed In the REC-ORD, as follows:The committee adopted a proposal to estab-lish professional standards review organiza-tions at local and State levels throughoutthe country to review such functions as ex-amination of patient and practitioner pro-files;independent medical audits; on-site audits; and the development and applica-tion of norms of care and treatment.The Secretary of Health, Education, andWelfare would be required to enter intoagreements with qualified professional stand-ards review organizations, principally localmedical societies, to review the totaiity ofcare rendered or ordered by physicians formedicare and medicaid patients. Where medi-cal societies are unable or unwilling to un-dertake the -responsibility,theSecretary could contract with States or local healthdepartments or other suitable organizations.This provision has a laudable purpose: toInsure quality care and to hold down un-necessary costs.However, the proposal contains many un-known and unpredictable factors. Further,there are serious objections that it grantsorganized medicine too much control overutilizationoffacilities and payments ofclaims.The proposal should be tested before Con-gress puts it into effect on a total basis asthe committee bill would do.I am not satisfied that this proposal will result inthe savings which have been claimed byits proponents, nor am I satisfied that thereview procedure Is the best and most work-able which can be devised,The House provisions on peer review shouldbe strengthened, and the Senate commItteeprovisions should be stricken.Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, I partic-ularly point out, as I said in those sepa-rate views that\u2014The proposal contains many unknown andunpredictable factors.Further,thereare serious objections that it grants organizedmedicine too much control over utilizationof facilities and payments of claims.Mr. President, I support the amend-ment of the Senator from Nebraska.Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I yieldmyself such time as I may require.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Utah is recognized.Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, medi-care's hospital Insurance plan has a def-icit over 1967 projections officially esti-mated at $216 billion over the next 25years, if we go on as we are going. Onthe other hand, applying cost projectionsof the American Hospital Association,that deficit is estimated at $370 billion.Any figure, or any figure between thosefigures is intolerable.The committee overwhelmingly votedapproval of the professional standardsreview amendment as the basic approachto bringing about effective medical\u2014andnot governmental control of medicareand medicaid. Our present medicare andmedicaidutilizationreviewisfrag- mented, piecemeal, and ineffective. Thebasic approach developed and sponsoredby Senator BENNETT was modified by thecommittee in response to the construc-tive comments of organized medicine .andhospitals.The amendment is designed to assurecomprehensive and ongoing review ofcare provided under medicaid and medi-care by physicians at local levels\u2014usu-ally in minimum groupings of 300 praC-ticing doctors. The amendment Includesevery conceivable safeguard against proforma or token assumption of responsi-bilities by doctors. It includes every con-ceivable safeguard to protect the publicinterest.The Professional Standards ReviewOrganization amendment is a responsibleanswer developed after long and hardwork, to bringing medicare and medicaidunder effective and professional control.We just cannot permit medicare andmedicaid to continue as they have. Con-gress has a responsibility to act.The alternative to use of professionalstandards review organizations is beefed-up review by governmental employeesand insurance company personnel. ThatIs an alternative which holds little ap-peal to us or the doctors.The plan, which has been entitledPSRO\u2014the Professional Standards Re-view Organization\u2014has been worked onfor months by the staff of the commit-tee, by the staff of HEW, and throughconsultation with many scores of doc-tors and professional organizations.I would say that so far as most medi-cal organizations are concerned, the lastremaining disagreement is over how thisorganization shall be constituted. Forobvious reasons there are many peoplein the American Medical Associationwho feel that t.he power should be lodgedwith the State medical society. I haveopposed that because I do not believeit proper for any private organizationsupported by private funds, open to mem-bership, whose membership would becontrolled by private rules, to adminis-ter such a law. Therefore, a program wasestablished under which groups of localphysicians in an area supporting 300 ormore physicians would be invited to offertheir services to the Secretary to carryout this review process.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, will theSenator yield?Mr. BENNETT. I am happy to yield.Mr. LONG. Is it not true that in theyears we spent studying these matterswe found situations such as that in aparticular area where there would be onedoctor performing five times as manytonsillectomies as the average doctorwould be performing? When we lookedinto it, we found that he should not havebeen performing five times as many pro-cedures. He should have been performingthe same number as the others. Thenwe would find a doctor giving five timesas many injections as other doctors andbringing patients infor unnecessarynumbers of office calls, when it would becheaper to give them packages of pills totake.Is it not true that we found a multi-tude of ways in which doctors, hospitals,and nursing homes, particularly thosewho might not hgve as many patients asothers,performed many unnecessaryservices thereby running up the costs ofthe program in ways that everybodyagreed should not have happened?If we do not have the Senator's amend-ment\u2014and as one on the committee Ithink he modified it to meet every reasonable objection of medical associa-tions\u2014then we would not have anymechanism to do anything about theabuses by doctors and other providersof care other than the inadequate mecha-nism we already have.Mr. BENNETT. I am grateful for theSenator's contribution. Some languagewas read as to what power goes to theSecretary. It should be pointed out thatthat is a residual power. He should usefirst the peer group system of review,and, ifit is not available, in the endthere should be some type of review bythe Federal Government. The prioritygoes to local peer review groups, and theSecretary cannot act until he has to act.The point was made that under thelanguage of the bill doctors would haveto give permission to take patients intothe hospital for elective surgery or elec-tive treatment. Actually, we are con-cerned with problems that exist under ourpresent system, in which the doctor can December 28, 1970take the patient Into the hospital andthen, after the patient has been therefor a long time, the service decides itwas improper and refuses to pay for it.Our problem here is to set up a systemby which we can make reasonably surethat the surgery or the other treatmentwill fall within the medicare rules andbe paid for.The amendment has been drawn sothat the peer review organizations willsee to it that a man whose patients areproperly handled can be given blanketpermission to take his patients in fortreatment, and they will concern them-selves only with the problems.Mr. TALMADGE. Mr. President, willthe Senator yield?Mr. BENNETT. I yield.Mr. TALMADGE. Can we not say thatthe position of the Senate Finance Com-mittee on this amendment Is that wewant to return the ball game to theplayers?Mr. BENNETT. That Is right. ThatIs exactly right, but we have to have anumpire In the ultimate sense.Mr. TALMADGE. Either the doctorspolice their own profession or It will bepoliced in Washington by HEW?Mr. BENNETT. That Is right. We wantto offer the doctors the first opportunity.We want to give the local doctors, whoare aware of the limitations and prob-lems of their colleagues, a chance to passon that.The point was made here that allkinds of decisions can be made along theroad and that the doctor only will makethe final decision. That was put in thereto make It possible for the doctor to useregistered nurses or use paramedicalpeople to handle the minutia that gointo loading a doctor down with all thepaper work and with all the compara-tivelyunimportantdecisions.These people would be employees selected bythe doctors to represent them.If this provision is 1-nocked out of thebill, we are left with the House lan-guage, and the House language gives theSecretary full power to do anything hepleases. The doctors will have no op-portunity to review their own profes-sional activity. The purpose of peer re-view Is not to review the claims situation;it is concerned only with medical neces-sity, with professional standards, andwith the possibility of finding less costlyways of treating patients.If ever a proposal has been wortedover and carefully adjusted to everypractical suggestion that has been madeby the members of the medical profes-sion, this proposal has been so treated,and I think It would be tragic if weknocked this provision out of the Senatebill and, therefore, had no chance inconference to do anything except takethe House language and thus mandatedthe Secretary of Health, Education, andWelfare to set up a process by which hewould review and enforce conditions ofmedicare.There must be review. The situations,the difficulties that have been developed,demonstrate that. The doctors want achance to review themselves. I think thisprovision gives them that chance withoutCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEpassingit automatically to a privategroup such as a State medical society.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, will theSenator yield?Mr. BENNETT. I yield.Mr. LONG. Is the language not directedto abuses such as are shown on page 664of the hearings? Here were two doctorspracticing in a ghetto area of a largercity and they were performing, eventhough they were general practitioners,more tonsillectomies than all of the ear,nose, and throat specialists put together.A man might come into the doctor's officewith a headache. The doctor would say,\"It looks like you have a headache. Hereis an aspirin. Meanwhile, you also oughtto have your tonsils taken out.\" So outwould come the tonsils.Such practices contribute directly tothe provision of unnecessary medicalservices and that Is one of the reasonswhy medicare has cost twice as much asit should and why we have found somedoctors making fantastic amounts ofmoney under medicare.This provision would simply enable thedoctors to establish a review organizationand continually review the medical carein their community or area. It is onlyIn the event that the doctors declined todo the job right that the Department ofHealth, Education, and Welfare wouldget into the picture.Mr. CURTIS. Does the Senator pointout that out in the\u2014Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I havethe floor. This Is on my time.Mr. CURTIS. Will the Senator yield?Mr. BENNETII'. Mr. President, howmuch time do I have left?The PRESIDING OCER. About2'/2 to 3 minutes.Mr. BENNETT. I shall be happy toreserve the remainder of my time sothe Senator from Nebraska can askquestions.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator. from Nebraska.Mr. CURTIS. Mr. President, there Isno effort on the part of the Senator fromNebraska to defend abuses. They shouldbe stopped, and they are being stopl,ed.The Senator from Georgia said this wasan amendment to turn the ball gameback to the players.No one can read lines 20 through 24on page 234 and say that is to turn itover to the players. It turns the reviewpowers over to any organization whichthe Secretary determines.What do they have power to do? HereIs what they have power to do: They areto ascertain whether or not such serv-ices were medioally necessary, and toascertain concerning the cost of suchservices, as to whether they meet cer-tain professional standards; they haveauthority to determine in advance anyelective admission to the hospital or tothe care facility, or any other care serv-ice which consists of an extended orcostly course of treatment.Mr. President, I point the finger atno one, and make no criticism of ourcommittee. We had too much work todo at one time. But I submit that thisamendment, consisting of 39 pages, wasnever read in the committee, it wasS 21241never read by a staff member to thecommittee, there was no time after Itwas printed that a staff member wasturned to and asked to go over It sec-tion by section. It has language in it thatwill do things other than that which theproponents would like to have done.Many of these abuses that are men-tioned will be taken care of by Govern-ment audit. Many of them will be takencare of by the voluntary committees inthe medical association, and, given a lit-tle more time, we can write a better peerreview.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator's time has expired.The Senator from Utah has 2 minutesremaining.Mr. BENNE'rr. Mr. President, I shouldlike to read briefly from page 155 of thecommittee report:Priority in designation as a PSRO would begiven to organizations established at locallevels representing substantial numbers ofpracticing physicians who are willing andbelieved capable of progressively assumingresponsibility for overall continuing reviewof institutional and outpatient care andservices. Local sponsorship and operationshould help engender onfidence in the fai- Iliarity of the review group with norms ofmedical practice in the area as well as intheir knowledge of available health care re-sources and facilities. Furthermore, to theextent that review is employed today, it isusually at the local level. To be approved, aPSRO applicant must provide for the broad-est possible involvement, as reviewers on arotating basis, of physicians engaged in alltypes of practice in an area such as solo,group,hospital,medicalschool, and soforth.Going back to the charge that Itwould prevent or interfere with electiveadmissions to hospitals, let me say againthat the doctor has all the power In theworld to take his patient to the hospital.The thing that must be reviewed iswhether that patient Is properly coveredby medicare, and whether medicare willpay for the services. That Is the name ofthe game. That is the problem that weface.Mr. President, the following Statemedical societies have supported thecommittee's program: Georgia, Missis-sippi, Pennsylvania, Hawaii, and NewMexico. Many county societies also sup-port it.I think that the medical profession wasdisappointed that they did not get theright to conduct these reviews throughtheir private State societies. They wantthe system. I hope the Senate will sup-port It and give it to them.The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Moss). All time having expired, the ques-tion is on agreeing to the amendment ofthe Senator from Nebraska (Mr. CURTIS).On this question, the yeas and nays havebeen ordered, and the clerk will call theroll.The assistant legislative clerk calledthe roll.Mr. KENNEDY.

Mr. President, I askunanimous consent that further readingof the amendment be dispensed with.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Withoutobjection, it is so ordered; and, withoutobjection, the amendment will be printedin the RECORD.The amendment is as follows:On page 145, between lines 14 and 15, in-sert the following:(d) In the case of a health care facilityproviding health care services as of Decem-ber 18,1970, which on such date is com-mitted to a formal plan of expansion or re-placement, the amendments made by thepreceding provisions of this section shall notapply with respect to such expenditures asmay be made or obligations incurred for cap-ital items included in such plan where pre-liminary expenditures toward the plan ofexpansion or replacement (Including pay-ments for studies, surveys, designs, plans.working drawings, specifications, and siteacquisition, essential to the acquisition, tin\u2014provement, expansion, or replacement of thehealth care facility or equipment concerned)of $100,000 or more, had been made duringthe three-year period. ended December 17,1970.Mr. CURTIS. Mr. Preident, this Is acorrective and clarifying amendment. Ihave submitted It to the chairman of thecommittee, and I think that he mightaccept It. I yield to him for such com-ment as he should like to make.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, it is my un-derstanding that this amendment is sortof a grandfather provision, Involving aclarification of intent as the Senator hasstated. It was not considered by the com-mittee. but I see no reason why we couldnot agree to It.Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, will theSenator yield?Mr. I yield.Mr. JAVITS. Should we know some-thing about it?Mr. CURTIS. The bill provides thathereafter, In determining reimbursementto a hospital for medicare services, theyshall disregard any allowances for cap-ital improvements that have been re-jected by a State planning agency.In many States, the State planningagencies are just now being brought intoexistence. Some of the staff were of theopinion that this amendment was notnecessary, but It provides that any carefacility which on December 18, 1970, wascommitted to a formal plan of expansionor replacement, the amendment shallDecember 28, 1970not affect. Such a beginning includessuch preliminary expenditures towardexpansionorreplacement,includingpayments for studies,surveys, designplans, drawing specifications, site acqui-sition, improvements and expansion andreplacement. In other words, if a hospitalhas plans underway on December 18,1970, this new rule that would excludefrom consideration their capital cost offacilities, would not apply.Mr. JAVITS. Is the department say.-ing this Is a big problem involved, mil-lions of dollars, or is it a modest prob-lem? I gather it affects particularly theSenator's State?Mr. CURTIS. In this particular case, itinvolves the Immanuel Hospital MedicalCenter in Omaha.Mr. JAVITS. I have no objection. It isa matter of a modest expansion.Mr. CURTIS. They have spent millionsof dollars on an expansion which is justnow getting underway. This hospital Isfaced with a technical ruling of the Hill-Burton board, made some years ago, en-tirely outside the purview of what thislanguagecontemplates,which mightcreate problems if amendnTent isnot agreed to.Mr. JAVITS. I meant universally forthe country, is there a problemMr. CURTIS. I think not.Mr. JAVITS. On that basis, I have noobjection.Mr.CURTIS.Mr. President, I ask fora vote on my amendment.The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Moss). The question is on agreeing to theamendment of the Senator from Ne-braska.The amendment was agreed to.AMENDMENT NO. 1106Mr. CURTIS. Mr. President\u2014The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does theSenator have a further amendment?Mr. CURTIS. I do. I call up my amend-ment No. 1106 and ask that It be stated.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment will be stated.The assistant legislative clerk read theamendment as follows:Beginning on page 213, line 17, strike out'PATMENTS TO HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANS-ZArioNs\" andallof section 239 throughpage 225. line 23.Beginning on page 401, line 21, strike outall through page 402, line 11.Mr. CURTIS. Mr. President, I am will-ing to agree to a limitation of time.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, I ask unani-moos consent that, If the Senator Is will-ing, the time on this amendment belimited to one-half hour, the time to beequally divided, 15 minutes to a side.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is thereobjection to the request of the Senatorfrom Louisiana? The Chair hears none,and it Is so ordered.Who yields time?Mr. CURTIS. Mr. President, I yieldmyself such time as I shall require.Mr. President, this late in the yearand this late at night, it is difficult tomake decisions on any bill. Here is whatis Involved In the amendment: The billcarries provisions for what I term grouppractice of medicine. This would makeIt possible for an arrangement to beentered Into whereby the recipients ofCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014SENATENOT VOTING\u201434 December 28, 1970medical care and medicaid to be treatedas a group. In other words, instead ofthat individual doctor-patient relation-ship, they can Join an organization and,by contract with the Government, for aflat fee, they take care of all the group'smedical needs.I want to be fair about this, that itdoes not force group practice of medi-cine on the people generally. I do notcontend that. All I contend is that thisis the beginning of a move toward grouppractice of medicine.As I said a bit ago, when these pro-grams were inaugurated we were toldover and over again that they would al-ways be administered so as not to inter-fere with the individual doctor-patientrelationship.Now the costs have gone up; part of itis due to inflation and part to othercauses\u201460 percent to 70 percent of thecost of the problem is in labor\u2014but ingrasping for some way to cut down thecosts of government medical programsthe provision Is advanced.I have a fear that if we make this startIn group practice, it will be enlarged and,little by little, it will become compulsoryand we will be sacrificing quality forprice. Patients will be treated as groups;not as individuals.Well, Mr. President, I am concernedabout the patients. I think that anyonewho Is ill, particularly those who do nothave the resources to pay their own med-ical bills, should be treated as an indivi-dual, that they should consult with adoctor, with a free exchange of ques-tions and answers, and the doctor shouldadvise the patient of the treatment, hos-pitalization, operation, or whatnot thathe should have.This will make it possible, however, tocontract with groups and have a statedfee that will take care of all their ills.Some Senators have information aboutcompany doctors, whether It Is a doctorprovided by a railroad company, a min-ing company, or other company. It hasnever been as satisfactory as the un-dividual selection of a doctor and thestrict maintenance of that individualdoctor-patient relationship. This begin-ning of the group practice Is In here, notfor the purpose of improving the healthcare of the people of the country, but itis here to lower the cost.I am for lowering the cost anywhere itcan reasonable be done, but never bysacrificing the quality of care.I do not believe that if someone joinsan organization and that organizationcontracts with the Government and, fora stated fee, everything is taken care of,that that is as conducive to quality healthcare as the Individual practice of medi-cine.Again, Mr. President, I want to makeit abundantly clear that I do not contendthat this bill forces group practice onanyone. But It is the beginning.Now there are other things we can doto cut down the cost. Personally, I neverdid favor medicare for the extremelywealthy, but that is water over the dam.Instead of dealing directly with costs,such as doing something that will bringmore labor-saving devices into the hos-pitals, we are turning to a cheaper prac-CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEtice of medicine. Weare laying the foun-dation which could well lead to a sacri-fice of quality practice.Mr. COOPER. Mr. President, will theSenator yield?Mr. CURTIS. I yield.Mr. COOPER. Mr. President, can theSenator give an example of the way thisworks?Mr. CURTIS. An organization is cre-ated, which enters into a contract with adoctor or doctors. I do not know on whatbasis of the contract, but they contractto take care of the ills of their membersfor a stated fee.I have the feeling that it will result ina group practice that would be very muchlike being treated by a company doctor.We have heard much complaint aboutthat. It is a beginning which I believe isa mistake.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, the part ofthe bill that the Senator from Nebraskaseeks to strike was enthusiastically rec-ommended by President Nixon, whichwas approved by the House Ways andMeans Committee, agreed to by theHouse of Representatives and which theSenate Finance Committee also agreedto.Mr. President,thiscommittee ap-proved President Nixon's recommenda-tion, with the exception that It did put onsome necessary limitations to tighten Itup to prevent abuse.We are talking about people who couldsign a contract with a group known asa health maintenance organization. Wecould name many such groups. TheKaiser Health Foundation on the westcOast, for example, Is a type of healthmaintenance plan. They could, for ex-ample, possibly sign some sort of anagreement with the Ochsner Foundationin New Orleans If the doctors want toprovide such services. Or they could goto the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota If theywanted to form a health maintenanceorganization with doctors of all special-ties capable of providing any medicalservice one might want. They would pro-vide the medical services, and the Gov-ernment would pay 95 percent of whatit would cost on a per capita basis toprovide this individual with his medicarebenefits using present payment mech-anisms.Itisanticipated that these healthmaintenance organizations could savemoney. In some cases, they would findways to be more efficient. In other cases,they might use fewer hospital days be-cause they would be able to do better ifthe patient came for outpatient treat-ment rather than hospital treatment. Byproviding more efficient services, theywould hope to save some money in theiroperation and to provide either more orbetter medical care to the people whoare members of the health maintenanceorganization.Mr. SAXBE. Mr. President, will theSenator yield?Mr. LONG. I yield.Mr. SAXBE. Mr. President, is not themain thrust of this provision to keep peo-ple out of the hospital rather than to putthem in $80- and $100-a-day hospitalbeds?S 21243At the present time under medicare, anold person who is sick is almost forcedto go to the hospital to get adequate at-tention. So we have them under those cir-cumstances in a $75-a-day hospital bed.Almost anyone subiect to medicare hasone or more chronic conditions\u2014heart,arthritis, kidney, liver, stomach\u2014some-thing that he is going to have for therest of his life. He needs maintenance.He needs attention. He needs this on aregular basis in order to keep out of thehospital and to keep him doing some-thing, to keep him active, to keep himin with people.I believe the concept of this is so thatthey can band together to get this at-tention without having to go to a hos-pital and without having to let thischronic condition develop to the pointwhere it is serious.This is an effort to try to have plans ofthe type that have been adopted andwhich, I am sure, the HEW is contractingfor so that they can make a contractwith the doctors. It Is voluntary. Theydo not have to do it. They can say, \"Willyou give me the medical attention Ineed, not when I am sick, but when I amwell so that you can keep me well andkeep me out of that high-priced hospitalbed?\"I think it is a good thing. I am gladto see it included in the bill.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, the SenatorIs correct.As the Senator from Ohio has pointedout so ably, this offers the health main-tenance organization an opportunity tosay to people who would be eligible formedicare, \"We think we can offer yousomething better than medicare.\" If theGovernment agrees that this may be bet-ter for the patient and if they see nopossibility of abuse in it, then they wouldpay 95 percent of what they would payper capita at the present time to providethis care.The administration thinks that thisis a way to provide better care.Obviously the people who have beenworking in this area believe they havesomething better to offer.As the Senator mentions, there are sev-eral organizations already providing thiscare. The State of Ohio has a very fineorganization in Cleveland that provideshealth care of this sort.The administration feels that this typeof thing will grow as people find ways toprovide more efficient and hopefully bet-ter service on a voluntary basis, and ata savings for the most part, with the In-tent of providing better and more serv-ices to the people who participate in thisorganization.If we are in error, then a lot of goodpeople have made the same mistake. TheHouse of Representatives thought thiswas wise. We have drawn our provisioneven tighter than theirs.Mr. RANDOLPH. Mr. President, willthe Senator yield?Mr. LONG. I yield.Mr. RANDOLPH. Mr. President, thedistinguished manager of the bill andthe Senator from Ohio have alreadygiven the reasons for the committee pro-vision which includes possibilities for In- S 21244creased emphasis and utilization of out-patient care and facilities.I wonder if under the proposal In thebill as brought to the floor there Is astrict procedure for Federal approval ofa program or programs.Mr. LONG. Yes. There is provision inthis bill requiring Federal approval. Andthe purpose, of course, is to be very care-ful to make sure the beneficiaries wouldreceive high-quality care.Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, will theSenator yield me 2 minutes?Mr. LONG. Mr. President, I yield tothe Senator from Oklahoma.Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, I rise tooppose the pending amendment. I sup-port the statements made by the dis-tinguished chairman of the committee.One of the mistakes made when medi-care and medicaid were originally en-acted into law was that we thereby mas-sively increased the demand for healthcare but did not concurrently increasethe supply of health personnel andhealth facilities. Because of that mas-sive increase in demand without a con-current increase of supply, we virtuallyruptured the system.That is one of the reasons why thecosts of health care have continued togo up at a very alarming rate. There Ispresently a shortage of 50,000 doctors InAmerica and a shortage of nurses that Isgreater than that.We cannot, with the present financialdifficulties of medical schools and health-related schools, see where the Increasedpersonnel will come from. We have toincrease medical and paramedical per-sonnel In this country. We must increasethe facilities available. But we can alsodo much better with the present medicalpersonnel and paramedical personnel,and we can do much better in the useof present facilities than we are doing.We must do both. We must not only in-crease the supply but we must also havemore efficient use of present personneland facilities. We cannot do that unlesswe are willing to go Into prepaid andpreventive medical care. The provisionIn this bill starts us In that direction.It Is a good provision and I hope thepending amendment Is rejected a'nd thatwe will not require that a doctor be paidon the basis of a fee, but that paymentbe on a per capita basis. Then, we canmove toward prepayment and preventivemedicine and toward encouraging grouppractice on a voluntary basis.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, I yield backthe remainder of my time.Mr. CURTIS.

Mr. Presicient, I ask forthe yeas and nays were ordered.Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President,I ask unanimous consent that debate on thepending amendment be limited to 30m.inutes,equally divided between theSenator from Louisiana and me.The PRESIDING OFFICER, Is thereobjection? The Chair hears no objection,and it is so ol'del'ed.Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, I yieldmyself 5 minutes.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Oklahoma Is recognized for 5minutes.Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, I call theattention of Senators to a memorandumin support of my amendment No. 1115,which has been placed on the desks ofthe Senators. I will briefly state the pur-pose of the amendment. This Is a veryfundamental and Important amendment.Basically the amendment would 11-narice the automatic increases In socialsecurity benefits by increasing the tax-able wage base, as the House did, tofinance the automatic cost-of-living In-creases provided in the bill\u2014rather thanthe position of the Committee on Fi-nance which would, unless this amend-ment Is agreed to, finance the automaticcost-of-livingincreasesone-halfby raising the taxable wage base and ori-half by raising the tax rate.This is a fundamental and Importantamendment because if the Senate agreesto the Senate committee and rejects thepending amendment, the automatic cost-of-living Increases in social security ben-efits would not be financed on a progres-sive basis, that is, by raising the wagebase upon which social security benefitsare based. That would be entirely con-sistent with the determination to raisethe benefits at all, because wages gen-erally would have gone up by reason ofinflation. Otherwise, the Secretary wouldhave to make all sorts of detailed cal-culations and finance cost-of-living in-creases under social security by bothtax rate increases and an increase In thewage base.The social security tax system is a re-gressive system and it gets tougher andtougher for wage earners to bear. Thatis why In committee I supported anamendment which would begin now topay a portion of Increased social securitybenefits out of general revenues. Thatamendment was not agreed to, but Ithink eventually it will be agreed to, andit will have to be agreed to because Ithink we have reached the saturationpoint In the social security tax rate. Theburden has become too great for theworking man. Feeling that way, I offeredan amendment which would have fi- he shall, on or before August 15 of the years nanced a portion of the benefit Increasein which such determination Is made, report In the bill by raising the wage base to December 28, 197O CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATE S 21245$12,000. Presently the taxable wage baseunder the committee bill would stop at$9,000. Anyone making more than $9,000a year would not pay any more thanthose who make $9,000 a year and under.Furthermore, the social security taxrate is a regressive rate because it is aflat rate and not based on graduatedincome, even up to the committee $9,000wage base figure.Every time we can we should try tomake that tax rate more progressive andmake that burden more evenly distrib-uted on the basis of ability to pay, aswe envisioned generally the income taxsystem would do. That Is what thisamendment would do.The amendment does not get into thequestionofwhethersocialsecurity would be financed from general reve-nues, and it does not get into the ques-tion of presently raising the taxable wagebase. It does provide that when cost ofliving increases go into effect automati-cally under this bill, as they would dohere under either the bill adopted bythe Senate committee or by the House,that increase which comes about by rea-son othe fact that wages have goneup and the cost of living has gone up,would be financed by raising the tax-able wage base, and then, the Committeeon Finance, and the Ways and MeansCommittee, of the Senate and the House,could,iftheywanted,recommendchanges in the law with respect to taxrates, wage bases, increased benefits, or whatever. But the automatic cost oflivingincreases,unless Congressdid something to the contrary, by raising thewage base and not the rate, would takea step forward toward making the socialsecurity tax system more progressivethan It Is.Mr. President, I think this provision isdesperately needed.Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, will theSenator yield to me?Mr. LONG. Mr. President, I yield 2minutes to the Senator from Iowa.Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, I shouldpoint out that the Senator from Okla-homa in so many words has suggestedthat we do away with the fundamentalconcept of social security and social in-surance, and make it into a welfare plan.This regressive feature of social securityis something that has existed ever sincesocial security went on the books, andproperly so. Regardless of income, peopleput In a certain amount of tax moneyeach year, and the employer matches iteach year. As a result, contributors canlook forward to the day when they willreceive, under insurance annuity typetables, a series of benefits.If the Senate wants to do away withthe concept of social insurance and makesocial security a welfare program, it might as well do away with all social se-curity taxes and make everything sub-ject to the general fund in the Treasury.That argument has been made throughthe years and it has been consistentlyrejected through the years.The Committee on Finance was verymuch aware of this problem. We found,upon advice from the Commissioner ofSocial Secirity, that just because thereIs inflation which might Increase thecost of living which would warrant in-creases insocialsecuritybenefits,it did not necessarily mean that therewould have to be an increase in eitherthe wage base or the tax rates becauseit has been shown that during inflation-ary periods the general level of wagesrises somewhat faster than prices andthe revenue increases resulting from theincreased wage rates might pay for theincreased cost under the automatic in-crease provision.The Finance Committee reached acompromise. The compromise reachedwas to let the financing come half froman increase in wage rates and half froman increase in tax rates. A good argu-ment could be made for having the en-tire amount come from wage rate in-creases.The committee arrived at a reasonablesolution. It was a compromise solution.I would like to see it stay the way it is.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Whoyields time?Mr. I'IARRIS. Mr. President, I yieldmyself 2 additional minutes.This amendment does not involveanything more than trying to make theautomatic cost-of-living increase reflectin its financing, as the House-passed billwould do, the inflation in wages and inother costs, simply by raising the tax-able wage base, which, under the Sen-ate version, would be $9,000, each timeit was necessary to do so in order to payfor the cost-of-living increase.The committee proposal would raisethe social security tax rates even thoughthat was unnecessary, and even thoughthat would, as generally would be thecase, overfinance the cost-of-living in-creases. Normally, as the Commission-er of Social Security would testify, thenormalcost-of-livingincreaseunder the bill would be paid for by the samekind of increase in the taxable wage base.It would not be necessary to increasethe tax rates, which are already regres-sive. The taxation is already too burden-some on the ordinary taxpayer. We wouldnot have to do that. That would over-finance it by and large. All that wouldbe necessary to pay the cost of livingwould be to increase the taxable wagebase. That is what the House bill woulddo. That Is what my amendment, ifadopted, would do.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, I yield my-self 2 minutes.The Senator's amendment is based onthe assumption that wages will rise twiceas fast as the cost of living. That as-sumption might be correct, and thenagain it might not. If the assumptiondoes not prove out, then there would notbe adequate financing to carry these cost-of-living increases.Furthermore, one could make the ar-gument that under the social securityprogram, the people who pay the leastreceive by far the most. For example, inthe very bill we have before us, the min-imum social security benefit would be$100 a month. Of course, it stands to rea-son that in the future we will furtherincrease the minimum social securitybenefit even more than we raise the av-erage benefit for others. So the person atthe lower average income level does geta far better buy for the money than theperson in the upper brackets.The Senator's proposal provides thatthese increases would not mean any taxincrease for anybody except those in thehigher wage brackets. They would bepaying all the taxes to pay for the auto-matic increases in benefit levels neces-sary because of increases In the cost ofliving.It could well be argued as being a caseof bearing down altogether too hard onthe relatively few who are paying at thetop rate for socail security for the bene-fit of those who are paying at the lowestrate.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator's 2 minutes have expired.Mr. LONG. I yield myself 1 minutemore.It was the view of the committee thatwe should not permit the Secretary ofHealth, Education, and Welfare, withoutthe consent of Congress, to use the sur-pluses that would otherwise flow into thefund; we did not wish him to have theleverage to change his actuarial assump-tions and provide additional benefitswhich might not be financed. It is ourjudgmentthat,under theSenator's amendment, that could happen and thatis one of the things we wish to protectourselves against.It was the judgment of the committeethat we should have an increase in theincome from the social security tax tofinance exactly the increased benefitsthat would be paid out, reserving to Con-gress the right, if it chose to do so, topass additional benefits, or further lib-eralize the program in other ways afterthe committee has had the opportunityto consider the problems presented andto have the House and Senate vote onits recommendations.Just one additional word. It was thethought of those of us on the committeethat, although there would be automaticbenefit increases as envisioned by thebill\u2014and as we support it in our bill\u2014we do not feel these should be all theincreases or all the additional benefitsthat will be voted in the future. In fact,it is our thought that, in all probabilityfor the foreseeable future, we may stillwish to pass a social security bill at leastonce every Congress to take care of thevarious needs that arise In addition totaking care of the cost of living, and wemay wish to consider the various prob-lems, recommendations and suggestionsthat can be brought to our attention byMembers in both parties.Mr. HARRIS. Mr.President, howmuch time do I have remaining?The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Oklahoma has 7 minutes re-maining.Mr. HARRIS. I yield myself 2 minutes.First of all, let me just say again thatI think the cost of living provisionsadopted by the Senate Finance \u00e7.ommit-tee were generally good. I think the ad-ditions the committee made with respectto keeping within its own jurisdiction thequestion of whether the committee wouldwant from time to time to go furtherthan the automatic cost-of-living In-creases would go are good. But I do notbelieve the automatic method of financ- S 21246 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEDecember 28, 1970ingtheautomaticcost-of-livingin- creases is in the spirit of progressivetaxation.I think, furthermore, as I said earlier,it should be pointed out that the Senatecommittee provision would require anautomatic increase in tax rates, therebyoverfinancingthecost-of-livingin- cases, and overfinancing the bill, obvi-o usly. therefore unnecessarily.There is one other aspect which shouldbe here, My amendment would provide,on an automatic basis, what has beenpretty much the ad hoc action of theCongress from time to time in raising thewae base. We started with a wage basebock in 1951 of $3600. That base hasbeen raised from time to time, as wageshave gone up and the cost of living hasone up, to $7,800. and under the presentbillthe taxable wage base would beraised to $9,000.That is important not only to try toget more progressiveness in the socialsecurity tax system, which, as I said, isdesperately needed, but raising the tax-able wage base from tUne to time to re-flect the rise in wages is important tokeep from having a deterioration in thecoverage.As wages have gone up since the wagebase was fixed at $3,600, and, as the Sen-ate and the Congress from time to timehave increased the wage base to $7,800,and now it is proposed to raise it up to$9,000. if we had kept the wage base towhere it was fixed originally at $3,600,beneficiaries would not really have hadthe kind of coverage and benefits theyought to have had and thei'e would havebeen a deterioration in the coverage andin the value of the benefits. In otherwords, the benefits would not really haveincreased to the degree they should havein order for the person receiving them tostay where they had become accustomedto, according to the cost of living andthe rise in wages.Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, will theSenator yield for a question?Mr. HARRIS. I am glad to yield.Mr. MILLER. The Senator has said atleast twice that what the bill providesfor is potential overflnancing. It was myclear understanding during the delibera-tions of the committee, coupled with theadvice from Mr. Ball, the Commissionerof Social Security, that there is discre-tion provided in the bill for the SocialSecurity Administrator to increase thewage base and the tax rate only so muchas is necessary to finance the increasedbenefits, and that if we did not put thatdiscretion in there, then there could beover-financing. So that was a bridge thatwe reached in the committee that Mr.Ball advised us not to cross, and theFinance Committee went along with him.So I believe the Senator from Okla-homa has misinterpreted the commit-tee's action on this point. I was verymuch concerned that we not overfinanceand not overtax, and I believe the billleads that way.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator's time has expired.Mr. HARRIS. I yield myself an addi-tional minute.I respectfully disagree with the Sen-ator from Iowa. I refer him to the Corn-missioner of Social Security. The pres-ent tax system in this bill for financingautomatic cost-of-living increases fromincreases in the pay ratio will greatlyoverfinance it over the actuarial longrun. The question is whether it financesthe first year the exact amount neces-sary, and that is the problem, becauseover the long teriri, then, it will overbur-den and overtax the working men andwomen of this country, who are alreadypaying much more than their fair shareof taxation, both under the income taxsystem and under the social security taxrate.The tax under social security must bemade more progressive. It must keep upwith the cost of living and with risingwages, and that is why the Senate andCongress, from time to time, have raisedthe taxable wage base. That is why, inmy opinion, Mr. President, the House ofRepresentatives was quite right in say-ing that the automatic cost-of-living in-creases should be automatically financedby raising the wage base, not by increas-ing the tax rate, which is already re-gi'essive and too burdensome.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Whoyields time?Mr. MILLER. Will the Senator fromLouisiana yield me a minute?Mr. LONG. I yield the Senator fi'omIowa 1 minute.Mr. MILLER. Istill believe there isa basic difference of opinion here, andthat is that the Senator from Oklahomaclaims this is going to overfinance andovertax, and I repeat that the FinanceCommittee had the clear understandingthat it would not do so. As a matter offact, this was a point I raised in thecommittee, because I did not want over-financing and ovei'taxing.Mr. Ball told the committee we oughtto have a provision in here which wouldpermit a discretionary amount, and thatif thei'e was an increase in benefits, thatwould not necessarily mean an increasein tax rates.The PRESIDING OFFICER, The Sen-ator's 1 minute has expired.Mr. MILLER. And the Social SecurityAdministration can compute all of thatout. So I think we are clear on that point.Mi'.HARRIS. Mr.President, howmuch time do I have i'emaining?The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Oklahoma has 2 minutes re-maining.Mr. HARRIS. I reserve that.Mr. LONG. How much time remainsto the opponents?The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six min-utes.Mr. LONG. I yield 2 minutes to theSenator from Delaware.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. Presi-dent, I hope the committee position willbe sustained and the amendment of theSenator from Oklahoma rejected. Thecommittee worked out what we consid-ered to be a very fair method of raisingtaxes to provide for these future in-creases. The raising of taxes is neverpopular, but if we must have them\u2014andwe must have them here\u2014we can onlyti'y to make them as equitable as possible.The committee felt it would be betterto put half of this prospective increaseon the wage base and half of it on therates. I think that would be much fairerfor all taxpayers concerned, and I cer-tainly hope that the amendment of theSenator from Oklahoma, with all due re-spect to him, will be rejected. If it isadopted it will create an inequity and putall the tax burden on one group of tax-payers rather than spreading it acrossthe board.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Whoyields time?Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, I yieldmyself the remainder of my time.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two min-utes.Mi'. HARRIS. Mr. President, I wouldsimply refer Senators to the social se-curity Commissioner and the actuariesthere. The facts are that if the taxablewage base is kept up to date with risingwage levels, there will be little if any needfor an inci'ease in the tax rate to coverthe cost of the automatic cost-of-livingincreases. I believe that, therefore, theHouse provision is a fairer one, moreequitable for the working men and wom-en of this counti'y, and I hope my amend-ment will be agi'eed to.Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, in Septem-ber 1969 the President sent to the Con-gress a message on social security. Amonghis recommendations for improvementsin the program were an increase in so-cial security benefits and automatic ad-justment of the benefits thereafter toincreases in the cost of living. I stronglysupport these recommendations.HR. 17550, now before us, is the cul-mination of long and careful considera-tion of the administration's importantand far-reaching proposals. Oie of themost important of the pi'ovisions in thebill is the automatic adjustment of socialsecurity benefits to insure that the pur-chasing power of those benefits will bemaintained, As the Pi'esident has said,the automatic adjustment provision \"willinstall new security in social security.\"Itwill provide peace of mind to thenearly 26 million beneficiaries on therolls and to those who come on in thefuture by assuring them that the benefitson which the vast majority of benefi-ciariesdependfortheirday-to-dayneeds will be kept up to date with risesin the cost of living.We have already provided for auto-matic adjustment in annuities for thecivil service and the military, and I havebeen looking forward to seeing the sameautomatic adjustments for our social se-curity beneficiaries. The Committee onFinancehas,however,made majorchanges in the automatic adjustmentprovisions that were proposed by thePresident and passed by the House ofRepresentatives. Two of these changeswould, in my opinion, negate the effect ofthe provision.First, the committee bill would re-quire the Secretary of Health, Education,and Welfare to promulgate increases inboth social security tax rates and thecontribution and benefit base in order tofinance the automatic increases in bene-fits, even though such increases in socialsecurity tax rates would be unnecessary.The reason why such increases would notbe necessary is that the cost of the auto- December 28, 1970matic benefit increases can be met fromadditional income that results from ris-ing earnings levels without increasing thetax rates, provided the contribution andbenefit base is increased from time totime. In fact it is estimated that underthe committee bill the social security sys-tem will be increasingly overfinanced aswe move into the future. A responsibleCongress could not permit a situation tocontinue under which the long-rangesurplus of the social security trust fundswhich develops from rising wage levelswould grow larger each year and at thesame time the contribution and benefitbase and the tax rates would be increasedby the Secretary to meet the cost of theautomatic benefit increases that wouldoccur over the years. The Congress un-questionably would act to take care of thesurplus\u2014either by stopping the increasein the contribution and benefit base orthe tax rates, or both, or by increasingbenefit levels over and above the increaseprovided under the automatic provisions,or by otherwise improving the programto use up or reduce the surplus. In fact,the Secretary of Health, Education, andWelfare might well be promulgating atax increase while the administrationwas recommending a cut in social secu-rity taxes\u2014a ridiculous situation, as I amsure my colleagues will agree.Second, the provision for automaticIncreases in the contribution and benefitbase to take account of increases inwages as proposed by the administra-tion would not delegate to the executivebranch authority to levy taxes, as hasbeen alleged. The increases In the basewould be automatic, and the determina-tion of the amount of the increase wouldbe routine on the basis of wages creditedto social security wage records. The com-mittee bill, on the other hand, woulddelegate authority to levy taxes. It re-quires that the Secretary of Health, Edu-cation, and Welfare determine the costof each automatic benefit increase inorder to determine what increase in thebase would be needed. If that determina-tion involved not only the short-rangecost but also the long-range cost, manyfactors involving discretionary selectionof assumptions would be required, In-cluding assumptions about long-rangefuture mortality rates, fertility rates, theproportion of total population in em-ployment covered by social security, thesize of taxable payroll, the size of thepopulation insured for benefits under theprogram, the proportion of the popula-tion that is married, the proportion ofeligible people who are beneficiaries, therate of labor force participation by wom-en, administrative expenses, and inter-est rates. Under the committee provision,not only would the Secretary and hisstaff be making egtimates involving judg-ment in each one of the areas mentioned,as must be done for the purpose of mak-ing cost estimates, but he would besetting the tax rates for the social secu-rity program based on these judgments.We would in effect be turning over to theSecretaryof Health, Education, andWelfare the tax-setting function of theCongress.The provision for automatic IncreasesIn the contribution and benefit base rec-CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEommended by the President rd ap-proved by the House would merely carryout automatically the policy which theCongress has been following on an adhoc basis since 1950\u2014that is, periodicallyincreasing the social security contribu-tion and benefit base so as to cover thesame proportion of total payroll as hadbeen covered earlier, when wage levelswere lower. As wages have risen, the$3,600 base that became effective in 1951has been changed by the Congress, insteps, to $7,800\u2014more or less as it wouldhave been under the automatic provisions,I should mention that the base mustbe increased to keep up to date with ris-ing wages not only from the standpointof the income of the program, but to pie-vent a deterioration in the earnings cov-ered by the program. For example, a jobwhich paid $3,600 in 1950 pays around$9,000 today. If the base had not beenincreased over the years the benefits pay-able to a man in such a job would pro-vide a much smaller proportion of wagereplacement than was provided whensocial security benefits first became pay-able and there would have been a majordeterioration in the protection affordedby the program.In the past, average wages have in-creased about twice as fast as the con-sumer price index. If the base is kept upto date with rising wage levels, as in theadministration's proposal, there is noneed for any increase in the tax rates tocover the cost of the automatic cost-of-living increases.I, therefore, wish to urge that amend-ment No. 1115, offered by Senator HARRIS,be adopted. This amendment would bringthe committee bill back in line with thePresident's proposal for automatic ad-justment of benefits and the contributionand benefitbase. Under the Harrisamendment, as under the administra-tion'sproposal,the contribution andbenefit base would rise automatically aswages rise. In each year in which theSecretary determines that a cost-of-liv-ing benefit increase or an increase in thecontribution and benefit base is to be ef-fective for the following year, the Sec-retary would be required on or beforeAugust 15 of the year in which the deter-mination is made to report to the Con-gress the amounts so determined. Hewould also Indicate whether, accordingto the actuarial estimates published inthe annual report of the board of trusteeson the previous March 1, the proposedincrease in the base would be sufficient,or more or less than sufficient, to coverthe long-range cost of the automatic in-crease in the benefits. He would have noauthority to promulgate any Increaseother than that dictated by the increasein wages.The Harris amendment would notchange the provision In the committeebill under which the automatic provi-sions would not take effect if in the yearbefore the year in which the increaseswere to be effective a bill had beenenacted that would either increase so-cial security benefit levels or revise theschedule of social security tax rates orthe contribution and benefit base. Theautomatic adjustment provision, then,S 21247takes nothing from the power of theCongress. It does serve as a backup toassure that social security beneficiarieswill be protected from th ravages of in-flation when the Congress does not act.And with the notification by the Secre-tary being required by August 15, theCongress would have ample time to inter-vene if, for example, a promulgated in-crease in the base was higher than neces-sary to cover the cost-of-living increasein the benefits, or if the Congress wishedto provide a benefit increase that washigher than that provided under the au-tomatic provision. Under such a provisionthere would be no delegation of func-tion from the Congress to the executivebranch.I urge all of you to join me in support-ing this amendment, an amendment thatwill insure effective implementation ofthe automatic adjustment provisions inHR. 17550.Mr. LONG.

Mr. President, I would like to propound a unanimous-consent request, that there be a 20-min-utetimelimitation on the pendingamendment to be equally divided betweenthe author of the amendment and themanager of the bill.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is thereobjection to the request of the Senatorfrom Montana? The Chair hears none.and it is so ordered.Mr. PROUTY. Mr. President, on June18, 1968, I introduced S. 3654, a bill re-ferred to the Senate Finance Commit-tee, an early version of the Older Ameri-cans Income Assurance Act.On March 6, 1970, I reintroduced thebill, S. 3554.Briefly, the measure simply assures aminimum income to individuals age 65or over of $150 per month\u2014$200 for agedcouples. Payment would be administerlas part of the social security system andfinanced out of general revenues.Mr. President, a 3-percent income taxsurcharge is provided to raise the addi-tional necessary revenue.Under this proposal, more than $650million would be gained in revenue forthe States. So, in effect, this Is a revenue-sharing plan as well as a guaranteedIncome plan for our elder citizens.Mr. President, I think it is significantthat nearly every one of our 50 StatesIs facing a serious financial crisis. Pres-ident Nixon sent us a revenue sharingproposal over a year ago. That proposalis among the unfinished business of thisCongress. It is interesting to note thatadoption of my Older Americans IncomeAssurance Act would entail a revenuegain for each State so as to help meetthe financial crisis affecting all States.Mr. President, between 6 '/2 and7 mil- lion people age 65 or over would receivepayments under this proposal. Upon en-actment an immediate result would bethat over 20 percent of those now living inpoverty would be moved out of povertyas a result of payments bringing theirIncome up to a nonpoverty level.In addition, over2.1million olderAmericans receiving old-age assistanceunder welfare would in effect be takenoff the welfare rolls and receive greaterbenefits under this proposal. For those2.1 million senior citizens, the average in-dividual cash gain would be $76.32 permonth.Mr. President, let me point out that anexplanation ofthis amendment withvarious charts and tables has been dis-tributed and is on the desks of all Sen-ators at the present time.I ask unanimous consent to have themprinted in the RECORD following my re-marks.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Withoutobjection, it is so ordered.(See exhibit 1.)Mr. PROUTY. The Older AmericansIncome Assurance Act will cost approxi-mately $4 '/, billion a year. It is estimatedthat the 3 percent income tax surchargewill cover the cost of the amendment.Mr. President, this proposal is a fairapplication of an income maintenancesystemadministeredbytheFederal Government.Both earned and unearned cash in-come received by an individual would besubtracted from $150 per month, or$1,800 per year, and the difference wouldbe paid under the Older Americans In-come Assurance Act.Let me cite some examples:An unmarried individual age 65 or overreceives a minimum social security bene-fit of $64 a month. He also receives $16a month interest on his savings in thebank. His total income is $80 a month.Under the Older Americans IncomeAssurance Act he would also receive $70a month to bring his income up to $150a month or $1,800 a year.Mr. President, let us examine the caseof an aged couple who have a combinedincome of $100 a month from a privatepension. That is their only income butthey own their own house.Under the Older Americans IncomeAssurance Act, since the couple's homewould not count as income because it isa nonincome producing asset, they wouldbe entitled to $100 a month in order tobring their annual income up to $2,400a year.Carrying that example one step fur-ther, suppose the couple sell their housein 1972 for $10,000. In such a situationthey would be ineligible for benefits in1972, but they could receive benefits In1973 assuming that their income was lessthan $2,400 that year.In other words, the effect of my pro-posal would be to guarantee every olderAmerican a reasonable level of cash In-come.I think this is extremely Important,Mr. President, because for older Ameri-cans the solution to poverty is not jobtraining or more education. The solutionIs simply cash Income.To date we have not solved the prob-lems of poverty for older Americans.On December 16, the U.s. Departmentof Commerce released a report based onthe recent census concerning consumerIncome. Among other things that reportshowed that In the past decade we havereduced the number living in povertyby nearly15.2million. However, Mr.President the in the number ofthose living In poverty came entirelyfrom those under age 65.For those over age 65 the number livingIn poverty has actually increased. Over55 percent ofthesingleindividualstrapped by poverty are over age 65. Intotal between 6 '/2and7 million peopleage 65 or over have cash incomes belowthe poverty threshold.The Depcrtment of Commerce used apoverty threshold which took into ac-count increased cost of living. For singleindividual age 65 or over the thresholdincomewas $1,749.For an aged couplethe threshold income was $2,194.Undermy Older Americans IncomeAssuranceAct single individuals age 65orover would havetheir cash incomebrought up to $1,800 a year thereby re-moving all of them from the abject pov-erty category and aged couples wouldalsoberemoved from poverty by bring-ing theirincome up to$2,400 a year.On September 22, I testified before theFinance Committee urging adoption ofa number of amendments. I am pleasedto note thatthe committee saw fit toadoptmy amendment calling for a $100minimum monthly payment and a 10-percent benefit increase.I regret that the committee did notgrant the same 10-percent benefit in-crease to beneficiaries receiving the so-called Prouty payment. As you know, Mr. President,there are approximately 640,-000individuals, now age 75 or older, re-ceiving special benefits as a result of myamendment to the Tax Adjustment Actof 1966. That amendment provided aspecial payment of $35 per month for in-dividuals not otherwise eligible for socialsecurity and who were age 72 by 1968.More than 1.5 million individuals havereceived that benefit which under pres-ent law Is $46 per month. The other bodygave the Prouty beneficiaries the same5-percent benefit increase given regularsocial sercurity recipients. Unfortunatelythe Finance Committee retained that 5-percent increase even though other socialsecurity recipients were given a 10-per-cent increase.Since I do not want to now delay pass-age of this bill I shall make equal treat-ment for Prouty payment beneficiariesmy first task in the 92d Congress.Finally, I am pleased to see that thisbill liberalized the earnings limitationon the so-called retirement test. I hadhoped that the Finance Committee wouldhave gone along with my amendmentNo. 698 In fixing the earned limitationat $2,400. However, the committee's ac-tion Increased this to $2,000 which is astep forward. I know that several col-leagues have introduced amendmentsIdentical to my amendment No. 698. Iwant to assure those Senators that Iwill give my full support to any amend-ment increasing the earnings limitationto $2,400 a year. After all this body hastwice before passed amendments goingto that figure.Finally, I want to congratulate thecommittee on Increasing widow's benefitsfrom 821/2 to 100 percent of the husband'sbenefits. This Is a reform I have beenproposing for nearly 10 years. Its adop- S 21250 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEDecember 28, 1970tion by both the House and the Senateis long overdue.EXPLANATION Paou-ry in-troduced S. 3654. a bill referred to the Sen-ate Finance Committee, an eariy version ofthe Older Americans Income Act.On March (S. 3554).PRO individuals age or overof $150 per month ($200 for aged couples).Payments would be administered as part ofthe Social Security System and financed outof general revenues. A 3 percent income taxsurcharge is included to raise the necessaryadditional revenue.ADVANTAGESMore than $650 million would be gainedrevenue for the state. (See charts E and F).Between 6'/2and 7 million people agesixty-five or over would receive paymentsunder the Prouty proposal.Over 20% of those now living in povertywould be moved out of poverty as a resultof payments under the Prouty Proposal.Over 2.1 million older American receivingold age assistance under welfare would ineffect be taken off the welfare rolls and re-ceive the greater benefits under the ProutyProposal.Nationwide, the average Individual cashgain for those now on welfare would be$76.32 per month. (See chart C).MOW rr WORKSBoth earned and unearned cash Incomereceived by an individual would be sub-tracted from $150 per month, or $1,800 peryear. and the difference would be paid underthe Older Americans Income Assurance Act.EXAMPLES1. Mary Jones who is unmarried receivesa minimum Social Security benefit of 864 amonth. She also receives Interest on her sav-ings in the bank, $16 a month.

Mr. President, the sharpcutting edge of inflation has hit the sen-ior citizens of this country who arepresumed to be living in their goldenage. They bought protection through so-cial security at the time they were mem-bers in the 1930's. The small amountthey paid into social security from theirpay checks was a large amount in thosedays. The payrolls of that time averagedfrom $15 to $75 a week. Today thesepeople who are collecting social security,If they have no other means of support,are public charges.This amendment attempts to live upto the promise we made to these peoplewhen social security became a part ofour law in 1935. What the amendmentwould do would be to say to them thatthere is a minimum wage for older peo-ple over 65 and that they will receive$2,400asacouple,or$1,800as an individual.This is a floor. If they receive moneyfrom pension funds or from other re-tirement programs, of course it will bestricken, because this is the floor. It willhelp substantially the States that arenow in dire financial circumstances.The PRESIDING OFFICER. All timeof the Senator from Vermont has ex-pired.Mr. SAXBE. Mr. President, how muchtime was there?The PRESIDING OFFICER. Therewas10minutes. The Senator fromLouisiana has control of the time.Mr. PROUTY. Mr. President, will theSenator yield us 5 minutes?Mr. LONG. Mr. President, I yield tothe Senator from Vermont.Mr. PROUTY. Mr. President, I yieldto the Senator from Ohio.Mr. SAXBE. Mr. President, the totalamount involved is such that it would aidthe States that are now in dire financialcircumstances. It is for that reason thatI joined in this amendment rather thanoffer the one that I have at the deskwhich I do not intend to call up, whichwould provide $155 a month to thesepeople.I feel that we have an obligation tosee that those people who paid theirsocial security get the insurance whichthey thought they were getting at thetime social security became a law andbefore inflation took a great deal of itout from under them.I admit that this is an advanced pro-gram, and one that I wish had moretime for consideration.I believe that it is an attempt to liveup to our promises to these people and isa genuine attempt to relieve the Statesof the great financial burdens they findthemselves under which, under the orig-inal concept of social security, was nevercontemplated.I believe that by adjusting this pro-gram to the other benefits which theyhave coming in, we will in the long runhelp to pay off out' obligations and atthe same time not send that money intothose hands where it is not needed.A $2,400 payment per couple today isa bare minimum for existence. I havebeen in the homes of those people whoare trying to live on this money. Thosepeople thought at one time that theywere secure with a small amount ofsavings and perhaps a home that waspaid for,feeling that socialsecurity would take care of them.They now find it slipping away dayby day, month by month, and year byyear until they reach the point wherethey are a public charge.I think they are entitled to somethingbetter. Therefore I feel that this programas contained in this amendment Is anobligation that we should try to live upto.Mr. METCALF. Mr. President, may wehave order?The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. PAcKwooD). The Senate will be in order.Let there be order in the Chamber, sothat the Senator from Ohio may beheard.Mr. PROUTY. Mr. President, I invitethe attention of the chairman of theFinance Committee, Mr. LONG, I realizethat at this late hour, even if the Senatewere to approve my amendment, theHouse conferees would be very reluc-tant to consider a program of this mag-nitude. I have discussed this matter withmy distinguished colleague, the Senatorfrom Ohio and we feel that under thepresent circumstances we perhaps shouldwithdraw the amendment. However, be-fore we do so, we would like to have theassurances of the distinguished chair-man of the Finance Committee that nextyear when this billis reintroduced, itwill be given very serious considerationby the distinguished chairman and othermembers of the Finance Committee.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, I yield my-self 2 minutes.Mr. President, the Senator has longhad a great interest in older Americans.I very much appreciate his interest inthis matter.I think his statement is correct, andthat at this late hour in this Congress,there would be no hope of persuading theHouse to agree. I think that the commit-tee would certainly like to consider thecost as well as some of the other featuresof the measure to see the extent to whichwe could agree to it. I do not think thatwe could agree to all of it. However, ifthe Senator would like to have hearingson the matter next year, I would be gladto accommodate him.Mr. PRQTJTY. Mr. President, I ap-preciate the Senator's willingness to giveattention to the matter.I might point out to the Senator thatunder this proposal the State of Loui-siana would in effect receive $24,975,000because it would not have to expend thatamount under the old age assistanceprogram.Thisisarevenue-sharingmeasure as well as a provision to guar-antee income for older Americans.I think our proposal merits carefuland serious consideration. I will be gladto appear before the Finance Committeenext year and hopefully persuade mycolleagues on that committee to reportthe Older Americans Income AssuranceAct.Mr. President, with the agreement ofthe distinguished Senator from Ohio,I withdraw the amendment.The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I askunanimous consent that there be a timelimitation of not to exceed 20 minutes,the time to be equally divided betweenthe Senator from Illinois and the dis-tinguished Senator from Utah.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is thereobjection? The Chair hears none, and itis so ordered.Mr. PERCY. Mr. President, I ask forthe yeas and nays on my amendment.The yeas and nays were ordered.Mr. PERCY. Mr. President, I shouldfirst like to commend the Finance Com-mittee and its able chairman as well asthedistinguishedrankingminority member for taking a good hard look atthe problem involved in people workingwhile they are drawing social securityand having a disincentive to continue towork because of an aibitrary limitationthat has been placed on them.I commend the committee on increas-ing the limitation. However, I think wemust be realistic and say that the limita-tion is still much too low.The amendmentIhaveproposed would Increase the current annual earn-ings limitation from $2,000, which is pro-vided for in the committee bill, to $2,400and would do so immediately. The provi-sion I had in my original amendmentthat I discussed with the committee andwhich I testified about would have In-creased it substantially and would at thesame time have phased It out over a pe-riod of 7 years.I recognize that the cost involved inphasing outtheearningslimitation might be exorbitant, though I think thatwe should do it sometime. I will continueto work toward this.I hope that the committee will do like-wise.The amendment I originally offeredwas partially accepted by the House ofRepresentatives and by the Senate Fi-nance Committee. By raising the earn-ings limitation to $2,000, with a $1 for$2 reduction In earnings above $2,000,and by eliminating the former $1 for $1reduction in earnings once a person be-gan making $2,880. the House and Sen-ate committees moved in the right di-rection. I commend them for this. I feelwe \u00e8an and should go further, however,by raising the limitation to $2,400.Since the social security program wasoriginally devised to provide a floor ofprotection against the loss of earningscaused by a worker's retirement, death,or disability, the so-called retirementtest was established to assure that aworker had, In fact, retired. Since socialsecurity was also never intended to pro-vide much more than a modest standardof living, an individual was expected tosupplement social security with individ-ual savings or a private pension plan. Aperson is allowed to keep full social se-curity benefits no matter how much hegets in dividends and interest from in-vestments or savings; but he cannot keepall of his earnings once he makes morethan $1,68C.All this is well and good, except thateven If a person does as he should andinvests in a private pension plan or insavings, this does not assure him an in-come. There Is a certain amount of truthin a remark made by Thomas R. Dona-hue, an Assistant Secretary of Laborduring the Johnson administration, whotold the Senate Labor Committee:In all too many cases the pension prom-ised shrinks to this: \"If you remain In goodhealth and stay with the same comoany liii-til you are 65 years old, and If the companyIs still In business, and if your departmenthas not been abolished, and if you haven'tbeen laid off for too long a period, and ifthere's enough money in the fund, and thatmoney has been prudently managed, you willget a pension.\"One private study of pension plan re-vealed that less than 10 percent of 60,000low-paid workers would ever receive apension benefit.What does a person do if all his sav-ings have been eaten away by inflationand his pension plan has collapsed orotherwise failed to provide his needs?All he can do Is try to supplement hisincome by working, yet under presentlaw, he is penalized for doing so.I now propose In this amendment toincrease the earnings limitation immedi-ately to $2,400. While I would like to seea total elimination of the retirement test,I think we must be realistic in recogniz-ing that this would be extremely costlyif done now. It is my understanding thatan immediate elimination of the \"test\"would cost between $2.25 and $2.50 bil-lion in the first year, which we all recog-nize we could not absorb.The Idea of removing the earningslimitation completely\u2014which i feel hasconsiderable rnerit\u2014shoiijd be studiedfurther by the Committee on Finance in1971.The cost of my amendment above thecommittee bill would be $280 million Inthe first year, and the \"level-cost\" wouldbe .08 percent of the taxable payroll.But because my amendment mightalso preclude the necessity for someaged persons to go on welfare, its addi-tional cost over the committee bill wouldbe offset to a certain extent.A full one-third of all social securityrecipients live at or near the povertylevel. By raising the earnings limitationto $2,400 instead of $2,000, I think wecould prevent some of these people fromhaving to go on welfare, and allow themto maintain their sense of dignity andindependence\u2014so important to all of us.Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, will theSenator yield?Mr. PERCY. I yield.Mr. Mr. President, I wish tosupport the Senator's amendment. TheSenator has had enormous experience inindustrial management. We have beenaspiring to do this for a long time. Theentire movement to longevity, we under-stand in geriatrics,isto keep peopleworking. This is the greatest Induce-ment in the world.As the Senator has stated, the cost ofhis amendment would be $280 million inthe first year, but the people involvedwill be encouraged to work which maywell cancel out what it will cost strictlyon an actuarial basis in social securitybenefits.Mr. PERCY. Mr. President, I thankmy distinguished colleague. Not only willthe Government get some of this moneyback in taxes, but the Federal Govern-ment and State and local governmentswill benefit by not having some of thesepeople go on welfare, and it is much more dignified to receive increases insocial security and to receive adjustedearnings, rather than have the humiliat-ingexperienceofacceptingwelfare which, many times, is beyond the controlof the recipient who thought he wouldhave adequate income to meet his needs.I do not think this is a costly amend-mew. Ithinkitisa humanitarianamendment.I commend the committee for movingin this direction. I ask that we move alittle further by raising the earningslimitation to $2,400. If a person receivedthe maximum social security and earnedthe minimum amount, he would still beat the poverty level.Mr. HARTKE. Mr. President, will theSenator yield?Mr. PERCY. I yield.Mr. HARTKE. Mr. President, I com-mend the Senator from flhinois. This isa step forward that needs to be taken. Ihave an amendment at the desk whichwould provide for a complete eliminationof the earnings limitation. Even thoughwe did increase the amount to $2,000, wedid accept an amendment which I putbefore the committee to eliminate theprovision for keeping 50 cents of eachdollar, which iscurrentlylimitedto $2700.I commend the Senator from Illinoisand I' hope the Senate agrees to theamendment.Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, will theSenator yield to me briefly?Mr. PERCY. I yield.PRTYILEGZ OP THE FLOORMr. JAVITS. Mr. President,I ask unanimous consent that John Scales, ofthe staff of the Committee on Labor andPublic Welfare, who isfamiliar withchild care matters, be permitted in theChamber.The PRESIDING OFFICER. .Withoutobjection, it is so ordered.The PRESIDING OFFICER, All timeof the Senator from Illinois has expired.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, this pro-posal and a number of other meritoriousproposals were considered by the com-mittee. It was felt that rather than havea number of modifications of the law,eh of which would cost a substantialamount, but not as much as the meas-ure voted in committee, it would be bestto vote for an across-the-board 10-per-centincrease,somethingthatcould benefit every social security beneficiary.In addition, we voted for the minimum December 28, 1970increase that the Senate voted earlierthis year.These are matters that I would like tovote for as I did for a number of otherpopular suggestions. The only problemis they all cost a lot of money and wemust choose which ones would be thebest way to benefit the most people in-volved. All factors considered, it is thejudgment of the committee that the 10-percent across-the-board increase andthe $100 minimum would be more mean-ingful to more people than the increasein earnings base that would be permis-sible without any reduction iii social se-curity benefits.I regret I cannot support the proposal.The committee went about as far as wecould in this area. The committee raisedthe limitation to $2,000 and eliminatedthe $1,200 limit on the $1 for $2 reduc-tion, so that the person loses $1 for every$2 he earns until he phases out his beiie-fit. But he would never get to the pointwhere heloses$1for$1earnings.Furthermore, the bill provides for anautomatic increase in the $2,000 exemp-tion. The committee did consider thisgeneral problem to meet the need of thesepeople.Mr. WILLIAMS ofDelaware.Mr. President, will the Senator yield?Mr. LONG. I yield.Mr. WILLIAMS ofDelaware.Mr. President,I recognize thereis much merit to the amendment of the Senatorfrom Illinois. However, the committeewas faced with the problem of how farwe should go in liberalizing the socialsecurity benefits. The bill now pendingbefore the Senate already increased thebenefits for social security by around$3.25 billion more than the House billprovided. The bill did that by raising thebenefits from 5 to 10 percent and, as theSenator from Louisiana pointed out, byputting in the amendment providing fora $100 minimum and raising the earn-ings limitation to $2,000.There is a limitation as to how far wecan go without additional financing. Forthat reason I hope the committee posi-tionwill be sustained and that theamendment will be rejected. Perhaps itcan be considered at a later time whenwe have more money. Right now wewould have to have a substantial increasein the tax rate over and above what thebill flow provides.Mr. LONG. I yield back the remainderof my time.Mr. PERCY. I yield back the remain-der of my time.The PRESIDING OFFICER. All timehaving been yielded back, the questionis on agreeing to the amendment of theSenator from Illinois (Mr. PERCY).

I am happy to yield.Mr. LONG. I would like to ask if theSenator is offering his amendment thathas to do with relative responsibility forblind persons, because if it does, we arewilling to accept the amendment.Mr. PERCY. Yes, that Is the firstamendment, and I am gratified at the in-dication that the committee chairman Isaccepting it.RELATIVE RESPONSIBILITYMr. President, I would like to call upmy amendment No. 1151 to HR. 17550which removes discriminatory provisionsof the Social Security Act applying toblind and permanently and totally dis-abled persons.At present, title XIX of the Social Se-curity Act\u2014medicaid\u2014in determiningeligibility for the extent of medical as-sistance to be available to individuals,states that \"the financial responsibilityof any individual for any applicant or re-cipient of assistance under the act shouldnot be considered unless such applicantor recipient is such individual's spouse orsuch individual's child who is under age21; or is blind or permanently disabled.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATETitles X and XVI\u2014grants to Slates forAid to the Blind; and Grants to Statesfor Aid to the Aged, Blind or Disabled,respectively\u2014also have the effect of al-lowing States the latitude to set up \"rela-live responsibility\" regulations. In otherwords, blind or permanently and totallydisabled persons over age 21 must, inmany cases, undergo the humiliating,degrading experience of proving to theState that their parents lack the finan-cial means, or the willingness, to meettheir medical\u2014or other\u2014needs.Nondisabled, needy adults are not sub-jected to this humiliating experience.Only the blind and otherwise disabled\u2014of whom there are about 82,000 and 600,-000, respectively, in the United States\u2014are singled out and expected to bankrupttheir parents.In most cases, when the parents orrelatives of adult blind or disabled chil-dren are able to offer assistance, theydo so willingly. When the parents arenot in a position to offer assistance, whatis the point of allowing States to say toa blind or disabled individual: \"Yourparents are responsible for your needs,but since they will not provide them, wewill not either.\" This makes no sense atall in my opinion.When one considers the hardshipscaused by blindness, and other dis- abilities, and the courage and self-con-fidence necessary to overcome handicapsso as to function in a dynamic society,it seems even more unfortunate that weask these people to face a humiliating,painful, and unnecessary experience be-fore qualifying for assistance they mightneed. The sense of independence andself-respect that a blind adult can ac-quire by knowing he is no longer a bur-den to his family may make a significantimpact on his level of aspiration andability to move forward into real in-dependence.The ability to perform successfully andto be a contributing member of society isa necessary foundation for the self-re-spect of a young blind or disabled adult.As he becomes no longer a burden to hisfamily, the improved attitudes and themore wholesome relationship betweenhim and his parents can be expected toresult in increased support and encour-agement from them. We thus will haveprovided the conditions under which aseriously handicapped person can aspireto freedom and achievement and canmove forward into real independence.I,therefore, urge support for thisamendment so that we can do away withthis glaring inequity and discriminationagainst blind and disabled citizens with-in our society.The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, at this'time I would like to call up my amend-ment No. 1166 to provide benefits forgrandchildrendependent upontheir grandparents. Under the present social December 28, 1970security law, some children who are de-pendent on their grandparents cannotobtain benefits based on their grandpar-ents' earnings. A grandchild must beadopted by his grandparents before hequalified for a child's social security ben-efits. This is most unfortunate, as thereare cases in which the grandparents, forvalid reasons, are either unable to ordo not wish to adopt the child, yet stillmaintain a quasi-parental relationship.The puflose of social security is toprovide the family with a continuingsource of income when the family in-come stops because of the death, retire-ment, or disability of a worker. Follow-ing this, social security benefits are paidto children whose parents have died, re-tired, or become disabled on the theorythat children are generally dependenton their parents and suffer a loss ofsupport when the parents' income stops.However, if that parent is a grandar-ent the child suffers in being denied asocial security benefit. Benefits are ex-tended to grandchildren only when theyare legally adopted.This distinction which prohibits theunadopted child living with and sup-ported by his grandparents from receiv-ing the same benefits he would receiveIf he were adopted is grossly unfair. Achild dependent on his grandparents Isas deserving of social security benefitsas is a child who is dependent on hisparents\u2014perhaps even more deservingas grandparents verypossibly wouldhave less income. The payment of thesebenefits should be based on the realitiesof the situation.I, therefore, urge favorable action onmy amendment to permit the paymentof social security benefits to the depend-ent grandchildren of disabled, retired, ordeceased workers when It can be shownthat the child is actually dependent forsupport upon the grandparents.My amendment redefines the term\"child\" so that benefits would be pro-vided for a grandchild if, at the time thegrandparents died or became entitled tobenefits, he had been living with thegrandparents at least 1 full year\u2014exceptin the case of death or disability of thegrandparent, within the same year asthe loss of support from the parents. Inaddition, it would have to be shown thatthe grandparents actually furnished atleast one-half of the child's support dur-Ing this time.Adoption of this measure would cor-rect an anomaly in the social securityprogram. It would make actual depend-ency the criterion for payments to agrandchild.Although this is not a major changewhen measured In terms of of the num-ber of people affected, it Is nonethelessa major change when measured by theeffect itwill have on the incomes ofthose individuals who will qualify forbenefits. Moreover, the social securityactuaries Inform me that because only arelatively few people could be expectedto qualify for benefits, adoption of theproposal would have no significant ef-fect on the total cost of the social se-curity program. The \"level-cost\" wouldbe .01 percent of the taxable payrolLPassage of the bill would eliminate theCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEneed for taking action on about 300 pri-vate bills annually.Mr. LONG.

Mr. President, I can dis-pose of this amendment quite quickly.The purpose of this amendment is toprevent private pension plans which arecorrelated with social security benefits,from charging the beneficiaries with theincreased social security benefit whichthey are going to receive in this and insuccccding increases by watering downthe private pension benefits which theyare entitled to receive.Last week, I had word from the Treas-uly Department by letter dated Decem-ber 16, which I read to the Senate, thatit appreciated the equity of this amend-ment and that under its own regulationsit was going to do exactly what thisamendment calls for. They end their let-ter, which is in the RECORD of Decem-ber 22, and signed by John S. Nolan, aDeputy Assistant Secretary, with thisstatement:In light of the foregoing, I believe thatthe amendment you have proposed to thepending Social Security bill Is unnecessary.As you may have been informed, we havesubmitted to the Olilce of Management andBudgetaproposedreportopposingthe amendment.Moreover, they stated in this letterthat they have changed their positionfrom the position taken on this matter onApril 28, 1967, in a letter which theyaddressed to Senator RANDOLPH, who wasthen chairman of the Subcommittee onEmployment and Retirement Incomes ofthe Senate Special Committee on theAged.This was the record until late lastweek when I read in the press that in astatement made to a newspaper reporter,they qualified their position by sayingthey were going to defer the applicationof their ruling until December 31, 1971.We checked back with the TreasuryDepartment and found that what ap-peared in the newspaper article was so,that they really had made that repre-sentation, although they had writtenme about a week before that my amend-ment was unnecessary because they weregoing to do this themselves.Mr. President, I ask unanimous consentthat the Treasury Department letter ofDecember 16 and the newspaper articleI had referred to, be Inserted in theRECORD at this point.There being no objection, the letterand article were ordered to be printed inthe RECORD, as follows:THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY,Washington, D.C., December 16, 1970.Hon. JACOB K. JAVITS,U.S. Senate,Washington, D.C.DEAR SENATOR JAvITs: ThIs is In reply tothe request of Mr. Gordon of your office forthe present position of the Treasury Depart-ment concerning the effect of increases In S 21256Social Security benefits upon benefits paidto retired employees under so-called offsetplans.Revenue Rulings 69\u20144 and 69\u20145, copies ofwhich are attached, provide specific rules fordetermining whether a pension, annuity,profit-sharing or stock bonus plan is properlyintegrated with Social Security benefits. Sec-tion 7 of Revenue Ruling 69\u20144 provides thatan offset plan (i.e., a plan under which anemployee's retirement benefit is reduced bya stated percentage of his Social Securitybenefit)is properly integrated only if therate at which the offset is computed does notexceed (1) 833 percent, if the offset i3 com-puted on the basis of the benefit to which theemployee would be entitled under the SocialSecurity Act as in effect in 1968, or (2) 75percent, if the offset is computed on thebasis of the benefit to which the employee isor would upon application be entitled underthe Social Security Act as in effect at the timeat which the offset is first applied. Thus, in-creases In Social Security benefits cannotresult in an Increase of the amount of theSocialSecurityoffset.This representsa change from the position in former AssistantSecretary Surrey's letter of April 28, 1967, tothe Honorable Jennings Randolph, Chair-man of the Subcommittee on Employmentand Retirement Incomes of the Senate Spe-cial Committee on Aging.In light of the foregoing, I believe that theamendment you have proposed to the pend-ing Social Security bill is unnecessary. As youmay have been informed, we have submittedto the Office of Management and Budget aproposed report opposing the amendment.Sincerely yours,JOHN S. NOLAN,Deputy Assistant Secretary.[From the Washington Post, Dec. 23, 1970JPENSION PLAN RULES REVISED To PROHIBITBENEFIT REDUCTIONSThe Treasury Department has revised itsrules In order to prohibit private pensionplans from reducing benefits when Social Se-curity payments go up.The change caine to light after Sen. JacobK, Javits (R-N.Y.)Introduced an amend-ment to the pending Social Security bill tostop the practice.Javits said he was troubled by complaintsafter last year's substantial Social Securityincreases that private pension plan benefitswere being watered down as a result.But Javits took to the floor yesterday toread a Treasury letter indicating the depart-ment has already barred the practice. Conse-quently, he Is withdrawing his amendment,Javit,s said.The prohibition applies strictly, however,to those workers who retire after Dec. 31,1971, according to a Treasury source. He saidit is \"conceivable\" that some persons alreadyretired might find, their pension benefits re-duced by Social Security increases. But thispractice is far less common today than for-merly, he added.The big push in corporate employee pen-sion funds came after World War II andlargely on the bargaining initiative of laborunions,notablytheUnitedAutomobile Workers under the late Walter P. Reuther.Most of these operated under a formula inwhich the employer made up the differencebetween Social Security payments and astated sum. Thus, If a union had negotiateda $100 a month pension benefit and a retireedrew $40 a month in Social Security, thecompany paid him $60.Any Increase in Social Security reduced theemployer's liability proportionately.The NationalAssociationof Manufac- turers and other business groups, which hadfought establishment of Social Security inthe mid-1930s, suddenly became its partisanswhen the first big improvements were votedin the early 19508.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEAs late as 1967 the offset practice was stillpermitted by Treasury, which has limited au-thority to regulate private pension fundsthrough its power to certify favorable taxtreatment for qualified plans.Javits said yesterday in his floor speech,\"It was appalling to me that in these infla-tionary times, the result of voting Social Se-curity increases was to deprive the retiree, byreduction of his other pension income\u2014ofthe very money he needed to cope with therising cost of living.\"In alettertoJavits, John S.Nolan, deputy assistant Treasury secretary for taxpolicy, advised that the regulations had beenrevised to limit such offsets to amounts basedon 1968 Social Security rates or those in effectat the time the reduction is first applied.\"Thus, increases in Social Security bene-fits cannot result in an increase of the amount of the Social Security offset,\" Nolanwrote.Mr. JAVITS. This indicates that wecannot rely upon the Treasury Depart-ment's regulations or its interpretationsof its regulations; but if we wish to acton this matter\u2014and they, themselves,have admitted its equity\u2014we have to acton it by legislation.It seems to me, in all honesty and un-der the conditions we face, that we arein this situation: I am compelled, by thefact that we are driving through to theconclusion of this bill, to bring up thisamendment even though I have not beenable to get an answer in writing fromthe Treasury Department as to the rea-sons for this change in the position theypreviously related to me. I have had todepend upon a phone call,I would hope very much that, underthe circumstances, the chairman couldsee his way clear to take the amendmentto conference and unravel it there. Thebest we have been able to get from theTreasury Department, is that they havenot adequately expressed their view orthat they have found something in theirregulations that causes them to changetheir view.There is no question about the equityinvolved\u2014that, insofar as the pensionerin this type of pension plan is concerned,if an increase in social security will leavehim no better off, because his privatepension income will be correspondinglyreduced. We give itto him with onehand, and private pension plans take itaway with the other.The Treasury Department has theability, under the tax law, to deal withthis, because they determine what is de-ductible for income tax purposes so faras pension contributions are concerned.So I think that the fair thing to dowould be to take this amendment toconference and unravel the situation.The Treasury said on December 16, 1970,that it is the right thing to do, that theyare going to do It, and that my amend-ment is unnecessary. Within a week, theybacktrack to reduce the force of theirown letter by approximately three-quar-ters. That Is our own estimate. That iswhat it results in.I believe, therefore, that since this is avery equitable matter\u2014as they, them-selves, have recognized\u2014we should, atlong last, enact into law the substanceof the Treasury Department position asoriginally expressed, and have our ownconferees\u2014who I am sure will feel asDecember 28, 1970solicitous as I do about retirees who haveboth forms of coverage, both private andpublic, in social security\u2014work it out ina way which would be equitable and fair,especially in view of the fact that theTreasury Department itselfhas con- ceded the main point.I reserve the remainder of my time.Mr. LONG. I yield myself 3 minutes.Mr. President, if the amendment issuch that the Treasury Department waswillingtoagree toit,but then re-neged on it after the Senator withdrewhis amendment, it presents some prob-lems. Unfortunately for those of us onthe committee, we were aware of the factthat the Senator had offered the propo-sal and also that he had withdrawn it,and therefore our staff, being busy withother matters involving this bill, simplystudied it no further.If the Senate wishes to do so, it wouldbe all right with the Senator from Loui-siana to take the matter to conference.I am frank to tell the Senator that thismay prove to be one of those complicatedareas in which the clock will run out onus even in conference and where the an-swer may not come easily. It would beall right with the Senator from Louisi-ana to agree to it, but I must say that wedo not understand it well enough to ad-vise the Senate how it should vote onthe amendment.Mr. JAVITS. Standing on the thresh-old of adjournment, and the fact that theTreasury Department agreed only a weekago and now is only backtracking, itseems to me that it could be resolved,and I would be willing to run that l'iSk.Mr. WILLIAMS ofDelaware.Mr. President, will the Senator yield?Mr. JAVITS. I yield.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I wouldnot want this amendment to go to con-ference under any illusions that someof us think we would bring it back aswritten.I recognize the points that the Sena-tor makes,.but if we accept this amend-ment there is a question as to whetherwe are changing rules for a thousandprivate pension plans without those com-panies having a chance to be heard.Many of the private pension plans areon the basis that they will give theiremployees, for example, x amount, orthe difference between whatever the so-cial security is and the agreed figure.A great deal of argument can be madefor the position of the Senator from NewYork, but he is changing the rules aftert.hese pension plans have been approvedby the Treasury Department. This couldbe done prospectively, but I question thewisdom of doing it retroactively.I do not understand the confusion ex-isting in the Treasury Department, be-cause it would be my opinion that theywould have no right under existing lawto do this by regulation. It would takelegislation.I would be willing to go along with thechairman that we take it to conference;but in all fairness I would only statethat in working it out, I can see problemsdeveloping here in which we may not beable to do it without coming back andgiving those who have these pensionplans an opportunity to be heard. With December 28, 1970 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATE S 21257that understanding I would agree to takeit to conference, but I do not want theSenator to think we are accepting thisamendment and that it can be workedout that easily.Mr. JAVITS. If the Senator will checkback on my presentation of the matterfirst, which I did on December 1, in put-ting the amendthent into the committee,I made It very clear that not many planswere involved. See CONGRESSIONAL REC-ORD,December1,1970, at S19078. Wehave the hearings of the Subcommitteeon Fiscal Policy of the Joint EconomicCommittee on that subject. So it is nota very dense problem in terms of thenumber of plans involved.The other point, which Is critically im-portant, is this: Nobody has a right, inany pension plan, to figure on social se-curity increases to the retiree.Mr. COOK. Mr. President, will theSenator yield?Mr. JAVITS. I yield.Mr. COOK. For the life of me, I can-not see why this should be very difficult,even in conference. I do not see how inthe world a corporation can build into apension plan the actuarial science ofcontemplating what social security in-creases will be in the future and say toan employee who pays into a pensionprogram for 30 years, 'You will receive$200 a month based on the fact that youwill receiye $150 In social security. Then,when your social security goes up to$170, your pension goes down to $180 amonth.\" There Is not an actuarial ex-pert In the country that could figurethat out. But now what they are doing isbuilding into a program benefits for thecorporation or the insurance company,so that at no time will we receive overx dollars between pension and social se-curity.Mr. JAVITS. It is nothing but a wind-fall proposition. The Treasury recognizesthat, but first they told us it was beingstopped right away and then they de-cided that they could not go that far.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. I am notprejudging the Senator's position, but Ipoint out some of the problems that canarise. I call attention to the fact thatCongress in its wisdom\u2014and Congressis always wise\u2014passed such a provisionIn the Railroad Retirement Act wherethis very same formula prevails. I do notknow what this would do to the Rail-road Retirement Act because the rail-road pension is based on the premisethat the employment will get x amountmade up by the railroads over and be-yond social security. We are locked in onthat pension plan by law.This law can be changed, but it doestake legislation.I say again that I am not prejudgingthis, but I would foresee that there canbe problems. Congress itself recognizedthat principle in the Railroad Retire-ment Act, and I do not know what effectthis would have on that plan. This pro-posal was not considered by the com-mittee. I am willing to go along with thechairman and take it to conference andnot prejudge it, but I do say that wemay not be able to work it out. I can fore-see problems which may require holdingit over for a little more careful study. Iwould have no objection to taking it toconference with that condition in mindwith the thought that we are not dump-ingit or prejudging it.Mr. JAVITS. The Railroad RetirementAct is not a Government program likesocial security. I am dealing only witha private pension fund and not at allwith the Railroad Retirement Act. It willhave no effect on railroad retirement.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Exceptthat the railroad retirement is not aGovernment Insurance plan; the Gov-ernment Is only the trustee. The plan Isfinanced in its entirety by millions ofrailroad workers, with the railroad pay-ing as the employer and payments beingmade by the employee. The employeegets x number of dollars in the pen-sion, of which social security a part. That is the theory of the Railroad Re-tirement Act.Mr. JAVITS. The distinguished Sen-ator must know that it does not qualifyunder the terms of my amendment as aprivate pension plan. That is all I amarguing. I do not want to get it confusedwith railroad retirement to which myamendment does not apply. That is ad-mitted, the fact that my amendmentcovers only private pension plans anddoes not affect railroad retirement at all.That is all I argue.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Theprecedent we establish would apply tothe Railroad Retirement Act.I have heretofore argued this position from thepoint of view of the Railroad RetirementAct, unsuccessfully, I might say, in thecommittee, but I know that when weopen this up we will be opening up Pan-dora's box, with a great many problemsinvolvingnumerousprivatepension plans.Mr. JAVITS. The Senator is stretch-ing the rubber band a long way when hesays it will be a precedent. I am confin-ing this amendment to private pensionplans. Private pension planners shouldnot have the benefit of this windfall.That is all I argue.Mr. COOK. Is it conceivable, if socialsecurity goes high enough, that an indi-vidual could pay into a private pensionplan for the entire years of his employ-ment and conceivably receive nothingout of it, if in fact this type of downwardescalation were to continue to prevail?Mr. JAVITS. Without any question,that is exactly what could happen; andthat is exactly what we are trying toforestall.Mr. President, I know that a rolicallvote could be had on this amendment,but I am sure of the good faith on thepart of the chairman and the confereesas to what will happen and so I am will-ing to have the amendment subjected toa voice vote.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, I yield backthe remainder of my time.Mr. JAVITS. I yield back the remain-der of my time.The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. PAcxw000).

Mr. President, I ask ursani-mom consent that time on the pendingamendment be limited to one-half hourto be equally divided between the authorof the amendment and the manager ofthe bill.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is thereobjection to the request of the Senatorfrom Louisiana? The Chair hears none,and it is so ordered.Mr. HARTKE. Mr. President, I risein support of H.R. 17550. I support whole-heartedly the many much-needed im-provements contained in this bill\u2014in particular, the $100 minimum benefit andthe provision calling for automatic in-creases In social security benefits as thecost of living goes up, The provision toadjust social security benefits automat-icallywill make certain that retiredworkers, disabled workers, and their de-pendents and survivors will never againbear the brunt of inflation. But adjust-ing benefits automatically to take accountof increases in the cost of living is smallcomfort tothe people dependent onsocial security if benefits are inadequateto start with. The provision in the billthat would increase benefit amounts for1971 by 10 percent is a step in the rightdirection\u2014but only a step. A 10-percentincrease is not enough. We must do more.We have an obligation to make bene-fit amounts provide true economic secu-rity for all beneficiaries.I,therefore, propose that we revisethe bill so as to increase social securitycash benefits, not by 10 percent, but by20 percent.The need to substantially raise the gen-eral level of social security benefits be-comes very clear to anyone who looks atthe benefit amounts that would be pro-vided under the committee billand considers the fact that most social secu-rity beneficiaries have very little in theway of continuing income other thantheir social security. For almost all bene-ficiaries,socialsecurityisthe mainsource of continuing income and forabout half the beneficiaries social secu-rity is virtually the only source of con-tinuing income.Monthly benefits for retired workersnow on the social security rolls who beganto draw benefits at age 65 other benefit improve-ments provided in the bill, the averagewould be $136\u2014$4.50 per day. With a 20-percent benefit increase alone\u2014taking noaccount of the other improvements\u2014theaverage monthly benefit for retired work-ers be raised to $141.60. With a 20-per-cent benefit increase, the benefit amountpayable to workers with average monthlyearnings of $650, the highest possible un-der present law, would be increased from$250.70 to $300.90. For a survivor familyconsisting of a widow and two or morechildren getting benefits on the basis of$650 of average monthly earnings, totalmonthly benefits of $526.60 would be pay-able instead of the $434.40 payable underpresent law.With the 10-percent increase and the$100 minimum recommended by thecommittee, 1.2 million aged beneficiarieswould be moved out of poverty. Withthe 20-percent increase and $100 mini-mum that I am recommending, thisnumber would increase to 1.6 million. Thus the increase in benefits provided bymy amendment will increase the num-ber of people lifted above the povertylevel of 400,000. Surely a 20-percent bene-fit increase is the least we can do.Frankly, we can do this, and the rec-ol'd shows that I at least am one Senatorwho pointed this out In 1967 when wemade such a gross error as to overchargethe people $500 million on an annuallevel sufficient to provide for a 15-per-.cent increase the next year without anadditional penny to pay for that.And we can do it without any addi-tional financing in the next several yearsbeyond what the bill now provides. Alltoo often in the past when the Congresshas made benefit improvements it hasalso increased the near-term social se-curity t.ax rates in order to finance thosebenefit improvements, In my judgmentit is preferable to Increase the tax rates10 or 15 years from now rather than toincrease the near-term rates. Becausethe near-term rates have been Increasedby congressional action, the assets of thesocial security cash benefit trust fundsnow amount to $38 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEDecember 28, 1970present law, the assets will increase bymore than $7 billion in 1972 and by morethan $12 billion in 1973. Even under thefinancing provided under the committeebill, the size of the funds would increasesubstantially in future years. I do not be-lieve that there should continue to be un-necessary, large-scale growth in the sizeof these funds. In fact, I consider it im-perative that we discontinue this prac-tice of building up large trust funds. Weare taking money from the working poorthrough a regressive tax that is not needed for benefit payments. This moneyis then loaned to the Federal G3vern-ment to finance its general operations atextremely low interest rates. The Gov-ernment should find other ways to meetits general expenses than to force thosewho can afford it the least to contributethrough a regressive social security taxto meet the cost of operating the Gov-ernment. Unlike an increase in the con-tribution and benefit base, which in-creases social security contributions onlyfor high earners, an increase in contri-bution rates- imposes 'an additional taxburden on the poor as well as on thosebetter off. The imposition of taxes whichserve only to increase the size of trustfunds is unfair and unjust and unnec-essary.I am pleased that the Committee onFinance has seen fit to use part of thetrust fund assets to pay the cost of thebenefit improvements the Committee hasrecommended. I think we can and shoulduse these assets to finance the additionalincrease I am recommending.If we are honest, we will admit that wedo not need all the money we have in thetrust funds now. The money In the trustfunds can be used to pay the cost in thenext few years of the additional benefitsI am recommending. Rising wages overthe years should bring enough moneyinto the social security system In lateryears to finance the cost of the additionalbenefits payable then.Of course, I am basing my convictionthat no additional financing Is neededfor a 20-percent-benefit increase insteadof a 10-percent increase on the assump-tion that wages will continue to rise inthe future as they have In the past. Ithink it is only realistic and reasonableto assume so. It Is my belief that we haveseriously burdened our citizens with highsocial security taxes In order to build uplarge trust funds simply because we haveused a level-wage assumption to figuresocial security costs expressed as a per-cent of payroll.If, however, my distinguished fellowcolleagues cannot be convinced to moveaway from this extremely conservativetradition, if they cannot be convincedthat it Is safe and sound to use a rising-wage assumption to figure social securitycosts, then general revenues should beused to finance the cost of the additionalincrease. I am strongly in favor of theidea of the Government's sharing In thecost of the social security program. Thisidea has been advanced many times be-fore. For example, it was advanced bythe Committee on Economic Security in1935, when the social security programwas being conceived. And It was againadvanced both by 1938 and 1948 AdvisoryCouncils on Social Security. A majorityof foreign social security programs haveprovisions for Government contributionsto their social insurance programs. TheUnited States has delayed too long infinancing Its social security program inways which reflect the social characteris-tics of the protection provided.The Congress has already provided forgeneral revenue financing of certain spe-cial aspects of the program. I am re-ferring to hospital Insurance for unin-sured people already over age 65 in theearly years of the program and to thespecial payments that the Congress hasprovided for people age 72 and over whoare not eligible for regular cash benefits.General revenue sharing of part of thecost of the social security program wouldmake an improved program possiblewithout increases in the social securitytax burden of those who can afford it theleast. The program would continue to becontributory, with benefits related toearnings and conditioned on a -specificperiod of past work under the system.Yet, with provision for a general revenuecontribution the cost of the programcould be more equitably distributed.I do not anticipate the need for a Gov-ernment contribution until further im-provements in the social security pro-gram are proposed in the future. But if itis the opinion of the Senate that addi-tional financing Is needed for my pro-posed benefit increase I strongly prefer ageneralrevenue contributiontoany other method of additional financing. Iam conceding on this matter of financingbecause I am so strongly convinced thata 10-percent increase in benefits is totallyinadequate. Because I am not willing tosacrifice a 20-percent increase on a fi-nancial point, I will modify my amend-ment to include provision for additionalfinancing from general revenues.If I can secure approval of my proposalfor a 20-percent increase in no other waythan to provide additional financing, andif we cannot agree to allocate generalrevenues for that purpose, then I suggestwe raise the contribution base t. $12,000.Mr. President, may I point out thatwhen the socialsecurity system wasoriginally enacted, the base was $3,000,which covered 90 percent of the work-ing force. To achieve the same percent-age today, the program would not befor a limitation of $9,000 or $12,000, but$17,000.As I have Indicated, raising the baseincreases social security contributionsonly for high earners and Is thus theLess regressive alternative. I am told thatadequate financing on the same basis wehave used in the past would be forth-coming with a $12,000 base and a com-bined employee-employer contributionrate for cash benefits of 9.2 percent for1971\u201474,11percent for1975\u201479. and12.5 percent for 1980 and thereafter.These rates are no higher than theywould be under present law until 1975.In conclusion, I want to repeat my con-viction that this is a good bill, and onethat deserves the support of all of us.With my amendment, however, It couldbe a truly significant bill\u2014one that wouldhave a substantial impact on the livesof 26 millIon Americans. I trust that wewill not fail our social security benefici-aries when they need our help.Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-sent to have printed in the RECORD lettersendorsing this proposal from the Ameri-can Association of Retired Persons, Na-tional Retired Teachers Association, theNational Farmers Union, and the Na-tional Council of Senior Citizens, Inc.There being no objection, the letterswere ordered to be printed in the RECORD,as follows:AMERICANAssociATIoNOFRE-TIRED PERSONS, NATIONAL RETIREDTE\\CHERS ASSOCIATION,Washington, D.C., Office SENATOR HARTKE: On behalf of themore than 2,500,000 members of the NationalRetired Teachers Association and the Amer-ican Association of Retired Persons I com-mend you for your efforts to provide a mean-ingful across-the-board Increase in Social Security benefits. Your Amendment to HR.17550 providing for a 20% increase in So-cial Security benefits effective January, 1971,recognizes the immediate financial needs ofover 20 million older Americans.While we welcome the action taken by theHouse of Representatives in tharea of So-cialSecurity reform, the 5% across-the-board increase authorized by the House is farfrom adequate.We were pleased to note that the SenateFinance Committee recommended In its re-port to the Senate that this benefit raise beincreased by an additional 5%, providing fora 10% overall increase in benefit levels. How-ever, this benefit Increase would not take ef-fect untii some months after January, 1971,and with our rapidly rising cost-of-livingeven the 10% raIse would be too little, toolate.This period of spiraling inflation, at anastounding rate of 6% to 7% annuafly, hasa greater and more profound effect on per-sons living on limited fixed incomes. It is ourolder and retired citizens who bear the larg-est share of the burden during such a periodof rapid inflation.The plain truth Is that nearly one-thirdof the more than 20 million AmerIcans 65years of age and older are now living at orbelowthepovertylevel. An even moreshocking fact Is that many of these peopledid not become poor until they became old.While possession of monetary resources doesnot necessarily guarantee happiness, the ab-sence of such resources can prevent people,at any age level, from leading a life of dig-nity. happiness and usefulness.We feel that fundamental to creating ameaningful life in old age Is Insuring suffi-cient economic resources to these millions ofolder retired workers who helped build thiscountry and make it great.Your Amendment to provide a 20% across-the-board increase in Social Security bene-fits, effective January, 1971, would do muchto prevent elderly persons from losing thisdesperate race with inflation and assure themthat their financial situation will, at least,remain relative to today's economy.Sincerely yours,CYRIL F. D.C.DEAR SENATOR HARTKE: I wish to expressour appreciation for your amendment to in-crease social security benefits by an addi-tional ten percent above the amount ap-proved by the Senate Finance Committee. December 28, 1970The National Farmers Union Is etrongly Infavor of increased payments under social se-curity, and we pledge our full support foryour efforts to achieve this through a Senatefloor amendment.Thanks again for your important initla-t I Va.Sincerely,Dr. WELDON BARTON,A.s'.stant Director of Legislative Services.NATIONAL OFSENIOR CITIZENS, INC.,Washington, D.C., 16, iluikling,U.S. Senate,Washington, D.C.DEAR SENATOR HARTKE: We are informedthat you are planning to introduce fromthe floor of the Senate an amendment toHR. 17550 (Social Security Amendments of1970) which would provide an additional tenpercent across-the-board increase in the cashbenefits of the Social Security program.We in the National Council of Senior Citi-zens are delighted that you are consideringsuch an amendment and we urge you to goforward with your plans. In my letter ofDecember 14 I cited again some of the well-known facts about the desperate plight ofthe great majority of elderly citizens In thiscountry who depend, for the most part, onSocial Security benefits for their livelihood.As I indicated then, the ten percent Increasein benefits contemplated Inthe Finance Committee bill would not anywhere nearlymeet the needs of these older people, nor,indeed, of the widows and other survivors infamilies whose breadwinners have died. Ob-viously the five percent increase\u2014withoutany additional increase in the minimumbenefit\u2014as provided In the House-passed bill,would fall even shorter as would any compro-mise between the two figures which mightemerge from conference if the Senate ap-proved Only the proposed ten percent in-crease.It Is our understanding also that you aredeveloping proposals for financing these In-creases in benefits that would maintain theactuarial integrity of the Social Security Sys-tem. We believe this is a responsible positionand we support you in these efforts. We Inthe National Council believe strongly thatthe most equitable method of financing suchImproved benefits is to make a substantialIncrease in the contribution and benefit base.Financing by this method avoids placing theadditional burden on the younger workersin the lower and middle-wage brackets andplaces it where It ought to be, on those re-ceiving higher Incomes\u2014in short, makes theSocial Security tax less regressive and moreprogressive. In this connection, it Is Inter- esting to recall that when the Social SecurityAct was first passed, the tax base of $3,000covered the entire wage income of about 96%of all the covered workers. To keep pace withthis standard, we would today have a con-tributionandbenefitbaseapproaching $17,000. In the light of the history of theSocial Security tax base therefore, the $9,000base contemplated both in the House-passedbill and the Senate Committee bill continueto lag far behind. Even a $12,000 limit on thetaxable wages or a $15,000 one are modestcompared to the coverage of wages underthe provisions of the original act.With all good wishes\u2014Sincerely yours,NELSON B. CRUIKSHANK,President,Mr. LONG. Mr. President, I yield my-self 2 minutes.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Louisiana is recognized for 2minutes.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, the com-mittee had the proposal before It. I be-CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATElieve the Senator outlined the cost. ItWould be about $3.3 million a year inexcess of the $5 billion in additional so-cial security benefits which the commit-tee voted.I really do not think that we canafford to go beyond this point. I believethat the tax which the Senate wouldhave to put on the help pay for thisextra benefit would be extremely un-l)opula r.I think that if the Senate were toagree to this amendment, the elderlypeople of the country would be in for abig disappointment when reading on oneday that the Senate voted for a 20-per-cent increase in social security benefitsand then reading 2 or 3 days later thatin conference the Senate conferees wereonly able to sustain an increase of 6 or 7percent, which is about where the costof living has gone, and perhaps a littlebeyond.Mr. President, we will have enoughdifficulty working out a bill with theHouse conferees the way it is now, sincethere has been some talk of the Houseconferees not even conferring with uson this matter. I believe it would makeit much more difficult to reach an agree-ment and, as a practical matter, I donot think it is possible to persuade theHouse to go along to afford the 10-per-cent increase we have already voted.I would submit at this time, along withthe many other things that have beendone in the bill to help the poor, that thecommittee has done about as much aswe could afford to do at this time. I donot think Senators would care to vote thelargetax increases inherent in this amendment.Does any Senator wish me to yield tohim?Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware, Mr. Pres-ident, will the Senator yield?Mr. LONG. I yield to the Senator fromDelaware.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. Pres-ident, I join the Senator from Louisianain expressing the hope the Senate rejectstheamendment, Thiscouldbethe amendment that would sink the ship.Congress raised social security bene-fits 15 percent about a year ago. TheHouse bill provided for a 5-percent in-crease, and this bill as reported by thecommittee carries a 10-percent increasewith a $100 minimum. If that amount isdoubled again we could end up with nobill at all.I hope the amendment is rejected.Mr. HARTKE. Mr. President, I yieldmyself an additional 2 minutes.I would like to point out that this sameargument was made in 1967. At thattime I thought we would accumulate $3billion. I was wrong. It has been $7 bil-lion. We will spend more money but evenif we did not change the base, by 1975we will accumulate $4,000,700,000 in thetrust fund, which will take us to a $30-billion surplus in the trust fund.If Senators have really been in thefield as I have been, talking to the poor people and understanding their prob-lems, they know that two million poor people are eligible for welfare and theydo not know how to apply for welfare,and they are not getting social security.S 21261If Senators wish to eliminate welfarethey should put It on a social securitybasis. This is about on4-fifth of the poorpeople of America.I agree with the Senator from Louisi-ana that if we are going to concede tothe House before we start to fight, Iimagine we will not do very well. If weput in the 20-percent increase we will bein a better position to hold something inconference than if we started at 10 percent.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Whoyields 'time?Mr. LONG.

Mr. President, I askunanimous consent that further read-ing of the amendment be dispensed with.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Withoutobjection, it is so ordered.The amendment is as follows:On page 418, between lines 19 and 20, In-Sert the following:(c) The Secretary shall pay to each Statewhich has a plan approved under title I, X,XIV,XVI,or XIX, or part A of title Iv, of theSocial Security Act, for each quarter begin-ning after March 1971, an amount equal tothe excess of\u2014(1) the total expenditures, under the Stateplan approved under such title or part, asaid or assistance with respect to Indians,Aleuts, Eskimos,. or other aboriginal persons,over(2)the amounts otherwise payable tosuch State under such title or part and undersection 9 of the Act of April 19, 1950 as theFederal share of such aid or assistance tosuch persons.Mr. METCALF. Mr. President, this amendment would provide full Federalpayments for welfare for all Indian peo-pie in all categories that under existinglaw are provided at 80 percent for theNavajo and Hopi in three categories. Theamendment was originally offered as S.2265, with 14 cosigners, then was revisedand introduced as amendment 1110 withthe cosponsorship Senators MANSFIELD,GOLDWATER, GRAVEL, HARRIS, MCCARTHY,MONDALE, Moss, STEVENS, YARBOROUGH,and ANDERSON.Our amendment would extend to allStates 100 percent Federal payments forexpenditures by the States under publicassistance programs for aid to all In-dians, Aleuts, Eskimos, or other aborig-inal persons. Existing law provides a spe-cial Federal payment of 80 percent forexpenditures by the States in behalf ofthe Navajo and Hopi receiving old age as-sistance, aid to dependent children, oraid to the needy blind. Our amendmentwould provide Federal payments forthese three categories and aid to the dis-abled and medicaid.In April 1950, the distinguished rank-ing member of the Senate Finance Com-mittee, Senator CLINTON ANDERSON, withSenators Hayden, O'Mahoney, Chavez,and McFarland succeeded in amendingthe Social Security Act to increase theFederal share of assistance to the Navajoand Hopi from 75 to 95 percent in somecases and from 60 percent to 92 percentin others.Mr. President, the American Indian isa Federal responsibility.In his major policy statement thissummer, President Nixon reminded usof this fact. He said:The special relationship between Indiansand the Federal government Is the resultof solemn obligations which have been en-tered Into by the United States govern-ment ... theIndians have often surrenderedclaims to vast tracts of land and have ac-cepted life on government reservations. Inexchange, the government has agreed to pro-vide community services such as health, edu-cation... serviceswhich would presumablyallow Indian communities to enjoy a stand-ard of living comparable to that of otherAmericans.The message went on to say:Because of the high rate of unemploy-ment and underemployment among Indians,thereisprobably no other group in thecountry that would be helped as directly andas substantially by programs such as thenew Family Assistance Plan and the pro-posed Family Health Insurance Plan. It Isestimated, for example, that more than halfof all Indian families would be eligible forFamily Assistance benefits and the enact-ment of this legislation Is therefore of criti-cal importance to the American Indian.Probably it is true that half of all In-dian families would be eligible for bene-fits, but my amendment, incorporatingmuch of the administration's Family As-sistance Act, repeals Public Law 474 ef-fective January 1,1972, and makes nosubstitute provision so that not even thespecial payments for the Navajo and theHopi will be made as before.It was estimated in 1966 that three-quarters of the Indian families living onreservations earn less than $3,000 an-nually, and while the off-reservation In-dian may earn higher wages because hedoes not receive the free medical careand other benefits that are available tothe reservation Indian, his real income isreduced accordingly. In States in whoseboundaries there are large tract,s of landset aside as reservations for Indian peo-ple, there is an overriding Federal re-sponsibility because the States derive norevenue from these lands.Deprived of that source of revenue, andrealizing precious little in income taxesfrom a people who earn too little to paythem, the State of Montana and otherswith large Indian populations are simplynot able to handle the burden of welfareassistance.The Montana Department of PublicWelfare has advised me that it is cost-ing $1.1 million in the biennium to pro-vide assistance to Indians in State-ap-proved plans for old age assistance, aidto dependent children, aid to the needyblind, and medicaid, as well as aid to thedisabled.Mr. President, I ask the Departmentof Health, Education, and Welfare toprepare a projection of the additionalFederal cost if our amendment were tobe adopted.Summarized, the additional cost to theFederal Government would be $45 mil-lion annually under existing law and $70million annually with enactment of thefamily assistance substitute.Mr. President, I have one final plea.There are many, many hopeful signson Indian reservations and among Indianpeople today. In Montanathere are sev-eraleconomic development programsthat are changing life on the reservationsfrom one of hopelessness and joblessnessto one of hope and industry and employ-ment and education.There aremotels, recreation com-plexes, et cetera. The Fort Peck Indians,for example, were successful in secur-ing a contract to repair rifles. The enter-prise has employed 120 people and hasbrought a payroll to the reservation thathas in turn brought pride and stability. Iam convinced that we are on the righttrack. I am convinced that the Senate,with approval of the Alaska Native claimsbill, has prepared the way for Alaska Na-tives to participate fully in the benefitsof economic development in that greatState. In Rough Rock, Ariz., a demon-stration school among the Navajo In-dians has achieved national recognition,I believe if we continued this momen-tum, the American Indian in a genera-tion could so significantly improve hiscondition that the cost of public assist-ance would drop sharply.In the meantime, public assistance isa vital support that will assure the suc-cess of the education and economic de-velopment programs which are bringingopportunity to the American Indian.Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-sent that several pertinent documents beprinted in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD atthe conclusion of my remarks. They in-clude a history of Public Law 474 pre-pared by the Honorable Wilbur J. Cohencost estimates of my amendment pre-pared by the Social and RehabilitationService of the National Center for SocialStatistics, a letter from the administra-tor of the Montana Department of Pub-lie Welfare and another from the claimsattorney for that department.nays 40, as 28, 1970There being no objection, the ma-terial was ordered to be printed in theRECORD, as follows:PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PRovIsIoNs FOR NAVAJOAND Hoes INDIANs: PUBLIC LAW 474(By Wilbur J. Cohen)On April Th,PresidentTruman approvedPublic Law 474, providing for the rehabilita-tion of Navajo and Hopi Indians. Section 9of this law provides for increasing the Fed-eral share of public assistance payments forneedy Indians of these tribes who reside onreservations or on allotted or trust lands andwho are recipients of old-age assistance, aidto dependent children, or aid to the blind.The new law becomes effective July 1, 1950.It provides that with respect to assistancepayments for these Indians the Federal Gov-ernment will pay, in addition to its regularshare under titles I, IV, and X of the SocialSecurity Act, 80 percent of the State's regu-lar share. The maximums for individual pay-ments specified in the Act apply to thesepayments.Thus, in a payment of $20 to a needy in-dividual, the regular State share is $5 andthe Federal share is $15. For Navajo and HopiIndians the Federal Government will pay $4additional (80 percent of the $5 State share)or a total of $19 out of the $20 payment. TheFederal share in such a payment would thusbe increased from 75 percent to 95 percent.In a $50 payment the Federal share wouldbe increased from $30 to $46, or from 60 per-cent to 90 percent.' The accompanying tableillustrates the effect of section 9 on publicassistance payments to Navajo and HopiIndians.LEGISLATIVE HISTORYThe first form (S. 1407) of the legislationthat became Public Law 474 was introducedon March 25, 1949, by Senatore O'Ma.honey,Hayden, Chavez, McFarland, and Anderson.Companion bills, H.R. 3476 and 3489,were introduced in the House of Representa-tives.2 S. 1407 passed the Senate on July 6,1949, with amendments, and passed theHouse with some further amendments onJuly 14, 1949. In the Conference Committee anew provision dealing with increased Fed-eral grants to the States for public assistanceto Navajo and Hopi Indians was Included insection 9. The Conference Report was ac-cepted in both the House and the Senate onOctober 3, and the bill was then sent to thePresident. The President vetoed the bill onOctober 17, 1949, but his veto message didnot contain any objection to the public as-sistance provisions of the bill.The Senate deleted the provisions of thebill to which the President objected andpassed a new bill, S. 2734, on October 18, theday after the veto was received. Immediateconsideration of the bill In the House onOctober 19 was objected to by RepresentativeKean, a member of the House Committee onWays and Means.With the adjournment of Congress, S. 2734went over the second session in 1950. TheHouse passed the bill on February 21, 1950,with several amendments, one ofwhich changed the method of determining theFederal share of public assistance paymentsto the two tribes. However, this amendmentwas based upon an erroneous interpretationof section 9 and in effect made the entirepublic assistance provision Inoperatlve. TheConferenceCommitteethereforedeleted certain language from the amended section9 and thus restored the section's effective-ness.7 The Conference Report was adoptedby the House on April 6, 1950, and by theSenate on April 10. The President signed thebill on April 19, 1950.The basic issue as to whether Indiansshould be given public assistance entirely atFederal expense or on the same basis as otherFootnotes at end of article.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEindividuals has been the subject of lengthydeba.te. When the House added the provisionto 5. 1407 to make all Indians within theNavajo and Hopi reservations subject to thelaws of the State in which they live, it be-came necessary to consider whether this sameprinciple should be applied to public assist-ance recipients or whether itshould be modified in some way. The following quota-tion from the Conference Committee Reportdescribes the difference of opinion betweenthe two houses:TheHouseconfereesinsistedupon section 9, but the Senate conferees wantedit eliminated for the reason that the exten-sion of State laws would obligate the Statesto make available the benefits of the Statesocial security laws to reservation Indians, anobligation which has not been assumed byNew Mexico and Arizona for two reasons:First, they have notadmitted their liability,claiming that under the enabling acts andFederal laws the Indian was an obligationof the Federal Government. Second, becauseof the large Indian population, the Statesstrenuously urged their financial inability tomeet this obligation.The Conference Report also explains thejustification for the '80-percent formula\":Less than 20 percent of the Navajo andHopi Indians speak the English language.The States have indicated their willingness toassume the burden of administering the so-cial security laws on the reservations withthis additional help. The Conference Com-mittee was of the opinion that this was afair arrangement particularly in view of thelarge area of tax-free land and the difficultyin the administration of the law to non-English-speaking people, sparsely settled inplaces where there are not adequate roadsand that it would be of particular advantageto the Indians themselves. This arrangementcan and no doubt will be changed as soon asthe Indians are rehabilitated. Both Statesassume full responsibility for nonreservationIndians at the present time.The percentage to be paid by the Statesunder this section, other than the cost ofadministration, is the same as was workedout In a conference at Sante Fe, New Mexico,between representatives of the Federal Se-curity Agency, Bureau of Indian Affairs, theoffices of the Attorney General of the Statesof Arizona and New Mexico, and the State De-partment of Welfare of the States of Arizonaand New Mexico, on April 28 and 29, 1949. Atthis conference, it was agreed that the netcost to the State would not exceed 10 percentof the total cost Incurred by the Federal andState Governments in aid to needy Indians(aged, blind, and dependent children). Thisis the agreement under which the' States arenow operating. However, it Is the opinion ofthe Conference Committee that the Indianswould be greatly benefited by the States' as-suming full responsibility for the adminis-tering of this law, and It would assure acontinued assistance which Would not bedependent upon appropriations through theBureau of Indian Affairs from year to year.Before the passage of the Social SecurityAct, the Federal Government assumed fullresponsibility for needy reservation Indians,and there is strong argument that the Fed-eral Government still has full responsibilityfor their care. The additional cost of theextension of social security benefits not here-tofore assumed by New Mexico and Arizonais only part of the cost of the extension ofState laws to the reservations. Therefore, theConference Committee is of the opinion thatthe amendment which was adopted Is a fairand equitable division of the expense.The 80-percent formula embodied in Pub-lic Law 474 is based upon a formula pro-posed in bills S. 691 and HR. 1921. Introducedin both houses on January 27, 1949, for allIndian \"wards\" in any State. Testimony wasgiven before the House Committee on Waysanct Means in favor of HR. 1921,10 but thec'i3IUt)Committee did not report that bill out nordid it include any special provision for Indi-ans in the social security bill, HR. 6000,reported out by the Committee.HISTORICAL BACKGROUNDOn several occasions Congress has givenconsideration to legislation affecting Indi-ans receiving public assistance under theSocial Socurity Act. In 1935 when the originalsocial security bill was being considered inthe Senate, a provision for payment by theFederal Government of the full cost of Indi-an pensions was passed by the Senate as areamendment to the pending bill. The proposedamendment provided for a new title in theSocial Security Act making payments to In-dians \"a pension from the United States inthe sum of $30 per month.\" 11 Thisamend- mnent was Sponsored by Senator Norbeck ofSouth Dakota. It was dropped, however, bythe Conference Committee and was not in-cluded in the final law.In a special report of the Social SecurityBoard on proposed changes in the SocialSecurity Act, which President Roosevelt sub-mitted to the Congress in January 1939, theBoard stated as follows:A number of States have a considerableIndian population, some of whom are stillwards of the Federal Government. The Boardbelieves that, with regard to certain Indiansfor whom the Federal Government is assum-ing responsibility in other respects, and whoare in need of old-age assistance, aid to theblind, or aid to dependent children the Fed-eral Government should pay the entire cost.If this provision Is made, the Board shouldbeauthorizedtonegotiatecooperative agreements with the proper State agenciesso that aid to these Indians may be given iiithe same manner as to other persons in theState, the only difference being In the amountof the Federal contribution. The Board be-lieves that it should also be given authorityto grant funds to the Office of Indian Affairsfor this purpose, if that appears more desir-able in certain circumstances.The House Committee on Ways and Means,however, did not include any provision con-cerning Indians in the 1939 social securitybill. The Senate Committee on Finance con-sidered an amendment affecting Indians butdid not report it out. On the floor of theSenate, an amendment was offered whichprovided that \"notwithstanding any otherprovisions of law, the Social Security Boardshall not disapprove any State plan undertitles I, IV and X of this act because suchplan does not apply to or include Indians.\" 10Thisamendment passed the Senate but wasdeleted by the Conference Committee andwas not included in the final 1939 law.The Social Security Administration hasconsistently Interpreted the Social SecurityAct to mean that a State public assistanceplan could not legally be approved if thatplan discriminated against any citizen of theUnited States on account of race. Twenty-four of the 26 States In which there areIndians residing on reservations provide pub-lic assistance under the Social Security Act tothese individuals. In Arizona and New Mex-ico, however, questions have been raised overthe years by both State agencies as to Wheth-er reservation Indians were to be included inthe public assistance programs under the So-cial Security Act.The immediate factors that led to the in-clusion of the public assistance provisions insection 9 of Public Law 474 first made them-selves felt on April 17, 1947. On that date theState Board of Public Welfare of New Mexicorefused the application of a Navajo Indianfor old-age assistance on the grounds thatreservation Indians were not a responsibilityof the State Welfare Department \"just aslong as they are under the complete juris-diction of the Indian service and insofar asthe ezpendlture of State money for their wel-fare Is concerned.\" At about the same time S 21264 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEDecember 28, 1970the Arizona State Department of PublicWelfare also took a position that it wouldriot make payments to reservation Indians.The Social Security Administration dis-cussed the subject with the State agenciesin an effort to resolve the conflict betweenthe position they had assumed and the re-quirement of the Social Security Act thatassistance must be available to all eligibleperson within the State. Discussions con-tinued over a period of time, and the Stateswere Informed that the continued receipt ofFederal funds for their public assistanceprograms was dependent on whether theState programs were operating in conformitywith the principle that applications are to beaccepted from all who apply and assistancegranted to all eligible persons. During thesame period the Bureau of Indian Affairsmade some payments, as their funds per-initted, to needy Indians in the two States.Finally, after all efforts to bring the Statesinto conformity with the requirements ofthe Social Security Act had failed, the Com-missioner for Social Security, after due no-tice,held hearings to determine whetherthere was a failure by New Mexico and Ari-zona to operate their plans in accordancewith sections 4, 404, and 1004 of the SocialSecurity Act. A hearing on New Mexico washeld on February 8, 1949, and on Arizona onFebruary 15, 1949. Before findings or deter-mination based upon these hearings weremade, the arrangements described in thequotations from the Conference Report onS.1407 were completed at Santa Fe, NewMexico, on April 28 and 29. 1949, and assist-ance was provided for reservation Indians inthese two States. It was the purpose of Pub-lic Law 474 to solve, by congressional action,the problems raised In the hearings beforethe Social Security Commissioner.\" As statedIn the Conference Report on the bill, theCommittee felt that efficient operation couldbe more definitely assured if the State wereto administer the entire program for needyIndians rather than share the responsibilitywith the Bureau of Indian Affairs.FOOTNOTESTechnlcal Adviser to the Commissionerfor Social Security.'The above figures and those in the tableare used only as general illustrations of theamount of Federal participation. They arebased on hypothetical Individual payments,Whereas actually, under the basic formulaof the Social Security Act, the Federal per-centages are not applied to individual pay-ments but rather to the average payments ofa State under each title. That part of anypayment for a month In excess of $50 to anaged or blind recipient and in excess of $27with respect to one dependent child in ahome and $18 with respect to each of theother dependent children in a home Is notcounted in computing the averages.For the history of legislative proposalsbefore 1949 see Hearings Be/ore a SenateSubcommittee of the Committee on Inter-ior and on S. 1407 (81st 3-7.

LEE METCALF,Senator from Montana, U.S. Senate, Washing-ton, D.C.DEAR SENATOR METCALF: Because of your in-terest in legislation relating to special federalmatching for assistance to Indians, I ambringing to your attention the fact that Sec-tion 401 of HR. 16311 (The Family AssistancePlan) would repeal Section 9 of the Act ofApril 1950 (25 U.S.C. 639) providing for spe-cial federsi matching for assistance to Nay-ajo-Hopi Indians.Your bill, 5. 2265, which you introduced onMay27.1969, would extend this specialmatching for all categories of federally-aidedassistance to all Indian tribes ill all states.The enactment of this legislation and theresulting additional federal funding wouldenable Montana to consider options and al-ternatives for program expansion that arenot now available because of the limitationof funds. I am sure there would be similarimpact in other states with substantial num-bers of Indians.In view of this, we would strongly urgethe inclusion of some form of special as-sistance for \"Indian\" states for the programsincluded under HR. 16311 as well as forTitle XIX of the Social Security Act. Fur-thermore, pending the implementation of theprovisions of HR. 16311 on July 1, 1971, theprovisions of your bill(S. 2265) should beenacted for the interim period and for per-manent effect if HR. 16311 fails of enact-ment.We greatly appreciate your efforts in be-half of the public welfare programs and thisdepartment. If there is any information youwill need from us. please let me know.With kindest personal regards, I am,Sincerely yours,THEODORE CARKUL.IS,Administrator.MAHAN-STROPE,Helena, Mont., January 15, 1969.Hon. LEE METCALF,U.S. Senator from Montana, Senate OfficeBuilding, Washington, D.C.DEAR SENATOR METCALF: The State Depart-ment of Public Welfare of the State of Mon-tana has caused to be introduced in theSenate and House of Representatives of theState of Montana during their current Legis-lation Session, a Joint Resolution urging thatthe President and Congress expand the aidnow given by the Federal Government to theNavajo and Hopi Indians, under Public Law474, 81st Congress (64 Stat. 47; 25 U.S.C.639).This legislation authorized eighty percent(80%) contrIbution by the Federal Govern-ment in addition to all other amounts pre-scribed, toward expenditures during the pre-ceding quarter by the State under the Stateplans approved by the Social Security Act forOld Age AssIstance, Aid to Dependent Chil-dren and Aid to the Needy Blind, to thesetwo Indian Tribes.The State Department believes that if thisaid was expanded to include the IndianThbes in Montana, and also expanded to notonly include the three Welfare categoriesabove mentioned, but all categories of We1-fare,including MedicalAssistance,there would be a saving of State funds of 1.1 mil-lion dollars for the two-year biennium.We feel that the Indians In Montana de-serve equal treatment with the Navajo andHopi Indians. We feel that they are some-what similarly situated in that Montana Isa sparsely settled state and subject to severeweather conditions and the Indians oftenfind themselevs under great hardships. IfCongress finds It Inadvisable to extend thisaid to all Indian Tribes then we would specif-ically ask that It be extended to those IndianTribes similarly situated to the Navajo and December 28, 1070Hopt Indians, such as the Rocky Boy Reser-vation Indians In Montana and the otherIndians on reservations In the Montana area.A,iy consideration you could give to changethe present law to extend this aid to theMontana Indianz and to increase It to Includeall categories of Welfare Assistance would besincerely appreciated.With kindest regards.Yours very truly,THOMAS H. MAHAN,Claims Attorney for the State Depart-inent of Public Welfare.Mr. MONDALE. Mr. President, will theSenator yield?Mr. METCALF. I am delighted toyield.Mr. MONDALE. I was privileged to joinwith the Senator from Montana in co-sponsoring this proposal.Is it not a fact that many of the samecounties In which Indian reservationsand large Indian populations are found,are very often, from a real estate stand-point of financing, burdened in the fi-nancing of the local share of these wel-fare cost,s? Thus, in addition to every-thing else, without full Federal supportfor the welfare cost.s, they are burdenedwithconstantlyrisinglocalwelfare charges consisting of local shares of thewelfare costs. I know that in the Stateof Minnesota In some cases these costshave risen to the point where there isliterally a destruction of the local realestate tax structure.Therefore, this amendment, if adopted,would go a long way toward relievingthem of what is an unfair and dispro-portionate imposition. Is that correct?Mr. METCALF. The Senator is correct.The fact Is that In many counties a sub-stantial amount of the land owned byIndians is in a trust status, and there-fore is not taxable either for State orcounty purposes.Second, if we adopt this amendment,we will have recognized that we have aFederal responsibility for the Indians,and, therefore, the State responsibilitywill be taken over.Some of the discrimination among In-dians\u2014and we have discrimination allover the Western United States\u2014will bealleviated. The second thing, of course, isthat we will have Indians who are on thereservation and have low Income, andhave no opportunities for employment,given a chance to have a substantial wel-fare payment.Mr. MONDALE. Would the Senatoryield further?Mr. METCALF. Certainly.Mr. MONDALE. Is It not the case thata few of the Indian reservations now en-joy the 100-percent feature?Mr. METCALF. The Navajos and theHopis.Mr. MONDALE. So that what the Sen-ator's amendment would do is simplyapply to all Indians similarly situatedthe same treatment?Mr. METCALF. All over America.Mr. MONDALE. I am proud to joinIn cosponsoring the amendment, and Ihope it will be adopted.Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, will theSenator yield?Mr. METCALF. I am glad to yield.Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, I am verypleased to be a cosponsor of the amend-ment now offered by the distinguishedCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014SENATESenator from Montana. He has done agreat service in suggesting this amend-ment. I think it gets at a problem which,as has been rightly pointed out, is a tre-mendous problem, and one which theSenate ought to meet. I hope the amend-ment will be adopted.Mr. RIBICOFF. Mr. President, will theSenator yield for a question?Mr. METCALF. I yield.Mr. RIBICOFF. I wonder if the Sen-ator could generally enlighten the Sen-ate as to how many beneficiaries wouldbe affected, as of now, if the Senator'samendment were adopted.Mr. METCALF. I have talked aboutIndians. The Interior Committee's defi-nition of an Indian is a person with one-fourth Indian blood. I do not know howmany Indians in that category there arein America. In Montana there are 27,000Indians In that category, but only about4,000 of those 27,000 are eligible to haverelief or welfare programs.Mr. RIBICOFF. I mean, does not theDepartment of the Interior or Health,Education, and Welfare know at thepresent time how many Indians arecovered? Because if the Federal Govern-ment picks up 80 percent of the cost,they must know what the numbers are.Mr. BYRD of West Virginia. Mr. Pres-ident, may we have order?The PRESrDING OFFICER. The Sen-ate will be in order, ,please.Mr. METCALF. The Federal Govern-ment picks up 80 percent of the cost ofwelfare for only the Navajos and theHopis. The Federal Government doesnot pick up any of the cost of welfarefor the Blackfeet, the Crows, the Papa-goes, the Sioux, and all those other In-dian tribes that are all over the West-ern United States.Mr. RIBICOFF. I mean, historically,does the Senator know why the FederalGovernment picked up the costs for twotribes, and not the others?Mr. METCALF. Because of the greatabilityofthe distinguished Senatorsfrom New Mexi\u00e4o, Mr. ANDERSON andMr. Chavez, who got this special treat-ment for Indians in their area.Mr. RIBICOFF. Those two Indiantribes are in New Mexico only?Mr. METCALF. That is right. But myamendment would not only provide that80 percent would be given, but would pro-vide that 100 percent of the contribu-tion be given to all Indian tribes allover the United States, the WesternUnited States.Mr. RIBICOFF. But the METCALF. What?Mr. RIBICOFF. notknow the pumber or the totalcost?Mr. METCALF. I do not know thenumber involved, and I have not beenable to ascertain the number from eitherthe Department of Health, Education,and Welfare or the Department of theInterior. But it Is a matter of commonjustice that every Indian on welfareshould have this contribution from Government.Mr. FANNIN. I think there are approx-imately 600,000 Indians in the UnitedStates. Is that not the figure?Mr. METCALF. But the 600,000 In-dians are not all on welfare.Mr. FANNIN. No; I understand. Butwhen we are talking about numbers, is itnot true that what we ar talking about,mostly, is the reservation Indians, as faras the Western United States is con-cerned?Mr. METCALF. That is what I amtalking about.Mr. FANNIN. So we really have moretribes than the Navajo and the Hopiinvolved, and more than the State of NewMexico, because a large part of theNavajo Reservation is in Arizona, as wellas the Hopi Reservation.Mr. METCALF. The Navajos and theHopis are already taken care of.Mr.FANNIN.Iunderstand;but among the Papagoes and all these othertribes, there are approximately 60 to 90reservations in the State of Arizona, de-pending on how you count reservations,and I ask the Senator how those reserva-tions are covered.Mr. METCALF. The only reservationscovered are the Navajo and the Hopireservations. They get payment of theirwelfare costs from the Federal Govern-ment. My amendment would provide thatall of the costs of welfare for all of theIndians in all of the reservations all overthe United States would be paid, 100 per-cent.Mr. RrBICOFF. If the Senator is cor-rect\u2014Mr. FANNIN. I was just trying to helpthe Senator understand.Mr. RIBICOFF. Yes. I appreciate thatvery much, because I think we have abasic problem. I appreciate what theSenator is trying to do, but I think weshould have the facts before us. How-ever, we do not have the facts. Betweenthe Interior Department and HEW, weought to have those figures. The Sen-ator's amendment, as I understand it,covers all Indians all over the UnitedStates, regardless of whether or not theyarc on reservations.Mr. METCALF. That iscorrect. If they are Indians and on welfare, they aregoing to be compensated 100 percent.Mr. RIBICOFF. So if an Indian livedin Washington, or in the State of Con-necticut, and could be so identified, thenthe cost to the State of Connecticut orthe District of Columbia, the entire cost,would be chargeable to the Federal Gov-ernment?Mr. METCALF. That is correct.Mr. RIBICOFF. I think it is unfortu-nate that we do not have the figures.I am very sympathetic with what theSenator is trying to do. I would hopethat if the amendment is adopted andgoes to conference, by the next timearound, between the departments, theycould enlighten the Senator as to thenumber of people involved.Mr. METCALF. I would be delighted ifthey could enlighten me. But it is a mat-ter of justice that an Indian who is onwelfare should be compensated by theFederal Government instead of by theState government. S 21266Mr.RIBICOFF. But if an Indian livesIn the State of Connecticut and receiveswelfare\u2014Mr. METCALF. And is on welfare.Mr. RIBICOFF. He would be receivingwelfare on the same basis as any otherresident of the State of Connecticut, andthe State of Connecticut would contrib-ute it.s 50 percent and the Federal Gov-ernment its 50 percent. What happens inthe State of Montana? Do not the Stateof Montana, the State of Arizona, theState of Washington, and the State ofUtah treat the Indians the same as theydo every other person who may be in-cligent and on welfare in their respectiveStates?Mr. METCALF. Except for the Navahosand th Hopis.Mr. FANNIN. If the Senator will yield,I rm very concerned about the welfareof the Indian and would like to clarifythe difference in these programs. Fromthe standpoint of the reservation Indian,we have a different program than wehave as far as the nonreservation Indianis concerned. The nonreservation IndianIs treated the same as any other citizen,whc-rcas the reservation Indian comesunder a different program, administeredby the BIA.It would be very difficult to administerthis program other than in the areaswhere they have the tribes. If we startsaying an Indian in Chicago or in NewYork or Illinois is entitled to such treat-ment, how do you make that determina-tion, or how do you find that Indian andgive him that treatment?Mr. METCALF. Many Indians, ofcourse, from Montana are in Chicago.Mr. FANNIN. Yes: I realize that. I amInterested in this proposal and wouldlike to find how it would work.Mr. METCALF. Because of the unfor-tunate relocation program that a formerSecretary of the Interior put into effect,we have reservation Indians from Mofl-tana and Arizona In Los Angeles who areon welfare. And, since we have a Federalresponsibility for Indians, why shouldthe State of California have to take careof those Indians that we have moved toLos Angeles, or the State of Illinois takecare of those Indians that we havemoved to Chicago, when we have a re-sponsibility to take care of these welfareIndians, on the reservation or off thereservation?I can remember a generation ago, In1937, when I was In the Legislature ofthe State of Montana, we had the In-dians coming down to us from so-calledHIll 57, asking for welfare. They askedfor appropriations and they asked forhelp. We failed to do that, and a wholegeneration has gone by. We have failedto take care of the welfare and we havefailed to provide opportunities for theseIndians. So we have the same problemover again, a generation later.This is what I am trying to do: 'I amtrying to say that the Federal Govern-ment should assume its responsibility forIts Indian wards, and that if they are onwelfare, wherever they are, we will paythe welfare.Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, willthe Senator yield?Mr. METCALF. I yield.Mr. MANSFIELD. May I say, In sup-port of the amendment offered by mydistinguished colleague, of which I am acosponsor, that when he used the word\"ward,\" I think he told the whole story.The Indians do occupy a peculiar posi-tion in American society. They are aminority group about which we haveforgotten a great deal, from whom wehave taken a great deal, who are thesubjects of dire poverty on their reserva-tions as well as in the large cities.I think that this is doing no more thanwhat is just for these people, from whomwe took this country, who have receivedso little consideration, and who shouldbe given a good deal more in the way ofcompensation than they have receivedup to this time. I think we can forget thesympathy and the figures and the num-bers and recognize a reality and face uptoit.Mr. RIBICOFF. There is no questionthat what the majority leader says istrue, that of all the minority groups, theIndians are lowest in the scale, whether Itis poverty, social, economic condition\u2014Mr. METCALF. Income.Mr. RIBICOFF. Lower than the hlack,,the Mexicans, the Spanish-speaking, anygroup in American society that we canname. Their poverty is the direst of alland deserves consideration. I am verysympathetic. I am going to support theSenator's amendment.I do not know what will happen to itin conference, but I would hope that thenext time we have a social security bill,between the Interior Department andHealth, Education, and Welfare, theywould supply some information so wecan address ourselves in a little moredepth and a little more understandingof the nature of this problem.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, will theSenator yield?Mr. METCALF. I yield.Mr. LONG. As the Senators havepointed out, a problem of discriminationis involved here, and I would be willingto agree to the amendment and seewhether we can work It out with theHouse in conference.The PRESIDING OFFICER.

It is one thatI had printed and ready to offer prior tothe submission of amendment No. 1150by Senator PERCY, which the Senateadopted by an overwhelming vote of 52to 9. Senator PERCY'S amendment pro-posed a work exemption of $2,400 priorto the loss of social security benefits. Myamendment No. 1128 proposes an exemp-tion of $2,500 prior to loss of benefits un-der thesocialsecuritypiovisions.Itmeans that a person could earn $8.33 \u00bdmore per month before losing social sec-urity benefits than he would under theamendment offered by Senator PERCY.I am sure that in view of the over-whelming vote of 52 to 9 that occurred onthe Percy amendment\u2014The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chairinterrupts the Senator to state that theamendment is not in order.Mr. CANNON. The amendment is notin order?The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is notin order. That part of the bill alreadyhas been amended.Mr. CANNON. I was going to withdrawit, anyway, in view of the fact that theamendment had been adopted. But I didwant to comment on it, because I amsorry that the time limitation on theprevious amendment had not been usedup, and this amendment therefore oc-curred at an earlier time than was in-tended. Otherwise, I would have pro-posed mine as a substitute.However, I am sure that the Senatewould not want to begrudge the recipi-ents of social security the opportunityto earn another $100 per year before los-ing their social security benefits. I regretthat it is not possible to give them theopportunity to earn $2,500 per year be-fore losing the social security benefits,in view of the high cost of living and theincreasing cost, due to the Inflation thathas been taking place in this countryduring the past 2 years.Mr. COOK.

Mr. President, this amendment would prohibit the Statesfrom reducing the amount of welfarepayments to recipients by the amountof increase those recipients would re-ceive as a result of the passage of thesocial security amendment,s to increasethe benefits.In the proposed act, as it now reads,is an exemption to the extent of $10 amonth. However, a number of recipientswould receive more than an increase of$10 a month under the social securityamendments. I think it is Indeed unf or-tunate that States In the past, in manyinstances, when Congress has enacteda social security increase, have reducedthe amount of the welfare paymentsfrom the State by the amount that waspassed as an increase under the SocialSecurity Act.Plainly and simply, this amendmentwould prohibit the States from makinga corresponding reduction in the amountof welfare payments to the social se-curity recipients as a result of the in-creases in the act.I urge my colleagues to support thisamendment.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amend-ment.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, when weraise social security benefits, we corre-spondingly reduce the need of individ-ualsforwelfareassistance.Down through the years, some of us\u2014I havebeen one offering amendments from timeto time\u2014have offered amendments to re-quire that the States not reduce welfarepayments when social security paymentsare increased. One thing we do hope toachieve over a period of time is, by rais-ing the minimum payments under socialsecurity and by increasing social securitybenefits, that gradually we will reducethe number of people drawing public as-sistance. Over a period of time we hopethat the relatively small number of ouraged who are now required to seek pub-lic assistance will be further reduced, be-cause our social security program is in-tended ultimately to eliminate that need.The committee bill we have here hasniore or less split the difference. TheStates would have some saving againsttheir welfare budgets in the adult cate-gories. But at the same time, they wouldbe required to pass along, in terms ofwelfare benefits, the lalge portion of thatwhich has been voted by the committeefor social security increases. So if a per-son receives a social security increase, letus say, of $15 or $20, he would be able tokeep most of it, although there may besome reduction in his welfare payments.The Senator would try to see thatthere would be no reduction in the wel-fare payments. If we are going to dothat,it would result in the situationthat, by raising social security payments,we would never be taking people off thewelfare rolls. They would just stay therereceiving the same amount of welfare,no matter how much we raised socialsecurity payments.In that regard, I think the amend-ment would create an even greater prob-lem, because we would be committed inthe future to the proposition that whenwe voted social security Increases thewelfare payments people were receivingwould not be reduced.To do so would mean that even if wewould provide enough social securitybenefits so that recipients really did notneed welfare any further, we would stillbe paying it.I think the Senator's amendment goestoo far. The committee has gone aboutas far as it could towards achieving theobjective the Senator has in mind and,therefore, I would hope that the amend-ment would not be agreed to.However, I applaud the Senator forhis interest in these people.Mr. CANNON. Mr. President, I be-lieve that the increases in social securitybenefits being proposed by the Senateare not intended to take people off wel-fare. They are intended to help get peo-ple in a position to maintain a standardof living that they cannot maintain to-day under the present social securitybenefits. It is indeed, unfortunate thatmany people on welfare are those whoare drawing a minimum of the amountof social security benefits who, unfor-tunately, in the past, have received somesmall increases and, in turn, have hadthat taken away by the States.In this case, here we are providingsome increases to those people. I thinkthat they are entitled to those increases,even though they may be entitled to asubs1stence amount from the welfaresystem of the State. because of the In-adequate amount they are now receivingto maintain a standard of living andthat, therefore, these people should notbe penalized simply because they aredrawing welfare compared to other peo-ple who are drawing social security.I hope that the Senate will supportthe amendment. I an prepared to vote.The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. HARTKEL The question is on agreeing tothe amendment of the Senator fromNevada.The amendment was rejected.AMENDMENT NO. 1129Mr. CANNON.

Mr. President, earlier inthe year, when Congress adopted a corn-prehensive Airport and Airways Act,there was a provision for the licensingof aircraft which provided that therewould be a registration fee of $25 peaircraft, on general aviation type air-craft, on aircraft weighing 2,500 poundsor less, and on aircraft over and abovethat weight there would be a poundagefee applied of 2 cents per pound.Congress passed the act, and in imple-menting the provisions of the act it de-veloped that a person who had an air-cl'aft, for example, that weighed 2,600pounds, would pay the initial $25 regis-istrationfee and then would pay thepoundage fee on the entire 2,600 pounds,not on the excess poundage over andabove 2,500 pounds weight.All this made a very inequitable situa-tion to the many general aviation air-craft owners throughout the country whoare, indeed, having a difficult time ofit today, because of the increases thatwere added in the aviation fuel tax topay for the airport and airways bill. Sothat we hit them with the added fueltax on the one hand and the registrationfee on the other. But, in addition, wedoubled the application of the registra-tion fee for those general aviation air-craft owners who had aircraft thatweighed more than 2,500 pounds.I submit that this is clearly an in-equitable situation, that it was not theintent of Congress at the time-it wascertainly not my intent at the time andI served on the committee that helpedto draft the bill, and I served on the con-ference committee, It certainly was not S 21268 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEDecember 28, 1970my Intention that these aircraft ownersbe taxed twice on the weight of theiraircraft.Therefore, the amendment I have pro-posed here would say that a man wouldpay a $25 registration fee on an aircraftweighing less than 2500 pounds, andwould pay the poundage on the aircraftweight only on the weight in excess of2,500 pounds, and would not be payingtwice on that weight from zero up to2,500 pounds.I hope that the Senate will help to cor-rect this inequity.Mr. RANDOLPH. Mr. President, willmy colleague from Nevada yield?Mr. CANNON. I yield.Mr. RANDOLPH. The category of air-craft operations for which the able Sena-tor speaks is, of course, general aviation.In these days general aviation is not anoperation using the single-engined air-craft of 20 years ago. General aviationnow includes many sophisticated twin-engine planes. These newer aircraft havebrought increased safety and greatercomfort for passengers who are flying. ItIs necessary, I believe, to promote andsupport air taxi in the United States\u2014services which connect with local car-riers and trunk lines throughout thecountry. These operators, persons oftenwith little financial strength, are givingreal service to the mobility of the Ameri-can people. They need the aid which Isproposed in the amendment offered bythe Senator from Nevada.I remember very well working with himat the time we were active in the Federalairports and airways bill in reference to abetter break for general aviation in thetaxes he pays. If agreeable with him, Iwould like to ask that he include me asa cosponsor of his amendment.Mr. CANNON. I am delighted to havethe Senator's support as a cosponsor ofmy amendment.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, would theSenator from Nevada yield?Mr. CANNON. I yield.Mr. LONG. We do not have any otherrevenue provisions on this bill that arenot related to the problems of the agedor to medicare and I would, therefore,hope that the Senator might offer hisamendment on some other revenue meas-ure. For example, we have this excisetax bill which will have to be passed be-fore we are through.We have a number of other measuresthat have been brought to us In the lastday or so. I have no strong objectionto the Senator's amendment. However, Ihope that he would not open the doorto amendments that are completely non-germane to social security, public wel-fare, and retirement Income, because todo that opens the door to Senators goingto the desk and picking up bills thatcome over here by the dozens these daysfrom the House. They ought to be at leastconsidered and have the benefit of acommittee recommendation.I would hope that the Senator wouldbe willing to offer the amendment onsome other measure, such as the excisetax bill or some other bill that we willhave an occasion to consider betweennow and the time we adjourn.I am sure that the Senator knowsthe amendment is not germane to thebill. We managed, by a motion to recom-mit, to limit ourselves to the subjectmatter we are working on in the bill.Mr. CANNON. Mr. President, If I with-draw the amendment and offer this tothe excise tax bill, would I receive thesupport of the Senator from Louisiana?Mr. LONG. Mr. President, I would co-operate with the Senator if he were tooffer it to another bill so that we couldthen go with that to the House.Mr. CANNON. Mr. President, based onthat assurance, I propose to withdraw theamendment, because I for one do notwant to see the social security bill getloaded down with a lot of nongermaneitems that might conceivably delay itspassage. That is one of the reasons thatI voted earlier to recommit the bill andhave it reported back without some ofthe other provisions in It.Mr. President, based on the state-ment of the Senator from Louisiana, Iwithdraw my amendment No. 1129, andI will offer It at the appropriate time.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment Is withdrawn.The bill is open to further amendment.AMENDMEN'r NO. 1140Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I call upamendment No. 1140.The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mi'. President, what thisamendment does is to provide for clergy-men the right either to be consideredself-employed or to be considered as em-ployed by a church or vestry in whichcase, they would be required to con-tribute a smaller amount than if theywere self-employed, but that amountwould be matched by the employer.This would mean that the clergymenwould not be faced with the problemthey are faced with today where they donot receive the same benefits at the endof their service as they would if they hadbeen considered as normal employees.The amendment is not mandatory inforce, but is optional. I think that ingeneral it justifies some support.I am very conscious of the fact thatthe chairman has pointed out to me thatthis was not introduced in time to securehearings. I would hope that if I do with-draw the amendment now that he wouldbe kind enough to let me have a hearingat the first opportunity.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, the prob-lem of socialsecurity protection forclergymen has been very difficult to dealwith because of the different problemsfacingdifferentreligiousgroups. Wetried to work out the best compromisebetween the various religious groups wecould in previous legilation. We thoughtthat we had, to about the greatest extentpracticable, resolved these conflicts anddifferent points of view consistent withthe actuarial problems presented by theadministration. It would seem to me thatit would be appropriate to raise this mat-ter next year in connection with the so-cial security bill that the House intendsto send to us.I hope that the Senator will raise thequestion at that time and that we couldhave hearings so that those who mightoppose the amendment could be heard aswell as those who favor it.I do welcome the opportunity to lookat the matter and see if we can work itout in a fashion that would be agreeableto all.Mr. FELL.

Mr. President, I co-sponsor the amendment of the able Sen-ator from Oklahoma (Mr. HARRIS).Earlier this year I Introduced legisla-tion\u2014S. 1781\u2014to amend title II of theSocial Security Act to eliminate com-pletely the reduction of disability insur-ance benefits. Under present law, the\"offset\" reduction is required for an indi-vidual who qualifies for both workmen'scompensation and social security bene-fits. The disabled worker and familybreadwinner finds that the social secu-rity benefits payable to him and his fam-ily are reduced by the amount, if any,that the total monthly benefits payableunder the two programs exceed 80 per-cent of his average current earnings be-fore he was disabled. This provision hascreated injustice among those severalthousand disabled workers who knowthat the social security insurance theyhave contributed to over the years hasbeen cut, because of receipt of workmen'scompensation benefits to which they areentitled. There are innumerable individ-ual hardships created by this arbitrarylaw.Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-sent to have printed at this point in theS 21269 RECORDa memorandum which I wasprivileged to present to the chairman ofthe Senate Finance Committee and themembers of that committee in connec-tion with my prior legislative effort toamend title II of the Social Security Act.There being no objection, the memo-randum was ordered to be printed in theRECORD,asfollows:MEMORASIDUMTo: Members of the Senate Finance Com-mit.tee.From: Senator Randolph.Subject: S. 1781, \"a bill to amend title IIof the Social Security Act to eliminatethe reduction in dlsabiilty insurancebenefits which is presently required inthe case of an Individual receiving work-men's compensation benefits.S. 1781 would amend Title II of the SocialSecurity Act by repealing Section 224 whichprovides for reduction in disability insurancebenefits in the case of an Individual who isreceiving workmen's compensation.Under present law, when a disabled workerunder age 62 qualifies for both workmen'scompensation periodic payments and socialsecurity disability benefits, thesocial secu- rity benefits payable to him and his familyare reduced. The reduction Iscalculated on the basis that total payments under the twosystems cannot exceed 80 percent of his \"average current earnings\" before he becamedisabled.The net result Is that the combined bene-fits equaling 80 percent of a disabled worker'saverage earnings are usually less than 80 per-cent of his level of earnings achieved at thetime of disablement (average about 72 per-cent) even though his normal expenses con-tinue at the pre-disablement level in addi-tion to expenses caused by his disability notcovered by workmen's compensation. Theunfairness of this provision is further com-pounded by its application Only to those per-sons who become eligible for disability In-surance benefits after December 31, 1969. Itdoes not apply to those who were alreadyreceiving these benefits.An example: Father of four, age 35, dis-abled on the job in 1967, received a lumpsum compensation award of $8,700. He paidoffdebts, made down payment on smallhome. His claim forsocialsecuritydis- ability Insurance benefits was denied, buttwo years later on appeal, denial was reversedby district court. His social security pay-mentsweredrasticallyreducedbecause workmen's compensation was pro-rated overfive-year period at $151.60 a month. Thus,the disabled father's earned social securitypayments were cut from $262.50 a month to$110.80 a month\u2014even though he alreadyhad spent the workmen's compensation awardfor debts, house payment and living expensesover prior two years before court decision.As a result, the father who previously hadearned $328 monthly average before dis-ablement had to apply for public welfare,Another example: An unskilled worker inthe oil Industry suffered a work-related ac-cIdent in 1966. The worker (father of threeminor children) was totally disabled andworkmen's compensation pays him $35 aweek. Over the years, his earnings had varied,but had reached a monthly average of $291in 1965. After application of the offset pro-visions, his monthly social security benefits($106) were totally withheld. His monthlyincome of $151.60 (from workmen's com-pensation) amounts to 52 percent of hismonthly earnings during the year prior tohis disabling injury.Approximately 18.900 disabled worker bene-ficiaries (about 1 percent of the 1.4 millIondisabled workers on social security rolls)were affected by the reduction provision (Sec.224) which was added to the Social SecurityCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATE S 21270Amendments of 1965. At that time, the Sen-ate Committee on Finance report stated: \"Itis desirable as a matter of sound principleto prevent the payment of excessive com-bined benefits.\"Although moSt persons generally wouldagree with that statement, its application todisabled persons and families creates severehardship and burdens. There are many In-justices and inequities in our system oflaws. Very often legislative action favors cer-tain classes of persons or areas. But it is mybelief that full payment of combined bene-fits to the disabled workers and their fami-lies would not be challenged on this basis.Particularly important justification for re-pealing Sec. 224 is the concept of the pro-grams involved\u2014workmen's compensation isprivate insurance, while social security iscompulsory public insurance.The Social Security Administration statesthat the total number of disabled benefici-aries (workers and dependents) whose bene-fitswere withheld or reduced was about61,lOO\u2014out of a total of 2.5 million on therolls. That is 2.5 percent of the totai of socialsecurity beneficiaries. The higher proportionof disabled beneficiaries affected results froma requirement of the law that any necessaryreduction be appliedfirstto dependents' benefits.S. 1781 would eliiinate the economic -in-equities created by Sec. 224 by allowing fullpayment of combined benefits to a disabledworker and his family. If the change is en-acted, 55,000 beneficiaries would have theirsocial security benefits increased and 5,000persons who presently receive no benefitswould receive some benefits at once.It is my genuine hope that S. 1781 willbe includedintheSocialSecurityAct Amendments of 1970.Mr. RANDOLPH. Mr. President, wehave heard testmiony in various com-mittees\u2014for example, the Subcommitteeon Labor of the Committee on Labor andPublic Welfare\u2014that seldom do disabledworkers receive the full benefit of com-pensation awards. In Charleston, W. Va.,recently, the Subcommittee on Laborheard witnesses testify that, althoughcompensation cases nominally do not re-quire the services of an attorney, in ac-tual practices those appealing such casesmust share their compensation awardswith lawyers.Under the social security offset pro-vision, a worker's average current earn-ings for the purpose of establishing bene-fits are computed on the basis of: First,the average monthly earnings used forcomputing his social security benefits, orsecond, his average monthly earnings inemployment or self-employment coveredby social security during the 5 consecu-tive years of highest covered earningsafter 1950, computed without regard tothe limitations which specify a maximumamount of earnings creditable and tax-able under social security.Mr. President, the objective of theseprovisions is to avoid the payment ofcombined amounts of social security ben-efits and workmen's compensation pay-ments that would be excessive in com-parison to the beneficiary's earnings be-fore he became disabled.I point out that the matter of a sum ofmoney is not the total consideration here.The man who has an injured spine or theman who has twisted limbs for all in-tents and purposes is totally disabled. Itshould not be necessary for me to impressupon Senators t'he financial hardship toa worker and his family when the work-CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEer's combined social security disabilitybenefits and workmen's compensationpayments amount to less than he earnedat the time he became disabled.We must recognize,however, thatworkmen's compensation is not solely areplacement of lost earnings but is, inpart, compensation for pain and loss offunction for which the disabled workermightotherwisesecurerecompensethrough legal action against his employ-ers. The present provisions are undulyrestrictive and result in severe hardshipsfor disabled workers and their families,A worker's total disability will usuallygive rise to substantial expenses in addi-tion to the family's continuing regularexpenses, particularly in health care andmedical expenses. Limiting the combinedbenefits that are payable to 80 percentof the average current earnings has inmany instances caused a significant re-duction in the family's living standard.The family's long-term commitments,such as mortgages and time purchases,cannot be reduced accordingly, and insome cases, long-time plans for collegeeducations for children evaporate.A worker's average current earningsare calculated for purposes of the exist-ing provision on the basis of his earningsover a protracted period, rather than hisearnings just before disablement. Thereare documented cases in which a workerreceived substantial increases in wagesor earnings in the year prior to his dis-ability, and accordingly mcreased hisstandard of living. Families often suffera sharp drop in income upon disablementof the breadwinner which is significantlybelow 80 percent of the worker's latestearnings.To correct these inequities, the Housecommittee decided that the allowableamount of combined workmen's com-pensation and social security disabilitybenefits should be increased. The Houseamendment would raise the combinedpayments allowable to 100 percent ofthe worker's average current earnings.This provision was deleted by the Sen-ate Finance Committee in its considera-tion of the social security bill because,as I stated, members of the committeefelt the combined benefits to which thedisabled worker is justly entitled mightbe an excessive reward for his disable-ment, or might somehow discourage himfrom entering a rehabilitation program.Mr. President, I believe there is no cer-tain sum of money that can adequatelycompensate for a broken spine, twistedor missing limbs. I believe that no work-ingman who is a productive member ofour society would trade places with hisdisabled brother who, along with hisfamily, must face the future with some-thing less than pride of achievement andpromising outlook.The human spirit, I submit, can be assorely wounded as the human body.Istrongly support our amendmentwhich would provide that, in a case inwhich workmen's compensation is pay-able, social security disability benefitswill be reduced only by. the amount bywhich the combined payments exceed100 percent of the worker's averageearnings before he became disabled. Iremind Senators\u2014and I emphasize thispoint\u2014that such a formula will not nec-December 28, 1970essarily bring a worker up to his level ofearnings just prior to disability. I urgethe Members of the Senate to join inassuring that disabled workers receivefair and equitable treatment under thelaws governing disability payments.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Whoyields time?Mr. LONG. Mr. President, I yield my-self 5 minutes.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Louisiana is recognized.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, in this billwe have liberalized the definition of dis-ability for welfare purposes to providethat the person is regarded as disabledif he is unable to work at gainful em- ployment for one year because of illnessor disability. In the years when we firststarted working on disability, I was one of those Senators seeking to provide as- sistance to disabled persons. I joined as a cosponsor in the amendment to insurepeople under social security for disabil-ity. But we have two kinds of situationsthat develop. We have situations wherepeople are disabled for 1 year or a year and a half and after a while they over- come that disability and they are ableto go to work, and we hope they do go to work.If they are to receive as much money in social security plus workmen's com- pensation as they would receive if theywent to work, where is the incentive togo to work? They would lose those bene-fits if they went back to work, so the in-centive would be not to go to work.The Senator pointed to a situationwhere the person is truly totally dis-abled. Let us assume the person had a back injury and is never able to workagain. It can well be argued in that casewe should let him have 100 percent ofwhat he would make if he went to work.That would be a reasonable compromisebetween the Senate provision and theHouseprovisionbecausetheHouse would do that which the Senator seeksand say the person can have 100 percentin social security and disability of whathe earned prior to being disabled.However, if the Senator's amendmentprevails, we could have only the Houseposition in conference, and even thougha person would have a disability thatlasted only a year or a year and a fewmonths, the incentive would be not to goto work because that person would getas much money by not working as hewould for working. In that case it wouldmake good logic, as in the Senate provi-sion, and as the committee sought to do,that he get only 80 percent as much insocial security and disability insuranceand In disability benefits under work-men's compensation as 80 percent ofwhat his pay would be, hoping that theother 20-percent advantage would enticehim to go to work.Mr. CURTIS. Mr. President, will theSenator yield?Mr. LONG. I yield.Mr. CURTIS. Will the distinguishedchairman tell me what the tax conse-quences are of disability benefits andworkmen's compensation?Mr. LONG. It Is tax exempt; so as apractical matter, this amendment wouldmean, when taxes are taken into consid-eration,the person who Isdisabled December 28, 1970would actually be better off in terms ofmoney if we take the 100 percent amend-ment because he would pay no taxes onhissocialsecuritydisabilitybenefits while his earnings would be taxed if hewent to work.Mr. CURTIS. What would be the situ-ation with reference to expenses of em-ployment, the expenses of going to andfrom employment, lunch away fromhome, and that sort of thing? Thosewould be expenses that would fall onthe individual who was employed, wouldthey not?Mr. LONG. Well, presumab1y, it costshim money to go to work. Those areexpenses a man would incur going towork so that would come out of hiswages. I had not made that argument,but if that were taken into considera-tion, he would be worse off if he goesback to work.If one were to take taxes into con-sideration and expenses in going to work,a person would be better off to continueto draw socialsecuritybenefits andworkmen's compensation benefits thanto go to work, so if there is to be anyincentive to get him back to work, theSenate will have to do at least part ofwhat the Committee on Finance did, intrying to place the emphasis on work,hoping the person would go to work andmake more and improve his ability todo a better job rather than draw the so-cial security and disability insurance, anddecline to go to work.Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, I yieldmyself 5 minutes.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Oklahoma is recognized for 5minutes.Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, I thinkthe colloquy we just heard between theSenator from Nebraska and the Sena-tor from Louisiana, with all due re-spect, does not take Into account the realsituation of the man who receives bene-fits because he Is totally disabled and isreceiving what he paid for. That Is theInsurance he paid for. This is not somewelfare program we are giving him out ofthe goodness of our hearts. He paid forthat and he is entitled to it.Furthermore, it leaves out the con-sideration that a man who has been in-jured on the job and has been adjudi-cated to be entitled to workmen's com-pensation because of the fact he hasbeen Injured Is not better off if he getsthe same amount of money. That argu-ment does not take into account that theman has been injured. He had pain andsuffering in addition to the loss of hiswages. Therefore, it is not correct to sayjust because he gets what is coming tohim, and what he has paid for under theSocial Security System, and just be-cause he is receiving what he is entitledto under the law\u2014workmen's compensa-tion, not only for loss of wages but painand suffering\u2014that he should be heldto 80 percent of what he made before.That does not make him whole. He isentitled to 100 percent and that Is whatthe House said In their bill.Mr. President, this amendment wouldrestore the House-passed provision re-lating to the reduction of social securitybenefits when workmen's compensationis also payable.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEUnder present law, social security ben-efits are required to be reduced whenworkmen's compensation is also payableand when the combined payments ex-ceed 80 percent of average current earn-ings before disablement.The House amended this provision.The House bill called for a reduction inbenefits by the amount by which thecombined payments under both programsexceed 100 percent of average currentearnings before disability.This amendment applies to only about60,000 persons and would cost only about$7 million annually.I believe a strong case can be madeto restore the House language.A convincing argument for the Houseprovision is made in the report of theCommittee on Ways and Means, whereinit is stated:Workmen's compensation is not solely areplacement of lost earnings but is, in part,compensation for pain and loss of functionfor which the disabled worker might other-wise secure recompense through legal actionagainst his employer. It should, therefore,not be necessary to limit a worker's com-bined social security disability benefits andworkmen's compensation payments to lessthan he earned before becoming disabled.Limiting the combined benefits that are pay-able to 80 percent of average current earn-ings has in many instances caused a sig-nificant reduction in the family's standardof living In comparison with the level at-tained by the worker at the time of dis-ablement.The argument is sometimes made thatraising the ceiling for combined work-men's compensation and social securitydisability benefits to 100 percent of theworker's average earnings\u2014during the5 years of highest earnings\u2014may in somecases result in combined benefits thatare larger than the worker's earningsbefore his disablement.However, we know that as a rule aworker's wage increases year by year,and over a 5-year period the earnings atthe end of the 5-year period are al-most always higher than the average forthe 5 years.The argument is also made that sincecurrent earnings of a worker are taxable,and social security benefits and work-men's compensation benefits are not,that a 100-percent ceiling on combinedbenefits could exceed the worker's pre-disability take-home pay and therebyreduce the incentive of the worker toattempt to become rehabilitated forgainful employment.There is no merit in this argument.Most of the workers affected by thisamendment are workers in the lower In-come brackets and the taxes involved arerelatively small. But, more Importantly,a disabled worker's motivation for vo-cational rehabilitation isstrong andwould not be influenced by a smallamjunt of additional money that mightbe received by a worker by reason of nothaving to pay taxes.As a matter of basic fairness, a dis-abled worker should be entitled to 100percent of average earnings before socialsecurity benefits to such worker also re-ceiving workmen's compensation wouldbe reduced.I yIeld 1 minute to the Senator fromWest Virginia.S 21271Mr. RANDOLPH. For the purpose ofa question.Mr. HARRIS. I yield.Mr. RANDOLPH. It is correct that theworker has been injured and that is whyhe receives workmen'. compensation. Isthat correct?Mr. HARRIS. The Senator is abso-lutely correct.Mr. RANDOLPH. He was not on wel-fare. He was not a drag upon society.He was the breadwinner. He was the headof the family, and the injury which cameto him in discharge of his honest laborbrought to him a total disability whichmakes it impossible for him to return tohis employment. Is that not correct?Mr. HARRIS. That is absolutely cor-rect.Mr. RANDOLPH. Certainly in thisamendment we are not seeking to bringan incentive to loaf. Rather, we are ask-ing only equity for a worker who becamedisabled while engaged In gainful em-ployment.As some Senators have stated, the com-bined payments for a limited numberof workers will exceed the amount ofmoney such workers were earning at thetime of disability. But in most situationsthis will not be true because of the aver-age earnings formula.Mr. HARRIS. The Senator Is quitecorrect, and I say, in closing, I am verygrateful that the distinguished Senatorfrom West Virginia brought this matterso forcefully to the attention of the Sen-ate Finance Committee. I am pleased tojoin with him now in bringing it to theattention of the Senate.I urge the adoption of the amendment.I am prep*red to yield back my time.Mr. LONG.

Congress hasjust made It possible for a man who isdrawing social security and unemploy-ment combined to equal 100 percent ofwhat he would make if he were workingfull time, his total wages. That soundsnice; but the fact is that if he workshis earnings are taxable, and the socialsecurity and the unemployment insur-ance are not taxable. The net effect ofwhat we have just done here is that aman who does not work gets about 30 per-cent more than if he goes back on thepayroll. So we would be paying him a 30-percent premium not to go back on thepayroll.Unfortunately, this is not in confer-ence; this is now in both bills.

But at this time we wouldnot be in a position\u2014and I think I speakfor the distinguished Senator from NewYork as well as myself\u2014to agree to a timelimitation on those latter two.I yield to the Senator from New Yorkso that he may comment on this lastpoint, Mr. President.Mr. JAVITS. I think the Senate shouldbe advised on this matter, so that It willnot appear that the Senator from Okla-homa and I are failing to cooperate withthe majority leader with respect to alimitation.The fact is that here we are dealingwith a new child care corporation witha $50 million initial capital and In thecontext of the following additional fac-tors:First, the corporation would be mov-ingIntoafieldInwhich we nowspend somewhere around $500 million ayear;Second, we have just had the WhiteHouse Conference on Children, with theobjective of providing for the educationaland other development of youth; andThird, we have very comprehensivebills by a number of Senators on the en-tire matter of child care.The question which faces us Is, Will theestablishment of the child care corpora-tion preempt or conflict with these ad-ditional factors?Nonetheless, I have agreed with Sena-tor HARRIS that we will go through withit and do our utmost to inform the Sen-ate, and let the Senate exercise Its will.It will require a matter of a few hours.probably, In order to really begin to dealwith the subject. I hope Senators willunderstand that with all the good will Inthe world, to expedite It every way In theworld, we simply cannot deal so rapidlywith a subject of that size.Senators will remember that I raisedthis question when the motion to recorn-mit was made. It Is in the bill; the Sena-tor from Louisiana felt strongly that hewanted It in the bill. That Is all right,however, we also have some rights as toadvise the Senate to what we who havebeen working on It for months thinkought to be done about It,,Mr. MANSFIELD. Would the Senatorsuggest a time for the two amendmentsCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEwhich he mentioned would be amenableto such a proposal?Mr. HARRIS. As far as I am con-cerned, on the first two amendmentswhich I have listed, I would be glad toagree to a 30-minute time limitation, 15minutes to a side. But I would prefer\u2014itseems to me that would not hold theSenate up unduly\u2014that they be the firstorder of business tomorrow, rather thango on late tonight. As I have said, thereare only 66 Senators here, and I think Itwould be better to start on this tomorrow.I would agree to a total of an hour onboth amendments, equally divided. Thenwe could go to the child care amend-ments and perhaps agree tonight thatthey would be the last amendments to-morrow prior to third reading.UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENTMr. MANSFIELD. Would the Senatoragree on a 30-minute limitation on thetwo amendments tonight? The Senatorhas mentioned the number 66 severaltimes. The highest number of Senatorswe have had has been 69. So that indi-cates that the Senators are stickingaround pretty closely.I would suggest most respectfully tothe Senator from Oklahoma that aslong as we have gone this far, we oughtto at least take up the next two amend-ments and then see whether we cancome to an agreement on the other twofor tomorrow, if not tonight.Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, I want tobe as agreeable as possible, and I think Ihave been earlier today with respect tothe other amendments that have beeninvolved. Many amendments are notbeing offered by myself and others be-cai se of the press of time, although theyare almost of equal importance to thosewhich have been offered.Perhaps we could make it part of onetotal agreement that we would finish upthese two amendments tonight with 30minutes each, the time to be equallydivided\u2014that is, a total of an hour to-night\u2014and I would hope that we wouldnot use all that time; then the only re-maining amendments would be the twochild care amendments, which could betaken up tomorrow prior to third read-ing. Perhaps we could make that onepackage and thereby shorten the workof the Senate.Mr. MANSFIELD. Would the Senatoragree\u2014as I assume he will\u2014that there bea 30-minute limitation, the time to beequally divided, under the usual pro-cedure, for tonight, and that at the con-clusion, with no time limitation inter-spersed on the two remaining amend-ments, the Senate go to third reading onthe bills, and that at that time there bean hour on the bill itself?The PRESiDING OmCER. Is thereobjection?Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, let us un-derstand this. I do not quite get It. Couldwe have the unanimous-consent requestrepeated?The PRESiDiNG OFFICER. The un-derstanding Is that the unanimous-con-sent request Is that on the two amend-ments tonight there be a half hour,equally divided between the proponentsand the opponents; that two amend-December 28, 1970ments would be offered tomorrow uponwhich no time limit would apply; andthat there would be 1 hour after thethird reading of the bill, a one-hour limiton the debate, to be equally divided.Mr. SCOTT.

Is hisamendment germane to the social secu-rity bill?Mr. MATHIAS. The amendment is toadd a new section dealing with limitingthe State taxation of interstate com-merce.Mr.HOLLAND. Mr.President,I thought the Senate had committed itselfto consideration Only of social securitymatters.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The timeIs now under control, under the unani-mom-consent agreement.Who yields time?Mr. HARRIS. I yield myself 5 minutes.Mr. President, the amendment whichis presently before the Senate has to dowith the financing of the social securitybenefits which, in effect, are now a partof the bill which will be adopted. Underthe committee provision, the increasedsocialsecurity benefits\u2014thatis,pri- manly the increase of 10 percent In so-ial security benefits and the $100 mini-mum and the other improved benefits Inthe bill\u2014would be financed by raising thetaxable wage base to $9,000 and then bymaking certain increases in the tax rateitself. The amendment I offer would raisethe taxable wage base to $12,000 insteadof the $9,000 which the committee recom-mends.It would make certain adjustments inthe tax rate over time, but it has this oneother counter cyclical economic aspect:There is presently a tax rate increasewritten into the law, whether this bill ispassed or not, which would go into effecton January 1, 1971, raising the tax rateby 0.4 percent. The amendment I offerwould increase the taxable wage base to$12,000. It would put off for 1 year the 0.4percent tax rate increase now in the law,and then it would make certain other ad-justments in the tax rate over term.Mr. President, I think it is importantto do this for two very basic reasons. One,as I have indicated earlier, I am firmlyconvinced that the social security taxrate represents presently a regressive taxsystem. It is a flat rate. It is not grad-uated on the basis of income. Further-more, it is limited in the total amount ofsalary upon which the tax is levied.Under the Senate bill, that would be$9,000, and therefore the average lowerand middle income wage earner is over-burdened, and overtaxed, paying morethan his fair share of social securitytaxes as, unfortunately, Is also true un-der our present income tax system.The wage base in 1951, as I said earliertoday in connection with another amend-ment, was $3,600. From time to time,Congress has increased that wage baseuntil its present level Is $7,800. That$7,800, by and large, represents an ad-justment for increases in wages and in-creases in the cost of living since theoriginal wage base was set.To raise the taxable wage base notonly makes the social security tax systemmore progressive; that is, based more onthe ability to pay, but also widens thecoverage so that those who would re-ceive benefits under the social securitysystem would more nearly receive bene-fitson their retirement or disabilitywhich are in accordance with the wagesthey had received while earning wages.Second, the amendment which I offerwould have another Important aspectand that is the economic effect of avoid-ing too immediate increase in the taxrate, deferring for 1 year the effectivedate of present law, raising tax rates byfour-tenths of 1 percent.Mr. President, this country Is in aserious recession. There are millions ofpeople who are needlessly out of work,who are needlessly out of work becauseof the mistaken and misguided fiscal andmonetary policies which have conscious-ly been made effective during thi. ad-ministration by its policies.What we need to do now Is to stimu-late consumer demand and spur theeconomy of the country; otherwise, Isadly fear that unemployment which nowstands at 5.8 percent is going to get worse,and we will continue with a needlesslyslack economy, with jobless lines need-lessly long. If on the 1st of January, ata time when we are in a recession, whenthe economy is down and unemploymentIs up, we put Into effect an increase Inthe social security tax rate, taking outof the private econolily additional mil-lions of dollars, we will add to the re-cession and the slump in the economy.What we should be doing is spurringconsumer demand. What we will do,unless this amendment is enacted, willbe to add to the recession and take moreout of the consumers' hands and moremoney out of the private economy. WhatI propose to do is to make the socialsecurity tax system more progressive byincreasing the wage base taxable up to$12,000 rather than $9,000. I would post-pone the four-tenths of 1 percent tax rateincrease that would otherwise go into ef-fect upder' present law except for thisamendment and increase the tax rateover time after that. By this amendment,there would continue to be a cash surplusin the social security accounts. Therewould not be a deficit In any year. Andover term, as the actuaries for social se-curity have made clear, the fund wouldcontinue to be actuarially sound.Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, will theSenator from Louisiana yield me 2 min-utes?Mr. LONG. I yield 2 minutes to theSenator from Iowa.Mr. MILLER. The irgument advancedby the Senator from Oklahoma on hispending amendment is about the sameas those advanced by him In connectionwith an earlier amendment, which wassubstantially defeated by the Senate. Hekeeps insisting that social security taxesare regressive.As I said earlier, everyone knows that.It has always been that way. As long aswe adhere to the concept of social insur-ance, it always will be that way.Now, if the Senator from Oklahomadoes not want to have regressive taxa-tion, he does not want to have socialinsurance, he wants to have welfare.We might as well throw out the wholesocial security tax system, legislate thebenefits, and take it all out of the generalfund of the Treasury; and we can makean argument for that, too.As a matter of fact, the Senator fromIowa believes that, in connection withbenefits relating to the $100 minimum,there will be hundreds of millions of dol-lars of unfunded liability connected withsuch a provision. Many of these peoplewill receive $100 minimum even thoughthey have only paid a fraction In taxesnecessary to support that $100 minimum.So that if we do not take the moneyneeded to pay for it out of the generalfund of the Treasury, we will take It outof the hides of the workers and especiallythe ones I am concerned about, the lowerpaid workers trying to maintain theirfamilies and getting caught with socialsecurity taxes needed to underwrite this$100 minimum. That, to me, is not fair.I think the way to handle this wouldbe to take the money out of the generalfund of the Treasury into which taxesare generally paid according to relativeability to pay.If the Senator from Oklahoma wantsto do that, I would join him in that; butthat only. Because it relates to benefitsthat have not been funded by the socialsecurity taxes paid by the recipients.That is a unique aspect of social security S 21276which is not social Insurance. It Is wel-fare. But if we are going to adhere tothe concept of social security as beingsocial insurance, then I think we hadbetter understand that we are going tohave to pay taxes in proportion to thebenefits each of us will be entitled to.This is a regressive approach, but it is thenecessary approach if we are going tostick with the concept of social insur-ance.People do not go out and buy insur-ance policies and pay different premiumsaccording to their relative income. Rela-tive income is beside the point. This isa regressive approach. But that is theway to pay for insurance. I think thatwe should be pretty chary about chang-ing the concept of social insurance. Andthat is what we will be doing if the Sen-ator from Oklahoma's amendment Isadopted.Mr. HANSEN. Mr. President, will theSenator from Louisianayield me 2minutes?Mr. LONG. I yield 2 minutes to theSenator from Wyoming.Mr. HANSEN. Mr. President, I toorisetoexpressmyoppositionto the amendment proposed by the Senatorfrom Oklahoma.The amendment wou1d revise the fi-na.ncing of the committee bill by Increas-ing the tax base\u2014$7,800 under presentlaw and $9,000 under the committeebill\u2014to $12,000 a year and by revisingthe schedule of taxes.Under the committee bill, employerand employee taxes are each scheduledto Increase from 5.2 percent next year\u2014this Is also the rate under present law\u2014to 5.5 percent in 1972 and rising In anumber of steps until they reach 7.6 per-cent for 1986 and after.Under this schedule, a person earning$9,000 or more will pay social securitytaxes of $495 In 1972 and $684 in 1986and after.Under amendment No. 1114, the taxrates under the committee bill wouldbe reduced so that In 1972 the rate wouldbe 5.2 percent and rising In a number ofsteps to 7.25 percent in 1985 and after.Under this schedule, a person earning$12,000 or more will pay social securitytaxes of $624 in 1972 and $870 in 1986and after.The amendment fails to take Into ac-count the need to revise the proportionof social security taxes allocated to thedisability Insurance trust fund whicharises when the tax base and schedule oftax rates Is revised.I would point out that the amendmentwas offered in the committee and wasvoted down. I think it Is unfair to Imposethese rates on higher Incomes and thusmake this, as has been pointed out bythe distinguished Senator from Iowa(Mr. MILLER), a welfare bill Instead of asocial security bill.I hope that the Senate will reject theamendment.Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, I yieldmyself 2 additional minutes.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Oklahoma Is recognized for 2additional minutes.Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, I pointout In closing that this amendment post-pones for an additional year the IncreaseCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEIn the tax rate from 4.8 to 5.2 percentwhich is otherwise scheduled to go intoeffect in January 1971, under presentlaw. Instead of the Increase in the wagebase from $7,800 to $9,000, the amend-ment would Increase the wage base to$12,000.The amendment provides for actuarialsoundness, with less of an Increase In thetax rate over a period of years than rec-ommended by the Senate committee.The amendment is important becausethe committee bill and the House bill donot properly take into account the eco-nomic impact of the financing provisionsIn the proposals and do not take into ac-count the presently regressive nature ofthe social security tax system.Unless the rate increase is postponed.it will have a seriously dampening effecton consumer demand at a time when theeconomy is much too sluggish and unem-ployment too high. Stimulation of con-sumer demand through postponement ofthe presently scheduled tax rate Increaseand through increased benefits wouldnot be inflationary in my view and in theview of emirent economists such as Ar-thur Okun, Chairman of the EconomicAdvisers, and others, by serving to causeexpanded production volume, allowingsome reduction In unit cost.By increasing the wage base, ratherthan the tax rate, the social security taxsystem would be made more progressive.Mr. President, I am prepared to yieldback the remainder of my time.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, I yield backthe remainder of my time.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ques-tion is on agreeing to the amendment ofthe Senator from Oklahoma.Mr. HARRIS.

The amendments will be stated.The legislative clerk read the amend-ments, as follows:On page 181, strike lines 1 through 5.On page 301, strike lines 10 and 11.Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, this Isthe last amendment for the night, as Iunderstand it. I yield myself 5 minutes.I refer Senators to the separate viewswhich I filed with committee report onthis bill. Under present law States arerequired to maintain their present finan-cial efforts in support of medicaid andare required to build toward comrehen-sive medicaid programs by 1977.The State of Missouri asked the Sen-ate Finance Committee to pass legis-lationgivingitaspecialone-time exemption from the maintenance of ef-fort requirement under medicaid. The.committee granted that special request,and my amendment would not have any-thing to do with that special request ofthe State of Missouri for the one-timeprovision exempting Missouri from themaintenance of effort requirement; thatspecial provision would still remain inthe bill.But the Senate Finance Committeewent far beyond the special request ofthe State of Missouri and simply re-pealed the maintenance of effort provi-sion altogether.The committee recommended repealof the entire section 1902(d) of the pres-ent law, under which States are requiredto maintain their financial efforts undermedicaid. The House of Representativeshad previously stricken section 1903(e),which requires States to enact compre-hensive medicaid programs by 1977.The recommended repeal of these twoprovisions will become law unless theamendment which I have now offered isadopted. That would be most unfortu-nate. The poor people who are covered bymedicaid are entitled to better medicalattention and care\u2014not less.What we would do, unless the amend-ment is adopted, is to say to the States,\"You do not have to build up a betterand more comprehensive medicaid pro-gram by 1977, as the present law requires;you do not even have to maintain yourpresent efforts, as the present law re-quires. Those requirements are strickenfrom the law.\"What we ought to be doing here Isproviding better medical attention forpoor people, not less. We ought not to bereducing the requirements.If we do that, It seems to me thereS 21281will be less demand for a comprehensivenationalhealthinsuranceprogram, which we should have, and for a massiveincrease in funds for health personnelandfacilitieswhichisdesperatelyneeded. We are going to allow healthcare, which is provided for in the lawand is already inadequate to deterioratefurther.It just seems a shame that a matter asserious as this should come up at 11:30at night, with not the amount of timethat ought to be provided for its consid-eration. This is a backward step so far ashealth care is concerned, aid I hope theSenate will not agree to it.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, I yield my-self 5 minutes.The Senate Committee on Financeconsidered this measure before, in 1969,and we recommended that something bedone about the fantastic increase andenormous waste in the medicaid pro-gram. This was a program which wasoriginally estimated to cost about $230million more than existing expenditurelevels when put into effect. It is cost-ing about 10 times that much. Some ofus have been complaining that, in thefirst years of experience under medicare,it cost twice as much as estimated. Thisone is costing 10 times as much. Whyis it costing so much?We in Louisiana had the most liberal,free medical program inthe UnitedStates prior to medicare. With that pro-gram we provided for all who neededmedical care. On the most liberal basis,we provided medical aid to those whoneeded it.Then the Federal Government provid-ed 70 percent of the matching funds, sothe Federal Government would put up $7out of every $10, meaning that we wouldbe required to provide 200 percent of theneeds in Louisiana. The Governor of Lou-isiana pleaded to be permitted to savemoney under the program, because hewas being required to provide far moremedical care than anybody could justify.He wanted to do that to save the Statesome money. Every time the State wouldsave $1, the Federal Government wouldsave $3. He could not do It, because itwould be against the law to save 5 centsunder the program.I helped write the law, and I apologizefor it. Listen to what it says:Section 1903(e) of the Medicaid statuterequires that each State make \"a satisfactoryshowing that it Is making efforts In the direc-tion of broadening the scope of the care andservices made available under the plan andIn the direction of liberalizing the eligibilityrequirements for medical assistance.\"What does that mean? Even if a Statemeets all the medical requirements ofall the poor people of that State, It Is stillrequiredto go upward and onward,broader and greater, just up and out,just keep moving to make it bigger andmore expensive, and it cannqt save any-thing.So here comes the Senator from Mis-souri (Mr. EAGLETON), former LieutenantGovernor of his State, to plead for Mis-souri, which, together with other econ-omies, was trying to get cutbacks tosave the State from fiscal disaster. Hesaid \"Will you please let us make reduc-tlons In this program to meet a veryDecember 28, 1970 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014SENATE S 21282desperate situation in the fiscal affairs ofthe State of Missouri?\" The State passeda constitutional amendment to try toraise taxes to pay for this program, butthe people voted it down.So at the same time the State is savingmoney, it will save money for the FederalGovernment. Here is California with thesame problem. Texas has a parallel prob-lem. There are problems to a lesser de-gree in other States.Does it make sense to say that we haveall the,.wisdom here in Washington? Ifthe States are doing as much as they canand in so doing the program costs 10times what it was estimated to cost, andthey would like to make some reductions,should not the Governors be able to doso, since they have to account to theirpeople? Should nottheState Rep-resentatives, who have to run even of ten-er than U.S. Senators, be able to fix therequirements for the services? There aresix basic services involved\u2014in-patienthospitalservices, out-patient hospitalservices,other laboratory and X-rayservices, skilled home nursing servicesand others, also visits whether secured inoffice or hospital and home health visits.So they have to furnish all those basicservices. If they do make a saving, theyhave to account to their people.Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, if theSenator will yield, the State does nothave to provide any particular level, butjust some.Mr. LONG. I agree. Admittedly, itwould be conceivable that a State coulddrastically reduce what Itis doing toprovide medical care for its aged or poorpeople in that State. Admittedly, thatcould happen.The committee proceeded on the as-sumption tha the State should havesome power to make a mistake towardeconomy rather than the other way.What is the alternative offered by theSenator from Oklahoma? Ever upwardand outward. Ever onward. Ever moreexpensive, even though there is beingspent 10 times what it was estimated tocost and in some respects it is virtuallyImpossible for the States to meet theirbudgetary requirements.Why should not a State be permittedto have some discretion about this mat-ter? Why not let the States use a little oftheir discretion, and see if they can findwhere some money could be saved? Mr.President, I do not know of any reasonfor a requirement that they should be re-quired to spend ever more, ever upward,for ever broader services. The House ofRepresentatives has tried to provide somerelief in this area. The Senate has triedto provide some relief. It seems to methat at least at some point, we oughtto respect the States and those who rep-resent the people there, and let them beaccountable to their people.One more minute.Mr. President, I was the original spon-sor of these maintenance-of-effort pro-posals. I used to sponsor those proposalsat times when I was personally offeringamendments to try to get Grandpa $5or $10 extra In his welfare check, andsome Governor or some legislature wouldnot pass It through, or would delay It ayear or so, and cut It In half, and thenCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEsay, \"Look what we did for you.\" I want-ed to see if, by Increasing it, maybe thepeople would get a little extra in theirchecks.But at some point, we ought to let theStates have some responsibility In thisarea. Mr. President, in this medicare andmedicaid program, we have workedmightily, and so has the House of Rep-resentatives, to try to reduce waste andeliminate a lot of extravagant expensesand costs. But I know of no way in whicheconomycouldbemoreeffectivelyachieved than to stop implementing alaw requiringStatestocontinueto broaden their programs and continue tospend more money, even though they, intheir best judgments, are spending allthey think they ought to spend on this.Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, I yieldmyself 2 minutes.Mr. President, this is no way to legis-late. The President of the United Stateshas stated that he will recommend toCongress next year some kind of healthinsurance program. I support another.All Senators are aware of the tremendouscost of the medicaid program and thewelfare programs that States have tobear. It is much more than they ought tobear. That is precisely what the Senatewill go into next year, when we bring upthe President's welfare reform bill andrelated amendments.All Senators are aware o the alarm-ingly increasing costs of medical care.That is precisely what we will go intonext year, Mr. President, in consideringthe President's proposals on nationalhealth insurance, and other health in-surance proposals which are pending be-fore the Senate.But this is no way to legislate. Weare taking care, in this bill, of the specialcase of Missouri, on a one-time basis.That is the only State that came beforeus and made a special presentation forrelief. I do not think we have handledthat exactly right, but It is in the bill,and I do not now quarrel with it, andwould not try to take it out or amendIt out now. But, Mr. President, nextyear we can take up these other things.The Senator's position and the com-mittee position does nothing at all aboutrising costs.I yield myself 1 additional minute.It does nothing at all about the short-age of medical personnel, which is onereason why costs have gone up. It doesnothing about trying to hold down un-necessary costs.It simply says to theStates, \"You can reduce care, reduceexpenditures, do anything you please.\"Mr. President, it Is aimed only towardreducing costs, and it leaves out the realsolutions to these problems. It leaves outthe real health needs of the poor peopleof this country, the old people and otherwelfare recipients in this country. It doesnothing at all except back away from theproblem. It just says, \"Do anything youplease to reduce costs, and that will beall right with us.\"I yield myself 1 additional minute.I say that Is not the way to legislate.Let us adopt this amendment, strike thisprovision of the bill that no one is push-ing us for, and all these matters will bebefore us later. I plead with SenatorsDecember 28, 1970not to take this backward step to reducethe quality of medical care, which is al-ready insufficient, at this late date inthis session of Congress.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. Pres-ident, will the Senator yield?Mr. LONG. I yield the Senator fromDelaware 2 minutes.Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. Pres-ident, the Senator from Oklahoma pointsout thatallSenators are concernedabout the rising costs of medicaid.I say to Senators that if you are con-cerned and want to do anything aboutrising medicaid costs, you had better re-ject the amendment offered by the Sen-ator from Oklahoma, because Ifhis amendment carries, there will be no re-duction whatsoever in the medicaid pro-gram for this year, next year, or there-after.Under the law, we would then be in aposition where whatever a State wasspending last year would be a plateau.That would be the spending floor, and allthey could do would be increase expendi-tures each year thereafter.The committee went into this matterin detail and held hearings for severalmonths before this bill even came overfrom the House. We have done a lot ofwork on the rising cost of the medicaidprogram. But with the adoption of theamendment of the Senator from Okla-homa, there would be no reduction what-soever in these costs. The only chancethat we can achieve a reduction is bymaintaining the committee position. Asthe Senator from Louisiana points out,the medicaid program Is costing nowabout 10 tmes what we were told it wouldcost. Let us either vote for economy orelse stop talking about our concern.Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, I yieldmyself 1 additional minute.Mr. President, we would not have anycost at all under medicaid if we just didaway with it altogether. What the com-mittee position asks us to do is some-thing like that. It says, \"Do away withpart of it until the States reduce whatthey spend, and that will cut down thecosts.\"Mr. President, that does not get at therising costs of medicaid. It does not getat the need for better and increased carefor old people and other covered bymedicaid. All it does Is back away fromthe problem, saying it is costing too much,rather than doing something about suchproblems asthe need for additionalmedical personnel and the shortage ofmedical facilities in the country now. Itmerely provides that we will say to theStates, \"Reduce, if you want to, whatyou spend for medicaid, and that willreduce the cost.\"I say that is not the way to go aboutthe matter now, when all these matterswill be before us again this very nextmonth.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, how muchtime remains?The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Louisiana has 7 minutes.Mr. LONG. I yield myself 3 minutes.Mr. President, the Senator from Okla-homa has completely Incorrectly statedwhat the amendment would do. He saysthis amendment tells the States they December 28,1970mustcut. It does not tell them anythingof the sort.Mr. HARRIS. If the Senator will yield,I do not believe I said that. I said thatis the way it is suggested to reduce ex-penditures, by the States reducing whatthey are doing.Mr. LONG. I understood the Senatorto say that this amendment tells theStates they ought to cut their programs.It does not say any such thing as that.Mr. HARRIS. well, I do not believeI said that.ThePRESIDING OFFICER.TheSenate will be In order.Mr. LONG. What the amendment does,Mr. President, Is to permit the Statesto either spend more or spend less. Theway the law reads now, the State has onlyone choice\u2014to spend more, more, more.Even a State like Louisiana, in whichthe Federal Government puts up 7.0 centsevery time Louisiana puts up 30 cents,may be required to provide somewherebetween 250 percent and 300 percent ofthe medical needs of people who are re-garded as being indigent. You still haveto broaden more. Where are you going tobroaden to? Just tax your imagination.That is the way existing law reads.How that got in there I cannot imagine,because I was manager of that bill. Thatwas the language that came to us in theHouse bill. I do not think the House Waysand Means Committee could have beenquite that foolish; that provision had tobe drafted by the Department and sentup here.It says no matter how much you aredoing, that Is not enough, next year youhave to spend more and next year youhave to spend still more, and that nomatter how broad your program is, nextyear It must be broader, ad Infinitum.So then they start saying, \"Why doesnot somebody save some money on theprogram?\"The answer to that is easy: We havemade it against the law. So Louisianacould still spend another $3 million, andthe Federal Government would have tomatch that with $7 million more. Thatisstillpermissible; and if any Statewants to spend more, they will get atleast 50 percent matching funds.But if a State decides, \"If we do that,we are already spending more than weought to spend for this purpose: weought to be able to make some savingson the program,\" that is, against presentlaw.Mr. TALMADGE. Mr. President, willthe Senator yield?Mr. LONG. I yield to the Senator fromGeorgia.Mr. TALMADGE. Does the Senatorfeel that the Senate has greater knowl-edge and wisdom concerning the needsof the States than the combined wisdomof the 50 State legislative bodies and the50 Governors of those States?Mr. LONG. I do not think so, and Iwould challenge anyone to go out and tellhis State legislature that\u2014and we areoften called upon to address our legis-latures\u2014that we haveallknowledgehere, and that no matter how desperatethey might be, they just do not haveenough legislative wisdom to match thelegislative wisdom of this body.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The timeof the Senator has expired.Mr. LONG. I yield myself 1 additionalminute.Mr. TALMADGE. Does the Senatorfeel that this Senate should put the com-bined legislatures of 50 States and 50Governors in a straitjacket as to howthey shalllevy and spend their taxmoney?Mr. LONG. I do not think we should.Mr. President, there may be Senatorshere\u2014I am sure some of the former Gov-ernors\u2014who know more about the prob-lems in the States and the relative de-mands upon the State budgets than dothe Governors and the legislatures oftheir States. But having done this kindof thing to the point of being ridiculousand having a program that exceeds esti-mates by 10 to 1, one would think thatin some area a State would be permittedto have some discretion, and I hope thatwould be true in this instance. This isnot the first time the committee feltsomething should be done about thismatter. We tried to do something aboutit last year, and we did, but we did notgo far enough. We ought to at leastgive the States this small amount ofdiscretion.Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, how muchtime do I have remainingThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator has 6 minutes remaining.Mr. HARRIS. I yield myself 1 minute.Mr. President, there are very obviousways by which we can and should relievethe States of their increasing and diffi-cult burdens with regard to welfare andmedicaid. Some, including the Presidentof the United States, have said we shoulddo it through revenue sharing. Some,including the President of the UnitedStates, have said that we should do itthrough welfare reform which takes partof the welfare burden off the States. Iagee with that principle. There are wayswe can can do something about thehealth costs. Some, including the Presi-dent of the United States, have said weought to have some kind of nationalhealth insurance program. I agree withthat, but I do not think his plan goesfar enough.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The timeof the Senator has expired.Mr. HARRIS. I yield myself 1 addi-tional minute.All these things are going to be be-fore the Senate Finance Committee, andthe Senate will have before it such mat-ters as Increasing medical personnel andgetting at other shortages which havehelped to make costs of medical care skyrocket.The question before us Is, will we, Inthose ways, In a reasonable manner, de-liberately go about trying to solve theseproblems, or will we simply say, \"Re-duce the cost of medicaid by permittingthe reduction In medical services forthose who need it most\"? That is thequestion.SEVERAL SENATORS: Vote! PRESIDING OFFICER. Do Sen-ators yield back their time?S 21283Mr. LONG. I yield back the remainderof my time.Mr. HARRIS.

Mr. President, the pend-ing amendment is the first of two childcare amendments which were covered bythe agreement entered into last night. It December 29, 1970 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATE S 21315would strike that section of the billwhich would create a Federal Child CareCorporation.At this time, I should like to set forth,in brief, an explanation of the amend-ment and the basic reasons why I hopeit will be adopted by the Senate. Then Ishould like to yield to one of the co-sponsors of the amendment, the distin-guishedSenator fromIndiana(Mr. BAYH), for a statement on it. There willbe other Senators who will want t speak on this amendment. I shall reserve myargument-in-chief until other Senatorshave spoken.First of all, Mr. President, the FederalChild Care Corporation which would becreated under this bill, and which wouldbe stricken by the pending amendment,should be stricken, in my view, and inthe view of the cosponsors of the amend-ment, because this is a major piece oflegislation dealing with the children ofthe country and it has not been ade-quately heard. In the press of other busi-ness in the consideration of what cameto be called \"the conglomerate bill,\"where issues such as trade legislation,welfare reform, and social security bene-fits and increases and other major is-sues took up the major attention of Sen-ators and of members of the FinanceCommittee. There has not been a suf-ficient effort to coordinate this piece oflegislation and the creation of this newFederal Child Care Corporation with themany other Federal programs which alsodeal with or touch upon child care or daycare services.Under the provision of the bill whichIs sought to be stricken by the pendingamendment, there would be created aFederal Child Care Corporation to begoverned by a board of directors ap-pointed by the President by and with theadvice and consent of the Senate.The Federal Child Care Corporationwould undertake to provide child careservices under contract with States andlocalitieh and others for children of fam-iliesreceiving welfae assistance andothers.Itis deficient, it seems to me, in sev-eral respects but, first of all, because itIs such a massive piece of legis1ation, Itshould have, as I have said, far morecareful and deliberate consideration.I point out that there is no need torush here, at this late date in this ses-sion of Congress, to pa,ss this kind ofmajor new legislation when, as a matterof fact, as has already been made clearon the floor of the Senate, during theearly days of the next session of Con-gress, this very next month, the newSenate will take up welfare reform asrecommended by President Nixon and byothers. In connection with that bill thatwe will have to consider, child care andday care services, and that will be theappropriate time for us to consider whatwe are about.Second, this provision which is soughtto be stricken is deficient in two furida-mental requirements which I think anysystem of child care services should meet.Those are parental involvement andcommunity control, which are not ade-quately safeguarded by the provisions inthe bill, and I think that they are abso-lutely necessary. All the experts who havedealt with this question think they areabsolutely necessary\u2014that is, parentalinvolvement and community control-\u2014if there is to be a successful program ofchild care and child development.Third, the standards set up in the billare not adequate, They are not adequatein regard to child-staff ratios, not ade-quate in regard to staff qualifications,and they are not adequate in regard tofacility standards. This bill would super-sede State and local standards. Last, butmost important, those standards are notadequate in regard to child developmentconcepts.Will this be mere custodial care?Will there be an educational compo-nent?What sort of standards will have tobe met?What kind of concepts will be insti-tuted under this massive new major childcare program?I think it is well known that a child'searly years are extremely important inintellectual development. I think that wehad better be awfully careful when weset up a new program which will be verymuch like and of equal importance tothe public school programs in this coun-try, 'that we had better be very sureabout what we are doing, and about whatits effect will be upon millions and mil-lions of young schoolchildren in thiscountry.A good many organizations vitally in-terested and concerned in this matter,and very knowledgeable in regard to it,have submitted comments in oppositionto that provision in the bill in its presentform.These include the Child Welfare Lea-gue and the National Association forBlack Child Development. May I say, Mr.President, that I think the day has longsince passed, as I said last night, whenpoor people or black people or other mi-norities will sit idly by while outsiderscome in, as can be done under this pro-vision in the bill\u2014and it could be a pri-vate enterprise franchiser\u2014coming andcontrol the child care and developmentof the children of that community.The Day Care and Child DevelopmentCouncil of America, Inc., Is also one ofthe organizations, together with those Ihave previously mentioned, which arenot in agreement with this provision inthe bill in Its present form.The same is true of the American Acad-emy of Pediatrics. I invite attention toa letter which that organization wroteon December 18,1970, to the distin-guished chairman of the Finance Com-mittee, the Senator from Louisiana (Mr.LONG), in which it is stated in part:The Academy is gravely concerned withthat section of this bill which establishedFederal child care standards. The minimum-al standards prescribed In this legislationwill result in mere custodial care programs,and will severely neglect Intellectual, social,andemotionaldevelopznentalneedsof children.Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-sent to have the entire letter written byRobert G. Frazier, M.D., executive direc-tor, printed In the RECORD.There being no objection, the letterwas ordered to be printed in the RECORD,as follows:AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS,Arlington, Va., December 18, 1970.Hon. RUSSELL B. LONG,Chairman, Finance Committee, U.S. Senate,Washington, D.C.DEAR SENATOR LONG: The American Acad-emy of Pediatrics, the natlonai organizationof board certified pediatricians, wishes to ex-press its concern with S. 4101, establishinga Federal Child Care Corporation. This bill,one of the amendments to the Social SecurityAct reported out by the Senate Finance Com-mittee, would create Title XX of the SocialSecurity Act.The Academy is gravely concerned withthat Section of this bill which establishesfederal child care standards. The minimalstandards prescribed In this legislation willresult in mere custodial care programs, andWill severely neglect intellectual, social, andemotional developmental needs of children.Because S. 4101 further provides that stateand local licensing and similar requirementswould be superceded, much of the construc-tive work and planning done at state andlocal levels to enhance the quality of childcare programs would be negated. Health serv-ices are an integral part of child care andprovisions for an adequate health programare needed.This bill attempts to overcome financialbarriers associated with the establishment ofchild care centers. Although there is a need for such funding, the primary Intent of thisproposal is to help more mothers find gainfulemployment. it Is our opinion that this ob-jective is being achieved at the expense of the child. Adequate provisions do not exist In the bill to assure that high quality child care programs will be established to meet thedevelopmental needs of children.The primary purpose of day care should be to offer a Sound basis for learning and further development of the child and to sup- port and encourage the mother In her efforts to care for her child, Consequently, the Acad- emy would urge that the provisions of S. 4101 be deleted from the Social Security Amend- ments pay de- served tribute to the distinguished chair- man of the Finance Committee, the Sen- ator from Louisiana (Mr. LONG) for his great and laudable concern for the need to expand and improve child care serv-ices available in this country. I believe that mothers receiving welfare assist- ance are entitled to have high qualitychild care available to them.I believe, however, thatwe should notstop there. I think that the other mothers in this country, not just those receivingwelfare assistance, are also entitled to that kind of child care service.I believe it Is terribly important that we not stigmatize child care or day care as being merely a welfare program. I be-lieve that it has got to bea universalprogram which extends far more broad-ly than the present provision would al- low it to do.Mr. President, the distinguished Sen.ator from Louisiana is most well Inten-tioned. But I believe that if we can lay aside this provision in the pending billand take it up again in a deliberate andcareful fashion after the first of the year,we will be able to make some Importantsteps forward in providing adequate childcare services in this country.It is Important that we do that andtake it up again after the first of the year.as we will do if this provision Is stricken S 21316from the bill. As I said earlier, there areso many programs, programs under theCommissioner of Education at HEW, un-der the Office of Economic Opportunity,under Headstart, under HUD to some de-gree, In regard to facilities, and underthe welfare laws in regard to those re-ceiving welfare assistance.It seems tome that we must make somekind of uniform system out of all thishodgepodge we have at present.We will have time to do that if weagree to the motion to strike the presentprovision and go into all of this matterin the kind of detail and with the kindof care it deserves.Mr. President, I am pleased at thistime to yield the floor to one of the dis-tinguished cosponsors of the amendmentwho is quite knowledgeable in this field,the distinguished Senator from Indiana.Mr BAYH. Mr. President,I have listened with a great deal of interest tothe discussion which has been initiatedby my friend, the Senator from Okla-homa. I find myself in a rather uniqueposition, I say to my friend, the Senatorfrom Louisiana, in joining in a motionsuch as that presented by my colleague,the Senator from Oklahoma, whichwould strike the provision for day carefrom the pending legislation.I say this because for over a year, forabout a year and a half now, the Senatorfrom Indiana and his wife, who is hisNo.1adviser inthismatter, havebeen deeply concerned about day care.Together we have examined day carefacilities in the United States, in ourhome State of Indiana, and in the Na-tion's Capital. We have had the goodfortune to compare facilities here withthose available in other countries, suchas the Soviet Union, Great Britain, theHague, Japan, and Israel, just to name afew.In the course of this study, the Senatorfrom Indiana has become convinced thatone of the most critical problems con-fronting us today is the lack of signifi-cant child care and child developmentfacilities in this country.Thus I find myself joining in a motionto strike the child care corporation pro-vision of the distinguished Chairman ofthe Committee on Finance from the bill.Before proceeding further, I would liketo echo the words of the Senator fromOklahoma in paying tribute to the Sen-ator from Louisiana for recognizing theneed that something be done. I do notthink that any of us should take lightlythe suggestion that is made by the Sen-ator from Louisiana, because this is astart. This is an idea which could be,and should be, considered in an overallstudy of the problem of child care anddevelopment in this country.If this problem is as significant as theSenator from Indiana feels it is, I do notfeel that we should start with just asmall crumb, but rather that we shouldgive this problem the study in committeeand in debate on the floor that it SOrightly deserves.Mr. President, we are all aware of someof the very difficult and perplexing prob-lems confronting us today.There is the problem of law and order,the problem of juvenile delinquency, theCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEthe problem of high school dropouts,the problem of welfare, the problem ofthe low capability wage earner, and theimpact that he has on our economy asa whole, the-problem of the obsolescenceso far as individual employee skills areconcerned, the problem of terrible hous-ing conditions, which produce the ghettoand urban blight. These are just a fewof the problems that are tearing at thevery foundation of our society today.There is not a Senator who is not awareof these problems. I think it is fair tosay, or at least that is the judgment ofthe Senator from Indiana, that there isnot a Senator who is not concerned withthese problems.As I have looked over them, particu-larly over the last year, and as I havestudied the potential impact of adequatechild care and development programs, itis my judgment that no one program, ifit is approached in the right manner, ina comprehensive manner, could do moreto alleviate the multitude of problemsconfronting us than adequate child careand development programs.These problems are not going to bewhisked away with one speech on theSenate floor or with the acceptance orrejection of one Senate amendment. Itwill not be done in 1 day, 1 month, 1year, or in 10 years.The problems are the result of generalconditions of neglect and they will notdisappear overnight.The Senator from Indiana thinks thatwith comprehensive planning of ade-quate child care and development pro-grams in our lifetime we can hope toreverse the pathways in those areas ofour country which today lead only todespair.So Iriseto support the proposedamendment to delete the child care cor-poration, not because the Senator fromIndiana does not believe that this par-ticular proposal might not some day bepart of a comprehensive proposal, andcertainly not because he finds fault withthe desires of the Senator from Louisi-ana to bring some legislative input to theproblem, but because the Senator fromIndiana believes that this is a day lateand a dollar short approach to the ques-tion. It can lead some people to believethat the problem is going to be an easyone to solve and that providing adequateday care and child development centersis going to be inexpensive. It is not. Inmy judgment, to do the job adequatelywill cost much more money than mostpeople realize.I cannot think of a better investment.And let us not suggest that we will getsomething for nothing. We have had toomuch of this already in this country.If we are going to give our attentionto the children of America, the Senatorfrom Indiana happens to believe thatthere is no better place to invest ourmoney.I think it is to the credit of the Senatorfrom Louisiana that his original bill authorized $500 million for the FederalChild care Corporation. That would bea good start. However, when the presentmeasure was reported, it contained only$50 million.It Is rather difficult for the SenatorDecember 29, 1970from Indiana to talk about only $50 mil-lion. We are talking about an expenditureof hundreds of millions of dollars, indeedbillions of dollars, if we are going to pro-vide adequate child care and child devel-opment programs for the younger peopleof our Nation.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, will theSenator yield?Mr. BAYH. I am glad to yield to thedistinguished Senator from Louisiana.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, the Sen-ator has introduced a measure to ex-pand child development. His bill wouldstart out by spending $2 billion a yearand go on to spend about $6 billion a year.It may be that a program of this mag-nitude is necessary and that it shouldbecome law some day. But what we aretrying to do in the committee bill is toprovide at least enough child care to seeto It that mothers who want to work tosupplement the income of their familiesare not denied the opportunity to do so.I would like to have had a larger pro-gram than the Committee on Financewas willing to agree upon, but I wouldsubmit that something is better thannothing. The best I can make of the Sen-ator's argument and the argument ofthe Senator from Oklahoma is that noth-ing is better than something.I would earnestly and sincerely hopethat we would not be denied the oppor-tunity of doing what is provided in thisbill to help provide mothers the childcare they need and which will be ade-quate to meet their needs, merely becausewe cannot have the kind of program theSenator would like to have.As far as I am concerned, as a mem-ber of the Committee on Finance, I saymore power to those who serve on othercommittees if they can work out some-thing to provide this kind of child de-velopment program. As proposed, it willcost from $6 billion to $10 billion.But for the life of me I cannot under-stand why the Senator takes the attitudethat although the committee bill onlyprovides $50 million for working cap-ital for the corporation and it increasesthe Federal matching rate from 75 per-cent to 90 percent, it is still not betterthan nothing. It seems to me that thisis a straightforward attempt to makechild care available where it is not avail-able now.If one can go forward with a programfor complete child development as the Senator advocates, more power to him.But I cannot see why the Senator wouldtake the position that nothing is betterthan something, because in my opinionthe committee bill will go a long way to- ward meeting the problem.Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I appreciatethe comment of the Senator from Louisi-ana. As I mentioned earlier, while he wasIn conference, I think he is to be compli-mented for directing this matter to theconscience of the Senate in an attemptto move forward.I find myself in what might be con-sidered by some a presumptuous position,because I have long respected and ad-mired the distinguished Senator fromLouisiana. He has serve in this body formany more years than the Senator fromIndiana, and Is the author of many more December 29, 1970 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATE S 21317pieces of legislation than the Senatorfrom Indiana, but I think lie would bethe first to suggest that we do not solvecomplicated national problems by pass-ing legislation upon which there have notbeen extensive hearings. We have nothad beneft of such hearings.I know the Senator has studied thismatter, but I have been looking at it fora year and a half and I still c'o not haveall of the answers.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, will the Sen-ator yield?Mr. BAYH. I am glad to yield to thedistinguished Senator from Louisiana.Mr. LONG. The Committee on Financeheld extensive hearings on the proposal.For example, I have before me the state-ment of the American Federation ofLabor which was made when they testi-fied on the proposal we are talking about.Admittedly the bill as introduced was abit larger in the amount of money pro-vided for working capital, but baically itwas the same proposlticn. The AFLstated:We support the very constructive and com-prehensive provisions of the day care billIntroduced by the chairman of the commit-tee, which would provide both the financialIncentive and the means to eliminate someof the barriers preventing development ofday care centers.That Is the statement of the AmericanP'ederatlon of Labor. They want childcare for children so that mothers canwork and earn a decent wage. They favorthis proposal strongly.Other groups testified, for example theChild Welfare League of America. Theyhave some suggestions of ways the pro-posal might be Improved upon, but basi-cally they state that\u2014This is an ingenious and innovative planto design and deliver day care and otherchild care services appropriate to the needsof a diverse child population. We agree withthe bill's findings and declaration of purpose.in section 2001, taken in the context of ourunderstanding of the bill's intent What is proposed is a means to discover the kindsof services needed by all children ar,d theirfamilies, and to arrange for the delivery ofthoseservicesinthemostappropriate. timely, and efficient manner possible.So I say again that we did have hear-ings. When I Introduced tic bill on July 20,1 made this statement:Mr. President, it would be my hope thatpersons and organizations interested in childcare would study the bill and present theirviews to the Committee on Finance at thesame time as they testify or submit theirviews on the Family Assistance Act.We had hearings from August 24 toSeptember 10. This matter was discussedby a number of witnesses. Finally thecommittee approved this proposal, withsome modifications.The chairman of the comrnitLee, in in-troducing the amendment on which hiscommittee was conducting hearings, urg-ed all Interested persons to express theirviews on it, and, of course, urged theorganizations to come before the com-mittee to discuss it. If Senators wantedto Ignore the possibility that the amend-ment was going to be voted on, they coulddo so. The chairman asked Senators tolook at the proposal and urged them toexpress their views on it If thQy were in-terested in this type of legislation.Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, will theSenator from Indiana yield?Mr. BAYH. I yield.Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, I wish torespond to the distinguished chairman ofthe committee as a member of the Com-mittee on Finance.IsaidearlierI thought there had been inadequate hear-hgs. I was careful to say why. There wascertainly no reflection on the distin-guished chairman or any indication thathe did not give adequate notice that thismatter was being consicered by the com-mittee. I made clear and I reiterate nowthat there were inadequate hearings onthis provision or any child care provision,because in the consideration of what hascome to be called \"the conglomerate bill,\"we had all we could do to consider thetrade provisions, which encompassed themost important revisions in trade lawsince the Trade Expansion Act of 1962,a new concept of Nelfare reform, whichPresident Nixon advocated and many ofus supported In principle, and concern-ing which many of us had Ideas of ourown; and, of course, there was the socialsecurity bill, with its financing, benefitsincreases, the catastrophic illness planthat the Senator from Louisiana pre-sented\u2014all of these matters were to-gether in one set of hearingsWe had hearings on most of theseprovisions, then started executive ses-sions, then came back for 2 more dayson trade, then the committee went backLto executive session, and there werejust too many riders on one horse; toomany things were Involved in one bill.I presided all one afternoon In theCommittee on Finance. The Senator fromLouisiana was good enough to let me dothat so that I might ask questions par-ticularly about welfare reform. But I didnot begin to get into all the questions Iwanted to ask concerning child care, eventhough I asked as many questions con-cerning it as time would allow on thatday and on other days.The surface of the problem of childcare and development has not even beenscratched. We must really go into thismatter. We will have time next year.There is certainly no reflection on theway the chairman conducted the corn-m.ittee. He did so with complete fairnessand complete notice, but I say that Sen-ators were so burdened down with allof the other provisions of the bill thatthey did not have time fully to considerthis major new proposal of the Senatorin regard to child care.That is what I meant by saying therehave been inadequate hearings on thisprovision and insufficient effort to try tocoordinate this provision with all of themany other Federal programs which re-late to It.Several Senators addressed the Chair.Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I believe Ihave the floor. I would like to make onefurther remark, then I would be glad topermit free discourse.I want the RECORD to show that theSenator from Louisiana was busy Con-sulting with his staff when I started rayremarks. As the Senator from Oklahomahas just done, I salute him for his efforts.I think In the months he has been lookinginto this It should be readily apparenteven on a casual study of this matter,how complicated it is if we are really try-ing to solve the total problem.The Senator from Louisiana has hadso many burdens to carry. I do not knowhow he carries them all. That is why Isaid earlier I hope the critique and con-structive criticism that we are involvedin today is taken in proper perspectiveby our friend from Louisiana.He mentioned a moment ago that hefinds it difficult to see how the Senatorfrom Indiana or other Senators couldsuggest that no solution is better than apartial solution. I think when we arestarting out with a complicated, multi-faceted problem involving adequate childcare and development. If we are to betotally responsible in our efforts to reacha final consideration, the proposal of theSenator from Louisiana has to be takenintoconsideration with other neededaspects of this problem. When we startout we might have to retreat, come backto point zero, and then start again onthe well-intentioned approach of theSenator from Louisiana. That is why Ido not at this particular time, particu-larly at this 11:30 hour In this session,feel that this is the proper way to pro-ceed. After thorough study, it is entirelypossible and conceivable that we will findthere is a proper place for corporationsto play in comprehensive provision ofchildcareandchilddevelopmentprograms.I made a proposal for the considera-tion of the Senate. I did not introduceit because I thought, at this stage of thelegislative process, something that Is ascomprehensive as this should not be in-troduced, since it could not be passed,and it ought to be passed after beingsubjected to minute study and hearingsnext year. But I did put in the RECORDthat the approach to child care wasstudied in detail by the recent WhiteHouse Conference on Children. Frankly,as the result of that conference there aresome changes I want to make before Iintroduce it next year.One thing that comes to, mind is thatthere are a number of child-care centerstoday, concerned that a major nationalchild-care program would make It moredifficult for them to operate. That is notour intentiOn. We want to help thosechild-care centers that are being oper-ated today, and at the same time dosomething about the despicable child-care centers that are not really child-care centers at all, but inadequate cus-todial centers, and some of them I wouldnot want to be caught dead in.I yield to the Senator from Minnesota.Mr. MONDALE. I thank the Senatorfor yielding.The Senator from Louisiana asked thequestion whether something Is not betterthan nothing. The answer to that Is thatto do the wrong thing to children may beworse than to do nothing. What I fearin this pending proposal and why I amsupporting the Javits-Harris amendmentto strike is that the basic philosophy un-derlying the proposal Is to let the moth-er work and store the children some-where while she is working.The question is: Is the emphasis uponthe development of the child or Is It uponletting the mother to get to work? The 8 21318 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEDecember 29,1970trouble with this proposal Is that it is thelatter.It fails to recognize and make provi-sion for the special child developmentneedsofmillionsofdisadvantagedyoungsters who suffer irreparable harmfrom a lack of adequate nutrition, health,and educational assistance in the crucialfirst years of life.It reveals a emphasis on the needs ofadults to find or maintain employmentrather than on the best interest of thechildreninvolved\u2014twogoalswhich sometimes conflict.It contains none of the necessary em-phasis on parental participation andcommunity involvement in child develop-ment efforts.Let me emphasize how important thisparental and community involvement is,Therearehundredsofthousands ofMexican-American,PuertoRican, black, and Portuguese, and other minor-ity group children with different cul-tures, different languages, and differentbackgrounds. Many times those of us inthe white middle class, with the best ofintentions, thrust on those children ournotions, our language, and our ideas,and as a result mangle those children,insult them, put them down by our be-havior. By our example we are saying tothem that their culture is inferior andours is superior. This runs through ourschool system. It is one reason why theywere able to identify in New York Citylast year only 200 Puerto Ricans who gotacademic degrees out of a total PuertoRican student body of a quarter of amillion in that city. We have not beenresponsive to their needs. Yet there isnothing Inthis proposal which willremedy that basic problem. There is nothing to guarantee the parental andcommunity involvement that isnec- essary.Finally, it contains a general thrusttoward full day, full week day care pro-grams without sufficient emphasis onpart time, part day tutoring programssuch as the Infant research project hereIn the District of Columbia which holdso much promise for real child develop-ment.I favor putting more money into crea-tive child development efforts. But in myjudgment there is one over-riding non-negotiablecriteriafordeterminingwhether early childhood developmentefforts should be supported. That cri-terion Is not whether the program en-ables mothers to work, but whether theprogram enhances the child's develop-ment. I do not see this criterion receiv-Ing the priority it requires in the FederalChild Care Corporation proposal.There was just completed in Washing-ton a White House Conference on Chil-dren. Four thousand people came from allaround the country, including many ofour Nation's experts, many of them hav-ing been involved in this problem. One oftheir key recommendations was exactlyIn this area and bears directly on thepoint I have made. That is the recom-mendation of the White House confer-ence to strengthen the family, to bringthe parent or parents and the childrentogether, to have early childhood devel-opment programs that treat the familyas a unit and do not simply stack chil-dren like cordwood in some kind of cus-todial care center while the mother isworking,It so happens that the head of theOffice of Child Development, Dr. Zigler,is one of the most gifted men in thisfield in the world. I commend the admin-istration for finding him and putting himin this position. I am sure that on thebasis of his advice, the Department ofHealth,Education, and Welfare hasurged the adoption of the motion tostrike.How to deal with children in earlychildhood involves the best and mostsophisticated kind of advice that we canreceive. To preempt or to go into thefield with a new corporation, with thiskind of remoteness for the con3jnlmity,and with this kind of job oriented andnonchild development program, seems tome is a step in the wrong direction. It cando more harm than good.For that reason I join the Senatorfrom Oklahoma (Mr. HARRIS) in the mo-tion to strike.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, I wouldhope the Senator would not continue tobeat a straw horse by arguing againstwhat is not in the amendment. The Sen-ator argues that this is something thatforces mothers to go to work. But expe-rience shows that all over the countrythere are mothers who want to go towork but cannot go to work because theyhave no place to leave their children tobe cared for while they are working. Thisprovision of the bill would seek to pro-vide that opportunity where it does notexist now.The Senator somehow assumes thatthe committee bill is not concerned withthe welfare of Individual children. Butlet us look at the aim of the Corporation,as stated on page 420 of the bill. Thelanguage of the bill requires the Corpo-ration to \"promote the well-being of allchildren by assuring that the child careservices provided will be appropriate tothe particular needs of the individualsreceiving such services.\"Mr. President, child care provided bythe Corporation may well include thecomprehensive child development pro-grams of the kind the Senator wouldlike to provide for all children. But notall child care need be of that type. Forexample three out of four children onwelfare are school age children. Sincethey are already going to school, theydo not need an educational programafter the school hours are over. For mostschool age children, it should be sufficientto provide them a good recreational pro-gram, both outdoors and indoors. Afterall, what kind of things do school agechildren do iftheir mothers are notworking? Typically, after school theyplay in the backyard or on the play-ground, or watch television with theirfriends.Now, as to the scope of the corpora-tion's operations, this provision is notlimited to people participating in thework incentive program, or to other peo-ple on welfare. This Is and has been allalong, since I first introduced the pro-posal, Intended to help all mothers whowent safe and adequate child care fortheir children. They should have an op-portunity to get the kind of child carethey want, provided either at their ownexpense or, if they are drawing welfareassistance, at the expense of the Gov-ernment. The committee bill is not at allintended to segregate children on welfarefrom other children; it is in fact intendedthat all kinds of children be provided thecare.As it stands now, out of at least 7 mil-lion children who need child care becausetheir mothers work, there are only 700,-000 of them who are ir any kind of li-censed child care facility at all. The billprovides standards; perhaps the Senatorwould like to hi -e them higher. Thestandards in the bill were very carefullyconsidered, and we think that they areabout as high as can be reasonably re-quired at the present time. We do providestandards to guarantee such things assafety and healthfulconditions. Themain thing is that the bill provides amother with a variety of choices of kindsof child care if she lives in a city thatis large enough to have a number ofchild care facilities.Just to outline briefly some of the kindsof standards the committee bill provides,Mr. President, we stipulate what the ra-tio of children to staff must be; we stip-ulate that the facility must meet the LifeSafety Code of the National Fire Pro-tection Association, the nationally recog-nized and accepted fire safety code; andwe provide that there must be sufficientspace both indoors and outdoors. Thuswhere today at least 90 percent of thechildren of working mothers are in fa-cilities meeting no standards whatever\u2014if they are in any facilities at all\u2014wewould hope to reverse that, and have vir-tually all of the children in facilitieswhich do meet these standards.The Senator has talked about parentparticipation as though this is hamperedby the bill. The opposite is true. The dif-ficulty today is that when parents try toget together to set up child care servicesfor their children, there is no one tohelp them. The committee bill will helpthem. Let me read from page 338 of thecommittee report:Child care services organized by parents orrun with extensive parent participation haveshown great promise in raising the educa-tional level of disadvantaged children in de-privecl areas. Groups Interested in promotingparent involvement should find it possible toestablish child care facilities through theCorporation where they are unable to do sotoday.We provide someone to whom they cango, who can help them to set up exactlythe kind of child care facility with pa-rental participation that the Senatorthinks desirable. The Corporation willhelp them by providing training, by pro-viding them with the technical assistanceand information they need, and by ad-vancing initial operating expenses.Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, will theSenator permit me to raise a couple ofquestions?Mr. LONG. Yes.Mr. BAYH. He has great familiaritywith this particular bill.Suppose the parents of a given com-munity feel one thing should be done, Deceniber 29, 1970 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATE S 21319and the authority for establishing thisservice under the bill feels something elseshould be done for the children. Whorules the day in a situation like that?Mr. LONG. The mother makes the de-cision as to what kind of child care fa-cility the child will go in.Mr. BAYH. But the standards, the pro-graming, the type or lack of compre-hensive care available at any facility isnot determined by the parents involved,but the vehicle for governing it estab-lished under the corporation; is that notaccurate?Mr. LONG. The Corporation wouldmake a contract with the provider ofchild care services. If it is a group ofparents who wish to establish a childcare facility, then the Corporation wouldmake the contract with those parentsand they would proceed to establish aday care center. But the Corporationmight also contract with a day care cen-ter already run by a city, or one run bya nonprofit organization. But the mainpoint I want to make to the Senator isthat it is the mother who would have thechoice as to whether she wanted to sendher child to this child care center or thatchild care center, or whether she wantsto join with other parents in organizinga new child care center instead. In thefirst and last analysis, the choice restswith the parents of the child.I want to point out also that the billdoes not require that the State use theservices of this Corporation at all. If theState thinks It can do a better job, it cando so. Frankly, the fact is that the Statesare now doing a pitiful, miserable job inarranging for child care. They are noteven using 50 cents on the dollar of Fed-eral funds appropriated for this purpose.In effect we are saying to the States, \"Ifyou cannot get the job done, we will putsomeone in business who will do It foryou.\"Let me take a moment to documentwhat I have said about the States' failureto utilize child care funds. We all knowthat there Is a crying need for child carefor mothers who would like to work, toprovide additional family Income, to putmeat on the table and milk in their chil-dren's mouths. Now then, what happenedin fiscal year 1969? The Federal Govern-ment appropriated $25 million for childcare, but what did the States use? Only$4 million. In fiscal year 1970, we appro-priated $52 million for child care, andhow much of this were the States ableto use? Only $18 milion out of the $52million.In the committe2 bill, we change theratio from 75 percent Federal matchingto 90 percent, and we also have a stipula-tion that the States must continue tospend at least what they are spendingnow. That should mean at least 3 timesas much money available for child care.But that will do us little good if we haveto rely on the performance of the States.We must do more than just increasingthe matching. We must also provide amechanism for making child care avail-able. We say to the States, if you don'twant to provide child care yourselves, wewill get the best experts we can find, andhave them arrange for child care serv-ices. Here is someone who will do the jobfor you if you don't want to.This is about the same kind of situa-tion as when one wants to decorate hishome. He car' do it himself, or he can hiresomeone to do it for him, or work withsomeone he has hired to do it for him.Most people are better satisfied if theyhire somebody who has some credentialsas an interior decorator, but they do nothave to do it that way.Under the committee bill the States,if they want to, can do exactly as theyhave been doing, though overall there islittle to be proud of, or they can do itthe other way by doing business with theCorporation, and the Corporation canthen proceed to arrange for child carethe way that we think, on a nationwidebasis, it should be done. The Corpora-tion will be accountable to the Congressto explain what they have or have notdone, just as I would like to have Mr.Richardson explain what his departmenthas failed to do. I would like to ask him,'Now, when we gave you money to meetthis crying need for child care, why didnot you spend it and get the job done?\"Now that we are proposing to givesomeone else the job, Mr. Richardsoncomes along and says, \"Oh, we do notwant to shake up our bureaucracy. Wewould prefer to do business as usual.\"Our reaction to this is: If you cannotget this job done, Mr. Richardson, thenwe want to set up an organization thatcan get this job done. The Corporationwill be headed by a three-man board,with 3-year terms, one member's termexpiring every year. We will want thatboard to be accountable to the Congressfor its activities to provide for the careof children.If a member of that board fails to per-form the function we intend, we will notreappoint him. As far as I am concerned,the Committee on Finance will not con-firm any of those people for reappoint-ment unless they show us they are doingwhat we are trying to do: namely, providethese mothers with adequate child carefor their children.Mr. HARRIS and Mr. BAYH ad-dressed the Chair.Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, I want toanswer that question about what hashappened up to now.Mr. BAYH. Well, suppose the Senatorproceeds first.Mr. HARRIS. As the Senator fromLouisiana knows, there is a great differ-ence between the present situation andwhat the Secretary of Health, Education,and Welfare recommends. Under presentlaw, there Isarequirement that theStates put up 25 percent of the costs. TheStates are hard pressed, as the Senatorknows, and have not been able to comeup with their portion of the moneyrapidly enough.What the Secretary recommends and Isupport is that we Increase that Federalmatching, and then we will see greateraction. But the Secretary made It quiteclear that the principal reason why they1ave not had the necessary support fromthe States in getting these programsunderway is that It requires too much Inthe way of new contributions from theStates.What the Senator would do, Instead,would be to set up a totally parallel sys-tem, parallel to HEW and related ad-ministrativeofficesandemployees, which, goodness knows, seem to be quitea few already. He would set up a totallynew corporation,paralleltoexisting agencies. They would have their ownregional offices and some local offices, Ipresume, and some national offices andsome employees. That, it seems to me,would be a terribly duplicative and in-efficient use of funds.Mr. BAYH. The Senator from Okla-homa pointed to one aspect on which theSenator from Indiana wanted to touch.From what the Senator from Indiana hasbeen able to ascertain from the resultsof his study\u2014and I would suppose fromwhat the Senator from Oklahoma hassaid and from what the Senator fromMinnesota said earlier\u2014little questionhas been raised about the expertise of theindividuals who are nor, running theOffice of Child Development. The ques-tion is how we give them the flexibility,how we take the chains off, give themthe resources and say, 'All right, get thejob done.\"I think that establishing a separateentity and a new element of the bureauc-racy and suggesting that, with minimalfunds, they are going to be able to do anybetter than the other administrativeagencies have been doing is begging thequestion.Let me, if I may, touch on the size ofthe job about which we are talking, andthen we can talk about some of the de-tails of how we are going about doing It.This problem is of critical proportionseven though it is not readily apparent tothe average citizen who hears us discussit on the floor of the Senate or who readsabout a proposal In the newspaper orhears about It via the electronic media.Today, in our country, we have 14million children with working mothers.If we are going to set up rigid standardsfor qualification under a given bill, It seems to me that we have to recognizethat only a small percentage of this 14million total are going to be able to quali-fy. Of these 14 million children, we needto recognize that 2.8 million workingmothers today are the sole support oftheir families.I, for one, do not for a moment sug-gest that It Is other than laudatory for amother to work if she feels that sheshould work and has the opportunity todo so. I do not think she need be whip-ped over the back, if she has small chil-dren at home, to go out and work.Perhaps she is needed in the home toprovide love, kindness, and guidance forthose children. But ifIt is her desireand if it is possible for her to find gainfulemployment, I think this Is fine.I think that what we are arguing abouthere is the kind of facility that Is avail-able for her. In the past, almost all at-tention\u2014particularly official attention, unfortunately\u2014has been directed at cus-todial care. If we are talking about solv-ing the problems that confront us to-day, it has to be more than custodialcare. It has to be child care and devel-opment\u2014not just care.Like It or not, we have to look at thepresent figure of2.8 million workingmothers and recognize the trend that hasoccurred. In 1940, 10 percent of the work-i.ng mothers had preschool children, In S 21320the 1960's, it was 40 percent. The trendindicates that in 1970 it is going to be ashigh as 70 percent. If we think theproblem is great now, it is going to beeven greater, and we want to start witha program that can ultimate1y cope withthe gigantic size of the problem.One thing that concerns the Senatorfrom Indiana is that we need to makethis a comprehensive care program, notjust custodial. It needs to deal with theproblems of health, nutrition, environ-ment, and all the other aspects that leadto the development of an adolescent and,hopefully, an adult who can go out in so-ciety and fend for himself and shake offthe shackles of neglect that may havebeen on the shoulders of his parents.Also, I want to emphasize again thatwhen we are talking about $50 million,I think we almost, by definition\u2014if notspecifically\u2014byadministration,are going to confine that to the most desper-ate need dollarwise. Today, one of theunique characteristics of child care anddevelopment Is that it Is not needed justby the poor and by those who live in theghettos; but, increasingly, large numbersof middle-income families have motherswho are now working. As the cost of liv-ing goes up, there has to be a second wageearner in more and more homes to footall the bills. So we find middle-classmothers going to work, and there is noplace at all to care for their children.Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-sent to have printed in the RECORD anabbreviated section-by-section analysisof the proposal to which I alluded ear-lier, which was the subject of a floorstatement, of a bill I intend to introducenext year.

December 29, 1970 SEC. 20\u2014AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONSFiscal year 1972, $2 $6 billion.Mr. BAYH. I think the Senator fromLouisiana was accurate when he pointedout that some of these children are notgoing to need babysitters. Some of themare going to need a playground, a warmroom. Too many children today rushhome with the key around their neck,with nobody there but perhaps the ratsthat scurry around the tenement. So Isalute the Senator from Louisiana forhis goal to have maximum flexibility. Iam concerned however that we really arenot going to have maximum flexibilityunder his bill, the way it is written.I do not criticize the Senator fromLouisiana for this, but I think we needto recognize that if we accept as a be-ginning this type of minimal program,we are providing a sedative to deal witha problem that requires a comprehen-sive, costly program. I want an efficientprogram. I want $1.10 worth of deliveryfor every dollar we spend, if that Is pos-sible. But let us not deceive ourselves.This is going to cost a lot of dollars. As Isaid earlier, I cannot think of a betterplace to invest our dollars.One of the significant aspects of thisbill about which I still am concerned de-spite the very thoughtful discussion bythe Senator from Louisiana in answerto a question I posed is that it doesnot provide for the type of local controlwe need. We have in this bill approxi-mately five pages of standards which, asI understand them will have to be ap-plied universally. One of the things weneed to recognize is that the problemsthat exist today in poverty and in urbanblight are not solely problems that canbe solved In the classroom. We have toget people involved\u2014mothers involved,fathers involved. We have to make thisa family operation. The more we can getlocal people involved in deciding whattheir children need, the more chancewe have of finally breaking the shacklesand moving forward with a total pro-gram. That is why in the proposal ofthe Senator from Indiana and in theproposal of some others, we provide fordirect involvement of mothers and fath-ers in planning and administration ofprograms.Iiote that the National AdvisoryCouncil on Child Care, established bythe well-intentioned proposal ofthe Senator from Louisiana points out\u2014andI read from page 441 of my bill:And the remaining appointed membersshall be selected from Individuals who arerepresentatives of consumers of child care(but notincluding more than one individualwho Is either a recipient of public assistanceor a representative of any organization whichis composed of or represents recipients ofsuch assistance).I wonder whether this is really givingus an opportunity to have on that ad-visory .councjl enough individuals whoreally are directly affected by the prob-lems of poverty and neglect which un-fortunately confront too many of ourchildren today.Mr. President, I do not want to belabor.this matter any more and I would hopethat the Senator from Louisiana wouldtake this criticism of the Senator fromIndiana in the light in which it is given.As I said earlier, perhaps there is aplace for such a corporation, but it shouldbe determined after comprehensive hear-ings and study by committee and thor-ough discussion by this body. Then letus come forward with a full-fledged billand a comprehensive program that canrealize that children are individuals andwhat we are trying to do is to say thatevery individual born in this country hasequal access to the American dream,which we talk about but unfortunately,large numbers of our children never havethat opportunity.I might make one closing reference tothe White House conference, because theWhite House conference came along afterthe introduction of several bills and theproposal of the Senator from Louisianaand the Senator from Indiana. It broughtunder one roof, I suppose, more expertsboth at the national and grassroots level,experts concerned about and familiarwith the problems of children, than Ithink has ever been brought together be-fore. They wrestled with problems weare wrestling with now.A fair consensus of their suggestionswould be that they feel only a compre-hensive approach can solve the problem.I hope we will not be satisfied withjust a crumb. We have been satisfied withcrumbs for too long as far as our chil-dren are concerned. We speak In lauda-tory terms about the need to care for ourchildren, along with the need for mother-hood, God, and the American flag.The time has come to stop talking andstart making some significant invest-ments in this area.Unfortunately, the investment thatwas originally intended by the Senatorfrom Louisiana has now been cut to one-tenth of its original proposal and, In thejudgment of the Senator from Indiana,that is not sufficient for what we reallyneed to have done.I appreciate the courtesy of the Sen-ator from Louisiana, and to learn fromdiscussing with him, his interest in thisproblem.I am hopeful that out of this debatewill come not just a temporary .solution,or a beginning but, Indeed, the founda-tion on which we can build an ultimatesolution to the i5roblems that confrontour children.I notice that Carl Rowan, an outstand-ing columnist, who has served his coun-try well, wrote a stimulating and per-ceptive column not long ago about theproblems of poverty, the poverty change,and the poverty cycle. He said that weare never really going to be able to breakthe poverty cycle of \"Poor home, pooreducation, poor job. Poor home, pooreducation, poor job. Poor home, poor edu-cation, poor job,\" until we are able toharness the system of public educationto achieve that end.Many of us who have studied the prob-lems that confront young Americans to-day, teenagers, pre-teenagers, which un-fortunately they carry with them to theirdying days, have to recognize, that thetraditional definition of school, as givenin the admonition by Carl Rowan, can-not be accepted today, If we are goingS 21321to solve these problems. All too often,we provide a first-class educational op-portunity for a first-grade, 6-year-old,only to find that because of the horribleenvironment to which that young, im-pressionable human being has been sub-jected during the first 6 years of Its life,because of malnutrition, or undernour-ishment from the point of conception,this young human being may be men-tally retarded, and unable to take fulladvantage of a first-class educationalopportunity.The Head Start program, which wasone of the most innovative devices wehave developed to recognize the need tostart early, if we are going to deal withthese problems, has not been totally suc-cessful because we learned that we can-not take a young 5-year-old or 4-year-oldout of Its horrible environment In thesummer, or during the year, and thensubject them to that same horrible en-vironment for the rest of their younglives and expect not to have almost totalregression.What we need Is a program to startearly. As soon as a mother wants to leaveher child in a day care development cen-ter, she should have the opportunity todo so. If the mother wants to work, fine.We should have a total, comprehensiveprogram that deals with education, aswell as custody, and with medlca, nu-tritional, and environmental problems.They should be administered during outof school and after school hours. Weshould care for the problems of a motherwho works from midnight to 8 a.m. orfrom 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. These are compre-hensive problems. We cannot just scratchthe surface of the problems and expect toget any results.So it is with this thrust In mind thatwe should have a program that trulystarts with the child, Its needs for serv-ices, and the family needs for services,and its continuance through the earlyteens, if necessary, until we finally getthat child on its own two feet, so thathe or she can hold its head high, havepride and dignity, and the capacity tomove out on its own and make for him-self or herself a meaningful life.I know that the Senator from Louisi-ana wants to accomplish this goal. I amjust concerned that the vehicle he pre-sents us with, although well Intentionedand with the study he has brought toIt, Is not going to do the Job that needsto be done.That is why I, with great reluctance,find myself on the opposite side of an is-sue on which I know the Senator fromLouisiana, the Senator from Indiana, theSenator from Oklahoma, the Senatorfrom Minnesota, and others, want tosee resolved. We are looking down theroad and we see that shining momentwith the opportunity to accomplish thesame goal but appear, at least for thepresent, to be wanting to travel differentpathways to reach that goal.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, the prob-lems existing here, I find, strongly paral-lel the problems of providing public serv-ice employment to the needy.The Finance Committee, In looking atthe welfare problem, felt that one wayto help would be to provide jobs In thepublic sector. So it was suggested by theCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATE S 21322 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEDecember 29, 1970Senator from Connecticut (Mr. RInI-coFF) and the Senator from Oklahoma(Mr. HARRIS) that as part of the bill,we should provide some public servicejobs, about 30,000, at least, to provideopportunities for people to do somethingthat would benefit the community.That was included in the bill. The ad-ministration was not particularly en-thusiastic about it, but they went alongwith it. I believe the motion agreed towas made by the Senator from Georgia(Mr. TALMADGE), but the committee gen-erally shared that worthy purpose. TheseSenators agreed that we would do whatwe could to gain as much acceptance aswe thought we could get for public serv-ice employment, to put people to workwho otherwise would be on welfare.There are many kinds of public serv-ice jobs that need to be done, from help-ing to clean up neighborhoods, to serv-ing as policemen, teachers, or nursingaides. With this goal in mind, we suc-ceeded in providing about 30,000 publicservice jobs in the Committee bill.Meanwhile, the Committee on Laborand Public Welfare had a much moreambitious plan. They reported a bill,which I voted for, starting out in 1972with 400,000 public service jobs, morethan 10 times as many as we have in ourbill; and in 1973, 500,000 public servicejobs.But the President of the United Statesvetoed that bill. I voted to override thePresident's veto. I would be happy tohave 500,000 public service jobs madeavailable. If we cannot provide a job inthe private sector, public service em-ployment is better than having a per-son living on the dole.The devil finds works for idle handsto do. It is certainly better to put thesepeople to work than to have them sittingaround doing nothing. We should putthem to work doing something useful.But that attempt to create public serv-ice jobs failed In spite of the good workof the Labor and Public Welfare Com-mittee. The President vetoed the bill. Wetried to override the veto, but failed. Sothat was the end of it.Let us now look at the problem thatexists In the child care area. In the 1967amendments we tried to provide an op-portunity for everybody on welfare tohave an opportunity to have trainingand to get a job, a subsidized job, if needbe. We realized that to provide this kindof opportunity -formothers, child carewould have to be available.This year we undertook to try to findout why It was that the Labor Depart-ment was such a miserable failure atmaking the' program work. We foundthat mothers wanted to go to work, butcould not obtain child care for theirchildren.Twenty-five million dollars was ap-propriated to HEW in fiscal 1969 t pro-videchildcareforchildrenifthe mother wished to work. What did theDepartment use? It used only $4 millionof the $25 million which we appropri-ated. We provided six times as muchmoney as was used to provide child care.Thisyear,we appropriated moremoney to provide adequate child care sothat those mothers who wished to couldwork. We provided $52 million. The De-partment of Health, Education, and Wel-fare spent $18 million.Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, will theSenator yield?Mr. LONG. I yield.Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, will theSenator state on what matching basisthe expenditures were provided and whatthe matching basis is that the Secretaryof HEW now recommends that funds beprovided.Mr. LONG. It is on a 75-percent basistoday. In the committee bill, we raisethe matching to 90 percent.We would like to increase the childcare expenditures well beyond $52 mil-lion. Going in the direction desired bythe Senator, we think we need a biggerchild-care program. But we also find thatthere is a need to give the responsibilityfor providing this care to someone whoknows how to do the job.The Senator talks about States nothaving adequate funds. But they havenot used the funds that we have alreadyprovided. The man in the administrationwho is an expert In this area, Mr. Zigler,in describng to the committee the prob-lems in expanding child care, said:I think it Is probably true that there havebeen so many demands placed on both profitand non-profit groups that in certain in-stances itIs becoming ridiculous becausethere is overlapping responsibility on thepart of local people, State people, and soforth. I think if we are serious about settingup a worthwhile social institution such asday care for working mothers we may haveto develop guidelines at a national levelwhich would have some nationwide applica-tion. It would be a standard process becausenow it is too difflcult and it is too rigid, andI am very much afraid the professionals haveoverdone themselves here.Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, does itnot do one other thing? Does it not setup another overlapping and duplicatingagency, the new child care agency?Mr. LONG. It takes the Secretary ofHEW, who has failed completely in pro-viding child care, and the Secretary ofLabor, who has also failed completely inthis effort, out of the picture as the ex-clusive providers of child care services.Mr. HARRIS. I believe that a Senatorsaid earlier that the States are confusedover whether to proceed under the pres-ent system or under the new system. Itwould not take them out of the picture.It would add one other factor.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, the billwould create a corporation composed ofpeople who know something about childcare.Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, will theSenator yield?Mr. LONG. I yield.Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, the Senatorfrom Louisiana does not want to leavethe impression that the present directorof the Office of Child Development doesnot know anything about child care.Mr. LONG. On the contrary. He isa good man. He would be a fine man toserve as chairman of the board of theCorporation. But I would like to put thisresponsibility in a new organization thathas the ability to get this job done. If theboard does not get the job done, we cando something about it.Secretary Richardson has 50,000 otherworries, not the least of which is tryingto get the Iamily assistance plan passedin this Congress.We would put this responsibility on theCorporation. There would be three mem-bers of the Corporation's board. Theterm of one member would expire eachyear. If the members of the board donot get the job done, then we will askthem when they come up for reappoint-ment why they failed.We have also found that there areall sorts of problems concerning overlyrigid State and local standards requiredof child care providers.I think that anyone who has been aGovernor or a mayor knows how thesethings happen. Someone has some kindof material, and he thinks it would bea great thing if there was a requirementthat his type of material be used inpublic buildings. This is then made partof the building code.There is a lot of space in good, mod-em church buildings that could be madeavailablefor child care centers. Thespace is used for Sunday schools, but itis not made available for child care pur-posesbecauseofrestrictivebuilding codes.We say that there should be Federalstandardsforday-carecenters.For minimum safety standards, we would usethe life safety code of the National FireProtection Association. That is a na-tionally recognized safety standard. If abuilding meets that standard, it will beadequate or a child-care center.The bill also provides $50 million ininitial operating capital for this corpora-tion to train people to work in child-carecenters and to sign contracts with groupsto help them provide child care. Subse-quently, the corporation would be au-thorized to borrow $50 million annuallyto help construct addiional facilities.That authorization would go into effect2 years in the future, and would probablybe used sparingly.With the provisions in the committeebill, there ought to be at least three timesas much money available for child careas was available in the post.And, together with more money forchild care, we want an organization inthe child-care business that knows some-ing about providing it. Let us not forgetthat more than 90 percent of the childrenwhose mothers are working are eitherreceiving no child care or are receiving itin child-care centers that could not meetany standards whatever.We provided standards in the commit-tee bill that we thought would be ade-quate. There are health standards. Thereare nutritional standards, and standardsto assure adequate indoor and outdoorspace.We provide that the purposes to pro-mote the well-being of all children by as-suring that the child care services pro-vided will be appropriate for the partic-ular needs of the individual receivingsuch services. The whole proposal Is cen-tered on the good of the child.Mr. PASTORE. Mr. President, will theSenator yield?Mr. LONG. I yield. December 29, 1970 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATE S 21323Mr. PASTORE. Mr. President, whatis the corporation the Senator mentions?Is is a national corporation?Mr. LONG. It is a national corporation,called the Fedeial Child Care Corpora-tion.Mr. PASTORE. It would be appointedby whom?Mr. LONG. The Board of Directors,consisting of three members, would beappointed by the President. There wouldalso be an advisory council committee of15 members, the majority consumers ofchild-care services.Mr. PASTORE. How far would thatjurisdiction extend? Would it preemptthe jurisdiction of the State?Mr. LONG. It would not. The Statecould contract with this Corporation toprovide for child care if it so wished, butit would not be required to.It couldmake its own arrangements for childcare. Frankly, as the situation existstoday, most States are doing little in thechild-care area. Under the proposal, theState could contract with the Corpora-tion, which will have the capability ofproviding the child-care services, if theState wishes them to do so.Mr. PASTORE. Could they not do thatwithout the corporation?Mr. LONG. They could not contractwith a Federal corporation that does notexist. Of course, without a corporationthe State could contract with some groupthat they hope would assist them in pro-viding child care.Mr. PASTORE. If we give them this90 percent the Senator talks about, theyput up their 10 percent. Why could notthey on their own exercise exclusive jur-isdiction to provide these facilities?Mr. LONG. They could. The problemis that it is not being done now.Mr. PASTORE. What guarantee do wehave it will be done with the Corporation?Mr. LONG. The Corporation would beexclusively interested in and involvedwith making child-care services avail-able.Mr. PASTORE. Does the Senator meanthe Federal Government is not?Mr. LONG. The Federal GovernmentIs interested to the extent of providingmoney for child care, but we are not get-ting results. We have a crying need forchild-care services, but Federal funds gounused for lack of a mechanism to ac-tually assure that child-care services aremade available.Mr. PASTORE. Maybe we did not getresults because the matching was 25 per-cent against the 10 percent now. Maybethey did not have the money.Mr. LONG. That is what one Senatorsaid, but testimony before the FinanceCommittee has shown that there areother reasons. Here is what Mr. Ziegler,head of the Office of Child Development,said about this problem.He said that overly rigid local ordi-nances designed to protect the physicalwelfare of the children have been en-acted at the expense of the psychologicalwell-being of the children and that heaccordingly does not find himself in sym-pathy with some of the things now beingdonc in the child-care field.He meant that some States pass lawswith regard to child care which may betoo restrictive. The committee bill sim-ply sets Federal standards and say thatif a facility meets these standards, thenit complys with whatever requirementsmay be necessary for a child-care center.Why is there a big argument againstwhat we are trying to do here? Thiswould put an organization in the child-care business that is exclusively inter-ested in child care, a corporation thatwould succeed in accomplishing what wehave been unable to achieve thus far.One problem is that the President helda White House conference where somepeople came up with some elaborate,albeit worthy ideas about child care. Itwas said that there are perhaps 5 mil-lion children who could benefit from anoverall program to develop them educa-tionally and culturally. It would cost atleast $2,000 each to provide these chil-dren with the kind of care they wouldlike to see; $2,000 multiplied by 5 mil-lion children is $10 billion.Most of the people attending that con-ference said, \"If that is all It takes, $10billion, then that is what we shouldhave\u2014a program that does everythingin the way of child development andnothing less than that.\"The Senator from New York has aproposal providing for about $3 billionin child development funds. The Sena-tor from Indiana has a bill based on thesame philosophy which would cost about$6 billion. The Senator from Minnesotahas a bill that could cost more than $6billion. These ambitious ideas may cometo pass, and it is all right with me if theydo. I will applaud them If they comeabout.But in our immediate efforts under thebill we are trying to effectively spendabout $300 million to provide child carefor mothers who want to work. We do nothave to provide $2,000 a child for all thesechildren. Seventy-five percent of thechildren in AFDC families are of schoolage. They do not need further educa-tion in any extensive manner after schoolhours. Let us provide supervised recrea-tion for them, or whatever would be ap-propriate for some other constructiveactivity for children. That would not cost$2,000 per child. The chances are that$500 a child would be enough, and thatwould provide for 75 percent of the chil-dren.The objection has been made that wemust guaranteeparticipationofthe mother In all child care programs. Iwould like the mothers to participate.Under the bill they would be free to or-ganize and form a child care center aslong as it would meet minimum stand-ards. We would be happy to have sucha child-care center sign a contract withthe Corporation, and the State welfareagency could sign a contract to pay forthe child-care services provided. Parentgroups that cannot set up child-carecenters today would be able to do sothaniks to the Corporation.In short, here is a mechanism thatwould make available good care for chil-dren during the time the mother is n&table to look after them. It may be thatone of these days the Committee on La-bor and Public Welfare will come outwith a bill for a comprehensive programcosting $3 billion, $6 billion, or $10 billiona year. The way matters have been goingwith some of these highly motivated pro-grams which the Committee on Laborand Public Welfare has reported, suchas the manpower bill, a comprehensivechild care bill will probably be vetoedand we will try to override the veto andfail. In the meantime, why should wefail to enact this modest provision forchild care?At the present time adequate childcare is largely unavailable. Take, fm in-stance, the highly motivated mother whowants better housing and better healthfor her family. She cannot provide It be-cause there is no safe place she canleave her child and have the child prop-erly cared for. We want somebody toprovide for that care. If the States thinkthey can provide it, that is good; but ifthey do not wish to, at least they wouldhave someone to help them, and this willresult in better child care.Furthermore, many States would liketo have the Federal Government takeover all of their welfare programs. Ifthis is to happen some day, it would bebetter to have someone In the Federalhierarchy with experience.Mr. PASTORE. With reference to the10 percent the State puts up if the Cor-poration is created, who spends that 10percent, the Corporation or the State?Mr. LONG. The State pays the ChildCare Corporation. The Corporation thenproceedsto pay whoever they con-tract with to provide child care. Thatcould be a publicly owned corporation,it could be a nonprofit corporation, Itsimply could be a woman who makes herhome available for child care, or it couldbe provided in a facility run directly bythe Corporation.Mr. PASTORE. I realize that but, infact, are we not saying to the States thatthey have to put up 10 percent, but howthat 10 percent will be spent will be de-cided by the corporation that is createdin Washington?Mr. LONG. There Is no requirementwhatever that the State utilize the serv-ices of the Corporation. The State wifibe given 90 percent Federal matchingfor child care, and will have to put up10 percent, but they would not be re-quiredto spend any ofthis moneythrough the Corporation.Mr. PASTORE. They would be on theirown?Mr. LONG. Yes. It Is the same as if anIndividual wanted to build a house withFHA. They are there to help him withfinancing if he would like for them to doit. The same Is true with respect to theservices of the Corporation.Mr. PASTORE. They would still getthe 90 percent?Mr. LONG. Yes; whether or not theyused the Corporation, they would havethe same Federal matching for childcare.But I want to stress that, as essentialas It Is to provide the additional money,It is equally necessary to provide an or-ganization that Is cometent and qual-ified to do the job.I was presented on the floor-today witha letter which Indicated Mr. Elliot Rich- S 21324 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEDecember 29, 1970ardson does not support the committeeamendment. That is something which Icould have been made aware of earlier,since when we discussed this matter inexecutive session, the Department tookthe position that if Congress wants toprovide for child care this way, that isacceptable to HEW.The fact is that now, with tile respon-sibility resting with Mr. Richardson, wecannot get the job done. I certainly thinkwe would do well to put the responsibilitydefinitely on a particular organizationthat is doing nothing but providing childcare. What we are trying to do is toremedy this one big lack, the lack of ade-quate child care for mothers who wantto work.I want to point out that it is not in-tended that the use of the Corporation belimited to people who are receiving we!-fare assistance. It is intended that anymother who is working would have childcare available to her through the Cor-poration, child care which would meetreasonable standards and would be safeand adequate for the children. Instead ofless than 10 percent of the children need-ing child care receiving that care in facil-ities which meets some kind of stand-ards, we would reverse that and try tosee to it that 90 percent, or hopefully100 percent, would have available tothem some kind of child care that wouldbe appropriate and would meet specifiedstandards.Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, will the Sen-ator permit me to direct one questionto him on, I think, a relatively insignifi-cant point, but I think in the colloquywith the Senator from Rhode Island theSenator from Louisiana pointed out that,in his judgment, a woman could makeavailable a home for this type of service.I notice on page 432, in subsection (13),it says \"other than home child care fa-cilities.\" Is that inconsistent with theanswer of the Senator from Louisianaor is that in another part of the bill?Mr. LONG. That provision only saysthat if something is to be built, construc-tion money would not be spent remodel-ing somebody's home.Mr. BAYH. One of the basic problemsis that there are too many hellholes inthe basement with perhaps some \"wino\"serving as the principal jailer during thedaytime while a number of welfare moth-ers are out working. I am certain this isthe type of thing the Senator fromLouisiana wants to keep from happening.Mr. LONG. Let me satisfy the Senatoron that, if I can. All this provision saysis that if the Federal Child Care Cor-poration is going to spend its construc-tion money to build facilities, it will notspend that money just remodeling some-body's private home.There could be a situation where daycare in a private home would be adequate,However, I invite the Senator to care-fully scrutinize the provisions of the billthat describe the space that must bemade available and also the fire stand-ards that must be met, and the space,outside as well as inside, that must beprovided.The Senator will see that while thesemay not be as high standards as somewould advocate\u2014and they could be up-graded later\u2014at the same time thesestandards will provide for adequate childcare.The facilities would have to meet theLife Safety Code of the National FireProtection Association. At the presenttime in ghetto areas, as well as elsewhere,facilities for child care often cannot befound. Yet there are good, solid churchbuildings, where Sunday school for chil-dren is conducted. There are gymna-siums, and other places, which may besatisfactory. We say that if those meetthe safety standards we would expect ofa public building, why should they notmeet the standards for a child-care cen-ter? This feature of the committee billwas an attempt to get around archaicbuilding codes which hamper efforts toexpand child-care services.We say that, as a Federal standard, ifthe facility meets the life safety codeof the National Fire Protection Associa-tion, it is safe enough for a child-carecenter.Mr. BAYH, I thank the Senator fromLouisiana.In the time I have had available dur-ing the past few days, I have tried toscrutinize the provisions of his measure.There are many things about it that,frankly, recommend themselves to theSenator from Indiana. That is why fromthe beginning I have tried to complimentthe Senator for his interest and concern.I think one of the positive contribu-tions relating to what has just now beendescribed is with respect to the problemof standards. We find at one end a totallack of standards, horrible, utterly inde-scribable,of conditions that 'exist in some areas. The Senator from Louisianadeals with that. At least, I think the pro-visions of the bill begin to deal with it.On the other hand, for one reason orother, there have been zoning or otherstandards that really are exclusive as farasconstruction and maintenance of reasonable facilities are concerned.I think we need to recognize that oneof the basic problems we have today, asfar as child care is concerned, is not thatwe have insensitive, unqualified bureau-crats or political spoilers at the top ofthe system. I have yet to hear one wordin derogation directed at the qualifica-tions of the present director of the Officeof Child Development. This man is ex-tiemely qualified.Therefore I do not think it is neces-sary to set up a competing organization,whether we call it corporation or any-thing else, but rather maximize the ca-pacity that we do have of the people ingovernment concerned with child care.We have them fettered with regulations,and, most specifically, we have them fet-tered with lack of adequate funds. I donot care whether it is on the farm or insuburbia, if we provide adequate fund-ing, the parents of a given communityare going to provide adequate child carefor their children.We had the opportunity of discussingthis with some of the officials of West80th Street Day Care Center of NewYork City, which is a classic example ofa community-controlled child care cen-ter. So this can be done if we provide theresources.I am concerned that by setting up acompeting corporation, we are creatingconflicting programs and dissipating alltoo limited resources.As I said earlier, I think the Senatorfrom Louisiana is to be complimentedfor the flexibility he brings to this pro-gram. His thoughtful efforts and partsof this bill could be exactly what weneed.But let us give this the real, extensiveinvestigation it merits, and come up witha comprehensive program to deal withall of the intricate aspects of adequatechild development, not just adequate cus-todial care.I point out that although the Senatorfrom Louisiana points to his frustrationas far as the JOBS program is concerned,and the Senator from Indiana shares hisfrustration, I think we can make a dif-ferent case than if we are talking aboutjob related child care programs only. Ifwe are talking about the political musclein this country, development of publicopinion that can be harnessed to supporta child development program in a JOBStype program such as that vetoed by thePresident, the only people who are reallyaffected are the unemployed or the un-employable. That is not a very viable po-litical lobby and bloc. But if we are talk-ing about a child development programavailable to all children in this country,I suggest that whether it is the Presi-dent, a Senator, or a State legislator,that type of interest group throughoutthis country is all inclusive, is a verybroad political bloc, and would perhapsconvince the President that it would beunwise to veto legislation designed todeal with this significant problem.I hope, Mr. President, with all due re-spect to the Senator from Louisiana, thatwe can support the amendment of theSenator from Oklahoma and the Senatorfrom New York, not at all as inconsider-ate opposition to the Senator from Lou-isiana, but as a recognition of the factthat this is an, insufficiently studied, yetwell-intentioned effort to deal with avery complicated long-range problem.We should come back here next year,have a full set of hearings, study all thenuances of the problem, and with the ad-vice, counsel, and help of the y,ery pres-tigious and helpful Senator from Louisi-ana, come to this floor with a compre-hensive program that, once and for all,considers all children in this country asindividuals, not as poor children or mid-dle income children, but as children. Inmy judgment, if we provide the compre-hensive program that is necessary, wewill do more to deal with the complicatedproblems that confront our society thanby anything else the Senator from Indi-ana is aware of.In closing, I am reminded of a quotefrom a television preview of the recentWhite House Conference on Children inwhich I was pleased to attend and par-ticipate:Children are above all individuals whohave a claim on the future, a right to exist.They must know they belong to a societythat cherishes that existence.Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I regretthat I have been unable to attend uponthe Senate until now, but I wish to state December 29,1970forthe RECORD the fact that I had alongstanding engagement to do a tele-vision tape in New York, and I made theround trip notwithstanding that I lefthere at almost 2 a.m, this morning, andhave since been discussing with my col-leagues in the Republican conferencewhat ought to be our position on thismatter.Mr. President, I am able to say au-thoritatively\u2014and a copy of the letteris on every Senator's desk\u2014that the Sec-retary of Health, Education, and Wel-fare believes that this particular provi-sion should be stricken from this bill. Iask unanimous consent that the letterfrom Secretary Elliot Richardson to thatefrect' be printed in the RECORD at thispoint.There being no objection, the letterwas ordered to be printed in the RECORD,as follows:THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH,EDUCATION, AND WELFARE,Washington, D.C. Hon. JAVITS,U.S. Senate,Washington, D.C.Dzaa SENATOR JAvI'rS:I very much ap-preciate your inquiry as to the views of thisDepartment regarding the amendment youhave CO-sponsored with Senator Harris tostrike Title XXI authority in HR 17550 toestablish a Federal Child Care Corporation.This title Is, as you know, almost identicalto S. 4101 which was introduced by Sen-ator Long on July 20, 1970.The Administration, as you well know, iscommitted to Improving the quality of lifefor children in the United States, especial-ly the vitally important first five years dur-ing which so much of a Child's cognitive abil-ities is developed. To consolidate the effortwithin the Department, the President hasestablished the 0111cc of Child Developmentand appointed Dr. Edward Zigler, formerlya professor at Yale University, as its Di-rector.The Administration agrees with the pur-poses of this amendment, but does not fa-vor enactment of thistitle at this time.We think that insufficient time has passedto enable OCD and the other offices withwhich It works to prove their worth andeffectiveness before a new government cor-porationIs formed to meet the needs ofthe nation for child care services. We alsocall attention to the very important childcare component of the Family AssistancePlan which will receive early considerationby the 92d Congress. We do not believe thatthis corporation would be the most effectiveway to handle that program when it be-comes law.It would create a new unit in the Execu-tive Branch, independent of the other De-partments and agencies, with branch officesin each major urban area and other areasas deemed necessary. To the extent that thecorporation would conetitute a mechanismfor bringing the fee-paying non-poor fam-ily together with a private child care facility.there arises the real question of whetherthe cost of the administrative overhead forsuch service is necessarg or desirable.To the extent that it would bring the childin receipt of services under another Federalpregram in contact with a child care facility,the question arises of whether it is necessaryto have this separate and additional ma-chinery to accomplish that purpose. In sum-mary, the establishment of an independentcorporation to provide child care Services ap-pears to be unnecessarily duplicative andcostly.Related to this problem of the independentnew agency is another basic point. At thepresent time, there is lodged within the De-partment of Health, Education, and Welfare.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014SENATEextensive responsibility for child develop-ment and child care. To assure coordinationbetween all the Federal sources of day carefunding, and to assure access to the technicalexpertise of the Department in this area, aswell as related services, such as health andeducaiton, any new authority for the devel-opment and provision of child care servicesshould, in our opinion, be lodged in our De-partment.We are also aware of other day care-childdevelopment legislation which has been in-troduced by you and others in both the Houseand Senate. The Administration is currentlystudying these proposals and thinks thatmore complete hearings and study are neces-sary before the Congress enacts the FederalChild Care Corporation or other related leg-islation.We appreciate your cooperation and lookforward to continuing to work closely withyou in the future.With best wishes for a happy holiday sea-son, I remain.Sincerely,ELLIOT L. RICHARDSON,Secretary.Mr. JAVITS. The key sentence, Mr.President, with respect to this matter, isthe following:The Administration agrees with the pur-pose of this amendment, but does not favorenactment of this title at this time. We thinkthat insufficient time has passed to enableOCD and the other offices with which it worksto prove their worth and effectivenesss be-fore a new government corporation is formedto meet the needs of the nation for childcare services. We also call attention to thevery important child care component of theFamily Assistance Plan which will receiveearly consideration by the 92d Congress. Wedo not believe that this corporation wouldbe the most effective way to handle that pro-gram when it becomes law.Mr. President, to summarize my views:First, I agree with the Secretary ofHealth, Education, and Welfare that we should not abort the child care provi-sions of the family assistance plan, whichwe have not even considered, before weconsider it, by prejudging what shall bethe administrative apparatus that will beused for the purpose.Second, Mr. President, we are askedby the sponsors of the proposed FederalChild Care Corporation to come to a conclusion which I think would be mostprejudicial to our further considerationof that matter, and that is to centralizeFederal responsibility in this Corpora-tion.I point out the fact that that is exactlywhat is contemplated, because, in thecommittee report, at page 335, we havethe following statement justifying thisparticular Corporation:It is the committee's view that we need a new mechanism In facing this problem, asingle organization which has both the re-sponsibility and the capability of meetingthis Nation's child care l1eeds. It must bean organization which has the welfare offamilies and children at the forefront, anorganization which, though national in scopewill be able to respond to individual needsand desires on the local level. It must bean organization which will be able both tomake use of the child care resources whichnow exist and to promote the creation ofnew resources. It must be able to utilize theeffortsofgovernmentalagencies,private voluntary organizations, and private enter-'prise.The new Federal Child Care Corporation,which would be created under the committeebill is intended to be Such an organization.S 21325Now. Mr. President, if ever I saw anexample of putting the cart before thehorse. It is in that situation. We are askedto legislate a fixed form of organization,with specific capital, specific authority,and specific criteria for its operation, be-fore we have even decded what shouldbe the fundamental objective which wewish to achieve with respect to child carein this country.There are four basic alternatives, andthis corporation pl'oposal would have uschoose one now, even before we decidewhat shall be our basic plan that we wishto carry out.The other alternatives are as follows:First, a State plan with Federal ad-ministration, That is, incidentally, con-templated by a very exhaustive bill in-troduced in the House of Representativesby Representative BRADEMAS with thespolisorship of a number of Members.That is known as Comprehensive Pre-school Education and Child Day Care Actof 1969.Second, there is a State plan withState administration, and that is theplan contemplated by a measure in-troduced, again in the other body, byRepresentative DELLENBACK of Minne-sota, and, in this body by the Senatorfrom Vermont (Mr. PROUTY).Finally, Mr. President, there are vari-ous aspectsofthe community plan,which really is based upon working fromthe grass roots upward, and that plan iscontained in my own bill, which I in-troduced just about a month ago. It isalso contained in the bill of the distin-guished present occupant of the chair(Mr. MONDALE) his bill being known asthe Head Start Child Development Actof 1969, and the bill introduced by theSenator fromIndiana(Mr.BAYH), known as the Universal Child Care andDevelopment Act of 1971.So there are four basic plans: coinmu-nity, State plan with Federal adminis-tration, State plan with State adminis-tration, and the Federal Child Care Cor-poration, the plan of Senator LONG.We also ought to take a look at theordersofmagnitudehere.Senator LONG'S corporation, which he says wouldbe a single organization with both theresponsibility and the capability of meet-mg this Nation's child care needs\u2014thissingle organization, supposedly, to dealwith all the needs for child care, is tohave a $50 million capital, and, when itgets rolling, it is to have the ability orthe authority to issue $250 million in i'ev\u2014enuebonds,not guaranteed by theUnited States but dependent for theirvalidity as bonds upon income whichwould be earned by day care centers andthat is all.Mr. President, juxtapose those finan-cial vertebras to the need and to theactuality. Right now, we are spendingin round figures about $450 million a yearfor day care. And, Mr. President, underany of these bills one may choose, andeven the contemplation of the adminis-tration itself, faces a very material in-crease. We all hope that much of thatwill be self-financing, but nevertheless,we are dealing with an order of magni-tude which make the financial base ofthis corporation either completely- In-adequate to the purpose to be served, or S 21326 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEDecember 29, 1970an effort to so materially reduce thewhole size of the day care operation inthe country as to absolutely defeat anyplan\u2014such as one which ties in the daycare to a very critical reform of welfareor the White House Conference's plan orany of our plans in Congress\u2014all ofthem are much broader in scope thanwould be contemplated by this corpora-tion. So all this corporation would dois try to fit a big foot into a very smallshoe. When that is added to the factthat it would abort our consideration ofthe President's family assistance planand that it would commit us to onecourse of administration when we havean aggregate of four before we evenknow what our plan is going to be aboutchild care, it seems to me to be highlyimprovident.Mr. PERCY. Mr. President, will theSenator yield?Mr. JAVITS. I yield.Mr. PERCY. Before making a com-ment on the motion to strike, I shouldlike to repeat what I said to the SenateFinance Committee when I testified be-fore that committee on behalf of day-care centers and certain proposed legis-lation that I had introduced to providefor their construction.I believe that the Senator from Louisi-ana (Mr. LONG), the chairman of thecommittee, is devoted to finding an an-swer to the day-care problem, and Icommend him for his initiative. I intendto keep a deep and a continuing inter-estin methods of solving the problem ofchild care. I believe it is one of the mostcritical problems we are going to have toface in the near future. However, despitethis interest and despite the fact thatI have introduced a measure in this areaas it relates to the President's family as-sistance plan, I wish to support the mo-tiontostrikethissection from thepending bill.Mr. President, my prime reason foradopting this position lies in the factthat I believe that the proposal con-tained in the bill has resulted from lessconsideration than the problem deserves.The committee included the proposal inthe bill without benefit of the recom-mendations of the White House Confer-ence on Children and, in fact, withoutbenefit of any specific hearings whatso-ever.As a result, there was no opportunityto explore the proposals on this subjectmade by other Senators, including thoseof the distinguished Senator from NewYork (Mr. JAvIT5), who has given a tre-mendous amount of attention to thisfield and Is extremely knowledgeable inIt.Ibelievehisproposedlegislation should be given every possible considera-tion, because my own initial reaction toit is that it is a basic thrust in the rightdirection and goes to the heart of theproblem. Also, as has been mentioned,the Senator from Minnesota (Mr. MON-DALE)and the Senator from Indiana(Mr. BATh) have made proposals thathave not been considered thoroughly.There was no opportunity to considerthe question of how deeply an individualcommunity should be involved in plan-ning to meet the community's child careneeds. There was no real opportunity toadequately consider the adequacy of thestructure of the Corporation, includingthe relationship between the Corporationand the Office of Child Development andtheOfficeof Economic Opportunity.Finally, there was no opportunity to con-sider the adequacy of the level of author-ization contained in the bill.I should like to ask the distinguishedSenator from New York, from his vastexperience in establishing enterprises ofthis type, whether, rather than comingfrom the top down, projects involving thepeople, a community do not come outbetter when they come from the com-munity up.Mr. JAVITS. There isno questionabout that. I should like to make twopoints in that regard.One is that we are not even arguingfor that. We are saying, yes, we feelthat projects should come from theground up. We are not asking the Sen-ate to accept that now. But we are alsoasking the Senate not to foreclose it bytaking a project which proceeds from thetop down.I should like to ask the Senator thisquestion, because he has the city ofChicago in his State, and the Senatorknows I have New York: What does theSenator think will be the reception ofthe Federal Child Care Corporation whenit comes into one of the Chicago ghettosto set up day care centers? Are we goingto have a new set of militants who aregoing to ride them out on a rail or throwthem out or picket their projects or re-fuse to participate in them or burn themdown, or are we going to do somethingconstructive in day care?Mr. PERCY. I think we would be illadvised to go ahead and establish thiscorporation until we actually know morethan we do now. I really cannot tell theSenator what the reaction of the leader-ship of the various ghetto areas in Chi-cago would be. I would feel much betterif they had been able to come down andtestify, the leadership, for instance, of acommunity of some million blacks, whoreally have a deep concern about thisproblem, and the leadership of other con-cerned communities, and have them feelthat they have had a voice in the makingof this vital legislation.It is better that these programs comefrom the community up and give resi-dents a sense of participation, ratherthan justestablisha superstructuresetup from Washington, have a corpora-tion established, without the benefit thatwe could gain from participation in whatshould be adequate hearings. I wouldtend to think that we should have thesehearings as early as possible next year. Itought to be one of the earliest orders ofbusiness, and it fits together well withthe early consideration that has beenpromised on the family assistance plan.Mr. JAVITS. I thoroughly agree withthe Senator.I am not trying to prejudge it, either.I have an idea. I prefer the communityapproach, but there may be many bugsin that. Hence, I think the only fair wayto do it is to start with an effort to de-sign really a child care program. We mayvery well end up with the idea of a cor-poration. But to abort all our considera-tions by opting for that now seems to meto be most Improvident and ill advised.I point out to the Senator that it is notless than absolutely obliterating all otherideas because the committee itself saysthat this is the single organization thatis going to have the job of meeting ofthe Nation's child care needs in its hands.For example, on page 420:The corporation shall have the responsi-bility and authority to meet th\u00e7 Nation'sneeds for adequate child care services.Mr. President, that may have the re-sponsibility and authority, but they arenot going to have the resources or the or-ganization. So it seems to me to be a mostimprovident provision,I do not think one need plead for mybill, which I like very much and manyother people do, or for that of SenatorsMONDALE and BAYH, or PROUTY and Rep-resentatives BRADEMAS, DELLENBACK, andQuIE. One need not plead for any ofthose. All one has to do is to give them achance to dl'aw the breath of life, ratherthan to extinguish them now in this im-provident way, before we are remotelyready.I might say to the Senator from Illi-nois that it bears out what Senator HAR-RIS knew and what all of us knew\u2014thatwe let this survive in the bill though it isof exactly the same gender as what weeliminated\u2014trade and, to the dismay ofmany of us, the President's FAP\u2014be-cause we were just up against it. Herewe are with the same kind of proposition,which we are asked to swallow the verymoment that we have rejected a numberof others of exactly the same kind be-cause we just cannot give them the con-sideration we know they should have. Icannot think of legislating more impro-vidently than doing this.As we all know from the colloquieswhich ensued when we considered themotion to recommit, this was somethingthe chairman, Senator LONG, insisted on.We all respect him, and he certainlyhelped us to cut the Gordian knot on thisbill. So we stood aside and are now ar-guing the same provision we should haveargued on the motion to recommit.I should like to add one other thing:The chairman remains the chairman ofthe Finance Committee; he will be thechairman of the Finance Committee nextyear. It seems to me that there is no in-security in his position. He will be justas strolig and just as effective and justas able to have his prestige count withhis colleagues for the Federal Child CareCorporation next year as this year. SoI do not think there is any derogation ofthe respect we owe to the chairman ofthe committee that is bringing out a bill.On the contrary, I think it would be in-consistent if we did not do our best tomake tile provision\u2014if it is going to bethe final choice of the Senate\u2014at leastbe the best possible, after a considera-tion of alternatives, and after\u2014as Sena-tor PERCY has said\u2014the opportunity forhundreds of thousands or millions ofblacks who are very deeply involved, andthe poor generally, o testifyfor or against this proposition, so that we willhave some idea as to whether or not itwill work.Again I point out to Senators that forthe same reasons we are discussing, theSecretary of Health, Education, and Wel-fare agrees that this Is Ill advised and December 29, 1970wants very much to see it stricken fromthe bill.Mr. PERCY. Mr. President, there isone further point I might make lest weleave the impression, In striking this par-ticular section of the bill, we are sayingthat we are doing nothing about daycare problems at this time.There are certain provisions in the billnow which are unaffected by this motionto strike which will serve as temporarymeasures to deal with the problem untilwe can adequately explore the implica-tions of the Child Care Corporation.One of the major reasons for the fail-ure of the work incentive program hasbeen the absence of adequate day carefacilities. The bill provides a temporarysolution to this problem by increasingFederal participation in the financing ofday care facilities from 75 to 90 percent.While this will not solve the problem, Ibelieve that It will alleviate some aspectsof the situation until, early in the nextCongress, we have had an opportunity toadopt a comprehensive solution.Thus, Mr. President, I shall vote forthe amendment to strike. I hope that amajority of my colleagues will do so aswell. I do so despite the urgency of thesituation and despite my own deep in-terest and commitment to providing ade-quately for day care facilities. I do so,because I believe that in the long run,we shall make a better contribution tothe solution of this most critical prob-lem.I share with many of my colleaguesthe feeling that some of the nongermanethings we have stricken out of the socialsecurity bill the country will be betterfor. It would have been an utter disaster,for Instance, for this country to havepushed ahead just for the sake of legis-lating and adopted a trade bill that wouldhave set the country back 40 years in itspolicies.There is the kernel of a good idea here,but we are not ready now to see it nur-tured and come to growth until morework can be done on it. That work canbe done In the 92d Congress.I congratulate again and commend mycolleague from New York for his dis-tinguished leadership In this field andthe expertise he brings to It. I know heoffers this amendment In the belief thatIf the bill passes In Its present form, thecountry will feel that we have solved theclay care problem and that we have reallythought through the answers, when wehave not done so carefully enough.Successful action on this motion tostrike, I think, will give us the oppor-tunity, early next year, to pursue thiswith the deliberate care It requires. Thatdoes not mean undue delay. It meansthat we can have action quickly, once wehave full hearings.Mr. JAVITS. I thank my colleaguefrom fllinoi8 very much. He has beenmost helpful.Mr. COOK. Mr. President, will, the Senator from Illinois kindly stay herefor a moment? I should like to ask aquestion, if this Is the kernel of a goodIdea, let us talk about financing It for aminute.On page 434 of the bIll, It st.ate8 thatthe Corporation will receive $50 million,CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEand starting in 1975 they must pay itback at the i'ate of $2 million a year.This is $2 million a year out of its reve-nues from day care centers. However,to borrow the $250 million from the pub-lic, it says on page 436 of the bill:Any such bonds may be secured by assetsof the Corporation, including, but not limitedto, fees, rentals, or other charges which theCorporation receives for the use of any facil-ity for child care which the Corporation hasan interest.In order to borrow the $250 million,what kind of assets is it going to be ableto build in the meantime?It has a $50 million debt which it hasto start paying back in 1975 at the rateof $2 million a year. It cannot borrow$250 million. It has to have $250 millionworth of assets or more.How is it ever really going to be able toaccomplish that?Mr. JAVITS. I would say, looking at itfrom the point of view of the chairmanof the Finance Committee, that theywould immediately have to go into theday care business for the relatively up-per level, upper middle income families,in order to make the program viablefinancially. So,all our purposes herewould be defeated at one fell swoop, be-cause we are setting conditions whichobviously they cannot meet, and stillserve the clientele we'want them to serve.Mr. COOK. I thank the Senator.Mr. JAVITS. I thank my colleaguefrom Kentucky.Mr. MONDALE. Mr. President, will theSenator from New York yield?Mr. JAVITS. I yield.Mr. MONDALE. The comments justmade by the Senator from Kentucky arevery useful. I had not realized what hestated. We have had hearings before theEmployment, Manpower, and PovertySubcommltee on this proposal, which Iintroduced along with about 20 others,which we call the Headstart ChildhoodAct of 1969. We heard from a number ofnationallyrecognized early childhoodspecialists In the country. I am pleased tosay that the President was wise In ap-pointing one of our witnesses, Dr. Zigler,as the Director of the Office of Child De-velopment. Dr. Zigler Is recognized as oneof the best experts In the field.I came away from the hearings ap-palled by the way we treat our preschoolchildren. I felt increasing concern thatas the Nation moves in the direction ofdealing with the problems of the first5 years of life, particularly for the mostdisadvantaged, we make sure that we doso In the right way. A child\u2014especiallya young child\u2014Is a sensitive and highlydestructible entity.Middle-classAmericanparentsdo everything they can for their children,with decent housing, the best nutritionand health assistance in the world, withall the love and affection they can pro-vide, and when It Is all over they hopeand pray that, somehow, their childrenwill make It. But, under this proposal,we would take a different approach.When a child initsearly formativeyears, the emphasis Is on letting themother out of the house to work, In theinterim we take the child\u2014like a com-modity\u2014and stack him like cordwood InS 21327some day-care center. To be sure, theday-care center is supposed to achievecertain physical minimums. It it sup- posed to be fireproof. It is supposed to bewarm. It is supposed to be clear and if thechildren are fed, it is supposed to be nu-tritious, and so forth. But nowhere in theproposal, in my opinion, is there anysensitivity shown toward the emotionalor psychological problems which everydecent parent knows is essential to therearing of a healthy child.Ifthis Nation launches a programaimed toward letting mothers work andin the process simply salts thousandsand thousands of children away in thesecold and sterile custodial centers, I thinkwe will be producing a generation ofemotionally crippled children that willcause more trouble than anything wehave seen in the past. I think we willregret having taken this well-motivatedbut, in my opinion, yet-to-be-perfectedproposal.In my opinion, the country is quicklycoming to the conclusion that we needquality, healthy childhood programs forour children. It is the most exciting newtheory for dealing with disadvantaged inAmerica. In my opinion, most childrenwho grow up in tragically disadvantagedcircumstances are ruined by the timethey even go to the first grade. Theyneed sensitiVe child' development efforts.But I think we should do it right. I donot believe this does do it right. I thinkthe theory is wrong. I believe it can domore harm than good, I hope we willstrike it and that the next Congress willreally take hold of the issue and pass thekind of proposal that gives quality, total,child development assistance to the hun-dreds and thousands of disadvantagedchildren in this country who so desper-ately need it.Mr. JAVITS. The Senator is 100-per-cent correct. I should like to point outthe kind of services that can be pro-vided\u2014which is contained in section 2118of this particular provision, on page 442and on later pages. What the Senator isreally talking about Is custodial care.Mr. MONDALE. The Senator is cor-rect.Mr. JAVITS. It is not developmentalcare, and that is one of the biggest issuesin this field. Obviously when we are deal-ing with this Corporation, and consider-ing its restrictions, we see what musthappen.The Corporation cannot even earn In-terest on the bonds, as the Senator fromKentucky (Mr. COOK) pointed out. TheSenator from Kentucky poInted out tome privately\u2014and I would like to saypublicly\u2014that the only Investment itcould make It In Government securities.It canont even buy high Interest bonds.It Is confined to U.S. bonds.It Is this money and money earnedfrom day-care centers that will give themearnings and enable them to pay backthe basic investment of $50 million, at$2 million a year. This Is not even aGovernment bond.The whole thing becomes a busInessoperation other than the kind we want.As always happens in debates of thischaracter, It Is unnecessary to extend theargument that far. The fact is that In S 21328 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEDecember 29, 1970this case what we are arguing for Is thatwe withhold our action, rather than thatwe take action.While we speak with admiration andrespect for the idea\u2014because I am de-voted myself to original ideas\u2014and thisis an original idea\u2014I certainly am notdevoted to such ideas until after theyhave been tested out in some fashion,even if it is only in thbate.We should deal with the bugs in theprogram, some ofwhich have beenpointed out in the debate today, espe-cially when we will be aborting anotherapproach to the same problem.ThePRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CASE). Will the Senator suspend? Thereare conversations going on all over theChamber.The Senator may proceed.Mr. JAVITS. Mr. Presidont, I havenamed four purposes. I would like to l'e-capitulate them.First, there is the community approach,which we are following now in our ap-propriations for the OEO, used for childcare. That Is the Office of Economic Op-portunity. There is also the approach ofState plans with Federal administra-tion, the approach of State plans withState administration, and, finally, thefourth alternative, the Federal ChildCare Corporation.Mr. President, I would like to concludemy observations on this matter by againreferring to the opposition to thi3 par-ticular plan at this time. All the Secre-tary of Health, Education, and WelfareIndicates Is not that he wishes t knock it down, but that he feels that we wouldbe preempting the field at a time whenthe field should not be preempted.Mr. President, I would like again toread a statement from the letter that Iread before. Many of the Scnators werenot here at the time I did this before.The key portion In the Secretary'sletter which was received this morningreads as follows:The Administration agrees with the pur-poses of this amendment, but dces not favorenactment of this title at this time. Wethink that insufficient time has passed to enableOCDandthe other offices with which it worksto prove their worth and effectiveness beforea new government corporation is formed tomeet the needs of the nation for child careservices. We also call attention to the veryimportant childcarec.mponentofthe Family Assistance Plan which will receiveearly consideration by the 92d Congress. Wedo not believe that this corporation wouldbe the most effective way to handle thatprogram when it becomes law.That is the case as I see it for theamendment. I hope very much that theSenate will agree to the amendment andfor the present\u2014that isall we ask\u2014strike this particular title from the bill.tJNANIMOUS'CONSENT AGREEMENTMr. LONG. Mr. President, I would liketo ask If we might agree to a limitationon debate so that we could vote at sometime certain on this amendment.I ask unanimous consent that theSenate vote on this matter in 20 mInutes,the time to be equally divided betweenthe opponents and the proponents of theamendment.Mr. HARRIS. That is satisfactory withme.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is thereobjection to the request of the Senatorfrom Louisiana? The Chair hears noneand it is so ordered.Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, I ask forthe yeas and nays.The yeas and nays were ordered.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, I ask unan-imous consent that there be a briefquorum call and that the time be takenequally from both sides.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is thereobjection? The Chair hears none and itis so ordered. The clerk will call the roll.The assistant legislative clerk pro-ceeded to call the roll.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, I ask unan-Imous consent that the order for thequorum call be rescinded.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Withoutobjection, it is so ordered.Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, I yieldmyself 2 minutes.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Oklahoma is recognized for 2minutes.Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Presid9nt, mentionwas made earlier in the debate concern-ing the' position of the National Associa-tion for Black Child Development andthe lack of approval by that organizationof this child care provision as it is pres-ently written.I have here a position paper on theFederal Child Care Corporation provi-sion prepared by the National Associa-tion for Black Child Development. Iask unanimous consent that it be printedat this point In the RECORD.There being no obJection, the paperwas ordered to be prizted in the RECORD,as 4101\u2014AN AMENDMENT TOTHE FAMILY ASSISTANCE PLANWhile the basic purposes of the bill arevalid, there are a number of significant ob-jections which make it impossible for theNational Association for Black Child De-velopment to support it:THE STRUCTURESec. 2002 (a) The creation of a nationallylodged vehicle is a logical step in attemptingto provide comprehensive child care in thisnation. However, such a mechanism mustbe designed within the context of the recip-lents for the proposed child care services,Since Senator Long's Act is to be an Amend-ment to the Family Assistance Act. ChildCare Provision Section. the initial child careservices offered by the proposed Corpora-tion will be aimed at the Black and poorcitizenry of this nation. This is clearly statedin Sec. 2003(c) ... TheCorporation shallaccord first priority to the needs for childcare services of families on behalf of whomchild care services will be paid in whole orin part from funds appropriated to carry outTitle IV...Thishas strong implicationsfor controlling contracts under FAP.Our position on the kind of mechanism weview as being most beneficial has been statedin a position statement entitled OptimumConditionsforMinorityInvolvementin Quality Child Development Programming,p. 12, Sec. 4(a) ... TheFederal governmentshould administer funds for day care proj-ects with minimal state involvement. Provid-ing the Office of Child Development can besensitized to minority concerns, It should bethe administrative agency. Provisions mustbe made for technical assistance to commu-nities preferably by minority firms in advanceof actual funding.The Corporate structure described in theFederal Child Care Corporation Act is similarin many ways to existing agencies which arecontrolled by persons appointed outside ofthe Black community. Such persons set pol-icy and develop programs for the Black com-munity residents. This model has a poor trackrecord. The act advocates a proposed mo-nopoly for child care services.The proposed Corporation is basically a compromise child care plan modeled afterlarge profit-making corporations. The Corpo-ration will monitor itself, establish its owncodes,standardsandregulations,These standards will bypass and supersede fed-eral, state, regional and local requirementsas outlined in Sec. 2006 \"Exclusiveness ofFederal Standards.\" This section should bereviewed in terms of ratios of adults to chil-dren as outlined in \"Standards for ChildCare,\" Section 2004(b),(1),(A),(B)in order to assess Itsimplications. Whereas,optimum ratio (Child-Adult) suggested is 8to 1, the Corporate Board can authorize a 25to I ratio which clearly speaks to custodialcare. Further, such a ratio is very similar tothose that have been proposed by Franchiserswhose aim is profit-making, and promotescustodial care, instead of quality child careand child development.The Corporation as presently being pro-posed. is monopoly focusing on child careneeds In this country. It will receive its initialfunding because of the Family Assistance Actwhich is designed for the poo. As it is pres-ently set forth, the Federal Child Care Cor-poration Act will preclude self-determina-tion and the fundamental rights of Black,poor and minority groups to adequately par-ticipate in making policy and plans as theydetermine their child care needs.THE BOARDBasically the Board is oomposed of thosewho will represent the current administra-tion. If persons on the Board do not complythey will undoubtedly be removed by thePresident. All powers rests with this Board.They will appoint the Advisory Council. Theywill appoint personnel, They are empoweredto collect fees directly or through contrac-tual arrangements. It becomes apparent thatthe Board will probably have subsidiaries\u2014which again speaks to contracting with na-tional franchisers.FUNDINGThe proposed Act calls for a RevolvingFund, Sec. 2003(a) which will be establishedby the Treasury. The amount proposed. 50million dollars. will be paid back In annualInstallments of 2 million dollars. The Cor-poration will pay interest on this loan, on thebasis of a rate equal to the average rate ofthe Treasury's loan. If the Corporate fundsare in excess, the Corporation will investmoney in various ventures related to childcare. In other words, they will plow profitback into the Corporation to create subOrdi-aries in other program and service areas inchild care.This funding process, as called for In Sen-ator Long's Act.initlally takes tax monies toloan the Corporation. Further, this Corpora-tion will issue Bonds, which the governmentwill not be responsible for, which are soid tothe people, similar to war bonds, costing thetaxpayer the cost of the loan and capital forit to operate autonomously. Thus, the Cor-poration will be selling services for operatingcosts.This Bill as proposed is basically a thrusttoward selling the concept of developing so-cial services as a private sector function, andremoving the responsibility from the govern-ment in this area, Most appalling is theprofit-making dimension which is being in!-tiated on the backs of the poor and Blackpeople in this country, by attaching this Actto the Family Assistance Act. December 29, 1970Components of the bill that are objection-able:(1) Lack of appropriate representation onthe Corporate Board and Advisory Councilof Black and other minority people;(2) Lack of assurance of quality programsvia a vis the proposed ratios as outlined inthe Act;(3) Lack of a certification process for in-dividuals who have demonstrated ability inthe care of children in the various proposedchild care programs;(4) Lack of an objective evaluation proc-ess of the proposed Corporate Board. TheAct does not reflect a process of account-ability, as exemplified in the revolving fundconcept; and the reporting procedure toCongress every two years. It appears that theAdvisory Council who have been appointedby the Corporate Board will be the evalua-tive mechanism. This suggests a self-evalua-tion process, to which we are opposed;(5) Black and minority group firms willfind It difficult to receive contracts for pro-viding Technical Assistance to the child careprograms because of the growing competi-tion by big business and franchisers in thisarea; and(6) The possibility that the proposed Cor-poration will perpetuate custodial programsis glowing due to the lack of specific pro-gram criteria. There is no mentioning In thepresent Act of the ages of children and thedifferent 'ratios of adults in relationship tothis factor.Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, referencewas also made earlier to .,he Child Wel-fare League. I have here comments onthe Federal Child Care Corporation pro-visions prepared by the Child WelfareLeague. I call attention to excerpts fromthose comments in which it was said,for example:In fact, the many implications of S. 4101are so far reaching and of such importancethat we believe there needs to be a verycareful examination and analysis of the im-pact of the bill's provisions by this Commit-tee and by a wide variety of Government andpublicwitnesses.Assessment ofS.4101, alone, might well require many weeks. Be-cause of the press of business already beforethis Committee, we respectfully suggest thatsubstantive d1scusionofthisimportant legislation take place within the context offull Committee hearings, arranged solely forthis purpose at some later date. The Leaguewould be pleased to assist the Committee inany possible way to prepare for these hear-ings. We offer the Committee the use of ourresources and pledge our cooperation.I certainly support that statement.Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-sent to have printed in the RECORD otherexcerpts from these comments made bythe Child Welfare League.There being no objection, the excerptswere ordered to be printed in the RECORD,as follows:There have been several other -bills intro-duced in both the House and the Senatedealing with various kinds of children's serv-ices, including \"Head Start\" type programs,child development services, early childhoodeducation and day care. A common featurehas been a concern for the children of moth-ers who work or are in training. An exami-nation of these bills, along with 5. 4101,presents several issues to which we believethis Committee should address itself.What types of programs should be author-ized by legislation affecting young children?Can and should the so-called \"day careneeds\" of children be considered separatelyfrom the educational and developmentalneeds, or should these programs be com-bined?CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEAre the programs needed for the childrenof working mothers and guardians essen-tially different from those required for chil-drenfromdisadvantagedandso-called \"culturally-deprived\" families?What are the essential ingredients of anychild care program if it is to provide ade-quately for a child's developmental and edu-cational needs, particularly when the motheris employed and absent from the home?We believe that the Committee shouldconsider the following questions before con-cluding that consolidation in a new, quasi-governmental body such as the Federal ChildCare Corporation is advisable.Is it advisable to give authority over allchild care servicesto any one agency\u2014whether that agency is governmental, likethe Office of Child Development, or quasi-governmental,liketheproposedFederalChild Care Corporation?Is it possible to utilize the administrativeskill and the trained personnel at variouslevels within the government agencies todesignprogramsanddeliverprograms through through an existing governmentagency? -- SeveralCommissions have recommendedfuller utilization of Head Start programs sothat they could also serve as full-time daycare facilities.Isit desirable to have oneagency, such as the relatively new Office ofChild Development, administer thelarge Head Start program, and establish anotherFederal agency to administer all other childcare services?HEW has had virtually no funding tofinance remodeling, or construction of newchild care facilities. Does this factor make itdifficult to assess the Department's abilityto assume the responsibility of meeting theNation's needs for adequate child care serv-ices?What would be the relationship betweenthe Office of Child Development, with itshighly-trained and skilled Director, and theFederal Child Care Corporation?Skilled, capable personnel in the field ofchild development, special work, psychology.and eduoation are in very short supply. Butsome of these scarce and skilled profession-als capable of administering and developingthe standards necessary for suchMi'. COOK. Mr. President, will theSenator yield?Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, I yield 2minutes to the Senator from Kentucky.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Kentucky is recognized.Mr. COOK, Mr. President,I would like to direct these remarks to the dis-tinguished Senator from Louisiana be-cause, for the life o.f me, I cannot figureout how financially this Corporation willbe able to come into existence. If it bor-rows its maximum of $250 million, floatsanon-Government-guaranteed bond, and if they are fortunate enough onthat basis to sell a public bond at 7 per-cent interest the first year alone wouldbe $17.5 million. If they floated the bondsfor 25 years, it is conceivable their firstprincipal payment in the first year wouldbe $10 million, Then they have an auto-matic payback of their $50 million be-ginning in 1975 of $2 million a year.That means that the first year of itsfirst full borrowing capacity, with the$300 million Corporation, as far as its as-sets are concerned, It has to earn overand above its expenses and pay backto the Treasury, and pay interest tobondholders, to the tune of $29.5 million.I am not sure I know of a major privatecorporation in the United States capital-ized at $300 million after all expensesS 21329that could conceivably pay back $29.5million in any one year. I am wonderingfinancially how this Corporation caneven come into existence with the firstpayout load of $29.5 million, If anyonecan answer that question for me, I wouldappreciate it, but it is a matter of figuringinterest on $250 million, plus the prin-cipal payment, plus the fact that start-ing in 1975, they have to pay back $2million on the $50 million of capitaliza-tion..Mr. LONG. Mr. President, we are talk-ing about only $50 million, because theremainder of that money does not be-come available until after 2 years, whenbonds could be issued for constructionpurposes. This Corporation would beginits operations with the $50 million loan.For all services provided it would be paidfees, whether from the parents or fromthe welfare agency.Mr. COOK. Mr. President, will the Sen-ator yield further?Mr. HARRIS. I yield 1 minute to theSenator from Kentucky.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Kentucky Is recognized.Mr. COOK. Is the Senator saying inessence the Federal Government is goingto pay to the Corporation on nonguaran-teed bonds the full extent of the privatemarket interest rather than have themguaranteed by the Federal Government,because you also provide to go on theopen market and sell these at the highestrate, that the funds of the Corporation,and I refer to section (b) on page 433:\"shall not be invested In any obligationor security other than obligations of theUnited States or obligations the prin-cipal and interest on which are guaran-teed by the United States.\"Mr. LONG. Mr. President, I wish tocall to the attention of the Senator thatthe Corporation is not trying to makemoney through investment, This provi-sion simply states that, If they have extramoney, they could invest it in Govern-ment obligations on an Interim basis sothey would be earning money on It.Mr. COOK. Mr. President, will theSenator from Oklahoma yield further?Mr. HARRIS, I yield 1 additional min-ute to the Senator from Kentucky.Mr. COOK. I have listened with a greatdeal of Interest to what the Senator said.If money is borrowed on the open mar-ket, It has to be paid back.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The timeof the Senator has expired. Ies theSenator from Oklahoma yie,ld further?Mr. HARRIS. No; I reserve the re-mainder of my time.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Whoyields time?Mr. LONG. I yield myself 1 minute.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Louisiana is recognized.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, the Corpor-ation initially borrows up to $50 millionfrom the Treasury. That is for initial op-erating capital. But once it is in opera-tion It charges for the services it is pro-viding, and the fees are paid either bythe parents or, if they are needy, by thewelfare agency. After Its first 2 years ofoperation, the Corporation Is authorizedto borrow $50 million annually for up to5 years for construction of facilities. S 21330 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEDecember 29, 1970Here, too, the Corporation will chargefor services provided In the facilities itconstructs.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator's 1 minute has expired.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, I yield my-self 2 additional minutes.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator is recognized for 2 additional min-utes.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, one of thegreat crying needs in this entire childwelfare area is the need for adequatechild care for children of working moth-ers. There are two major problems in-volved. One problem is that the Statesneed fiscal help. We took care of that byliberalizing the matching formula. Noone complains about that. Second weneed to have someone who has the abil-ity and will to provide chi1d care serv-ices. Most State welfare agencies are, ap-parently, not well equipped to do thisnow, and this is evidenccd by the factthey are not now using even half of theFederal funds we have made available.How do we handle this problem? Weset up a Federal Child Care Corporation,start It out with a $50 million loan fromthe Treasury for initial opcrating capital,and then have the Corporation makechild care services to as many mothersas possible who would like to have childcare provided.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sena-tor's time has expired. Does the Senatoryield himself additional time?Mr. LONG. Not at this time.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Whoyields time?Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, I yieldmyself 2 minutes.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Oklahoma is recognized for 2minutes.Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, I askunanimous consent that a memorandumIn supportof this amendment be printedin the RECORD at this time.There being no objection, the niem-orandum was ordered to be printed inthe RECORD, as follows:MEMO IN SUPPORT OF HARRIS-JAVITS-MONDALEAMENDMENT To STRIKE THE FEDERAL CHILDCARE CORPORATION PRovIsioNs FROM HR.175501. There have been inadequate hearings onthis far-reaching piece of legislation and in-sufficient effort to coordinate It with otherFederal programs which touch on day careservices. Many parts of this provision couldbe improved by thoughtful amendment, butthere is simply not time to handle this wholematter at this late date in the session.2.Thewhole question of child care willcome up again anyway early in the next ses-sion in connection with welfarereform. There is no need to rush into this major newprogram right now.3. There is a great need texpand child care services, but two fundamental require-ments should be parental involvement andcommunity control. These requirements arenot properly safeguarded in the provisionsought to be stricken.4. Standards set up by the bill are inade-quate in regard to child-staff ratios, staffqualifications, facility standards (this bill would supersede state and local standards)and, most importantly, in regard to childdevelopment concepts.Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, I yieldthe remainder of my time to the Senatorfrom New York.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from New York is recognized.Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I thinkthe case has been made adequately. Itcomes down to the fact that we areaborting all other plans and opting fora plan that is much too small for thesituation and a plan that is not finan-cially viable. I believe the Senator fromKentucky (Mr. COOK) put his finger onthe problem in noting that a corpora-tion with $300 million to operate, andwith this kind of income from welfareagencies it cannot be financially viable.Hence it will have trouble selling bonds.We will pu ourselves In a box.Let us not abort other plans and im-providently opt for a plan which hasnot been designed or developea to meetthe situation because we will not knowthe plan for child care for the countryuntil we finally deal with FAP.For all those reasons I believe thatthe amendment is an appropriate vehi-cle for the Senate to get out of the situa-tion which we face here, in addition tothe other difficulties we have gotten into.There has been inadequate inquiry Intothis matter and there are many flaws inthe proposal. It aborts the situation longbefore we are ready for it and comingat this time in this session It is most im-provident.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, I yield 5minutes to the Senator from Connect,i-cut.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Connecticut Is recognized.Mr.RIBICOFF.Mr.President, throughout the consideration of this billI have found myself in sharp disagree-ment with the chairman of my commit-tee over certain provisions. But that doesnot mean every position he advances Iswrong. In this Instance the Senator fromLouisiana has a good Idea and it has mysupport.We must realize that in this countrywe have need for day-care facilities forsome 7 million children. We only havefacilities in this country for some 700,-000 children. Consequently, throughoutthis Nation, in small towns and big cities,we are unsuccessful in many of our so-cial programs because there are Insuf-ficient facilities to assist mothers withyoung children.The WIN program, the work incentiveprogram, adopted in the Senate in fiscal1969, appropriated $25 million and hasused only $4million.In 1970, we ap-propriated $52 million and used only $18million.The reason why such small percent-ages were used was due to lack of facili-ties in the United States to take care ofthe children involved. What has beenproposed here is not an exclusive pro-gram; and here is where I think the Sen-ator from Oklahoma and the Senatorfrom New York misread the purpose ofthe particular Corporation sought to bebrought into existence. In the familyatsistance plan, which failed, there wasprovision for some $386 million for daycare. In this bill there is some $250 mil-lion for day care.That does not mean the proposals theSenators from Indiana or New Yorkor Oklahoma have in mind would be immediately put out of existence because ofthe proposal. What the Senator fromLouisiana is saying in this bill is this:We have been unsuccessful over the pastdecades in providing day-care centers.The old methods just are not workingand we must find a mechanism that isright for today, and not a mechanismthat has failed in the past.What we are saying is that the Fed-eral Corporation would be the coordinat-ing corporation to supply inservice train-ing and day-carefacilitiesinvolvingdiversityandimagination.Insomeareasa church couldbeused.In some areas a school could be used. Insome areas an apartment house could beused. In some areas an existing day-carecenter could be used. In other areas ofthe country where there are no day-carefacilities, It might become necessary tobuild such facilities. So there Is a greatvariety.The Senator from Louisiana is brIng-ing forth a new concept where the oldconcepts have failed. Unfortunately, thebureaucracy that exists through Ameri-can life is just as strong in the entiresocial welfare field and there is a reluc-tance to try out new concepts and newIdeas.The Ideas that are advanced by theSenator from Louisiana deserve our at-tentlon and cooperation. Three men willbe appointed by the President of theUnited States with the advice and con-sent of the Senate to run the Corporation.It will have an advisory committee toadvise the Directors,The bill would permit the Child CareCorporation to make available a widevariety of child-care services where theyare not available today. Such serviceswould include educational, recreational,and home-care services.No welfare agency, no community, noIndividual has any obligation to use thefacilities supplied by the Federal Cor-poration. They can use any facilities Inexistence or to come Into existence. Thisis not mandatory. It just Is a mechanismto allow day care to become a reality.The goal of the Corporation Is to arrangeto make child care services availablewhere they are needed. Its first prioritywill be to provide service to welfare re-cipients who need child care to undertakeemployment.I have been intimately connected formany years with this great movement,and there is no group more dedicated tothe improvement of social service lawsthan those In the day-care-center move-ment. Yet they have had great difficultygetting the movement off the ground,and, consequently, we find ourselves asa nation with only 10 percent of ourneeds being provided.I commend the Senator from Louisianafor realizing that there is a new method,a new concept, to take care of the prob-lems of tomorrow. I would hope the Sen-ate would give attention to a new Ideaand recognize that his proposal Is worthtrying because past methods and pastideas have failed. December 29, 1970 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATE S 21331In addition, Mr. President, two otherspecific provisions of the pending socialsecurity legislation, HR. 17550, deservespecial consideration and support by theSenate.Since the original medicare programwas enacted in1965, over 20 millionAmericans have been enrolled and areeligible for its benefits. However, manyAmericans have not been permitted toshare inthis program. In particular,public employees in a number of States,including Connecticut, are not eligiblefor medicare because they have not beenpartofthenationalsccialsecurity program.Several years ago, I introduced legis-lation to permit these employees to enrollin medicare. I introduced similar legis-lation again during this Congress. I ampleased to report that both the Houseof Representatives and the Senate Fi-nance Committee have approved thisconcept. Section 202 of the present billwould permit voluntary enrollment in thehospital insurance program of peoplereaching age 65 who are not part of thesocial security system. The cost of thismedicare insurance is estimated at $27a month. State and public organizations,by agreement with the Secretary ofHealth, Education, and Welfare will bepermitted to purchase this needed protec-tion for their members on a group basis.The persons now affected most severe-ly by exclusion from medicare are Stateand local employees, including three-quarters ofa million teachers in 13 Statesaswellaspolicemenand firemen, who are not part of the socialsecurity program but belong to their ownretirement plan. Because eligibility formedicare was originally predicated oneligibilityforsocial securitybenefits,these men and women who serve thepublic and teach our children have beenleft out of the medicare program.Some type of hospital insurance, ofcourse, has been available to these peo-ple, but only limited coverage is offered.Few privateinsurers make availablecomprehensive hospital insurance to theaged. Eligibility for medicare will as-sume these citizens of adequate healthprotection.Mr. President, I am also pleased tonotethatthislegislationmakes anurgently needed and long-overdue in-crease in the retirement income tax cred-it available to taxpayers 65 years of ageor over who have retired under a pub-lic retirement system.Since social security benefits are nottaxed, itis only a matter of equity toprovide an offsetting tax credit for re-tirees who are not eligible for social se-curity but have contributed to a retire-ment plan other than social security.The retirement income tax credit wasfirst enacted into law in 1954. In 1962,the credit for an individual was increasedantI a corresponding increase for marriedcouples was passed in 1964. Since thattime, social security benefits have beenincreased substantially: by 7 percent in1965, 13 percent in 1967, 15 percent in1969, and an additional 10 percent inthe Senate version of HR. 17550.Regrettably, the retirement income taxcredit has not kept pace.On September 29, 1969, I introducedlegislation to restore an element of taxequity to many of our older citizens byincreasing the base amount on whichthe retirement credit is computed from$1524 to $1,872 for individuals and from$2286 to $2,805 This $228.60 to $280.80 individuals andfrom $342.90 to $421.20 for couples. I ampleased that the House of Representa-tives and the Senate Finance Commit-tee have adopted this provision and Ihope the full Senate will support it.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Louisiana has 1 minute re-maining. Does the Senator yield backhis time?Mr. LONG. Mr. President, how muchtime remains on both sides?The PRESIDING OFFICER. Less than1 minute now.Mr. LONG. Just to summarize, Mr.President, we have heard the oppositionto doing something to provide child careby Senators who themselves have intro-duced measures in this area. The meas-ure of the Senator from New York wouldcost about $3 billion. The Senator fromIndiana has a bill that would cost $6billion. The Senator from Minnesota hasa bill that might cost more than $6 bil-lion.In the committee bill, we are simplytrying to provide $50 million to get aCorporation started in order to try tosee that child care is provided. That isthe best we have been able to work outin committee. In the past, we have notbeen able to get the job done by just pro-viding money, so this time we provideboth money and a mechanism to get thejob done.The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I yield control of my time to the Senatorfrom Louisiana (Mr. LONG).Mr. LONG. Mr. President, I yield my-self 3 minutes.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized for3 minutes.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, notwith-standing the disappointment shared bymany in this body, Including the chair-man of the committee, that parts of thecommittee-reported bill that we wouldlike to see enacted cannot become law inthis session of Congress, there yet re-mains in the bill $7.5 billion in benefitsunder social security and public welfareprograms to beneficiaries, to persons whofind it necessary to come to the publicwelfare program for assistance, and tothose persons who desire jobs, job train-ing, and child care, and other opportuni-ties for a better life.I think, Mr. President, that this is alandmark bill, that it is one of the largestsocial security-public welfare bills everpassed in the history of this country. Infact,itmay very well be the largestbill of its kind in the public welfare and so-cial security areas, perhaps even moresignificant than the medicare bill, so farO:3as size and the effort to get on with thejob of caring for those who depend uponour public welfare and our social securitysystems are concerned.,So I hope that the Senate will pass thisbill. I believe that when we review whatremains, we will find that this is a goodbill and a credit to the Senate.Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, I want topay a well-deserved tribute to the dis-tinguished Senator from Louisiana (Mr.LONG). He has spent long hours on thisbill. In thehearings,he has been emi-nently fair in every respect, allowingevery member of the committee to pre-sent his views fully. The work he hasdone and the motion he made in com-mittee in support of the $100 minimumfor social security, which is now a part ofthe bill, and the efforts he jpined intoward raising the benefits by 10 per-cent, and the other wholesome provi-sions in the bill, are primarily due to hisdiligent work and dedicated efforts forthe people of this country who are servedby the social security, medicare, medi-caid,and welfare programs ofthis country.I honor him as my chairman of thecommittee, I believe he is entitled to thehighest praise of the Senate for the billthat is now before us and is, I hope, about to be passed.Mr. LONG. I thank the Senator fromOklahoma. I salute him for the effectivework the Senator has done in the com-mittee, as well as here on the Senatefloor, in regard to matters in which hewas interested. I also believe it is wellto point out that the Senators on thecommittee, the Senator from Georgia(Mr. TALMADGE), the Senator from Utah(Mr. BENNETT), the Senator from Con-necticut (Mr. RIBIc0FF), and others, allmade major contributions to the bill thatstands before us. Although there is, ofcourse, a great deal of room for revisionand debate on the controversial items, Ithink the Senate has come forth with anextremely significant bill and one whichI believe will do the Senate credit.Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, Ijoin other Senators in congratulating the dis-tinguished Senator from Louisiana. Itcould almost be said in advance that thiscould not be done. The Senator fromLouisiana, in a rare example of subordi-nating his own feelings and his own deepconvictions, got it done. I think he isentitled to all the credit we can give him.Even on the Child Care Corporation onwhich we differ, I have never said andI do not say now that it is not an ingeni-ous and fresh Idea. I can pledge to theSenator, for myself, that I will dig intothis matter very, carefully. For all I know,we may well end up with exactly that. Sothat I think the Senator has served theSenate remarkably well, and I would liketo join my colleagues in paying tributeto the Senator from Louisiana.I also join with my colleagues in praiseof those colleagues and staff persons ofboththeexecutiveandlegislativebranches who worked so hard on thefamily assistance plan, and particularlyof Mitchell Ginsburg, former head of theHuman Resources Administration andnow dean of Columbia School of RacialWork, who so tirelessly made every effort S 21334 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEDecember 29, 1970to obtain passage this year. It is my hopethat early and favorable considerationnext year will make this year's effort afulfilled one both for the individualworker and for the poor.Mr. TALMADGE. Mr. President, I wish to join my colleagues, the Senatorfrom Oklahoma and the Senator fromNew York, in paying tribute to our dis-tinguished chairman for his work in ac-complishing legislative results which willtake place momentarily in the passageof one of the most momentous bills whichwill have passed the Senate since 1 be-came a Member of this body.I think that the amendments we havemade to the Social Security Act raisingthe benefits by 10 percent with a min-imum of $100 a month can do a greatdeal for the needy people of our country.Also the amendments that raise the ben-efits to our aged, blind, and the totallydisabled people will be of tremendousbenefit to millions of Americans.Also a number of amendments in thefield of medicare and medicaid will bemost beneficial to hundreds of thousandsof Americans as well as to the taxpayersof this country.In the area of welfare reform, the Sen-ate Finance Committee adopted amend-ments which I,offered, that were basedprimarily upon the Auerbach Report, agovernment-financed study of the workincentive program. These amendmentswill at long last bring some real reformInto the area of welfare and will offertraining and job opportunities to our peo-ple to the point that they will have an in-come and will become taxpayers ratherthan beneficiaries of welfare.I, too, want to pay tribute to our rank-ing minority member, Senator WILLIAMSof Delaware, who has made great con-tributions. The Senator frbm Connecti-cut (Mr. RIBIc0FF), the Senator fromWyoming (Mr. HANSEN), the Senatorfrom Iowa (Mr. MILLER), the Senatorfrom Arizona (Mr. FANNIN), the Senatorfrom Oklahoma (Mr. HARRIS), the Sen-ator from New Mexico (Mr. ANDERSON),the Senator from Tennessee (Mr. GoRE),the Senator from Minnesota (Mr. Mc-CARTHY), the Senator from Indiana (Mr.HARTKE), the Senator from Arkansas(Mr. FULBRIGHT), the Senator from Vir-ginia (Mr. BYRD), the Senator from Utah(Mr. BENNETT), the Senator from Ne-braska (Mr. CURTIS), and the Senatorfrom Idaho (Mr. JORDAN) Ofl both sidesof the aisle made major contributions tothis mammoth piece of legislation.I think it is a landmark in the historyof the Senate.I congratulate my distinguished chair-man and all the members of the FinanceCommittee who made such valiant con-trthutlons.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The timeof the Senator has expired.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, I ask unani-mous consent that I be recognized for 5additional minutes.The PRESIDrNG OFFICER. Withoutobjection, It Is so ordered.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, I yield to theSenator from Connecticut.Mr. RIBICOFF. Mr. President, thelegislation that we are about to pass hasmuch In it that is worthwhile.I must repeat, however, my disappoint-ment that the family assistance programdid not come to a vote. I believe the Sen-ate should have been given the oppor-tunity to vote on the merits of this pro-posal.I, too, have the highest praise for thechairman and the other members of theFinance Committee for their hard work.I take a few minutes to pay tribute tomy legislativeassistant, Mr. TaggartAdams, who over the period of a year hasworked so closely with me on the familyassistance program. He has shown ex-treme dedication and his knowledge cer-tainly makes us all realize the value ofstaff assistance in our work in the Senate.I would say that no Member of theSenate knows more about the family as-sistance program than Mr. TaggartAdams.I also pay tribute to Mr. Mitchell Gins-berg of New York, now dean of Univer-sity of Columbia School of Social Work,who really literally worked himself sickin trying to work out the compromisesnecessary to resolve the many differenceswhich arose in drafting a workable f am-ily assistance program. Mitchell Gins-berg deserves the things of everyone'sconcern with alleviating the blight ofpoverty in the United States. I think itwill be shown that these two men havebeen one most responsible for developingthe foundations necessary for the even-tual passage of family assistance.Special tribute should also be paid tothe following members of the Depart-ment of HEW, Under Secretary JackVeneman, Deputy Under Secretary BobPatricelli, Special Assistant to the Under-secretary Tom Joe, and Deputy AssistantSecretary Howard Cohen.I am confident that early next year theSenate will have an opportunity to com-pletely consider and debate the familyassistance program, and I predict thatthe family assistance program will beadopted next year. The men I havenamed must be credited with a large partof this success.I also point out that, while on the floortoday by a narrow vote, the chairman'sproposal for a child care corporation wasstricken from the bill, it is my personalopinion that this is one of the most im-aginative proposals to have come forthin the entire field of social welfare. Onceit is understood that we are breaking outfrom the bureaucracy and treating socialproblems, I believe that next year theSenate will have a better opportunity tounderstand the proposal of the Senatorfrom Louisiana and the Senate will adoptit.Mr. PASTORE. Mr. President, will theSenator yield?Mr. LONG. I yield.Mr. PASTORE. Mr. President, I joinmy colleagues in paying tribute to themembers of the committee, particularlyto the chairman of the committee whomarshalled this bill through to a success-ful enactment. The Senate bill providesfor a 10-percent increase for those onsocial welfare as against a 5-percent pro-vision by the House.I would hope that the same kind of in-genuity, the same kind of acumen andenergy will be exerted in the conferenceto have the House go along with the Sen-ate on a 10-percent increase rather than5 percent.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, I yield tothe Senator from California.Mr. CRANSTON. Mr. President, I joinin paying tribute to the chairman of thecommittee for the remarkable work heand the committee have done.Let me say first to the chairman thathis fairness, tolerance, patience, skill,and good humor all throughout the con-sideration of this measure have been tre-mendous. He has won for himself the un-dying respect of many Senators for hisperformance on this measure.May I ask the distinguished chairmana question about section 520 of the pend-ing measure?In title V of the there are a number ref-erences in section 520 to \"public serv-ice employment.\"I worked very closely with the chair-man on this matter and with SenatorTALMADGE who offered it in Committee,and Senator RIBIc0FF, who also has agreat interest in this subject and hadprepared a parallel amendment.I understand that \"Operation Main-stream\" and \"New Careers\u2014programsauthorized in part E of the EconomicOpportunity Act of 1964, as amended\u2014would be included within the public serv-ice employment intended by the pend-ing measure.I would like to read very briefly fromthe Economic Opportunity Act, part E,section 161, a portion of the congressionalfinding with respect to the OperationMainstream and New Careers programs.The Congress found that:These two programs jproviding jobs forthe unemployed and low-income personsleading to broader career opportunities areuniquely effective; that, in addition to pro-viding persons assisted with jobs, the key totheir economic independence, these pro- grams are of advantage to the community atlarge in that they are directed at communitybeautification and betterment and the im-provement of health, education, welfare, pub-lic safety, and other public services;Am I correct in my assumption thatsuch programs will be included in theconcept of public service amendmentenvisaged by the bill?The PRESIDING OFFICER. The timeof the Senator has expired.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, I ask un-animous consent that I may have suchtime as I require.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Withoutobjection, it is so ordered.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, the Sena-tor is entirely correct. He will find thecommittee report emphasizes and under-lines what he is saying here, that it isexpected that the Secretary would takefull advantage of these existing programsin providing public service employment.Mr. CRANSTON. Mr. President, I askunanimous consent to have printed atthis point in the RECORD part E of sec-tions 161 through 167, the Economic Op-portunity Act of 1964, as amended, al-ready referred to.

ProgramS assisted under thispart shall be subject to the provisions ofsection 131 of-this Act.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, the Senatorfrom Georgia and the Senator from Con-necticut led the fight on this particularprovision. The Senator is correct in hisinterpretation of that section.Mr. TALMADGE. Mr. President, theamendment was based primarily uponthe Auerbach report which was financedwith Federal funds. They made their re-port and neither the Department of HEWnol' the Labor Department put their re-commendations into effect.It was the opinion of the Committeeon Finance that they ought to be putinto effect.I had offered an amendment making10 important changes in the work in-centive program. The distinguished Sen-ator from Connecticut had offered someamendments along parallel lines. In com-mittee, the Senator from Connecticutvery gallantly said:I think that Senator Talmadge's amend-ments are better than mine. I think hisamendments should be adopted.That is what the committee did.We are hopeful that these amend-ments will bring some order out of chaosin the WIN program which was adoptedby the Senate 3 years ago and neverfully implemented.Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-sent that my speech of July 20, intro-ducing my amendment, be printed in theRECORD at this point in my remarks.My amendment was submitted as anamendment to HR. 16311, the FamilyAssistance Act passed by the House. How-ever, when the Finance Committee re-jected the Family Assistance Plan, I of-fered my proposal as an amendment toHR. 17550, the Social Security Amend-nients of 1970.There being no objection, the ma-terial was ordered to be printed in theRECORD, as follows:SUBMISSION OF AMENDMENT TO H.. 16311THE FAMILY ASSISTANCE Ac'rAMENDMENT NO. 788Mr. TALMADGE. Mr. President on severalprevious occasions I have spoken out againstcertain aspects of HR. 16311, the adminis-tration's Family Assistance Act.I have expressed doubts about the cost fig-ures given by the administration.I have expressed grave reservations aboutthe work incentive aspects of the bill.I have shown the weaknesses of the evi-dence produced by the \"New Jersey experi-ment.\" which is the only proof that this ad-ministration has presented to show that itsfamily assistance plan will work.On May 14, I introduced an amendmentto change the name of HR. 16311 from \"TheFamily Assistance Act of1970\" to \"TheWelfare Expansion Act of 1970.\" This wasdone to clarify the true issues involved in theFinance Committee's consideration of thislegislation.Although the administration's bill has beenwidely touted as welfare reform, the thiefcharacteristic of the bill which passed theHouse of Representatives is not welfare re-form. It is welfare expansion. The most no-ticeable feature of this legislation 18 to cx-tend welfare benefits to 16 million additionalAmericans.I had hoped that the revised ver8iOfl ofHR. 16311, which the administration recentlysent back to the Finance Committee, wouldCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATE S 21336makemeaningful improvements which wouldadd substance to administration rhetoric.Unfortunately, I have been disappointed.The purpose of the amendment I offer to-day is to strengthen the work incentive, jobtraining, and job placement features of theadministration bill so that the administra-tion slogan about \"workfare rather than wel-fare\" will have an element of truth.When President Nixon first announced inAugust 1969 that he would seek major wel-fare legislation, he selected ashis major theme his intention to \"turn welfare intoworkfare.\" Listening to the kind of publicitygiven to the President's proposals, you wouldget the impression that Congress had neverturned its attention to the problems in-volved in making welfare recipients Inde-pendent.As my colleagues in the Senate know, thisIs simply not the case. Eight years ago. Con-gress passed the Public Welfare Amendmentsof 1962, which were aimed at preventing orreducing dependency by offering rehabili-tative and other social services to welfarerecipients and other persons likely to becomedependent.This approach was not sufficient, however.and as the welfare rolls began increasing atan accelerated rate, the Committee on Fi-nance in 1967 designed the work incentiveprogram which subsequently became law.I supported the establishment of the workincentive program at that time, and I stillfeel that it Is good basic legislation.The Labor Department in administeringit, however, has failed to meet the promiseof the legislation to lead welfare recipientsto useful productive lives.All too often petty Jealousy between theLabor Department and the Department ofHealth, Education, and Welfare, on the localas well as the national level, ha underminedthe program's Sound intent, and both De-partments have generously provided fundsto the National Welfare Rights Organization,whose stated goal Is to defeat the purposesof the work incentive program,The resultisunderstandable. Aithoughthere are about 10 million people who receivewelfare In this country. Only about 50,000are currently enrolled in a work Incentiveprogram. Inept administration of the WINprogram has made it a dismal failure.Mr. President, in view of this record ofdismal failure, one wouid think that theadministration would have given highestpriority to strengthening and reforming Jobtraining and job placement programs in anyproposed welfare reform bill.But what does the administration's welfarebill do? It repeals the present program, re-placing it with vague provisions allowing theSecretary of Labor to provide any kind oftraining he may feel like providing to anyperson registered Under the family assistanceplan in whatever order of priority he deemsappropriate.Since the bill requires the registration ofpersons already working full time, the Sec.retary may decide not to train persons whosesole income is from welfare, hut only to takepeople out of work who are now workingand to train them for other jobs. Because thebill would extend what amounts to a mili-tary pay raise to 50.000 military families, theSecretary of Labor could decide to providetraining only to privates on KP.The examples I have named may soundridiculou8, Mr. President, but this couldhappen under the vague language of thePresident's welfare bill now pending in theSenate Committee on Finance.The past record of the Department of Laborand the Department of Health, Education,and Welfare in administering the work in-centive program convinces me that suchridiculous examples are not beyond the realmof possibility,On April 29 and 30, and May 1, the Com-mittee on Finance began its hearings on theCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEPresident's welfare bill. We recessed themafter21/adays, after hearing from formerSecretary of Health, Education, and WelfareRobert Finch, because it became clear thatthe administration knew very little about itsbill and its impact.In fact, today, 2',' months later, the De-partment is still working on the answers toquestions we raised at the end of April aboutthe bill. For example, present law has sinceJuly 1969 required States to disregard a por-tion of earnings in determining need for wel-fare as a work incentive,I asked the Secretary on April 29 how manywelfare recipients have benefited from theseearned income disregard provisions, and towhat extent earnings of welfare recipientshave Increased as a result of this provision.This seemed to me a very basic question inview of the fact the Department was recom-mending substantial changes in the earnedincome exemption. I found to my surprisethat they had no idea of the answer of thisquestion. To this date they have not sub.mltted the answer to my question of 2'/2 months ago, and this is but one of many ex-amples.Mr. President, in a way I am sorry wedid not have the chance to interrogatethe Secretary of Labor before the hear-ings were recessedinthe beginningof May. For if we had questioned him, I amsure that the Department of Labor wouldhave taken more seriously the committee'sdirective that the bill be rewritten to providea meaningful work incentive program.In looking through the administration'srevised bill, I find that they have made nosubstantive change of note in the work in-centive provisions.Mr. President. the Labor Department lastyear contracted with Auerbach Corp. to re-view and evaluate operations under the workincentive program. That firm conducted on-site visits incities and reviewed the pro-grams-there in depth. The report of the Auer-bach Corp. states that:\"The basic idea of WIN is workable\u2014thoughsome aspects of the legislation require modi-fication.\"The Auerbach report details the adminis-trative, and in some cases legislative changeswhich are needed in the light of experienceto improve the sound legislation Congressenacted in 1967.Unfortunately,theadministrationhas largely ignored the conclusions of the Auer-bach report and has gone off in another di-rection in the legislative proposals it has in-corporated in both the original welfare billand in the administration revision.Today, Mr. President, I am submitting anamendment to the welfare bill designed toimprove the present work incentive programalong the lines that experience has shownare necessary. I would like to Outline herewhat my amendment'wouid do.First, it would mandate coordlnatlon be-tween the Departments of Labor and Health,Education, and Welfare on the national, re-gional and local levels. Today, certain regu-lations of the Department of Health, Educa-tion, and Welfare on the work incentive pro-gram confict with regulations of the Depart-ment of Labor. My amendment would re-quire that all regulations on the work its-centive program be issued Jointly by bothagencies, and that they be issued within 6months of enactment of the bill.Second, it requires that a Joint HEW-Laborcommittee be set up to assure that forms,reports, and other matters are handled con-sistently between the two departments. ItIs imperative that the work incentive pro-gram be operated under one set or guide-lines, policies, and administrative procedures.Third,under presentlawthewelfare agency is supposed to prepare an employ-ability plan for each appropriate case andmake referraLs to the Department of Labor.December 29, 1970The Department of Labor is then to preparean employability plan and place the indi-vidual in employment', on-the-job training,institutional training, or public service em-ployment. Problems have arisen in this proc-ess.In some cases, the welfare agency has notreferred sufficient numbers of persons, whilein other cases they have referred too manypersons, without first arranging for the sup-portive services, such as day care, needed forthe welfare recipient to participate in thework incentive program. Due to lack of co-ordination between the welfare agency andthe Labor Department, persons have some-times been referred who do not match thetraining or employment opportunities avail-able in the area.My amendment would solve this problemby requiring the welfare agency to set up aunit with the responsibility of arranging forsupportive services so that the welfare re-cipients may participate in the work incen-tive program. Furthermore, it would requirethat the welfare agency and the Labor De-partment on the local level enter into a Jointagreement on an operational plan\u2014that is,the kinds of training they will arrange for,the kinds of job development the Labor De-partment will undertake, and the kinds ofJob opportunities both agencies will have toprepare persons for during the period cov-ered by the plan. In addition, both agencieswill Jointly develop employability plans forindividuals, consistent with the overall op-erational plan, which will assure that indi-viduals will receive the necessary supportiveservices and preparation for employmentwithout unnecessary waiting.Fourth, on-the-Job training and publicservice employment have been virtually non-existent under the work incentive programas administered by the Department of Labor.Instead, that Department has spent most ofthe work incentive program appropriationson institutional training, which often did notlead to employment, particularly in today'srising unemployment. What is lacking is Jobdevelopment, through utilization of both on-the-Job training with private employers, andpublic service employment.My amendment would require that 40 per-cent of the funds spent under the work in-centive program appropriation be for on-the-job training and public service employment.If at least this amount is not spent on pro-grams which in effect guarantee placement,it seems to me that we are wasting moneyif we spend it on institutional training.Fifth, as an incentive for employers in theprivate market to hire individuals who areplacedintheir employment through thework incentive program, my amendmentwould provide a tax credit equal to 20 per-cent of the wages and salaries of these indi-viduals. The credit would apply to wagespaid to these employees during their first 12months of employment. The tax credit wouldbe recaptured .1 the employer terminated theemployment of the individual during thefirst 12 months of his employment or beforethe end of the following 12 months. Thisrecapture provision would not apply if theemployeebecamedisabledorleftwork voluntarily.This tax incentive approach Is an adapta-tion of a bill I have Introduced previously,S. 3156, the Employment Opportunity Act of1969. That bill provides for a tax credit forjob training and for employees who are hiredfrom a work incentive program.The tax incentive is a key provision ofmy amendment. No work incentive or Jobtraining program can ever be successful un-less we have the full cooperation of privatebusiness interests. In many cases, welfarereciplentswill be very poor employmentrisks. They will need a great deal of costlytraining and special consideration beforethey can achieve full productivity. It is un-fair and unrealistic to expect a profit-moti- December 29, 1970 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATE S 21337vated businessman to undertake this re-sponsibilitywithout some compensation.My tax Incentive provision Is designed tobridge the gap between a government pro-gram and productive employment.Sixth, my amendment would simplify funding arrangements for public service em-ployment under the work incentive programby providing 100 percent Federal funding forthe first year, and a 90-percent Federal shar-ing of the costs in subsequent years.Seventh, my amendment would establishclear priority among persons registering foremployment and training by requiring theSecretary of Labor to accord priority in thefollowing order:First. Unemployed fathers;Second. Dependent children and relativesage 16 and over who are not In school, work-Ing, or in training;Third.Mothers who volunteer for par-ticipation;Fourth.Individualsworkingfull-time who wish to participate; andFifth. All other persons.My amendment would not require personsworking full time to register for employ-ment and training, although they couldvolunteer to upgrade their skills ifthey wished. Under my amendment, no motherwould be required to undergo work and train-ing until every single person who volunteeredfor work and training was first placed. Theevidence shows that there are many morepersons who wish to participate voluntarilythan the program can reasonably handle inthe foreseeable future.Eighth, my amendment would require, ona State-by-State basis, that at least 15 per-cent of the registrants for the work Incen-tive program be enrolled in the programeach year. If the State falls below this level,Federal matching for State supplementarypayments would be reduced.Ninth, operations under the work incen-tive program have often failed to meet theobjective of the program because too littleattention was paid to the actual labor marketconditions and requirements in the geo-graphic area. My amendment would requirethe establishment of local labor-market ad-visory councils whose function it would beto Identify present and future local labor-market needs. The findings of this councilwould serve as the basis for the work in-centive program operational plans on thelocal level.Finally, my amendment would specify thatappropriations for the work incentive pro-gram be allocated among the States in pro-portion to the number of registrants for em-ployment and training in the States.Mr. President, my amendment would makebasic and fundamental changes in the workincentive provisions of the President's familyassistance plan. However, it would not solveall the problems that Inherent in HR. 16311.I know that other members of the FinanceCommittee have their own ideas as to how tocorrect some of the deficiencies and the in.-equities in the administration's revised bill.We will resume hearings on the family as-sistance plan tomorrow.I would not care to predict whether theFamilT Assistance Act will receive the ap-proval of the Finance Committee and -theSenate during the current session. I do, how-ever, want to emphasize that I consider myamendment vital, whether we have a familyassistance plan this year or In the distantfuture.No one is more aware than I that the Gov-ernment has a responsibility to provide forIndividuals who are unable to care for them-selves\u2014the aged, blind, disabled, and thevery young. My legislative record in this ses-sion and in past sessions of Congress willshow that I have consistently supported andsometimes introduced measures to benefitthis group.However, I feel equally strong that we cannever solve the social problems of this Nationby guaranteeing able-bodied Individuals aminimum standardofliving.The chief thrust of any reform effort must be directedat providing job training and job placementfor those Individuals who are able and willingto work.Mr. President, I believe that this amend-nient will provide a constructive alternativeto the very deficient provisions in the welfarebill before the Finance Committee.Mr. CRANSTON. Mr. President, theSenator from Georgia has been veryhelpful and tremendously cooperative onthis important aspect of the bill. I ammost grateful to him.Mr. TALMADGE. Mr. President, allthe members of the committee deservethe praise in this case, My ainendment.swere adopted unanimously. The staff ofthe Finance Committee as well as myown staff have worked diligently formonths on this matter. I offered theseamendments hoping to bring some orderout of chaos. The Committee on Financeadopted them unanimously without anychange whatever.Mr. RIBICOFF. Mr. President, I con-firm the comments of the Senator fromLouisiana and the Senator from Georgia.We were disturbed in the Finance Com-mittee over the fact that the WIN pro-gram was not successful and was notbeing utilized. The estimates of the De-partment of Labor were much lower thanshould have been the case. The provisionsin the bill provide that at least 40 per-cent of the funds be spent for publicservice jobs or on job training with somemeaning of the interpretation of thedefinition read by the Senator from Cali-fornia with respect to the concept of pub-lic service jobs.We would hope the Labor Departmentwould really become interested and be-come involved in public service jobs andon-the-job training so there would bemeaningful reason to move people out ofwelfare, and not into dead end jobs.Mr. CRANSTON. Mr. President, I wishto express my thanks to the Senator fromConnecticut for his leadership in thisarea and open-mindedness and courtesythroughout.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, I yield tothe Senator from Nebraska.Mr. CURTIS. Mr. President, I joinSenators in paying tribute to our dis-tinguished chairman, the Senator fromLouisiana (Mr. LONG). He has been verycourteous and fair with all members ofthe committee. He has so conducted him-self on the floor of the Senate.It seems to me 1 can never recall acase where a chairman has gone to suchlengths to complete a bill and waivepoints in it which he personally desiredvery much. There were provisions in thebillas reported by the committee inwhich my distinguished chairman wasvery much interested. Yet in order thatthe bill might advance and in order thatour social security beneficiaries mighthave an Increase in benefits now, hewaived those provisions\u2014not for otherprovisions in the bill, but because of thethreat of floor amendments. I think he Isto be commended for that.I personally wish to thank the chair-man for his kindness to me. I also wouldlike to include praise for the distin-guished Senator from Delaware (Mr.WILLIAMS) who is retiring. Had the Sen-ate followed the lead of the chairman ofthe Committee on Finance and the rank-ing minority member (Mr. WILLIAMS)this matter could have been disposed ofdays ago and we could have moved nearercompletion of our business and restora-tion of the respect of the country.Again I wish to pay tribute to our finestafffortheirdedicated work, longhours, professional competence and Iknow they will be called upon for a greatdeal of intensive and difficult work andlong hours as we approach the confer-ence on the bill.Mr. LONG. Mr. President, I thank theSenator.I yield to the Senator from Iowa.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Iowa Is recognized.Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, I thankthe distinguished Senator from Lou-isiana. I wish to join with other Senatorson the committee In extending apprecia-tion and praise to him for the excellentjob he has done in managing this veryimportant bill. Like all important piecesof legislation to come before the Senate,there are some things in the bill whichwe like and there are some things in thebill which we do not like.To me one of the most serious defectsin the bill is the fact that the $100 mini-mum social security is to be funded outof the social security trust fund. As Ipointed out on the floor previously thismeans that the relatively low-incomewage earners who are trying to maintaintheir families are going to be paying so-cial security taxes to make up for thelack of taxes paid by so many of theserecipients of the $100 minimum.There Is no question that many ofthose $100 minimum recipients need themoney, but that money should comefrom the general fund of the Treasuryand not out of the hides of the low-income people who are paying taxes.That causes a very serious minus in thebill.I am also disappointed that the billdoes not contain something covering ca-tastrophic illness, disease, and injury.The Senator from Louisiana offeredwhat I thought was a reasonable ap-proach to this serious problem, one weshould have faced up to and taken actionon even before action on medicare andmedicaid.As I said in the debate on medicare, Ican become more concerned about a man35 years of age who Is taken with mul-tiple sclerosis than with someone whohappens to be over 65 who may be awealthy Individual. The Senate has notfaced up to that serious problem.The Senator from Louisiana did hisbest to meet that situation. I compli-ment him on his statesmanship In beingwilling to delete this very importantprovision in order to get on with the jobof the social security bill.But Mr. President, the most unprece-dented and most important feature ofthe bill is the automatic increase In so-cial security benefits to keep pace withincreases in the cost of living. S 21338The Senate will recall that in 1982, wetook such action with respect to civilservice retirees. That is what gave methe idea to introduce, and I believe it wasfor the first time, a proposal in 1963 toprovide for automatic increases.in socialsecurity benefits to keep pace with in-creases in the cost of living. I said at thetime I introduced this.proposal that ifwe did that in 1962, for civil service re-tirees, we should do it for social securitybeneficiaries. I introduced that proposalagain in 1965, in 1967, and in 1969.Thanks to the attention and the hardwork on the part of some of my col-leagues and a number of the senior citi-zens' organizations around the country,this proposal has been increasing in itsbipartisanship and support. Last yearPresident Nixon was the first Presidentin the history of this country to recom-mend such a proposal to Congress. Ithink it is a great thing that we now havethis pretty well locked into law becausethe House bill does contain the basic ele-ments of the automatic increase pro-vision.There ar a few differences over thefinancing, but I am sure those can behandled in conference. So, Mr. President,above everything in this bill, I think thisis of utmost importance. I have talked toa great many older people, not only In myState, but all around the country, and Ifthere is one priority they want, it Is someassurance that if infiaticn is going totake over and diminish tbe purchasingpower of their benefits, that there wouldbe some automatic way of enabling themto roll with the punch of inflation sothey would not be hit with hardship.It is true that over the years Congressperiodically has increased social securitybenefits so that over a period of yearswe might say we have caught up to in-flation; but the fact rem7iris that duringthe Interim literally billions of dollarshave been taken away from social se-curity beneficiaries because of inflation,and these losses have not been coveredby Congress when we finally got aroundto increasing benefits.In connection with my concern overthe $100 minimum, I ask unanimous con-sent that there be printed in the Recordexcerpts from my separate views whichare printed on page 447 of the committeereport.There being no objection, the excerptwas ordered to be printed in the REcoRD,as follows:SEPARATxVIEWS 0? MR. MILLERSSSSSecond,the Increase in the minimum so-cial security benefits from the present $64per month to $100 per month at an annualcost of $1.5 billion to the social security trustfund is inequitable. Acting Impulsively onthe simplistic plea that \"no one can live onSixty four dollars a month\", the Senate lastDecember adopted such an amendment tothe Tax Reform Act of 1969. This was quicklydisposed of by the House Conferees duringthe conference on the bill who noted that alarge number of the recipients of the socialsecurity minimum already receive benefitsfrom one or two other pensions\u2014civil serviceretirement, state and local retirement, or pri-CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEvatecorporation retirement; and that stateold age assistance payments prevent anyonefrom having to live on $64 per month. Insteadof applying the proposed 10 percent increasein social security benefits across the boardstoinclude the present minimum, whichwould mean an Increase from $64 to $70.40per month, the bill provides an increase inthe minimum to $100\u2014regardless of need\u2014at a cost to the taxpayers of $1.5 billion peryear.Worse yet, this $1.5 billion plus also theamount needed to cover a 10 percent increasein the minimum would be paid for by thosepaying social security taxes into the socialsecurity trust fund. Inasmuch as those whoreceive the \"minimum\" have not paid taxessufficient to cover their benefits, the load Isthrown on those who are already payingtaxes sufficient to cover their benefits. Inshort, most of the minimum social securitybenefits provided by the bill represents wel-fare\u2014not tax paid insurance. Itshould, therefore, be paid out of the general fundof the Treasury. Moreover, as welfare, thepayments should be made on the basis ofneed, taking into account other resources ofthe recipient.The bill makes no attempt to order ourpriorities. Instead, it contains all major so-cial security proposals\u2014the 10 percent in-crease, the increase to $100 in the minimum,and coverage of catastrophic illness and dis-ease. It would seem that the single mosturgent action to be taken\u2014one that shouldhave been taken long ago, before medicareand medicaid\u2014is coverage of catastrophicillness and disease. Also, it is only fair tobring social security benefits into line withincreases in the cost of living which haveoccurred since benefits were last increased.It would appear that this would fall some-where between the 5 percent increase pro-vided by the House and the 10 percent in-crease provided by the Senate Finance Com-mittee. The increase in the \"minimum\"\u2014particularly the $1.5 billion needed to gobeyondacost-of-livingincrease\u2014isin- equitable and excessive.Those who would be paying the bill shouldknow what lies in store for them. The taxbase would be raised from $7,800 to $9,000,with the following rate changes:TAX RATES ON BOTH percentj 1980-857.8'8.5'8.5 I Additional costs of cash beneFits are borne by employer.employee too revenue because 017 percent limitalioc on tax forUnderwriting cash benefits.

Mr. President, I thankthedistinguishedchairmanofthe committee.I think it would be redundant to repeatwhat has been so beautifully said alreadyabout the great job that has been doneby our chairman and by the staff.I do want to take this occasion to notethe great contribution that has beenmade by the distinguished Senator fromDelaware, who Isretiring by his ownchoice from the Senate and this commit-tee at this time.I suspect that I share the feelings thateveryone else in the country does overthe failure of this Congress to get Intowelfare reform, but I am not certain atall that some of the proposals that weremade would have achieved the objectivesthat were spelled out by tile President ofthe United States\u2014objectives to which Isuspect we could all subscribe.In this regard, I think the contributionthat has been made by our great andloved friend from Delaware (Mr. WIL-LIAMs) may be significant as the yearsroll along.I am especially appreciative of thegreat job our chairman has done in hear-ing this matter, in seeing that everyonewho had a contribution to make wasgiven an opportunity to ha'e his say.I hope that as we approach the com-ing session we will be able to examinemore closely and to know better before-hand what would result from some pro-posals we have had before us before theybecome the law of the land.I remember what the distinguishedSenator from Connecticut (Mr. Riax-coFF) said some time ago, when he saidhad he knpwn then what he now knows,December 29, 1970 MAXIMUMTAX ON BOTH EMPLOYER AND EMPLOYEE 1970197119721973\u20147419751976-791980-854.85.25.25.15.25.55.4 5.655.65.5 5.656.356.35 5.76.356.355.87.07.0 December 29, 197 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATE S 21339be would never have recaminended themedicare and medicaid piograins thatthis country now has without their firsthaving been tried out. I sa we oughtto take this same approach with familyassistance.I thank the distinguishd Senator foryielding to me.Mr. LONG. I thank the distinguishedSenator. May I say, in SUPPOrt of whatii0 Senator ha.s said, the distinguishedSenator from Delaware brought to theattention of the committee, and also theSenate, a great number of problems thathad not been considered when the billpassed the House of Representatives. Iam positive that when act on a morecomprehensive welfare reform, the deepinsight that was evidenced by the Sena-tor from Delaware will reflect itself inour final decision. As he painted out,while the plan sent to us looked prettygood on paper if one considered only thecash assistance program, if you lookedat the other social welfare programs\u2014food stamps, public housing medicaid,and child care\u2014in terms of a welfare re-cipient's incentive to work, then a planhad seemed on its face to make goodsense did not make much sense at all. Itwas that contribution frcm the Senatorfrom Delaware which I thnk will even-tually result in a better bifl.I would like to mention also the ardu-ous and long hours put in by the dis-tinguishedsenior Senator from NewMexico(Mr. ANDERSON, whose tmespent in the committee roam I believewas exceeded only by that of the Senatorfrom Delaware and, perhaps that of thechairman. Senator ANDERSON put in afantastic number of hours working onthis bill, and I am sure all the membersof the committee appreciate his contrib-utions to it. He is not present at thismoment, but I certainly want to men-tion the fine contributions he made.I yield to the distingushed Senatorfrom Arizona (Mr. FANNIN).Mr. FANNIN. Mr. President I join inthe tributes being paid to our distin-guished chairman for his fairness, equity,and patience. I concur in the accoladesthat have been paid to him. I especiallywant to extend my thanks to him forthe consideration iso gave mc and themany proposals I macic, especially on theconservation of jobs in this Nation ofours, his ability to relate to those prob-lems, with the long experience he hashad on the committee.I certainly commend him on the wayhehandlesthecommittee,keeping everything moving along, being patient,and still stern in his desire and demandthat we accomplish our objectives. I, too,commend him for the teamwork he hasdisplayed,workingwiththedistin- guished senior Senator from Delaware,who will now be leaving us, which willbe a great loss, A very line ierson will becaking over as the ranking minoritymember. We have had the complete co-operation of the Senator from Utah (Mr.BE!NETT) throughout the years he hasIsceis on the committee.We have a tremendous task ahead, andour chairman recognizes that. I know hehas agreed to have hearings on severalsubjects in which I am involved and,which I think are very important to thefuture of the Nation. His recognition ofthe problems has been of great help to us.Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, I askfor the yeas passage.The ordered.Mr. Mr. President, will theSenator yield me a few minutes?Mr. MANSFIELD. I yield to the Sen-ator from New York.THE NEED FOR FAMILY ASSISTANCEMr. 000DELL. Mr. President, the fic-tional honorable Senator from SouthCarolina, Seab Cooley, well summed upin one of Allen Drury's works the prob-lems which we have had with the fam-ily assistance plan and social security.He said that\u2014What worries me about that. office I Is thatia man can get to balancing so manythings against so many other things thatson-ietinses all he does is balance. He neverdoes really move . .. forward:he's too busy balancing, worrying about what this lone's Igoing to say or that lone'sl going to think.Sometimes you have to go straight aheedand say damn them all.Indeed, we have balanced. We havebalanced so judiciously, so protractedly,so well tl'mat we have balanced ourselves\u2014although necessarily so, at this point\u2014right out of the opportunity to pass themost crucial domestic legislation whichthe President has proposed. In so pro-crastinating,insoabandoning onceagain the wretched and the poor, wehave confirmed their notion that theyare, in Ralph Ellison's term, the \"in-visible men\" of this Nation\u2014those whoseneeds it is all too easy and costless toconsign to the ambiguity of the nextCongress, or to oblivion.There is, Mr. President, a dangerousnew phenomenon in this country, a phe-nomenon which is perpetuated and aug-mented by our failure to pass the fam-ily assistance plan this session. As therewas in ancient Rome at the beginningsof its decline, there is here an underclassof, if you will, \"proles\"\u2014a forgotten classof people to whom few respond, andabout whose anxieties fewer still trulycare. One sees it in the ghettos in myState\u2014the vacant stare, sometimes theferal stare, of the teenager on the stoopwho has dropped out of school, whosefamily is in dissolution, who has per-ceived oniy poverty and passivity all hislife\u2014the child and the teenager who htsa past which he wishes only to repress,a future he has no motivation to ailect.This is the child who becomes addictedto narcotics because he feels the needto withdraw from the only painful worldhe knows, the child who believes\u2014in a vicious self-fulfilling prophecy\u2014that hewill gi'ow UP to become nothing, the childwho can have no dreams.As bad as our present welfare crisis is,it will become far, far worse, for this un- derclass without hope will mature toswell the ranks of the impoverished, oswell the ranks of those who look uponwhat we see as the comfortable worldthrough windows of despair. They willhave children, and their children willhave children, in a seemingly never-end-ing cycle that expands the number ofthose who are shut out from society as we know it.Although the President's family assist-ance plan is inadequate in many respects,it does represent the first step towardmeeting that crisis of hopelessness. It isa step toward providing that underclasswith the social services requisite to bring-ing its members to the point that theycan begin to be motivated to improvethemselves. It is a step toward dignify-ing and helping the working poor, thoseyeomen of the American mythology whoare now motivated to make it within ourfree enterprise labor market, and whoare suffering for their efforts to meet ourideal and to feed their childi'en.FAP represents, in short, a beginningtoward restoration of the impoverishedinto the society of those who can dream,those who dare hope, those who will findthe strength to risk job training andwork. It is a beginning toward a trans-formation of that underclass into mem-bers of society.It is, then, essential that the next Con-gress make up its collective mind, forgood and all, that we cannot in consci-ence allow hunger in this land, that wecannot allow 5-year-olds in the ghettoesof Harlem and the hollows of Appalachiato attend miserable schools in clothes sotattered as to leave them exposed to thecold of the elements and the derision oftheir classmates, M income supplemen-tation bill must be passed in the nextCongress, and I pledge\u2014albeit from thesidelines\u2014to do my best to help bringthat about.Our existing welfare system has failedus.It discriminates among the poor,aiding some and ignoring others In awholly arbitrary fashion.Itprovides incentives only for idleness, dependenceand family breakup. Designed to savemoney instead of saving people, it tragi-cally ends by doing neither.The present welfare structure leavesthe amount of welfare benefits wholly tothe discretion of the States and localities.This has created a crazy patchwork, Inwhich benefit levels range from a highof $70 per month per child in New YorkCity to the shockingly low figure of $10per month per child in Mississippi. ThoseStates and localities that take their re-sponsibilities seriously are penalized byhigh welfare costs and growing welfarerolls, Those States and localities that donot, are rewarded by low welfare costsand succeed in exporting their poor.The principal existing Federal welfareprogram\u2014known as aid to families withdependent children\u2014is designed only toassist the unemployed mother who headsa family. It penalizes families that areintact. It ignores the working poor\u2014thoseeight million men, women and childrenwho live in families headed by someonewho works all year-round, but does notearn a livable income. These are thefamilies that have accepted Americanmiddle-class values, that have tried tofollow the vision of Horatio Alger, buthave not received their just due.The President's family assistance planwould for the first time, create a feder-ally established and federally financedminimum welfare assistance level. It thusrecognizes the essential principle that adestitute person should be entitled to anationally prescribed minimum of assist-ance, no matter where he lives. And Itrecognizes that only the Federal Gov-ernment has the fiscal resources to carry S 21340 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEDecember 29, 1970the main burden of welfare aid\u2014thatEtates and localities simply lack the re-sources to provide for their poor.The President's plan is designed to aidintact families and families of the work-ing poor. It makes a family's need thecrherion of assistance. Instead of penal-iing those that work, it creates new workincentives.These are far-reaching reforms. Theyare reforms of which the President canbe justly proud.I am convinced, however, that rtillmore must be done if we are to create awelfare system that is workable and fair.Welfare reform must build upon thePresident's proposals; it must, however,go beyond them to create a true sys-tem of national income maintenance.The administration proposal sets theFederal minimum welfare payment at$1,600 per year for a family of four.This is inadequate.It Is less than all but five of the ooorestStates are providing under the presentState-operated welfare system.It is less than half of the amount theSocial Security Administration defines asthe \"poverty level\"\u2014which is just under$3,800 year of four.This $3,755 \"poverty level\" figure con-stitutes the barest minimum needed forsubsistence. It is calculated on the basisof the Department of Agriculture's econ-omy food plan which according to theDepartment, is designed only for tem-porary emergency use, and is not a rea-sonable measure of the basic moneyneeds for a good diet.The respected Bureau of Labor Sta-tisticshas calculated a substantiallyhigher poverty line figure\u2014a little over$7,183 per year for a family of four. Thisis a more realistic estimate of the amountactually needed for subsistence.I believe we can do no less than to setthe Federal minimum welfare payment atthe $3,744 line. That is not a generousfigure. It is barely an adequate one. Bygoing below this amount, there is cleardanger of consigning welfare families tomalnutrition, inadequate clothing, slumhousing\u2014in short, to the most seriouspoverty and want.The administration plan covers onlyfamilies with minor children. Childlesscouples and single individuals- are ex-cluded. Still more Incongruous, a couplewith a 17-year-old child would lose theirbenefits the day the child turns 18.There is no justification for such dis-crimination among the poor. All per-sons below the poverty line should beeligible for assistance, regardless of theirmarital or family status.The Federal Government should as-sume the administration of the welfaresystem and operate it on the pattern ofthe social security system\u2014with writtenapplications, automatic mailing of pay-ments, and audit or spot cheeks for en-forcement purposes. State welfare agen-cies should be relieved of their role aswelfare policemen, and allowed to per-form their proper function of counsel-ing and assisting needy individuals.The administration bill requires allwelfare recipients, save those specificallyexempt, to accept \"suitable\" work when-ever available,as determined by theLabor Department.This is as impractical as it is offensive.A similar work requirement has beenin existence under the work incentiveprogram\u2014WIN\u2014of 1967, and it has beena spectacular failure. Of 600,000 welfarerecipients that qualified under this pro-gram by last year, only 100,000 were re-ferred for mandatory work or training\u2014and only 30,000, or 5 percent, actuallyfound jobs or training programs.In a time of rising unemployment, theprospects of success of a mandatory workrequirement are still more remote. Lawscannot force ,ieople to take jobs, if jobsare not available.A work requirement is demeaning. Ifjob openings are perceived asbeing worthwhile in terms of the income andthe personal satisfactions they provide,they will be filled voluntarily. If not, thenwe should be changing the nature of theopenings available. Dead-end jobs inevi-tably result in high turnover, and no legalcompulsion can change that fact.Above all, a work requirement punisheschildren for the actions ol their parents.It means that if the in.q,her refuses towork, the child will receive no aid, willbe brought up in the direst poverty, andwill ultimately become incapable of work-ing himself.In January 1968, President JohnsonappointedadistinguishedPresident's Commission on Income Maintenance, un-der the chairmanship of Ben Heineman,president of Chicago's Northwest Indus-tries. That Commission, with the aid ofan outstanding staff, reported to Presi-dent Nixon in November 1969. Its reportwas headlined in the New York Times,and hailed by virtually every academicexpert in the field. Unfortunately, thereport appeared after the administrationplan had already been made public. Asa result, it was shelved by the adminis-tration and never introduced in the Con-gress.The plan proposed by the HeinemanCommission seeks the administration'sobjectives while meeting the shortcom-ings of the administration bill.The Heineman plan moves toward aminimum income maintenance standardbased on the poverty level. It eliminatesthe categorical structure of the presentsystem, and provides universal coverageof all impoverished persons. It Federal-izes the welfare system and abandonsthe discredited inquisitorial concept ofwelfare. It provides a work incentive byallowing recipients to retain a part oftheir earned income, without imposing aharsh and unrealistic work requirement.The Heineman proposal provides foran annual adjustment of Federal incomemaintenance levels, designed to reflectthe changes in the cost of living. It elim-inates the food stamp program\u2014withits demeaning separate food lines at gro-cery stores\u2014and substitutes the cashneeded to buy food. It provides emer-gency relief for individuals struck bypersonal disasters and makes specialprovisions for those who earn seasonallyeratic incomes. None of these featuresare found in the administration bill.The Heineman Commission recom-mended that the Federal minimum wel-fare payment Initially set at $2,400 peryear for a family of four. This is some-what less than halfway between the ad-ministration's clearly inadequate pay-ment of $1,600 per year and the SocialSecurity Administration's poverty linefigure of just below $3,800 per year.The $2,400 figure is an arbitrary one,arrived by the Commission in recognitionof budgetary constraints. The Commis-sion recommended that the Federal min-imum payment be increased to the pov-erty level by 1975.It is my belief that any income sup-plementation plan passed should pro-vide an immediate maintenance level atthe poverty line, and should establish asa national objective income maintenanceat the Bureau of Labor Statistics' low-cost subsistence line.It should, moreover, include cost-of-living escalator based upon the annualmovement of this country's national me-dian family income, which is currentlycalculated by the Bureau of the Census.In accordance with the proposal of thedistinguished Senator from Iowa (Mr.MILLER), it should incorporate variationspursuant to regional cost-of-living fluc-tuations, which can be ascertained bythe Bureau of Labor Statistics.It should, finally, incorporate author-ization for payments to family units tomeet special needs of a unique or non-recurring nature, which needs are causedby temporary or unusual circumstancesthat render the unit unable to attainor maintain a decent standard of livingfrom the basic allowance. Those needsshould include but not be limited to thecost of clothing and furniture needed tobring the unit up to a decent standardat the time that it or any member there-of first becomes eligible for payments,the costs of replacing losses caused byfire, flood, or other natural disaster, andthe costs of meeting special medical, nu-tritional, or instructional needs whichare not provided for under title XIX ofthe Social Security Act.In accordance with the incentive sug-gested by both the Heineman Commissionand the President's family assistanceplan, a work incentive ought to be pro-vided by a negatively graduated mar-ginal tax rate for all those whose incomeis below the BLS low-cost level. If sucha work incentive is sufficiently negativelygraduated\u2014if the tax rate concentratesupon providing a 50 percent incentive tothose below the poverty line and providesa steeply decreasing incentive to thoseabove that line but below the BLS line\u2014then the cost of an income supplementa-tion plan similar to that of the HeinemanCommission comes out approximatelyequal to to that of the family assistanceplan.it is essential, moreover, that any in-come maintenance plan passed providesufficient day care services so that thoserecipients who choose to work or to trainfor a Job are not faced with the con-straint of a child left alone in the home.That day care should not be simply cus-todial, of no benefit to the child, butshould mandatorialy include an educa-tional component pursuant to the mini-mum standard of the Federal inter-agency day care requirements. December 29, 1970 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATE S 21341CONCLUSIONKarl Jaspers has said that,There exists between human beings\u2014be-cause they are human beings\u2014a solidaritythrough which everyone shares the respon-sibility for every injustice that is committedin the world. If I do not do all I can to pre-vent it, I share the guilt.The decision which we as a Nation willhave to make in the next 2 years iswhether, under the guise of budgetaryconstraints, we will accept either no in-come maintenance legislation at all or anadministration billthat is admittedlyinadequate to sustain living human be-ings, or whether we will shoot for theideal. We have become afraid, in thiscountry, to really care, because to reallycare has become unfashionable andrather laughable; and also, of course, be-cause to really care would impose uponus the necessity of acting in support ofthe things we really care for. It is in-cumbent upon us, nonetheless, to refuseto step back, to be cool, to accept theargwnent that there is just so much wecan do. It is our responsibility, indeed, tocare and to shoot for the ideal, to fulfillthat sacred obligation of which Jaspersspeaks.Despite the interest group conflicts,notwithstanding the political implica-tions of passage or nonpassage of thefamily assistance plan, the fact is thatthere is an underclass of the impov-erished in this country, and that wehave responsibility not only as legisla-tors, but also as human beings, to dosomething about it. Let me conclude withthe very opposite feelings of a fictionalpresidential candidate in Eugene Bu.r-dick's \"The 480\":We are told constantly, endlessly untilwe sicken of it, that 'things are compli-cated\" ...Ofcourse things are complicated.We can, If we wish, infatuate ourselves withcomplexity. We can fondle it in our hands,adore It, dazzle ourselves with it. But, in theend, we must realize that every situation canbe reduced to a simple decision: Do we act ornot? I! yes, in what ways?I trust that in the coming Congress wewill get to work early. I commend allthose who worked on this complicatedlegislation, and I trust that next yearthere will be established the principle ofincome maintenance, the principle thatwe are going to take care of the wretchedand the poor in this country. I commendto my colleagues that task, because Iknow they all desire this. It is going tobe difficult.I hope next year my colleagues will notfind themselves trying to deal with it inDecember. If they deal with it in Janu-ary, by December they should have afinal product.Mr. SCOT'F. Mr. President, I yield tothe Senator from Tennessee (Mr. BAKER)such time as he may desire.Mr. BAKER. Mr. President, I shall notunduly delay the Senate. I have a seriesof questions I would like to put to thedistinguished chairman, if I might. I amnot a member of the Finance Committee.I have followed the debate and the col-loquy with Interest during the severaldays this bill has been under considera-tion.I might say, as a preliminary to thefirst question, that I approve tl thrustand the design of the bill, especially asit relates to the automatic benefit in-crease section. A matter of parentheticalinterest to the junior Senator from Ten-nessee is that this is an item that I havelong favored, and in fact espoused 4 yearsago when I ran for the Senate.I put this question to the distinguishedchairman:It has been said that theautomatic benefit increase providad forin the social security bill could be fi-nanced without increasing the contribu-tion rates, provided the benefit and con-tribution base is increased as wages rise.Why then does the Senate bill providefor increasing both the base and thecontribution rate so that each increasewould meet one-half of the cost?Mr. LONG. The committee felt thatsince this would be a benefit increase tobe shared by all categories of benefici-aries, whether of low, middle, or highincome, all should share in paying forIt, since all would share in the benefits.In the alternative,if we raised therevenues solely by raising the amount ofwages taxed, then those at the upper endof the earnings range would have to paythe entire expenses of the benefit in-creases, even though workers at lowerearning levels would share in the in-creased benefits.The committee tiecided that since theIncreased benefits would be availablethroughout the whole spectrum of theincome levels, all income levels shouldpay for at least part of the cost of theincrease.Mr. BAKER. I thank the chairman forthat explanation, with which I entirelyagree.I might comment that a good bit hasbeen said, in the course of our considera-tion of the social security bill, about theprogressive nature of certain taxes, espe-cially the graduated Federal income tax,and the so-called regressive nature ofcertain other taxes, more often than notciting the fixed rate tax applicable tosocial security.I would point out, if I may, that thesocial security tax is progressive in asense, in that as the rate goes up, thereIs a tendency to shift the burden to high-er income taxpayers, while, in the alter-native, if we left the rate at the lowerlevel, it would tend to fix the burden onanother group of taxpayers.So it would appear to me that thecombination approach that the commit-tee adopted, and which the chairman hasnow explained, has all of the attributesof a tax of a progressive nature, ratherthan a regressive one. I am happy to hearit explained in that way.A further question: Would not theSenate provision for financing the auto-matic increases, to a greater extent thantheprovision passed by the House, dele-gate authority to the Secretary of HEW,In effect, to levy taxes?Mr. LONG. The provision the FinanceCommittee adopted would place uponthe Secretary of Health, Education, andWelfare a purely ministerial fuoction.All discretion would be left to Congrecs.If an Increase in benefits was triggercdwhen the cost of living went up by morethan 3percent, the Secretary wouldsimply do the arithmetic necessary tocalculate the amount that taxes wouldhave to be increased just enough to payfor the full cost of the increased bene-fits, no more and no less.Mr. BAKER. Maythen be reassuredon the proposition that the most ablestaff of the Committee on Finance isthoroughly convinced, as the chairmanmust be, that there is no abrogation ofthe taxing authority of Congress impliedin this discretion given to the HEWSecretary?Mr. LONG. That is right. All we havedone here is give him the responsibilityof doing the arithmetic necessary to ci-rive at the amount of the tax increase.Mr. BAKER. I ask the Senator fur-ther, while I have expressed my vh2le-hearted agreement with the concept ofcost-of-living increases as the cost of liv-ing goes up, which we hope will not co'-tinue indefinitely, might it not also besaid that there is no fair way to havecost-of-living increases except by thisroute?Mr. LONG. The committee so felt, andthat is why this is what the committeerecommended.Mr. BAKER. Mr. President, is not theeffect of the bill now pending before theSenate to obligate future Congresses toeither reduce taxes or raise benefits morethan the cost of living?Mr. LONG. No more so than under thepresent law. The committee bill recog-nizes that Congress may very well stayahead of the cost of living by passing in-creases which would make it unneces-sary for the automatic increases to gointo effect. If the Congress fails to acton benefit increases, then automatic In-creases would go into effect.Mr. BAKER. Mr. President, the nextquestion, and the last one, I might add,that I shall put to the distinguishedchairman, if he will grant me the addi-tional time and attention, would be this:Under this bill as now presented to theSenate, how high will the rates and thebase be in some future year in the me-dium distant future, say at the end ofthis century, in the year 2000, when to-day's young workers will be in their mid-fif ties arid beyond? Can the Senator givesome speculation on that aspect of thebill's impact?Mr. LONG. I would have to respondthat there is no real way of knowing,because basic and fundamental to thecommittee provision is the principle thatit will be Congress that will continue todetermine how much in the way of in-creases in social security would be jus-tifled tinder a given set of circumstances.In other words, it would be antici-pated that in the future, the Congresswould want to continue to increase so-cial security benefits.If that is the case, we would expectthat Congress would vote to pay for thehigher benefits. I know it is certainlythe view of the majority of the commit-tee at this time, and I would hope fu-ture Congresses would take the same at-titude, that with respect to the basicsocial security program, we would alwayspay for the program with taxes thatwould be levied. But I cannot say howmuch benefits will be increased In thefuture or what the level of taxable earn-ings will be\u2014that would merely be spec-ulation. S 21342Mr. BAKER. I recall a colloquy thedistinguished chairman of the Commit-tee on Finance had on this floor abouta year ago, in which he pointed out, andI agreed with him, that the basic socialsecurity program can easily be financedout of social security taxes on the baseas fixed from time to time, but the realquestion is whether Congress will usesocial security as a vehicle by which oth-er social services are delivered, where-upon we may be faced with the problemof deciding whether other sources thanthe social security tax should be used tofinance the cost of their delivery. Is thatbasically correct?Mr. LONG. Yes.Mr. BAKER. Mr. President, I thinkthe committee has done an excellent jobon a difficult problem, providing a billthat moves forward in the field of auto-matic increases in response to require-ments of the economy. The need is notpredictable for the year 2000, or theyear 1972, for that matter, but I thinkit is worthy of the favorable considera-tion of the Senate, and I wish, in theseclosing moments of the debate, to com-mend the committee and the staff forhaving done an excellent job.Mr. LONG. I thank the Senator.It was my judgment, Mr. President,that the Senate would pass as much ofthis committee bill as the Senate feltit could agree with, and could bring it toa vote, and that is what we have done.The committee recommended a $10 bil-lion bill, and the Senate is passing a $7.5billion bill.Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, will the Sen-ator from Louisiana yield to me?Mr. MANSFIELD. The Senator hascontrol of the time on that side.Mr. BAKER. Mr. President, the mi-nority leader yielded me such time as Imight require. I do not see him on thefloor. I am happy to yield to the Sena-tor from Kansas.Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I shall takevery littletime. I had a number ofamendments which were not offered be-cause hearings had not been held onthem. I should like, very briefly, to dis-cuss at least two amendments and makethem a part of the RECORD, SO that theymight be studied by Members of thisbody and byothers who may beinterested.One of the defects in the present SocialSecurity Act is the fact that there isunequal application of the program tohandicapped children under age 18.Presently, this age group is precludedunder aid to permanently and totallydisabled. Neither are provisions adequatefor benefits for disabled children underthe aid to families with dependent chil-dren program since eligiblity is based onthe economic status of the parent ratherthan the existence of disability in thechild.Children with severely handicappingconditions require extensive and costlyservices beyond the means of manyfamilies and an excessive financial bur-den to most.

Mr. President, anotherchange that has been called to my at-tention has to do with terminology.As Senators may know, last year thePresident apopinted a task force on thephysically handicapped. On that taskforce were many outstanding Americans,and they made many excellent recom-mendations. I have reviewed the rec-ommendations made by the President'stask force on the physically handicap-ped, and one of the recommendationsmade by the task force would amend title5 of the Social Security Act by replac-ing the term \"crippled children\" withDecember 29, 1970\"handicapped children.\" force, the term\"crippled child\" or \"crippled children\"as traditionally used in governmentalterms is too limited in its meaning andhas undesirable connotations, and pres-ent day services to crippled childrenshould include far more impairment cat-egories than ever before.I was advised by HEW that althoughthis amendment might appear to be de-sirable, they would oppose it if it wereoffered. Therefore, I chose not to offerthe amendment. According to HEW of-ficials,this would require changes bymany States in State laws and wouldperhaps cause some undue hardship atthe outset. But it has been studied care-fully, and it is the understanding of theSenator from Kansas that it will be givenserious consideration at a future time.Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-sent to have the proposed amendmentprinted at this point in the RECORD.There being no objection, the proposedamendment was ordered to be printed inthe RECORD, as follows:On page 540, after line 7 insert the follow-ing:\"CRIPPLED CHILDREN'S PROGRAM\u2014REDESIGNATEDHANDICAPPED CHILDREN'S PROGRAM\"SEc. 614. Title V of the Security ActIsamended bystrikingouttheword 'crippled' wherever It appears and substitut-ing In lieu thereof 'handicapped'.\"Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I should liketo ask the chairman of the committeea question. Under the bill as approvedby the Senate, what will be the excessof income over outgo for the social se-curity program as a whole over the next5 years?Mr. LONG. Mr. President, I say to theSenator that I regret that I do not haveit at this moment, but I can refer himto page 45 of our committee print, of myopening statement, which contained achart which shows that there will be asurplus of nearly $5 billion over the first3 years under the original committeebill. I regret that I do not have it avail-able for 5 years. But the surplus will becorrespondingly increased for the next2 years.Mr. DOLE. Then, the second part ofthat question: How much would thetrust funds have increased at the end of5 years as compared with increases un-der the present law?Mr. LONG. Mr. President, I have sub-mitted this chart elsewhere\u2014it com-pares income and outgo for 1971, 1972,and 1973 under both bills\u2014but I askunanimous consent that the chart I holdin my hand be printed at this point inthe RECORD.There being no objection, the chartwas ordered to be printed in the RECORD,as follows: PROGRESS OF THE OLD-AGE AND SURVIVORS INSURANCE, DISABILITY INSURANCE, HOSPITAL INSURANCE, AND CATA*'STROPH IC INSURANCE TRUST FUNDS, COMBINED, UNDER PRESENT LAW AND UNDER FINANCE COMMITTEE BILL 1971-73ICash basis; in billions of year\u2014197147.049.041.747.65.31.346.342.3 197250.055.344.253.35.71.952. 044.2 December 29, 1970Mr. LONG. The chart shows that, un-der present law, the trust fund in fiscalyear 1972 would rise to $51 billion, andunder the original committee bill it wouldrise to $44.9 billion. In calendar 1971.under the present law, $46 billion; underthe committee bill, $42.3 billion. In cal-endar 1972, under present law, $52 bil-lion; under the committee bill, $44.2 bil-.lion. In the presentlaw, $62.2 the committeebill, $47 billion. Of course, there havebeen certain modifications during floorconsideration of the committee bill whichwould change those figures to some de-gree.It was the judgment of the majorityon the committee that present law didnot adequately balance income and outgoin the next few years\u2014too much moneywould come in for the benefits beingpaid\u2014and we thought of this as a surplus, which we regarded to some degreeas constituting overfinancing that couldbe used to pay for further benefits.Mr. DOLE. Then, in the event thatthere were automatic benefit increases of3 percent each year over the next 5 years,there still would be some surplus in thetrust fund?Mr. LONG. The figures I have placedin the RECORD assume no increase in thecost of living. If the cost of living goesup, and benefits go up, the tax that iscollected goes up. When the cost of liv-ing goes up more than 3 percent, thetriggered increases go Into effect, and thetax rates go up, as well as the tax base,so that there Is just enough additionalincome to pay for all that. Thus, theamount being accumulated in the fundshould remain about the same even ifthere should be a cost-of-living benefitincrease.Mr. DOLE. I thank the chairman ofthe committee, and I thank the Senatorfrom Tennessee.Mr. YARBOROtJGH. Mr. President,after a lengthy and thorough debate onthe omnibus Social Security Act, HR.17550, I am very pleased that we wereable in these final hours to save thoseportions of the billthat will directlybenefit the lives of countless numbers ofsenior citizens who depend on socialsecurity and medicare to survive.The ever-increasing cost of living hitshardest those people in our society whomust depend on a fixed income, such associal security, to live. These people, whoare trapped by rising prices, are forced tosit helplessly by and watch the purchas-ing power of their small monthly incomedwindle away under the crush of run-away inflation. These older citizens haveno one but Congress to turn to for helpin these troubled times. The bill that theSenate has been able to agree to showsthat we are not going to let these citi-zens down.The most significant features of thisbill are:First. The 10-percent increase in socialsecurity benefits, Under tie Senate ver-sion of the bill, the over 26 millIon bene-ficiaries of social security will receive a10-percent Increase in benefits. This in-crease will be effective as of January1971 and will be paid to the people InApril. The bill also sets a new minimumCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014SENATEbenefit that can be paid of $100. Theoriginal House version of H.R. 17550would have increasedsocialsecurity benefits by only 5 percent and provideda minimum of benefits of $67.20. TheSenate version of this billis a muchsuperior measure and I hope the Housewill agree to the Senate's amendments.Second. The increase in the amount asocial security beneficiary can earn andstill receive his full benefits. The presentlaw sets a ceiling of $1,680 a year on theamount that a retired person can earnand still draw full social security bene-fits. This unreasonable work limitationhas forced many productive and creativecitizens into a state of forced idleness.Furthermore, this limitation, which isfar below the poverty line, locks many ofour older citizens into the low-incomebracket with no way of escape. Underthis bill, Congress is taking the first steptoward remedying this situation by in-creasingthe income limitation from$1,680 to $2,000. I supported an increaseto $3,200, which I believe would havebeen more reasonable. However, this in-crease included in H.R. 17550 does offera small measure of relief to our seniorcitizens who wish to work beyond theage of 65.Mr. President, I also commend theSenate Finance Committee for includingin the bill my amendqient to authorizethe Secretary of Health, Education, andWelfare to waive, in cases involvingsmall rural hospitals, the requirementthat a hospital furnish 24-hour regis-tered professional nursing services inorder to participate in the medicare andmedicaid programs.Under the present law, a hospital willnot be qualified to provide medicareservices if it does not maintain a regis-tered professional nurse on duty aroundthe clock 24 hours a day. This require-ment has imposed extreme hardships onthe small rural hospitals and clinics andthe people they serve. Many rural hos-pitals have been unable to find enoughregistered nurses who will move to therural areas to meet this 24-hour require-ment. As a result, many small hospitalsand clinics have been forced to close,leaving many of our citizens without thebenefit of a hospital near their homes.In short, this limitation in the medicarelaw is having the unfortunate effect ofdenying many of the citizens of ruralAmerica hospital care. My amendmentis designed to rectify this unjust situa-tion without lowering the standards forhealth care.Under my amendment, a rural hos-pital could obtain a waiver of the 24-hourregistered nurse requirement:First, the hospital has made, and iscontinuing to make, a good faith effortto meet the registered nurse requirement,but cannot because of nursing personnelshortage,Second, the hospital is located in anarea where hospital facilities are in shortsupply, andThird, the denial of medicare servicesat such a hospital will seriously limitthe availability of hospital care to thepeople of the area. This amendment is acarefully drawn measure which will pro-vide relief only In cases of true hard-S 21343ship. I am very pleased that the FinanceCommittee has recognized the urgentneed for this provision. It will insurethat medicare and medicaid benefits willbeavailabletothe peopleofrural America.Mr. President, in closing, I wish tocommend the distinguished chairmanof the Senate Finance Committee, Sena-tor LONG, and the members of his com-mittee for their hard work on this billand their willingness to work out a com-promise so that our senior citizens canbenefit from this bill. I urge all of mycolleagues to give this bill their full sup-port.Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. President, lastnight we spent many hours debating andvoting on provisions of the Social Se-curity Act, and expected to complete ourbusiness rapidly this morning. In par-ticular a number of us were concernedthat certain provisions, which we re-garded as restrictive, be dropped fromthe welfare programs. Senator HMUUS,you will recall, drafted a quick amend-ment to delete those sections of title Vwhich we believed would impose a hard-ship on the poor.At the time our concern was concen-trated on deleting those provisions andinadvertently,I failed to notice thatanother harmful provision was retained.In raising the payments for the aged,the blind, and the disabled to $130 foran individual and $200 for a couple, theFinance Committee had also removedthose individuals receiving cash assist-ance from eligibility for food assistance.Mr. President, the eligibility stand-ards for food assistance for such aged.blind, and disabled individuals are al-ready that high or higher in 34 States.Five of the remaining States have nofood stamp program,I believe we should not arbitrarily denyfood assistance to those who are poorbecause they are so old, so blind, or sodisabled that they are unable to providefor themselves. The parliamentary agree-ment does not permit another amend-ment to be considered now. But perhapsthis deficiency can be corrected by legis.-lative action next year. In any event, ifthere is any decrease in the cash allow-ances as provided by the Senate socialsecurity bill, I shall definitely make anall-out effort to add food stamp eligibilityfor the aged, the blind, and the disabled.

Under a,previous order of the House, the gentle-man from Ohio (Mr. VANIK) is recog-nized for 10 minutes.Mr. VANIK. Mr. Speaker, I have a pe-tition signed by 100 Members of theHouse of Representatives urging theHonorable WnBuR MILLS, chairman ofthe Ways and Means Committee to takethe Senate athendinents to the social se-curity bill from the Speaker's desk toconference and accept those which:First, Increase social security benefIts by10 percent; second, increase the socialsecnirlty minimum to $100; third, In-crease the retirement earnings test to$2,400; and fourth, Increase the monthlyminimum allowance for the aged, dis-abled, and blind on welfare to $130 aperson or $200 per couple.I can very well understand to act onthis bill while it languished in the otherbody for over 7 months. I also under-stand the frustrations of Members whoproperly explained about the attempt toattach nonrelated legislation to the so-cial security bill.These considerations, however, shouldbe put aside because of the need to adoptthis legislation. A new bill next year Isnot likely to provide a 10-percent in-crease in benefits, nor Is it likely to in-crease the minimum benefit to $100\u2014norIs It likely to Include an Increase In theallowable retirement Income to $2,400per year; nor Is it likely to increase themonthly minimum allowance f or the aged, disabled, and blind on welfare toacceptable levels. Furthermore, If a newbill passes the Congress by AprIl 1, In-creased benefit payments will not be re-ceived by 26 million recipients untilafter July 1.The experience of this year Indicatesthe manner in which the social securitylegislation is used as a delivery systemfor legislation which could not make Itthrough this Congress on Its own power.This abuse of the legislative processcould be avoided if we pass out a socialsecurity bill this session.Following Is the petition signed by 100Members of this body urging action be-foresinedieadjournmentofthis Congress.The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEFoLrr). Is there objection to the requestof the gentleman from Ohio?Mr. MILLS. Mr. Speaker, reserving theright to object, and I shall not object,of course, but I would think It would bethe gentlemaniy thing to do. and I amsurethose who signed thepetition would want done, and that Is to accordthe privilege to the chairman of theConunittee on Ways and Means the op-portunity to have the original copy ofIt and not just to read the signatures-into the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.Therefore, I hope my friend from Ohiowill provide that opportunity to thechairman of the committee.Mr. VANIK.

Vanik, Wil-liam Randall, herewith Is a Library ofCongress memorandum relating to thefinancing of the OASDI system under theDecember 81, 1970Senate version of the bill as comparedwith the House version:MEMORANDUMDECEMBER 29. 1970.Prom: Francisco Bayo.Subject: Comparison of the Financing of theOASDI System Under the Senate Ver-sIon and House Version of HR. 17550.The attached Table I compares the financ-Ing adopted for the Senate version and theHouse version of the OASDI system underHR. 17550. This comparison Is made on thebasis of level earnings assumptions and doesnot take into account the effect of the auto-matic benefit increase provisions or of theircorresponding financing. The House versionof these provisions Is estimated to yieldenough revenues, over the long-range future,to finance eli the automatic Increases inbenefits. However, under the Senate versionof the automatic provisions the system wouldslowly accumulate actuarial surpluses, un-less the Congress acts in the future to eitherincrease the benefits further or reduce thetaxes.On the basis of the level earnings assump-tion and disregarding the automatic provi-sions, the House bill has an actuarial im-balance for the OASDI system of \u20140.15%taxable payroll which is close to the permis-sible variation of .10% of taxable payroll.This was also the case under the Ways andMeans Committee bill, which had an actu-arial balance of \u20140.12% of taxable payrolland which was Increased on the House floorto \u20140.15% of taxable payroll by a liberaliza-tion in the retirement test. However, this isnot the case for the Senate bill which has anactuarial imbalance of \u20140.25% of taxablepayroll and is beyond the acceptable limitsof variation. It should be indicated that thebill reported by the Senate Finance Commit-tee had an actuarial balance of \u20140.15% oftaxable payroll, as In the House bill, and thatthe liberalization adopted on the Senate floorwith respect to the earnings test and tograndchildren's benefits increased the im-balance by 0.10% to a total of \u20140.25% of tax-able payroll.The main differences between the two ver-sions of the bill are presented in Table IIwhich also indicates their long range costeffect. The level-cost of the OASDI systemunder present law and under both versions ofthe bill are presented in Table UI.

December 81, 1970 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD HOUSE 1112619 SOCIAL SECURITY ACT AMEND-MENTSThe SPEAKER pro tempore. Under aprevious order of the House, the gentle- 1112620 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEDecember 31, 1970man from Arkansas (Mr. MILLS) is rec-ognized for 10 minutes.Mr. MILLS. Mr. Speaker, I want totake time first to thank my friend, thegentleman from Ohio (Mr. VANIK), forall of his valuable assistance in trying tohelp me work out, along with other Mem-bers who would have been on the con-ference committee, these many knottyproblems that we would have if we wentto conference. His assistance is appreci-ated. And I am sure if we were in con-ference and could be in communicationwith the gentleman with respect to eachof the 295 amendments that the Senateadopted to the bill, raising the size of thebill from 158 pages initially to an even400 pages, that we could get some veryvaluable direction from the gentleman inmaking decisions as to what the Houseconferees should be expected to do oneach of these amendments.How long this would take, however, in-sofar as receiving that consultation andadvice and then making a decision onthe part of those of us who would be theconferees, I do not know. But I think thegentleman has been in the Congress longenough, I think he has been on the Com-mitteeonWaysandMeanslong enough\u2014maybe he has not attendedenough conferences to know\u2014that it ishumanly impossible within a short pe-riod of time to go to conference, handpick four or five things out of a bill thatthe gentleman wants us to have, andcome back with those four or five things,and turn down the remainder in the con-ference and get the other side to agree.You know, a conference is a compro-mise between representatives of this bodyand of the other body. I have neverknown of a time when the other bbdyjust capitulated on the basis of sugges-tions that the gentleman from Wiscon-sin (Mr. BYRNES) and I, and other Houseconferees would say what we wanted onthe House side, because invariably theytell us that Senator So-and-So has amost important amendment in this bill,and we just could not go back to theSenatewithoutSenatorSo-and-so'samendment adopted in the conference\"for fear that he would engage in whatis referred to over there as 'unlimiteddiscussion' on the weaknesses of the con-ference report without 'my' provision init.\"That has happened invariably withrespect to every one of these so-calledChristmas tree bills that the House hasbeen presented with over the years, usu-ally before Christmas, you understand,Mr. Speaker, but this one did not passthe Senate until December 29.Actually, there were so many errorsin it after passage in the other body thatit actually took two prints and two re-visions by the enrolling clerks, or who-ever does it, in order to put the bill insome form that they could submit tothe House. It has taken over 2 work-ing days of the Government PrintingOffice and the enrolling clerks in theSenate to get out this 400-page docu-ment for the House. Now, nobody knowsyet whether it is perfect or not, even asfar as the clerical condition is concerned,but we do know we did not get it untiltoday.And as I look at my calendar it seemsto me that today is the 31st day of De-cember, is it not?Now, I took the occasion this after-noon, after I received the print\u2014be-cause of the interest of my friend, thegentleman from Ohio, in something be-ing done, and also my own interest\u2014just to run through some of these things,and see just what the Senate had donethat he, on yesterday, recommended soquickly when he sent a letter to every-body in the House saying that he ac-knowledgedthattheseweregood amendments, and stating in the firstparagraph of his letter to all of his dearcolleagues, dated December 31:Today the House will receive\u2014And it did not, but he said it would\u2014the Senate-passed Social Security Act witha requestfora conference. The Senateamendments to this bill merit adoption bythe House en bloc. There is no need for aconference and delay.Now, I hope my friend has changedhis mind, because there are provisionswithin the Senate bill' that my friendfought in the House Committee on Waysand Means when they were being dis-cussed. For example, my friend wouldnot be for a suggestion that the Secre-tary of Health, Education, and Welfarebe directed to levy against any and allproperty that any person might havewho happened to owe money to the medicare program. Surely not.The gentleman opposed that in theCommittee on Ways and Means, but thegentleman asked me yesterday to justproceed to take the bill with that kindof an amendment in it.Another provisionthat my friendsurely would not want Is one in an effortto do, I think, a very implausible thing:subsidize employers to employ the hardcore, giving a tax break of such naturethat it is profitable to the employer tofire his long-time unionized members,and go to nothing but so-called hard-core employment.That Is one thing I have always beentold by my friencic In organized labor,that they feared and did not want to seehappen in connection with any of thesetraining programs.Now that is another provision which,had I followed the gentleman's adviceand taken the bill from the Speaker'stable and adopted the Senate amend-ments engross or in block, we would havehad in this bill.'But the most serious part of It all really Is here again\u2014the irresponsibilityof the matter. And I say this advisedly.It makes one's patience wear thin, whenwe have this sort of situation on a billwhich reaches us on December 31 in theafternoon, which has 295 amendments,covering 268 pages of new provisions,which we were asked to accept even be-fore the language of the amendmentswas available.One thing that has happened everytime the Committee on Ways and Meanshas acted on social security, and I wishmy friend, the gentleman from Wiscon-sin, if I am wrong will correct me, theCommittee on Ways and Means his-torically and certainly ever since I havebeen a member, and that goes back to1942, has studiously acted to prevent thisfund from ever becoming actuarially un-sound.We have never allowed such a bill topass with our support even though everytime, I may say without exception, wehave had to patch it up in conferenceto prevent Senate amendments frommaking it actuarially unsound. We pre-sented a bill to the President, which wassound, and we could say to the Americanpeople that it was actuarially sound, andwe have maintained the integrity of thecongressional position that you may relywith certainty upon these monthly pay-ments when you are in retirement.This bill, as we have it before us, is outof balance by 0.25 percent of payroll. Nowthat does not sound like very much doesit? But what does 0.25 percent of pay-roll represent in dollars? That representsover $1 billion a year. We do not haveenough in the fund to run the risk ofspending more money within the life ofthe fund\u2014more money than we can takein on an actuarial basis.Now I could ask the gentleman to helpme with respect to extending a lot ofthese other provisions, but I am not go-ing to because I know now that my frienddoes not want us to take all of this. Hehas had a chance to know more aboutwhat is in the bill\u2014and I am not criticiz-ing him. I know that he has this zeal tohelp people. I have it myself. But if hewill be patient with me and not be tooanxious, and will let me go over someof these things with him and advise withhim ahead of time, I may be able to helphim to avoid making a mistake in thisarea because I have had some experiencethat he has not had an opportunity tohave that I am sure my friend could use.What I am talking about is this.No one has spent more time, in myopinion, working in this field In the ef-fort to help people than the membershipof our committee, In total, over all ofthese many years. I know I have spenta lot of time thinking about this. I havebeen proud of the fact that the benefitsunder social security have risen; and thatthe fund has grown more; the programhas meant more during the period oftime I have been on the committee, andmay I say even during the period of timeI have been chairman of the committee,than in all of the history of the programtheretofore. I have taken great pride Inthat. It is a pleasure for me to have beenthe author of so many of the bills thathave helped the program to go in this di-rection.But I urge my friends who are peti-tioning me through the gentleman fromOhio (Mr. VANIK) to be a little patientwith us\u2014and I know that we will not doall that they ask of us, and I say that inall frankness\u2014but I have a lot moreoptimism about the whole operation thanmy friend has. I am not a pessimist likehe is.I have said, and the gentleman fromWisconsin has said, and every memberof the Committee on Ways and MeanEwith whom I have discussed the matterhas agreed with me that there will bereported from the Committee on Wayaand Means as soon as possible after we December 31, 1970 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSE H 12621reconvene a billwhichwill provide so-cial security benefit increases across-the-board retroactive to January 1. The bene-fits in this bill would go Into effect then.It would be my intention that the billwould provide for those things that theHouse provided for in the social securitymeasure insofar as outside earnings areconcerned. We cannot go to the $2,400,without making our billas actuarilyunsound as the Senate bill is, except thatwe should increase taxes\u2014and I do notknow whether we want to do that ornot\u2014but what I would like to do is toreport back a bill without a whole lot ofdiscussion and a whole lot of divisivenesson the part of the committee, as quicklyas we can. In my opinion, hearings arenecessary, I am sure my friend wouldagree. I think if we do that and makesuch adjustments as we want to withrespect to the percentage across-the-board increase in benefits and let theHouse know that the bill that it votedon last year Is similar to the bill thatwe are asking it to vote on next yearwith these exceptions that we will de-scribe, the bill would go through byunanimous consent,The SPEAKER pro tempore. (Mr. FOLEY). The time of the gentleman fromArkansas has expired.(By unanimous consent, at the requestof Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin, Mr. MILLSwas allowed to proceed for 5. additionalminutes.)Mr. MILLS. I thank the gentleman.The bill could pass by unanimous con-sent, In all probability. There is no rea-son why we cannot do it by Lincoln'sBirthday, if we get the House organized.I would like to repeat: if we get theHouse organized in time. I, of course, donot know whether we can do it. I do notknow what the caucus is going to imposeupon us in that respect. They may makeIt Impossible for us, If we are not careful,to organize the House In a short periodof time, It may take us the month ofFebruary, But if It does not, we can, asthe Ways and Means Committee, meetand report this bill out, in my opinion,In a short time at the most and have Itpassed.So I say I am far more optimistic thanmy friend from Ohio Is. I am surprisedthat he is so pessimistic,. and I hope hewill not go home and go to bed tonightwithout that degree of optimism aboutthis that I have.Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin. Mr. Speak-er, will the gentleman yield?Mr. MILLS. I yield to the gentlemanfrom Wisconsin.Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin. I thinkthere are others who share the chair-man's optimism, and certainly there arepeople who are as concerned about thewelfare of these people as Is the gentle-man from Ohio, the gentleman from Ar-kansas, or myself. I refer to the NationalCouncil of Senior Citizens, Inc.If the chairman would permit, I wouldlike to call to the attention of the gentle-man from Ohio a letter that they sentto the chairman of the committee andalso to myself as the ranking member,and this was done some time ago, ac-knowledging the Impracticality of goingto a conference.Certainly, if the proposition the gen-tleman suggested yesterday had beenpresented, they would have been equallyshocked\u2014the Idea that we should justaccept the Senate amendments en bloc.] could not help but be breathless at thepreposterousness of such a propositionIa abdicating the responsibilities of theHouse and the responsibilities of theWays and Means Committee,Now today the gentleman presents uswith a new proposition, and that is tofollow this very selective method.But let me read what the NationalCouficil of Senior Citizens wrote to thechairman and myself with respect tothe matter at hand:NArIONAL COJNCTL SENIORCITIZENS, INC.,Washington, D.C., December 1970.Eon. Wztuii D. MILI.s,Chairman Committee Ways and Means,U.S. Representatives, Washing-ton, D.C.DEAR WILBuR: This morning's press car-ried a story to the effect that you and Con-gessman Byrnes had issued a joint state-Irent dealing with the practical impossi-b:llty of any House-Senate Conference corn-peting action during this session on Hit.l'550, even in the unlikely event that theSenate could act on this legislation betweennow and the end of this Congress.Let me say that we in the National Coun-ciL of Senior Cltizen were relieved to learnof this position taken by you and the rank-ing minority member. We have been con-cerned during the last several weeks lest theSenate might be pushed by the time factorinto some hasty action On this complex andfar-reaching piece of legislation and that aHouse-Senate Conference would be con-fronted with the task of reconciling the twomsasurea made enormously more complex byal:, of the changes made in the biU as re-pcrted by the Senate Finance Committee. Itis our view that the position that you andCcngressman Byrnes have taken and yourmaking the position pubUc represents a re-sp)nsible approach to the problem at thisstage and we are grateful for It.We were glad to note also that the state-mont as reported Indicated your readinessto consider Improvements In the Social Se-curity and Welfare programs early in thefir;t session of the new Congress and thatyou expected that increases in Social Se-..c*xrity benefits would be made retroactive toJa.iuary 1. If you are successful In these ef-fot ts, the elderly will not have suffered anyovorall loss of benefits, though so many ofthom are Uving on the very edge of the mar-gir. that even delays in receiving benefit in-creases are very serious. Any such delay,hoFever, would not be nearly as harmful totim elderly of this country as the effects ofhaity and UI-considered legislation might be.In connection with the new pepposals inbenefits, we hope that the Ways and MeansCommittee will recognize that since the verymodest increase of five percent passed theHojse early this year, It has already beenused up by the effects of the Inflationary risein the cost of living which hits the elderlyon fixed Incomes the hardest. We would urgetherefore that as you approach this problemIn he new year you would consider substan-tially greater Increases In the benefit sched-ule; than those In the House-passed bill of1973.With the season's best wishes, I amSincerely yours,NELSON 11. CRUUC5HANK,President.That is the position the Chairman Istaking, and It Is the position I havetaken, that we are here dealing with atrust we have that involves the futurefloor of protection for all the older peopleand the people who are working today,and that 20-some million who are de-pendent on this system. We cannot takerisky action, we cannot take precipitousaction, we cannot take ill-considered ac-tion if we are going to do justice by therights of these people and their depend-ents under this system.I compliment the chairman with ,re-spect to the position he has taken in ourdealing with this legislation and with re-spect to the bill as it has come over fromthe Senate.Mr. VANIK. Mr. Speaker, will the gen-tleman yield?Mr. MILLS. I yield to the gentlemanfrom Ohio.Mr. VANIK. Mr. Speaker, I would liketo say I never intended to imply thatwhat the other body prepared for us wasa perfect bill. We have had many imper-fect bills sent to us from the other body.There has been the trade bill, that in-cluded oil quotas and everything eiseunder the suit that could be hooked ontoit.I know neither the distinguishedChairman nor the distinguished rankingminority member of the Ways and MeansCommittee can tell me and assure thisHouse that the social security bill willnot again be used as a delivery systemfor the kind of conglomerate legislationthat could not pass this House on its own.The SPEAKER. The time of the gen-tleman from Arkansas has expired.(On request of Mr. VANIK, and byunanimous consent, Mr. MII.LS was al-lowed to proceed for 2 additional min-utes.)Mr. VANIK, Mr. Speaker, I would liketo say I have always supported the in-tegrity of this fund. As a matter of fact,I opposed the language of the House bill,and I cannot tell the gentleman rightnow whether It Is in the Senate bill, thelanguage reducing the tax rate or Sus-pending the increase that was alreadyprovided In the law to take effect Jan-uary 1.And by that very provision they havediverted over $40 billion out of the trustfund during the next 10 years. I opposedthat diversion in the House bill, as thegentleman knows.I just want to say In closing on thispoint that It is not my patience that isat issue, and It Is not the patience ofour distinguished Chairman of the Waysand Means Commttee that is at issue, butit is the patience of the 26 million peopleplus the great body of other people thatare affected by the other provisions ofwhat the Senate has suggested In thefour proposals I have made.I certainly hope, with every hope thatI can muster, that what we do next yearwill approach the high degree of serviceand accomplishments that is suggestedby the four proposals I have asked theHouse Ways and Means Committee toadopt.Mr. MILLS. If I have a minute or twoleft, I will say to the gentleman I do notlike his fourth proposal either, becausethe House proposal of providing $220 tothe couple as a minimum payment isbetter to me than the Senate's providing$200 per couple, but the gentlemait will 1112622have a chance to 'dote further in thecommittee on it if he wants. I will notvote for it. I will vote for the more liberalprovision the House will provide. I hopemy friend from Ohio, on more reflection,will also.But what I want to get my friend tounderstand\u2014and I had thought the gen-tleman had been in Congress long enoughnever to accept a proposal from theother body with respect to a bill this big,to understand that never should any-body take such a package, and neverrecommend to one's colleagues again thatthe amendments should be taken en blocuntil the gentleman himself has had achance to study them and read them.Never in my years of dealing with theSenate have I ever known that body toproduce anything and send it here, neverhave I ever had to go to conference withthem on something that I have taken enbloc. I have never done it. I will ask thegentleman from Wisconsin If he has everknown of a major product coming fromthat body which we have had to meet onthat he would take en bloc?This is what I want to caution myfriend about, because I do not want himto make a mistake again If he stayshere\u2014and I think he will, because he isa valuable and able Member\u2014but I cau-tion my friend, the gentleman, just donot make that mistake.The SPEAKER pro tempore. The timeof the gentleman from Arkansas. hasagain expired.(By unanimous consent, Mr. MILLSwas allowed to proceed for 2 additionalminutes.)Mr. VANIK. Mr. Speaker, will the gen-tleman yield?Mr. MILLS. I yield to my friend fromOhio.Mr. VAN]X. I just want to say I cer-tainly hope that the distinguished chair-man and the ranking minority memberof the Ways and Means Committee andother Members of this House will helpus adopt rules that will make it possiblefor the other Members of this body bet-ter to see a bill that they vote on thatis reported out of a conference.I have to go to the Speaker's desk toread the amendments, because under thearchaic procedure under which we oper-ate today a conference report comingover from the other body is almost secretto most of the Members of the House.They have no way of knowing totallywhat is going on in the legislative proc-ess, not only at this stage of a legislativesession but also at any stage of a legisla-tive session.Mr. MILLS. Would my friend yieldback to me?Mr. VANIK. Certainly.Mr. MILLS. Now, do not castigate usany more about conference reports andthings like that.I have never brought up a conferencereport during the time I have been chair-man of the committee which has not beenprinted and available to every Memberof the House who wanted to get it beforeit was ever considered. All a Member hasto do is to ask for it and read it.The gentleman asked me, though, yes-terday, to take a bill that was not evenover here, which had not even beenCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014- HOUSEprinted by the Government Printing Of-fice, and to accept all the amendmentsen bloc. It did not become available toanyone until today. But the gentlemansent his letter out yesterday.If the gentleman wants to criticize usabout conference reports, do not do thatany niore, please.Mr. VANIK. I want to point out thatno Member of this House had access tothat volume prepared by the other bodyunless he went to that desk. I believe therules ought to be changed.Mr. MILLS. It was not there. What Iam trying to tell the gentleman is thatthe engrossed copy arrived today\u2014I re-peat, today\u2014at the Speaker's desk, andI could not get a copy of this until today,which represents the bill as amended bythe Senate, and the ink is not even dryon it now. No ohe could get a copy be-cause it was not in print.Mr. VANIK. I want to point out to mydistinguished chairman, I thought thereport would be delivered the day before.They personally told me in the otherbody it would be delivered.Mr. MILLS. What I am trying to cau-tion my friend\u2014and to get my friend tosee the wisdom of my advice\u2014is not toLend out a letter until he has had an op-portunity to analyze and to know whatis in the proposition he is asking theHouse to take. That isallI ask. Heshould not have sent out the letter onthe basis of the bill having been sent tothe House. He should have sent out hisletter, in my opinion, on the basis of anactualexamination and an indepthstudy of the amendments, because nowI do not know whether in the futureI want to go along with his recommen-dations that I do something or not, be-cause I just will not know how far intothe subject he has gone. That is whatworries me.The SPEAKER pro tempore. The timeof the gentleman from Arkansas hasagain expired.(By unanimous consent, Mr. MILLSwas allowed to proceed for 1 additionalminute.)Mr. VANIK. Mr. Speaker, willthegentleman yield?Mr. MILLS. I yield to the gentlemanfrom Ohio.Mr. VANIK. I just want to point out tothedistinguished chairmanthat no Member of this House had access to thisbill at all until it was brought to theSpeaker's desk. In my letter I assumedit was going to be brought over yester-day. That is the reason why the lan-guage was in the letter. But that is onlya small part of the controversy I raisetoday.Mr. MILLS. Pardon me, but there is nocontroversy between the gentleman andme. We are both trying to do the samething, to help the old people.Mr. VANIK. I just want to say, in con-cluding my remarks, I certainly hope andtrust that the goals we both aspire forand aim for with respect to our socialsecurity program will be adopted in timenext session to make it a realistic andearly payout to the 6 million people whoare involved some time before April 1.Mr. MILLS. I just want the gentlemanto be optimistic, to be in the committee.December 31, 1970like he is, and to see to it that it is done,But be optimistic about it, I say to myfriend.Mr. CORMAN. Mr. Speaker, will thegentleman yield?Mr. MILLS. I yield the gentlemanfrom California.Mr. CORMAN. I thank the gentlemanfor yielding.I notice in the proposal of the gentle-man from Ohio we are dealing with twosubject matters, although both deal withthe old people. One is the social securitybenefit and the other is public assistance.I understand from the chairman thatwe may move rather rapidly into thiswhole field. It is my own feeling thatwhen we talk about public assistance,people who are poor and may be hungry,we are talking about people who are tooold to work, too sick to work, and tooyoung to work. Am I to anticipate we willtake care of all those people at the sametime, since there are little resources inthe States to pay their portion of thecost of this?It seems we must not exclude any por-tion of the poor when we finally decidewhat the Federal Government wants todo and what we will attempt to get theStates to do.Mr. MILLS. I will state to the gentle-man that if I had not already made thatobservation, I should have done so. Wedo not want Just a social security bill.What we would want, if I could have myway in the matter, would be a combina-tion of such matters as we have beentalking about; namely, social securityamendments,medicareamendments,medicaid amendments, welfare amend-ments, which would include the AF'DCprogram and any changes in that area,and also your adult assistance, whichapplies to the aged, to-the disabled, andto the blind, so that we will have a com-plete package in one bill,Mr. CORMAN. Mr. Speaker, I appre-ciate the comments of the chairman. ButI would rather, when we look at thistotal picture of assistance, believe thefirst thing involved Is what the bene-ciaries are to get and how much out ofthe total amount of resources will bedevoted to these programs; how muchthe Federal Government is going to putin the pot and how much the State andlocal governments will put in.Further, with regard to the FederalGovernment contribution,it comes intwo forms. One form is general fundsand the other form is from social secu-rity. We are always tempted to raise itto a rather high level, the minimum ofsocial security, depending upon public as-sistance, but in truth if you do that youthen cut back on the amount of moneyyou have to give as benefits to socialsecurity recipients who have paid a sub-stantial amount of money over a longperiod of time. So, in truth you rob theworkers to obtain the expenditures forthe benefits you might otherwise nothave.Mr. MILLS. I think the gentlemanfrom California Is eminently correct.Mr. Speaker, let me say this in con-elusion: I regret that I had to conclude,along with the gentleman from Wiscon-sin (Mr. BYRNES), because of the time December 31, 1970 CONGRESSIONALRECORD \u2014HOUSEII 1262elements involved, that it would be anidle gesture and that it would be impos-sible for us to accomplish anything bygoing to conference. Therefore, you haveto conclude that it would have been in-advisable to take the bill from the Speak-ers table and engage in an idle gestureof asking unanimous consent for it to goto conference and die in the conference.I would rather that we not go throughany such idle gesture here but recognize.all of us, just because we may at thisparticular session of the 91st Congresshave lost a battle, it does not mean wehave lost the war. I have received lettersand telegrams from a number of organi-zations representing our older citizenscommending us on our decision on thismatter. There will be another Congresseither on January 4 or January 21 orsometime next year\u2014the beginning ofthe 92d Congress\u2014and I can assure allof my colleagues, as I have said to myfriend, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.VANIK), with reference to the timing ofthis bill, It is my Intention to move thebill as quickly as is possible and I haveno thought ofletting anything thatmight develop interfere with the carry-ing out of that purpose insofar as I cancontrol it. Now, certainly, I know thatmy friend has confidence in me, as Ihave in him, and I know I can join himand I know he joins me in wishing a veryhappy New Year to all of those who arehere as well as our colleagues who arenot here, but certainly to those who haveremained here long enough to hear thegentleman from Ohio and the gentlemanfrom Arkansas settle this matter.The SPEAKER pro tempore. The timeof the gentleman from Arkansas hasagain expired. 91ST CONGRESSS.2986 INTHE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES OCTOBER 2, 1969Mr. SCOTT (for himself, Mr. BRUOKE, Mr. Do1INIc1, Mi.

Mr. President, I intro-duce on behalf of myself, and other Sen-ators, \"The Family Assistance Act of1969,\"comprehensivelegislationad- dressed to one of our most serious do-mestic problems. This bill constitutes oneof the most important domestic Initia-tives which the Nixon administration willundertake. It embodies the administra-tion's proposals for a complete overhaulof our present, highly usisatisfactorywelfare system. President Nixon did notoverstate the case when he termed thewelfare system a colossal failure and ahuge monster. No one is happy with wel-fare as it now exists\u2014neither the tax-paying American, administrators at theFederal, State, and local levels of gov-errunent, nor the recipients themselves.Most of the problems In the existingsystem center around the program knownas AFDC\u2014aid to families with dependentchildren. In a period of Increasing pros-perity, and decreasing unemployment,this program has grown steadily. Since1960, its cost has tripled, and the numberof recipients has more than doubled. Thisprogram Is now responsible for paymentsto 6,500,000 persons. Yet this programIs basically unfair. It is unfair to menwho work hard for low wages. It Is un-fair to families that stay together, In-stead of breaking up. It Is unfair to peo-ple who live in different States, some ofwhom receive a payment of $39 a month,and others of whom receive as much as$163 a month.After a great deal of study, the admin-istration has concluded that the best wayto remedy these problems is to establisha uniform Federal payment\u2014a familyassistance payment\u2014to families withchildren and with comparable amountsof Income. This Is not a guaranteed in-come program. Persons who do not ac-cept work or training opportunities willDot be eligible for payments. it is a pro-gram that guarantees that help will beavailable for any family, with children,where the breadwinner uses his best ef-forts. It Is designed as a program to en-courage people to help themselves. TheIncentives to have earnings, and to In-crease earnings, are large.Under this plan, the basic benefit fora family with no Income would be $500for each of the first two persons In thefamily, and $300 for each additional one.Thus, in the case of a family of fourwithout income, payments of $1,600 an-nually would be available. The first$720\u2014based on $60 a month\u2014of annualearnings, would not result in any reduc-tion In the basic family assistance bene-fit. This would ordinarily cover the ex-penses of employment so that an indi-vidual would Dot be disadvantaged bygoing to work. Above this level, a dollarof earnings would result in only a 50-cent reduction In benefits. For each dol-lar of unearned Income, there would beonly a 50-cent reduction, thus providinga monetary Incentive for child support,and for more stable work effort by Indi-viduals so that higher unemploymentcompensation benefits would be avail-able.October 2, 1969The food stamp program which wasproposed by the President, and for whichlegislation has now been passed by thisbody, will enhance the benefits available.The comprehensive manpower and train-ing bill will make more available trainingopportunities In relation to local labormarkets, and the opportunity for place-ment of welfare recipients in the type oftraining program most likely to fit themfor available jobs. This bill will comple-ment both programs. With regard to thelatter, this bifi provides funds to help de-fray training costs, and it vastly ex-pands\u2014comparedwithpresentpro-grains\u2014the authority for day care. Anyunemployed person who Is able to workor take training will be required to regis-ter with the State employment services.An exception Is made In the case ofmothers of children under 6 whose ac-ceptance of training or employment isvoluntary.Under the existing system there is, asI pointed out, a very wide variation Inpayments. It would be unfair to signifi-cantly reduce the amount of assistancebeing received by individual families to-day. This bill, accordingly, contains pro-visions for State supplementation so thatpersons will not lose under the new ar-rangement. Obviously, the intact work-Ing families who are eligible for nothingtoday will gain, and greater equity willresultIn the program for the aged, blind, anddisabled, Federal matching Is materiallyImproved.TheFederalGovernmentwould provide 100 percent of the first $50of payment per IndIvidual, 50 percent forthe next $15, and 25 percent of theamount above $65. Of vital Importanceis the principle of a minimum incomefloor that would be established for thefirst time. As a condition for receivingFederal grants, the States would have toassure that each aged, blind or disabledindividual would have at least $90 fromhis assistance payment and other Incomeeach month.The bifi has been designed to assuresome fiscal relief under the welfare pro-grams as compared with existing law. Itincludes provisions that the Federal Gov-ernment will reimburse the States forany required non-Federal expendituresthat exceed 90 percent of what their ex-penditures would be under existing law.At the same time, other provisions assurethat States will expend at least one-halfas much as they are spending at presentThese provisions, coupled with the reve-nue-sharing proposals of this adminis-tration,willaidhard-pressedState treasuries.Out of new expenditures of approxi-mately $5 billlon\u2014$4 billion under thebill that I have Introduced and $1 billionof direct revenue sharing\u2014the savings toState treasuries is estimated at $1.7 bil-lion, one-third of the total. The remain-ing expenditures will go primarily to therecipients of family assistance payments,for training costs and day care and foradministration and other Items.The bill makes mlntmfi.1 changes in theexst1ng provisions for social services tofamilies. This, I unders.nd, will be thesubject of later proposals. Similarly, the October 2,1969billmakes only minirnai changes In themedicaid program which Is now underintensive review by the Department ofHealth, Education, and Welfare.Mr. President, the welfare proposalscontained In this bill are designed to cor-rect four basic evils In the present sys-tem\u2014evils which provide strong incen-tivesforabuse.Itcorrects theevil inequities between male and female-headed families which today provide anIncentive for them to leave home. It cor-rects the inequities today between theidle and the working poor which pres-ently provide an incentive for idleness.It requires recipients to ccept availablework or training and provides expandedtraining in day care services to make thispossible.Mr. President, this bill is long; it iscomplex. Not all may agree with thedetails of every provisiion. Certain re-finements may be suggested in commit-tee, and on the floor. Yet, overall, I be-lieve these proposals constitute a majorImprovement In the way in which wedeal with one of our most troublesomeproblems. They warrant fully the mostcareful consideration by all of us, lead-ing to enactment.For the first time since the 1930's theemphasisInFederalprogramshas shifted from the merely custodial to theremedial.President Nixon recognizesthat the Federal dole is demeaning tohuman dignity, and only encourages acycle of dependence from one generationto the next. This bill is vitally essentialto the successful Implementation of hisstated goal to \"assist millions of Ameri-cans out of poverty and Into produc-tivity.\"I am pleased to have joining me as co-sponsors In this effort the following dis-tinguished Senators:Mr. GRIFFIN ofMichigan, Mr. BROOKE of Massachusetts,Mr. DOMINICK of Colorado, Mr. HANSENof Wyoming, Mr. PROUTY of Vermont, Mr.SCHWEIKER of Pennsylvania, Mr. STEVENSof Alaska, Mr. JAVIS of New York, andMr. PERCY of fllinois.Mr. President, I ask that an explana-tory statement by Health, Education, andWelfare Secretary Robert H. Finch, andasection-by-sectionanalysIsofthe FamilyAssistanceActof 1969be printed at this point In the RECORD.The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tern-pore. The bill will be received and appro-priately referred; and, without objection,the explanatory statement and section-by-section analysis will be printed In theRECORD.The bill (S. 2986), to authorize a familyassistance plan providing basic benefitsto low-Income families with children toprovide incentives for employment andtraining to improve the capacity for em-ployment of members of such families, toachieve greater uniformity of treatmentof recipients under the Federal-Statepublic assistance programs and to other-wise improve such programs, and forother purposes, introduced by Mr. Sco(for himself and other Senators), wasreceived, read twice by its title, and re-ferred to the Committee on Finance.The material furnished by Mr. SCOTTfollows:CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014SENATESTATEMENT OF SECRETARY OF HEALTH, EDUCA-TION, AND WELFARE, ROBERT H. FINcH, INEXPLANATION OF THE FAMILY ASSISTANCEACT OF 1969The Family Assistance Plan is a revolu-tionary effort to reform a welfare system incrisis. With this program and the Adminis-tration's proposed Food Stamp plan, the Fed-eral Government launches a new strategy\u2014an income strategy\u2014to deal with our mostcritical domestic problems. For those amongthe poor who can become self-supporting,this strategy offers an avenue to greater in-come through expanded work incentives,training, and employment opportunities. Forthose who cannot work, there is a more ade-quate level of Federal support.1/ the Family Assistance and Food Stampproposals are enacted, we will have reducedthe poverty gap in this country by some 59percent. In other words, these two programstaken together will cut by almost 60 percentthe difference between the total income ofall poor Americans and the total amountthey would have to earn in order to rise outof poverty. In one particular category of thepoor, that of couples over 65 years of age, theFamily Assistance Plan will in fact raise re-cipients' incomes above the poverty line al-together. This income strategy includes anAdministration proposal for a 10 percent In-crease In Social Security benefits, coupledwith an automatic cost of living escalator.This is a real war on poverty and not just askirmish.I. THE FAILURE OF WELFAREOn August 8 the President addressed thenation and called the present well are systema failure. He said:\"Whether measured by the anguish of thepoor themselves, or by the drastically mount-ing burden on the taxpayer, the present wel-fare system has to be judged a colossalfailure.\"What began on a small scale in the de-pression 30's has become a huge monster Inthe prosperous 60's. And the tragedy Is notonly that it Is bringing States and cities tothe brink of financial disaster, but also thatIt is failing to meet the elementary human,social and financial needs of the poor.\"The failure of the system is most evidentIn the recent Increases In welfare costs andcaseloads. In this decade alone, totai costsfor the four federally-aided welfare pro-grams have more than doubled, to a levelnow of about $6 billion.In the Aid for Families with DependentChildren program (AFDC), costs have morethan tripled since 1960 (to about $4 billionat the present time) and the number ofrecipients has more than doubled (to some8.2 millIon persons). Even more disturbingIs the fact that the proportion of persons onAF'DC Is growing. In the 15 years since 1955,the proportion of children receiving assist-ance has doubled\u2014from 30 children per 1,000to about 60 per 1,000 at present.Prospects for the future show no likelihoodfor relief from the present upward spiral.By conservative estimates, AFDC costs willdouble again by Fiscal Year 1975, and case-loads will increase by 50 to 60 percent. Yet,the great irony is that despite these crushingcosts, benefits remain below adequate levelsin most States.Moreover, the present AFDC program isbuilt to fall. It embodies a set of inequitieswhich help to causeits own destruction,First, it is characterized by unjustifiable dis-crepancies as between regions of the country.With no national standards for benefit levelsand eligibilitypractices, AFDC paymentsnow vary from an average of $39 per monthfor a family of four in Mississippi to $263for such a family in New Jersey.Second, it is inequitable in its treatmentof male-headed families as opposed to thosebeaded by a female. In no State Is a male-headed family, where the mother is also InS 11723the home and the father is working fulltime for poverty wages, eligible for AFDC.In half the States, even families headed byunemployed males are still not eligible underthe AFDC\u2014UF program. On the other hand,families in poverty headed by women workingfull or part-time are almost universally cov-ered. The resultof this unfortunate dis..crimination is the creation of a powerfuleconomic incentive for the father to leavehome so that the State may better supporthis family than he can. For example, if afather employed full time in a low wage jobis able to earn only $2000 per year, and wel-fare in the State would pay a fatherless fam-ily $3000 per year, his wife and children arefinancially 50 percent better off if he leaveshome. And this financial incentive has takenits toll. In 1940, only 30 percent of the fami-lies on AFDC had absent fathers, but todaythe figure stands at over 70 percent.Third, AFDC imposes inequities betweenthose who work and those who do not. Be-cause families in poverty headed by workingmen are not covered, it is easily possible forsuch a working family to be less well offthan the welfare family. And what could bemore debilitating to the motivation to workto see the opportunity for one's family tobe better off on welfare? Moreover, the pres-ent system further undercuts the incentiveto work by reducing welfare payments toorapidly and by too much as the head of thehousehold begins to work.II. THE FAMILY AS5I5TANCE PLANThis Administration began its formal in-quiries into welfare reform even before theinauguration. From the report of the Transi-tion Task Force on Welfare to the presenttime, a number of reform proposals havebeen considered. The final result reflects thebest efforts of many different people in andout of government and in different Federalagencies.This analysis led us to the conclusion thatrevolutionary structural rejorm in the sys-tem is required. The first priority of theFamily Assistance Plan has been to remove,or at least minimize the inequities of pres-entwelfarepolicies.Itisdesignedto strengthen family life and incentives foremployment. This strategy may not pay offimmediately, but unless this investment ismade now, fundamental reform will be evenmore expensive in the future.The Family Assistance Plan provides fiscalrelief for hard pressed States and at the sametime raises benefit levels for recipients inthose areas where they are lowest. Of the$2.9 billion made available In new fundsunder, the plan for benefits to families andto aged, blind and disabled adults, an es-timated $700 million will have the effect ofproviding fiscalrelief for the States andabout $300 million will be for benefit in-creases for present recipients. But these goals,it must be said, cannot be our first priorityat the present time. There are others whowould Invest more of our available resourcesin benefit increases or in a federalization ofthe program designed to provide maximumfiscal relief to the States. These are not easyprioritiesto weigh and balance, but wehave concluded that\u2014while those other ap-proaches might be politically more popularin many respects\u2014they only pour more Fed-eral money into a system doomed to failure.The system must be changed, not just itspayment levels or the division of labor be-tween the Federal and State governmentswithin It.The technical operation of the Family As-sistance Plan is described in the attachedsummary. This memorandum will review Its major purposes.First, it combines powerful work require-ments and work incentives for employablerecipients. By Including the working poor\u2014families in poverty headed by men workingfull time\u2014the new plan much reduces and S 11724in many cases eliminates the inequity oftreatment between those who work and.thosewho do not. Second, by making it possiblefor a family to earn $60 per month withoutany reduction of benefits, a recipient willhave a strong financial Incentive to enteremployment and will be able to recoup hisexpenses of going to work without a drop intotal income. Third, the program includesa strong work requirement: those able bodiedpersons who refuse a training or suitable jobopportunity lose their benefits. For this rea-son, the program is not a guaranteed annualincome. It does not guarantee benefits topersons regardless of their attitudes; its sup-port Is reserved to those who are willing tosupport themselves. The work requirementis made effective by a new obligation of workregistration. In order to be eligible for bene-fits, applicants must first register with theiremployment service office so that training andjob opportunities can be efficiently commu-nicated to them. Mothers with children un-der six,are however, exempted from thisrequirement of work and work registrationand may elect to stay at home with theirchildren without any loss In benefits.Second, the Family Assistance Plan treatsmale and female-headed families equally. Allfamilies with children, whether headed bya male or female, will receive benefits if fam-ily income and resources are below the na-tional eligibility levels. From this structuralchange in coverage flows one of the key ad-vantages of the program in terms of familystability. No longer would an unemployedfather have to leave the home for his familyto qualify for benefits. In fact, the family Isbetter off with him at home since Its bene-fits are increased by his presence. And foremployed men, the system greatly reducesand in some cases reverses the financial in-centi'e to desert. In the example cited aboveof the father earning $2000 in a State wherehis family would receive $3000 on welfare, theFamily Assistance Plan would supplementhis wages by $960, giving the family $2960 inincome and eliminating the financial incen-tive for the father to leave home.Third, the program establishes a nationalminimum payment and national eligibilitystandards and methods of administration.For a dependent family of four, the Federalbenefit floor will be 81600 per year. Whenbenefits under the President's Food Stanil.proposal are also taken into account, theassistance package for such a family is about$2350 per year, or more than two-thirds ofthe poverty line as it ha,s been most recentlyredefined. This is not, of course, a sufficientamount to sustain an adequate level of lifefor those who have no other income; It is.nevertheless, a substantial Improvement andcan be made more adequate as budget condi-tions permit. As a result of the establish-ment of the Federal benefit floor of $1600,payment levels will be raised In 10 Statesandforabout20percentofpresent recipients.For the aged, blind, and disabled, a nation-wide income floor would be Set at $90 permonth per person of benefits plus other in-come. This comes on a yearly basis to $2160for two eprsons. an amount which Is actuallyabove th poverty line for an aged couple.This represents an Important change whichwe have made in the program since the Pres-ident announced It on August 8; when theminimum for the adult categories was setat $65.Perhaps at least as important as the es-tablishment of national minimum benefitlevels, however, is the provision of natIonaleligibility standards and administrative pro-cedures to govern the Family Assistance andState supplementary payment programs. Forthe first time, a single set of rules will applythroughout the nation, although the Stateswill remain free to administer their supple-mentary payment programs under these uni-form rules If they so desire. (The pre-exist-CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATEing State standards of need and paymentlevels will still continue to control in thesupplementary payment programs with re-gard to eligibility anad amount of benefits.)States will be given the option. for boththe supplementary payment and the adultcategory programs, to contract with the So-cial Security Administration for Federal as-sumption of some or all of the administra-tive burdens under these programs. In thisway, we should be able to move toward asingle administrative mechanism for trans-fer payments. taking advantage of all theeconomies of scale which such an automatedand national administered system can have.The eventual transfer of Food Stamp Pro-gram to the Department of Health, Educa-tion. and Welfare\u2014as previously proposed bythe Administration\u2014should further enhancethis administrative simplification.Fourth. the plan includes over $600 mil-lion for a major expansion of training andday care and opportunities. Some 150,000new training opportunities will be fundedunder thelegislation, which, when com-bined with the proposed Manpower TrainingAct isasimplified and centralized frame-work, should greatly broaden the opportu-nities for self support for recipients. Some450.000 quality child care positions are alsofunded in a new and flexible program whichfurther extends the Administration's com-mitment to the first five years of life.Fifth, the Family Assistance Plan providesmajor fiscal relief for the States. An esti-mated $700 million of the $2.9 billion In newFederal money being made available for ex-panded cash assistance will go to the Statesin the form of saving on their existing wel-fare costs. For five years from the date ofenactment, every State is assured fiscal re-lief at least equal to 10 percent of what itscosts would have been under the old wel-fare program. When these savings are com-bused with the new money going to theStates through the training and child carecomponents and through the separate reve-nue sharing program, major relief for Stategovernments is produced. In particular, byincluding the working poor within the Fam-ily Assistance Plan, we are establishing awholly Federal responsibility for a categoryof potential recipients which an Increasingnumber of States are beginning to assist attheir own Initiative. Some 7 States now haveStatewide programs of relief for the workingpoor and another 8 States have local or ex-perimental programs directed to these peo-ple\u2014all entirely at State expense. By estab-lishing a Federal program to cover the work-ing poor, we are relieving the States of whatseems to be the neat likely increase in costsand coverage.III. IMPACT ON OTHER PROGRAMSThe Family Assistance Plan has a majorImpact on several other Federal programshearing on the poor.First, we have changed the treatment ofunearned income compared to the presentwelfare system so that the recipient of FamilyAssistance benefits loses only 50 cents fromhis benefit for each dollar of unearned in-come received. This results In the eliminationof an important inequity which, for ex-ample. would make a female-headed familyof four ineligible for Family Assistance bene-fits if it received $1700 per year in alimonyor support payments, but would pay thatfamily a benefit if the husband were at homeand earning $1700 per year. It also has anImportant Impact on other Federal programssuch as Old Age. Survivors and DisabilityInsurance, and Unemployment Insurance byeliminating the dollar-for-dollar loss in bene-fits under welfare as income from these otherprograms Is received.Second, this legislation amends Title XIXMedicaid)to extend mandatory coverageunder that program to the APDC\u2014UF cate-gory. It Is not possible at this time to includeOctober 2,1969the working poor adults in Medicaid eventhough they are added to public assistancecoverage under Family Assistance.Third, Family Assistance has been carefullyharmonized with the Food Stamp Program.As has already been stated, the benefits underthese two programs are a.thUtlve, so that afamily of four receives a package of FamilyAssistance and Food Stamp subsidies total-ling about $2350. Moreover, the eligibilityceilings have been set at virtually the samepolnt\u2014$4000 for a family of four\u2014and bothprograms would now extend coverage to theworking poor.Finally, certain changes In the programsof services for AFDC recipients under TitleIV of the Social Security Act are necessitatedas a result of the Family Assistance Plan. TheDopartment of Health. Education, and Wel-fare will be submitting more comprehensiveamendments on the service program shortlyThese amendments will include an e,cpandedprogram of assistance to the States for fostercare.Inthe meantime, however, we areleaving the present AFDC services provisionsintact and retaining the 75-percent Federalmatching for the financing of these pco-grams.SUMMARYOFFAMILY ASSISTANCE Aci OF 1960TITLE I\u2014FAMILY ASSISTANCE PLANEstablishment of planSection 101 of the bill adds new parts D,E, and F to title IV of the Social SecurityAct, establishing a new Family AssistancePlan providing for payment of family assist-ance benefits by the Secretary of Health,Education, and Welfare and supplementarypayments by the States.Eligibility and amountThe new part D of title IV of the SocialSecurity Act authorizes benefits to familieswith children payable at the rate of $500 peryear for each of the first two members of afamily plus $300 for each additional member.The family assistance benefit would be re-duced by non-excluded income, so that fam-ilies with more non-excludable Income thanthese benefits ($1600 for a family of four)would not be eligible for any benefits.A family with more than $1500 in re-sources, other than the home, householdgoods. personal effects, and other propertyessential to the family's capacity for self-support, would also not be eligible.Countable income would Include bothearned income (remuneration for employ-merit and net earnings from self-employ-ment) and unearned income.Indeterminingincomethefollowing would be excluded (subject. in some cases,to limitations by the Secretary)(1) All income of a student;(2) InconsequentIal or Infrequent or Ir-regular income:(3) Income neededtooffsetnecessary child care costs while In training or work-ing:(4) Earned income of the family at therate of $720 per year plus '.. the remainder:(5) Food stamps and other public assist-ance or private charity:6Special training incentives and allow-ances:(7) The tuition portion of scholarshipsand fellowships:8Home produced and consumed . pro- duce:(9)', of other unearned income.Veterans pensions, farm price supports.and soil bank payments would not be ex-cludable income to any extent and would.therefore, result in reduction of benefits ona dollar for dollar basis.Eligibilityfor and amount ofbenefits would be determined quarterly on the basisof estimates of Income for the quarter, madein the light of the preceding period's incomeas modified in the light of changes in cii'-cumstances and conditions. October , 1969DefinitIon 0/ fanuly and ch4idTo qualify for Family Assistance Plan ben-efits a family must consist of two or morerelated Individuals living In their own homeand residing In the United States and ociemust be an unmarried child (I.e., under theage of 18, or under the age of 21 and regis-larly attending school).Payment of benefitsPayment may be made to any one or moremembers of the qualified family. The Secre-tary would prescribe regulations regardingthe filing of applications and supplying ofdata to determine eligibility of a family andthe amounts for which the family is eligible.Beneficiaries would be required to reportevents or changes of circumstances affectingeligibility or the amount of benefits.When reports by beneficiaries are delayedtoo long or are too Inaccurate, part or allof the resulting benefit payments could betreated as recoverable overpayments.Registration for work and referral fortrainingEligible adult family members would be re-quired to register with public employmentoffices for manpower services and training oremployment unless they belong to specifiedexcepted groups. However, a person in anexcepted group may register if he wishes.The exceptions are: (1)UI. incapacitated,or aged persons;(2) the caretaker relative(usually the mother) of a child under 6; (3)the mother or other female caretaker of thechild if an adult male (usually the father)who would have to register Is there; (4) thecaretaker for an Ill household member; and(5) full-tIme workers.Where the individual Is disabled, referralfor rehabilitation services would be made.Provision Is also made for child care servicesto the extent the Secretary finds necessaryIn case of participation in manpower services,training, or employment.Denial of benefitsFamily Assistance benefits would be deniedwith respect to any member of a familywho refuses without good cause to register orto participate In suitable manpower services,training, or employment. If the member Isthe only adult, he would be Included as afamily member but only for purposes ofdetermining eligibility of the family. Also,in appropriate cases, the remaining portionof the Family Assistance benefit would bepaid to an Interested person outside thefamily.On-the-job trainingThe Secretary would transfer to the De-partment of Labor funds which would other-wise be paid to families participating in em-ployer-compensated on-the-Job training if they were not participating. These fundswould be available to pay the training costsInvolved.STArE SUPPLEMENTATION OF FAMILY ASSISTANCEBENEFITSRequired supplementationThe Individual States would have to agreeto supplement the family assistance benefitsunder a new part E of title IV of the SocIalSecurity Act wherever the family assistancebenefit level Is below the previously existingAId to Families with Dependent Children(AFDC) payment level. ThIs supplementa-tion Is a condition which the State mustmeet in order to continue to receive Federalpayments with respect to maternal and childhealth and crippled children's services (titleV) and with respect to their State plans foraid to the aged, blind, and disabled (titleXVI), medical assistance (title XIX). andservices to needy families with children (partA oftitleXV). Such \"supplementation\"would be required to families eligible forfamily assistance benefits other than fam-ilies where both parents are present, neitherIs incapacitated, or the father Is not unem-CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014SENATEployed. The States would thus be requiredto ailpplement In the case of ndtviduals eligible under the old AFDO and .APDC\u2014UFpi'ovlslons they would not have to supple-ment in case of the working poor.Amount 0/ supplementationExcept as Indicated below and, except foruse of the State standard of need and pay-ment maximums, eligibility for and amountof supplementary payments would be deter-mined by use of the rules applicable forFamily Assistance benefits.In applying the family assistance rules tothe disregarding of Income under the sup-plementary payment program\u2014(1) In the case of earned Income of thefamily, the State would first disregard In-come at the rate of $720 per year, and wouldthen be permitted to reduce 'Its supplemen-tary payment by 16 2/3 cents for every dollarof earnings over the range of earnings be-tween $720 per year and the cutoff point forfamily assistance (I.e., $3,920 for a family offour), and could further reduce its supple-mentary payments by an amount equal tonot more than 80 cents for every dollar ofearnings beyond that family assistance cut-off point.(2) In the case of unearned income, thesesame percentage reductions would apply, al-though the Initial $720 exclusion would notapply.Requirements for agreementsSome of the State plan requirements nowapplicable In the case of Aid and Servicesto Needy Families with Children would bemade applicable to the agreement. These in-dude the requirements reatlng to:(I) Statewldeness;(2) AdmInistration by a single State agen-cy;(3) Fair hearing to dissatisfied claimants;(4) Methods of administration needed forproper and efficient operation, including per-sonnel standards, training, and effective useof subprofessional staff;(5) Reporting to Secretary as required;(6) ConfidentialIty of Information relatingto applicants and recipients;(7) Opportunity to apply for and promptfurnishing of supplementary payments.Payments to StatesA State agreeing to make the supplemen-tary payments would be guaranteed that Itsexpenditures for the first 5 full fiscal yearsafter enactment would be no more than 90per cent of the amount they would havebeen if the Family Assistance Plan amend-ments not been enacted. This would be ac-complished by Federal payment to each State,for each year, of the excess of\u2014(1) The total of Its supplementary pay-ments for the year plus the State share oflt expenditures called for under its existingState plan approved under title XVI plus theadditional expenditures required by the newtitle XVI, over(2) 90% of the State share of what Its ex-penditures would have been ill the form ofmaintenance payments for such year I! theState's approved plans under title I, IV(A)X, XIV, and XVI had continued in effect(assuming In the case of the part A of titleIV plan, payments for dependent children ofunemployed fathers).On the other hand, any State spending lessthan 50 per cent of the State share, referredto In clause (2) above, for supplementarypayments and Its title XVI plan would berequired to pay the amount of the deficiencyto the Federal treasury.A State would also receive '/2 of Its coat of administration under its agreement.ADMINISTRATIONAgreements with. StatesSufficient latitude Is provided to deal withthe Individual administrative characteristicsof the States. Provision Is made under whichthe Secretary can agree to administer andS 11725disburse the supplementary payments onbehalf of the States. Similarly the States canagree to administer portions of the familyassistance plan on behalf of the Secretary,with respect to all or specified families Inthe States.Evaluation, research, trainingThe Secretary would make an annual re-port to Congress on the new Family Assist-ance Plan, Including an evaluation of Itsoperation. He would also have authority tomake periodic evaluations of its operationand to use part of the program funds forthis purpose.Research into and demonstrations of bet-ter ways of carrying out the purposes of thenew Plan, as well as technical assistance tothe States and training of their personnelWho are Involved in making supplementarypayments, would also be authorized.Special provisions for Puerto Rico, the VirginIslands, and GuamThere are special provisions for these areasunder which the amount of family assist-ance benefits, the $720 of earned Income tobe disregarded, and several other amountsunder the Family Assistance Plan and thenew title XVI of the Social Security Act (aidto the aged, blind, and disabled) would bereduced to the extent that the per capitaIncome of these areas is below that of thatone of the 50 States which had the lowest percapita income.TRAINING, EMPLOYMENT, AND DAT CAREPROGRAMSSection102 of the Administration billwould replace part C of title IV of the SocialSecurity Act In Its entirety.PurposeThe purpose of the revised part C Is toprovide manpower services,training, and employment, and child care and related serv-ices for Individuals eligible for the new Fam-Ily Assistance Plan benefits (new part D) orState supplementary payments (new part E)to help them secure or retain employmentor advancement in employment. The intentIs to do this In a manner which will re-Sstore families with dependent children toself-supporting,independent,anduseful roles In the community.OperationThe Secretary of Labor is required to de-velop an employability plan for each Indi-vidual required to register under the newpart D or receiving supplementary paymentspursuant to the new part E. The plan woulddescribe the manpower services, traInhg, ndemployment to be provided and needed to.enable the Indlvldua.l to become self-sup-porting or attain advancement In employ-ment.AllowancesThe Secretary of Labor would pay an In-centive training allowance of $30 per monthto each member of a family participating Inmanpower training. Where training allow-ances for a family under another programwould be larger than their benefits under theFamily Assistance Plan and supplementaryState payments, the incentive allowances forthe family would be equal to the difference,or $30 per member, whichever Is larger.Allowances for transportation and otherexpenses would also be authorized.Theseincentive and otherallowances would be In lieu of allowances under othermanpower training programs.Allowances would not be payable to Indi-viduals participating in employer compen-sated on-the-job training.Denial of allowancesAllowances would not be payable to anindividual who refuses to accept manpowertaming without good cause. The Individualwould receive reasonable notice and have anopportunity for a hearing 11 dissatisfied withthe denial. S 11726tltilisation of other programsIn order to avoid the creation of duplica-ti ee programs, maximum use of authoritiesunder other acts could be made by the Secre-tary of Labor in providing the manpowertraining and related services under the re-vised part C, but subject to all duties andresponsibilities under such other programs.Part C appropriations could be used to paythe cost of services provided by other pro-grams and to reimburse other public agen-cies for services they provided to personsunder part C, The emphasis is on an inte-grated and comprehensive manpower train-ing program Involving all sectors of the econ-omy and all levels of government to makemaximum use of existing manpower andmanpower related programs.Appropriations and administrationAppropriations to the Secretary of Laborwould be authorized for carrying out therevised part C, including payment of up to90 percent of the cost of training and em-ployment services provided individuals reg-istered under the Family Assistance Plan.The Secretary would seek to achieve equita-ble geographical distribution of these funds.In developing policies and programs formanpower services, training and employmentfor Individuals registered under the FamilyAssistance Plan, the Secretary of Labor wouldhave to first obtain the concurrence of theSecretary of Health, Education, and Welfarewith regard to all programs under the usualand traditional authority of the Departmentof Health, Education, and Welfare.Child care and support servicesAppropriations to the Secretary of Health,Education, and Welfare would be authorizedfor grants and contracts for up to 90 per centof the cost of projects for child care andrelated services for persons registered underthe Family Assistance Plan and in manpowertraining or employment. The grants would goto any public or non-profit private agency ororganization, and the contracts could be withany public or private agency or organization.The cost of these services could include al-teration. remodeling, and renovation of fa-cilities, but no provision is made for whollynew construction, The Secretary of Health,Education, and Welfare could allow the non-federal share of the cost to be provided inthe form of services or facilities.These provisions (unlike other provisionsof the bill) would become effective on enact-ment of the bill.Advance funding'rnaffordadequate notice of availablefunds, appropriations for one year to pay thecost of the program during the next yearwould be authorized.Evaluation and researchA continuing eva.iation of the programunder part C and research for improving itare authorized.Annual report and advisory councilThe Secretary of Labor is required to re-port annually to Congress on the manpowertraining and related services.ELSMINATION OF pgzsEN'r PROVISIONS ON CASHASSISTANCE oa FAMILIES WITH DEPENDENTCHILDRENSection 103 of the bill revises part A oftitle IV of the Social Security Act whichrelates to cash assistance and services forneedy families with children. The new partA is called Services to Needy Families withChildren, reflecting the elimination of theprovisions on cash assistance.

All medicalassistance for which the Federal governmentshares costs will now be provided under ap-proved title XLX State plans,Requirements for State plansFew changes are made In this section (sec.1602), aside from deleting the provisions re-lating to medical assistance for the aged.The sectionretains,withoutsubstantial change, the requirements relating to:(1) AdministrationbyasingleState agency (except where a separate agency ispermitted for the blind as under existinglaw);(2i Financial participation by the State;(3) Statewldeness;(4) Opportunity for fair hearing:(5) Methods of administration, includingpersonnel standards, training, and effectiveuse of subprofessional staff;(8) Reporting to the Secretary as required;(7) Confidentiality of information relatingto recipients;(8) Opportunity for applioation and fur-nishing of assistance with reasonable prompt-ness;(9) Establishment and maintenance byOctober 2, 1969the State of standards for institutiOns flwhich there are individuals receiving aid;(10) Description of services provided forself-support or self-care; and(11) Determination of blindness by anophtalmologist or an optometrist.The present prohibition against paymentto persons in receipt of assistance under titleI, IV, X, or XIV would he applicable instea\u00e7ito cases of receipt of family security bene-fits under the new part D of title IV.The provision on inclusion of reasonablestandardsfordeterminingeligibilityand amount of aid would be replaced by onerequiringa minimum benefit of $90 permonth, less any other income, and by an-other requiring that the standard of need notbe lower than the standard applied under theState plan approved under the existing titleXVI or (in case the State had not had such aplan) the appropriate one of the standards ofneed applied under the plans approved undertitles I, X, and XIV.While the requirement relating to the de-termination of need and disregarding of cer-tain income in connection therewith hasbeen continued (although without the au-thorization to disregard $7.50 per month ofany income, in addition to other Incomewhich may or must be disregarded), it hasbeen expanded in a manner parallel to fam-ily assistance benefits to include disregard-ing as resources the home, household goods,personal effects, other property which mighthelp to increase the family's ability for self-support, and, finally, any other personal orreal property the total value of which doesnot exceed $1500. There would also be a newrequirement for not considering the finan-cial responsibility of any other individualfor the applicant or recipient unless the ap-plicant is the individual's spouse or child un-der the age of 21 or blind or severely dis-abled, and a prohibition against impositionof liens on account of benefits correctly paidto recipients.Other new requirements relate to provisionfor the training and effective use of socialservice personnel, provision of technical as-sistance to State agencies and local subdi-visions furnishing assistance or services, andprovision for the development, through re-search or demonstrations, of new or improvedmethods of furnishing assistance or services.Also added is a requirement for use of asimplified statement for establising eligibil-ity and for adequate and effective methodsof verification thereof. Finally, there are newrequirements for periodic evaluation of theState plan at least annually, with reportsthereof being submitted to the Secretary to-geher with any necessary modifications ofthe State plan; for establishment of advisorycommittees, including recipients as members;and for observing priorities and performancestandards set by the Secretary in the admin-istration of the State plan and in provid-ing services thereunder.The present prohibitions against any agerequirement of more than 65 years andagainst any citizenship requirement exclud-ing U.S. citizens would be continued.In place of the present provisions on resi-dency, there is a new one which prohibitsany residency requirement excluding any res-ident of the State. Also there would be newprohibitions against any disability or age re-quirement which excludes a severely disabledindividual aged 18 or older, and any blind-ness or age requirement which excludes anyperson who is blind (determined under cri-teria by the Secretary)PaylnentsIn place of the present provision on theFederal share of expenditures under the ap-proved State plan there is a new formulawhich provides for payment as follows withrespect to expenditures under State plans foraid to the aged, blind, and disabled approvedunder the new title XVI: October 2, 1969With respect to cash assistance, the Fed-eral Government wlU pay (1) 100 per cent ofthe first $50 per recipient, plus (2) 50 percent of the next $15 per recipient, plus (3)25 per cent of the balance of the paymentper recipient which does not exceed the maxi-mum permissible level of assistance per per-son set by the Secretary (which may be lowerin the case of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands,and Guam than for other jurisdictions).With respect to services for which expen-ditures are mnde under the approved Stateplan, the Federal Government would pay thesame percentages -as are provided under ex-isting law, that Is, 75 per cent in the caseof certain specified services and training ofpersonnel and 50 per cent in the case of theremainder of the cost of administration ofthe State plan.Payment by Federal Government toindividualsThe revised title XVI includes authorityfor the Secretary to enter Into agreementswith any State under which the Secretary willmake the payments of aid to the aged, blind,and disabled directly to individuals in theState who are eligible therefor. In that case,the State would reimburse the Federal Gov-ernment for the State's share of those pay-ments and for \u00bd the additional cost to theSecretary of carrying out the agreement,other than the cost of making the paymentsthemselves.Dc/i nit ionThe new title XVI defines aid to the aged,blind, and disabled as money payments toneedy Individuals who are 65 or older or areblind or are severely disabled.Transitional and related provisionsTitles I, X, and XIV of the Social SecurityAct would be repealed.Provision is made for making adjustmentsunder the new title XVI on account of over-payments and underpayments under the ex-isting public assistance titlesProvision is also made for according Statesa grace period during which they can beeligible to participate in the new title XVIwithout changing their tests of disability orblindness. The grace period would end forany State with the June 30 following theclove of the first regular session of its Statelegislature beginning after enactment of thebill.Conforming amendmentsThe bill also contains a number of con-forming amendments in other provisions ofthe Social Security Act in order to take ac-count of the substantive changes made bythe bill. Thus, the changes in the medicaidprogram (title XIX of the Social SecurityAct) would require the States to cover in-dividuals eligible for supplementary Statepayments pursuant to the new part S oftitle IV or who would be eligible for cashassistance under an existing State plan foraid to families with dependent children if Itcontinued in effect and included dependentchildren of unemployed fathers.Effective dateThe amendments made by the bill wouldbecome effective on the first January 1 fol-lowing the fiscal year in which the bill is enacted. However, if a State Is prevented bystatute from making supplementary pay-ments provided for under the new part S oftitle IV of the Social Security Act, the amend-ments would not apply to Individuals in thatState until the first July 1 which follows theend of the State's first regular session of Itslegislature beginning after the enactment ofthe bill\u2014unless the State certified before thisdate that It is no longer prevented by Statestatute from making the payments. In thelatter case the amendments would becomeeffective at the beginning of the first calen-dar quarter following the certification.Also, In the case of a State which is pre-vented by statute from meeting the require-CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014SENATEments In the revised section 1602 of the So-cial Security Act, the amendments -made Inthat title would not apply until the first July1 followIng, the close of the State's first reg-ular session of Its legislature beginning afterthe enactment of the bill\u2014unless the Statesubmitted before this date a State plan meet-ing these requirements. In the latter case theamendments would become effective on thedate of submission of the plan.Another exception to this effective dateprovision is made in the case of the new au-thorization, In the revised part C of title IVof the Social Security Act, for provision ofchild care services for persons undergoingtraining or employment\u2014which would be ef-fective on enactment of the bill.Mr. JAVITS.

I have today Introduced H,R.14173\u2014the Family Assistance Act of1969\u2014which Incorporates the sdznlnls-tratthm's recommendations for compre-hensive reform of our welfare laws. Iwill Include at the end of my remarksan analysis of the bilLOur present welfare system is a fail-ure\u2014marked by Inequities and abuses,encouraging family breakups, and per-petuating dependence on welfare pay-ments. The President's proposal consti-tutes the first major attempt to overhaulour Federal-State welfare system duringthe 30-year history of the program. Theneed to find workable solutions to theproblems we face In this field must begiven a high priority.The growing costs of this welfare sys-tem to our society\u2014both human and fi-nanclal\u2014require that new Initiatives bedeveloped to insure that all citizens haveboth the opportunity and responsibilityto participate In our economy. The Pres-ident's proposal provides new Initiativesthat are Intended to break the cyclicalheritage of poverty and dependency thathas become an all too prevalent char-acteristic of our Federal-State-local wel-fare system.The new approach Incorporated In thisbill is deserving of the most careful con-sideration by the Ways and Means Com-mittee in ounnection with the hearingson welfare that will begin In the latterpart of October.The analysis of the bill follows:SuMMARY op FAMILY ASSISTANCE ACT 07 1969;TrrLR I\u2014PAMrLY ASSISTaNCE PLANSSTADLISHMZNT OP PLANSectIon101 cut the bill adds new parts D.E, and P to tle IV of the Social SecurityAct, establishing a new Family AssistancePlan providing for payment Of family as-aistance benefit. by the Secretary of Health.Education, and Welfare and supplementarypayments by the 8tatee.EU\u00d8bfUty and amountThe new part D of tle IV of the SocialSecurity Act authorizes benefit. to familieswith children payable at the rate of $500per year for each of the first two members ofCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEa family pies $300for each additionalmember.\u00a3'familyassistance be with more non-excludable Income thanthese benefits ($1600 for a family of four)would not be eligible for any benefits.A family with more than $1500 in re-sources, other than the home, householdgoods, perscxial efiect., and other propertynt1a.l to the family's capacity for self-,upport would also not be eligible.Countable income would include bothearned income (remuneration for employ-ment and net earnings from self-employ-ment) and unearned income.In determiningincomethefollowing 'would be excluded (subject, in some cases,to limitations by the Secretary):(1) All income of a student;(2) Inconsequential or infrequent or ir-ragular Income;(3) Income needed tooffsetnecessary child care costs while in training or work-ing;(4) Earned income of the family at therate of $720 per year plus % the remainder;(5) Food stamps and other public assist-ance or private charity;(6) Special training Incentives and allow-ances;(7) The tuition portion of scholarshipsand fellowships;(8) Rome produced and consumed pro-duce;(9) One half of other unearned income.Veterans pensions, farm price supports, andsoil bank payments would not be excludableIncome to any extent and would, therefore,result in reduction of benefits on a dollar fordollar basis.Eligibilityfor en amount ofbenefit. would be determined quarterly on the basisof estimates of income for the quarter, madein the Ugh,t of the preceding period's Incomeas modified In the light of changes in cir-cuxnstances and conditions.Definition of family and childTo qualify for Family Assistance Planbenefits a family must consist of two or morerelated Individuals living in their own homeand residing In the United States and onemust be an unmarried child (i.e. under theage of 18, or under the age of 21 and regularlyattending school).Payment of benefitsPayment may be made to any one or moremembers of the qualified family. The Secre-tary would prescribe regulations regardingthe filing of applications and supplying ofdata to determine eligibility of a family andthe amounts for which the family Is eligible.Beneficiaries would be required to reportevent, or changes of circumstances affectingeligibility or the amount of benefits.When report. by beneficiaries are delayedtoo long or are too Inaccurate, part or all ofthe resulting benefit payments could betreated as recoverable overpayment..Registration for work and referral for trainingEligible adult family members would be re-quired to register with public employment-officers for manpower services and trainingor employment unless they belong to speci-fied excepted groups. However, a person Inan excepted group may if he wishes.The exceptions are: (1)ill, incapacitated,or aged persons;(2) the caretaker relative(usually the mother) of a child under 6; (3)the mother or other female caretaker of thechild If an adult male (usually the father)who have to register Is there; (4) the care-taker for an Ill household member; and (5)lull-time workers.Where the Individual I. disabled, referralfor rehabilitation services would be made.Provision Is also made for child care servicesto the extent the Secretary finds necaryIn case of participation in manpower seaT-Ices, training, or employment.October 3, 1969Denial of benefitsFamily Assistance benefit. would be deniedwith respect to any member of a family whorefuses without good cause to register or toparticipate In suitable manpower services.training, or employment. If the member isthe only adult, he would be Included as afamily member but only for purposes of de-tersnirxing eligibility of the family. Also, inappropriate cases, the remaining portion ofthe Family Assistance benefit would be paidto an interested person outside the family.On-the-job trainingThe Secretary would transfer to the De-partment of Labor funds which would other-wise be paid to families participating inemployer-compensated on-the-job trainingif they were not participating. These fundswould be available to pay the training costsinvolved.STATE SUPPLEMENTATION OF FAMILYASSISTaNCE BENEFITSRequired supplementationThe individual States would have to agreeto supplement the family assistance benefitsunder a new part E of title IV of the SocialSecurity Act wherever the family assistancebenefit level Is below the previously existingAid 'to Families With Dependent Children(AFDC) payment level. This supplementa-tion Is a condition which the State mustmeet in order to continue to receive Federalpayments with respect to maternal and childhealth and crippled children's services (titleV) and with respect to their State plans foraid to the aged, blind, and disabled (title XVI), medical assistance(title XIX), andservices to needy families with children (partA oftitleIV). Such \"supplementation\"would be required to families eligible forfamily assistance benefits other than fam-ilies where parents are present, neither Isincapacitated, or the father is not unem-ployed. The States would thus be requiredto supplement in the case of Individuals eli-gible under the old AFDC and AFDC\u2014tTPprovisions; they would not have to supple-ment In case of the working poor.Amount of supplementationExcept as indicated below and, except foruse of the State standard of need and pay-ment maximums, eligibility for and amountof supplementary payments would be deter-mined by use of the rules applicable forFamily Assistance Benefits.In applying the family assistance rules tothe disregarding of Income under the sup-plementary payment program\u2014(1) In the case of earned income of thefamily, the State would first disregard Incomeat the rate of $720 per year, and would thenbe permitted to reduce its supplementarypayment by 16% cents for every dollar ofearnings over the range of earnings between$720 per year and the cutoff point for familyassistance (Le., $3920 for a family of four),and could further reduce its supplementarypayments by an amount equal to not morethan 80 cents for every dollar of earnings be-yond that family assistance cutoff point.(2) In the case of unearned Income, thesesame percentage reductions would apply, al-though the Initial $720 exclusion would notapply.Requirements for agreementsSome of the State plan requirements nowappUumble In the case of Aid and Services toNeedy Families with Children would be madeapplicable to the agreement. These includethe requirements relating to:(1) Statewldeness;(2) AdministratIonbyasingleState agency;(3) PaIr hearing to dissatisfied claimants;(4) Methods of administration needed forproper and ecient operation. including per-onnel standards, training, and effective useof subprofessional staff;(5) Reporting to Secretary as required; October 8, 1969() Confidentiality ofinformation relat-ing to applicants and recipients;,(7) OpportunIty to apply for and promptfurnishing of supplementary payments.Payments to StatesA State agreeing to make the supplemen-tary payments would be guaranteed that itsexpenditures for the first five full fiscal yearsafter enacthaent would be no more than 90per cent of the amount they would havebeen If the Family Assistance Plan amend-ments not been enacted. This would be ac-.companled by Federal payment to each State,for each year, of the excess of\u2014(1) The total of Its supplementary pay-ments for the year plus the State share ofits expenditures called for under its existingState plan approved under title XVI plusthe additional expenditures required by thenew title XVI, over(2) NInety percent of the State share ofwhat its expenditures would have been inthe form of maintenance payments f suchyear if the State's approved plans undertitles I, IV(A), X, XIV, and XVI had n-tinued In effect (assuming in the case ofthe part A of title IV plan, payments for de-pendent children of unemployed fathers).On the other hand, any State spendingless than 50 per cent of the State share, re-ferred to in clause (2)above, for supple-mentary payments and its title XVI planwould be required to pay the amount of thedeficiency to the Federal treasury.A State would also receive I/ of its coatof administration under its agreement.ADMINISTRATIONAgreements with StatesSufficient latitude is provided to deal withthe individual administrative characteristicsof the States. Provision is made under whichthe Secretary can agree to administer anddisburse the supplementary payments on behalf of the States. Similarly the States can agree to administer portions of the familyassistance plan on behalf of the Secretary,with respect to all or specified families Inthe States.Evaluation, research, trainingThe Secretary would make an annual re- port to Congress on the new Family Assist-ance Plan., including an evaluation of itsoperation. He would also have authority tomake periodic evaluations of its operationand to use part of the program funds for thispurpose.Research into and demonstrations of bet-ter ways of carrying out the purposes of tilenew Plan, as well as technical assIstance tothe States and training of their personnelwho are Involved in making Supplementarypayments, would also be authorized.Special provisions for Puerto Rico, theVirgin Islands, and GuamThere are special provisions for these areasunder which the amount of family assist-ance benefits, the $720 of earned income tobe disregarded, and several other amountsunder the Family Assistance Plan and thenew title XVI of the Social Security Act (aidto the aged, blind, and disabled) would bereduced to the extent that the per capitaincome of these areas is below that of thatone of the 50 States which had the lowestper capita income.TRAINING, EMPLOYMENT, AND DAY CAREPROGRAMSSection102 of the Administration bill Would replace part C of title IV of the SocialSecurity Act in its entirety.PurposeThe purpose of the revised part C is toprovide manpower services,training, and employment, and child care and related serv-ices for individuals eligible for the new Fam-ily Assistance Plan benefits (new part D) or State supplementary payments (new partE) to help them secure or retain employ-ment or advancement in employment. TheIntent Is to do this In a manner which willrestore families with dependent chfldren toself-supporting,Independent, anduseful roles in the community.OperationThe Secretary of Labor Is required to de-velop an employability plan for each Individ-ual required to register under the new partD or receiving supplementary payments pur-suant to -the new part E. The plan would de-scribe the manpower services, training, andemployment to be provided and needed toenable the individual to become self-sup-porting or attain advancement in employ-ment.AllowancesThe Secretary of Labor would pay an in-centive training allowance of $30 per monthto each member of a family participating Inmanpower training. Where training allow-ances for a family under another programwould be larger than their benefits underthe Family Assistance Plan and supplemen-tary State payments, the incentive allowancesfor the family would be equal to the differ-ence,or$30per member, wlichever is larger,Allowances for transportation and otherexpenses would also be authorl,zed.Theseincentiveand otherallowances would be in lieu of allowances under othermanpower training programs.Allowances would not be payable to indi-viduals praticipating in employer compen-sated on-the-job training.Denial of allowancesAllowances would not be payable to an in-dividual who refuses to accept manpowertraining without good cause. The individualwould receive reasonable notice and have anopportunity for a hearing if dissatisfied withthe denial.Utili,sation of other programsIn order to avoid the creation of duplica-tive programs, maximum use of authoritiesunder other acts would be made by the Sec-retary of Labor in providing the manpowertraining and related services under the re-vised part C, but subject to all duties andresponsibilities under such other programs.Part C appropriations could be used to paythe cost of services provided by other pro-grams and to reimburse other public agen-cies for services they provided to persons un-der part C. The emphasis is on an integratedand comprehensive manpower training pro-gram involving all sectors of the economy andall levels of government to make maximumuse of existing manpower and manpower re-lated programs.Appropriations and administrationAppropriations to the Secretary of Laborwould be authorized for carrying out the re-vised part C, including payment of up to 90percent of the cost of training and employ-ment services provided individuals registeredUnder the Family Assistance Plan. The Secre-tary would seek to achieve equitable geo-graphical distribution of these funds.In developing policies and programs formanpower services, training and employmentfor individuals registered under the FamilyAssistance Plan, the Secretary of Labor wouldhave to first obtain the concurrence of theSecretary of Health, Education, and Welfarewith regard to all programs under the usualand traditional authority of the Departmentof Health, Education, and Welfare.Child care and support servicesAppropriations to the Secretary of Health,Education, and Welfare would be authorizedfor grants and contracts for up to 90 per cent of the cost of projects for child care and re- lated services for persons registered under theFamily Assistance Plan and in manpowertraining or employment The grants would go to any public or non-profit private agency or organization, and the contracts could be withany public or private agency or organization.119031The cost of these services could Includealteration, remodeling, and renovation ofduties, bi no provision Is made for whdlynew construction, The Secretary of Health,Education, and Welfare could snow the non-federal share of the cost to be provided 11*the form of services or facilities.These provisions (unlike other provisionsof the bill) would become effective on enact-ment of the bill.Advance fundingTo afford adequate noticeof available funds, appropriations for one year to pay thecost of the program during the next yearwould be authorized,Evaluation andresearchAcontinuing evaluation of the programunder part C and research for Improving itare authorized,Annual report and advisory councilThe Secretary of Labor Is required to re- port annually to Congress on the manpowertraining and related services,ELIMINATION OF PRESENT PROVISIONS ON CASHASSIsTANCE FOR FAMILIES WITH DEPENDENTCHILDRENSection 103 of the bill revises part A oftitle IV of the Social Security Act whichrelates to cash assistance and services forneedy families with children.

The grace period would end forOctober 3, 1969any State with the June 30 following theclose of the first regular session of its Statelegislature beginning alter enactment of thebill.Conforming amendmentsThe bill also contains a number of con-forming amendments In other provjslons ofthe Social Security Act In order to take ac-count of the substantive changes made bythe bill. Thus, the changes in the medicaidprogram (title XIX of the Social SecurityAct) would require the States to cover in-dividuals eligible for supplementary Statepayments pursuant to the new part E oftitle IV or who would be eligible for cashassistance under an existing State plan foraid to families with dependent children If Itcontinued In effect and Included dependentchildren of unemployed fathers.Effective dateThe amendments made by the bill wouldbecome effective on the first January 1 fol-lowing the fiscal year in which the bill Isenacted. However, if a State Is prevented bystatute from making the supplementary pay-ments provided for under the new part E oftitle IV of the Social Security Act, theamendments would not apply to individualsin that State until the first July 1 whIchfollows the end of he State's first regularsession of its legislature beginning after theenactment of the bill\u2014unless the State cer-tified before this date that it is no longerprevented by State statute from making thepayments. In the latter case the amendmentswould become effective at the beginning ofthe first calendar quarter following the cer-tification.Also, In the case of a State which Is pre-vented by statute from meeting the require-ments in the revised section 1602 of the So-cial Security Act, the amendments made inthat title would not apply until the firstJuly 1 followIng the close of the State's firstregular session of Its legislature beginningafter the enactment of the bill\u2014unless theState submitted before this date a State planmeeting these requirements. In the lattercase the amendments would become effectiveon the date of submission of the plan.Another exception to this effective dateprovision Is made In the case of the new au-thorization, in the revised part C of title IVof the Social Security Act, for provision ofchild care services for persona undergoingtraining or employment\u2014which would beeffective on enactment of the bill. }HOUSEOF REPR.ESENTATIVES { FAMILYASSISTANCE ACT OF 1970 REPORTOF THECOMMITTEEON WAYS AND MEANS ONH.R. 16311TO AMEND THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT TO PROVIDEA BASIC LEVEL OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE THROUGH-OUT THE NATION TO NEEDY FAMILIES WITH CHIL-DREN, TO PROVIDE INCENTIVES FOR EMPLOYMENTAND TRAINING OF MEMBERS OF SUCH FAMILIES, TO IMPROVE THEADULTASSISTANCE PROGRAMS, TOMAKE OTHER CHANGES TO IMPROVE THE PUBLICASSISTANCE PROGRAMS, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES U.S. GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE37-0060 WASHINGTON :1970 CONTENTS PMge I.

R. 16311) to amend the Social Security Act to provide a basiclevel of financial assistance throughout 'the Nation to needy familieswith children, to provide incentives for employment and training ofmembers of such families, to improve the adult assistance programs,and to make other changes to improve the public assistance programs,having considered the same, report favorably thereon without amend-ment and recommend that the bill do pass.I. PRINCIPAL PURPOSES AND SCOPE OF THE BILLPresident Nixon, in transmitting his recommendations on welfarereform to the Congress in October of 1969, declared\u2014The present welfare system has failed us\u2014it has fostered familybreakup, has provided very little help in many States and has evendeepened dependency by all too often making it more attractiveto go on welfare than to go to work.1 propose a new approach that will make it more attractive togo to work than to go on welfare, and will establish a nationwideminimum payment to dependent families with children.The President listed the following effects of his proposal:For the first time, all dependent families with children inAmerica, regardless of where they live, would be assured ofminimum standard payments based upon uniform and singleeligibility standards.(1) 2For the first time, the more than 2 million families who makeup the \"working poor\" would be helped toward self-sufficiency andaway from future welfare dependency.For the first time, training and work opportunity with effectiveincentives would be given millions of famihes who would otherwisebe locked into a welfare system for generations.For the first time, the Federal Government would make a strongcontribution toward relieving the financial burden of welfarepayments from State governments.For the first time, every dependent family in America would beencouraged to stay together, free from economic pressure tosplit apart.The provisions of H.R. 16311, as reported by your committee arewith certain exceptions described in this report, essentially patternedafter the proposals of the rresident.The bill is mtended to convert the existing program from one whichresults in people remaining in dependency to one which will encouragepeople to become independent and self-supporting through incentivesto take training and enter employment.Your committee's bill would make major improvements and re-forms in the provisions of the Social Security Act relating to theprograms which aid needy families with children, including coverage of the working poor; the programs which aid the aged, blind, anddisabled; and the programs which provide manpower services, train-ing, employment, and child care to welfare recipients. PAMILY ASSISTANCEFirst, the bifi would make basic reforms in the program whichfurnishes assistance to needy families with children, rem9ve inequitiesin treatment of the working poor and the nonworking poor, emphasizework incentives and work requirements, and improve and simplifyadministration of such p!lblic assistance, by providing\u2014(1) A new basic Federal family assistance plan, with federallyassisted State supplementation, for poor families with childrenin place of the present program of aid to families with dependentchildren, but including for the first time coverage of poor familiesregardless of the work status of the father (the States woult notbe required to supplement payments to the working poor);(2) Requirements that, as a prerectuisite to receipt of benefits,every adult in the assisted families (including the adult alreadyworking) register at the employment office for work or training(except mothers with preschool children and persons who are illor of advanced age), or sign up for vocational rehabilitation ifhandicapped.(3) Uniform, nation-wide, eligibility requirements and pay-ment procedures, both for the basic Federal family assistance planand the State supplementary payments;(4)Incentivesfor the States to make agreements with theFederal Government to administer supplementary paymentsprograms; and(5) New provisions holding deserting parents responsible forFederal payments made to their families under the familyassistance or State supplementary plans. 3WORK AND TRAININGSecond, the bill improves the program of employment and trainingservices and of other services (including child care) needed by re- cipients who are registered at employment offices by' providing\u2014(1) A new program of manpower, training, and employmentservices to be administered by the Secretary of Labor throughthe State employment offices;(2) A Federal program of full-cost grants and contracts forchild care services to enable mothers who are required to registerfor training and employment (as well as those who register on a voluntary basis) to participate in work or training;(3) A new system of providing services to support training oremployment through agreements between the Federal Govern-ment and the States; and(4) A more equitable, uniform, and effective system of incentiveallowances and reimbursement of work expenses.ADULT ASSISTANCEThird, the bill would substantially improve the effectiveness ofthe adult assistance programs under the Social Security Act byproviding\u2014(1) For combining the present categories for assistance to theaged, blind and disabled into one combined adult assistanceprogram and for uniform requirements for such eligibility factorsas the level and type of resources allowed and degree of disabilityor blindness;(2) That the States assure that each aged, blind, or disabled,adult will receive assistance sufficient to bring his total incomeup to $110 a month;(3) Incentives for the States to enter into agreements for Fed-eral administration of the combined program; and(4) A simplified Federal matching formula which will result ingenerally more favorable Federal participation in the cost of thepayments.II. SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL PROVISIONSFAMILY ASSISTANCE PLANELIGIBILITY FOR AND AMOUNT OF PAYMENTSEach family with children whose nonexcludable income (for defini-tion of excluded income see below) is less than the family benefitlevel\u2014computed as $500 each for the first two members of the familyand $300 for each additional member\u2014would be eligible for a paymentunder the family assistance plan after meeting the registration forwork or training and other requirements. The amount of the benefitwould be the difference'between these amounts and the non-excludedincome. For example, a family of four with no income would be eligiblefor.a family assistance payment of $1,600. Every needy family, boththose now eligible under aid for families with dependent children(including those in families with unemployed fathers who are notH.Rept. 91\u2014904 O\u20142 4covered because they are in a State which has not exercised the optionto cover this group) and those not eligible because the father is working(the working poor) would be eligible.In determining income for the purpose of establishing eligibility forand the amount of the family assistance payment, the following typesand amounts of income *ould be excluded:(1) All earnings of a child if regularly attending school;(2) Infrequently or irregularly received amounts of earned orunearned income, but not more than $30 a quarter foreach type;(3) Earnings needed to pay for necessary child care;(4) All earned income of adult members of the family at therate of $720 per year plus one-half of the remainder;(5) Food stamps and other public or private charity (notmcluding veterans' pensions);(6) The training allowance for those in training;(7) The tuition part of scholarships and fellowships; and(8) Homegrown and used produce.A family with more than $1,500 in resources, other than the home,household goods, personal effects and property essential to the family'smeans of self-support would not be eligible for family assistancepayments.Eligibility would be computed on a quarterly basis; payments wouldgenerally be made on a monthly basis.Parents who desert or abandon their families would be liable to theFederal Government for any Federal payments to their families underthe family assistance plan and the Federal portion of the State supple-mentary payments (described later) or for the amount of a courtsupport order if less. Such sums are to be collected directly or bywithholding them from payments due the parents under any Federalprogram.DEFINITIONS OF FAMILY AND CHILDAn eligible family must consist of two or more persons (related byblood, marriage, or adoption), living together in the United States, atleast one of whom is a child who is not married to another familymember and who is in the care of or dependent upon another memberof the family. Appropriate State law would be applied in determiningrelationships. A parent or spouse of a parent who is temporarily absentfrom the place of residence, seeking or engaging in employment(including military service), would be considered as living in the placeof residence. A \"child\" is an individual who is under age 18, or a full-time student under age 21.REGISTRATION WITH PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT SERVICEEach member of a family would be required to register for employ-inent or training with a public employment office unless he or she is\u2014(1) unable to engage in work or training because of illness,disability, or age;(2)amother caring for a child under 6;(3) the mother in cases in which the father registers;(4) caring for an ill member of the household; or(5) a child under 16 or under 21 if in school.Any person who falls into one of these exempt categories couldvoluntarily register at the employment office. 5Thosewho are unable to participate in work or training because of disabthtj would be referred for vocational rehabilitation services.The Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare is required to provide (for as long as he deems appropriate) child care services where an mdividual is. registered and participating in training and employ-ment.If an individual required to register refuses to do so without good cause, or refuses vocational rehabilitation services without goodcause, he would not be taken into account (but his income would becounted) in determining the family benefit. In such a case, the family benefit may be paid to a person outside the family under a pro- tective payment arrangement.STATE SUPPLEMENTATION OF FAMILY ASSISTANCE PAYMENTREQUIREMENTS FOR STATE BUPPLEMENTATIONEach State whose AFDC payment level in January 1970 is higherthan the family assistance level must agree to supplement the familyassistance payment (under the conditions specified in the bill) up to that level (except where otherwise provided by the bill) or up to the poverty level if that is lower, in order to be eligible for Federal fundsunder Medicaid and other welfare programs. Federal matching wouldbe available, except for the working poor, at a rate of 30 percent. The matching maximum would be the poverty level now in effect, butbrought up to date aimually by the Secretary of Health, Education,and Welfare to reflect increased living costs.The States would.not have to supplement payments to the workingpoor. However, in addition to being required to supplement caseswhich would be eligible under their present programs as in effect in January 1970 the States would have to supplement those cases which would be eligible if the program had the same resources limita- tions as the family assistance plan ($1,500 except for home, house-hold goods, and personal effects), the same definition of family andchild, and the same excludable income provisions (other than thosewhich disregard proportions of earned income). The States alsowould be required to supplement the incomes of families where thefather is unemployed (which is now on an optional basis), or where thechild is between age 18 and 21 and regularly attending school (nowalso on an optional basis).AMOUNT OF SUPPLEMENTARY PAYMENTSThe States would be required to follow the rules that apply underthe family assistance plan m computing payments except that specialrules would apply in disregarding earned income for purposes of thesupplementary payments.The States would have to exclude the first $720 a year ($60 a month)of earned income, plus (1) one-third of the earnings between $720and twice the amount of the family assistance payment which would bepayable if the family had no income, pius (2) one-fifth of any earmngsabove that amount. The effect of the combined earnings exemptionsunder the State supplementation and under the family assistanceplan is roughly the equivalent of present law which provides for 6excluding work expenses and disregarding the first $30 of monthlyearnings plus one-third of earnings over that amount. For example, ifthe adults in a family of four had $1,200 in annual earned income thebasic $1,600 family assistance payment would be reduced by one-halfof the $480 remaining after $720 is deducted from $1,200. Thus, thefamily assistance payment would be reduced to $1,360 ($1,600\u2014$240). If the family lived in a State where the State payment (to afamily of four with no income) in January 1970 was $2,400, the re-quired States supplement payment would be figured as follows:The family assistance payment\u2014$1,360\u2014plus the earned income notdisregarded\u2014two-thirds of the $480, or $320\u2014is subtracted from the$2,400 figure. This results in a supplementary payment of $720. Thetotal income of such a family would consist of $1,320 in' family as-sistance payment, $720 in the State supplementary payment and$1,200 m earnings, for a total annual income of $3,280.ADMINISTRATIONADMINISTRATIVE ARRANGEMENTSThe bill,provides for three alternative administrative arrangements.First, the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare could make anarrangement with a State for the Federal Government to administerboth the family assistance plan and the State supplementary program.Under this arrangement the Federal Government would pay all ad-ministrative costs. Second, the Secretary could make an agreementwith a State under which the State would administer the family assis-tance payments and State supplementary payments. Third, if theSecretary makes no agreement with a State the State will administerthe supplementary payments and the Federal Government will ad-minister the family assistance payments. Under the second and thirdarrangements, the Federal Government would _pay all the cost ofadministering the family assistance plan and the Federal Governmentand the States would share equally in the administrative costs of mak-ing the State supplementary payments.APPEALS PROCEDUREPersons who disagree with determinations relating to eligibility foror amounts of familyassistance plan payments may obtain a hearin.For persons on the rolls payments would continue until there is a deci-sion based on the hearing, which must be rendered within 90 days of arequest for hearing. If the decision based on the hearing is adverse, themoney paid out in theinterim by the Federal Government wouldhave to be returned. Final determinations are to be subject to judicialreview in Federal district courts but the Secretary's decisions as to anyfact would be conclusive and not subject to review by the court.SPECIAL PROVISIONS FOR PUERTO RICO, GUAM, AND THEVIRGIN ISLANDSThe family assistance plan applies to Puerto Rico, Guam, and theVirgin Islands, but all of the dollar figures in both the family assistanceplan and the revised program of aid to the aged, blind, and disabled(except for the $720 of earnings disregarded under the family assistance 7plan) program are to be modified (but only. downward) by the same proportion that the per capita income of each bears to the per capita income of the lowest per capita-income State.WORK ANDTIuiNINGPROGRAMSXIBTING PROGRAM REPEALEDThe existing work incentive program (whiehwent into effect in allthe States on July 1, 1969) would be repealed and a new program would be established to take its place.OPERATION OF PROGRAMThe Secretary of Labor would, under his own priorities for the selection of participants, assure the development of an employabilityplan for each individual registered with the employment office underthe program. The training and employment potentials of the workingpoor who are registered will be closely examined toward the end oflessening, or completely eliminating, their dependency on cash bene- fits under the program. Mothers with children who vol- unteer would be given the same consideration for participation asthose who are referred on a mandatory basis.The individuals would then receive the services and training calledfor under the plan (including grants to relocate a family to find em- ployment). The training and services would be similar to those cur- rently provided under the WIN program, including special workprojects for the performance of work m the public interest throughcontracts with governmental agencies and nonprofit organizations.The Secretary of Labor would be required to use other manpowerprograms to the maximum extent feasible. The State welfare depart-ments would be required to provide health and other supportiveservices to facilitate the participation of individuals in the trainingprogram.Appropriations are authorized to meet up to 90 percent of the costof the training program. The non-Federal contribution could be madein cash or in kind. If the required non-Federal matching of 10 percentwas not met in any State, a portion of its Federal share of medicaidand other welfare program expenditures would be withheld until thedeficit was made up. Authorization is also made for advance funding.The Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare may transfer to theSecretary of Labor the amount of money that family assistancerecipients would have received if they were not beingpaid wages undera Labor Department on-the-job training program. These funds are tobe available to support such programs.TRAINING ALLOWANCESEach person participating in the training program would receivean allowance of $30 a month. Larger incentive payments mai beavailable for participants in institutional programs where MDTAallowances are payable. The Secretary of Labor would also provideallowances to cover the transportation and other costs directly asso-ciated with the training. 8REFITSAL TO ACCEPT TRAINING OR EMPLOYMENTAn individual who, without good cause, refuses to accept suitabletraining or employment would receive the same treatment as a personwho refuses to register.CHILD CAREThe Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare both directly(by contract or grant to public or private agencies) and through asystem of prime grantees is required to provide necessary child careservices for individuals participating in training or employment underthe manpower program. The Secretary is authorized to make grants forup to 100 percent of the costs of child care projects to public or non-profit private agencies which, in a particular geographic area, willassure that day care is provided to manpower training participants.Such prime grantees would be designated by the appropriate electedor appointed official or officials in such area and would have to dem-onstrate a capacity to work effectively with the manpower agency.Where appropriate, group or institutional care for children attendingschool would be provided through arrangements with a local educa-tional agency. Child care would be provided in the light of the differ-ent circumstances and needs of the children involved, and where afamily is able to pay for care the Secretary could charge a fee reason-ably related to that ability. Appropriations (no dollar amount speci-fied) and advance funding are authorized,EVALUATION AND ANNUAL REPORTThe Secretaries of Labor and Health, Education, and Welfare wouldbe required to provide continual evaluation of the manpower andemployment program. The Secretary of Labor may contract forindependent evaluationand he may establish a data collection,processing, and retrieval system. The Secretary of Labor would filean annual report with the Congress on the operation of the trainingprogram, and the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare wouldreport similarly on the child care and supportive services providedunder the bifi. The first of such reports would be due on or beforeSeptember 1, 1972. An authorization of $15 million a year is providedfor research and evaluation activities relating to work and training.SOCIAL SERVICES FOR FAMILIES Wi DEPENDENT CHILDRENThe present program of aid to families with dependent childrenwould be changed by removing all cash assistance provisions. Theprovisions of present law under which the costs of social services, cer-tain foster care, and emergency assistance are subject to 50\u201475 percentFederal matching would be retained.AID TO THE AGED, BLIND, AND DISABLEDFEDERAL STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTSThe present provisions for programs for aid to the needy aged,blind, and disabled are repealed and a new combined Federal-Stateprogram is established to cover essentially the same people. 9Under the new program, the States could not have (1) any duration of residence requirement,(2) any citizenship requirement whichincludes any U.S. citizen,or (3) a requirement which would excludealiens lawfully admitted forpermanent residence who hav resided inthe United States continuously for 5 years immediately prior to application, or (4) relative responsibility provisions other than for spouses or parents of recipients.The States would be required to (1) provide a payment sufficient to bring an individual's total income up to at least $110 a month, or, if higher, the standard in effect on the date of enactment, (2) follow the Secretary's definitions of blindness and disability, (3) make applicable to the disabled the mandatory disregard of the first $85 a month of earned income plus one-half of the remainder, now applicable to the blind, (4) make applicable to the aged oi an optional basis the same earnings exemption ($60 a month plus. one-half of additionalearnings) applicable to the family assistance plan, and (5) use the Federal definition of allowable resources applicable to the family assistance plan ($1,500 plus home, personal effects, and income- producing property essential to the person's support). The provision m the Social Security Amendments of 1969 requiring the States to pass along to adult assistance recipients $4 of the social securitybenefit increase, which as enacted applies only to the months of April, May, and June 1970, would be continued indefinitely.FEDERAL MATCHING PROVISIONSThe Federal Government would pay .90 percent of the first $65 of average payments made to eligible adult assistance recipients, and 25 percent of the remainder up to a limit to be set by the Secretary. The Federal Government would also pay 50 percent of the administrative costs of the adult programs. ADMINISTRATIONThe States could continue to administer the adult programs, or the Secretary could enter into an agreement with a State under which the Federal Government would perform all or some of the functions in- volved in making payments .under the program. In the latter case, the Federal Government wouldpay all administrative costs.EFFECTIVE DATEThe provisions of the bill (except for authorization for money to support child care projects which would -be effective upon enactment) would be effective on July 1, 1971, with special provisions for States with.stattes that would prevent them from complying with the bill at that time.III. GENERAL DISCUSSION OF THE BILLA. ESTABLISHMENT OF A PLAN FOR ASSISTANCE TOFAMILIES WITH CHILDRENYour committee is very concerned about the rapid growth in the number, as well as the increase in the proportion, of children receiving aid under AFDC programs. Since 1960, the number of recipients has 10increased from 2.4 million to about 6.7 million. Moreover, the propor-tion of children receiving assistance has been rapidly increasing\u2014from 30 children per 1,000 in 1955 to about 60 children per 1,000 in1970.In addition the costs of these programs have more than tripledduring the last 10 years (to about $4 billion at present) and, accordingto estimates by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare,could more than double again during the next 5 years unless action istaken now to deal with the underlying causes of this crushing in-creasein both costs and numbers of recipients.The major part of the increase has resulted from the added numberof families who receive aid because the father is absent from thehome. These cases, including those in which the father has abandonedhis family and cases in which the mother is not married to the father,now make up over three-fourths of the families on the AFDO rolls.Your committee made a number of modifications in the familassistance provisions of the bifi proposed by the administration whicare designed to halt the trends that have existed in the growth of thenumber of families on the AFDC rolls.During its deliberations, the principal efforts of your committeewere in the direction of strengthening the provisions of the legislationto assure the establishment of an effective work and training program,building upon the groundwork that has been laid in putting theexisting work incentive program into operation. It is the clear intentionof your committee, based upon assurances given by the Secretary ofHealth, Education, and Welfare and the Secretary of Labor, that thework and training program will provide a method of guaranteeingthat all adult members of families receiving assistance under the familyassistance plan will receive all available training and employmentservices and other supportive services, including child care, necessaryto assist them in obtaining employment and ultimately attainingself-support.Your committee wishes to emphasize its clear understanding thatall adult family assistance recipients, except for those specificallyexempted by the bill, must register for training or employment. Con-trary to the administration's proposal, under the committee bill thisrequirement applies to the workingpoor as well as to those who areunemployed or working part time. The committee believes this is anessential difference and a material improvement in the bill. Under thismodification the employment status of many of the working poorparents will be improved and upgraded.Your committee also added to the bill provisions holding parentswho abandon their families responsible for Federal assistance receivedy their families. This new approach plus greater emphasis by theFederal Government and the States in implementing the determina-tion of patertht, the location of absent parents and the enforcementof support provisions of the 1967 Social Security Amendments shouldhave some effect in reducing the growth of the assistance rolls.Several times in the past your committee has attempted, within theframework of the existing AFDC progtams, to provide measuresthrough which families could be assisted in maintaining stability andachieving economic independence. In the course of the last decade,major legislation providing for a wide range of services to AFDCfamilies and for strong emphasis on work and training for assistancerecipients has been enacted. The legislation enacted in 1962 and 1967 11attempted to reverse the increasing dependence of families on assist- ance. It has become obvious, however, that basic structural andadministrative changes in the AFDC programs are necessary if the present trends of family instability and dependence on welfare are to be halted and reversed.The mjor thrust of the bill is toward:1. Equitable treatment of working poor families;2. The reduction of variations in payment levels among the States through the introduction of a Federal floor for family assistance payments;3. Assisting familiesinachieving economic independencethrough a national uniform requirement to ;egister for employ-ment and training and the establishment of a strengthened manpower training program.The overall plan representsa new direction for family assistance andwas designed to carry out the intent of your committee to reducedependence on assistance and restore more families to employment and self-reliance, and thereby eventually reverse the present trend of spiraling cost and increasing dependence upon welfare.1. THE FAMILY ASSISTANCE PLANa. Eligibility for andamountof family a9sitance paymeiits(1) Eligibiity.\u2014Each family with children under 18 (or under 21if attending school) whose income (other than that excluded) is lessthan $500 per year for each of the first two family members and$300 per year for each additional family member, and whose resqurces (other than those excluded\u2014the home, the household goods, personaleffects, etc.) are less than $1,500 would be eligible to receive a family assistance benefit.Your committee believes that one inequity in the present AFDCprogram that should be remedied at this time is the exclusion ofneedy families where the father is in the home and fully emJ1oyed.Your committee believes it is bad social policy to have families inlike situations treated differently because of the employment status of the family head. The exclusion of 'families in which the father isworking has acted as an incentive to fathers to become unemployedor leave home in order to qualify their families for assistance. Thebill would, therefore, include working poor families under the pro- gram and provide a uniform earnings exemption which is equallyapplicable to families with male and female heads as well as those who are fully and partially employed. For purposes of Federal benefits under the family assistance plan, the first $60 a month in earnizgs would be disregHrded plus one-half of the remainder, so that it would be possible, for example, to have a family of four receiving some benefits under the program up until its income exceeds $3,920.Your committee's bill would eliminate two other situations of lackof equal treatment. At present, AFDC benefits are available to families with unemployed fathers in some States, but not in others. Second,unemployment has been defined by the Department of Health,Education, and Welfare as working for less than 30 hours a week, which may be an incentive for many families to restrict their work B. Rept.91\u2014904 0\u2014S 12activities. These two distinctions would be eliminated as to Federalbenefits under the new program.The committee agrees with the administration that it is essentialthat we do not perpetuate the situation where working people see littleor no economic advantage in continuing in employment and drop outof the work force to become totally dependent on the welfare system.(2) Amoun.\u2014The family assistance benefit would consist of $500 peryear for each of the first two family members, plus $300 per year for eachadditional family member, and would be reduced by nonexcludedincome. In any family there are certain common expenses in housing,utthties, fuel, etc., which must be met. Since the smallest family thatwill be covered is one consisting of two persons, your committeebelieves that it is logical that the amount provided for each of thefirst two members of the family be 1\u00e4rer than the amounts providedfor each additional member of the family.These payment rates establish a Federal income maintenance floorwhich in most States will be increased by required State supplementa-tion for all families except the working poor. In the eight Stateswhose AFDC payments are now lower than the basic Federal floor,the bill provides an increase in the level of aid to needy families withchildren. The amount of payments maj be lower in the case of indi-viduals in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Guam than in theStates, but would be substantially higher than at present.(3) Period for determination of benefit&\u2014Your committee's billprovides that a family's eligibility for benefits, and the amount ofits benefits would be determined for each calendar quarter on thebasis of estimates of income for that quarter, made m the light ofincome received in previous quarters. The estimates could be modifiedin the light of changes in circumstances and conditions, and in accord-ance with regulations regarding applications filed late in a quarter,or in cases in which income and expenses in one period are to someextent attributed to another period. Provision is also made for render-ing a family ineligible for benefits if its gross income from a trade orbusiness is unduly large.The bill would provide for use of a calendar-quarter accountingperiod rather than a shorter period, such as a month, or a longer period,such as a year. One important advantage of the quarterly accountingperiod is that it would facilitate verification of earnings through use ofsocial security records, since social security earnings are reported on aquarterly basis. Records of monthly earnings are not available fromeither the Social Security Administration, or the Internal RevenueService.Your committee's bill would allow the Secretary of Health, Educa-tion, and Welfare to prescribe by regulation the circumstances underwhich and extent to which a family's payments will be reduced be-cause the application for payments was filed some time after thebeginning of a quarter. Many potential applicants would not knowthat they would lose payments by not filing when they were firsteligible, and in addition, there would be many reasons why an appli-cation could not be flied as soon, as the need arose\u2014e.g. the onlyadult member of the family could be ill, or unaware of possible help,with the result that he would fail to file as early in the calendarquarter as he should. 13Your committee has concluded that, in some cases, in order to prevent inequity it would not be appropriate to count as income for a quarter all income received in that quarter, a part of which should properly be distributed to prior or subsequent quarters. For example a self-employed farmer often receives the bulk of his income in the fall when his crops are sold, and little or no income during the rest of the year. If such a person's income were counted in the quarter in which it is received, he could getno payments for that quarter. Conversely,the amount of income received in a single quarter might be sufficient to disqualify a family forany payments during the year. Your committee'sbill provides, therefore, that, in determining eligibility and payment amounts, the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare may allocate income received in a given quarter to prior or subsequent quarters In the case of self-employment income, your committee expects that the Secretary would ordinarily allocate the annual income evenly to each of the four quarters of theyear, unless the nture and circumstances ofthe self-employment incomewere such as to make this allocation in-appropriate. Payment amounts would be determined as though in- come were earned in the quarter to which the income is assigned. (4) Special limits ongross income.\u2014Your committee believes thatthe net earnings from farming and certain other businesses require special treatment. People in such businesses may have substantial gross incomes during a year but net earnings small enough to qualify themselves and their families for payments under the family assistance plan. The net earnings ofa family whose income is derived from a busi- ness can fluctuate considerably from year to year. The net earnings may be high in one year and very low the next year. One reason for this is that a businessman has considerable control over the amount of hs net earnings; hemay choose the time to incur a number of busi-ness expenses in order to increase or decrease his net earnings in any given year.Also the amount of net earnings depends to a large extent on business expenses, which are deductible for income tax purposes. Depreciation allowances and other income tax deductions, for example, reduce the net earnings of a businessman without actually reducing his spendable income.In the opinion of your committee it would be inappropriate to permit people who have a largegross income to get family assistance pay-ments when they have a substantial cash flow from which they live in moderate or better-than-moderate circumstances. For this reason, your committee's bill permits the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to consider ineligiblea family that has substantial gross income from a trade or business.b. Income(1) Meaning of income.\u2014Earned income is definedas remuneration from employment andnet earnings from self-employment. Earned income from employment excludes certain items thatare also excluded from covered wages under old-age, survivors, and disability insurance.Net earnings from self-employment are defined in the bill by refer- ence to the present definition applicable to old-age, survivors, and disability insurance, with the exception of certain provisions of the old-age, survivors, and disability insurance definition whichyour 14committee believes inappropriate for the family assistance plan, suchas the special provisionunder which a farmer's net income may bepresumed to be a given percent of his gross income.Under your committee's bill, certain items are specifically includedin unearned income in order to avoid the necessity of deciding closequestions as to whether they are to be treated as earned or unearned.Thus, annuities (which frequently result from past earnings) arecounted as unearned income, as are prizes and the proceeds of lifeinsurance.(2) Exclusions from income.\u2014(a) Student income.\u2014Your committee's bill would provide, subjectto limitations prescribed by the Secretary of Health, Education, andWelfare, for exclusion of the earned income of a child who is regularlyattending school. Existing law, in addition to excluding the earnedincome of a child who is a full-time student, also excludes the earnedincome of a part-time student with a less than full-time job.Your committee continues to believe that special treatment of earn-mgs of students is warranted so that these earnings may help to financeschool attendance and offer tangible rewards' that encourage workhabits. The purpose of authorizing the Secretary to prescribe limita-tions on. the earned income of a student that may be excluded is tomake allowance for the fact that a few students may have exceptionallylarge earned incomes, at least some of which should go to reduce thefamily benefit.(b) Irregular income of $30 or less a quarter.\u2014In determining incomeunder the family assistance plan, the Secretary is authorized to excludeunearned income of $30 or less a quarter and in addition earned incomeof $30 or less a quarter, provided that such earned and unearned in-come is received infrequently or irregularly. Your committee believesthat the provision for exempting such income would facilitate ad-ministration since it would be possible to ignore very small amountsof income irregularly or infrequently received. A small cash gift, forexample, could be excluded. Similarly, earnings within the $30 quar-terly limits from occasional work, such as babysitting, performed onan irregular or infrequentbasis, could be excluded.(c) Child care expenses.\u2014Your committee's bill would provide forthe excluaion of an amount of earned income of a family equal to allor part (according to aschedule prescribed by the Secretary) of thecost of child care which was necessary for securing or continuingmanpower training, vocational rehabilitation, or employment. Yourcommittee believes that, since child care is frequently costly, failureto exclude the cost of this care from income in determining the amountof the family assistance payment might well create a disincentive,if not a total barrier, to employment on the part of some mothers.Under other provisions in the bill the Secretary of Health, Education,and Welfare is required to assure that child care is available formothers who are in training.(d) Fir8t $720ofearnings a year plus one-half of the remainder.\u2014Under present AFDC programs, a State is required to disregardstudent income, necessary expenses of employment, and the first $30a month of the total of thefamily's earned income plus one-third ofthe remainder of such income. (In addition, a State may, but is notrequired to, disregard not more than $5 per month of additional 15income.) Your committee's bill provides for removing the presentprovisions and provides instead for exempting the first $720 per year(or proportionately smaller amounts for shorter periods) of earnedincome of the family in determining the amount of the family assist-ance payment. This exclusion is intended to take account of work-related expenses and to avoid any disincentive to employment thatsuch expenses\u2014for example, the cost of transportation, lunches, andemployment taxes\u2014might otherwise create. The bill would also exclude one-half of the family's earned income above the exemptamount. (As indicated above the earned income of a student wouldgenerally be excluded entirely). Your committee believes that thistreatment of earned income would set a uniform standard and providea strong incentive both to take employment or to increase employmentactivity.(e) Other aid based on need.\u2014Your committee's bill would providethat food stamps and other assistance (not including veterans' pen- sions) provided on a basis of need by a public or private agency wouldhave no effect on the amount of the family assistance payment. Yourcommittee believes that any other policy would tend to have a circulareffect and would render the food stamps or other assistance largelymeaningless. (Seep. 30 for further discussion of the correlation offamily assistance payments and food stamps.) Veterans' pensionsbased on a test of income, though, would be included in determininga family's income under the family assistance plan. Your committeebelieves that it is preferable to keep the long-established veterans'pension program intact by requiring that family assistance benefitsbe reduced dollar for dollar by the amount of any veterans' pensionreceived by a family member.(f) Training allowances.\u2014The bill would exclude from income theallowances provided by the Secretary of Labor to individuals under-going traimng. If the family assistance benefits were reduced on account of receipt of these allowances, their purpose, which is toprovide an incentive for training, would be largely nullified. Trainingincentive allowances for individuals undergoing vocational rehabili-tation are intended to be excluded.(g) Scholarships and fellowships.\u2014The bill would exclude fromconsideration as income any portion of a scholarship or fellowshipreceived for use in paying the costs of tuition and fees at any educa-tional institution. Any portion of such payments which are used for general living expenses, however, would be included as unearned income. Your committee believes that if the portions of any scholar- ship or fellowship which are earmarked for costs to the educationalinstitution were treated as family income, the objective of the scholar-ship or grant might well be defeated.(h) Hcme prod'uce.\u2014The bill would provide for the exclusion ofhome produce of a family used by the household for its own consump- tion. This provision is necessary to avoid the administrative difficultiesin evaluating the value of such home produce, and is consistent withthe results of studies which indicate that there is generally very little net financial gain from home produce consumed at home.c. Resources(1) Exclusions from resources.\u2014Under present law there is a wide variation in the manner in which resources, such as a person's home, are treated by the State public assistance programs. Many States 16exclude the home as a resource while others consider the home onlyif its value exceeds a specified amount. Household goods, and personaleffects are generally excluded under present programs. Your com-mittee believes tht a family's home, household goods, and personalproperty, as well as other property which is essential to a family'smeans of self-support, should not be considered resources and the billso provides. Since one of the purposes of the bill is to help families taketheir place as productive members of society, it seems appropriate toremove disincentives to homeownership and to the accumulation ofother reasonable personal effects. The exclusion of resources essentialto a family's means of self-support, such as an automobile needed forpurposes of employment, the tools of a tradesman, or the machineryof a farmer, is, of course, also important from the standpoint of theobjective of strengthening the family's capacity for self-support.(2) Dispositionofresources.\u2014Under the bill, other types of prop-erty would be subject to a $1,500 limitation. Families with resourceswhich are readily negotiable, such as stocks or bonds, can generallydispose of such resources and should be expected to dispose of re-sources above the $1,500 limitation before they are considered eligiblefor family assistance payments. Proceeds from the disposal of suchresources would, of course, be expected to be used by the familyfor their support and would be counted as cash income, which wouldbe considered in determining the family eligibility for assistance andthe payment amount. The disposal of certain other types of assets,such as buildings or land, would often require some time. Yourcommittee's bill, therefore, would authorize the Secretary of Health,Education, and Welfare to prescribe time limits governing the dis-position of various kinds of property and to make conditional familyassistance payments during the time allotted for the disposal of theproperty in question. Income received from the disposition of resourceswould be expected to be used to support the family and would beconsidered to have been received during the period when the familywas receiving conditional family assistance payments, and the familywould be obliged to repay overpayments made to it subject to theconditions set forth in the provisions of the bill governing overpay-ments.d. Meaning of family and child(1) Composition of family.\u2014Numerous witnesses who appearedbefore your committee expressed their deep concern over the effectsof the present AFDC program and stated that it is characterized byincentives to family breakup and by the inequitable exclusion fromassistance of poor families in which the father is employed.The definition of family in the bill would eliminate the eligibility re-quirements in existing law under which families with children are eligi-ble for assistance only if the child rs living with designated relatives andis dependent by reason of the death, continued absence, or incapacityof a parent or, on an optional basis with the States, the unemploy-ment of a father. Under the bill, a father could remain with hisfamily, and even if he were employed, he and his family could beeligible for benefits under the family assistance plan if the othereligibility conditions are met.As indicated by the term \"family assistance,\" the new programwould be based upon the existence of a family unit. The presence of a 17child in the household would be the key to eligibility. When a family meets the income and resources tests, payments under the plan wouldbe made for all members who were related by blood, marriage, or adop- tion, as long as they were living in the same residence and as long as at least one family memberwas under age 18, or under 21 if regularlyattending school.The bill would require that at least one child not be married toanother family, member and also that this same child be in the care of or dependent upon another family member in order to qualify thefamily for benefits. This would avoid making l)aYmeflts to a family consisting only of a husband and wife where the wife is under age 18or a student. It would also avoid paynent of benefits in situationswhere, for example, two brothers were living together and attendingcollege on scholarships with neither being dependent upon nor sup- ported by the other.Although generally family members must be living in the same placeof residence in order to qualify as a family for benefit purposes, thebill provides that a parent of a child living in the family residence, or the spouse of such a parent, who is temporarily away from home forthe purpose of engaging in or seeking employment (including militaryservice) or self-employment, would nevertheless be considered to beliving in the home where such child resides. Your committee believesthat it is clearly reasonable to consider such an individual as a family member and to consider any income he may have as income to thefamily.If such a provision were not included, temporary absence from thehome could disqualify the parent as a family member, with the resultthat the absent individual's income would not automatically be con-sidered income to the family. Moreover, if the absent parent were theonly parent in the family, a child who is temporarily left with a non-relative by this parent while he is 'away working or seeking work wouldbe ineligible for benefits until the parent returned.(2) Definition of chjld.\u2014The bill defines a child as an individualwho is under age 18 or under age 21 and a full-time student. There isno substantive difference between this definition and the definition inexisting law.(3) Determination of family relationsliips.\u2014Your committee's billfollows the most usual approach of programs that make paymentsbased on relationship\u2014namely, basing determinations of relationshipon State law. Under public assistance, each State, of course, applies itsown laws bearing on the determination of relationships. Determina-tions of relationships under the social security program and the vet-erans' programs also are based on applicable State laws (those gov-erning marriage and adoption as well as State intestacy laws). Underyour committee's bill, the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfarewould have the authority to determine which State's law would begoverning in particular cases and the Secretary could decide whetherthe law of the State in which the child was born or the law of the Statein which the parents were married was to be used in determiningwhether a child was the child of another family member. The Secretarywould also have the 'authority to determine, for example, which oftwo laws of the same State would be most appropriate in determiningthe relationships in a particular family. 18(4) Income and resonrees of noncontributing adult.\u2014Your commit-tee's bill would exclude from consideration, in determining eligibilityfor, and the amount of, benefits under the family assistance planthe mcome and resources of any individual which are not availableto the rest of the family. An individual whose income and resourcesare not so available would not be considered a family member and thebenefit amount payable to the family would be computed withoutcountmg him. However, this rule would not apply to parents (or theirspouses) since their income and resources should ordinarily be availableto the family and since the exclusion of their income or resourcesmight easily lead to abuses of the system.(5) Recipients of aid to the aged, blind, and disabled.\u2014Your com-mittee's bill continues the usual rule against payment of benefits undermore than one of the Federal-State public assistance plans by excludingfrom benefits under the family assistance plan any individual whoelects to receive aid under the title XVI plan (assistance for needyadults). (A similar prohibition in title XVI against duplication iscontinued from existing law.)e. Payments and proceduresUnder your committee's bill, payment would be made to one ormore members of a qualifiedfamily, or to another interested person,at such times and in such installments as the Secretary determines.Appropriate adjustments in future payments, or recovery from orpayment to the family, would be made to rectify overpayments andunderpayments.The Secretary would reseribe regulations regarding the filing ofapplications and supplying of data to determine eligibility of afamily and the amounts for which the family is eligible. Beneficiarieswould be required to report events or changes of circumstancesaffecting eligibility or the amount of benefits. When reports by bene-ficiaries are delayed too long or are too inaccurate, part or all of theresulting benefit payments could be treated as recoverable overpay-monts.(1) Payment of benefits.\u2014It is. the intent of your committee thatpayments would ordinarily be made (after determination of eligibilityand registration for manpower training, services, and employment) ona monthly basis to thehead of the family. To take account of diversef:mily situations and to facilitate administration, however, a provi-sin in the bill would allow the Secretary to make payments to othermembers of the family or to other interested persons, and also to makepayments at such times and in such installments (e.g., semimonthly,quarterly, semiannually, or annually) as might be indicated by thecircumstances. For examIe, a quarterly payment could be made tofacilitate administration in situations where the family would, be-cause of earnings, beeligible for only a small monthly payment.To further facilitate administration, your committee's bill wouldpermit establishment of ranges of income\u2014that is, permit use ofincome brackets\u2014withinwhich a single benefit amount would apply.(2) Overpayments and underpayments.\u2014Your committee's bill wouldpermit adjustments on account of overpayments or underpaymentsto be made by adjusting future benefits of the family or by recoveryfrom any family member. The bill, however, would preclude re-covery of overpayments where the family is without fault and re- 19covery would either defeat the purpose of the family assistance plan orbe against equity and good conscience or (because of the small amountinvolved) impede efficient or effective administration.Your committee believes that, generally, determinations of \"with-out, fault\" would be made on an individual basis, and in determiningwhether an individual is without fault, the Secretary could be expectedto consider an individual's age, education, and physical and mentalcondition. An individual would not be found to be without faultif an incorrect payment which was made to him or on his behalfresulted from his statement which he knew or should have known tobe incorrect or from his failure to furnish information which he knewor should have known to be material, or from his acceptance of pay-ment which he either knew or could have been expected to know wasincorrect.(3) Hearings and review.\u2014Your committee's bill requires that therebe notice and opportunity for hearings to any individual who disagreeswith any determination with respect to eligibility for payments, thenumber of members of the family, or the amount of the payments.The individual would have to request the hearing within 30 days.Decisions would be rendered within 90 days following a properlysubmitted request, and although families already receiving assistancepayments would continue to do so while their hearing is pending, suchpayments would be considered overpayments if the Secretary's initialdetermination were sustained. Final determination of the Secretarywould be subject to judicial review in Federal district court; however,determinations as to the facts which the Secretary makes after a hear-ing provided by him would not be subject to review by the court.(4) Applications andfurnishingof information by families.\u2014To enable the Secretary to obtain the information needed to determineeligibility or payment amount, your committee's bill would authorizethe Secretary to require that individuals file applications, furnishevidence, and report events and changes that might affect eligibilityor payment amounts. Since it would be necessary, to a substantialextent, to rely on information supplied by recipients, it seems im-portant to your committee to encourage accurate and prompt re-porting. Therefore, your committee's bill would authorize the Secretaryto prescribe those situations where failure to report or the ffling ofdelayed or inaccurate reports would result in the treatment of pay-ments to the family as overpayments and subject to full recovery, itis the committee's intention that the Secretary provide for tight ad-ministration of the processing of claims under the program and thatto the extent feasible methods adopted be as detailed and effectiveas those that have been utilized to substantiate applications under theold-age, survivors, and disability insurance program.(5) Furniehing of information, by other agencies.\u2014In determiningeligibility and the amount of payments under your committee'sbill, the Secretary would verify the information on income and otherinformation given by the claimant. Several Federal agencies haveinformation that may be useful for this purpose. Information oncertain benefits and payments could be obtained from the SocialSecurity Administration and from other Federal agencies such as theRailroad Retirement Board and the Veterans' Administration. TheSocial Security Administration has direct access to information aboutearnings from employment and self-employment covered by social H. Rpt. 91\u2014904 O\u20144 20security. If a recipient has income other than from earnings coveredby social security, information from another source would be requiredin oider to verify information given by the claimant. The TreasuryDepartment would be able to furnish data from income tax returns.Your committee's bill would require the head of any Federal agencyto provide information needed, by the Secretary to verify informationaffectmg eligibility or payment amount.f.Registrationand referral of family members for manpower services,training, and employmentYour committee believes that registration for work and training isa very essential part of the family assistance plan. While the present AFDC program contains a registration requirement, it has beenimplemented as was intended. This requirement is strengthened in thecommittee bill.Present law has a general requirement that State welfare agenciesrefer those persons for registration whom they deem \"appropriate,\"with several categories of persons specifically excluded. State agencieshave taken varying attitudes toward who is appropriate for referral,with some taking an extremely restrictive approach and thus cripplingthe training effort.Under the bill reported by yoUr committee, the word \"appropriate\"is removed from the law, and only clearly specified groups are exemptfrom registration. This will strengthen the work requirement and atthe same time provide for nationally uniform admimstration insuringthat all persons appropriate for training and employment programswill be seen by the employment service offices.Your committee believes that in the administration of the registra-tion provisions, there should be enough flexibility to assure the efficientoperation of the training and employment provisions of the bill. Thismeans that short forms could be used for the initial registration. Em- ployment service representatives should be stationed in the officesadministering family assistance benefits to insure prompt registra-tion at the time of application for payments.It is the intention of the committee that employability plans bedeveloped for registered recipients as piomptly as possible. However,in order to assure orderly and effective admmistration of the man-power programs, the bill authorizes the Secretary of Labor to establishpriorities for developing employability plans.The committee recognizes that in the development of employabiitplans, there are factors over which the Secretary has no control, sucas the condition of the labor market. In setting priorities for developingemployability plans, the Secretary will need to take these factors intoaccount, in addition to such considerations as family status and per-sonal characteristics of the individual. Mothers who volunteer will begiven the same consideration for participation as those who arereferred on a mandatory basis.Your committee specifically deleted a provision of the administra-tion bill exempting the working poor from registering with the em-ploynient service. Requiring the working poor to register will provideassurance that every able-bodied individual in family assistance fami-lies will be registered for employment, except mothers with preschoolchildren or persons who must care for a disabled individual in thehome. In addition, registration will aid the employment service inassisting the working poor in upgrading their skills and income. 21An individual required to register and who does not do so would not be counted as a member of the family for purposes of determining the amount of benefits, but any income that he has would be countedas a part of the family's income. An individual refusing to registerwould not be paid any part of the family assistance payment; theSecretary could, if he deemed it appropriate, pay the family's benefits to a person who is not a member of the family, but who is interested in,or concerned with, its welfare. These provisions closely follow thosein present law.Exclusions from the requirement to register would be made in thecase of individuals who are so ill, incapacitated or of advanced agethat they are unable to engage in gainful employment. The Secretaryof Health, Education, and Welfare could by regulation prescribewhen the age of a particular person, taking into account the person'shealth, education, and former training and any other pertiinent conditions, was so advanced as to make registration unnecessary. In the case of any individual who is not required to register because ofincapacity, provision is made for referral to the vocational rehabilita-tion agency so that rehabilitation for employment can be initiated. All existing rehabilitation services available should be applied inorder to enhance the individual's capacity for self-support. Theprimary objective of rehabilitation services should be economicself-sufficiency through gainful employment. The vocational rehabili-tation agency will make initial determinations of incapacity whichprecludes the individual from gainful employment, in a manner similar to that followed under present law by the Social SecurityAdministration where the vocational rehabilitation agency makes initial disability determinations under the social security law. Subse-quent review of the individual's incapacity and continuing need forvocational rehabilitation services would be made as necessary by the State agency, or, in the case of an individual who is not totally andpermanently disabled, at least once each quarter.Your committee believes that the effectiveness of the training andemployment programs in the bill will be materially enhanced by theprovisions requiring that persons not referred to the Department ofLabor because of incapacity be referred to the vocational rehabilitationprogram. This program has demonstrated that large numbers ofpersons with vocational handicaps can, with medical \u00e1are, counseling,and training around their handicaps, be made wholly or largely eco- nomically independent. The requirements for referral are the same as for persons being sent directly to manpower agencies. Undoubtedlysome of the individuals initially sent to manpower agencies will befound to need vocational rehabilitation services before other trainingand placement can be effective. Such referrals can and should be madeunder the authority in the bill. Penalties equal to those for failure toparticipate in other manpower programs are appropriate and the billso provides.Your committee's bill would also exclude from mandatory registra-tion children who are under age 16 or under age 21 and regular stu-dents. The administration's bill would only have required the registra-tion of individuals over age 18. However, your committee believes thatthe training aspects of the family assistance program could be of great use in preparing youths age 16 and 17 not attending school for employ-ment. 22A mother of a child under the age of 6 who is actually caring for thechild is not required to register. As a practical matter, the committeeexpects a large percentage of these mothers to voluntarily register foremp1oyment and take advantage of child-care provisions and trainingmcentives and opportunities. That has been the experience under thepresent WIN program.An additional exclusion is provided for the mother or other femalecaretaker of a child if there is an adult male related to the child in thehome who is required to register and does so register. These motherswill also be entitled to voluntarily register for training and employ-ment. If the father in this situation refuses to register, the motherwould have to register.A person whose presence in the home is required on a substantiallycontmuous basis in order to care for an ill or incapacitated memberof the household would not be required to register. This type ofillness or incapacity would likely be more severe than the typesdiscussed above, since a regular caretaker would have to be foundnecessary.The Secretary is required to furnish child care services for so long ashe determines appropriate when the individuals, after having beenrequired to register, are participating in manpower services, training,or employment. No mother would be required to undertake training oremployment without the assurance of adequate and necessary childcare.g. Denial of benefisincaseofrefusal of manpower 8en'iCes,training,or employmentSince the intent of your committee's bill is to insure that individualshave every opportunity to increase their capacity for selfsupport,provision has been made in the bill to insure that individuals whoregister actually participate in suitable manpower services, training,or employment. Your committee is proposing that a member of afamily who, after registration and without good cause, refuses to par-ticipate or continue to participate in suitable manpower services,training, or employment would, after notice and opportunity for hear-ing, not be considered a family member for purposes of determiningthe family's benefit amount, except that his income would be counted.Good cause is determined by examining how a reasonable individualwould act in the same circumstances. Thus, for example, employmentor training opportunitiescould be refused if the individual were ill, orhad an allergic reaction to materials with which he would be workingin the course of employment or training. A woman might refuse suchopportunities if the position offered were in a danerous locality andat late hours. Similarly, a mother could refuse training or employmentif adequate child care were not available.In establishing standards of \"suitability\", your committee hasrelied heavily on the definition long in use under the State unemploy-ment insurance laws, with modifications appropriate to the clientgroup to be served.The bill provides that in no event may employment be consideredsuitable if the position offered is vacant due directly to a strike, lock-out or other labor dispute (including an organizational dispute);if tue wages, hours, or other terms or conditions of employment arecontrary to or less than those prescribed by Federal, State, or locallaw or are substantially less favorable to the individual than those 23prevailing for similar work in the locality; or if, as a condition of being employed, the individual would be required to join a company union or to resign from or refrain from joining any bona fide labor organiza-tion. It is your committee's intent that registrants should not be referred to positions whereany of these conditions exist. These protections for the individual are based On similar provisions in the Federal Unemployment Tax Act. The suitable work provision operates both to protect the individual from unreasonable work requirements,and to assure that employment is required.In those cases where exclusion from the family of such an individual would make a child ineligible for payments as in a two-member family, your committee's bill requires that such an individual should be con- sidered a member of the family for eligibility but not for payment purposes. Furthermore, the bill requires that benefits for the otherfamily members not be paid to the individual who refuses manpower services, training, or employment, but rather to another family mem- ber or to a person outside the family who is interested in, or concerned with, the welfare of the family.The provisions governing hearings by the Secretary of Health,Education, and Welfare are made applicable to hearings by the Secre- tary of Labor in cases of refusal of manpower services, training, or em- ployment. While it is a Federal responsibility to provide these hearings, your committee contemplates that the Secretary of Labor will utilizethe expertise of the State employment security agencies in meeting this responsibility. Your committee expects the Secretary of Labor to contract with these agencies to furnish the required hearings, but your committee wishes to make clear that the Secretary of Labor will bear the responsibility to insure that hearings are held within the required 90 days.h. Transfer of funds for on-the-job training programsUnder your committee's bill, the estimated amount of family assist- ance benefits that would otherwise be paid to individuals participatingin public or private employer-compensated on-the-job training pro- grams of the Secretary of Labor if they were not participating wouldbe made available to the Secretary of Labor to help pay the costs of such programs. The Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare and the Secretary of Labor shall provide by agreement the method of estimating the family assistance benefits and making the transfer of funds.2. STATE SUPPLEMENTATION OF FAMILY ASSISTANCE BENEFITSYour committee recognizes that the new family assistance benefits, would generally not provide a level of support for families equal to that now provided in many States for AFDO recipients. The bill re- quires, therefore, that the benefits would be augmented by supplemen-tary payments under State plans. The bill provides that each Statethat was making AFDC payments higher than the new family assist- ance benefit, would be required to maintain the levels of payments ineffect as of January 1, 1970, or, if lower, a level corresponding to the poverty level as defined in the bill. The bill provides also for partialFederal financing of State supplementary payments in order to support the efforts of the States in making such payments. There would not be any Federal financing of any State supplementary payments to the 24working poor, nor is there any requirement that the States supple-ment payments to the working poor.Your committee's billwouldestablish a formula for reimbursement of administrative expenses which would provide mcentives for theStates to contract with the Secretary of Health, Education, and Wel-fare for Federal administration of both the family assistance plan andthe State supplementary programs. Your committee feels stronglythat needy people should not be shuttled from window to window oraency to agency and that a single point of contact for recipients ishighly desirable if the committee's proposals are to be effective.a. Payments to States for other welfare programs conditioned on &upple-mentationYour committee's bill would require that in order for a State to beeligible to continue to receive Federal payments under part A oftitle IV (services to needy families with children) and part B (child-welfare servires)title V (maternal, child health, and crippled children'sservices), title XVI (aid to the aged, blind, and disabled), and titleXIX (medical assistance), the State would have to agree to supplementthe family assistance benefits so that presentpa1yment levels (or, iflower, the poverty level) would be maintained. This supplement wouldbe required for all families eligible for family assistance benefitsexcept those where both parents are present, neither is incapacitated;and the father is not unemployed. Generally, this would mean thatthe States would supplement family assistance benefits for all recip-ients who could have been eligible under present law and\u2014whetheror not the State previously covered them\u2014families with an un-employed parent. Since families headed by a father working full tuneare not assisted under present law, the States would not be requiredto supplement the family assistance benefits of these families.b. Eligibility for and amount of the supplementary paymentsYour committee's bifi would provide that eligibility for, and theamount of, the supplementary payments would be determined gen-erally under the rules and regulations that apply to the family assist-ance plan. Your committee believes that not only is this an importantstep toward the establishment of needed nationwide uniform standardsfor assistance, but a necessary one to facilitate Federal administrationof the program.As stated previously the bill would require that the amount of Statesupplementation be sufficient to assure payment levels at least as highas those in effect in the State in January 1970, or the poverty level, iflower. Thus in determining the State supplementary payment amounts,the State standards of need and payment limitations in effect for Janu-ary 1970 would be applied (or if lower, the poverty level) unless theState wishes to apply a higher standard of need. If a State plan in effecton January 1, 1970 provided for meeting less than 100 percent of itsneeds standards or for considering less than 100 percent of its require-ment in determining need, the Secretary would, by regulations pre-scribe standards for insuring that the January 1970 payment levelswould be maintained.The amount of the supplementary benefit of a family would bereduced as under the family assistance plan, except that with respectto earned income the State would be required to disregard (1) $720of earned income per year plus (2) one-third of the earnings between 25$720 and twice the amount of the unreduced family assistant benefit (2X$1,600 or $3,200 for a family of four), plus (3) one-fifth (or more, if the Secretary so prescribes by regulation) of any remaining income. For example, assume that a family of four has earned income of $3,500 in a State which has a need standard of $3,000.A step-by-step corn putation of the State supplementary paymentState standard in January 1970 $3, 000 Treatment of family income:Family earnings 3, 500 State to disregard\u2014Amount set by law \u2014720Remainder 2, 780 Lessof remainder (up to $3,200) \u2014927Earnings chargeable 1, ($3,500 chargeable \u20142,063State supplementary payment 937Total income of family:Earnings 3 500 Family assistance payment 210 State supplementary payment 937Total 4 647Your committee's bill would requii e that agreements with the State for making supplementary payments would generally follow the lines of those in existence under the present AFDO programs. Generally, the plan must\u2014(1) Be in effect statewide;(2) Designate a single Stateagency to carry out or supervise the agreement in the State;(3) Provide opportunity fora fair hearing;(4) Provide proper and efficient methods of administration, as well as for effective use of a paid subprofessional staff; (5) Agree to make reports as required by the Secretary;(6) Provide safeguards that restrict the disclosure of informa- tion; and(7) Provide that all individuals who wish to apply for pay- ments shall have an opportunity to do so.c. Paymeng.s to &atesInorder to assist the States in making supplementary payments the bill provides that the Federal Government generally would pay a State 30 percent of the amount expended by the State in making such payments each fiscal year, not including any supplementary payments made to the working poor. However, there would be no Federal pay- ment for that part of the supplementary payment which exceeds the difference between the applicable poverty level and the sum of the family assistance payment and any income of the family no.t disre- garded in computing the supplementary payments. An example of how 26the Federal payment to a State would be figured for a family of fouris as follows:State standard $3, 000Family income:Family remainder total income chargeable 1, 647Difference 2, 073Since the State supplementary payment ($1,353) does not exceed thedifference ($2,073) between the poverty level ($3,720) and the familyassistance benefit plus the earnings not disregardod ($1,647), theSecretary would pay to the State $405.90 (30 percent of the Statesupplementary payment of $1,353). This complete computation wouldnot actually be necessary in the case of any State which has a standardbelow the poverty level. Your committee has been informed that onlyone State has a standard above the poverty level at the present time.The bill makes provision for annual redetermination of the povertylevel by the Secretary. The Secretary would, between July 1 andSeptember 30 of each year, promulgate the poverty level for variOussizes and types of famijy groups to be effective for the purpose ofsetting the ceiling on Federal participation during the fiscal yearbeginning on the July 1 following the year of promulgation.For purposes of the promulgation, this base for determining thelevel will be the 1969 poverty level for a family group as set fourthbelow:Family ize poverty level:1 more 6, 120Between July 1 and September 30 of each year beginning with1970, the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare shall reviewand increase, if necessary, the poverty level amounts for each size offamily group by the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index(published each month by the Bureau of Labor Statistics) for the sec-ond calendar quarter of each such year over the Consumer Price Indexfor 1969; such increases shall be effective 'with respect to Federalmatching for the year beginning July 1 of the next succeeding year. 27d. Failure by State to comply with agreementYour committee's bill permits the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing, to withhold all or such portion as he deems appropriate of the pay- ments otherwise due a State under titles IV (parts A, B, and E), V, XVI, and XIX if the Secretary finds that the State has failed to comply with its agreement.Your committee is concerned by information that has been brought to its attention indicating that some States have not met effective dates promptly forsome requirements of the Social Security Amend-ments of 1967 and that a few States have not met all of them even at this late date. It expects the Department of Health, Education and Welfare to take whatever steps may be necessary to assure full and prompt compliance with the requirements of Federal law.3. ADMINISTRATIONIt is the intent o your committee that a new agency would be estab- lished in the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare to admin- ister the family assistance plan. The new agency would be responsible for establishing and managing local family assistance plan offices and would carry out othernecessary functions with the exception of thosewhich it may find appropriate to contract with other ageacies to carry out. The committee would expect that other agencies within the De- partment, as well as other governmental agencies outside the Depart- ment, would lend their support to the extent that doing so wouid be consistent with the performance of the duties required tocarry out their own programs, to assist the new agency in carrying out the pro- visions of the plan. For example, while the administration of the family assistance plan would be completely separate and distinct from the social insuranceprograms, the committee would expect that thecomputer equipment and other capabilities of the Social Secur'ty Ad- ministration would be utilized in the administration of the fam ly assistance plan to the extent it is economical and efficient to do so, taking into account the mission of the new agency. No part of the cost )f rendering such service, however, would be chargeable to the Trust Funds administered by the Social Security Administration. Because the full development of administrative policies, procedures, and methods to carry out the program will require considerable time, and since the time permitted between enactment and effective date is limited, the committee believes it would be desirable for the Depart- ment to request an advance appropriation to cover tue costs of full- scale administrative planning for implementing the program.a. Agreements with StatesYour committee's bill,as previously indicated, calls for Statesupplementation of Federal family assistance payments. However, your committee felt some concern lest such a dual program arrange- ment lead to unnecessarily complicated and expensive dual adminis- trative systems\u2014\u2014a Federalsystem for part D benefits, and tate systems for part E benefits. Therefore in addition to re9uiring that State supplementary plans follow Federal uniform definitions of eligibility and treatment of income, your committee has included provisions to encourage unified administration of the family assistanceH. Rept. 91\u2014904 O\u20145 28plan and the State supplementary plans and it is the hope of thecommittee that the States will take advantage of these provisions.Under these provisions, the Secretary of Health, Education, and Wel-fare can enter into an agreement with any State under which theSecretary can administer and make State supplementary benefit pay-ments on behalf of the State. Conversely, the provisions permitagreements between the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfareanda State under which the State would administer and disburse thefamily assistance benefits provided for under part D as well as theState supplementary benefits.If the Secretary entered into an agreement with a State to havethe Federal Government administer the State's supplementary pro-gram, the Federal Government would then pay all administrativecosts for the family assistance program and all administrative costs forthe State's supplementary program, so that the State would realizesubstantial savings in administrative costs through such an arrange-ment. If a State chose to administer its own supplementary program,the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare would pay one-half ofthe State's administrative costs for its supplementary program. Ifthe State agreed to administer the family assistance benefits providedfor under part D, the Federal Government would reimburse the Statefor all of its administrative costs for part D and one-half the admims-trative costs of the State's supplementary program.6. Penalties for fraudYour committee strongly believes that every person attempting byunlawful means to obtain payments not due him under the plan,, orotherwise violating any of the penal provisions of the Social SecurityAct, would represent a threat to an effective program. The threat goesbeyond the potential drain on the funds appropriated for the program;a more important consideration is the impact such violations mighthave on public confidence in the integrity of the program. Under theFederal-State assistance programs, a State is required to make pro-visions for dealing with fraud committed by recipients. Federal regu-lations require that a State define fraud in accordance with Statelaw, include criteria for identifying and investigating suspected fraud,and provide for the referral of appropriate cases to law enforcementofficials. However, the procedures used in the States vary widelyas to fraud in welfare cases. The criminal statutes of some Statescontain separate provisions for cases of welfare fraud; in other States,welfare fraud is prosecuted under the laws governing theft or one ofany number of other crimes.Your committee believes that for the family assistance plan thepenalties for fraud should be the same as those provided under thesocial security program since the considerations that lead to provisionof such penalties under social security would be equally relevant to thefamily assistance plan. These fraud provisions would apply only withrespect to the basic family assistance program and not to the Statesupplementary programs.c. Report, evaluation, research and demonstrations, and training andtechnical assistanceYour committee is very concerned about the need to improve theeffectiveness of our national income maintenance programs. Accord- 29ingly, the bill would requirea constant process of self-examination bythe administrators of the family assistance program and regular reports to the Congress and the President. Evaluation by outside consultantsis also authorized.Authorization would be given to the Secretary of Health, Education,and Welfare to conduct research and demonstration projects. Since such experimentation may well involve approaches or other ideas which have no specific sanction in existing statutes or regulations, authority would also be provided for the Secretary to operate experi- ments (limited in scope) without regard to the eligibility and payment- amounts provisions of the plan. As in the case of evaluations, theSecretary would be authorized to use contractors to conduct such research and demonstration projects.The bill would also authorize the Secretary to provide technicalassistance to States and to provide for such training of State personnelas the Secretary deems appropriate to assist the States in improvingadministration of assistance to people in need. Your committee believes that the additional funds available to carry out these pro- visions for evaluation activities, research and demonstrations, and tech- nical assistance and training should be limited to no more than $20 mifiion per fiscal year and the bill so provides.d. Obligation of deeerting parentOne of the major causes of instability among AFDC families is parental desertion. To discourage abandonment of families, your committee's bill provides that an individual who has deserted or abandoned his spouse, child, or children shall owe a monetary obliga- tion to the United States by the deserting parent equal to the total amount of family assistance benefits, plus the Federal share of any State supplementary payments, paid to the spouse or child during the period of desertion or abandonment. The liability of a deserting parent would be reduced by the amount of any payment he made to his family during the period of desertion.In those cases where a court has issued an order for the support and maintenance of the deserted spouse or children, the obligations of the deserting parent would be limited to the amount specified bythe court order.To the extent these amounts are not collected directly from theindividual involved, the amount due the United States under theseprovisions could be collected from any amounts otherwise due thedeserting parent by any officer or agency of the United States or under any Federal program.The terms desertion or abandonment are much broader than theirmeaning under State law. Physica.l absence from the home and a specific intention to desert need not be demonstrated, since a liability is created to the extent that an individual's failure to use his income and resources to support his spouse, child, or children, require that family assistance payments (and supplementary payments whereapplicable) be made to support them.The individual applicant for family assistance benefits must, ofcourse, cooperate to the fullest extent possible in establishing eligi-bility. In this connection, an individual applicant will be expected to cooperate in every possible way in assisting the authorities to identifyand locate a desertmg parent. 30Your committee feels very strongly about these provisions andexpresses unequivocally its intent that all Federal and State enforce-ment machinery should cooperate to the fullest extent possible inimplementing these provisions.e. Treatment of family assistance benefits as income for food stamppurposesThe bill provides that family assistance benefits shall be taken intoaccount in determining entitlement to, and the cost of, food stamps.Your committee feels that there is some merit in providing assistanceto the needy both in the form of cash and in the form of food stamps.Doing so helps to assure that the family will spend a certain portionof its entire benefit for food. Your committee also feels that there ismerit in providing assistance entirely in cash. The latter approachprovides the recipient with more flexibility and is obviously moreattractive from the standpoint of administration since a cash programis simpler to administer.Your committee spent considerable time and effort attempting towork out a modification of the family assistance plan that wouldsubstitute additional cash payments for food stanps, but was unableto devise a satisfactory amendment. One possible change in the bill, towhich the committee gave a great deal of attention, was that of com-binmg the family assistance plan and the food stamp plan into a single,mtegrated cash-benefit program. Your committee finds that a programwhich provides all of its benefits in cash is substantially more expensivethan one in which a portion of benefits are provided in cash and a por-tion in in-kind benefits, such as food stamps because the weightedstructure of the food stamp benefit is such that the rate of partici-pation declines as family income increases. Relatively few familiesare willing to tie upsubstantial portions of their cash in food stampsmerely to obtain a small amount of additional food purchasing power.These same families would, of course, elect to take the value of theirfood stamp benefit if it were provided in cash. Your committee alsonotes that the food stamp plan provides a benefit to families whowould not be covered by the family assistance plan. It also recognizesthat present recipients now receiving payments larger than thoseprovided under the family assistance plan would lose the privilegeof purchasing food stamps without receiving a compensating amountof cash.Your committee notes that the Secretary of Health, Education, andWelfare and the Secretary of Agriculture have both stated that cashassistance should eventually be substituted for food stamps in a waythat would leave the individual at least as well off in total benefits.Your committee urges that the executive branch continue to explorethe possibility and potential implication of combining food assistanceprograms and cash assistance programs into a single integrated sys-tem which meets all the maintenance requirements of needy families.Your committee feels very strongly that a solution to this problemmust be achieved and it isrecommended that the Committee onWays and Means and the Committee on Agriculture jointly workout legislation at the earliestopportunity that would provide for mte-gration of the two programs under a unified administration. 314. MANPOWER SERVICES, TRAINING, EMPLOYMENT, AND CHILD CAREPROGRAMSSince the AFDC program i5 being repealed, the work incentiveprogram for AFDC recipients is replaced by a broadened, strengthenedprogram of manpower training and child care for recipients of thenew family assistance program.a. Operation of training and employment programYour committee over the years has believed that a mechanism has tobe developed which would make it possible for welfare recipients todevelop into citizens who play a significant role as workers in theeconomy of the Nation. It is toward this end that your committee'sbifiincludes provisionstotrain,prepare for employment, and otherwise assist recipients of family assistance and State supple-mentary payments in securing and retaining regular employment andhaving the opportunity for advancement in employment. It was also to this end that your committee first reported out legislation in 1962which initiated the community work and training programs. Theseprograms\u2014and the title V programs of the Economic OpportunityAct which followed\u2014were welfare agency administered work and train-ing programs which often emphasized work at the expense of meaning-ful training that would lead to the family leaving the public assistancerolls. When Congress authorized the work incentive (WIN) program in 1967, it was with the belief that the growing experience of the De-partment of Labor and the State employment offices in providingmanpower training for the disadvantaged made it logical that theyadminister the program.This decision has been justified in many respects. One illustrationof this is the innovative development of the manpower \"team\" staffingarrangement which makes available an assortment of specialists to theenrollees (including \"coaches\" often of the same ethnic background)as opposed to the more traditional approaches used in earlier man-power programs.Your committee has just completed a survey of WIN projects insome 29 jurisdictions, and has heard the testimony of numerous WINadministrators and experts in the field, including the organization\u2014the Auerbach Corporation\u2014which has the prime contract for eval-uation of the program. The performance of the WIN program todate has been mixed. In many jurisdictions it has performed well\u2014the welfare agencies and the employment services cooperating insuch a manner that the program is running relatively smoothly andwith considerable promise of fulfilling the objectives outlined byCongress. In other jurisdictions\u2014including, unfortunately, some of our largest metropolitan areas\u2014\u2014the program has gotten off to a slowstart. Often these programs have been characterized by minimalwelfare and employment service cooperation and, in a few instances,the hostility of one agency toward the other has been openly expressed.Moreover, the problem of competing bureaucracies has not beenrestricted to the State level. Secretary of Labor Shultz stated in histestimony before the committee:Unfortunately, our two Departments [Labor and Health,Education, and Welfare] have not always worked togetheras smoothly as they should. The study made by the Legis- 32lative Reference Service of the enactment of WIN establishestins fact. There have been gaps in communication, and ahistory of competition for running the work training program.The committee strongly supports Secretary Shultz's position thatHealth, Education, and Welfare and Labor should work with themaximum of coordination in the administration of family assistance.This is essential to the effective operation of the proposed program.This situation just outlined, coupled with a slowly developingprogram of child care for WIN mothers, which will be discussed sub-seq uently m this section, makes necessary, however, a number oflegislative changes in the training program.(1) Uniform referralsy8tem.\u2014Thesystem of welfare agency deter-mination of \"appropriateness\" of recipients for participation in theprogram and the resulting wide disparity in referral policy betweenthe States are eliminated by the bill. Specific definition of thepersonswho are expected to register with the employment service office willehmmate the situation where, according to Department of Health,Education, and Welfare statistics, over 96 percent of the welfarerecipients assessed for WIN participation in West Virginia were re-ferred, while less than 7 percent of those assessed were referred mNew York. Under the system proposed by the committee bill, welfareadministrators and workers will not be able to substitute their ownideas of who should be trained for work for the national policy laiddown by Congress. As a result, administrators of the manpowerprograms should, in all areas, have an adequate supply of candidatesfor their manpower training slots.(2) Supportive services and training expefl8e8.\u2014Lack of necessryhealth and other supportive services has been particularly damagingto the effective operation of the WIN program in a number of States.The lack of medical examinations, the lack of ability to remedy ninorhealth problems, and the lack of counseling services which mightsolve serious family problems all lead to unnecessary and wastefulterminations of participation in training or employment. Some Stateshave established units in their welfare agencies which have workedeffectively in getting welfare recipients into the program and in work-ing with the manpower team in keeping them in training and on thejob when they do enter employment. Under an amendment added bythe committee, the bill would require, under threat of loss of Federalmatching, that welfare agencies provide those supportive serviceswhich the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare determines toto be necessary to support the work and training aspects of theprogram. The bill enphasizes the importance of such services byproviding 90-percent Federal matching as opposed to the 75-percentmatching for other social services which are not connected with thetraining program. Under the bill a State must have an agreementwith the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare under whichit must provide health, vocational rehabilitation,, counseling, socialand other supporting services for persons who undertake or continuemanpower training oremployment.Your committee wishes to emphasize its intention that employmentservice-type activities in the welfare agencies should not be financedthrough the existing regular social service provision, or through thesuporting services provision which was added by your committee's 33Another related problem of existing law has been reimbursement for training expenses which must come from the welfare side of the program. This has often resulted in delayed payments, multiple checks,and general inconvenience to the trainee which have had an adverse effect on his attitude toward the program. Under your committee's bill, the employment service could reimburse the trainee for necessary expenses directly related to his participation in training, such as transportation, lunches, special clothes, and supplies needed for thetraining.(3) Comprehensive manpower services.\u2014The 1967 WIN legislationauthorized a comprehensive array of manpower and employment services. Your committee's bill is equally comprehensive as to the services made available and gives sufficient authority to the Depart-ment of Labor and the State employment service offices so that they may develop individual employment plans to meet the needs ofindividuals who have serious vocational, social, and educational handicaps. The committee bill will also assure access to services and opportunities available under existing manpower programs such as MDTA, CEP, JOBS, and other training programs of nationwide applicability. Such services and opportunities would include counsel-ing, testing, work experience, institutional and on-the-job training,upgrading, program orientation, job development, coaching, jobplacement, and followup services required to assist in securing andretaining employment and opportunities for advancement. It is not intended by your committee that these programs should provide assistance which would be supportive of firms or industries which have high rates of turnover of labor because of low wages, seasonahty or other factors.(a) On-the-job training.\u2014Your committee has been disappointedin the implementation of a number of the components of the existingprogram. On-the-job training opportunities under the WIN program\u2014which currently are running at about 500 slots\u2014have not been commensurate with the importance that the Congress has placed on this type of training. Spokesmen of the Department of Labor beforethe committee indicated that they have the administrative authorityto deal with some of those elements which have impeded the develop-ment of OJT, such as voluminous small-print contracts which frightensmall employers away from the program. The committee expects the Labor Department and the State employment services to devotespecial attention to the goal of making OJT a meaningful part of the pr\u00e7gram.To make certain that such training is adequately financed, your committee's bill includes a special provision to provide funds forOJT. As stated previously, the estimated amount of family assistancebenefits that would otherwise be paid to individuals participating inpublic or private employer-compensated OJT programs of the Secre- tary of Labor if they were not participating, would be made availableto the Secretary of Labor to pay the costs of such programs.It is not the intention of the committee, however, that the aboveprovision will replace the regular authorized appropriations for OJTunder this program, but will add to the overall effort.(b) Special work projects.\u2014The committee is also distressed thatthe special work project provision in WIN has only been implementedin a meaningful way in one State, despite the fact that the law re- 34quired their implementation in all States. The bill renews and empha-sizes the special work projects and eliminates the complex financingarrangements which the Department of Labor declares has inhibitedtheir growth. Your committee fully expects wide implementation ofspecial work projects. Your committee also believes that these pro-jects may be of critical importance to the training and placementof welfare recipients if employiient rates fall below existing levels.The bill provides authority for special work projects which meetreal public needs and which are conducted through grants and con-tracts with public or nonprofit private agencies or organizations. Theemployment records of participants in these projects shall be reviewedat least every 6 months for the purpose of determining whether itwould be feasible to place such individuals in regular employment orinotherkinds of training. The projects themselves should be selectedfor as much training value as possible so that they will improve theemployability of the participants. It is not the intention of the com-mittee that such projects be used for permanently subsidized employ-ment, and measures should be taken to move participants into regularjobs.The bifi retains certain safeguards in present law with respect tospecial work projects. No wage rates provided under any special workproject would be lower than the applicable minimum wage for theparticular work concerned. In addition, appropriate workmen's compensation protections, and standards for the health, safety, andother conditions applicable to the performance of work and trainingwould be established and maintained. Conditions of work, training, edu-cation, and employment should be reasonable in light of such factorsas the type of work, geographical region, and proficiency of theparticipant.(c) Beloc&iona8sistance.\u2014Authorityforrelocation assistance isprovided under the bill in situations where an individual volunteers tomove from an area where the prospects for employment are poor to onethat has a shortage of workers. Such assistance would be provided onlywhen there is assurance, by the employment service office in the areato which the individual would be moved, that an actual full-time,full-year job is available. Further, such jobs must lead to wagessucient to remove the family bein assisted in the relocation fromthe family assistance rolls. The committee believes that such assistanceshould not be provided in the case of seasonal employment.b. Allowancesfor individiwl.sun&rgoing trainingIn some instances training incentive allowances have been unfairto WIN participants in that a person enrolled in a manpower deve1p-ment and trainmg (MDTA) class might be sitting beside an MDI Aenrollee who was receiving a substantially higher allowance. Yourcommittee's bill would continue the WIN allowance of $30 per monthfor each individtial who is a member of a family and is participatingin manpower training, but if his allowance under the MDTA programwould be more than $30 higher than family assistance payments (plusthe State supplement), the mcentive allowance to the family assistancetrainee would be the difference between the two allowances.Under the Manpower Development and Training Act, the basicallowance is computed on the basis of the average weekly gross un-employment compensation payment (including allowances for do- 35pendents) for a week of total unemployment in the State making suchpayments during the most recent four-calendar-quarter period forwhich such data are available. This amount may be increased by up to $10, and in addition $5 a week for each dependent over two up to amaximum of four additional dependents. There are special provisionsto deal with the situation in which an individual's unemployment com-pensation benefits would exceed his training allowance.Thus, in most cases the financial incentive to take traming will bein excess of $30. In the case of North Dakota, for example, familyassistance plus the State supplement would equal $188 a month for afamily of four. However, since the Manpower Development and Train-ing Act allowance in that State for the head of a family of four is $255,the incentive payment would be $67 per month\u2014the difference be-tween $188 and $255.The bill would provide for smaller training allowances for recipientsin Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Guam.c. Utilization of other programsYour committee's bill would provide that the Secretary of Labor,in providing manpower training and employment services, would beauthorized to use other existing programs and all sectors of theeconomy to the maximum extent feasible so that the establishmentof an integrated and comprehensive program would result. The Secre-tary of Labor would be authorized to reimburse other public or private agencies, where necessary, for services rendered to persons under this part.d. Appropriation and non-Federal 8hareYour committee's bill would authorize appropriation of fundssufficient to carry out the manpower provisions of the bill, includingpayment of up to 90 percent of the cost of training and employmentand related supportive services for people registered under the familyassistance plan. If the non-Federal matching requirement of 10 percent(which could be made in cash or in kind) was not met in any State, a portion of its Federal share of medicaid and other welfare expendi-tures would be withheld until the deficit was made up. The Secretaryof Labor would apportion appropriated funds equitably among the States. In developing criteria for apportionment, the Secretary oflabor shall consider the number of registrations and other relevantfactors.In addition to the training slots currently contemplated under theexisting WIN progrm, the Administration has stated that trainingwould be expanded to a total of 225,000 slots, including 75,000 forupgrading the skills of the working poor, in the first full year of the operation of the family assistance plan.e. OliiM care Your committee has been disturbed because neces-sary child care has not been available in many cases when it has beenneeded to enable a parent to participate in training and employmentunder the existing work incentive program. Lack of child care has, in fact, been one of the major drawbacks in the functioning of the pro- gram, as was shown by the committee's survey of WIN projects andby the evaluation study of the Auerbach Corp.Your committee believes that a major effort is needed to remove lack of child care as a deterrent to traming and employment. It alsoB. Rept. 91-904O\u20144 36recognizes that the availability of necessary child care is crucial to thesuccess of the family assistance plan. The child care provisions,therefore, are aimed at making available the appropriate kind of childcare needed by families who are covered by the Family Assistance Act.Your committee's bill requires the Secretary of Health, Education,and Welfare, both directly (by contract or grant to public or privateagencies) and through a system of prime grantees, to provide childcare for individuals participating in training or employment underthe manpower program. The Secretary is authorized to make grantsfor up to 100 percent of the costs of child care projects (including trans-portation, and the alteration, remodeling and renovation of facilities)to public or nonprofit private agencies which, in a particular geographic areawill assure that child care is provided to persons entitled to receive itunder the Family Assistance Act. The organization or agency to serveas the prime grantee for a geographical area is to be designated by the appropriate elected or appointed official or officials in that area.The prime grantee will be required to demonstrate a capacity to workeffectively with the manpower agency. Where appropriate, group orinstitutional care for children attending school would be providedthrough local school systems arrangements with local educationalagencies. Child care programs provided under the act would be ofvarious kinds, providing for the kind of care needed in the light ofdifferent circumstances and needs of the children to be served. TheSecretary is also authorized to charge a fee for part or all of the costof child care if a family has the ability to make a payment.Your committee believes that the child care provisions of theFamily Assistance Act will help to overcome some of the obstacleswhich have inhibited the development and provision of child careservices in the past. By providing for Federal initiative and responsi-bility and full Federal funding, your committee is making it possiblefor the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare to moveexpeditiously and quickly, without being required to wait for Stateor local organizations and agencies to provide matching programs andfunding.The committee also expects that the Department will use its grantand contract authority to make certain that the organizations andagencies involved will provide for a greater diversity in the kinds ofchild care than that which is currently available. For example, schoolage children could, in many cases, be most appropriately cared for inthe school when care is needed in out-of-school hours. Parents shouldhave the option, too, of using babysitters of their choice, if they donot care to use, or do not have available, group child care facilitieswhich are appropriate for their children. The committee does notexpect that day care centers will be used in cases where other kinds ofcare are more appropriate.By requiring that the prime grantees demonstrate a capacity towork effectively with the manpower agency, the committee believesthat a greater degree of coordination of manpower and child care serv-ices can be achieved than has been the case in previous programs.The committee bill wifi make it possible to use a wider variety ofchild care resources than has been possible in the past. The Secretaryof Health, Education, and Welfare will be able to make grants andcontracts according to his determination of how family assistance recip- 37ients can be served most effectively. He will be able to utilize publicagencies, as well as private, nonprofit and profitmaking agencies andorganizations. Thus, both the public and private sectors will be used inthe provision of child care. The same authority will be available to prime grantees in entering into agreements within their areas of responsibility.Your committee believes that well-designed child care programs, in addition to benefiting parents by freeing them for work, can also be of great benefit to the child and can help to break the cycle of poverty. Child care for the preschool child should not be merely custodialcare, but should provide for child development, through the provisionof health, educational, and other necessary services.However, your committee is also concerned that unreasonable Federal, State, and local standards and licensing requirements haveinterfered with the provision of essential child care services, and may prove a barrier to the development and provision of the servicesessential to the success of the family assistance plan. Therefore,the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare is requested to furnish the committee by February 1, 1971, a report and recom- mendations based on a thorough review, in cooperation with Stateand local officials, of existing Federal standards as well as State and local licensing requirements, in order to determine those requirementswhich are essential both to protecting the child and assuring an appropriate program for him.Your committee's bill also authorizes funds for grants to, and con- tracts with, any public or private agency or organization for part or all of the costs for evaluation, research, training of personnel, technicalassistance or research or demonstration projects to determine more effective methods of providing child care sei vices. The Department of Health, Education, and Welfare has told thecommittee that it intends to request budget authority of $386 millionfor child care purposes for the first full year of operation of the child care program. It estimates that it will provide services for 300,000school age children at an estimated cost of $400 per child and for 150,000 preschool children at an estimated cost of $1,600 per child. A total of $26 million would be designated for alteration, remodelinand renovation of facilities and for staff training and research an demonstration projects.In order to assure that child care resources will be developed as rapidly as possible, your committee has provided that the child care provisions will be effective as soon as the bill is enacted into law.f. Advance funding(1) In order to give adequate notice of available funding, underyour committee's bill, appropriations for one year to pay the cost ofthe program during the next year would be authorized.(2) In ordei to make the transition to advance funding, initialfunding under your committee's bill would provide for the year of enactment of this bill and for the next following year.g. Evaluation and research: Reports to Congress(1) Your committee's bill would provide for continuing evaluationand research by the Secretaries of Labor and Health, Education, and Welfare of the manpower training and employment programs provided under this act, including their effectiveness in achieving stated goals 38and their impact on other related programs. The Secretary of Labormay conduct research and demonstration projects to improve theeffectiveness of the manpower training and employment programs.He may also conduct demonstrations of improved training techniquesfor upgrading the skills of the working poor. The Secretary of Labormay, for these purposes, contract for independent evaluations of andresearch regarding such programs or individual projects under suchprograms, and establish a data collection, processing, and retrievalsystem.Sums not to exceed $15millionwould be authorized for suchresearch and evaluation in any, fiscal year.(2) The bill would require an annual report to the Congress fromthe Secretary of Labor on the programs for manpower raimng andemployment services. The committee believes that an informationand accounting system should be maintained so that the amount ofmoney expended and services rendered under this program may beclearly distinguishable from those under other manpower programs.The Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare also is required to filean annual report on the programs for child care and supportiveservices.5. CONFORMING AMENDMENTS RELATING TO ASSISTANCE FOR NEEDYFAMILIES WITH CHILDRENYour committee's bill would eliminate the provisions of the presentAFDC proam that relate to cash payments for families with de-pendent children, but would not substantially alter those provisionsof title IV which provide services for families, foster care for childrenand emergency assistance. The requirement of the present AFDCprogram that the State plan of aid and services to families withchildren must be in effect in all political subdivisions of the Statewould be modified, as it would apply only to services. The bill wouldauthorize the Secretary to permit certain exceptions to the \"State-wideness\" requirement.B. CHANGES IN THE PROGRAM FOR THE AGED, BLIND, AND DISABLED1. AID TO THE AGED, BLIND, AND DISABLEDYour committee has a continuing deep concern for those of ourcitizens who are in financial need because of old age or because ofblindness or other crippling disabilities. Your committee believes thatit is important at this time to revise the programs aiding these peoplein order to improve the substance and operation of these programs.2. GRANTS TO STATES FOB AID TO THE AGED, BLIND, AND DISABLEDYour committee's bill amends the existing title XVI ofthe Social32curity Act and sets forth the revised title XVI in its entirety. Theexistiflg title I (Old-age Assistance), title X (Aid to the Blind), andtitle XIV (Aid to the Permanently Disabled) would be repealed.Under the bill the new title represents the only federally aided publicassistance,program for needy aged, blind, or disabled individuals. Inaddition, Federal definitions would be substituted for those of the 39individual States. The more uniform requirements are necessary to facilitate Federal administration of the program. The changes in theindividual sections of title XVI are set forth below.a. Appropriation.sThe section of your committee's bill which authorizes appropria-tions for aid to the aged, blind, and disabled under State plans, isamended to remove any reference to medical assistance, includingmedical assistance for the aged. This is because existing provisions oflaw preclude, as of January 1, 1970, Federal financial participationin medical assistance provided under any of the public assistancetitles except title XIX (Medicaid).b. State plans for financial assistance and services to the aged, blind, anddisabledYour committee's bill retains most of the existing State plan re- quirements relating to the programs of aid to the aged, blind anddisabled, and adds several new requirements. Among new require- ments is a periodic evaluation of the State plan at least annually, andan obligation on the part of the States to observe priorities and per-formance standards set by the Secretary in the administration of theState plan and in providing services thereunder.The present prohibition against any age requirement of more than 65 years and against any citizenship requirement excluding U.S.citizens have been retained. Also, the bill requires that paymentscannot be denied by a State, because of lack of citizenship, to an alienwho has been residing in the United States for 5 years. Your committee's bill prohibits any residency requirements thatwould exclude any resident of the State.c. Determination of needYour committee's great concern with the inadequacy and uneven- ness of assistance payments now being made to people in need becauseof old age, blindness, or disability, is reflected in the bill's provisionsgoverning determination of need. The bill requires the States' to pay cash assistance in an amount which, when added to nonexcluded in-come from other sources, guarantees income of at least $110 per monthper recipient. The bill would also require that the standard of need notbe lower than the standard applied on the date of enactment under theState plan approved under the existing title XVI or (in case the State had not had such a plan) the appropriate one of the standards of needapplied under the plans approved under titles I, X, and XIV. (It isrecognized that some individuals in nursing homes and institutionshave a large l)art of their needs met under other programs and that any dollar minimum should not apply to them.)The bill would require the States to use the same definition of allow- able resources as provided for in the family assistance plan (see page 3).Your committee's bill would also provide that the States could notimpose any responsibility for a relative to support the individual;except that a State could require that a spouse support the recipientor that parents support a child who is under 21 or blind or severelydisabled.Under existing law, a State may (at its option) disregard the first$20 of earnings of an aged person and one-half of the next $60 per 40month. Your committee's bill changes the optional disregard povi-sion to make it the same as that in the family assistance program\u2014the first $\u00f4\u00fcpermonth pius on-ha1f o the renainder.Your committee also believes that the earnings exemption for theseverely disabled should be liberalized and made mandatory on theStates and the bill so provides. The bill makes it consistent with thatwhich has been in effect for some years for the blind, i.e., a mandatoryexemption of $85 per month plus one-half of the remainder, togetherwith any additional amounts that are disregarded under an approvedplan of vocational rehabilitation. Your committee believes this changewill provide more meaningful encouragement for severely disabledpersons to accept rehabilitation services and employment within their capacities and will assure equitable treatment as between blindindividuals and individuals with other forms of severe disability.The bill would retain the present mandatory disregard of the ex-emption of the first $85 of earnings per month in the case of the blind.Also, as under present law, $7.50 in any income for the aged, blind, ordisabled, could be disregarded at the option of the States.d. Payments to States for aid to the aged, blind, and disabledYour committee's bill would establish the following new Federalmatching formula with respect to expenditures for aid to the aged,blind, and disabled under State plans approved under the new titleXVI. With respect to such assistance, the Federal Government wouidmake the following Federal contribution: (1) 90percent of the first$65 of average payment, plus (2) 25 percent of the balance up to amaximum set by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare.e. Alternative provision for direct Federal payments to individualsThe bill contains new authority which would permit the Secretaryof Health, Education, and Welfare to enter into agreements with anyState under whi\u00f4h the Secretary would make the payments directly tothe eligible individuals. Under such an agreement the Federal Govern-ment would pay all of the administrative costs. Your committeebelieves that this authority will make possible economies in operationthat are generally associated with unified administration.f. Overpayment.s and underpaymentsYour committee's bill would require that the Secretary of Health,Education, and Welfare make appropriate provision to avoid penaliz-ing recipients for past overpayments if they were without fault and if adjustment or recovery would defeat the purposes of the programor be agamst equity or good conscience or (because of the smallamount involved) impede efficient or effective administration.g. Operation of State plansThe bill sets out conditions under which the Secretary of Health,Education, and Welfare would withhold Federal funds in whole orm part when the Secretary, after reasonable notice and opportunityfor hearing to the State agency, finds that the State plan for aid to theaged, blmd and disabled no longer complies with the plan require-ments.h. Payments to States for services and administrationThe bill provides, that, with respect to services for which expendi-tures are made under the approved State plan, the Federal Gov- 41crnment would pay the same percentages of costs as under existinglaw\u2014that is, 75 percent in the case of the training of personnel andcertain specified services and 50 percent in the case of the other costsof administering the State plan. The bill also retains the provisionunder which 75-percent matching is available only when the Stateplan provides for the minimum services for self-support or self-careprescribed by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare.i. Uompntatiort of payments to StatesYour committee's bill authorizes the Secretary of Health, Educa-tion, and Welfare to estimate before eachquarter the amount a Stateis entitled to for aid, services, and administration for that quarter,and authorizes the Secretary to pay the estimated amount in install-ments adjusted by any overpayment or underpayment for any priorquarter. This continues the arrangement under present law.j.DefinitionUnder existing law eligibility on account of disability is limited tothose who are permanently and totally disabled, while your com-mittee's bill would provide aid to those who are \"severely\" disabled.The bill would also specify that whether an individual is blind orseverely disabled would be determined in accordance with criteriaprescribed by the Secretary, whereas under present law there are nofederally prescribed criteria for determining whether an individualis blind or totally disabled.The committee expects that severely disabled will be interpreted tomean persons whose physical or mental conditions substantiallypreclude them from engaging in gainful employment or self-employ-ment. It is also expected that tile disability is one that has or can beexpected to last for a period of 12 months or result in death. Thus, thedefinition of severely disabled would follow closely the definition nowused for disability insurance benefits under title II.Your committee understands that all but a very few States useessentially the same definition of blindness insofar as central visualacuity is concerned (i.e.,less than 20/200 in the better eye withmaximum correction). It accordingly believes that a uniform nationaldefinition is warranted at this time.k. Repeal of titles 1, X, and XJV of the Social Secnrity ActYour committee's bill would repeal titles I, X, and XIV, which arereplaced by the provisions of the present bifi.C. MISCELLANEOUS CONFORMING AMENDMENTSYour committee's bill would make a number of necessary conform-ing changes in titles IV, XI, XVIII, XIX of the Social Security Act.It would also amend the Social Security Amendments of 1969. Sec-tion 1007 of these amendments is a provision for passing along some oftile social security benefit increase provided under those amendmentsto public assistance recipients. The provision requires each State toassure that every recipient in the adult categories of public assistancewho receives a social security benefit will receive a $4 monthly increasein total income (either by disregarding that part of the social securitybenefit or by raising the State's standard of assistance for all recipi-ents). This provision was made applicable only through June 1970. 42Under your committee's bill the requirement would be made perma-nent.D. GENERAL1. EFFECTIVE DATEThe changes made in the bifi, other than the child care pro'isionswould be effective with July 1, 1971, except for those States whichhave statutes which prevent them from making the supplementarypayments required by the new part E of title IV and whose legisla-tures have not met and adjourned by July 1, 1971. The committee hasbeen informed that only a few States would be in this situation. Thebill would be effective on July 1, 1972, or earlier if the State certifiesthat the statutory impediment no longer exists. The child care provi-sions would be effective upon enactment of the bill.2. SAVING PROVISIONYour committee's bill assures that for 2 fiscal years after the year inwhich the supplementary payment provisions become effective aState's expenditures for supplementary payments and payments undertitle XVI (from its own funds) would not by reason of the requirementsof this act have to exceed its expenditures (non-Federal) under existinglaw for the same year. The bill provides that for these 2 fiscal yearsthe Federal Government would meet the excess of non-Federal ex-penses made necessary by the bill over what the non-Federal expensewould have been under present law. States and localities would thusbe guaranteed no required increase in expenditures for assistance pay-ments as compared with what would have been expended under exist-ing law for the same period. Since most States would not be required toincur additional costs as a result of enactment of this bill, this provisionwould act as a saving provision for a few States that would incur rela-tively modest welfare costs under the bill.3. SPECIAL PROVISIONS FOR PUERTO RICO, THE VIRGIN ISLANDS, ANDGUAMYour committee's bill includes special provisions for Puerto Rico,the Virgin Islands, and Guam under which the amount of familyassistance benefits, and all of the amounts used under the familyassistance plan (other than the $720 amount of annual earnings to bedisregarded) and the new title XVI of the Social Security Act (aid tothe aged, blind, and disabled), would be adjusted (but only downward)as the per capita income of each is related to the per capita income ofthe lowest per capita income State.IV. FINANCING THE FAMILY ASSISTANCE ACTThe cost in calendar year 1968 terms to the Federal Governmentof your committee's bill is $4.4 billion above expenditures underpresent law, the same as the cost of the welfare recommendationssubmitted to the Congress by President Nixon in October 1969.This estimate is based upon information furmshed to your committeeby the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. The 1968figures are the latest available and the reason they are used is ex- 43plained in the discussion below under the heading Federal Control of Costs. However, the components of cost differ, as shown in the table below: President'sproposalCommitteebill (billions)(billions)Payments to fansillosePayments otherTotal$30.1.4.6.3$2 6.4.6. 34444 iThe Department of Health, Education, and Welfare was not able to furnish all of the cost information presented on the basis of the figures applying to the fiscal year 1972, the first full year under the proposed programs. The costs are expressed, therefore, in terms of what the programs would have Cost had they been in operation in 1968 (but including the effects ofthe 15 percent general increase in social security benefits effective this year).This item is the estimated cost of the family assistance plan payments to low-income families with children minus thecost of the Federal share of AFDC payments under existing law.For the President's proposal, this item is the cast of the '50\u201490\" rule (explained below). For the committee bill, it isthe cost of the 30-percent Federal matching of State supplemental payments plus the cost of the saving provision describedon page \u2014.4 These figures are not in the bill; they are the figures the administration has indicated it will include in the 1972 budget for such purposes.Severalof the changes made by your committee affect the way in which the Federal Government will incur costs and the financial im-pact on individual States. Chief among the changes were (1) deletionof a provision which permitted one-half of unearned income to bedisregarded in computmg the family assistance benefits; (2) deletionof a provision which assured the States a savings of 10 percent of theircosts in the federally-assisted public assistance programs and whichalso required certain States to spend at least 50 percent of these costs(the \"50\u201490\" rule); (3) the inclusion of a new provision under which theFederal Government will pay 30 percent of a State's supplementarypayment costs (up to the poverty level); and (4) increasing theminimum income payment (to an individual with no other income)in the adult categories from $90 per recipient to $110 per month. The deletion of the unearned income exemption resulted in loweredcosts sufficient to finance your committee's changes. In addition, therecently enacted changes in social security benefits lowered costs ofpublic assistance for both the Federal Government and the States.A summary of the cost impact of these changes is shown below.BilUon Reductionin cost due to deletion of unearned income exemption \u2014$0. 4 Reduction in cost due to deletion of \"50\u201490\" rule \u2014.1 Reduction in cost from social security benefit increases \u2014.1 Cost of 30-percent Federal matching of State supplementary payments +.4 Coot of increasing the minimum income standards in the adult categories -+. 2Total 0.0The total fiscal savings afforded to the States by your committee'sbillareabout the same as those which the States would have achievedunder' the administration's proposal. The way in which the Statesshare in this fiscal relief, however, is substantially changed. In general,States which have been making greater fiscal effort in their welfareprograms achieve more savings than they would have under the 44President's proposed legislation. This results from the combinedimpact of the change to the 30 percent matching in State supplemen-tary payment costs, which helps States with higher benefit levels, andthe increased minimum income standards, which require States whichhave relatively low benefit levels in their adult category programs toincrease their fiscal effort. A comparison of fiscal relief under theadministration's initial proposals and under your committee's billis shown below.

Theseelements are: (1) the amount of benefit provided to a family with noother income (the basic benefit level); (2) the rate at which thisbenefit level is reduced by the presence of earnings (the disregardformula or marginal tax rate); and (3) the level of family income atwhich it is no longer eligible for any benefit (the breakeven point).Any two of these elements determine the third.' They thus also deter-mine the cost of the plan and the number of eligible families.Raising the basic benefit level is consistent with the desire to providemore adequate support for those families who have no other means ofsupport. Increasing it $100, however, and keeping other parts of thefamily assistance plan the same, raises the family breakeven point by$200, increases the cost by $500 million and the number of eligiblefamilies by 300 thousand. The cost of such increases in general getsprogressively higher; i.e. each additional $100 in the basic benefitcosts more than the preceding one. The costs and number of eligiblefamilies under plans otherwise identical to the family assistance plan;but with different basic benefit levels are shown below. The costsshown are gross costs and are not directly comparable to the netcosts shown above.'Actually. the basic benefit level and the breakevon point Jointly determine only the average tax rate;a variable marginal tax rate, low In certain ranges of Income and high In others, can be designed to produceany necessary average. 49 TABLEVi\u2014ESTIMATED GROSS COSTS OF FAMILY ASSISTANCE PLAN AT DIFFERENT BENEFIT LEVELS,' CALENDARYEAR 1968IDollars In billionsj for families with children only; I.e., they do not Include costs of changes in adultcategories. Admini- strative costs are not included.'The proportion of the $500 for the first two members to $300 for additional members in the $1,600 plan is maintained at the higher benefit levels.3 Does not include fiscal relief from savings in general assistance programs.Raisingthe marginal tax rate, thereby lowering the breakevenpoint, is consistent with the desire to reduce costs and prevent families with moderately higher incomes from becoming eligible for benefits. But it is inconsistent with the desire to provide positive financial incentives for work. For example, your committee's bifi permits the first $60 per month of earned income to be completely disregarded in determining a family's benefit under the family assistance plan. Dc- leting this particular provision would reduce the cost of the bifi by $840 million. Unfortunately, it would also produce many situations in which family heads would find themselves with less total disposable income when working than when not working. This is because expenses are incurred by going to work. In fact, the figure $60 was chosen because it represents the average amount of work related expenses as determined by studies of the Department of Labor. Your committee finds that providing this disregard is necessary if appropriate work incentives are to be maintained. It also finds that providing a flat amount is preferable to existing law, which places no ceiling on the allowable deductions for work related expenses which States may permit in their current AFDC programs. Providing incentives for work is one thing; encouraging workers to take jobs which, in the absence of a family assistance or AFDC program, would yield them very little additional net income is quite another.Your committee recognizes that there is little empirical information with which to decide preciselr the appropriate marginal tax rate or benefit reduction formula. Itis unfortunate that there is little more information today then there was when your committee was consider-ing the 1967 amendments to the Social Security Act.Beyond the basic disregard of $60 a month, your committee's bill provides that family assistance benefits be reduced 50 cents for each additional dollar of earnings. State supplementary payments to families eligible for them will be reduced by 17 cents for each dollar of additional earnings, if the family is receiving family assistance bene- fits. The combined effect of the two reduction formulas is that families receiving both family assistance and State supplementary benefits will have their total benefits reduced by 67 cents for each dollar of earnings above $60. Families whose incomes are sufficiently high that 50they are no longer eligible for family assistance benefits but are stilleligible for some State supplementary payment will have their benef.tsreduced 80 cents for each additional dollar of earnings above the familyassistance break-even point.EXTENSION OF FAMILY ASSISTANCE TO SINGLE ADULTS AND CHILDLESSCOUPLESYour committee investigated the cost and coverage implications ofextending the family assistance plan concept to couples and unrelatedindividuals. With a basic benefit level of $500 per year for a singleindividual and $1,000 for a couple, family assistance gross paymentswould increase by $1 billion and the number. of persons covered by4.5 million. Of course, net additional costs would be somewhat less,as the costs of the adult categories would decline. However, therewould still have to be a substantial amount of Federal sharing ofState supplementary payments within these categories, since thefamily assistance plan extended in this way would come nowhere nearreplacing the present Federal share of costs. (The present averageannual Federal cost per OAA recipient is approximatley $565; underan extended family assistance plan concept, the average direct Federalpayment would be less than $300.) Further, every State would haveto supplement the Federal payments to the aged, blind, and disabledbecause the maximum Federal payment to an individual with noother income would be $41.66 per month. Because of the cost, andbecause no substantial improvements in the adult categories would bederived, your committee does not believe it wise to extend the familyassistance plan concept to childless couples and unrelated individuals.FINANCING ADULT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMYour committee's bill does make several substantial improvementsin the adult categories although it does not revise the basic nature ofthe program.The administration had proposed a new Federal matching formulaof 100 percent of the first $50, 50 percent of the next $15, and 25 per-cent thereafter (of the average payment per recipient). Your com-mittee's bill proposes that the formula be 90 percent of the first $65and 25 percent thereafter. This increases the Federal cost by about $30million but prevents possible situations in which a State might makeno contribution.The administration had proposed a minimum income standard in theadult categories of $90 per month per recipient. (A minimum incomestandard re9uires the State to make payments to individuals, whichin combination with the individual's other income, equals the minimumstandard.) Your committee's bill has a minimum income standard of$110 a month per recipient.It should be noted that the administration proposals were submittedprior to the recently enacted social security benefit increase. Sincemany of the recipients in the adult categories also receive social se- curity benefit payments, changes in the latter program affect theFederal costs of public assistance. The savings due to the social securityincrease are estimated to be about $100 million. These savings, alonwith other changes in the administration proposal, offset the increasecost of raising the minimum income standard. 51Your committee explored the cost implications of minimum incomestandards above $110permonth. It finds that they would require sub-stantial additional Federal expenditures and require changes in theproposed Federal, matching formula. The latter change would benecessary to protect the States from incurring costs that would not beoffset by other provisions of your committee's bill'. The cost implica-tions of higher minimum income standards are shown below.

FEDERALCONTROL OF COSTSYour committee has been concerned in recent years about the open-ended public assistance matching formula and the indications thatthe costs of the present welfare program, if the program is left un-changed, will continue to spiral upwards. The bill represents aneffort to gain control over these ever-increasing costs. Under existinglegislation, the Federal Government has virtually no control overwelfare expenditures. This is especially true where States have electedto use the Federal matching formula provided by title XIX of theSocial Security Act. Under that formula there is no limit on the extentto which the States can raise benefit levels or permit their caseloadsto increase, and still receive 50 percent or higher Federal matchingof their welfare costs. In contrast, substantial Federal control overwelfare costs is achieved through three separate provisions of yourcommittee's bill: (1) the basic benefit levels in the family assistanceplan can only be changed by congressional action; (2) the FederalGovernment will only share in the States' supplementary paymentsthat result from the use of a need standard at or below the povertylevel; and (3) the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare canestablish an upper limit to the Federal Government's matching ofState costs in the adult category programs.The Department of Health, Education, and Welfare has not pro-vided detailed estimates of the costs of H.R. 16311 for periods laterthan calendar year 1968. (Procedures developed by the Department forestimating. costs were devised during 1969 when the only availabledata was for 1968.) The Department has indicated that it will providemore current estimates as soon as possible. In the meantime, it is pos-sible to indicate how the costs of public assistance might change under-yourcommittee's bill over time. IThesaving provision would, of course, protect the States. But at higher minimum Income standardsmany snore Stateswouldbe eligible for reimbursement under this clause. 52ITnder your committee's bill, the cost components of maintena ccpayments are different than under existing legislation. Family assist-ance gross payments are direct Federal payments to low-income fam-ilies with children. In addition, there will be a 30-percent Federalmatching of State supplementary payments. These two componentsconstitute an approximate counterpart to the present Federal shareof payments in the aid to families with dependent children program.Under your committee's bill, the Federal share of the adult categorycosts is more generous but otherwise unchanged.Potential increases or decreases in these costs components are dis-cussed below.Total gross family assistance payments will be determined by thenumber of low-income families with children and their income otherthan assistance. With constant benefit levels, as population increases,costs increase; as incomes increase, costs decrease. If the earned incomeof the working poor continues to increase as it has in the past, thesavings will more than offset the impact of increasing population. Pre-liminary studies of the Department of Health, Education, and Wel-fare indicate that gross payment costs are likely to decline at the annualrate of about $70 to $100 million per year. These estimates do not allowfor the impact of the training programs, disincentive effects, a changein the rate of family breakup, or changes in the rate of unemployment.The cost of the '30 percent Federal matching of State supplementalpayments is likely to increase over time\u2014barring an abrupt reversal ofrecent trends in public assistance. The Department of Health, Educa-tion, and 'Welfare has indicated that, were these trends to continue, thiscost component would increase about $120 to $150 million per year.The rate of increase in the costs of the adult categories is unlikelyto be affected by your committee's bill. However, that rate would nowbe applied to a larger Federal share. Based on recent trends, the De-partment of Health, Education, and Welfare indicated that the Federalcosts in the adult categories under your committee's bill are likely toincrease about $210 million per year. (The Secretary of Health, Educa-tion, and Welfare could place a ceiling on Federal participation in theadult categories. Such a ceiling would only. affect a. few States with highpayments.)A summary of potential annual changes in Federal costs under yourcommittee's bill is shown below.TnLE VIII.\u2014Potcntlal annual changes in cost under committee bill'Anaualco8tchange item (million)Reduced cost of family as.sistance plan gross payments $85 Increased cost of 30 percent Federal matching of State supplementalpayments 135Increased costs in adult category program 210Total 260'Assumes that the basic benefit level of $500 for the first two family members and $300for each additional member in the 1amII assistance plan remains unchanged. For illus-trative purposes only, estimates also assume that present trends In public assistance arenot changed by the provisions of HR. I 63i1.Under the Department's assumptions that (1) the recent growth incaseload and costs will continue unabated, (2) that the levels of familyassistance payments will remain unchanged, and (3) that if the present 53system were continued the States would be willing to pick up a larger share of these iii creased costs, the net additional costs of your com- mittee's bill in 1975, as estimated by the Department, is shown in the following table: TABLEIX.\u2014POTENTIALFEDERALCOSTS UNDER COMMITTEE BILLCOMPARED TO EXISTING LEGISLATION, 1971\u201475' 19711972197319741975 Committee bill:Paymentstofamjlleswithchildren30 percent matching of State supplementalsSubtotalFederal share of adult category costTotalExisting legislation:Federal share of AFDCFederal share of adult categoriesTotal3.8.83.8.93.71.03.61.23.51.34.62.74.72.94.73.24.83.44.83.67.37.67.98.28.4 2.52.02.92.33.42.53.92.74.52.84.55.256.6 'Assumes that, with constant benefit levels, family assistance gross payment decline slightly. Other cost items areassumed to increase at the same rate as they have during the last 3 years (see discussion in text above).Yourcommittee believes that the additional restraints on State expenditures, a decrease in family breakup, increased activities toobtain support from parents, and the impact of work and trainingprograms provided for in the bill will materially affect the presentrapidly increasing costs of public assistance, thereby reducing the actualnet additional costs somewhat below those shown above.V. SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE BILLThe first section contains the short title of the bill\u2014the \"FamilyAssistance Act of 1970\"\u2014and the table of contents.TITLE I\u2014FAMILY ASSISTANCE PLANSECTION 101. ESTABLISHMENT OF FAMILY ASSISTANCEPLANSection 101 of the bill amends title IV of the Social Security Act byadding parts D, E, and F to establish a new family assistance plan.Part D provides for the payment of family assistance benefits by theSecretary of Health, Education, and Welfare; part E provides forState sujpIementation of these benefits; and F contains ad-ministrative provisions.PART D\u2014FAMILY ASSISTANCE PLANSECTION 441. APPROPRIATIONSSection 441 authorizes the appropriation each year of a sumsufficient to carry out part D, for the purpose of providing a basiclevel of financial assistance throughout the Nation to needy familieswith children in a manner which will strengthen family life, encouragework training and self-support, and enhance personal dignity. 54SECTION 442. ELIGIBILITY FOR AND AMOUNT OF FAMILY ASSISTANCEBENEFITSEligibilitySection 442(a) provides that each family (as defined in section 445)whose income other than that excluded under section 443(b) is lessthan $500 per year for each of the first two family members plus$300 per year for each additional member, and whose resources otherthan those excluded under section 444 are less than $1,500, will bepaid a family assistance benefit.AmountSection 442(b) provides that the amount of the family assistancebenefit is $500 per year for each of the first two family members plus$300 per year for each additional member, reduced by the amountof the family's income not excluded under section 443(b).Period for determination of benefitsSection 442(c) (1) provides that a family's eligibility for familyassistance benefits, and the amount of such benefits, is to be deter-mined for each calendar quarter by the Secretary of Health, Educa-tion, and Welfare on the basis of his estimates of the family's incomefor such quarter, taking into account income for an earlier period andany likely changes in conditions which would affect the family's eligi-bility or the amount of the benefits. Redeterminations for any quarterare to be made at such times as the Secretary may prescribe, effectiveprospectively.Section 442(c) (2) provides that the Secretary may reduce a family'sassistance benefits for a quarter if the family ifies its appication forsuch benefits after that quarter begins.Section 442(c) (3) provides that the Secretary may, for purposes ofdetermining eligibility for and amount of family assistance benefits,consider income actually received in one period (or expenses incurredin earning income in one period) to have been receivd (or incurred)in another.Special limits on gross incomeSection 442(d) provides that the Secretary by regulation may pre-scribe circumstances under which gross income from a trade or business(including farming) is large enough to preclude eligibility for familyassistance benefits.Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and GuamSection 442(e) is a cross-reference to section 1108(e) of the Act (asadded by section 403 of the bill), which sets out the special methodby which family assistance benefits are to be determined for familiesin Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Guam.SECTION 443. INCOMEMeaning of incomeSection 443(a) provides that, for purposes of the family assistancebenefit program, income means both earned and unearned income.(1) Earned income is defined in paragraph (1) as\u2014(A) remuneration from employment (i.e., remuneration forservices performed as an employee (as defined in section 210(j)of the Act)), but excluding\u2014 55(i) payments (described in section 209(b) of the Act) madeto an.employee or his family on account of retirement, sick-ness, or accident, medical or hospital expenses, or death, undera plan or system, and payments on an employee's behalf intosuch a system (with the payments being counted as un- earned income when made to the employee or his family out of the plan or system, but not being counted as either earned or unearned income when made by the employerinto the plan or system),(ii) payments (described in section 209(c)) made to an em- ployee on account of retirement but not under a plan or system,(iii) payments (described in section 209(d)) made on ac- count of sickness or accident disability, or medical or hospital expenses in connection with sickness or accident disability,not under a plan or system, after the sx calendar months fol-lowing the month in which the employee last worked (withpayments during the first six months being counted as earned income),(iv) payments (described in section 209(f)) made by an employer for unemployment compensation,(v) payments (described in section 209(k)) made by an employer on account of moving expenses of an employee, (vi) payments for certain services actually performed as an employee but treated as self-employment; and(B) net earnings from self-employment as defined in section 211 of the Act (except for that part of section 211 which deals withthe optional definition of net earnings from farming), includingcertain services performed by ministers, Christian bcience prac- titioners, and members of religious orders, and by certain membersof religious faiths who have received an exemption from coverage. (2) Unearned income is defined in paragraph (2) as all income other than earned income (as defined in paragraph (1)), including specifically any payments received as annuity, pension, retirement, or disabilitybenefits, veterans' or workmen's compensation, old-age, survivors, and disability insurance benefits, railroad retirement benefits, unemploy- ment benefits, prizes, awards, life insurance policy proceeds, gifts(cash or otherwise), support and alimony payments, inheritances,rents, dividends, interest, and royalties.Exclizsionsfrom incomeSection 443(b) provides that the following are to be excluded in determining a family's income:(1) Earned income of a child regularly attending school, sub-ject to limitations (as to amount or otherwise) prescribed by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare;(2) the total unearned income of the family in a calendar quarter which (as determined under criteria prescribed by theSecretary) is received too infrequently or irregularly to be in- cluded, if such unearned income does not exceed $30 in the quarter, and the total earned income of the family in a calendar quarter which (as determined under such criteria) is receivedtoo irregularly or infrequently to be included, if such earnedincome does not exceed $30 in the quarter; 56(3) part or all of any earned income which (under regulationsprescribed by the Secretary) is necessary to pay the cost ofchild care so that the family member incurring such cost canparticipatein manpower training,vocational rehabilitation,employment, or self-employment;(4) the first $720 a year (or proportionately smaller amountsfor shorter periods) of the total earned income (not previouslyexcluded) of all family members plus one-half of the remainder;(5) food stamps or other assistance (not including veterans'pensions) which is based on need and is furnished by a State orlocahty or a Federal agency, or by a private charitable organi-zation (as determined by the Secretary);(6) the training and other allowances provided under the newsection 432(a) (discussed below);(7) the tuition and fees portion of any scholarship or fellow-ship at an educational institution; and(8) home produce produced and used by the family.SECTION 444. RESOURCESExclusionsfromresourcesSection 444(a) provides that, in determining a family's resources,its home, household goods, and personal property are to be excluded,along with any other property which the Secretary of Health, Edu-cation, and Welfare determines by regulation is essential to the family'smeans of self-support.Disposition of resourcesSection 444(b) directs the Secretary, by regulation, to prescribe theperiod or periods within which, and the manner in which, a family'sproperty must be disposed of in order not to be included in determininthe family's eligibility for family assistance benefits. Any benefits paiduring sUch a period are to be conditioned on such disposal and con-sidered overpayments (and therefore recoverable) to the extent thatthey would not have been paid had the disposal occurred at thebeginning of the period for which the benefits were paid.SECTION 445. MEANING OF FAMILY AND CHILDComposition of familySection 445(a) defines a family (for purposes of parts A, C, and Eas well as the family assistance benefit program) as two or more peoplewho are related by blood, marriage, or adoption and who are residentsof the United States living together in a place of residence maintainedas a home by one or more of them. At least one of the family membersmust be a child who is not married to another family member and whois in the care of, or dependent upon, another family member. A parent(of a child living in the place of residence), or a spouse of such a parent,who is determined by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Wel-fare to be temporarily absent from the place of residence in order toengage in or seek employment or while he is in the military service isto be considered as living in the residence.Definition of childSection 445(b) defines a child (for purposes of parts C and E as wellas the family assistance benefit program) as an individual who is under 57age 18, or is under age 21 and (as determined by the Secretary imderregulations) a student regularly attending a school, college, or univer- sity or a course of training in preparation for employment.Determination of family relationshipsSection 445(c) provides that in determining whether two individualsare related by blood, marriage, or adoption, appropriate State law is tobe applied.Income and resources of nonconbibuting individualSection 445(d) provides that the income and resources of an in- dividual other than a parent or the spouse of a parent which (as determined under criteria prescribed by the Secretary) is not available to other members of the family is to be excluded in determining thefamily's eligibifity for and amount of benefits, and an individual (other than such a parent or spouse) any of whose income and resources is not available to a family wifi not be considered a member of the family (except that if such individual is a child who would otherwise be considered a member of the family, he will be considered a member of the family for purposes of. determining the family's eligibility (but not the amount of its benefit)).Recipients of aid to the aged, blind, and disabled ineligibleSection 445(e) provides that an individual who is receiving aid to the aged, blind, and disabled under a State plan approved under title XVIof the Act (as amended by section 201 of the bill), or whose needs are taken into account in determining the need of another individual re- ceiving such aid, wifi not be considered a member of a family for pur- poses of determining the amount of the family's benefits.SECTION 446. PAYMENTS AND PROCEDURESPayments of benefitsSection 446(a) (1) provides that family assistance benefits are to be paid at such times and in such installments as the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare determines.Section 446(a) (2) provides that a family's benefits may be paid to any one or more family members, or (on behalf of the family, if theSecretary deems it appropriate) to another person who is mterested in or concerned with the family's welfare.Section 446(a)(3) allows the Secretary to prescribe regulationsestablishing ranges of incomes within which single amounts of familyassistance benefits will apply.Overpayments and underpaymentsSection 446(b) provides that when more or less than the correct amount of family assistance benefits has been paid to a family the Secretary will make proper adjustments by increases or decreases future payments or by recovery from or payment to one or more individuals who are or were members of the family, with appropriate provision to avoid penalizing family members who were without fault if adjustment or recovery would defeat the purpose of the program, be against equity or good conscience, or impede efficient or effective admmifitration. 58Hearing8 and reviewSection 446(c) (1) provides that the Secretary will furnish reasonablenotice and opportunity for a hearing to any person who is or claimsto be a family member and is in disagreement with a determinationon eligibility for family assistance benefits, the amount of the benefits,or the number of persons in the family, if a request for such hearingis made within thirty days after notice of the determination is re-ceived. If payments of benefits are already being made to the family,they will be continued until a determination is made on the basisof the hearmg (or the claim is otherwise disposed of), but any benefitsso paid will be considered overpayments (and therefore recoverable)if the determination is that they were incorrectly paid.Section 446(c) (2) provides that a determination by the Secretarymust be made within ninety days after the individual requests thehearing.Section 446(c) (3) provides that a final determination by the Secre-tary after a hearing will be subject to judicial review as providedunder section 205(g) of the Act except that all determinations of facton the basis of such hearing will be conclusive and not subject toreview by any court.Procedures; prohibition of assignmentsSection 446(d) provides that. sections 206 and 207 of the Act, andsubsections (a), (d), (e), and (f) of section 205 of the Act, will applywith respect to family assistance benefits the same as they apply toOASDI benefits. Section 206 of the Act authorizes the Secretary toprescribe rules and regulations governing representation of claimantsand to prescribe maximum fees which may be charged for services per-formed in connection with any claim. Section 207 of the Act providesthat the riht of any person to future payments will not be transfer-able or assignable or subject to execution, levy, attachment, garnish-ment, or other legal process. Subsections (a), (d), (e), and (f) of sec-tion 205 of the Act give the Secretary the authority to make rulesand regulations concerning evidence and the submission thereof, andto issue subpoenas for the purpose of any hearing, investigation, orother procedure.App! icaiion8 and furnishing of information by familiesSection 446(e) (1) provides that the Secretary is to prescribe regu-lations with respect to the filing of applications, the furnishing ofinformation, and the reporting of events and circumstances, asnecessary to determine eligibility for and amount of family assistancebenefits.Section 446(e)(2) provides that in order to encourage promptreporting of events and circumstances relevant to eligibility for andamount of benefits and more accurate estimates of expected income orexpenses the Secretary may treat as overpayments all or part ofany payments made for a period during which there was a failure ordelay in reporting, or inaccurate reporting of information on whichthe estimates of income or expenses were based.Furnishing of information by other agenciesSection 446(f) provides that the head of any Federal agency is tofurnish the Secretary any information needed for determining eligi- 59bility for or amount of family assistance benefits or for verifying other information.SECTION 447. REGISTRATION AND REFERRAL OF FAMILY MEMBERS FORMANPOWER SERVICES, TRAINING, AND EMPLOYMENTSection 447(a) provides that every individual who is a member of an eligible family and who is not excepted by section 447(b) mustregister with the local State public employment office for manpower services, training, and employment as provided by regulations of theSecretary of Labor. If and for so long as any individual fails to registeras required, he will not be considered a family member for purposes ofdetermining his family's eligibility for or amount of benefit& but hisincome will be counted as family income in the regular way; except that if he is the only family member other than a child he will be considered a family member for purposes of determining the family'seligibility for benefits (but not their amount). No part of any family assistance benefit may be paid to any individual who fails to registerfor manpower services, training, or employment as required; but the Secretary may, if he deems appropriate, pay the benefits due the familyto any person, other than a member of the family, who is interestedin or concerned with the welfare of the family.Section 447(b) provides that an individual will not be required toregister for manpower services, training, or employment if the Secre-tary determines that such individual is (1) unable to engage in work or traming by reason of illness, incapacity, or advanced age, (2) a mother or other relative of a child under the age of six who is caring for suchchild, (3) the mother or other female caretaker of a child, if the father or another adult male relative is in the home and is not otherwiseexempted from the requirement of registration, so long as such father or other adult male relative has not refused to register or to participatein work or training, (4) a child under age 16 or in school, or (5) one whose presence in the home is required because of the illness or incapacity of another member of the household. An individual who isnot required to register for manpower services, training, or employ- ment may nevertheless register if he so desires.Section 447(c) directs the Secretary in all appropriate cases to make provision for furnishing child care services for individuals registeredfor or participating in manpower services, training, employment, or vocational rehabilitation under the program.Section 447(d) provides that the Secretary will refer to the appro- priate State agency forvocationalrehabilitationservices any mdividual who is a family member and who is not required to register for manpower services, training, or employment because of incapacity.Review of such mdividual's incapacity and need for rehabilitationservices will be made as necessary (except for individuals determinedto be permanently and totally disabled) but not less often thanquarterly. If the individual refuses without good cause to accept rehabilitation services, he will be treated as though he were an indi- vidual who refused to register for manpower services, training, -or employment when required to do so. 60SECTION 448. DENIAL OF BENEFITS IN CASE OF REFUSAL OF MANPOWERSERVICES, TRAINING, OR EMPLOYMENTSection 448(a) provides that any individual who is a family memberand has registered for manpower services, training, or employmentpursuant to section 447 but who refuses without good cause (as de-termined after a hearing by the Secretary of Labor, whose decision isfinal and nonreviewable) to participate in suitable manpower services,training, or employment will not be considered a family member forpurposes of determining his family's eligibility for or amount ofbenefits but his income will be counted as family income in the regularway; except that if he is the only family member other than a child hewill be considered a family member for purposes of determining thefamily's eligibility for benefits (but not their amount). No part ofany family assistance benefit may be paid to any individual during aperiod when he has without good cause refused manpower services,training, or suitable employment as required; but the Secretary may,if he deems appropriate, pay the benefits due the family to any per-son, other than a member of the family, who is interested in or con-cerned with the welfare of the family.Section 448(b) provides that in determining whether employmentis suitable for an individual (for purposes of part C (relating to man-power services, training, employment, etc.), as well as for purposes ofsection 448(a)), the Secretary of Labor will consider the degree ofrisk to the individual's health and safety, his physical fitness for thework, his prior training, experience, and earnings, the length of hisunemployment, his prospects for obtaining work based upon his poten-tial and the availability of training opportunities, and the distanceof the available work from his residence. In addition, employment isnot to be considered suitable for an individual (1) if the job offeredis vacant due to a labor dispute, (2) if the wages, hours, or otherconditions of the work offered arc contrary to or less than thoseprescribed by law or substantially less favorable than those prevailing'for similar work in the locality, or (3) if, as a condition of employment,the individual would be required to join a company union or to resignfrom or refrain from joining any bona fide labor organization.SECTION 449. TRANSFER OF FUNDS FOR ON-THE-JOB TRAINING PROGRAMSSection 449 provides that the Secretary of Health, Education, andWelfare will to the extent provided by agreement with the Secretaryof Labor pay to the Secretary of Labor such amounts as would bepaid as family assistance benefits to individuals participating in publicor private employer-compensated on-the-job training programs if suchindividuals were not participating in such training. Sums so paid tothe Secretary of Labor will be available to pay the costs of suchon-the-job training programs.PART E\u2014STATE SUPPLEMENTATION OF FAMILY ASSISTANCEBENEFITSSECTION 451. PAYMENTS TITLES IV, V, XVI, AND XIXCONDITIONED ON SUPPLEMENTATIONSection 451 provides that a State must enter into an agreement withthe Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to supplement the 61family assistance payments made under part D of title IV in order to become or remain eligible for Federal payments under part A (services to needy families with children) and part B (child-welfare services) of such title, or under title V (maternal and child health, and crippled children's services), title XVI (aid to the aged, blind, and disabled), or title XIX (medical assistance), except in the case of the working poor\u2014i.e., except in the case of families where both parents are present, neither is incapacitated, and the father is not unemployed.SECTION452.ELIGIBILITY FOR AND AMOUNT OF SUPPLEMENTARYPAYMENTSSection 452 (a) provides that e1iibiity for and the amount ofa State's supplementary payments will be determined generally under the rules and regulations applicable to the Federal family assistance payments and by applying the State's standard of need and payment limitations as in effect (and in compliance with the requirements of part A) in January 1970, unless the State chooses to apply a higher standard; except that supplementary payments are not required in any case above the applicable poverty level determined under section 453(c) (discussed below). The resulting amount is to be reduced by the family assistance payment (if any) and by any income not excluded under section 443(b) (except for the first $720 a year of the family's earned income and one-half of its remaining earned income) or under section 452(b). Any limitations imposed by the State on the amount of aid paid must not (in combination with the other plan provisions) be more stringent in result than those in effect in January 1970. If the State plan provides for meeting less than 100 percent of its need standard or for considering less than 100 percent of requirements in determining need, the Secretary will by regulation prescribe the method to be used to ensure that these results are achieved. Section 452(b) provides that in computing the amount ofa family's supplementary payments,a State will disregard(1) $720 of the family's earned income, plus (2) one-third of its earned income between $720 and twice the amount of its family assistance benefit prior to any reduction for income, plus (3) at least one-fifth of any remaining earned income.Section 452(c) requires thata State agreement for payment of supplementary benefits must provide for\u2014(1) statewide application of the agreement, (2) administration or supervision by a single State agency, (3) an opportunity for a fair hearing before the State agency for any individual whose claim is denied or is not promptly acted upon,(4) methods of administration necessary for the proper and efficient operation of the State agreement, and training and effec- tive use of a paid subprofessional staff with emphasis on employ- ment of recipients of supplementary payments, (5) reporting to the Secretary as required,(6) safeguards to protect the confidentiality of information, and(7) an opportunity for all to apply for benefits, and payments with reasonthle promptness. 62SECTION 453. PAYMENTS TO STATESSection 453(a) (1) provides that the Secretary of Health, Education,and Welfare will pay each State 30 percent of the amount expendedby it each fiscal year for supplementary payments, not counting thatpart of such payment to any family which exceeds the differencebetween (A) the applicable poverty level (determined under section453(c)) and (B) the family assistance benefit payable to the familyplus any income of the family not disregarded in computing thesupplementary payment.Section 453 (a) (2) provides that the Secretary will pay each Stateone-half of its administrative costs incurred in carrying out theagreement for supplementary payments.Section 453(b) provides that payments to States under section453(a) will be made at such times arid in such installments as theSecretary determines.Section 453(c)(1) provides that the \"poverty level\" for a familyof any given size is the amount shown for a family of that size inthe following table, adjusted as provided in (2) provides that between July 1 and September 30of each year (beginning with 1970) the Secretary is to adjust theamount shown for each size of family in the table by increasing suchamount by the percentage by which the average level of the priceindex for the second calendar quarter of such year exceeds the averagelevel of the price index for months in .1969, and is to promulgate theadjusted amounts as the poverty levels for families of various sizes.The new amounts will apply for the fiscal year beginning July 1after such promulgation.Section 453(c)(3) defines the term \"price theConsumer Price Index(all items\u2014United States city average)published monthly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.SECTION 454.

EFFECTIVE DATESection 401 of the bill provides that the amendments made by thebifi will become effective on July 1, 1971, except that\u2014(1) in the case of a State which (on that date) is prevented bystatute from making supplementary payments under the new part E and the legislature of which does not meet in a regular session closing after the enactment of the bill and on or before that date, none of such amendments will apply until the firstJuly 1 which follows the close of the first regular session of suchlegislature closing after that date (unless the State theretoforecertifies that it is no longer prevented from making the payments,in which case the amendments become effective at the beginningof the first calendar quarter following the certification); and(2) in the case of a State which (on that date) is preventedby statute from meeting the requirements contained in the revisedsection 1602 and the legislature of which does not meet in a regular session closing after the enactment of the bill and on or before 76that date, the amendments made by title II of the bill will notapply until the first July 1 which follows the close of the firstregular session of such legislature closing after that date (unlessthe State theretofore submits a State plan meeting those require-ments, in which case the amendments made by title II becomeeffective on the date of submission of the plan).The special 1950 rule relating to public assistance for Navajo andHopi Jndians is repealed, effective at the same time as the amend-ments made by the bill. An exception to the general effective dateprovision is made in the case of the new authorization (in the revisedpart C of title IV of the Act) for child care services for persons under-going training or employment; this authorization is effective upon theenactment of the bill.SECTION 402. SAVING PROVISIONSection 402 (a) of the bill provides that for each quarter beginningafter June 30, 1971, and prior to July 1, 1973, the Secretary of Health,Education and Welfare will reimburse any State making supplementalpayments under the new part E of title IV and payments of aid to theaged, blind, and disabled under the revised title XVI, to the extent that70 percent of the payments required under part E plus the State's shareof expenditures under the revised title XVI exceeds the State's share ofthe expenditures which would have been incurred under title I (old-age assistance and medical assistance for the aged), part A of title IV(aid and services to needy families with children), title X (aid to theblind), title XIV (aid to permanently and totally disabled), and theexisting title XVI had they continued in effect.Section 402(b)(1) provides that the non-Federal (or State's) shareof expenditures for a quarter subsequent to June 1971 under therevised title XVI of the Act means the difference between (1) ofthe total payments made under title XVI for such subsequent quarterwhich would have been included as aid to the aged, blind, or dis-abled under the plan in effect in June 1971, plus the additional ex-penditures required under such title as revised by the bill, and (2)the total amounts determined under section 1604 of the Act for suchState with respect to the State's expenditures for such subsequentquarter.Section 402(b) (2) provides that the non-Federal share of expendi-tures for a quarter subsequent to June 1971 which would have beenmade had titles I, IV, X, and XVI of the Act continued in effect meansthe difference between (1) the payments which would have been madeunder such titles as in effect in June 1971 if the plans under such titlesas then in effect had continued in effect during such subsequent quarter and had included payments to dependent children of unem-ployed fathers, and (2) the amounts which would have been deter-mined under sections 3, 403, 1003, 1403, and 1603, or under section1118, of the Act with respect to expenditures for such quarter.SECTION 403. SPECIAL PROVISIONS FOR PUERTO RICO,THE VIRGIN ISLANDS, AND GUAMSection 403 of the bill adds to section 1108 of the Act a new sub-section (e) to provide that in Puerto Rico, Guam, and the VirginIslands\u2014 77(1) the eligibility level for and amount of family assistance benefits,(2) the irregular income excluded,(3) the resources limitations,(4) the first cut-off point in the Federal reimbursement f or- mula for payments to the aged, blind, and disabled, and (5) the income floor for the aged, blind, and disabled will be reduced in proportion to the extent by which the per capita income of each is below thatone of the fifty States which has the lowest per capita income.The new section 1108(e) also provides that the Secretary will prom- ulgate between July 1 and September 30 of each even-numbered year the amounts to be used for these purposes during the following 2-fiscal- year period in Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands, and thatm no case will the amounts determined for one period be lower thanthe amounts for the preceding period.SECTION 404. MEANING OF SECRETARY AND FISCALYEARSection 404 defines the term \"Secretary\" to mean the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare (unless the context otherwise re- quires) and defines the term \"fiscal year\" to mean a period beginning anyJuly 1 and ending withthe close of the following June 30. VI. ADDITIONAL VIEWS OF CONGRESSMAN SAM M.GIBBONS ON H.R. 16311I voted for the family assistance program in the Ways and MeansCommittee, and I plan to vote for it on final passage.But unless we consider the existing food stamp program we aregoing to create a scrambled welfare mess.Congress created the food stamp program in 1964 for the purposeof providin food for the needy.it has failed to accomplish this basis goal\u2014and at a great admin-istrative expense. Only 40 percent of those who are eligible have everbeen able to participate in it because of its high administrativeexpenses and because it has not been made available on a nationwidebasis. The Federal administrative expenses of this program for fiscal1969 were about 10 percent of the food stamp benefit. The local admin-istrative expenses have been running about 5 percent of the foodstamp benefit and the poor have ended up with something thatmany regard as \"funny\" money.This indicates to me that there are serious flaws in the program,which in my opinion are incurable under any stamp system.For these and other reasons, I have concluded that we should con-vert from food stamps to cash payments of the same bonus amountabove and beyond the benefit paid under the family assistance pro-gram.Under present law, the food stamp applicant must put up a rela-tively small sum of his own cash (from whatever source) and receivein return a larger amount in food stamps. The difference betweenwhat he pays in-cash and what he can buy with the stamps is the freefood stamp bonus.I propose that the bonus now given in extra food stamps be givenan equivalent amount of cash. Whether the recipient receives case orfood stamps his purchasing power will not be affected, but Federal andlocal governments will save administrative costs if the benefits aredistributed in cash rather than instamps.Why have I come to the conclusion that we should abandon thefood stamp program for cash payments?There are several-reasons, but basically two.The first is that under the present food stamp bonus plan, -there isexcessively expensive and duplicative wiministration. These costscould be reduced to a minimum under a cash plan.The second reason is that the present plan imposes such degradinand discouraging experiences that less than half of those who need anare entitled to food stamps get any help under the food stamp plan.A third reason is that almost all the knowledgeable experts on thismatter, including the President and his Secretaries of Health, Educa-tion, and Welfare, and Agriculture, agree that a cash bonus is betterthan -stamps. Yet they have iailed to put forward a solution. Myopinion is that we should solve this problem now. Congress should notavoid this responsibility because others fail to lead.(78) 79I will expand on my reasons for proposing a change later in these remarks, but first I want to explam in detail how the cash plan I urg would work.There are 20 million individuals eligible under the family assistanceplan and about 3 million adults now receiving categorical assistance (blind, disabled, etc.). They would, under my proposal; be entitled to the cash equivalent of the bonus stamps which they would have received according to the food stamps issuing schedule now in effect. In sum, the added cash payment to each family above and beyond the FAP payments would be the same as the food stamp bonus they would have received if enrolled in the food stamp program. To illustrate, let us use a family of four, with no mcome except the minimum of $1,600 under the family assistance plan. Its monthly net income would be $133.33. For a payment of $34 in cash, thisfamily would receive $106 in food stamps. The $72 difference betweenthe cash paid and stamps received would equal its monthly fOod stamp bonus.Under my proposal, this same $72 would be paid the family as a cash bonus, on top of its $133.33 in monthly FAP payment, thusyielding the family a cash total of $205.33 a month. Under existing law, the famil1 in the food stamp program would have to pay $34 of its $133.33 FAP cash assistance to get the extra stamps, leaving it $99.33 in cash and $106 in food stamps. However,monthly purchasing power would be the same, $205.33 in either case. The proposal that I advocate is not new. In the President's budgetfor this year (1971) on page 176 the following illustriLtion is made,and the only difference between that illustration and with the one I have just given you is that it is given in annual terms, whereas, Ihave given you the figures on a monthly basis. The President's pro- posal on page 176 is stated as follows:Taken together, FAP and the improved food stamp pro- gram would provide significantly improved benefit levels formany poor families. A family of four with no other incomewould receive a total of $2,464 annually\u2014$1,6O0 in cashfrom FAP, and $864 in the form of the food stamp bonus($1,272 in stamps less a purchase price of $408).The following table sets this out schematically for a family of fourat the $1,600 level:BENEFITS MonthYear (a) Separate programs.CashLess cash spent food stampsTotalcishValue of food stampsTotal purchasing power(b) Merged 133.3372.001,600864205.332,464 Note: There Is no chsnge In family purchasing power except under the separate program the family ends up with 48percent cash and 52 percent in food stamps; whereas, under the merged programs th. family ends up with the entire pur-chasing power in cash. 80For a family of four at the $3,000 level from any combination ofFAP payments, state supplementation, and earnings, the followingwould occur:BENEFITS Separate programs:CashLesscash'spentforfood Total of food stampsTotal purchasing power2843,408 2503,0004082843,408 Note: There is no change in family purchasing power except under the separate program the famiiy ends up with 63percent cash and 37 percent In food stamps; whereas, under the merged programs the famiiy ends up with the entirepurchasing power In cash.Foran aged adult receiving $110 a month and nothing more, thefollowing would obtain:BENEFITS MonthYear (a) Separate programs:Cash $110$1,320Less cash spent for food stanps \u201418\u2014216 Total cash 921,104Value of food stamps +28336 Total purchasing power 1201,440 (b) Merged programs:Cash 1101,320Cash value of food stamps +10+120 Total purchasing power 1201,440 Note: There Is no change in the adult purchasing power except under the separate program he ends up with 77 percentcash and 23 percent In food stamps; whereas, under the merged programs the aduit ends up with the entire purchasingpower In cash.Theabove arithmetic, particularly for the $1,600 family, dra-matically demonstrates part of my case for changing from bonusfood stamps to bonus cash benefits.What family in America, poor or otherwise, wants to be compelledto receive over half its total purchasing power in the form of scriptwhich can only. be used for one of its needs\u2014food\u2014and this on penaltyof receiving no family food assistance at all unless it submits to thiscupulsory budgeting?What family wants even more than one-third of its purchasingpower tied up in food, untouchable in emergency? The averageAmerican family spends only 16.5 percent of its disposable income onfood. Granted the average family's income is higher than that of a typicl poor family, but must the poor be locked into a forcibleformula which makes them spend three times the average for foodalone? I think not, and I want .to detail some of my reasons as towhy not. 81As Ihave already noted, most of the experts, including the President,think cash payments are superior to stamp bonuses.Let me quote administration sources first: In his Welfare message to Congress on August 11, 1969, President Nixon himself said, in part:\"For dependent families there will be an orderly substitution of food stamps by the new direct monetary payments\" (p 106 of hearings before the Committeeon Ways and Means, House of Representatives,pt. 1 of 7).In this same speech, the President said:This Administration, after a careful analysis of all thealternatives is committed, to a new departure that will find asolution for the welfare problem. The time for denouncingthe old is over; the time for devising the new is now (p. 104).Bu.t apparently not right now!The President went on to say that the \"new system will lessenwelfare redtape and provide administrative cost savings** \"(p. 108). But this will not be true if the present food stamp program, which entails huge and disproportionate administrative costs is retained. (I detail these costs later in this statement.)Again, earlier on May 6, 1969, the President gave it as his view that \"the food stamp and direct (commodity) distribution programs ** *bothprograms are clearly in need of revision.\"He then went on to urgea $1 billion increase in spending for thefood stamp and other foodprograms.On September 15, 1969, before the Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs, Secretary of Agriculture Hardin spokein a similar vein.He said, in part U* ** Whenthe President delivered his message of May 6 (1969), he made it clear that it was time to go ahead and reshape the food stamp program and make it workable, availableand attractive ** *'Myonly difference with the President and Secretary Hardin ishow and when we should start making the food stamp program all of those things.My view is that the, food can only be made fully available and thedispensing of it workable by substituting a cash bonus plan for sta)s now.Why wait? Why not realize these savings, administrative andotherwise, by converting food stamps into cash, with the payments administered by the same agency which will administer familyassistance?HEW Secretary Finch told this same Senate Committee on the same day that\u2014\"For several reasons our ultimate goal over theyears should be to move toward a wholly cash income support systemand away from in-kind multiple programs * * *ThisAdministration believes that over the years cash assistance would eventually besubstituted for food stamp programs in a way which leaves the individual at least as well off intotalbenefits * a aS\" Why not now? Secretary Finch further said that the \"welfare and food stamp systems need to be viewed together as part of a single package and the Congress should consider reforms of those systems at the same time with an eye to their relationship to each other.\" Why not now? 82Secretary Finch is also on the record as saying that \"cash assistanceprovides the maximum flexibility and personal responsibility for theindividual. Cash enables the recipient to substitute his own judgmentof how best to meet his needs for the determination of a farawaygovernment. The individual determines how he allocates his incomeand how much to spend on food.\"Other knowledgeable experts, not so intimately associated withthe Nixon administration, have endorsed a cash plan such as I pro-posed, and suggted it be immediately:Dr. Harold Watts of the University of Wisconsin, who testifiedbefore the Ways and Means Committee, says that \"food stamps area bad bargain in comparison to general cash benefits.\"The President's Commission on Income Maintenance Programsmade a similar recommendation.The latter group also notes the difficulty of policing an augmentedfood stamp program. Since many families will have more stamps thancash m hand, there will be a strong inducement to either buy ineligibleitems with stamps or else sell the stamps or food obtained with themfor cash. Either way, there will be strong pressure to violate the law.I have not dwelt on 'the personally degrading and harassing ex-periences which food stamp recipients must undergo to get theirstamps such as waiting hours in long lines, going to outdoor windowsof banks which issue the stamps, even in snow or rain, and how theybecome conspicuous at grocery counters where they must separatestamp eligible items in one stack and other purchases in anotherstack. I might add that such embarrassments and harassments, whichthis program inflicts on those who must use it or go hungry, is doingnothing to solve the already acute and exj?losive problems in ourslum ghettoes where many of 'the food recipients live. It aggravatessuch problems.But leaving aside the indignity and inconvenience of the stampprogram, there is an overwhelmingly strong argument against it: This is the expensive and duplicative administrative cost andprocedures which could be reduced to a minimum under a combinedfood and FAP cash program.Administrative costs of the present food stamp program are con-siderable. To disperse $228.8 million in stamp bonuses in fiscal 1969,the Government had to spend $22.2 million or 10 percent of the addedbonuses in administrative 'costs. In fiscal 1971, with a projected $1.2billion food stamp program, projected administrative costs are esti-mated at $50 miffion. That estimate is prohably low. But even ifcorrect, when the planned $2.5 billion food stamp program takeseffect early in fiscal 1972, Federal administrative costs will run to aminimum of $100 million and perhaps as high as $250 million, givenlast year's operating experience.There will be other administrative expenses as well. The FederalGovernment pays 62.5 percent of State costs for certifying nonpublicassistance households as eligible for food stamps. This will soar furtherwhen all individuals eligible for the existing program take advantageof it. With a cash plan in operat1on, there would be no necessity forthis second certification.Local costs of this program, which are not reimbursed by the Fed-eral Government are also substantial. Some banks, for example, charge 83as much as 90 cents every time they sell a book of stamps to an eligible recipient. Should stamps be issued more than once a month in the future, this cost would go up still more. State and local government costs for issuance could run to $125 million, not counting the certifica- tion costs.Under a cash plan, double certification, double staffs, double hives- tigations and all the other duplicative administrative procedures could be eliniinated.With food stamps and family assistance programs merged into a single cash payment, there would be no added administrative cost for calculating the food stamp bonus and adding the cash equivalent to the FAP cash payment.Indeed, overall, there would be less administrative cost. We could save most of the $150 million it will cost the Federal Government to administer the food stampprogram by fiscal 1972, and the possible$175 million it will cost local and State governments for the same program.To sum up, there is a simple and rational substitute for the \"funny money,\" which we call food stamps and which now cost $2.20 for every $2 in stamps issued. It is to convert to cash payments and to abohsh food stamps and to do it now. By so doing, we will simplify administration and liquidate excessive expenses which are inherent in any stamp plan. VII. DISSENTING VIEWS OF HON. AL ULLMAN, HON. PHILLANDRUM, AND HON. OMAR BURLESON ON H.R. 16311We concur that the Federal welfare system should be renovated,and agree with portions of the bill that help attain that objective.We do not concur, however, with provisions of the bill under whichanother 15 million Americans, the working poor, would be added tothe welfare rolls. The aim of assisting low-income wage earners isfrustrated by the very provisions of the bill.The argument that the bill requires welfare recipients for the firsttime to register with public employment service agencies begs theissue. Neither the funding nor the administrative provisions of thebill are sufficient to cope with the massive increase in paperwork andjob placement problems that would follow the addition of nearly 3million new names to the work registration rolls. The increase injob-training slots and funding planned under the bifi would, in ourjudgment, fall far short of meeting the needs of the present numberof welfare recipients, much less those of millions more.Virtually no improvement is offered for the administrative tanglethat makes the existing welfare program so ineffective. The bill merelyplaces a new Federal layer on top of a system that is already a bureau-cratic quagmire.For all the rhetoric about work incentives, the bill clearly puts cashpayments first. It ultimately establishes the basis for a guaranteedannual income through a negative tax formula. We do not concur thatthe cash incentive, approach to welfare is either proven or sound, orthat it would ever attain its purported objective of reducing the wel- fare rolls. .Researchin this whole area is fragmentary and entirelyinconclusive.Wefully concur that the Federal payments in the adult category\u2014to the aged, the blind, and the disabled\u2014be significantly increasedas provided by the bill. We believe that the inflationary pressures ofthe economy today make it impossible for individuals in these welfarecategories to exist on their present fixed incomes.But we do not concur with the thrust of the bill in its familyassistance provisions. It would permanently consign more than 10percent of our population to welfare handouts. The bill would insti-tutionalize proverty, not eliminate it.We believe the need is for tigheter Federal standards applied to thepresent system and aimed at more efficient and effective administra-tion. Above all, the need is for greatly expanded funding of existingprograms\u2014the work incentive (WIN) program, special projects,JOBS and child care. Webeieve that these programs, properly fundedwell beyond the bill's limited provisions, can produce positive results.In our judgement, the first step in welfare reform should be tomake our present system effective for the 10 million Americans al-ready on the welfare rolls, and offer them a real opportunity to lift(84) 85themselves out of poverty. Only after we have successfully achieved a sound structure should we consider bringing millions more into thesystem.AL ULLMAN.PHIL M.

The gentleman fromCalifornia Is recognized for 1 hour.Mr. 518K. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 min-Utes to the gentleman from California(Mr. 8Mm!), pending which I yield my- self 7 mInutes.Mr. Speaker, this begins the considera-tion of one of the most Important pieces of legislation which this House will con- sider during the 91st Congress, because it very specifically represents what I be-lieve to be the breaking ofnew ground inthe field of social legislation, Particularlyas it pertains to welfare and to thosewho fall In the category of the poor. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 916 pro- vIdes a closed rule with 6 hours of gen- eral debate for consideration of H.R. 16311, to authorize a family assistance plan providing basic benefits to low in- come families with children, to provideIncentives for employment and training to Improve the capacity for employmentof members of such families, to achieve greater uniformity of treatment of re- cipients under the Federal-State public assistance programs, and to otherwiseimprove such programs, and for other purposes. The resolution also waives any point of order against the bill pursuant to clause 3, rule XflI\u2014_which, of course, Is the Ramseyer rule.The bill, H.R. 16311, is designed to amend the Social Security Act to pro- videincentivesfor employment andtraining of certain members of needy families, to Improve the adult assistance programs and to Improve the public as- sistance programs,Assistance for more than 2 millionfamilies who make up the \"working poor\" Is included In this legislation with the idea of helping them achieve sJJ- suclency rather than dependency upon welfare In the future, Training and work opportunities are provided as incentivesto millions of families who would other-wise be locked into the welfare system forgeneraUo and the Federal Govern-ment, under this legislation, would makea contribution toward relieving the 11-nancial burden of welfare payments byState governmen, H 3070So, Mr. Speaker, there are two- mainobjectives of H.R. 16311. The first is toencourage every dependent family inAmerica to stay together, free from theeconomic pressures which might splitthem apart. Second, the bill is intendedto convert the existing programs, whichin too many situations have encourageddependency, to an integrated programwhich will encourage people to becomeindependent and self-supporting throughincentives to take training and enteremployment.The Committee on Ways and Means,which reported this legislation, testifiedthat this measure would make major im-provements and reforms in the provi-sions of the Social Security Act relatingto the programs which aid needy familieswith children, Including coverage of theworking poor; the programs which aidthe aged, blind, and disabled; and theprograms which provide manpower serv-ices,training, employment, and childcare to welfare recipients.It is estimated that in the first yearof operation, It will cost the Federal Gov-ernment $4 billion-plus above the costsrequired by the various welfare programsnow In existence.In fiscal year 1972 the cost Is estimatedto be something over $12 billion In addi-tion to what the States will spend.Mr. Speaker, this Is a very controver-sial and complicated piece of legislationwhich some claim will change the philos-ophy of our family assistance program,but It is a bill which has been endorsedby the overwhelming majority of themembers of one of the greatest commit-tees in the House. So on that basis, Mr.Speaker, I urge the adoption of the reso-lution in order that the Committee onWays and Means may be permitted todebate this Issue and to explain the de-tails of the bill.Mr. GROSS. Mr. Speaker, will thegentleman from California yield?Mr. SISK. I am glad to yield to thegentleman from Iowa.Mr. GROSS. I thank the gentleman foryielding.I have the usual question: What validreason is there for bringing this bill be-fore the House under a completely closedrule?Mr. 515K. I believe the fairest answerI can give my friend from Iowa Is thatI have no basic argument to make to jus-tify It.This was a request by the Committeeon Ways and Means. I would not as-sume it was unanimously agreed to bythe members of the Committee on Waysand Means, but at leasi It was a requestfrom the very distinguished chairmanof that committee, the gentleman fromArkansas (Mr. MILLS), and the distin-guished ranking minority member, thegentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. BvRNES),for a closed rule.Of course, It does deal with a verycomplex and complicated issue.I might say, there was a difference ofopinion in the Committee on Rules. Ifound myself in the situation where I feltcompelled to vote for a closed rule onthis bill.I am not In a position today to at- tempt to defend that vote to any greatCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEextent, because, I might say to my goodfriend, in spite of my great respect.\u2014and there is no Member of the House Ihave greater respect for than the gentle-man from Arkansas, who I see is now onhis feet\u2014I have reservations about thisbill, and strong reservations. In fact, tobe honest about It, if I had to vote rightnow I would vote against the passage ofthis bill.I am for the rule. I am here support-ing the rule. I am supporting the rightof the committee to debate the issue. Iam terribly, concerned aboutthe impli-cations In this bill. I do believe the dis-tinguished members of the committeeare entitled to discuss theissues beforethe House and to debate the merits andthe demerits, because theer are two sidesto the issue. Then we can vote it up ordown.I might say to my good friend, that isnot necessarily an answer to his ques-tion, but that is the best I can give himat the moment.Mr. MILLS. Mr. Speaker, will the gen-tleman yield?Mr. SISK. I am glad to yield to thegentleman from Arkansas for any com-ment he might wish to make.Mr. MILLS. On the question raised bymy friend from Iowa, itis my informa-tion that this bill would besubject toamendment, without the closed rule, notjust for the many titles which are in-volved in the bill itself\u2014andthat Is agreat number\u2014but even for other titlesof the Social Security Act.Mr. GROSS. Mr. Speaker, will the gen-tleman yield?Mr. SISK. I yield further tothe gen-tleman from Iowa.Mr. GROSS. The gentleman does noteven talk in terms of amodified closedrule to limit it to the subjectm'tter ofthe bill, to the titles or sections or any-thing else.Is it just simply fashionable?Is ft afashion that cannot be broken? Evenmini skirts, apparently, are going tochange; they are going to get longer.Even fashions do change.Is it just fashionable that the Waysand Means Committee comesin withevery bill under a bill? Is because offashion, orwhat?Mr. 515K. Seriously, let me say tomy good friend from Iowa,I believe itis a rather complicated bill. There wasserious consideration given to a modifiedrule. It was a proposal made, for a modi- fied rule; that is, a rule which wouldmake in order certain amendments.The problem we were confronted with,as an example, was thatthe gentlemanfrom Florida was desirous of offering anamendment having to do with foodstamps, and the gentleman from Geor-gia and the gentleman from Texas (Mr.BURLESON) were interested In making inorder a bill which they have which elim-inates the so-called guaranteed annualIncome provision and the working poor.There were some other proposals. Itcame down to this situation.Frankly, Ican tell my friend from Iowa my positionis, if you are going to open it up for oneIndividual or one group to offer amend-ments, then It Is unfair to deny the op-April 15,1970portunity to others. So really our deci-sion was finally made that, all right, ifyou are going to come down here with awide open rule or a closed rule, thell youshould make it that for everyone. Gen-erally, Mr. MILLS and Mr. BYRNES andothers who discussed it made it prettyevident that In all fairness, for good pro-cedure, we had probably better stick withthe closed rule, and that was the decisionthat was made. Maybe it was a bad judg-ment, but, at any rate, that was our de-cision In the committee.Mr. GROSS. I do not care to pursuethis very much further, because obvious-ly, or It seems to me obviously, nothingis going to be done about it and the rulewill be adopted, although I think it oughtto be defeated and this bill opened upto amendment on the part of Members.The House ought to have an opportunityto work its will on It. The point is wemight as well adopt the rule and voteon the bill, because I think we are allreasonably well acquainted with the con-tents of it. Why waste 6 hours of timedebating something that you cannotamend or do anything with? The gentle-man from California himself says thatas of now he thought he would be pre-pared to vote against the bill. I feel thesame way about it. I do not see muchpoint in wasting 6 hours of time, If itcan be called wasted, in listening to it.The SPEAKER. The time of the gen-tleman has again expired.Mr. SISK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself2 additional minutes.Let me say quickly that this is a verycomplex proposition. There are variousphilosophies involved. There are someinnovative things in this bill. I am con-cerned about possible precedents andthe direction in which we are going. Iquestion as to whether or not there hasbeen a case made for work incentives Inthis bill. I think the facts and argumentsand discussions were brought before theCommittee on Rules which raised thequestion as to whether there was work in-centive in It. It is my understanding thatMr. MILLS, Mr. BYRNES, and I are con-cerned about getting a work incentivethat will cause people to want to workand go out and improve their economicconditions and support their families. Iam concerned that there is not sufficientincentive In this bill to do that. I wantto listen, and I hope and urge Membersto stay on the floor during the 6 hoursof debate, because I think It could be verybeneficial. There will be people here rais-ing very important questions on thismatter. If I could be convinced that thework Incentive Is in here to the extentthat I know in all sincerity my friend,Mr. MILLS, feels It Is in It, then I will support the bill, but I do have gravereservations about it and about the im-plications and philosophy of having aguaranteed national wage. I have alwaysopposed it, because I think It contrary toour whole philosophy and tothe privateenterprise system in this country. Thatis why I am getting a lot of mail against,and I am sure that other Members are,also. It will be a very controversial Issueas we go down the roadin this discus-sion of this bill between now and the April 15, 1970timewhen something may be done Inconnection with enacting a law.Mr LATFA. Mr. Speaker, will the yield?Mr. 818K. I yield to the gentlemanfrom Ohio.Mr. LArFA. As a member of the Corn-nlittee on Rules, I do not think we shouldleave the impression stand here that theCommittee on Rules was powerless towrite a rule that would take care of theobjection raised by the gentleman fromArkansas (Mr. MILLS). We could cer-tainly have written a rule that wouldhave permitted the gentleman fromGeorgia (Mr. LANDRTJM)tooffer his billand also one that would have permittedthe gentleman from Florida to offer hissubstitute on the food stamp plan with-out putting the rest of the bill with theentire social security system In jeopardy.I want that on the RECORD so we do notleave that Impression here.Mr. 818K. Let me say to my goodfriend from Ohio that I agree with him.There is no question we could have writ-ten such a rule as I Indicated to mygood friend from Iowa. It was a matterof judgment on the part of the Commit-tee on Rules, and the majority of thecommittee. It was not a unanimous voteby any means.It was not a unanimous vote by nymeans.The SPEAKER. The time of the gen-tleman from California has again ex-pired.Mr. 818K. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself3 additional minutes.Mr. HALL. Mr. Speaker, will the gen-tleman yield?Mr. 818K. I yield to the gentlemanfrom Missouri.Mr. HALL. Mr. Speaker, I appreciatethe gentleman yielding. I have only onequestion for the purpose of Informationonly. Do I understand from House Reso-lution 916 as written only points of or-der pursuant to the Ramseyer rule arewaived?Mr. 818K. The gentleman is exactlycorrect. We waived It only on thatpoint.Mr. HALL. Mr. Speaker, If the gen-tleman will yield further, then we willbe able, Is it fair for me to assume, tomake other points of order within otherrules of procedures of this House whichwould stand on their own merits If pre-sented against the bill?Mr. 818K. The gentleman states it ex-actly as I understand it.Mr. GONZALEZ. Mr. Speaker, will thegentleman yield?Mr. 818K. I shall be glad to yield tothe gentleman from Texas.Mr. GONZALEZ. I thank the gentle-man from California for yielding.This Is coming up under a closed rule;Is that correct?Mr. 818K. That Is correctMr. GONZALEZ, That Is, no one whobelongs to this House who Is not amember of the Ways and Means Corn-nlittee or for that matter the Rules Com-mittee will have a chance to really offeranything meaningful in the way ofamendments or modifications to the billas put forth by the committee?Mr. 818K. The gentleman speaks thefacts as I understand them.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014HOUSEMr. GONZALEZ. Will the gentlemanexplain to me why?Mr. 818K. I would rather permit thegentleman from Arkansas and the gen-tleman from Wisconsin (Mr. BYRNES) toexplain that. This was a request by theCommittee on Ways and Means, and theCommittee on Rules, after considerablediscussion and after several other pro-posals had been offered, finally voted, InIts wisdom, to grant a 6-hour closed rule.It might not have been the proper tbjngto do, but that is what was done.Mr. GONZALEZ. Mr. Speaker, If thegentleman will yield further, I do notmean to put the gentleman as an Indi-vidual on the spot. This is a very perti-nent question. I think every conscien-tious Member of the House asks himselfis there a special attribute that sur-rounds the Ways and Means Committee,since. I am sure other committees wouldlike to get closed rules?Mr. 518K. No. Let me say, generally Ido not think that Is true. The facts arethat the subject matter with which theCommittee on Ways and Means dealscovers taxes and social security whichare extremely complicated matters. Thisdoes not mean that every Member of theHouse cannot be knowledgeable. But thefacts are that it does deal with mattersof balance where a minor amendment orwhat appeared to be a minor amend-ment in connection with either socialsecurity payments or tax law couldthrow the whole program out of bal-ance. I think it has been generally con-sidered a very difficult situation to at-tempt to amend or change tax laws orsocial security laws. These are, of course,the primary subjects with which theCommittee on Ways and Means dealsThey are not covered by this blanketrule.Let me say that legislation comingfrom the Committee on Ways and MeansIs privileged legislation and I am sure my friend from Texas knows that theydo not need a rule in order to bring abill to the floor of the House for con-sideration. They can bring a bill to thefloor any time they are ready, whetherthe Rules Committee looks at it or notbecause it Is privileged. But the point isthat they come to us for a closed rule.Mr. MILLS. Mr. Speaker, will thegentleman yield?Mr. 818K. I yield to the gentlemanfrom Arkansas.Mr. MILLS. Mr. Speaker, there are .78pages in the compilation of the socialsecurity laws alone. I do not know butwhat there are, perhaps, 3,000 or 4,000social security bills that are pending be-fore the Ways and Means Committee, allof which might be In order under an openrule. There are broad references to thisInternal Revenue Code within the SocialSecurity Act itself that couldor couldnot open up the. entire Revenue Code.The purpose of the Committee on Waysand Means In asking for a closed rule,historically on tax matters and socialsecurity matters, is to as best we can pro-vide for an orderly procedure for the con-sideration of the legislation presented be-fore the House. That Is the only reason.The gentleman from California re-members that In the other body theyoperate without a closed rule.H 3071And I mean to tell you they operate.The last Social Security Act containedbetter than 500 amendments to the socialsecurity bifi, and every one of them costa devil of a lot more than we had in theHouse-passed bill, and It was the respon- sibility of the House conferees to takethe brunt of the criticism to get thoseamendments out In the conference.(Mr. GONZALEZ asked and was givenpermission to extend his remarks at thispoint In the RECORD and to Include extra-neous matter.)[Mr. GONZALEZ' remarks will appear hereafter In the Extensions of Remarks.]Mr. SMITH of California. Mr. Speaker,I yield myself 12 minutes.(Mr. SMITH of California asked andwas given permission to revise and ex-tend his remarks.)Mr. DENT. Mr. Speaker, will the gen- tleman yield to me to clarify a point ofjurisdiction?Mr. SMITH of California. I yield tothe gentleman from Pennsylvania for a question.Mr. DENT. Mr. Speaker, under thisrule could the right be denied to a com- mittee If It feels that its jurisdiction hasbeen usurped by the conditions of thisbill?For instance, let me read:This bill will contain a new program formanpower training employment services tobe administered by the Secretary of Laborthrough the State employment offices.Am I right or wrong In that\u2014that thatis strictly the jurisdiction of the Commit-tee on Labor?Mr. SMITH of California. We will getInto some discussion on that, I am cer- tain, in the general debate, but I am not going to yield all of my time on thisrule. We have 6 hours to discuss thiswhole matter.Mr. DENT. Mr. Speaker, I thank thegentleman for yielding.Mr. SMITH of California. Mr. Speak-er, House Resolution 916, the resolutionon the rule, provides for 6 hours of de-bate with a closed rule except for com- mittee amendments, and waives pointsof order so far as the Ramseyer Rule isconcerned. No one except members ofthe Committee on Ways and Means\u2014and I would assume that to mean thechairman himself, and probably withthe agreement of the ranking minoritymember\u2014couldorwouldofferan amendment.It means that none of us who are noton the Committee on Ways and Means,including those of us on the Committeeon Rules, can do so. We are apparentlynot capable of having sufficient Infor-mation or ability to offer amendmentsor suggestions to this new program.The rule was requested by the distin-guished chairman, by the distinguishedranking pilnority member, by the ad-ministration and by HEW. There was concern as to the fact that It mightopen up the entire subject.Accordingly, the majority of us onthe Committee on Rules voted for a closed rule.One of the arguments was that If therule is open, or If a special rule Is madeto open up the so-called guaranteed an- H 3072nualIncome payments, that they wouldprobably be Increased on the floor ofthe House. One Member testified beforethe Committee on Rules that he wouldlike to have the rule open so that theamount -could be increased, and one In-dividual who was a visitor In the com-mittee the first day during the entireday's session\u2014and who was on televi-sion that night\u2014stated that she thoughtIt was a good program, but she thoughtit was not enough\u2014that they want $5,500a year to any needy family.So apparently there is some feeling toincrease the amount over and above the$1,800 for a family of four. I believe thatafter the bifi Is passed it will start grow-ing a year from then, and from thenon the sky will be the limit.As to the bill Itself, according to whatthe report states, the purpose of H.R.16311 Is to repeal the current jumble offederally assisted welfare programs, andto replace them with a unified programof aid to the Nation's poor.This new program will provide finan-cial assistance based unpon a formula tobe applied nationwide.Also included is a program of worktraining for those who require it, andchild care, day-care centers to enablemothers to work.Since 1980 the number of recipientswithin the welfare system has Increasedfrom $2.4 million to about $0.7 millionand minor children make up most of thisincrease.In this same period costs of the pro-gram have tripled to about $7.8 billion.The Department of Health, Education,and Welfare estimates that the costscould double In the next 5 years underthe present system.This bill restructures that entire sys-tem. It places Increased stress on work-training programs and the developmentof child day-care centers. It requires allof the adult recipients to register at em-ployment centers and accept suitablework; and sets a nationwide scale of as-sistance payments to all eligible families.Each family with children whose In-come is less than the family benefitlevel\u2014computed at $500 each for thefirst two members of the family and$300 for each additional member\u2014wouldbe eligible to receive a payment. To qual-ify to receive such assistance, membersof the family must meet the registra-tion for work or training requirements.The amount of payment each family re-ceives will be based on the difference be-tween the family benefit level and theamount of income earned by the family.For example, the family of four with noincome would be eligible to receive $1,-600\u2014$500 plus $500 plus $300 plus $300.Every needy family In the Nationwould be eligible to receive assistance,but a family with $1,500 or more In re-sources,- excluding Its home and house-hold goods and personal effects, wouldnot be eligible for any assistance. Cer-tain types of income would bi excludedIn determining the total Federal benefitlevel. Excludlble income includes:First, the first $120 per year of eachadult member of the family, plus one-half of the remainder.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSESecond, food stamps and other publicor private charity, Including veterans'pensions.Third, all earnings of a child In school.Each family member would be requiredto register for employment or work train-ing with a public employment office. Ex-ceptions to this rule are children under21 who are in school, those who are Illor disabled, a mother with a child underthe age of 6, one who Is caring for anill family member, or whose husband Isregistered under the program.Any individual who refuses to registeror to accept vocational rehabilitationwill not be counted In determining theamount of the family benefit.The several States will have to sup-plement the family assistance paymentsup to the level of their aid for dependentchildren programs or the poverty level\u2014whichever Is lower\u2014in order to be eli-gible for Federal funds under medicaidand other welfare programs. States willnot, however, have to supplement Federalpayments to the working poor.An appeals procedure Is provided. Anyperson who disagrees with any decisionrelating to his eliglbIlItfor, or theamounts of his family assistance pay-ments may obtain a hearing. Any finaldetermination can be reviewed in thelocal district court, where factual deter-minations previously made by the Secre-tary of Health, Education, and Welfarewould be conclusive.The bill terminates the present workincentive program and creates a new oneoperated by the Secretary of Labor.Training would be provided all regis-trants who need It. Concurrently, Statewelfare agencies would be required toprovide health and other benflts to facili-tate the participation of individuals Inthe training program. Federal appropria-tions are authorized to cover up to 90percent of the costs of the new trainingprogram WIth the State responsible forthe remaining 10 percent. If a State failsto provide its 10 percent, Federal assist-ance to other welfare programs WIthInsuch State would be reduced by theamount of the State's deficit. Each per-son in the training program will receivean allowance of $30 per month for inci-dental and travel expenses. Funds tocover such costs as transportation andother costs directly connected with thetraining program can also be paid out bythe Secretary of Labor.Day-care centers for minor childrenare to be provided. The Secretary ofHealth, Education, and Welfare Is au-thorized to make grants covering up to100 percent of the costs to public andprivate nonprofit agencies to assure thatsuch assistance Is provided for all train-ing program participants who require it.The present separate assistance pro-grams for the aged, blind, needy, anddisabled are eliminted. In their place, anew combined Federal-State unified pro-gram Is Instituted to cover the samegroups of people. Following federally setdefinitions and qualifications, the Statewill be required to provide a paymentsufficient to bring an individual's totalIncome up to at least $110 per month.No restrictions such as residency or cUt-April 15, 1970zenship requirements could be instituted.The Federal Government would pay 90percent of the first $65 of the averagemonthly payment, and 25 percent ofthe remainder, up to the limits set bythe Secretary of Health, Education, andWelfare. Fifty percent of all State ad-ministrative costs would also be paid bythe Government.The effective date Is July 1, 1971, withspecial provisions for States with stat-utes which prevent them from comply-ing by that date.The cost of the bill to the FederalGovernment in Its first year of operationIs approximately $4.4 billion above thecosts required by the present welfareprograms. The total Federal outlay infiscal. 1972, the first year of the newprogram, is estimated to be approxi-mately $12.2 billion with the States ex-pending another $5.5 billion. The costof the bill Is about the same as that pro-posed by President Nixon. The majorchange Is that the reported bill treatsthe States differently, and in so doingwill reduce the overall State expendi-tures by some $567,600,000. This resultsfrom a change In State matching sup-plemental payments which help Stateswith higher benefit levels, nd the In-creased minimum Income standardswhich require States with low supportlevels to Increase their fiscal effort.Mr. Speaker,the gentleman fromTexas(Mr.BuatEsoN),introducedHR. 16600 on March 23 as a substitute.The Rules Committee did not make thatbill In order as a substitute, so the pro-visions of that bill will not be before theHouse. It contains much of the languageof the present bill, with the exception ofcertain guaranteed income payments.It seems to me the Idea that Is pre-sented in HR. 16311 has been aroundhere for a number of years. It has beendusted off a little bit and some frostingput on It. It has been Introduced as awelfare program. If it had been intro-duced by the last administration In theform It Is in, many Republican Memberswould have opposed it very bitterly.Almost everyone agrees that we needsome welfare reform, that the presentsystem Is not working. But is this wel-fare reform?. I believe It was introducedoriginally as welfare reform, but I do notthink it turned out to be a welfare reformprogram. In my opinion, It is more ofa welfare expansion program.It has been estimated that the billwould add approximately 15 millIon peo-ple to the welfare rolls of the UnitedStates. The California State Departmentof Social Welfare has not been able toestimate the cost to the State of the wel-fare program.Now, some of the problems: I refer youto pages 21 and 22 of the bill, whera theconditions are set forth and the extep-tlons are set forth and I particularlyrefer to the question of what Is suitableemployment. The person has to take suit-able employment. What Is suitable em-ployment? Who Is going to determinewhat suitable employment Is?Suppose an Individual Is trained andhe Is told to take a job 1 mile away. There April 15, 1970isno transportation, public or private. Hemust travel 1 mIle -eachway.He says:I can'twalkthat far. I can only walktwo miles a day, one mile to work and onemileback.Would that be suitable employment?And after training, would he then goback on the well are program? I do notknow, and there is no language in thebill that will help definitely to deter-mine that question.Suppose a person does not like theJob to which he Is sent. In some plantsemployeescannotsmoke.Inplants manufacturing aircraft they haive 15-minute breaks twice a day so that em-ployees can go outside to certain areaswhere they can smoke. Suppose an In-dividual does not like the job. He staysout 22 minutes. His foreman or super-visor says, \"Where have you been?\" Hesays, \"I took a little extra time.\"Suppose he does not like the work andthrows a monkey wrench in the ma-chinery and breaks it.How long are the employers going tohave to keep these people there If theydo not like the job and think It Is notsuitable? It seems to me that we musthave more definite, more specific lan-guage as to what suitable employment Isgoing to be and who is going to enforceIt and what we do if the Individual whois trained will not take the employment.We have to have more specific ianggein this bill to tell us what we will do Ifthis employment Is not considered suit-able.Take domestics. In my area we .cannotget domestic workers. I have some fami-lies where the father and mother bothare working, one where they have threechildren, one of whom Is semi-handi-capped. They cannot get anybody to takethe job. The State employment agencydoes not have anybody. No private em-ployment agencies have. We have triedto get a woman in from Mexico who waswilling to come up here. They cannot getcertification from the Labor Depart-ment. They always place an \"x\" In thebox that says there are plenty of avail-able people. People apparently do notwant to be domestic workers.Are we going to train them for that?Will that be considered suitable employ-ment, if they do not want that employ-ment?Take the engineers. Some have losttheir jobs because of the shortage ofcontracts. They want jobs but there arenot any. What do we do about those peo-ple? It seems to me we have to havesome jobs available for these engineerswho are out of work now.I have talked to brokerage firms InNew York, I talked to the'heads of twoof them yesterday. They told me. thatat the present time they are just barelyable to keep their heads above water.They said, \"ALLmI, why don't you solve acrisis in Washington?\" I said, \"Whatcrisis do you have In mind?\" They said,\"Well, solve Vietnam or something, be.cause we cannot keep going as we are.\"I think the administration Is trying tosolve Vietnam, but It Is not as easy asthat.I have two plants In my area, two cor-porations which a year or 2 ago sentCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014HOUSEin proposals saying that they were will-ing to train 200 people. This is not on-the-job training. They will have facili-ties, counselors, and teachers and all thatis necessary to determine what work thepeople can do. They guaranteed theywould train 200 people per year andguaranteed them jobs if the Governmentwould simply pay half the cost of theexpenses. I could not get a nickle down-town in the last administration or Inthis one. Yet the two corporations wereperfectly willing to spend their ownmoney to do that.I think we have some problems fromthat standpoint, and I thought those twofine companies would have interestingpilot programs. They were interested indoing it.I was talking to some executives thelast time I was home, in a plant which isa subsidiary in my district, and they saidthey are scared to death because thereare so many Imports coming In they donot know how they can keep going unlessconditions get better.Now, What about the professionalpoor? There are a million or a millionand a half of them. We will not let themstarve. We do not believe in that. So Ifthey will not work and they take theprogram and they register once, whatare we then going to do about that?I only mention these things because Itseems to me the bill ought to be moreclear. The proponents claim this willcreate Incentives to work and keep fami-lies together. I certainly hope so, but Idoubt It very much. None of us has acrystal ball. We cannot look into thefuture. They say, \"Lat us try the pro-grain.\" But wemust keep in mind thatwe have other programs which arespending money In education, In cleanair, water pollution, environmental con-trol, veteran problems, Vietnam, and onand on. This program Is going to costmore and-more money.Will we have to increase the debt be-fore June 30? Will we have to have anextension of the surtax? People feel nowthat they are being taxed to death. If wekeep on, they are liable to say, \"Throwall the rascals out in Washington andreplace the whole Congress.\"This starts a Federal means test forthe first time. I do not know whetherthat isgoodor bad. The facts will beplaced into a computer, The answercomes out that the father does not makeenough money to support his children.Do we then tell the children that yourfather Is not capable of supporting them?Is that for tlt good of the children?It starts a guaranteed income program,I am all for a guaranteed work program,but I am opposed to a guaranteed incomeprogram. There will be statements madeby Member after Member that we nowhave a guaranteed annual income whichwas written into the law some years ago.From a practical standpoint, that may betrue with the State programs and thesocial welfare, and so forth, and maybethere is a certain amount that certainfamilies actually will receive.But this Is the first time to my knowl-edge that we will actually write Into theFederal law that we will guarantee afamily a certain amount of money perH 3073year depending upon that family. I be-lieve the US. Treasury Is liable to beopened wide for the first time In our his-tory to pay people a certain amount ofmoney.I believe that this bill needs morestudy. I am all for Improving the pro-gram, as everybody Is, but I would hopethat the committee would give considera-tion to further studying this program, tofiguring out what suitable work Is andwho Is going to decide It, what it Is goingto cost, and then come In here, and per-haps have a little better legislation thanwe will have under a strictly closed rule,if this bill reaches that point.So far as I am concerned, I Intendto vote against the bill In Its presentform.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the remainderof my time.Mr. SISK. Mr. Speaker, I yield suchtime as he may consume to the gentle-man from Illinois (Mr. RosrENKowsKI),(Mr. ROSTENKoWsa asked and wasgiven permission to revise and extend hisremarks.)Mr. ROSTENKOWSKI, Mr. Speaker,on March 11, I joined with my colleagueson the Committee on Ways and Meansin reporting HR. 16311. This bill sym-bolizes a great step forward in provid-ing a basic level of financial assistancethroughout the Nation to needy familieswith children. In addition, the bill Isintended to convert the existing publicassistance program from one which re-sults In people remaining in dependencyto one which will encourage people tobecome Independent and self-support-ing through incentives to take trainingand enter employment.SInce 1960, the number of recipientsreceiving aid under AFDC programs hasIncreased from 2.4 million to about 6.7million. Moreover, the proportion ofchildren receiving assistance has beenrapidly increasing\u2014from 30 children per1,000 in 1955 to about 60 children per1,000 in 1970. In addition the costs ofthese programs have more than tripledduring the last 10 years\u2014to about $4billionat present. Estimates made bythe Department of Health, Education,and Welfare indicate these costs couldmore than double again during the next5 years unless action Is taken now todeal with the underlying causes of thiscrushing increase In both costs and num-bers of recipients.It Is clear that the type of welfare leg-islation that has been enacted In recentyears has not been very effective in deal-ing with the massive problems that areplaguing the welfare programs. It Isequally clear that a new direction mustbe taken to handle these problems.As reported by the Committee on Waysand Means, HR. 16311 represents justsuch a new direction for family assist-ance. It Is designed, to carry out the com-mittee's intent to reduce dependence onassistance and restore more families toemployment and self-reliance. It Is myfirm belief that this will gradually re-verse the present trend of spiraling costand Increasing dependence upon welfare.Basically, the family assistance planprovides that each family with childrenunder 18\u2014or under 21 Ifattending H 3074school\u2014whose nonexcludable Income Isless than $500 per year for each of thefirsttwofamily members and $300 peryear for each additional family member,and whose resources\u2014other than thoseexcluded\u2014the home, household goods,personal effects, and so forth, are lessthan $1,500 would be eligible to receivea family assistance benefit.Unlike present law, the family assist-ance plan contained In the bill includesneedy families where the father is inthe home and fully employed. The billprovides a uniform earnings exemptionwhich is equally applicable to familieswith male and female heads and well asthose who are fully and partially em-ployed.For purposes of Federal benefits underthe family assistance plan, the first $60a month In earnings would be disre-garded plus one-half of the remainder.A family of four would therefore be ableto receive some benefits under the pro-gram until Its Income reaches $3,920.Under the program, a family withoutother Income will receive $500 per yearfor each of the first two family members,plus $300 per year for each additionalfamily member. These payment rates es-tablish a Federal income maintenancefloor which in most States will be In-creased by required State supplementa-tion for all families except the workingpoor. The bill provides that each State'that was making AFDC payments higherthan the new family assistance benefit,would be required to maintain the levelsof payments In effect as of January 1,1970, or, If it Is lower, a level correspond-ing to the poverty level as defined in thebill.In order to assist the States In mak-ing supplementary payments, H.R. 16311provides that the Federal Governmentgenerally would pay a State 30 percent ofthe amount expended by the State Inmaking such payments each fiscal year,not including any supplementary pay-ments made to the working poor. How-ever, there would be no Federal paymentfor that part of the supplementary pay-ment which exceeds the difference be-tween the applicable poverty level andthe sum of the family assistance pay-ment and any income of the family notdisregarded In computing the supple-mentary peyments.H.R. 16311 also provides much neededassistance to the States In meeting thecosts of their public assistance pro-grams. Under present law, In flllnols thecoats of family programs of assistancewere $158.1 million in 1968. The FederalGovernment bore $78.9 million of thiscost, and the State paid $79.2 million.Under HR. 16311, for 1968, these totalcosts would $173.6 million. TheFederal Government's share would havebeen $127.4 State's share,$46.2 million. Thus, HR. 10311 wouldprovide a total increase In assistance tofamilies In Illinois of $15.5 million whiledecreasing the costs of the program tothe State bY $33 million.I am also Dleased that the Committeeon Ways and Means Included In HR.16311 signIficant Improvements In theprograms which assist the aged, blind,and disabled. The bill provides for corn-bining the present categories for assist-ance to these groups into one combinedadult assistance program and for uni-form requirements for all States for eli-gibility factors such as the level andtype of resources allowed and degree ofdisability or blindness.More Importantly, under HR. 16311,States must assure that each aged, blind,or disabled adult will receive assistancesufficient to bring his total income up to$110 a month. In addition, incentives areprovided for the States to enter Intoagreements for Federal administrationof the combined program and a simpli-fied Federal matching formula which willresult in generdily more favorable Fed-eral participation In the cost of the pay-ments. For Instance, in my home Stateof Illinois, the difference between exist-ing law and HR. 16311 for the year 1968would result In a savings of $6.7 millionfor Illinois and an Increase in expendi-tures by the Federal Government of $11.5million. The Increase In payments of as-sistance under the adult categories inIllinois would be $4.8 million.In summary, Mr. Chairman, I wouldlike to state my strong support of, thisbill and urge the House to take promptaction on its approval. Overall, the billwill provide equitable treatment of work-ing poor families; reduction In financialIncentives for family breakup; reductionof variations in payment levels amongthe States through the introduction of aFederal floor for family assistance pay-ments; establishment of a strength\u20acnedmanpower training program; and tin-provements In the level of help and ef-fectiveness of the adult assistance pro-grams.Mr. 815K. Mr. Speaker, I yield 10 mIn-utes to the distinguished gentleman fromGeorgia (Mr. LANDRUM).Mr.LANDR.UM. Mr. Speaker, I findmyself today In a most awkward position,yet awkward as It Is I am not uncom-fortable.It Is awkword for meto find myself Inopposition to the distinguished chairmanof my committee, and one of the mostdistinguished men of the Congress.It Is likewise awkward to find myselfopposingthedistinguishedminoritymember of the Committee on Ways andMeans, the gentleman from Wisconsin(Mr. Bms).But, as I said, It Is not uncomfortable.1! such an Incongruity as that statesnentImplies appears to be 1mpoble of as-ceptance, then allow me to ask the Mem-bers to study carefully during the next 6hours of debate and discussion on thisfloor the Incongruities In this piece oflegislation, and what I just said will seemas compatible as a newly married couple.In reflecting upon the provisions ofthis legislation and what I see In it forthe future of this country, if the leglsla-tion becomes law, there comes to my mindthe opening lines of Charles Dickens'\"Tale of Two Cities.\" I hope the Mem-bers will indulge me If I recall thoseopening lines.It was the beat of times, it was the worstof tgmes, it was the age of wisdom, it was theage of foolishness. it was the epoch of beSet,it was the epoch of incredulity. it was theasason of light, it was the season of darkness,Apr12 15, 1970itwas the spring of hope, It was the winterof despair, we had everything before us, wehad nothing before us, we were all going di-rect to heaven, we were all gotng direct theother way\u2014tn ehort., the period was so farLike the present period, that some of itsnoisiest authorities tnsleted on Is being re-ceived, 'for good or for evil, in the superlativedegree of comparison only.Now, in this bill we have some of thevery best things. No Memberof thisHouse, and certainly no member of theCommittee on Ways and Means whoheard the testimony, can disagree withthe fact that we need reform in all ofour welfare programs and in our welfarelegislation. But, In its entirety the bill Isnot reallyreform butrevolutionarychange that ought to be subjected toamendments which this rule precludes.And, when you study carefully the in-novations in this bill to bring about thatreform, I think we must, of necessity,come to the conClusion that some of theworst things ever proposed to this Con-gress are contaIned in It, and one ofthem Is a guaranteed annual income.Make no mistake about It, ladles andgentlemen\u2014make no mistake about it\u2014you vote this eg1slatton Into law andyou go down the road of no return, be-cause you have guaranteed an Incomeout of public funds to people employedand to people unemployed. To me that Isnot the age of wisdom; that Is theage of foolishness; that is the age of reckless-ness.Tb think that I must confront auch aproposition with my responsibility as aMember of this body and report to myconstituents that I am foreclosed fromoffering an amendment In the House ofRepresentatives to givethis bQdy achancet.ovoteonlt,Ihavetosay, asDickens said, \"This Is the age of de-spair.\" That is because I cannot offeran amendment here under this rule totake out this objectionable feature ofthe guaranteed Income. I have to swsi-low It if I want to vote for the Im-provements that are In this bill for aid todependent children, for the aged, for theblind, and for the unfortunate of thiscountry. So I despair to have to comehere today and admit to myself that weare foreClosed by the leadership of thisHouse and the leadership of this com-mittee by the demand for a closed rule.Incidentally, I was not a part of thatrequest for a closed rule. I voiced myobjections to It, as the chairman will re-call, when the request was made In thecommittee.The leadership of this House says,bring this on under a closed rule. Now,what Is wrong with any RepresentativeIn this House facing up to an amendmentthat affects the course of welfare legls-lation of this country and changes thefundamental structure of our Nationmore than any other single piece of leg-islation In the 18 years that I have beena Member of Congress?What does a guaranteed Income prom-ise? Let us take two worklngmen, twowage earners, working side by side, withequal skills, drawing the same Identicalwoge. We will just. use $2 an hour as anexample. One, being rather prolific him-self and perhaps having a prolific mate,has a large family, let us say five or six.CONGRESSIONAL RECORI) \u2014 HOUSE April 15, 1970Andthe other, not being so inclined orso constructed, has probably one or two.Yet, the one with the large family willdraw from the Federal Government, justlike the employees of the Federal Gov-ernment, a check every month to sup-plement his income to bring him up tothe level of income the Government saysa family of his size should have. And,mind you, it will come from the wagesof the man working alongside him sim-ply because the man working alongsidehim chose to have a family of smallerproportions and does not receive fromhis Government a subsidy payment. Buthe pays his tax.You cannot deny that, gentlemen. Theleadership of this House cannot deny it,if they have studied this bill. My distin-guished friends in the Committee ofWays and Means with their great capac-ity as legislators and as statesmen can-not deny It because they know It Is here.Moreover, Mr. Speaker, I cannot offeran amendment designed to stop provi-sions in the bill which will add literallyhundreds of thousands of employees tothe employment rolls of the Departmentof Health, Education, and Welfare. Why?Mr. Speaker, we now have about 2million people on the welfare rolls as Iunderstand It\u2014perhaps, a little less\u2014butwe are with this bill about to add 15million as a minimum estimate, but asa maximum estimate in my judgmentbetween 25 mIllion and 30 mIllion. And toadminister the law for all these new wel-fare recipientsliterally thousands ofnew employees will be required. We aregoing to be saying in law as the distin-guished gentleman from California saidawhile ago, \"Listen, fellow, your daddyis working; your daddy has got five chil-dren; you have got four brothers and sis-ters; your daddy has got a wife and thereare severi In your family.\" In other words,he Is working and he Is making $6,120.To my way of thinking that fellow has apretty substantial pride In his familyrelationship and In his accomplishments.He Is not going to be able to furnish eachone of those children two pairs of shoesall the time, the best cuts of meat allthe time, two suits and he Is not goingto ride in Cadillacs, even though it mightbe a \"welfare Cadillac,\" But his childrenhave pride In the fact that their fatheris making them a living. Yet, we arecoming in here on page 28 of this bill andsaying to that man because he makes lessthan $6,120 and has that many children,he is In poverty. And, we are saying tothose children, \"Your daddy is in poverty.Your Government is going to keep youup.\"Mr. Speaker, by doing this we will de-stroy the motivation of that child, wewill destroy the incentive of that man toimprove his skill. Further, we are pro-posing a statute, that does somethii'ig wehave never done before by telling aworkingman\u2014not a loafing man\u2014tellinga man working that because you makeless than so much you are in poverty andthe Government is going to take publicmoney and pay you a subsidy.That will require great sums of money.New revenue must be found. Surtaxes willbe added and increased\u2014not reduced oreliminated as now planned. Budget de-ficits will grow\u2014not decline and all be-CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014HOUSEcause we take the tragic step proposedin this bill of guaranteeing to a man\u2014whether or not he works\u2014annual incomeequal to a figure the Government decideshe should have.The SPEAKER. The time of the gen-tleman from Georgia has expired.Mr. SISK. Mr. Speaker, I yield thegentleman 1 additional minute.Mr. LANDRtJM. Mr. Speakers this bill puts the benefits in this order: Cash,food, and work. So long as we keep thepriorities In that order, gentlemen, weare going to be faced with the welfarerecipient saying, \"No; I am not going towork because I have already got thatcash and I have also got my food.\"Now, if you turn it around the otherway and put work first and cash last,then we will get along the road thatseems to me more American.Mr. Speaker, I am perfectly willing totax every man and woman In this coun-try for what is necessary to take care ofthe aged and to take care of the unfortu-nates and to take care of those who can-not take care of themselves. But I amunwilling to levy a single copper of taxin America to take care of any personwho simply will not work. And, that Isexactly what you are doing with thisbill.Mr. Speaker, if I had the opportunityto amend it, I would take that out andvote for the other, but not having thatchance to, I must say to my distinguishedchairman and my distinguished friendfrom Wisconsin and my friends in theHouse, despite my concern for the train-Ing programs that are provided for inthis bill, as well as other fine programs,I will have to oppose this bill because Inmy view we are going down the road ofno return.Mr. SMITH of California. Mr. Speaker,I yield briefly to the gentleman fromIndiana (Mr. LANDGREBE).(Mr. LANDGREBE asked and wasgiven permission to revise and extend hisremarks.)Mr. LANDGREBE. Mr. Speaker, therehas been no discussion at all on how theSupreme Court's March 23 ruling onwelfare is going to affect this program.Briefly stated, the High Court ruledthat it is unconstitutional for States andcities to stop welfare payments untilthey give recipients a chance to defendtheir rights to the benefits.The Court ruled that a welfare recipi-ent is entitled to a hearing before hispayments are cut off and the hearingmust include these four features:First. The needy person must be heardIn person. A written statement on hisbehalf is no longer good enough.Second. The recipient must be allowedthe opportunity to confront and to ques-tion any witnesses who say that he isineligible.Third. If the recipient wishes, he mayhave a lawyer at the hearing but thisis not required,Fourth. The official deciding eligibilitymust write out the reasons why he madehis decision and cite evidence he reliedupon.Now, what does this ruling have to dowith FAP The answer Is: No one Is sure.We do know that under the familyassistance program, a person receivingH 3075Payments' has his allotment scaled downas he makes more money. As for theso-called working poor, the same is truewith a definite cutoff point at a certainlevel beyond which no more FAP moneyis given the recipient. What the SupremeCourt ruling has at least made a possi-bility is that FAP recipients can now demand a full evidentiary hearing If theGovernment eithe cuts off or scalesdown their welfare payment.Chief Justice Warren Burger alludedto this possibility in his dissent in thecase when he said:Aside from the administrative morass whichtoday's decision could well create, the Courtshould also be cognizant of the legal prece-dent It may be setting. The majority holdingraises intriguing possibilities doncerning theright to a hearing at other stages in thewelfare process which effect the total sum ofassistance, even though the action takenmight fall short of complete termination. Forexample, doss the Court's holding embracewel.fare reductions or the denial of increasesas opposed to terminations, or decision con-cerning initial applications or requests ofspecial assistance. The Court supplies to dis-tinguishable considerations and leaves thesecrucial questions unanswered.In a footnote to his dissent, Chief Jus-ticeBurger noted that Los AngelesCounty alone employs 12,500 welfareworkers to process grants, to 500,000 people under various welfare programs.He said:The record does not reveal how many moreemployees will be required to give this newlydiscovered \"due process\" to every welfarerecipient whose payments are terminated forfraud or other factors of ineligibility or thosewhose initial applications are denied.But the outlook is not good.Ohio State Welfare Director DenverWhite says the Court ruling is, quote,\"terrible.\"It Is going to cause a taxpayers revolt. Nowwe must have)nore scrutiny of anyone apply-ing for welfare. Last month, we closed 3,000cases. .. nowwe would have to have hear-ings on all of these. .. andthat's 36,000 casesa year.The New York Post the day after theCourt ruling, reported that because of ItNew York State welfare officials may facethe possibility of a huge administrativelogjam because up until now they havegiven welfare recipients only a chance toreply In writing to contest their paymenttermination.An additional danger of this Courtruling is that it will give welfare rightsmilitants such as George Wiley, head ofthe National Welfare Rights Organiza-tion, a powerful new legal tool to combatand harass Government efforts to en-force welfare work requirements.With FAP adding some 15 million ad-ditional individuals to the welfare rolls,the opportunity will now be greatly en-han\u00f4ed for militant welfare organizersto bog down the system by simply de-manding hearings on every welfare. er-inination, reduction, or denied applica-tion.And there should be no doubt as to theway these groups feel about welfare workrequirements. George Wiley was quotedrecently In the Philadelphia Inquirer assaying:We're going to fight against forcing peopleto work In order to get welfare. We're pro- H 3076 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014 HOUSE April 15,1970pared to beat it in the streets. We're pre-pared to refuse to take jobs that are given us.The goal of the welfare militants, Mr.Chairman, has always been to breakdown the present welfare system andsubstitute in its place a guaranteed an-nual income. As long ago as June of 1966,Joseph Loftus reported in the New YorkTimes:Activists who are impatient with the John-son antipoverty campaign are firing up acampaign of their own. The objective, simplystated, is a uaranteed, Federerally financedannual income. The strategy of the activistsis to demand welfare payments for all whoqualify ... to... doublethe welfare rolls,and Impel the politicians to accept a guar-anteed income as a solution.In short, the latest Supreme Court rul-ing on welfare coupled with the familyassistance program, could open a Pan-dpra's box of hundreds of thousands offrivolously requested welfare hearingswhich, in turn, could lead to a completeand total breakdown of the present wel-fare system.Mr. SMITH of California. Mr. Speaker,I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman fromIllinois (Mr. AlmsssoN).(Mr. ANDERSON of Illinois asked andwas given permission to revise and ex-tend his remarks.)Mr. ANDERSON ofIllinois.Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule thatwould make in order the Family Assist-ance Act of 1970.Most of the time thus far consumedunder the rule has been spent I thinkIn attacking the provisions of this legis-lation. I was not privileged to be a Mem-ber of this body back in 1935 when weadopted social security-legislation. I feelquite sure that many of the fears andtrepidations that assailed the Membersof Congress at that time about the wis-dom of embarking on so sweeping andfar-reaching and novel a program asthat, that many of those same doubtsexist in this Chamber today.Yet, I want to say that I think thisafternoon of that night when I listenedtO the President of the United States InAugust of 1968 when he unveiled his ideaof a new federalism, something thatwould refurbish and restore new strengthand vigor to the institutions of thiscountry.At that time he spoke of the keystonein that arch as the reform of the welfareprogram. And those of you who believeIn the federal system, if you want tonourish and reinvigorate the roots offederalism in this country, cannot Ignorethe problem that we face with respect tothe welfare system in our country today.I am not going to discuss the substan-tive details of that legislation. Let me-in this time pay tribute to the distin-guished chairman and the distinguishedranking minority member, the gentle-man from Wisconsin (Mr. BYRNES) whofor three days sat patiently before theCommitee onules and gave us ampleevidence of their complete expertise inthis area. And I would hope our time thisafternoon and toinorrow will not bewasted in 6 hours of debate in listeningto those gentlemen and the rationalethat they give you in support of thisprogram. But I would suggest that if wereally want to do something to reformthis program we have to take a close lookat this program, because really what Itisis synergistic\u2014I think that is theword\u2014in itseffect: That is, the sumtotal of this legislation, the impact thatit can have on this country, is muchgreater than simply the suth total of thevarious parts.That is precisely why the Committeeon Rules gave a closed rule; not merelybecause, of precedent, because there isample precedent to do that, not simplybecause of the complexity of the legisla-tion with which we deal, although it iscomplex, but because I think we ought totake the bit between our teeth and votethis bill up or down one way or another.If we accept the premise tht I do, thatit can lead to real reform in this country,to the basic Institutions In our country,then we ought to be proud to cast ourvote for this legislation.With respect to what my distinguishedfriend and colleague, the gentleman fromGeorgia (Mr. LANDRUM) has said, \"Weare going to be levying a tax, we are goingto load the already overburdened tax-payer of this country still more, and taxhim for those who simply will not work.\"Well, If I can understand the very clearand concise English with which thechairman and the ranking minorityMember spoke, that is just not so; be-cause If a man wants to qus.llfy for thisprogram, under this legislation he Isgoing to be registered, he is going to bewilling to work, he is going to be willingt6 take training, and he is going to bewilling to do all of those things to qualifyfor a single penny, and I would submitwe are not taxing\u2014Mr. LANDRUM. Mr. Speaker, will thegentleman ylld?Mr. ANDERSON ofIllinois.Mr. Speaker, I will yield to the gentleman ifI have time.Let me suggest In the very few minutesremaining that I have that It would beutterly illusory this afternoon to assumethat our job is done when we pass thislegislation.I would again salute the members ofthe Committee on Ways and Means fortheir complete candor in discussing thislegislation with us when they said theycould not give us any guarantee that itis going to work perfectly. I would in-deed suppose that we will have to comeback many times with amendments tothis legislation perhaps In the light ofexperience and in the light of what weare able to do under this bill, and pro-vide more training slots, make It easierfor people to get the kind of trainingthat will qualify them for the job market.But it is a beginning. It is more thanjust a small beginning. It Is a very largestep in the direction that we want to go.I talked to the Illinois director of pub-lic aid the other day when he was inWashington, and he said that next. yrIn his State they are going to spend 6million just on public aid, an increase of$186 million In 1 year alone. And he saidmore than half of the 18 percent IncreaseIn the public assistance rolls of Illinois,more than half of the people who weregoing to be added to those rolls, are goingto be fathers who have deserted theirfamilies. And if there Is one thing\u2014The SPEAKER. The time of the gen-tleman has expired.Mr.ANDERSONofIllinois.Mr. Speaker, can the gentleman yield meadditional time?Mr. SMITH of California. Mr. SpeakerI yield 30 addItional seconds to the gen-tleman from Illinois.?'Ir.ANDERSONofIllinois.Mr. Speaker, if there is one thing that Im-presses me about this bill It is the factthat the basic thrust is to try to holdthat family together, to keep the fatherfrom deserting his wife and children, andto preserve the very basic unit of Ameri-can society.For that reason alone\u2014for that rea-son alone I think we will make history,and the right kind of history, If we adoptthis legislation today.I strongly feel that the administration'splan Is the only sound and viable alter-native to the colossal welfare mess whichnow exists. I do not think there Is any-one in this Chamber who would defendthe existing welfare system; there Is gen-eral agreement among people of all po-litical and Ideological persuasions thatIt has been an enormous failure and thatIt Is In drastic need of a complete over-haul.The merit of a welfare system can bedetermined by the extent to which Ithelps those who are unable to help them-selves and promotes eventual self-reli-ance and independence among those whoare able to help themselves. Existing wel-fare schemes have failed the reclflenton both counts: they have failed to ade-quately meet the needs of the perma-nently dependent and have Also failedto elevate the potentially Independent. Inthe decade of the sixties welfare costsdoubled and the welfare rolls have swol-len from 5.8 mIllion to 10 millIon people.If nothing is done to change the presentaid to dependent children program\u2014AFDC\u2014it is estimated that by 1975 Itstotal cost will soar from today's $4.3 bil-lion to $12 billion, and the poor will bejust as entrenched and dependent as everbefore, only In greater numbers. Thiscan hardly- be termed genuine and effec-tive welfare; It is institutionalized pov-erty.President Nixon described this monumental mess best In his August 11,1969, welfare message:The present welfare system has failed us\u2014it has fostered family breakup, has providedvery little help in many States and has evendeepened dependency by all-too-often mak-ing it more attractive to go on welfare thanto go to work.The bill before us today provides fora comprehensive rform of the welfaresystem and goes to the very heart of theglaripg deficiencies and failures of pres-ent programs. President Nixon has char-acterized the family assistance plan as,\"a new approach that will make It moreattractive to go to work than to go onwelfare, and will establish a nationwideminimum payment to dependent familieswith children.\" Again, to quote the Presi-dent:This would be total welfare reform\u2014thetransformation of a 8ystem frozen in failure April 15,1970andfrustration into a system that. wouldwork and would encourage people to work.Let me explain briefly how the familyassistance plan would work and how itwould encourage people to work. Thefamily assistance plan would replaceAFDC programs and would establish abasic Income for all parents who cannotadequately support their families. Forexample, the Federal payment to a fam-ily of four with no more than $720 an-nual Income would be $1,600. FAP pay-ments would be uniform throughout theNation and thus eliminate the gross dis-parities and 4nequlties which exist indifferent States under present programs.As a family's income Increases, it wouldcontinue to receive Federal Income sup-plements In reduced amounts until thefamily has climbed above the povertyline. For example, that same family offour with an annual income of $2,000would receive a supplementary paymentof $960.Another provision In having 1970\u2014which family assistance leveisT tosupplement the family assistance levelup to that level or the poverty level,whichever Is lower, In order to continueeligibility under medicaid and other wel-fare programs. Federal matching fundsfor the State supplement would be avail-able at a rate of 30 percent, except for theworking poor. The State would not berequired to supplement payments to theworking poor.For example, in my own State of Il-linois, current AFDC payments to a f am-ily of four\u2014-one parent and three chil-dren\u2014are $3,228. Under the FAP for-mula, a family of four with $2,000 an-nual income would receive a $960 Fed-eral supplement and a $1,415 State sup-plement provided that the family is clas-sified as nonworking poor, that Is, afamily In which no member worked over30 hours a week. The total supplementedincome of that family would be $4,375per year.So, to those who claim that the $1,600Federal floor Is too low a minimum bene-fit, I would like to point out that welfarerecipients In 42 of our 50 States will alsobe receiving these State supplementarypayments; and, in addition, families willalso be eligible for Federal food stamps.So, our family of four having no incomewould not only receive a $1,600 annualFederal payment, and in most cases aState supplement, but $864 per year Infood stamps as well.Now let me move on to what I considerto be the real heart of this welfare re-form proposal, the work requirementsand the work Incentives. As I pointed outpreviously, under the present welfaresystem, there Is little or no incentive fora welfare family to become a workfarefamily. In my own State of fllinols a sur-vey has demonstrated that while a largepercentage of the mothers on welfarewould like to work and would much pie-far to work, they are disinclined to do sobecause they are getting a much betterdeal financially on welfare than theywould In taking a job and thereby for-f$tlng welfare beneflt.&CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEThe family assistance plan contains arequirement to register for work andstrong Incentives to accept training andemployment. If a person falls to registerfor work, he will not receive the benefits;and If he refuses a suitable lob or train-ing, his benefits will be canceled. Onlycarefully defined groups would be ex-empted from the registration require-inent. I know that some critics of FAPclaim that the work incentive approachwill not work and they cite the WIN pro-gram as an example. I think it Is Im-portant at this point to say why certainWIN programs were less than successful,and to show how the FAP approach willavoid these pitfalls. Under the WIN pro-gram, a great deal of discretionary powerwas put in the hands of State socialworkers to define who was appropriatefor referral to manpower training pro-grams and employment. In the words ofJerome M. Rosow, the Assistant Secre-tary of Labor for policy:Many state welfare agencies circumventedthe intent of the law by refusing to referclients to the manpower program, or re-ferred such small numbers as to seriouslyhamper training efforts to reduce the we1-fare rolls.Because of the wide latitude In discre-tionary powersleftto State welfareagencies, we find great disparities inthe percentage of AFDC adults deemedappropriate for referral from State toState. In our two largest States, for ex-ample, New York and California, thispoInt is borne out. In New York, wherethere were 703,000 potentially eligiblepeopleon AFDC,only6.9percent were deemed appropriate for referral. InCalifornia, on the other hand, wherethere were 200,000 potentially eligiblepeople on AFDC, 35.8percent weredeemed appropriate for referral. Andlooking at one of our smaller States, Ne-braska, where there were 52 potentIallyeligible people on AFDC, 100 percent weredeemed appropriate for referral to man-power training.The familyassistanceplanwould strengthen the work requirement nowineffectunder WIN by completelyeliminatingthesewidediscretionarypowers of referral. Instead, a new Fed-eral agency would determine who Is toregister, and the guidelines on exemp-tion would beexplicitratherthan discretionary and would be strictly en-forced. Once a person has registered. withthe Employment Service, an individualemployability plan would be workedout specifying what steps are necessaryto insure permanent attachment to thelabor force. And a team of specialistswould be responsible for the follow-throughonthatplan.Jobplace- ment would be followed by the nec-essary coaching designed to prevent ahigh rate of job dropouts. -AsI mentioned earlier, the family as-sistance plan couples work requirementswith work Incentives. The strongest work,Incentives, of course, are the naturalmarket benefits which accrue to a wageearner. But there are other incentivesbuilt into the plan. Thee Include thefollowing:First, there would be no reduction inbenefits for the first $720 in earnings.113077Thisisdoublethe present earningdisregards.Second,Stateswouldberequired under Federal law to disregard earningsin computing benefits. The present sys-tem operating in 23 States for unem-ployed fathers still taxes 100 percent ofIncome. Under FAP the incentive towork would not be choked offby this procedure since fathers would re-ceive the same treatment on reten-tion of earnings as mothers now on wel-fare.Third, two new factors would increasethe incentive to enter training programs.First, the amount of extra training bonushas been raised; and secondly, the man-power agency would reimburse traineesfor the cost of attending training pro-grams, such as transportation, clothes,and supplies.Fourth, the family assistance planprovides for child care which will maketraining and employment possible for alarge number of mothers. An additional450,000 child care opportunities would beavailable in the first year.And finally, the family assistance planprovides for additional training slots forweLl are recipients\u2014an additional 250,-000 slots in the first year.Let me turn now to a controversialfeature of the family assistance plan, theinclusion of the working poor. I realizethat there are some who object to thison the grounds that we would be addinganother 10 million people to the welfarerolls. And yet, it is my firm convictionthat the Inclusion of the working pooris the real key to the success of PAP.Let me quote from a question answersheet issued jointly by the Departmentsof Labor and Health, Education, andWelfare:By providing help for the first time tofathers who work full time but for povertywages, we reverse the present policy of penalizing work and rewarding non-work.No longer will a man have to quit his jobor leave his family in order for his familyto receive assistance. Rather, we offer a boostto the man who is already trying to climbtoward ultimateIndependence andself-rellauce.Mr. Speaker, earlier I pointed out thatone of the two criteria of an effectiveand successful welfare program is theextent to which we help those who areable to help themselves climb out of pov-erty. By assisting the working poor wewould be rewarding rather than penaliz-ing work and providing a ladder to en-able the working poor to climb out ofpoverty.I totally reject the argument that in-cluding the working poor under familyassistance will create a new and perma-nent breed of welfare recipient. To quoteagaIn from Jerome M. Rosow:One fact to bear in nlinci about the work-ing poor is that they are not likely to be-come long-term recipients of assistance pay-ments. Because of rising wage scales due toincreased productivity, about 200,000 of thevork1ng poor rise above the poverty lineevery year. Upgrading efforts on the part ofthe manpower agency will increasethismovement to self-sufficiency.Finally, In \u00f4onnection with the work-fare approach, let me address myself to H 3078whatsome critics call the myth of em-ployability among the welfare popula-tion. These critics contend that very fewwelfare recipients are either capable orwilling to take employment. Allow me toexplode that myth by citing a recentstudy done by the Department of LaborIn collaboration with the Urban Insti-tute. That study concludes that, of thoseadults who would be covered by the Fam-ily Assistance Plan, 3.2 million or 47percent of the adults covered could bemade employable. The study goes on topoint out that of the 1.4 million malefamily heads classified as employable,only an estlmited 30,000 have done nowork at all during a 12-month period.And even among the female familyheads, some 60 percent have work ex-perience during part of the year. In thewords of Jerome Rosow:The employment goals of the Family As-sistance Plan are neither unreasonable orunobtainable.To make these work goals a completesuccess, It is obvious that we must relyheavily on the private sector to play Itspart. There is already substantial evi-de\u00f1ce that the private sector is willingand able to play such a social role. TheJOBS program of the National Allianceof Businessmen is one such example ofthe way In which business and govern-ment can work together to satisfy man-power needs. We will soon be consideringtheadministration'sComprehensiveManpower Training Act which Is aimedat consolidating and Improving Federaltraining programs and eventually turn-ing them over to States and localities.I am proud to be a cosponsor of theComprehensive Headstart Child Devel-opment Act of 1970 which would furtherexpand child care opportunities whichare so important to the working mother.All these programs and services will cer-tainly complement what we' are trying toaccomplish under the family assistanceplan which Is a transition and transfor-mation from welfare to workiare.Mr. Speaker, I submit that if we donot come to grips with this problem nowby adopting this comprehensive reformof our welfare system, the next timearound we may be so helplessly andhopelessly bogged down In this welfaremire that we will be unable to take evenone step in the direction of reform, andwe will be guilty of assigning millions ofAmericans toa permanent stateofpoverty and dependency.Mr. SMITH of California. Mr. Speaker,I yield 4 mInutes to the gentleman fromOhio (Mr. LATTA).Mr.LATI'A. Mr. Speaker, let me saythat I am opposed to a closed rule on thisbill. I voted against a closed rule in theCommittee on Rules and there were sev-eral other members on our committeewho voted likewise, and for a modifiedopen rule. I favor a modified open rule.I think it Is pretty well known that thevery able chairman of our committeefavored a modified rule so that the gen-tleman from Georgia (Mr. LDRuM)might have had the opportunity to sub-mit his bill as a substitute. I do not thinkMembers of this House should be pre-cluded from amending such an Impor-tant piece of legislation. They wouldCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEhave no opportunity to do so under aclosed rule and would have only onevote\u2014for or against the bill as reportedby the Ways and Means Committee.By voting for a modified open rule, wewould not be opening up the completeSocial Scurlty Act, for amendment ashas been suggested.I happen to believe that Members ofthis House should have the same oppor-tunity to amend this bill as Members ofthe Senate will have when the matter Isconsidered on the Senate floor. They willnot be debating this bill under a closedrule and we should not be doing so in theHouse.Mr. Speaker, there is a way left whichwill give us an opportunity to amend iton the floor. Vote down the previousquestion and then the Issue will beopened up giving us an opportunity toamend this bill. I would urge that thisbe done.Let me say, we have heard a lot onour side of the aisle that this is an ad-ministrative bill. Let me say, I do nottake a back seat to anyone In my supportof the Presidentof the United States. Iam one of those who suported him longbefore Miami, and I will support himlong after this bill passes.Let me say, this guaranteed incomeidea was not conceived In this admin-Istration. It has been kicked around bythe ADA for many years. The only realdifference being that they want to startat a much higher figure.Back in 1966, if you please, a Presi-dentialcommissionunderPresidentJohnson recommended a $3,000 guaran-teed annual income. It got exactly no-where.So what do we have here today? Wehave a guaranteed annual income beingpresented to us under a different name\u2014the fauil' assistance plan. You are goingto have t register for work and for train-ing. This Is a joke when one reads thesection dealing with employment andthen looks at the past record on retrain-ing.It was pointed out before the Commit-tee on Rules, that It had only 81,000 Intraining or retraining last year\u2014a meredrop in the ocean of need, If you please.Let us not kid ourselves. Let us notkid the American people that Govern-ment is going to train or retrain the mil-lions of people who will come under thisprogram. Also, let us not kid ourselves orthe American people that you are goingto get these people all working under theterms ofthisbillbecause you haveseven\u2014mark this\u2014seven escape hatcheson page 21 and page 22.If you will turn with me to page 21,let me read them to you. They do nothave to go to work unless It is sultableemployment. Look for a minute at thismatter of suitability, on line 21 of page21:In determining whether any employmentis suitable for an individual for purposes ofsubsection (a) and part C, the Secretary ofLabor shall consider\u2014(1) The degree of risk to such individual'shealth and safety.(2) HIs physical fitness for the work.(3) Ifis prior training and experience.(4)HIsprior earnings.(5) The length of his unemployment.April 15,1970(6)His realistic prospects for obtainingwork based on his potential and the avail-ability of training opportunities.(7) The distance of the available workfrom his residence.If that Is not enough\u2014let us look atsubsection (2), If you please, which says:In no event shall any employment be con-sidered suitable for an individual\u2014\"(A) if the position offered is vacant duedirectly to a strike, lockout, or other labordispute;\"(B) if the wages, hours, or other terms orconditions of the work offered are contraryto or less than those prescribed by Federal,State, or local law or are substantially lessfavorable to the individual than those pre-vailing for similar work in the locality; or\"(C) if, as a condition of being employed,the individual would be required to join acompany union or to resign from or refrainfrom joining any bona fide labor organiza-tion.And I stress \"company unlon\"\u2014it saysnothing about joining an internationalunion. Why require a person to join aninternational union as a matter of law?What about our right-to-work States, ifyou please? What does this language doto those States? Why, if a man in abona fide way Is referred for work In aplant having an international union andsays, \"I haven't ever joined a union. Itis against my conscience,\" should he beprecludedfrombenefitsbysuchlanguage?The SPEAKER. The time of the gen-tleman from Ohio has expired.Mr. 818K. Mr. Speaker, I yield thegentleman 1 additional minute.Mr. LATrA. I appreciate my friendsyielding me this time.Let me say there are many provisionsin this bill which will require more than6 hours debate time to explain. We haveheard about the goodies in this bill forthe benefit of those not working. We havenot heard anything about the burdensthe taxpayers of this Nation\u2014the littlepeoplethe gentleman from Georgiatalked about\u2014are going to have to carryto pay the cost of such a program. Wehave not heard\u2014nor will we hear atpresent\u2014anythingaboutthetaxeswhich will have to be collected to supportthe 15 million additional people this billwill put on welfare.We have a lot of proud people, hard-working people, in the Fifth Congres-sional District of Ohio who will never\u2014never ask for a dime under this bill, butare earning less than $6,000 a year, withthe requisite number of children placingthem in the poverty classification underthis bill. Nevertheless, these individualswill have to dig deeper into their pock-ets to pay thisbill.In conclusion, let me say that as I lis-tened to the testimony before the RulesCommittee and heard all about the good-ies in this bill and what the Governmentought to do I could not help but be re-minded of a statement by the late Presi-dent John F. Kennedy:Ask not what your country can do for you,but what you can do for your country.I fear not only what this bill coulddo to the country but what it could do tothe incentive of a great many people tobetter their economic status In life ontheir own initiative and through theirown labors. April 15, 1970 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014HOUSE 113079Mr. SMITHofCalifornia. Mr. Speaker,I yIeld 11/2 minutes to (Mr. DENrns) the remain-der of my time.Mr. 818K. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gen-tleman 1 addItional minute.(Mr. DENNIS asked and was givenpermission to revise and extend his re-marks.)Mr. DENNIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank thegentleman for yielding.Mr. Speaker, I rise In opposition to therule. I do it reluctantly, but I do it be-cause I believe with the poet that \"to sitin silence when you should protest makescowards out of men,\" and this is suchan occasion. We are being asked here to-day, Mr. Speaker, to adopt one of themost far-reaching measures we haveever been asked to adopt in this House.It Is a measure which provides a directsubsidy out of the Federal Treasury forevery poor family in the Nation. It Is ameasure which extends Federal relieffor the first time to the working poor.Itis a measure which abolishes andabandons the philosophy of welfare as anemergency relief, and enshrines It as afundamental American right.It is a measure which starts welfarereform by doubling the welfare rolls, andit is a measure which, to a large extent,if not completely, adopts the principleof the guaranteed annual income.Now, I am not prepared to adopt ameasure as sweeping as this without alot more public consideration and debatethan It has yet had, and I am not pre-pared to do it without a fair opportunityto debate it and amend it in this body.We are being asked to adopt a measureof this sweeping and fundamental char-acter under a closed rule, with no possi-bility of being usefully heard or of chang-ing a single thing on the floor. In myshort time here I have conceived a greataffection for this body and its Membersand its procedures; but I tell you, we liketo say we are the greatest deliberativebody in the world, but when we come toconsider a measure of this kind withoutany meaningful deliberation and with-out any opportunity to engage In debatewhich will lead to any signifloant action,we do not deserve the name of a delibera-tive body. To treat us like this is to deni-grate the office of U.S. Representative.The procedure offends me.It makes a rubberstamp out of Repre-sentatives. What are we here for If wecannot usefully debate a measure of thismagnitude and consider It on its merits,but just have to take It as it is and voteit up or down?I submit to the Members, in all goodhumor, that to take up a measure of thischaracter and of this importance under aclosed rule is practically to treat theMembers of this honorable body as theidiot children of the whole political proc-ess. I do not think we ought to do it. Ithink we ought to debate this here withsome chance to take some action if wewant to.Maybe\u2014maybe If we did that, some-body could persuade me that this meas-ure was entitled to my support. Theycannot do it under this procedure. I In-tend to vote no. I hope Members will votedown the rule;Mr. SCHADEBERO. Mr. Speaker, I amtotally opposed to a closed rule on HR.16311, the Family Assistance Act of 1970.It is my firm opinion that any legisla-tion as far reaching as this bill Is, If passed or rejected, must reflect the willof the majority of the Members of theHouse and not merely the majority ofone of its constituted committees.Unless the House of Representatives isgiven the opportunity to clarify certainlanguage in the bill; unless we can beassured that there are no other alterna-tives to correcting the ovehwhelmlng in-consistencies and failures of the presentwelfare system than this massive pro-gram which would add 15 million Ameri-cans to the present welfare load; andunless we have the opportunity to makeconstructive amendments that could prevent this Nation from galloping downthe road to a guaranteed annual income,I cannot either in conscience, or in thebest interests of my hard working, taxpaying constituents, vote for the finalpassage of the legislation.Mr. Speaker, I was a cosponsor of theoriginal family assistance legislation. Ontwo separate occasions I requested theassistance of my entire constituency incorresponding with me on the matter ofwelfare reform. I received several hun-dred informative letters. I made specialefforts to meet with groups and organi-zations, both private and government, Inorder to give them the opportunity tomake recommendations which wouldstrengthen the bill and work out prob-lem areas In welfare programs.I corresponded and met with membersof the Wisconsin Legislature in order tofind out how various proposals would af-fect the State's programs and the State'sfinancial obligations. I have been look-ing forward to the, opportunity when I,as a Member of the House of Representa-tives, coul4 represent these views in opendebate on welfare reform legislation.The closed rule on the Family Assist-ance Act of 1970 will preclude me fromadequately representing the many peo-ple I have contacted, whose expressionshave been made on the assumption thatthey could be brought to the House tobe incorporated into Federal legislation.Instead of an open rule, under which I,and other Members of the House not onthe Ways and Means Committee, couldexpress the will of the people of the Na-tion, who will be required to pay for andcomply with welfare reform proposals,the closed rule Insures that the will ofa majority of a committee must eitherbe accepted or rejected.Mr. Speaker, I cannot see the wisdomor the justice In denying the entire mem-bership of the House of Representativestheprivilegeofimproving thisbill. When this legislation comes before theother body of Congress, its Members willbe permitted to work their will. This willleave us with only two alternatives whenthe conference report comes before usfor consideration: First, to accept theSenate version of a bill we in the Housewere not permitted .to Improve; andsecond, to vote against any possible im-provement of a welfare system we allknow is in need of correction.If the House accepts a closed rule, Iwill be forced to vote against the passageof the bill. My constituents, who haveexpressed overwhelming support for re-sponsible welfare reform, have in thepast received my assurances that I wouldwork for reform. I regret to say that theirresponsibility of a closed rule precludesme from doing just that. The entiremembership of the House of Representa-tives will have been denied the constitu-tional obligation of contributing our willand that of the people who have electedus to legislate In the most responsiblemanner possible.Mr. CLEVELAND. Mr. Speaker, I in-tend to vote against the rule under whichthe House will consider H.R. 18311. Myprinciple reason for this is because therule is a closed rule, and no amendmentswhatsoever can be offered from the floor.Those of us who are on record as op-posed to proposals for a guaranteed an-nual income will not be afforded any op-portunity to consider and debate amend-ments which would remove provisionswhich essentially enact guaranteed in-come provisions in this bifi.For a long time, Mr. Speaker, I haveconcerned myself with congressional re-form. It Is regrettable that this body,which we sometimes refer to as thegreatest deliberative body in the world,has been so reluctant to bring its proce-dures up to date. It seems to me thatthis Isagood example as to why ourprocedures are in serious need of reform.This legislative proposal has been her-alded as a welfare reform measure. Itseems incongrous that legislation thusheralded would be considered by theHouse under a closed rule which makesit Impossible to offer amendments, toconsider amendments, to debate amend-ments, or to vote on amendments. It istrue that welfare needs reform. It is evenmore true that the House needs reform.Mr. RANDALL. Mr. Speaker, I intendto oppose the adoption of the resolutionwhich would provide a closed rule with6 hours of debate to consider the FamilyAssistance Act of 1970,In nearly every instance I support therule which sets the time and terms ofdebate for bills to be considered on thefloor of the House. The reason is, I be-lieve every Member should have the op-portunity for open and adequate debate.However, it should be clearly recallednearly all of the rules or resolutionswhich are presented for our approvalor rejection by the Committee on Rulesare what we call open rules under whichthe opportunity exists to offer multipleamendments which In many instancesmake good legislation after amendmentout of poor or bad legislation as wefirst receive it on the floor of the House.A closed rule such as we are asked toaccept today denies Members an oppor-tunity to offer amendments. Even to referto such a rule as closed Is too respectfuland Is being overgenerous. Such a ruleshould be labeled according to its truedescription and referred to as a gag rule.Because that is exactly what It Is. Unfor-tunately, it seems that we Members ofthe House have visited against us thesekind of gag rules only at the request otthe Committee on Ways and Means.For some reasons the members of this CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEThe question was taken; and there204, Moorhead with Mr. Bell of California.Mr. Brown of California with Mrs. Hecklerof Massachusetts.Mr. AndersonofTennesseewithMr. Mize.Mr. Patman with Mr.'Rlegle.Mr. William D.

Now,I have great confidence In the Committeeon Ways and Means but I know of noreason that the other Members of thisbody must accept In total or reject Intotal the legislative judgment of the 25members that make up that committee.I know I speak like many Members ofthis House who regularly vote against aclosed rule as an expression that they donot intend to abdicate to the members ofthe Commitee on Ways nd Means ourresponsibility to legislate for the peopleof the congressional district which eachof us represent.Is It necessary to recall that shouldthe Family Assistance Act pass theHouse, which I sincerely hope does nothappen, and the bill goes to the otherbody of the Congress, Members of thatbody will have carte blanche to makeany changes to the amending processwhich the persuasion of the Memberoffering the aznndment can accom-plish.Who on our side of the Congress canfall to recall the monstrosities the otherbody have sent back to us as a result offloor amendments from the north sideof the Capitol on tax legislation on whichwe In the House were gagged, muzzled,and muted in the matter of amend-ments?Oh, I suppose there could be somesllght justification argued In behalf ofa closed rule In purely tax matters,particularly those which are intendedto raise revenue but that Is not the caseIn th1s Instance. Thisisa welfare billand has entirely to do with the expendi-ture of revenue. There Is no reason for aclosed rule. Those who support such agag rule in effect are voting to limit to8 percent of the total membership of thisHouse, which is the percentage of themembership on the Committee on Waysand Means bears to the total member-ship, the rights and responsibilities tolegislate on a matter that will affect Inone way or another all the people werepresent.Mr. SMITh of California.

Mr. Speaker, I move thatthe House resolve Itself into the Com-mittee of the Whole House on the Stateof the Union for the consideration ofthe bill (KR. 16311)to authorize afamily assistance plan providing basicbenefits to low-income families with chil-dren, to provide Incentives for employ-ment and training to Improve the capac-ity for employment of members of suchfamilies, to achieve greater uniformityof treatment of recipients under the Fed-eral-State public assistance programsand to otherwise Improve such programs,and for other purposes.The motion was agreed to.IN'rIlE COMMITTEE OFTHE WHOLEAccordingly the House resolved itselfinto the Committee of the Whole Houseon the State of the Union for the conld-eration of the bill HR. 16311, with Mr.DINGELL in the chair.The Clerk read the title of the bill.By unanimous consent, the first read-ing of the bill was dispensed with.The CHAIRMAN. Under the rule, thegentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Mfl.Ls)will be recognized for 3 hours, and thegentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Bwzs)will be recognized for 3-hours.The Chair recognizes the gentlemanfrom Arkansas.Mr. MILLS. Mr. Chairman, I yield my-self 20 mInutes.Mr. Chairman, H.R. 16311 is one of themost important bills this Congress willconsider.I recognize there is probably a greatdeal of feeling about the bill outside ofthe Congress.I also believe there Is a great deal ofmisunderstanding about the bill outsideof the Congress. One organization, forexample, took a position opposed to thebill 2 weeks before the committee re-ported it, not knowing, of course, whatamendments had been adopted in thecommittee or what the language was, andthen evidently expects Members to fol-low Its recommendations on that kindof a basis. It Is beyond me how they cando so.Mr. Chairman, let me talk first aboutour committee consideration of the mat-ter, the present situation, and what weare trying to do.The committee conducted 4 weeks ofhearings on social security legislation,principally in the area of welfare reform,last October and November. CommencIngm January 19, the day Congress recon-vened, the committee met regularly inexecutive session over a period of 7 ull weeks in drawing up this legislation, andIn studying the administration and theoperation of the programs providing cashassistance for the needy, and the exist-ing work-training and day-care pro-grams for -AFDC recipients. During itsdeliberations, committee had thebenefit of hearing from a number ofState and local officials engaged In run-ning our welfare and training programsand others who have studied particularareas of those programs. Through thisprocess, we gained many valuable In-sights into the problems that exist andwhat should be done to correct them.Mr. Chairman, this bill Is essentiallypatterned after the bill presented by theCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014HOUSEadministration but with some majorchanges, tightening, sharpening and Im-proving many of the specific provisions.The committee also added some provi-sions of Its own. Some of these changesare very Important, as I will delineatelater.At the present time we have categoriesof assistance known as the old age as-sistance program, the program for aidto families with dependent children andunemployed fathers, the disability pro-gram, and the program for the blind.The program of old-age assistance, theprogram for the disabled, and the pro-gram for the blind have not in recentyears presented any serious problems tothe Ways and Means Committee or tothe Congress, The number of people onthe old-age assistance program has de-clined. It could have been expected Itwould be reduced as more and more ofour people became eligible for social se-curity benefits.The program we added, allowing asocial security cash payment to thosewho had become disabled and who hada work record, has naturally reduced thenumber who would be eligible for andwant the welfare program known as thedisability program, or the program forthe blind.Also it is significant to note that In thecase of a widow whose husband has diedand left her with minor children, thenumbers who go on AFDC from thatcategory do not rise, because of the sur-vivorship benefits of the social\" securityprogram.The number of children in male-headed families has not risen over theyears,and has remainedessentially static for some 25 years, In fact.Mr. Chairman, the program that hasrisen most, however, of all of these pro-grams is that part of AFDC that hasto do with children in female-headedfamilies, where the father for some rea-son Is absent from the home or, as amatter of fact, where there has neverbeen a marriage with respect to thathome.Now let me talk to you a little bitabout the runaway growth In case loads,and costs under AFDC. In 1935 the orig-inal act was passed. By 1950 there wasa total cost in the program of some $500million. In 1969, for the fiscal year, whichIs the last year I have figures on, thenumber of families\u2014and this Is fami-lies\u2014who were on AFDC has risen to 1.7million and the total cost of providing forthis program was approximately $45billion. The cost of that program hasdoubled in 3 years. Think of that. If youproject down the road this present coston the basis of the way it has been risingin recent years, by the year 1975 it willbe well over $8 billion, and some peoplewithin the Department think it could beas much as $12 billion.The proportion of children in thiscountrydependentonwelfarehas doubled over the last 15 years. Today, sixchildren in every 100 are on AFDC, andthe rate Is still increasing, In some Statesthe rate is almost double the nationalrate.Now, that is the existing program wehave. The level of spending is not deter-H 3081mined by the Federal Oovernment; It Isdetermined by the State governments.Under existing law, we match the Stateof New York or any other State not lessthan 50 percent of the cost of this pro-gram regardless of where they fix thelevel. If you want an example of anopen-ended proposition where we arecompletely helpless to put any restraints,controls, or limitations on It or makeany improvements to it, it is in this pres-ent program.Mr. Chairman, this program worriesme greatly insofar as the cost is con-cerned, but there Is another matter ofconcern tome. The AFDP program en-courages family breakup. Do not thinkfor 1 mInute that It has not made acontribution to many, many fathers leav-ing their faz\u00f1lljes In order that the fam-ily could eat and have clothing to wear.Yes. Take my word for It. The presentAFDC program puts a premium and anIncentive on the breakup of a home.Yet, the Federal Oovernment and thetaxpayers in your State are paying theamounts provided under these variousState formulas whether they pay thesame amount in that particular State ornot. There is one State that pays In therange from zero. to $49 a month for afamily of four under APDC.Mr. Chairman, there are two Statesthat pay as much as $250 to $299. Someof these States actually pay a family offour on AFDC, which is not, of course,subject to any tax, more money thin aman working at a job can make at theminimum wage, working practically fulltime, all year long.Not only Is there this incentive tobreak up the family, this Incentive inmany States now for the person who Isworking to quit his job and go onAFDC\u2014and do not think for a minutethat does not happen. The Director of theprogram in the city of New York saidthat women quit Jobs at departmentstores as salesladies and went immedi-ately on welfare because they had minorchildren and could receive more thanthey could earn while engaged in thattype of employment in the city of NewYork.But, what else does the present pro-gram do? The present AFDC program isa tremendous disincentive for anyone towork. I shall try to give you some factsabout this situation.Many of you feel like there ought tobe a reform, but when a reform comes down the road there are questions aboutIt. Did you know that there was not one solitary substantive alternative of-fered in the Committee on Ways andMeans during the course of the publichearings and In the executive sessions\u2014.and we were In executive sessions fordays and weeks on end on this program\u2014 nothing of substance was offered by any- one In substitution for this programwhich President Nixon hopes to breathelife into. His administration hss triedto breathe some life into this welfareprogram we now have.Mr. Chairman, the Members of theHouse know I have not been satisfiedwith the present program. We passedamendments in 1962 in the direction oftrying to provide some Inducement for H 3082peopleon welfare to get off it. Why?Because, as I said before, 60 out of every1,000 of our child population nationwideare on welfare. Ask anyone that is onit if that Is a preferable way to raise achild. In a home where there are nowork habits, in a home where there ishardly enough to eat, in a home wherethere are not enough clothes to wearand not enough to pay the rent. Youwill find there is very little incentive onthe part of that parent to see to It, eventhough the State law may require it, thatthat child even goes to grade school.Mr. Chairman, in 1967 we tried againand we provided an incentive. We put themandate on the States to see to it thatthese unfortunate people who had notraining or who had no jobs would begiven an opportunity for such training ifthey were qualified to absorb the trainingand then be given a job in keeping withthat training. Some of the States did afair job. The State of California has doneone of the best jobs of all States. TheState of New York did not even start itsprogram In a substantial way until a veryfew months ago. Whereas California hasreferred about 30 percent of the peopleon AFDC for training, New York has re-ferred less than 7 percent. Why? Be-cause certain people did not think it ap-propriate for any of these people to beassigned.Why do I feel so strongly about this?Alter a woman gets her youngest childto the age of 18 and she is on welfare,what Is left for her? In most States shemay be 45 years of age at that time. Shehas no training. Of course, she, knowshow to sweep the house, but she has noIndustrial training nor anything to com-mend her for a job and no work habits.She is past the age where people want toemploy a person for the first time. I thinkthat is one of the greatest tragedies thatperhaps exists on the dom\u00e7stic scene inthe United States today\u2014that we havenot tried to do something to help thatperson to help herself, to learn some oc-cupation before It becomes time for herto lose all opportunity for work and fortraining.So what happens? She has to move Intothe home of one of her daughters whohas minor children, and who is on wel-fare. This is why It Is that In some Stateswhere a 'welfare program was initiatedbefore the Federal program was enactedthat you have as many as four genera-tions, one after the other, four genera-tions on welfare. Since the adoption ofthe welfare program in many Statesthere is a percentage\u2014yes, it is small,but a. disturbing percentage to me evenif it is one or two people\u2014that representthe third generation on welfare.So we thought it was high time In 1962and In 1967 to try to do something aboutthis because of the disincentive to work,because of the fact that it was conduciveto the breaking up of homes, because ofthe States' variation In payments, be-cause of the overall rising cost of thisprogram.NOw, if there Is a man or woman Mem-ber of this House on the floor today whois satisfied with the present operation ofthe welfare program in his or her State,I would be glad to yield so that theyCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEcan tell me why it Is so good, and why Itis so perfect.No, you cannot say It is, and I know It.Thusshouid we not repeal It? Should wenot repeal it? That Is what we are doingin this bill. We are repealing the welfareprogram as It has 'been known up to now.'The1stof July, 1971, there will nolonger be a program of AFDC, there willno longer be a programof old-age as-sistance, or aid to the blind, or aid to thedisabled.What have we done? We have repealedthree programs applicable to adults, andwe have placed them under one program,and we apply the same formula of Fed-eral assistance across the board In allthree categories. And what are we doing?We are saying In the case of these adultprograms under this bill that we in Con-gress think that the bare minimum of in-come that a man 65 years of age or older,who has no other income, needs to sub-slston, Is $110 a month. And wesay to theStates, every one of them, by July 1, 1971,you are going to pay those people whoare 65 years of age and older, enough sothat their total income will reach $110 amonth and the same for the blind and thedisabled.We say we will pay 90 percent out ofthe Federal Treasury of the first $65 ofthe average payments to needy adults,and then we will pay 25 percent of thatwhich remains above the $65\u2014up to alimit set by the Secretary of Health, Edu-cation, and Welfare.We are placing a limitation on ourparticipation, but we are also placing afloor for the first time In Federal legisla-tion to see to it that these people, theseunfortunates referred to in the course ofthe debate on the rule, have enough tolive on.All right; that covers the adult partof the program, but it Is a major part,in my opinion, of this bill, the care ofthese unfortunate aged, bllnd, and dis-abled Individuals.What do we do with the AFDC pro-gram? We repeal It completely, and wedrastically change the approach and theconcept. Why? Because many of theStates found It impossible to even agreeto the mandate of the Federal law on oc-casion, or even to avail themselves of op-portunity to try to help these unfor-tunate people when we gave them thatopportunity in 1962.The 1st of July 1971, there will be anew Federal program replacing the States program known as AFDC.This new Federal program will becalled the family assistance plan.Yes, we established Federal standardsof eligibility\u2014we changed It from top tobottom, because the Federal Governmentwill pay the first $1,800 of benefits underthat program, In all of the States, Incases of a family of four, provided theydo the same thing.What do they have to do under pres-ent law? They go to the welfare officeand sign up. The Supreme Court saysthat If a man and his wife and chil-dren\u2014because in my State we have nottaken care of the unemployed fathers\u2014if he cannot find a job in Arkansas, hecan go to California where they havethe unemployed father program and canApril 15,1970apply for benefits the first day he landsin California. An individual can go fromany State where benefits are low to aState where the benefits are higher.You talk about a drain on the Statetreasuries? I do not know of any greaterdrain that we can experience on thedomestic scene than the migration ofpeople under the present program tothose States that have been more gen-erous with these unfortunate citizens.There is another group\u2014the so-calledworking poor. This Is perhaps the boneof contention In this whole bill. I hadserious doubts about covering them Inthe beginning. As I said publicly, the ad-ministration's new approach to familyassistance was good in every respect inmy mind except the fact that It mIghtadd 10 million or so people to the 10 mil-lion peonle already on welfare and thatit would cost an additional $4.4 billiona year to do it.But I became convinced that this wasthe 'right hinq to do. Let me tell you howI reached that conclusion.Where do the people who go on AFDCcome from in the first place? Do theycome from good-paying jobs that enablethem to own a home or to live in a veryfine apartment In your cities or In yourrural areas? Where do they come from?They come from this group of peoplethat we have grown accustomed to call-ing the working poor. As. fast as we havebeen able, under the present WIN pro-gram, adopted in 1967, to train peoplepresently on AFDC, there have been twoand three and four or more familiesadded to the rolls 'in these States forevery one that we have taken off.So, that looks to me like you are mak-ing progress\u2014retrogressively. We aremaking progress, but going backward atthe same time in reducing the cost andreducing the numbers on the rolls.Back in 1987, I had many, many let-ters from all over the United States. Ihad letters from New York City and fromChicago and-from the bigger cities andfrom the rural areas. They were sopleased that the Congress then was mov-ing in the direction of trying to providesome work incentive to try to get peoplewho are on relief back to jobs.These women, whose husbands haddivorced them or deserted them, and whodescribed themselves by race and all Intheir letters to me, described their situa-tions. They were living In an apartmenthouse. They were working and had fourchildren. But another woman who livedon the same floor around the corner fromthem had four children and they wereon welfare and did not work.In essence they were saying to me: \"Ithink it is asking too much of me to workto support my children and pay mytaxes\u2014and some of my taxes go to keepup this lady and her children when shewas further along in school when shequit than I was\u2014and .when she Is justas able to work as I am.\"It Is getting pretty bad when a personpoints out the difference in status be-tween neighbor and neighbor.You can call this bill anything youwant to, If you do not want to vote forchanging the present system. I can makea good argument against the bifi if I April 15,1.970wantedto do so, because I used to debateand all of us who did had to be able todebate both sides of the question. I couldmake a better argument against this billthan any argument I have yet heardmade by any of you, I believe, becausethe thoughts I heard expressed wentthrough my mind, too, to debate againstit. I think I could do it. Certainly I couldmake a plausible argument against it.Those of you who say that you arenever going to vote for a guaranteed an-nual income, let me talk to you a minute.I have said the same thing, and I willsay the same thing, and when I vote forthis bill I am not voting for a guaranteedannual income. What I am voting for isan amount, cail it whatever you wantto\u2014subsidy, relief, income, whatever youwant to call it\u2014I am voting for a sup-plement to the income of the Individualwho is working and not making enoughto supply his family with the ordinaryneeds of life, but who is not now on wel-fare. Why? Because I tell him, \"I will dothat for you, Mister, if you will go downto your nearest Employment SecurityOffices\" and we have them In everycounty of the United States, in everyState of the United States\u2014\"go downthere, sign up for work, and see first,whether they can find a job that pays youmore. If they do not, let them counselwith you. Go through their diagnosis.Let them prescribe a course of trainingfor you that they think you have theability to absorb, that will enlarge yourcapacities and make it possible for you toearn more money.\"But, second, I will pay this supple-ment and get this man to the employ-ment office because I am convinced thatwithin that man's lifetime, if somethingis not done, he will be one of the addi-tional millions that will be added to theAFDC program.Oh, you say, \"They will not accept itin my district.\"I want to talk to my southern friends.I said this in the Rules Committee. Whoare the working poor? What are theylike? Over 50 percent of the workingpoor families covered under the bill livein the South; only 12 percent live in theNortheast. A high proportion of suchfamilles live In rural areas and on smallfarms. Seventy percentof them arewhIte; 30 percent are nonwhite.I have said to chambers of commerceand every group I could talk to in myown congressional district and In my ownState that I am willing to pay any rea-sonable amount to help anyone in thatposition, to help him to improve so thathe can better help his family.What do I think about most in thiswhole affair? I think about the sad plightof many of these children. They havehad nothing to do with the ability oftheir father and mother to earn, or thewilllngess of their father or mother totake a job. They have had ndthing to dowith that. They have had nothing what-soever to do with whether the father hasleft home in order that they might go onwelfare. But they are the ones who suf-fer in the long run.Malnutrition and lack of medical at-tention from conception to 6 ye'krs of age,doctors tell me, can reduce a normallyCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014HOUSEborn child to the same mental condislonas that of a child who was born with aninjured brain.What is the future for such childrenas these? Nothing but more AFDC.Members can say what they want toabout the, definitions of suitable work. Icould find 101 things in .this bill I couldfuss about if I wanted to. I have nevertold this House that any piece of legisla-tion I have ever supported which comesfrom the Ways and Means Committeewas perfect. But do not be misled. Theterm \"suitable work\" is mentioned in theunemployment compensation laws. Thatis one thing. We do not requIre a carpen-ter who goes to the employment securityofficer In our State, in Members' Statesor In mine, to get his unemploymentcheck to lay aside his carpentry and takea job as a common laborer. No; that Isnot suitable employment within the defi-nition of that act.What does suitable employment meanhere In this bill? Let me tell Members.It means employment that is suitable tothat particular man's capabilities and histraining, along with some other obviousthings like the state of his health.There is talk about all these ways wehave left the door open for people to getout of the requirements to take work ortraining under the program. Well, Mem-bers can say a mother with children un-der 6 years of age ought to go to work.The committee did not. We felt that dur-ing those years before the child goes toschool, the mother should not be re-quired to take training, but when thatchild goes to school, then she will taketraining and she' willtaketraining knowing that the child of hers is receiv-ing just as good care or better care dur-ing the time she Is absent from It thatday, in a day-care center.We are going to arrange for this carewith the schools, we are going to arrangeIt with private organizations, with non-profit organizations. We are going to getthe very best of day care possible forthese children.This lady with a child under 6 can, Ifshe wants to, volunteer for training. DoMembers know that In the State of Cal-ifornia they have had more people withchildren under 6, volunteer for 'trainingthan they have had with any other groupof citizens?So do not tell me these people do notwant training. Do not tell me these peo-ple do not want a lifting hand to helpthem lift themselves up out of their eco-nomic circumstances.Yes, we have a few people that, do notwork as hard as others. I have knowndoctors and lawyers and businessmen,who I could say did not work as hardas others in their profession. There arepeople in my district that do not thinkI work as hard, for example, as the gen-tleman from Virginia, DICK P0FF,,pr thegentleman from Kentucky (Mr. PER-KINS), whom I see here In front of me.Oh, yes, they get critical of us some-times because they do not think wework as hard as another or the samehours as others, even though we get an equal amount of pay. Of course, manypeople do not know I have earned agreat deal of overtime since I have beenH3083in Congress for which I do not get paid\u2014and I know other Members have.But, as I say, do not characterize thesepeople generally as being lazy or shift-less or without motivation or desire. Mostof them are without training. That Iswhy they are where they are. So It Isimportant,I think, that we pass thislegislation and repeal what we have andstart over anew.If there had been any better way to doit than the way President Nixon gave us,we would have adopted it, but no sug-gestions came from within the commit-tee or from the general public eitherabout how to deal with it. This is largelythe President's plan.During its deliberations the principalefforts of the Committee on Ways andMeans were In the direction of strength-ening the provisions of the legislation toassure the establishment of an effectivework and training program, buildingupon the groundwork that has been laidin putting the existing work Incentiveprogram into operation. It Is the clearintention of the committee, based uponassurances given by the Secretary ofHealth, Education, and Welfare and theSecretary of Labor, that the work andtraining program wifi provide a methodof guaranteeing that all adult membersof families receiving assistance under thefamily assistance plan will receive allavailable training and employment serv-ices and other supportive services, in-cluding child care, necessary to assistthem in obtaining employment and ulti-mately attaining self-support.I cannot emphasize too strongly thatall adult family assistance recipients,except for those specifically e'empted bythe bill, must register for training oremployment. Contrary to the adminis-tration's proposal, under. the committeebill this requirement applies to the work-ing poor as well as to those who areUnemployed or working part time. Thisis an essential difference and a materialImprovement In thebifi. Under thismodification, the employment status ofmany of the working poor parents willbe improved and upgraded.I would liketo emphasize In thestrongest possible terms, Mr. Chairman,that the Commitee on Ways and Meansand its staff Intends to monitor, con-stantly and closely, the operation of thework and training provisions of this leg-islation. We are relying heavily uponthese provisions to take substantial num-bers of families off of welfare or sub-stantially reduce their dependency.We placed reliance upon the provi-sions of the 1967 amendments establish-ing the work incentive program and weredisappointed with the records of achieve-ments In many of the States. I think wehave at least gained much useful ex-perience under the WD program whichwe will benefit from In putting the workand training provisions of this bill Intooperation. For instance, we have learnedthat it Is necessary to have a mandatoryregistration provision, requiring all thoseadult recipients who are not specificallyexcluded under the bill to register. Wewill no longer tolerate the situation Insome States where the philosophical in-clinations of social workers and admlxi- H 3084istrators have replaced the basic Intentof Congress.I believe that the present WIN opera-tions can be very easily adapted to theprovisions of this bill, and I fully expectearly and encouraging results. I also ex-pect that the Committee on Ways andMeans will be kept informed as to theprogress that Is made in the work andtraining program. The nature and extentof the information the committee hasreceived concerning the WIN programhas not been sufficient for it to do theoversight job it deems necessary, andthe committee expects that an Improve-ment In the WIN information systemswill be forthcoming.Mr. Chairman, another significant con-tribution of the committee in develop-ing the legislation was the addition ofa provision holding parents who abandontheir families responsible for Federal as-sistance received by their families. Thisprovision was added to the bill to act asa brake upon parental desertion andbirths out of wedlock, two of the mostsignificant problems that plague thepresent AFDC program. This new ap-proach plus greater emphasis by theFederal Government and the States Inimplementing the determination of pa-ternity, the location of absent parents,and the enforcement of support pro-visionsofthe1967SocIalSecurityAmendments should have some effect inreducing the growth of the assistancerolls.I think it well to remind that we didenact such provisions that were ap-proved just a little over 2 years ago onJanuary 2, 1968. In a sense, this legisla-tion is building upon the welfare reformswe started at that time. These provi-sions have just recently been put intooperation in most States and their effectsare just starting to be felt. The commit-tee discussed their operation with rep-resentativesoftheDepartmentof Health, Education, and Welfare in ex-ecutive session and received assurancesthat they will be vigorously applied Inthe future. As I said with respect to thework and training provisions a momentago, I repeat with respect to these pro-visions that the committee will be look-ing closely at their operation aid expectsto be kept fully informed concerningthem.The greatest loss of resources that wehave in the United States, that we havehad throughout our history In the UnitedStates,is the loss of that individualtrained to the maximum of his ability.I would hope that the House wouldpass this bill, finding it, as I am surethe Members will as they study it, farpreferable to the provisions of existinglaw.I have said very frankly I cannot giveanyone any guarantee as to what is goingto happen under it. I thought in 1962there would be more people put to workwhen we gave the States the responsibil-ity to administer the work-training pro-gram. I thought in 1967 there would bemore put to work when we told the Statescertain recipients had to participate, butthe States did not find enough of themsuitable for training and work. That Iswhy, under the bill before us, they haveCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSElost the opportunity to be copartners withus in this enterprise.My friends from the South, I wouldurge you above anybody else in thisHouse to be for this legislation. It willdo more, in my opinion, for-the South-ern States than any proposition I haveever had the privilege of supporting orbeing for on the floor of the House. Thinkof it: 50 percent of the total number ofall of these poor working families arein our several Southern States.SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS OF HR. 16311Mr. Chairman, let me now briefly de-scribe the principal provisions of thebill, including those which I have al-ready mentioned.This bill is introduced on behalf ofmyself and the gentleman from Wis-consin at the direction of the committee.I want to take occasion, Mr. Chairman,to express my appreciation for the at-tendance, cooperation, and assistancegiven us in the.committee by every mem-ber of the committee, on both sides, inthe development of the provisions of thebill.This bill makes amendments in thoseprograms of the Social Security Actthat provide for cash public assistancepayments to needy individuals and f am-ilies.SpecificallyItprovidesmajor amendments in the public assistanceprograms under titlesI,IV, X, XIV,and XVI of the Social Security Act;most significantly, in the program of aidto families with dependent children.The bill consists, as Members can seefrom reading it, of four titles. Title Irevises and Improves the assistance pro-gram for needy families\u2014part A of titleIVoftheSocialSecurityAct,or \"AFDC.\" This part of the bill replacesthe existing AFDC program with thebasic Federal family assistance plan forall needy families, including the workingpoor, and a program for State supple-mental payments. This title includesnew and expanded work incentives andrequirements and an expanded and im-proved program for clild care and sup-porting services. It also includes provi-sions under which the States could agreeto have direct Federal administrationof all of the cash assistance programs.Title II provides for a mInimum pay-ment level of $110 a month for each re-cipient under the federally assisted adultpublic assistance program; a new Fed-eral matching formula wlth respect toadult assistance which is more favorableto the States; and other Improvementsin the public assistance programs for theaged, blind, and disabled, consolidatingtitles I, X, and XIV in a revised titleXVI.Titles III and VI contain miscellane-ous and conforming provisions and cer-tain general provisions.FAMILY ASSISTANCEThe bill would make basic reforms Inthe program which furnishes assistanceto needy families with children by pro-viding:First, a new basic Federal family as-sistance plan, with federally assisted State supplementation, for poor familieswith children in place of the present pro-gram of aid to families wIth dependentchildren, but including for the first timeApril 15,1970coverage of poor families regardless ofthe work status of the father. The Stateswould not be required to supplementpayments to the working poor;Second, requirements that, as a pre-requisite to receipt of benefits, everyadult In the assisted families\u2014exceptthose who are specifically exempted, suchas mothers with preschool children orpersons who are ill or of advanced agebut Including -adults already working\u2014must register at the employment officefoi work or training or sign up for voca-tional rehabilitation If handicapped;Third, uniform, nationwide eligibilityre4uirements and payment procedures,both for the basic Federal family assist-ance plan and the State supplementarypayments; andFourth, new provisions holding 4esert-Ing parents responsible for Federal pay-ments made to their families under thefamily assistance or State supplementaryplans.WORK AND TRAiNINOThe bill Improves the program of em-ployment and training services and ofother services\u2014including child care\u2014needed by recipients who are registeredat employment offices by providing:First, a new program of manpower,training, and employment services to beadministered by the Secretary of Laborthrough the State employment offices;Second, a Federal program of full-cost grants and contracts for child careservices to enable mothers who are re-quired to register for training and em-ployment,\u2014as well as those who regis-ter on a voluntary basis\u2014to participatein work or training;Third, a new system of providingservices to support training or employ-ment through agreements between theFederal Government and the States;andFourth, a more equitable, uniform,and effective system of incentive allow-ances and reimbursement of work ex-penses.ADULT ASSISTANCEThe bill would substantially improvethe effectiveness of the adult assistanceprograms under the Social Security Actby providing:First, that the States assure that eachaged, blind, or disabled adult will receiveassistance sufficient to bring his total in-come up to $110 a month; andSecond, a simplified Federal match-ing formula which will result in gen-erally more favorable Federal participa-tion in the cost pf payments.I think, we all would agree, Mr. Chair-man, that the adult public assistance re-ciplents\u2014the old,the halt, and theblind\u2014are most deserving of any addi-tional help we can give them.MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONSThe bill also contains a number ofmiscellaneous and conforming amend-ments that are necessary in order forthe family assistance plan to work insmoothly with the provisions of 'pres-ent law. While there are certain refer-ences to the medicaid program and tothe parts of the law dealing with serv-ices for needy families, the committee isnot making any substantive amend-ments to these programs at this time. April 15, 1970OTHSZ SOCIAL SECtJRTIT LEGISLATION PENDINGBEFORE THE COMMPrrEEThe committee Is enrrently consider-ing additional amendments to the SocialSecurity Act relating to the medicare andmedicaid programs and we expect to con-sider amendments to the social securitycasE benefits program soon. And, the De-partment of Health, Education, and Wel-I are has Indicated that It hopes to soonforward proposals relating to the socialservices provisions of the Social SecurityAct for our consideration. The bill be-fore us today relates essentially only tocash welfare payments\u2014It Is not directedto issues relating to services for welfarerecipients.Some of you may recall that last win-ter, when we were considering the 15-percent social security cash benefit Increase that was enacted In December, IIndicated that we hoped to have addi-tional amendments to the social securitycash benefits program ready for consid-eration by the House by the end of Marchof thIs year. However, as I have said be-fore, when we reconvened thIs January,It was the Department's wish\u2014as -ex-pressed by Under. Secretary John G. The new welfare proposal does easethe costs of welfare to most of the States,shifting a greater burden to the FederalGovernment. Overall, according to esti-mates of the Department of Health,Education, and Welfare, the bill deVel-oped by the committee shows slightlygreater fiscal relief to the States thanthe bill that was originally Introdupedby the President. In general, the effectof the committee changes In the admin-istration bill is to give more savings tothose States which have been makinggreater fiscal effort in their welfare pro-grams.It Is estimated that the combined Im-pact of the family assistance plan andthe program for adults will be a net re-duction In State expenditures for cashassistance in all but about nine States.With regard to the States whose expend!-tures would be Increased, there Is a spe-cial saving provision in the bill whichprovides that, for the first 2 fiscal yearsunder the program, the Federal Govern-ment will meet any additional Statecosts that result from the enactment ofthe family assistance plan or the pro-posed new title XVI for the needy aged,blind and disabled.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014HOUSEVeneman\u2014that we first consider thewelfare reform proposals. And, as I haveindicated, our work on the welfare re-form proposals has been very time con-suming.COST AND FISCAL IMPACTMr. Chairman, the American peoplewant to be certain, and should be ableto be certain, that when, of necessity,money is spent for assistance payments,it is spent in such a way as to promotethe public interest, and the public well-being of our people. While this bill doesentail substantial increases in Federalexpenditures for welfare payments inthe short run, I think we have built intothe bill, for the long run, provisions thatwill mean that we can begin to hold theline in the future. For example, the De-partment of Health, ducation, and Wel-fare estimates that over the period 1971\u201475, Federal payment costs under presentlaw would increase by about 62 percent,yhereas under HR. 16311 they are ex-pected to increase by only about 15 per-cent. This data is set forth in table lxon page 53 of the committee report,which I insert at this point in theRECORD: CONCLUSIONMr. Chairman, this bill deals with amost controversial subject. It will notplease everybody; it would be impossibleto do so. Some will say that by providingbenefits to working poor families, wewould be starting down the road to aguaranteed income program. I do notagree, because the bill also requires theemployable adults In these poor fain-ilies\u2014working or otherwise\u2014to registerfor training or employment services, thusbringing them under a program that willassist them in Improving their skills andincreasing their Income. My uriderstar\u00e7I-Ing of a guaranteed income system isone that gives an individual a choice ofnot working and settling at a certainincome and living standard, the standardthat is guaranteed. This the bill certainlydoes not do. It offers no such choice. Itsays to the employable adult-members ofassisted families: \"You must accept suit-able employment or training or lose yourwelfare payment, and if need be have thepayments to your family made to some-one outside the family.\" There is a greatdifference between this legislation and aguaranteed annual income.It cannot be expected that this wel-113085fare reform proposal can solve all of ourcountry's grevlous social problems. Butthere Is reason to think that It will be ahighly significant step forward. It Is de-signed to promote individual integrityand efforts toward self-help. It is de-signed to help to stabilize poor families.These are important goals, and if westart to attain them, we will have madea valuable contribution toward improvingthe lives of the needy people of thiscountry.The CHAIRMAN. The time yielded bythe gentleman from Arkansas has againexpired.Mr. MILLS. Mr. Chairman, I yieldmyself 5 additional minutes for the pur-pose of answering questions.Mr. ASHBROOK. Mr. Chairman, willthe gentleman yield for one question?Mr. MILLS. I yield to the gentlemanfrom Ohio (Mr. ASHBROOK).Mr. ASHBROOK. There will be manyquestions raised later In the debate, butthere is one point which I believe wouldhelp to clarify this at this time.First I should like to thank the gen-tlemen from the Ways and Means Com-mittee, speaking as a person not in favorof this bl,Jl, for I would say the com-mittee has been 100 percent helpful Inproviding information to me which Ihope I can use to help In this debate toshed light on the subject.I note that the gentleman in his re-marks mentioned the situation underthe present law where a family on wel-fare could get more than a family work-ing full time at the minimum wage ornear minimum wage, referred to.I am sure the gentleman would notwant to leave the impression this earlyin the debate that this bill would cosnpletely alleviate that situation.Mr. MILLS. It may not in some States.Mr. ASHBROOK. It would narrow thesituation, rather than bring about asituation where there would be an abso-lute work incentive In every case.Mr. MILLS. It would not cover allcases.The gentleman very kindly gave me acopy of his figures. What he is doing inhis figures Is including many things thatare not within this bifi.There is a reference to medicaid. Themedicaid program may be available bothunder the welfare program and for theworking poor, depending entirely on theState law.The food stamp program may or maynot be utilized by these people. It is notutilized by all of them. If It were it wouldcost several more billion a year, some-one told me, and we do not appropriateanything like that amount for it now.What I am talking about is what theindividuals have In cash as a result ofbeing on welfare, working and receivingthis supplemental payment under thefamily benefit program.Mr. ASHBROOK. On that point, willthe gentleman not agree, regardless ofwhether he has another set of figuresor what the case might be, nonetheless,even If this bill were to be fully imple-mented it would not totally alleviate thesituation he referred to, where there IsIn some cases the ability to get as muchTABLE IX.\u2014POTENT1AL FEDERAL COSTS UNDER COMMITTEE BILL COMPARED TO EXISTING LEGISLATION, 1971\u201475*tin billions of dollarsi 19711972197319741975 Committee bill:Payments to families with children30 percent matching of State supplementals. -SubtotalFederal share of adult category costTotalExisting legIslatIon:Federal 33.42.53.92.74.52. 84.55.25.96.67.3A5me that, with Constant benefit levels, family assistance gross payment decline slightly.

The gentlemantold me they worked to narrow the dis-incentive.Mr. MILLS. There is no question aboutthe total.Mr. ASHflROOK. Even if thebill passes, it could not be said we had a1leviated the situation, where there wouldnot be a situation where a nonworkingwelfare family would receive more.Mr. MILLS. That is true. We are onlyhelping them up to the poverty level, andIt is my recollection that at least oneState has a line of assistance underAFDC which is quite a bit above thepoverty level and some of the otherStates have payments, depending on thesize of the family in those States, thatwould be above the poverty level. So weare not going to help the States underthis with levels above the poverty level.We help them up to that poverty level.Mr. ASHBROOK. I thank the gentle-man.Mr. ICHORD. Mr. Chairman, will yield?Mr. MILLS. I yield to the gentlemanfrom Missouri.Mr. ICHORD. I want to thank the dis-tinguished gentleman from Arkansas forhis usually excellent presentation.First of all, I want to state that I donot think there has ever been a bill inthe Congress in the 10 years that I havebeen here that I have personally hadmore difficulty on in making up my mindas to how to vote.I have two questions of the gentlemanfrom Arkansas.You mentioned the fact that the AFDCprogram had doubled in cost during thelast 2 years previous.Mr. MILLS. Three years, I say.Mr. ICHOR.D. There are now 1.? mil-lion families drawing AFDC.Mr. MILLS. That is approximately 10million individuals all together on allwelfare programs.Mr. ICHORD. The gentleman did notbreak that 1.7 million families down intothose where the father, the male, hadleft the home for some reason or wherethere had been no marriage in the fam-ily. Would the gentleman advise me asto what part of this 1.7 million familiesfall In that latter category?Mr. MILLS. About 75 percent wherethe father Is not in the home. About 75percent .of the total number are in thatcategory and about 25 percent In theremaining part.Mr. ICHORD. One more question Iwould like to have the gentleman an-swer. The gentleman in his presentationhas only spoken as to income require-ments. Are there any asset requirementsfor eligibility under this?Mr. MILLS. Oh. yes. We have assetrequirements.Mr. ICHORD. What are those?Mr. MILLS. We disregard assets up to$1,500. A home or personal effects donot count against the $1,500 limitation.That Is done in many States, anyway,under present law.Mr. ICHORD. You mean the homewould be exempt and not counted aapart of the $1,500?Mr. MILLS. That is right.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEMr. ICHORD. I thank the gentleman.Mr. MILLS. I now yield to the gen-tleman from Pennsylvania.The CHAIRMAN. The time of the gen-tleman has again expired.Mr. MILLS. Mr. Chairman, I yieldmyself 2 additional minutes.I yield to the gentleman from Penn-sylvania (Mr. DENT).Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I want thegentleman to understand my vote on theprevious question does not indicate myfinal vote on the legislation one way oranother. I voted in that instance becauseI would have liked to have seen an openrule in that we are studying the min-imum wage laws. We are faced withthe problem of creating a new base forthat. However, under the minimum wagelaw and all of the major unioiDcontractsthat I have seen there is no such thingas a family consideration for the pay-ment of wages or income based on thenumber of children in the family andthe number of dependents. The only pro-gram that was anywhere near like thisprogram that I knew about was whenwe were studying the national levels ofincome ,with low rates. We found inFrance that they have a program where-by all employers paid into a fund but allpaid the same wage. However, for eachchild over and above two in that familythey had a common pool which wouldpay back into the family or to the head of the family enough money to give theman income, such as we are doing here.If a person has two children or fourchildren, he would have a guaranteedminimum income under this law of $3,-900.Mr. MILLS. No. He would not havethat much.Mr. DENT. I am not talking about re-lief. I understand this better than someof my colleagues who have been con-demning my vote on this. It gives a guar-anted minimum income for relief\u2014Mr. MILLS. That is right.Mr. DENT. But it does not increasethe relief payment one cent. It mighthelp the treasury of a State that doesnot have a higher payment.Mr. MILLS. That is right.Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, if the gen-tleman will yield further, what will hap-pen is that those who are not workingnow under the present minimum wagelaw, if they worked 52 weeks a year andevery eligible work day in that calendaryear which they could work, if they havea family of 4, 6, 8, or 10, they can earn$3,338 total income under this bill. Butwe are saying that we have recognizedthat to be too small and I want you toknow that I think It is too small at thistime.Mr. MILLS. It is the level to which onerefers as the poverty level.Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, if the gen-tleman will yield further, I want it clearlyunderstood that we are now studying theminimum wage and we have to take acompletely new view of it because in ourconsideration of the minimum wage wehad to take into consideration the basicincome and what would be the povertylevel. Since these guidelines are in herewe will have to establish the minimumwage on the same basis as the guidelinesApril 15, 1970of a dependent child in the family, orelse\u2014Mr. MILLS. What we are trying to do,if I may interject, to state the facts ofthe bill\u2014what we are trying to do is totake care of a whole lot of people thatdo not even get your present-day mini-mum wage.Mr. DENT. I understand that. I willsay to the gentleman from Arkansas, butI want to explain clearly that if we donot do that, if we establish a minimumwage for a family of four on the basis ofwhat you have established it here\u2014andthat is as high as you could probablygo without creating a great deal of op-position at this time\u2014if that same per-son happens to have four children will hebesubsidized from the Governmentthrough the employer who is only pay-ing the minimum wage?What I want to do is to provide lan-guage in here with a percentage baseover the poverty level rather than a perchild dependent figure. Tjnder that pro-cedure, I think there would be an Incen-tive for a worker who is working at thepresent minimum because he will not beable under any minimum wage law tokeep from working for an employer ifhe has 10 chilren and working at a mini-mum wage.Mr: MILLS, We provide for traininghere, as the gentleman knows, but westill must have a program under anyconcept of relief which Is based upon thesize of the family and the needs of thefamily. We maintain that concept here.Mr. DENT. I understand that and Icomplimentyou,becausesomething must be done about it. But what do I doabout the minimum wage? What do Iestablish for a family of 4, 6, 8, or 10?What do we pay out of the Treasury?That is what I want to know.The CHAIRMAN. The time of the gen-tleman from Arkansas has again expired.Mr. MILLS, Mr. Chairman, I yieldmyself 2 addltonal minutes.Mr. MAHON. Mr. Chairman, will I to the gentlemanfrom Texas.(Mr. MAHON asked and was givenpermission to revise and extend his re-marks.)Mr. MAHON. As the gentleman knowsI have great admiration and respectfor the ability of the gentleman fromArkansas and for his dedication.Mr. MILLS. I know It Is not my argu-mentative ability, and, as the gentlemanknows, I have the greatest respect forhim, and especially so when the gen-tleman and Iare together on thesematters.Mr. MAHON. The thing that concernsnie, and I believe many others, is that attimes we pass legislation incurring addi-tional expenditures without adequatelyconsidering whether or not the revenuesare available.Mr. MILLS. I am glad the gentlemanbrings that up.Mr. MAHON. I would like to take amoment, if I may, to pursue this further.As the gentleman knows, under the ad-ministrative budget which was In useprior to fiscal year 1969, the budget forthe current fiscal year would be in the ApriL 15, 1970redby the estimated sum of about $8billion. -Wehave just voted for a pay increasefor Federal civilian and military em-ployees, and so forth. Many are verymuch interested In more money for edu-catio\u00fc and more money with which tofight pollution. I, personally, cannot seehow we can carry out these programswithout raising additional revenue.My question is this: Does the gentle-man see any way that we can financethese programs without raising addi-tional revenue? It Is easy to get spend-ing bills through but It Is hard to getrevenue-raising billsthrough, as thegentleman knows better than I.I wish the gentleman would explainwhether or not he thinks that the pend-Ing billis going to cause additionalspending, and cost additional revenue?And In view of the whole environment,the whole atmosphere, the trend of thetimes, Is. it inevitable that we will haveto raise taxes, and probably early?Mr. MILLS. Let me answer the gen-tleman this way. First of all, this doesnot affect the upcoming fiscal situationfor fiscal year 1971 except to the extentthat some day-care centers may be estab-lished, which are already provided forunder existing law, to help care for thechildren of the mothers who will availthemselves of the WIN training pro-grams which were established in 1967.None of this goes into effect, none ofit, In this proposed program, none of it,even the enlarged payments to the el-derly, until July 1, 1971. That is the firstday that any part of this can go intoeffect.There are two reasons for this. Firstof all, all of the States will have to amendtheir laws in order to comply with thenew adult assistance program; and, sec-ond, we are trying to do even better thanthe President himself was doing by notimposing any of those costs upon whatI thought was already a very tight budgetsituation for the 1971 fiscal year. He didactually budget expense for some of thisto go into effect In fiscal year 1971, butthe committee decIded.we would let nopart of it go into effect until 1971. Andwe have been criticized in some quartersbecause of that.But to me this whole thing of Federalspending is a question of priorities, asI know the gentleman knows.I will tell you one thing: I think someof these problems we have at home, andsome of the trends that we have at homethat can be corrected and improved bysome new program that may ost someadditional amount in the immediate fu-ture, must be related in importance tosome of the programs that we perhapshave had on the books for many, manyyears. We have to determine whether ornot those programs which have eatendeeply into the Treasury, are worth-while programs, or whether there Is something new we should adopt.If we took the position that the budgetwas so tight because of all of our oldprograms that we could never do any-thing new, we would never solve anyproblems that might be on the horizon.The CHAIRMAN. The time of the gen-tleman has again expired.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEMr. MILLS. Mr. Chairman, I yieldmyself 2 additional minutes.Mr. MAHON. Mr. Chairman, will thegentleman yield further?Mr. MILLS. Let me carry on just brief-ly, because I have not answered thegentleman fully.You must also compare this new pro-gram, and what is capable of being doneunder it through proper attention andproper administration, with what willoccur under existing programs, which,as I said, some people within the De-partment of Health, Education, and Wel-fare predicted for aid to families withdependent children and other elementsof cash welfare, that it will cost around$12 billion Just 4 fiscal years from now.This new program altogether will bea material amount of money. It will costsomewhere in the neighborhood of $8billion by fiscal year 1975, all added to-gether. But I think the program underpresent law, contrary to some tables thatwe have in the report, even will cost usat least $4 billion more by fiscal 1975because recipients will not be taken offand put to work under the existing law,and they will be under this program.Mr.. MAHON. Let us assume that thishas very little Impact in fiscal 1971\u2014Mr. MILLS. It does not have any.Mr. MAHON. But there are many otherprograms not related to this.Mr. MILLS. I am not in favor of delay-ing or stopping this program because thegentleman's committee may want to add$1 billion to something else. I might voteagainst that $1 billion amendment. Ithink this program Is entitled to a veryhigh priority, just as I think the e4uca-tion of our children enjoys a very highpriority.Mt MAHON. Can we do the thingsthat we are going to want to do withoutproviding additional revenue?Mr. MILLS. We are not providing forone penny of cost over the program thatthe President submitted to us.The President mentioned this pro-gram as the first matter of legislationwhen he appeared here and gave us hisstate of the Union message. Welfare re-form was the first thing he wanted done.To me welfare is one of the most im-portant domestic Issues that faces us. Ifwe can ever get out of Vietnam\u2014if 'weever get out of that problem we mustavoid what the Department of Defensewas able to do when we found with re-spect to the 1970 budget that we couldcut back the dollar cost of Vietnam by$34 billion. Who got It? You know whogot it under the President's budget.\u2014both Presidents' budgets. What the Con-gress made available\u2014the President didnot spend it all\u2014we gave right back tothe Department of Defense for other pur-poses. I will say, I am not going to argueon priority here. But I do not know butwhat this has about as much priority asthe solution of some of the things forwhich we spend the taxpayer's dollarstoday. I am not talking about defense,but I am talking about some domesticprograms.Mr. LANDRUM, Mr. Chairman, willthe gentleman yield?Mr. MILLS. I the gentlemanfrom Georgia.H 3087Mr. LANDRUM. Mr. Chairman, thegentleman, In response to a questionpropounded by the gentleman fromTexas (Mr. MAHON) has not, in my judg-ment, answered categorically what oughtto be stated here. It seems to me, theanswer ought to be, \"Yes, we are goingto have to raise more money.\"Mr. MILLS. No; I am not going to saythat. If it becomes necessary, I will sayI will be out on the House floor sup-porting it.Mr. LANDRUM. Will the gentlemanpermit me to say one sentence further?Mr. MILLS. Go ahead.Mr. LANDRUM. Immediately follow-ing the disclosures last summer by Pres-ident Nixon on television of his welfarereform proposal, there came on thescreen a panel of folks in this field ofwelfare and among them was formerSecretary of Health, Education, and Wel-fare, Mr. Wilbur Cohen, and Mr. Moyni-han of the White House\u2014and Mr. Moyni-han said, as I recall it, as we had all dur-ing our committee sessions, that this billwould cost no more than $4 billion or $5 billion additional money.Mr. Cohen, who supports this programand who is a part of its genesis\u2014Mr. MILLS. No, no.Mr. LANDRUM. I am not talkingabout the bill\u2014I am talking about theprogram and I am talking about thephilosophy of it.Mr. MILLS. Oh, yes.Mr. LANDRUM. He Is a part of itsgenesis and we know that. We may aswell admit that he is a brilliant m.an inhis field. He said, \"No, not $4 '/ billionor $5 billion, but it Is much closer to $14billion or $15 billion.\" I am talking ofthe fiscal year 1971, I am talking aboutthis program that Is on the way and thereIs not going to be any revision of thesurtax.Mr. MILLS. My friend, the gentlemanfrom Georgia, has I think been misledby a lot of statements made by a lot ofpeople. If Wilbur Cohen said that, hedoes not know what he is talking about.He does not know what he is talkingabout in some of these programs withrespect to the costs\u2014and he is a greatfriend of mine. Just do not be misled bythat\u2014do not be misled, I mean, by fol-lowing just everything that Wilbur says.I just never could follow everything hesaid. But you ask him if he would not gofurther with this program and I willguarantee that h will say\u2014yes. Maybewhat he wanted was a program whichcost $14 or $15 billion.Mr. LONG of Maryland. Mr. Chair-man, will the gentleman yield?Mr. MILLS. I yield to the gentlemanfrom Maryland.Mr. LONG of Maryland. I am one ofthose who Is seeking guidance on this. Ihave not made up my mind one way oranother.Mr. MILLS. Before the gentleman asksme his question, would you not admitthat the greatest loss of resources thatwe have is the idleness of these people?Mr. LONG of Maryland. I agree withthat, sir. That has a bearing on my ques-tion. The gentleman has Indicated thatone of the reasons why this bill mightnot coat us much as present programs, as H 3088many people think, Is because there areincentives here to put people to work inother programs. It has been my under-standing, and I have not made a study ofthis, but only heard of cases, that therehas been a pilot program on the questionof whether the\u00e1e guaranteed annual In-come programs would give people theincentive to work. My understazding Isthey have been generally Inconclusiveand do not show anything much in oneway or another.I wonder if the gentleman would throwsome light on that?Mr. MILLS. You do not want ever todraw a conclusion from an experimentlike this conducted over, say, a year'stime or some such limited period. A manconducting it will want 'you to give him2 or 3 years to report on experiencesunder it. But the experience so far inconnection with the New Jersey-Penn-sylvania project, which Is the one towhich the gentleman is referring\u2014andthere is one about to begin In North Car-olina if It has not already started\u2014Isthat It indicates that their final reportwill indicate the success of that experi-ment. They have had suocees in differ-ent income levels up to date. But theycould go on In the next month andsomething could reverse it. So far theyhave had no reversals.Let me read just exactly what theysayInthereport.Thesearethe preliminary results of the New Jerseyexperiment.We believe that these preliminary datasuggest that fears that a family assistanceprogram wouldresultinextreme, unusual,or unanticipated responses are unfounded.There Is no evidence that work effort de-clined among those receiving Income supportpayments. On the contrary, there Is an in-dication that the work effort of participantsreceiving payments increased relative to thework effort of those not receiving payments.Mr. PUCINSKI. Mr. Chairman, will thegentleman yield?Mr. MILLS. I yield to the gentlemanfrom Illinois.Mr. PUCINSKI. Obviously, the key tothe success or failure of this programare the child care centers.Mr. MILLS. Yes, I would agree to that,plus the attention you give to training.Mr. PUCINSKI. The question I have,Mr. Chairman, because obviously thelargest number of recipients under theseprograms are mothers with small chil-dren, Is this: Is there an override Inthis legislation where a federally fi-nanced day care center which falls tomeet local zoning codes or building codescan operate? One of the problems acrossthe country, one reason why the pro-gram has been a failure, Is that churcheswant to participate\u2014Mr. MILLS. There Is no question butwhat churches and schools can have day-care centers. They have them. They canoperate day-care centers. Schools canoperate day-care centers. As I saidearlier, nonprofit organizations can setthem up. They can be set up by anygroup,The Secretary has the authority to seeto it that they are operated under soundhealth and safety rules.Mr. PUCINSKI. If they fail to meet alocal building code\u2014CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014 HOUSEMr. MILLS. If they do not meet alocal building code you do not think theSecretary would qualify them, do you?If they cannot meet 'the present Statestandards, he will not talk to them. ButIf the State does not have any standards,then, of course, he can make up his ownmind whether the program is operated ina healthy and safe manner.Mr. VANIK. Mr. Chairman, will thegentleman yield?Mr. MILLS. I yield to the gentlemanfrom Ohio.Mr. VANIK. I appreciate the gentle-man's thorough explanation of the bill,and I support the bill. I would like toinquire whether a fully trained unem-ployed worker covered by unemploy-ment benefits with three dependents,who exercised his unemployment com-pensation benefits for prolonged unem-ployment, for better than a year, whethersuch a person would be permitted to par-ticipate in the program without dispos-ing of his equity In his home or hisequity in his automobile.Mr. MILLS. He would. That Is alsotrue In the States that disregard the own-ership of a home and take care of thefamily with an unemployed father. Thegentleman knows about 50 percent ofthem do that now.Mr. CAREY. Mr. Chairman, will thegentleman yield?Mr. MILLS. I yield to the gentlemanfrom New York.Mr. CAREY. I wish to commend thegentleman in the well, the Chairman,for the way In which he has exoneratedmy reasoning and rationale on the oldbill,the 1967 amendments that youbrought forth. At that time I had a col-loquy with the distinguished chairmanand I predicted that with the rate of in-crease of beneficiaries coming on the rollsIn New York City, the cost of the pro-gram would triple. I wish r had not beenso accurate.Mr. MILLS. I wish it had merely trip-led. It Is more than that.Mr. CAREY. We could foresee that.Mr. MILLS. We did not offer enoughincentive, I guess, for the city to referwelfare recipients to work and training'programs.Mr. CAREY. Let me indicate why Ithink we are on the right track on thisbill.Mr. MILLS. Mr. Chairman, I yield tothe gentleman from New York.Mr. CAREY. Mr. Chairman, aside fromthe experiment the chairman referred to,in New York City, acting on our ownInitiative, faced with an Increase of 20,-000 new cases a month coming on therolls, we undertook some experiments inallowing the workers to keep certain In-come from the welfare benefit, coupledwith an incentive, to Work, and the re-quirement to take upgrading training.We found the flow of cases to the wel-fare rolls was beginning to decrease from20,000 to 7,000 a thonth. We have seenmovement off the rolls for the first time.So much of what the gentleman 18describing has been experImented withfavorably in New York City. ThereforeI think it deserves a chance.Mr. MILLS. Mr. Chairman, let us seewhere we would be If we decided not topass this legislation In the House, andApril 15, 1970I will leave It In the hands of Membersand to their good judgment. We will b:without any change in the present wel-fare system, because the committee andthose on the outside, in looking at thiswhole matter, have been unable to comeup with any other changes that we couldmake that would offer any hope of cur-tailing the rising costs of some of theseprograms. This Is all we could think of.We could not possibly get back to thefloor any tIme this year with somethingnew unless somebody who has not talkedabout it in the past would come forwardwith something new.I think we ought to give them achance to have this program. 'I think itcan work. As I said to those in the ad-ministration, I hope they will give it theamount of attention required. They mustsee to it that the employment officesgive to It the amount of attention neededin counseling these people and in diag-nosing them and in training them andin offering them a job.But, as we told the departments, letus not train these people for employmentthat does not exist. Let us not train themfor jobs that have disappeared. Let ustake the business community into thisand let us find out what jobs within anarea are going begging\u2014and they aregoing begging, my friends. Let us findout what they are. Let us 'train peoplefor these jobs. The worst thing we cando from the point of view of the moraleof these people is to spend 6 monthstraining them only to have them find,when they walk up and down the streets,that nobody wIll employ them. Let usnot have that happen. If we do not letIt happen, then the program can succeed.The CHAIRMAN. The Chairman ad-vises the gentleman from Arkansas hehas consumed 58 minutes.The Chair recognizes the gentlemanf rem Wisconsin.Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin. Mr. Chair-man, I yield myself 15 minutes. Mr.Chairman, I know of no more complexor serious problem, among the numerousproblems that require solution, than theproblem of dealing with our present Fed-eral-State-local welfare programIf we could find the perfect solutionby waving a magic wand to insure thatno families with children remain belowthe poverty level, we would all feel muchhappier. But that Is not the situation weface. Instead, we have the existing pro-gram of aid to families with dependentchlldren\u2014AFDC\u2014that was designed toassist families with children who havebeen deprived of parental support bydeath, Incapacity, or continued absencefrom the home and who do not have suf-ficient income or resources to keep bodyand soul together, to provide food, cloth-ing, and shelter. But we know that thisAFDC program is a mess, is a can ofworms.This program is out of hand. It Is ac-compllshlnglittlewhileexperiencingdramatic Increases In the number ofrecipients and the costs incurred by theFederal, States, and local governments.I Would repeat what the chairman hassaid. I do not believe there Is a single In-dividual In this House who would defendthe continuation of the program as It Is April 15, 1970nowconstituted. I do dot believe thereIs a soul who would defend the statusquo.Those who oppose this bill certainlyare not doing so on the theory that whatwe have Is sound, that we need not beconcerned about the present program,that we should not adopt this legislationbecause what we have is appropriate,also let us recognize that we are going tobe able to find questions and to be con-cerned about any new approach. I wasconcerned from the beginning. I amstifi concerned about the need to makethis program work.But my first concern prescinds frommy knowledge that the present systemwill not work, because it does not reflectthe philosophy that people should betransferred from the welfare rolls to theemployment rolls and that individual ef-forts to achieve self-sufficiency, should bea prerequlsiteto assistance.What is the underlying philosophy ofthe present AFDC program? It Is sim-ply a guaranteed annual income. TheStates simply establish need levels forvarious family sizes and pay each f am-Ily a cash payment equal to all or partof its needs. These payments, which to-day range from a low of $828 to a highof $4,164 annually for a family of four,are made with little or no regard for theefforts of the adult family members toachieve self-sufficiency through work ortraining.This, Mr. Chairman, is a guaranteedannual Income. The amount of theguarantee varies from State to State inaccordance with the standards they haveestablished. Let me give you some exam-ples to illustrate the level of the presentIncome we are guaranteeing. A familyof four presently receives a guaranteedannual income of $2,220 In Alaska, $2,124In Arizona, $2,292 in Colorado, $3,684 InMassachusetts, $3,468 in Minnesota, and$2,376 In my own State of Wisconsin.We have all of the States listed, andthis Is available to the Members. Thatis the level of guaranteed income thatwe now have. If the Family AssistanceAct simply extended the guaranteed an-nual income to more people, we wouldnot be making any progress at all, andI would be unalterably opposed to thebill, Instead we are converting the pre-sent guaranteed annual income our wel-fare program provides to a system thatcondition assistance on individual effortsto work and take training.This is an entirely different proposalfrom the one recommended by the com-mission that Mr. LANDRUM referred to.He was the gentleman who said that acommission under the last administra-tion made a proposal that was the genesisof this bill. Were there any conditionsImposed on the cash assistance providedunder that proposal. Absolutely not.There was no condition that able-bodiedadults had to take'tralnlng or go to work.The basic concept involved a guaranteedincome whereby frhe Government wouldmake -up the difference- between thefamilies Income and their needs over agiven period of time.Our program Is fundamentally dif-ferent from both that proposal and ex-isting law. Under this program we areCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014HOUSEno' longer going to have a guaranteedannual income. Under this bill, society'sassistance will be conditioned on thehead of a family doing everything tohelp himself and his family that he Iscapable of doing. He must take train-ing; get a job, and go to work.If we are going to be honest withourselves and with. the public, we shouldstop talking about this bill making aradical change by introducing a guar-,anteed annual income. People who favora guaranteed annual income may thinkthe work requirements in this bill are astep backwards, and we have heard thisposition argued. The work and trainingrequirements, which form the backboneof this legislation, are the big difference.Let me say to you if this bill wereonly for the purpose of paying moremoney to more people, I would be up hereopposing It with as much sincerity as Icome here to support it today. But thatIs not the philosophy of this bill. Thephilosophy of this bill is to get peopleoff the treadmill of welfare\u2014dependencyupon a government check\u2014and enablethem to become sell-sufficient partici-pants in the American economic system.Nearly everyone from whom I haveheard during our consideration of thisbill has agreed that we should put theemphasis on work. I agree 100 percent.Mr. Chairman, one of the opponents ofthis legislation, in a speech before thisHouse, uttered words that I would adoptas my own. He said:Itisessential that we recognize thatoccupational rehabilitation is the Only cor-rective mutually beneficial solution to theproblem ofable-bodied, needy Americanadults with a work potential, and the con-clusion is\u2014that only a program leading to ajob and self sufficiency can succeed in reduc-ing the welfare burden.Mr. Chairman, that Is the objective ofthis bill. That is where this legislationdiffers from the programs we have today.Mr. Chairman, let me review withthe Members some of my reasoning inbecoming convinced that the present sys-tem is unworkable. The present sys-tem simply keeps people on the welfaretreadmill, receiving welfare checks Intothe second and third generations. In myopinion it is the worst thing in the worldfor a child to grow up in a householdwhere no one gets up and goes to work inthe morning, but just, goes down to a welfare office and picks up a check once a week. That is the poorest exampleyou can establish. The best individualand family, therapy In the world forthese children is to Imbue them with theAmerican philosophy that there is a correlation between Individual effort andeconomic well-being.The CHAIRMAN. The time of thegentleman from Wisconsin has expired.!r. BYRNES of Wisconsin. Mr. Chair-man, I yield myself 10 additional min-utes.The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman fromWisconsin is recognized for 10 addi-tional minutes.Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin. Mr. Chair-man, I became convinced that the con-cept of work is a' fundamental ingredi-ent in welfare reform. The present sys- tem rewards Idleness and penalizes work.If you are in a nonworkins poor tam-H 3089fly, If you do not work, If you do nothave a job, you are eligible for assist-ance In these States\u2014about half ofthem\u2014that cover the unemployed par-ent.But If the family head Is working,then the family Is not eligible for bene-fits In any jurisdiction, even though thefamily income is below the needs stand-ard established for welfare in the State.How can you encourage unemployedpeople, to whom you are paying assist-ance, to go to work If you are going topenalize them by making them ineligiblfor assistance when they do go to work?If you want to move people from thenonworking poor Into employment, youhave to provide them with assistance oryour attempts will be futile.The present program keeps an individ-ual and his family welfare as long asthey are unemployed. But If they get upIn the morning, go through the extraexpense of working and come home tiredat night, they are no longer eligible forassistance. They are no longer nonwork-ing poor individuals, they are earningsomething, and the present law says weare not going to take care of them.Now that Issue\u2014providing coveragefor the working poor\u2014is the fundamen-tal issue before us today.This is the group of additional in-dividuals we will be providing assistanceto\u2014some 19 mIllion who would be underthe new Program as against 7 millIon in-dividuals who are covered through theaid to families with dependent childrenprogram. This added group is funda-mentally what we call the working poor.Falling tio cover e,working poor re-sults in two inherent detects of the pres-ent system. The first defect Is the incen-tive for family break-up, the fatherleaving the home, If he was the bread-winner there, because his family wouldbe economically better off if he desertedthem and qualified them for assistanceas an AFDC family. The second defectIs the disincentive' to work for those in-tact families where the father Is unem-ployecl\u2014the problem I discussed earlier.Let me just ask why a poor family withminor children should be ineligible forany assistance just because there is aman in the house who Is working? Whyshould that automatically make a familyIneligible for any assistance, even thoughtheir income Is less than the need stand-ard the State has established for AFDCfamilies, to enable them to keep bodyand soul together.Why should work make you ineligiblefor assistance In meeting your needs?We cannot give an answer to that. Noone can give an answer to that.That is why we covered the workingpoor. That Is why I became convincedof the need to cover this group\u2014to dis-courage family disintegration, to fosterfamily stability, and to en\u00f3ourage work.Let me take a simple Illustrative case, using figures from 'a conservatiy a\u00fcdmoderate State, the State of Wis\u00e9onsin.The figures in States like New Jerseywould provide a more compelling cure,becausetheirwelfare payments arehigher, but I am selecting a moderateState' to Illustrate my point.Take a fanlily in the State of Wiscon-sin, with the male In the home working H 3090at $1.50 an hour. He has a wife andthree children. His gross Income at $1.50an hour on a monthly basis is $260. Ifyou deduct from these earnings his workexpenses\u2014such as transportation costs,social security tax, and special clothesthat he has to have, all of which are esti-mated by the Department of Labor to beabout $60 a month\u2014he will have a netincome of $200 a month for himself, his1fe, and his three children. He Is noteligible for any assistance under the aidto 'families with dependent children pro-gram.But the AFDC family consisting of amother and three children would get$189 a month from welfare under theWisconsin program of aid to familieswith dependent children. This is prac-tically as much as the family with theemployed male gets in net income atthe end of the month. Yet, the familywith the mother and three children, re-ceiving $189, has one less mouth to feed,one less person to shelter, and one lessperson to clothe. Economically, they arebetter off?The family with the employed malewould be ahead economically, if the f a-ther left and qualified them for AFDC.This Is the family breakup incentivethe present program provides. There Isan economic inducement for the fatherto leave. Certainly this is not the onlyreason for family breakups, but we areon unsound ground to continue a pro-gram which provides an economic Incen-tive to the breadwinner to leave home,creating a fatherless household with noone working.If we take the case of an individualwith a wife and three children who Isworking at below the minimum wage\u2014and there are betseen 6 and 7 mIllionIndividuals working full time at belowthe minimum wage in this country\u2014theIncentive for family breakup Is evengreater. A man earning $1.25 per hourwould have gross monthly wages of $215,and an economic Income, after deductingwork expenses, of $155 a month. He isnot eligible for assistance because wedo not cover the working poor. In thisparticular case the family is $48 betteroff if he leaves home, and there Is stifione mouth less to feed, one person lessto clothe, and one person less to shelter.Can we continue a program that hasthese kinds of results? I do not'think wecan.Let me give you some figures as towhat an individual must earn in variousStates in order for his family of four tobe as well off as a family of four on wel-fare.In flhinois he must be earning $1.85 anhour for his family of four to be betteroff than a family of four on welfare. InMassachusetts,itis$2.16;Michigan, $1.95. In Wisconsin, as I Indicated, It is$1.50. This is the encouragement we pro-vide today for family disintegration. Andthese are the disincentives we providefor work. We must cover the workingpoor if we are going to avoid this.Let me give you another case in myown State, and this could occur in abouthalf of the States. Consider that intactfamily, which we have already discussed,with the father earning, after work ex-penses, $200 a month. The family is noteligible for assistance because the fatherIs working. Then consider another fam-ily of four, with the father unemployed.Yet because he Is not working, he be-comes eligible immediately for'a familybenefit, In the State of Wisconsin, of $220.In this case it put $20 into his pocket tobe unemployed.Where is the incentive to work whenwe penalize work in a simple case likethis? As I said, you can make cases insome States with higher welfare stand-ards that involve a greater disincentive towork.Does this system make sense? Ofcourse not. What do we have to do? Ithink we have to adopt the underlyingphilosophy of this bill. We have to coverthe working poor.Additionally, we have to provide in-centive to the individual to work. We dothat In this bill in two ways. First, welet him keep the first $720 he earns an-nually\u2014or $60 per month\u2014without sat-fering a diminution In benefits In orderto cover his work expenses.Second, we let the man keep 50 centsout of every additional dollar he earns,reducing his assistance by only 50 per-cent of his earnings up to the break-evenpoint\u2014$3,920 for a family of four re-ceiving a basic benefit of $1,600. Thisprovides encouragement for him to get ajob and go to work, and to continue work-Ing and improving himself.Mr. DENNIS. Mr. Chairman, will thegentleman yield?Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin. I yield tothe gentleman from Indiana.Mr. DENNIS. Mr. Chairman, this is alittle bit technical business, which thegentleman knows more about than I do,so I hope the gentleman bears with me.But the work incentive Is one of the veryimportant things in this bill.Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin. In myjudgment, it Is very Important.Mr. DENNIS. All right. That comesbasically from the idea that after thisfirst $720, the man Is allowed to keep 50percent of whatever additional he mayearn? Is that correct?Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin. That iscorrect. Yes, a 50-percent income disre-gard Is provided.Mr. DENNIS. Is it correct, accordingto the people In this field, that we haveto have the rate that low at least, thatwe cannot take away from him muchmore than 50 percent and retain anysubstantial incentive?Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin. Let me behonest with the gentleman. I do notknow that we can say with any certaintythat there is anything magic about the50 percent.Mr. DENNIS. At any rate, the gentle-man will agree with that?Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin. There arethose who contend, as we have heard thegentleman from Ohio (Mr. AsHBR00K),that the income diSregard is too low, thatwe do not provide enough incentive, par-ticularly when we calculate the disrerardunder cases that will involve State sup-plementation. If the limitation In thevalue of food stamps with increased in-come is included, the disregard is some-what smaller, or conversely, the \"mar-ginal rate\" Is somewhat higher.Mr. DENNIS. But at any rate, If weApril 15, 1970takeaway more than half of what heearns In addition, this reduces his In-centive to work. We have to agree onBYRNES of Wisconsin. Yes, or ItIncreases his Incentive to become un-employed, if he Is working.Mr. DENNIS. Yes. This is the technicalpart, but Is it not a fact that under theprovisions of the bill where the allotmentfor food stamps and so forth Is affectedand Is reduced by the amount he Is al-lowed to keep, that as a matter of fact,although we talk about 50 percent, weare keeping him from retaining sub-stantlally more than that?Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin. That Iswhy I responded that there are thosewho suggest that the total Incentive maybe lnsucIent. But the incentives pro-vided In the disregard included In thisbill are an improvement over existinglaw, so that the bill Cannot be challengedbecause we have not gone far enough Intaking care of the working poor.Mr. DENNIS. Mr. Chairman, will thegentleman yield furt1er?Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin. I yield tothe gentleman from Indiana.Mr. DENNIS. Mr. Chairman, is It truethat actually the rate gets up In the sev-enties and above rather than in the fiftIeswhen we calculate the food stamp al-lowance?Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin. There arecases where that wIll be true, but againwe cannot generalize because in the firstplace food stamps are not available Inall areas. For Instance, I have manycounties In my congressional district thatdo npt have food stamps. I do not knowif or when they will have them, but notevery area has food stamps. We cannotfault this legislation because of pro-visions that are In the Food Stamp Act.Mr. DENNIS. But we have to considereverything together to find out what weare talking about taking away from tineman and what our taxes come to.Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin. I will agreethere are cases where the marginal rateIs above 7) percent, but for most Incomelevels it Is substantially below that. Wemust compare that with the greaterdisincentives found In present law.Mr. DENNIS. But the gentleman Ismore than doubling the welfare rolls, tobegin with. His hope of a future reduc-tion\u2014that Is all it can be now, a hope\u2014depends on this Incentive. I am suggest-ing to the gentleman, If the incentive IsIn fact much less than we generally con-tend, the hope decreases materially.I believe It is fair to point out thatcertain knowledgeable people, such asProfessor Friedman, testifiedto that effect before the committee.Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin. ProfessorFriedman did feel that we were takingaway too much of the Individual's earn-ings that we had not made the disregardhigh enough when we included foodstamps and other factors.What is done by thIs Is to fault thebifi on the basis that we are not spendingmore money than Is proposed under thisbill, that we are not enlarging it beyondwhat the bill calls for, that we are notdoing more for the working poor thanwhat we have done In this bill. But someIndividuals are contending we should notCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSE April .15, 1970evencover the working poor. We mustdo this, It seems to me, If we are to getrid of the underlying concept of thepresent program and implement thephilosophy that people should go to work.That is the only argument I can makein favor of the incentive we have here,that it is much more than we have today.Mr. McCLORY. Mr. Chairman, willthe gentleman yield?Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin. I yield tothe gentleman from flhinois.Mr. McCLORY, I thank the gentlemanfor yielding.I want to compliment the gentleman onthis very clear statement and the descrip-tion of this legislation. I agree generallywith the philosophy in the bill.There is one question I have. In con-nection with the inducements to secureemployment and to receive training foremployment I question the provisionwith regard to the exemption of womenwho have children under 6 years of age.I wonder whether it is not possible thata woman might continue to have childrenone after another so that she would haveone or more children under 6 years ofage for an extended period of time, andthus defeat this inducement we are try-ing to develop through this legislation.Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin. I doubtthat we will find many people who willthink they can come out ahead at theend of the year on a basis of a $300 bonus,if that Is what one wants to call it, foran additional child.We have had a lot of correspondencerecently saying that a $600 deduction Inthe income tax was not enough to takecare of the cost of a child and that wewere not making the proper allowance.So in the last tax bill we did try to moveIn the direction of an Improvement Inthat situation.I do not believe we will find that any-one is going to look at it as an economicincentive to have more children to getthe amount of the allowance we provideIn this bill for each Individual child.The CHAIRMAN. The time yieldedby the gentleman from Wisconsin hasexpired.The Chair advises the gentleman fromWisconsin that he has consumed 40minutes.Mr. MILLS. Mr. Chairman, I hopebefore he concludes the gentleman willallude to one matter In the bill I didnot refer to; that is, these special worksprojects we have Included in the bill forthe purpose of seeing that people whodo not find jobs in regular employmentmay have the opportunity to get workin those projects.The CHAIRMAN. Does the gentlemanfrom Arkansas yield time to the gentle-man from Wisconsin?Mr. MILLS. I will yield time to thegentleman, Mr. Chairman.Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin. Mr. Chair-man, I yield myself 5 additional minutes.The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman fromWisconsin is recognized for an additional5 minutes.I dwelt on the work Incentives becausethis is tied in to the fact that you cannotjust deal with the problem of the non-working poor. If you are going.- to moveIn the direction of getting people to work,CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014HOUSEto become self-sufficient, you cannot thenturn your back on them as soon as theybecome working poor. That is why wehave this Incentive and this -encourage-ment to work built into the bill.Let me point out another Importantprovision in this bill that is not In pres-ent law. Under present law we requirethe States to refer \"appropriate indi-viduals\" to the employment service forwork training and work. Who makesthat determinations? The social worker,the welfare Worker. What has been theresult? It has varied all over the lot be-tween States, but in too many cases thesocial worker has decided that it was notappropriate, for a mother with childrento work. Not only have they said, Iwould say to my good friend from Illi-nois, that itis not appropriate for awoman with preschool children to work,but they say it Is not appropriate for anywoman with children to work.We do not use the word \"appropriate\"In this bill to determine who shall be re-ferred for work and training. We sayeveryone shall be required to registerand take training and work, with a fewexceptions specifically written into thelaw\u2014such as mothers with children un-der 6 and the disabled. But even in thecase of the disabled we require them toregister with the rehabilitation agency tosee If their disability can be corrected.We encourage mothers of preschoolchildren to volunteer and provide themwith child care. We direct the employ-ment service and the Department of La-bor to train these people and to givethem equal opportunities even thoughtheir participation Is voluntary.By spelling outS the exceptions in thestatute we do not leave to the discre-tion of some welfare worker whether anindividual should be referred to workand training. The emphasis In this bill is on employment, so we charge theemployment service with this responsi-bility under carefully specified condi-tions. The responsibility Is with our prin-cipal manpower and employment agen- cy\u2014right where It belongs.Mr. CLEVELAND. Mr. Chairman, willthe gentleman yield?Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin. I yield tothe gentleman.Mr. CLEVELAND. I thank the gentle-man for yielding. I have some questionsconcerning this legislation. I have beentold the only pilot project which has beenconducted for precisely this type of pro-gram for workers on welfare Is one InNew Jersey. I understami It was carriedon under the auspices of the Office ofEconomic Opportunity. I was further In-formed It was based on an enrollment of80 to 90 families and 'that only 1 year of the project was considered, and it hadanother 2 years to go. Is that rathersketchy information correct?Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin. Not en-tirely. I do not recognize the figures you refer to as being those associated withthat study. We can make available tothe gentleman the conclusions of thisstudy, because we did call in the groupthat conducted the study, and they aredeveloping further Information now.But this study was not concerned withwelfare cases. It had to do with the per-113091son who iscurrentlyworking,and whether a supplement to these familieswould discourage them from working andImproving themselves. Their conclusionwas that there was an incentive to workeven though there was some assistancebeing given to this Individual,Mr. CLEVELAND. Am I right that thiswas a New Jersey study under the aus-pi\u00e1es of the Office of Economic Oppor-tunity?Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin. The Officeof Economic Opportunity participated init and the overall contract was undertheir auspices.Mr. CLEVELAND. Mr. Chairman, ifthe gentleman will yield further, am Icorrectly advised that the study has notbeen fully completed?Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin. Oh, no, ithas not been fully completed, but It hasgone to the point that they were able todraw conclusions.Mr. COLLIER. Mr. Chairman, will thegentleman yield to me at that point?Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin. I yield tothe gentleman from Illinois.Mr. COLLIER. I would like to addsomething to that. The idea of providingincentive and encouraging people to workIs not new. This Is not a new program.For years out in my State where generalwelfare assistance and welfare programswere conducted by the various townshipsupervisors and administrators of gen-eral assistance, this was a common prac-tice. I happened to have served in thatcapacity for 4 years In a township. Itwas not unusual at all to help a lowerincome family by getting them either apart-time job or by getting them training,whether It was t\u00e7 work in a local gas sta-tion or what not. It worked, I can tellyou that. It worked In more than onetown. This is not a new concept. It Is justas basic as apple le.Mr. CLEVELAND. Mr. Chairman, willthe gentleman yield further,Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin. Yes, I yieldfurther to the gentleman.Mr. CLEVELAND. I do not wish to getInto a debate on this precise point. But Ihave had experiences with the earninglimitation on social security. I knowabout that and I hope to goodness thatthe members of the Committee on Waysand Means know that many people whenthey get up to the earnings limitation,they stop work even if they could still, get$1 out of every $2 earned after thatlimitation.Another question; what would be thechance of a college student who Is mar-ried and, perhaps, has one or two chil-dren, with no earnings income or noassets? Would he or would he not qualifyas one of the families under this pro-gram?Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin. The indi-vidual, If my memory serves me correctly,and correct me If I am wrong here\u2014would probably be eligible on the basisthat he was the head of a householdtaking training.Mr. CLEVELAND. And this would beso regardless of wheth\u20ac- father wasa millionaire or not? In uther words,- doyou go Into the family background tosee If there is sufficient Income to takecare of this particular Situation? Do you H 3092stop right there with the new young fam-ily itself?Mr. BYRNES of -Wisconsin. We do notImpose a father's responsibility for anadult child. But we do have a minorchild provision. In fact, there Is a newprovision In this bill. To the degree thatthat the Federal Government Is payingfamily assistance to any child or the wifeof an Individual, he now has a financialliability to the Federal Government forthe amount that has been paid by theFederal Government to support his fam-ily.1 assume thisis an independenthousehold with, perhaps, a child. Wewould look into that individual's re-sources.Mr. CLEVELAND. I am talking aboutthe family case where the college stu-dent is married and has a couple of chil-dren and maybe is In postgraduate schoolbecause his family has been able to ar-range for him to continue education,start a family, and stay out of the draftbyprovidingpostgraduatetraining. There he sits as an independent family.I am wondering whether he is entitledto these benefits or not.Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin. The clues-tion Is, are the resources of this parentavailable to this child. If they are, thenthis child will not be eligible.Mr. MILLS. Mr. Chairman, would thegentleman yield?Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin. I yield tothe distinguished Chairman.Mr. MULS. Mr. Chairman, on thepoint raised by the gentleman fromNew Hampshire (Mr. CLEVELAND), firstof all I wouldto the gentleman fromWisconsin (Mr. BYRNES), that we mustbear in mind that the individual was re-quired to make himself available throughthe employment office, to call there for ajob. Of course, he most likely would notbe in need of any training, and if theyfound a job for him he would have totake that jab. if he could not earnenough to bring his income up to thestandard he might get some supplement-ation but in that particular case I donot think there is any real possibilitythat he would be eligible for benefits.Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin. I do notthink a graduate student would be cov-ered, but the Individual who is still anundergraduate might be, because hemight be considered in training.Mr. CLEVELAND. And would It betrue for a technical or vocational schoolor how about college or an engineeringschool?Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin. If It Is con-sidered to be part of the appropriatetraining for this Individual.Mr. MILLS. That is right.Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin. For work.Mr. CLEVELAND. That is why peoplewant to go to college, and why we wanteverybody to go to college, to get an edu-cation and prepare for work.Another question; how about a coupleon social security, and they adopt agrandchild or even have had a child?Would they be eligible for relief underthis?The CHAIRMAN. The time of the gen-tleman has again expired.Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin. Mr. Chair-man, I yield myself 5 additIonal m1nute.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEMr. Chairman, in reply to the gen-tleman from New Hampshire, I thinkthat they could be.Mr. CLEVELAND. My reading of thebill,which I admit Is somewhat cur-sory, leads me to believe they might be,because if the peraon were in need andhad a dependent In the family under 21years of age, and that would be theadopted person or child I am referringto, they would be eligible.Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin. I thinkthe gentleman Iscorrect. Of course,their social security Income would re-duce their family assistance benefit dol-lar for dollar, as there Is no Incomedisregard applicable to unearned income.The registration and work requirementswould a]so be applicable to this individ-ual unless he was unable to engage inwork by reason of his advanced age.Mr. MILLS. Mr. Chairman, if the gen-tleman will yield further, even thougha person may be in training he cannotprescribe his own type of training andthen run down to the welfare office, andsay \"I am in training, so send me acheck.\" He must undertake that courseof training prescribed by the employ-ment office. The employment office mustsay to the fellow that as part of the train-ing we think appropriate for him he isgoing to the vocational school. If he doesnot go, then he would not be eligible.Mr. CLEVELAND.Continuingthe suggestion that the chairman has givenus, if we take this young married per-son, if he has two children and a wife,and he goes down to the employmentoffice, and if he tells the employment of-fice \"I might be. able to go to college ifI can get a little help for the family,\"are you telling me -the employment of-fice would not approve that, as going in-to training?Mr. MILLS. Ido not know what theywould do because It is not intended tosupply money for those in school. Let usget that point clear. But It might be thatthe employment office would decide thatIn order to train a person who Is alreadyon AFDC that It would be necessary forthem to at least complete another yearof school, but this program is not in-tended to apply to people going to col-lege, whatsoever.Mr. GROSS. Mr. Chairman, will thegentleman yield?Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin. I yield tothe gentleman from Iowa.Mr. GROSS. The gentleman says thishas no application to a person to go tocollege?Mr. MILLS. That is right.Mr. GROSS. No application whateverto the person under this program?Mr. MILLS. They are not availablefor full-time work in the first place.Mr. GIBBONS. Mr. Chairman, willthe gentleman yield?My BYRNES of Wisconsin. I yield tothe gentleman from Florida.Mr. GIBBONS. Mr. Chairman, I wouldlike to point out in regard to the ques-tion raised by the gentleman from NewHampshire that you Just cannot do itunder this program, there is not enoughmoney in this whole project. We are talk-ing about 80 cents a day to feed a child.You are not going to be able to feedApril 15,1970one for that price unless you are willingto do something else to earn Income. Andwe are only talking about for adults alittle more than that per day, so thereIs just not enough money In the wholeprogram to do the kind of things thegentleman is pointing out even if It werelegally possible.Mr. LATI'A. Mr. Chairman, will thegentleman yield?Mr. I yield tothe gentleman from Ohio.Mr. LATI'A. To me, the gentleman'sargument on this bill is based on thefact that you are attempting to keep thefather In the home and keep the familytogether so that he does not have toabsent himself from the family In orderfor them to get some relief. Is that notone of the purposes of the bill?Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin. That isone of the problems encouraged by thepresent law and this bill attempts tocorrect It.Mr. LATI'A. Let me give you a hypo-thetical situation under this bill and seewhether or not by splitting up a familyof a husband and wife and four children,the way this bill Is now written, youwould not come up with more money.Take a family of a husband, wife, andfour children. Under the terms of thisbill, they would get $2,200. It would beeasy to figure under the composition ofa family as set forth on page 11 and 12.If you are really looking out for dollarsand cents, which you are trying to getaway from through the present systen,under the provision of this billthe father could talce two children and themother could take two children and eachset up a home and so get $2,600 as op-posed to $2,200.Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin. As a mat-ter of economics, If you get down to theprecise figures there are additional costsinsetting up a completely separatehousehold rather than staying in onehousehold. I do not think you have avery good case when you consider theadditional cost they are going to Incur.Mr. LA'YrA. That Isthesame argu-ment, however, that the gentleman isusing and that the proponents of thisbill are using against the present welfaresystem, where the husband would stayaway from his home State. or go to an-other place to live and go where hecould get more money But now you aresaying you cannot use those same argu-ments against this situation. I wouldsuggest to the gentleman to clear up thelanguage of this bill and prevent thissituation from happening when It goesto conference.Mr. MILLS. Mr. Chairman, will thegentleman yield?Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin. I yield tothe gentleman.Mr. MILLS. The gentleman from Ohioin the Committee on Rules raised thequestion about the language of the bill,As I said in my opening remarks, I amcertainly not going to contend that everyword in this bill Is perfect. But I do notsee, if we made even one mistake or twoIn the bill, that that Is any excuse forkilling the whole- theory of the redirec-tion of this program.Actually, I do not think we have made April 15,1970CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014 HOUSE 113093all these mistakes. But, if we have, thislegislation will be amended just as allother legislation is amended.In the instance that the gentlemanmentions where the father is In thehousehold, he would have to register forwork and en.ployment. Whereas now boththe father and the mother would have todo that.Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin. -Addition-ally, the father would have a liability toUncle Sam for the amount of Federalfunds paid to his wife and child as aresult of the father leaving them. I doubtthat he would find this would be a veryadvantageous situation.Mr. LATTA. Is the gentleman inferringthat there is no now?Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin. There isno Federal liability.Mr. LATTA. I know that. But howabout State liability?Mr. BYEtNES of Wisconsin. There Isto the extent the State enforces It. Butnow we make it a Federal responsibility.We do this to make sure that there Isproper enforcement and also to assist inthe problem that occurs when a fatherabsents himself from the State and Itbecomes difficult for the local authoritiesto trace him Into another State. This isnew under this legislation\u2014the lmpos-tion of the Federal responsibility.Mr. LATI'A. If the gentleman will yieldfor just one further question\u2014as hasbeen pointed out by the gentleman fromArkansas and the gentleman from Wis-consin, that this not only requires thehusband to go out and seek employmentbut also puts the responsibility on themother In the case where she has chil-dren above the age of 6.Mr. BYRNS of Wisconsin. Right.Mr. LATIA. As I pointed out beforethe Committee on Rules, as the gen-tleman remembers, I am very much op-posed to this because I think a mother'splace Is In the home when they havechildren 6 and 7 years of age.Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin. Well, youdiffer with the gentleman from Illinoiswho Is criticising the bill because wedo not make the mother with childrenunder 6 register. That shows the diffi-culty we have In trying to reach a happymedium.Mr. LATFA. My friend, the gentlemanfrom Illinois, does not cast my vote nordoes he think for me.Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin. I knowthat.Mr. LATTA. But I am stressing thefact, and I am hoping your great com-mittee, when you get this matter Intoconference will give a little thoughtabout keeping the mother In the home,as well as the father. -Mr.BYRNES of Wisconsin.think It Is most Important to. respond- to that.First, If there are no children under 6 Itmeans that the children are In schoolduring the daytime. The mother In thiscase does not have to be there duringthe daytime to take care of these chil-dren. Why should she not be at work.Second, It' seems to me the greatesttherapy for these kids Is to lave themsee somebody get up In the morningand go to work' and not just grOw up Ina family that has had to rely on a wel-fare check. So as far as my particularviewpoint is concerned, I see nothingwrong at all in requiring mothers withchildren who are over 6 years old toregister to take training and to takework. That is why I disagree with thegentleman.I must yield the floor at this time.-Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentle-man from Virginia (Mr. BROYBILL) suchtime as he may require.(Mr. BROYHILL of Virginia askedand given permission to revise andextend his remarks.)Mr. BROYHILL ofVirginia.Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 16311because I believe It is a move in theright direction.If there appears to be a suggestion ofsome hesitancy in my voice, there is. Butthe engulfing welfare mess we are nowin has convinced us all that the pres-ent welfare system has failed. While Ido not have the confidence that the fam-ily assistance plan will lead us quicklyfrom our dilemma, It is a new approach,a new hope, that can lead those caughtIn welfare and the poverty cycle to thegreener pasture of seif-suliiciency andoff welfare rolls onto tax rolls.For those who are concerned, as I am,about guaranteed annual wage, the fain-fly assistance plan is not that. It addsto the current \"guaranteed Income,\" Ifyou will, of present welfare handouts,the condition that qualified ablebod.Iedmembers register\u2014take -training\u2014andget to work or improve themselves for abetter job. By contrast, the HelnemanCommission report contains no such con-dition to its income maintenance pay-ments.I am convinced that too long we haveheard the voice of the social theoristsoverpersuadingpovertylevelpersons that they have a right to welfare, thatthe almighty Government owes them aliving whether they work or not. I amagainst force that destroys human dig-nity as much as the social theorists. Butstudies now bear me out that this cod-dling attitude has been wrong all along.If we listen to the mothers on welfareand to the majority in the poverty cycle,they want to work, If they can have somehelp on child-care needs and training.Even In this bill, mothers with chil-dren under age 6. are exempt from theregistration requirement, though suchpersons may voluntarily register andenter a training program, utilizing d\u00e0y-care assistance.How many of us know families in the.middle income, and even affluent group,who have working parents, with chil-dren under age 6 at home or In specialfacilities? Why must we continue to forcea coddling attitude on those on welfare,when. they prefer to respond to oppor-'tunity. A survey in Nb'W York City amongwelfare mothers showed -that six out of10, who had children under age 6, saidthey would prefer. to work if they hadchild-care help.We need to get rid of the overkill ap-proach to welfare. Even in the family as-sistance plan there Is this lurking ele-ment in the day-care plan. Federalfunds will provide 100 percent of therehabilitation ad renovation of the prO-posed day-care centers. The emphasis Inmeeting the day-care needs appears tobe directed toward elaborate centerswithspeciallyqualifiedprofessional persons.But it does not require a genius to takecare of a child. One study showed thatretarded children reared by women withIQ of less than 80, became productiveworkers, while a controlled group of--sim-ilar retarded children left behind inthe care of an institution never becameproductive in their lifetime.Without denying the value and needof such day-care centers, It is my ap-prehension that the emphasis of theadministrativeprofessionalsisto go heavy In this direction. This is despitethe fact a majority of welfare and work-ing mothers would prefer to make theirown child-care arrangements, either witha relative or neighbor, rather than trans..port their child to a more distant elab-orate center. The working families wholive In your neighborhood and my neigh-borhood do not have a day-care super-visor for their children with a master'sdegree.What the poverty families want is notoverkill. They are not demanding a Cad-illac, but they could use a compact. Theywant basic help, opportunity for train-ing for a job that exists after taking thatopportunity, and some financial helpwith day care while taking that trainingand working.I also am concerned that disappoint-ment may set In when it Is realized thatthe task of providing training for jobsthat exist cannot be met overnight forall those for whom this program Is In-tended to serve. We are taking a bigbite that .will take us longer than wethink to digest.But I do like the more positive ap-proach to this program. It has beenshown that rising economy itself re-duces gradually the number of personsIn the poverty levels of income, yet ourwelfare rolls have Increased with thisburdgeoning economy.I am glad that this plan recognizesthe working poor\u2014the folks who havebeen wearing the white hats. It is timethat we give a helping hand to thosewho have not shirked in their effort tobreak out of the poverty cycle,, despitethe present incentive to join their moreaffluent neighbors on welfare.It Is a program designed to help fam-ilies stay together.It establishes Federal standards to re-duce the flow of welfare-oriented fam-ilies to the urban areas.It seeks to do something about hold-ing deserting fathers\u2014and mothers\u2014fl-n\u00e1nclally responsible for their families.It raises the level of adult assistancefor the aged, blind, and disabled to $110a month.It brings a measure of financial reliefto the States.'And, Importantly, It places a lid onthe cellingless Federal payments thathave been growing by leaps and boundsfor aldto families of dependent children.Mr. Chairman, I -recommend the bill.Mr. MILLB. Mr. Chairman, I yieldsuch time as he may consume to the gen-tieman from New York' (Mr GItBERT).(Mr. GILBERT asked and was given 113094permissiontoievise and extend hisremarks.)Mr. GILBERT. Mr. Chairman, I risein full and complete support of the Fain-ily Assistance Act of 1970. As a memberof the Committee on Ways and Meanswho helped formulate the bill beforeus today, I commend my chairman (Mr.MILLS), as well as the ranking minoritymember (Mr. BYRNES). I believe the billas it is before us today represents a sub-stantial improvement in the proposalsubmitted by President Nixon to Congresslast year.The bill offers a meaningful step for-ward toward easing the burdens of wel-fare in this Nation, not only for thosewho desperately need assistance but forthose citizens who must pay the bill.I commend the committee particularlyfor important improvements in categoriesrelating to assistance for the aged, theill, the handicapped, and the blind.Mr. Chairman, none of us are evercompletely satisfied with a bill when itleaves thernittee, and this bill, nomatter how revchitionary, is no excep-tion. I, among others, strongly urged thecommittee to raise the minimum levelsper family. I believe the proposed allot-ments now in the bill of $500 for the firsttwo members of a family and $300 foreach additional member, are simply notadequate to provide a satisfactory base.I would hcpe that once this programis implemented, It will become clear tothe administration that minimum levelsmust be raised In the next fiscal budget.Nevertheless, I view the bill in Its presentform as an Important first step that mustbe taken and I am hopeful that a maj-ority of the House will so agree.This bill Is, of course, as controversialas any that will come before this bodythis year. But let me discuss briefly justseveral of the provisions In the bill that,to me, make Its passage essential.The bill will extend family assistancecoverage from 7 million persons to 20million Americans. And in the criticalarea of programs for the aged, the blind,and the handicapped, coverage will beextended from 3 mIllion to 4 mIllionpersons.And for the first time, our social wel-fare program will encourage, rather thandiscourage, a male head of household toremain in the home and help provideneeded balance to his family.For the first time, welfare is recog-nized as a national rather than a localproblem. This bill will not only ease theoverwhelming financial burden on localgovernments, It will at last put an endto the need for the heartbreaking migra-tion of untrained rural citizens to ourNation's cities.Mr. Chairman, my own city of NewYork has long carried out the most liberalof family assistance programs. And asthe costs grew ever more awesome, at-tempts were made periodically to \"weedout\" the sb-called welfare cheats. But,even though there have been some spec-tacular exceptions, the general conclu-sions of these investigations proved sim-ply that a great many people had validcause to be on welfare rolls.The Inescapable fact is that a greatmany of our citizens do need assistanceif they are to survive. I believe it is theCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEresponsibility of Government to offerthat assistance until such time as theycan be helped to become self-supportingcitizens once again.If I may, Mr. Chairman, let me closewith these simple thoughts. Our Nationis one of wealth and abundance. In lessthan 200 years we have fashioned themost progressive, forward-looking Na-tion ever to exist. We believe devoutly infundamental freedoms, in justice, equal-ity, and opportunity. We have sharedour riches with many nations; indeed, wehave often been more generous abroadthan we have at home. Let us now usepart of our resources to help our ownpeople. I believe It is an investment thisNation will look back on with pride, forafter all, It is an Investment In our ownfuture.Mr. MILLS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 15minutes to the gentleman from Oregon(Mr. ULLMAN).Mr. ULLMAN. Mr. Chairman, It grievesme to find myself in opposition to mychairman and my friend from Wisconsin.The chairman was reminiscing to me theother day about the two greatest mis-takes he made since he was in the Con-gress, and I would say to the chairmanthat, compared to what you are doing to-day, those others will fade into insignifi-cance.Mr. MILLS. Mr. Chairman, will thegentleman yield?Mr. ULLMAN. I yield to the distin-guished chairman.Mr. MILLS. I have been praying theLord that he will deliver me from all ofthese many mistakes I have made.Mr. T.JLLMAN. I am hopeful, too, Mr.Chairman.The chairman very eloquently pointedout the deficiencies of the present wel-fare system, and I think most of us wouldcOncur. But I would say you do not haveto adopt this remedy to cure the deficien-cies that he pointed out. For example, theproblem of the family breakup. All itwould take would be a simple Federalstandard requiring unemployed fathersto be covered In all States. Obviouslythat would cure that problem.With respect to the problem of theWIN program referrals, all we wouldhave to require here is the Federal stand-ard making it mandatory to refer whom-ever we saw fit to the employment agen-cies. But at any rate, the big problemwe have here today is trying to under-stand a complex piece of legislation. Ihope this Committee will not, just be-cause there are deficiencies in the presentprogram, go headlong into a new pro-gram that is so totall untried and sofull of pitfalls that I will attempt to out-line very briefly here today.Mr. Chairman, today we are consider-ing one of the most' far-reaching piecesof legislation to come before Congress Inrecent years.Passage of this welfare reform billwould mark a turning point in Americansocial and economic history. The FederalGovernment would embrace the philos-ophy that American citizens are entitledto a guaranteed annual income. It is truethat we limit that guarantee to thosewith limited assets, those with familiesand those who register at the employ-ment office. -But within those limitationsApril 15,1970the taxpayers of the Nation will becharged with permanent income mainte-nance for all.Because I disagree with this basic con-cept as well as many spc1fic provisionsof the bill, I oppose its passage. I am not,however, an opponent of welfare reform.In my judgment, it is possible to devise aneffective Federal program that will bringmeaningful help to the poor. It Is not,however, possible through this bill. I havegreat compassion for the poor. I believethat we can eliminate poverty and thatshould be one objective.The action of this bill is to dispensecash. There is a great deal of talk aboutwork incentives. But the bill offers littlethat is new in the employment area ex-cept the basic proposition that everybodyon welfare who is eligible to work mustregister to work. Once registered, thepoor will face most of the same frustra-tions and disillusionments they now en-counter under the present welfare-worksystem. Few Improvements would be in-stituted. The significant difference is that3 million more heads of families wouldbe registered for the course In frustra-tion and disillusionment.The administration Indicates that lwill provide for an increase In fundingfor job training and child care In thefirst full year of the family assistanceprogram. But the increase Is not enoughto overcome the Inadequacies of the exist-ing programs, much less enough to meetthe demands of a greatly expanded newprogram.Mr. Chairman, we have before us a billwith Imposing consequences and seriousdeficiencies. It deserves the full under-standing and careful consideration of theCongress before action is taken.We cannot afford to say simply: \"Any-thing is better than the present system.\"The stakes are too high.will vote for a straight recommittalof the bill. The committee can produce abill that is responsive to the need, yetpreserves the integrity of the system.I would like to take a few minutes nowto describe some of the questions thatthis bill has raised in my mind duringthe 6 months It has been before the com-mittee. In my judgment, these questionsstill need to be answered.Before us is a complex bifi that over-night would nearly triple the size of theNation's welfare rolls to 25 mifilon anddouble the- Federal cost of welfare tomore than $8 billion a year.The cost of the family assistance pro-gram is to be met by open-ended appro-priation of the Congress from generaltax revenues. The administration saysthe first-year cost of the new program tothe Federal Government will be an added$4.4 billion. The committee proposes leg-islation that on top of total coverage ofthe Federal floor, would commit theFederal Government to pay 30 percentof the supplemental costs of the States,up to the limits of the poverty level.This, of course, Is only a beginning.Ax extra $4 billion for Federal floor bene-fits In the early 1970's wIll easily becomean extra $8 billion by the late 1970's. A30-percent share in supplemental pay-ments will undoubtedly be increased to60 percent or higher within a few years.Congress will face annual presspre until April 15, 1970thetotal cost of the welfare system Isassumed by the Federal GOvernment.This bill goes a long way toward federal-izing the cost of the welfare system. Thefew steps remaining after its passagewould merely be a matter of time.The bill places a Federal floor underthe adult categories in the system\u2014theaged, the blind, and the disabled. Herethere is no controversy. The increases inbenefits that will result from the newfloor are necessary to help those lockedinto a fixed income to meet the erosionsof inflation on their benefit dollar. Thesystem will continue to be operated ina conventional manner by the States.Beneficiaries in these adult categoriescomprise less than 30 percent of the totalnumber of persons receiving welfarechecks. Their number has remainedrelatively level in recent years.In the other major welfare category,family assistance, families are strictlydefined. A minimum family requires twopersons, an adult and a child under 18or if he is a student, under 21. Singlepersons and couples without children arenot eligible under the bill. This provision,incidentally, strikes me as one of thebill's most glaring anomalies. How canone accept the principle of guaranteedincome for families and refuse to do itfor single persons and couples?Aid to families, of course, is the sourceof our mushrooming welfare costs, withthe number of persons enrolled under theexisting program having nearly tripledIn the past decade. Later I will discusehow this total cost will mushroom In thefuture. But cost alone Is not a sufficientreason for opposition.What does this program do? First and,of course, the most important signifi-cant thing that It does, and the thingthat has most of the Members of theCongress greatly concerned, within cer-tain limitations It does prescribe for thefirst time in the history of this countrya guaranteed family Income program. Iam going to cover that In a bit of detaillater on. But we have never had thiskind of family guAranteed income pro-gram under any circumstances In thiscountry before.Second\u2014and I think this is very lxii-portant\u2014the United 8tates under thisprogram does directly assume the fullresponsibility for the welfare program,for determination of basic eligibility forall family welfare recipients.That goes to the determination of in-come, to the determination of assets.The U.S. Government will administerthe means test to the family status, andany other requirements under the pro-gram.In assuming this responsibility theUnited States will be charged with theresponsibility for that welfare determi-nation, the determination of eligibility,as well as making the payments. Thesewelfare payments across the land Inevery community and In every Statewill be paid directly out of the FederalTreasury. This Includes all the 1.7 mIl-lion families now on the AFDC programas well as this broad new designationthat we call the working poor. So thisbill would add 2.9 mIllion new families\u2014and that amounts to 15 millIon new peo-CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014HOUSEpie\u2014to the welfare rolls in this countryon a 100 percent Federal basis.I was horrified in the committee Inlistening to the witnesses from the ad-ministration tell us how this programwill work. I want to say it is an adminis-trative monstrosity, that It does noteliminate any of the bureaucracy, but itjust adds another layer. This, I think, istremendously significant. I had hoped,personally, that when we had a proposalto reform welfare, we would use that op-portunity tO clean up the mess of bu-reaucracy we have operating in thiswhole area of poverty.The Family Assistance Act moves to-ward nationalization of the welfare sys-tem, but it does not simplify the adminis-tration of the system.A new Federal agency will have to beestablished in the Department of Health,Education, and Welfare to administerthe family assistance plan. A whole newbureaucracy would be born.The payment program would operateessentially on a declaration basis. Theprospective beneficiary would declare hisbasis for eligibility under the uniformstandards, and once approved and regis-tered in the employment office, he wouldbegin to receive a benefit check. The dec-laration system is already in use atsome New York City welfare centers, re-placing personal interviews and investi-gation as the basis fot eligibility. It Isviewed by many welfare experts as a major step In the shift from a work-orientedwelfare system to an income mainte-nance system.Spot \u00e0hecklng of a sampling of Initialdeclarations is planned to ensure accu-rate reporting of Income. This Is clearlyan inadequate safeguard against abuseof the system.The Federal Government will have Itshands full coping with the high turnoverof families In need, and the fluctuationof Income In the poverty level. Under theexisting program, In 1988 some eight mu..lion separate persons received welfarechecks, even though the average monthlynumber of recipients in that year wasonly 5.7 millIon. Determining the amountof the monthly check for the workingpoor will be extremely difficult. As oneexpert witness told the committee duringhearings:There Is a very large amount of up anddown In the Income of people In these lowincome levels, and In percentage terms It IsImmense. FIfty percent. 60% varIations arenot at all uncommon.There will be critical administrativeproblems under the work registrationrequirements of the bill, too. The Secre-tary of Labor has the full responsibffltyunder the bill to develop program formanpower services, training, and em-ployment, and Is expected to utilize State employment services In many casesto implement these programs. Accordingto the Secretary of Labor's Own descrip-tion before the 'cothmlttee, his depart-ment would work on a joint basis withState and local agencies to develop man-power and employability plans for re-cipients. The Secretary would get guide-lines for these plans, but actual Imple-mentation, In his words, would go \"officeby office.\" The failure of State agenciesH 3095touseimaginative,innovativeap- proaches In placing welfare beneficiariesin training programs Is a major source ofconcern about the existing system.The food stamp program, which isbilled as an Integral part of PAP's at-tack on poverty, will in fact remain verymuch outside FAP for administrativepurposes, continuing under the directionof the Department of Agriculture. Thecommittee recognizestheInefficiency and potential Ineffectiveness of this divi-sion of the poverty program.Thus, we willkeep much ofthe bureaucratic mess we have. On top of Itwe will add a new layer of Federalbureaucracy operating both in Washing-ton and in hundreds of American cities.Mr. LATrA. Mr. Chairman, will thegentleman yield?Mr. LJILMAN. I the gentlemanfrom Ohio.Mr. LATTA. Mr. Chairman, the gen-tleman had some testimony before hiscommittee on the administration of thisprogram. I just wonder If the gentle-man had any testimony on how much itwill cost to administer this program.Mr. ULMAN. It would be a guess,whatever we said. The administrationhad some figures as to what It wouldcost, but they are not based upon any-thing In the world of reality at all. If weare talking about proper administration,if we are talking about a real determina-tion of assets and not just opening upthe Federal Treasury to everybody whofills out a form, then the administrationcosts would be cozhpletely beyond any-thing that has been proposed by the ad-ministration.Mr. KYL. Mr. Chairman, will the gen-tleman yield?Mr. ULLMAN. I yield to the gentlemanfrom Iowa.Mr. KYL Mr. Chairman, I think thegentleman Is making a fine statement.My major concern about this whole pro-cedure is thIs The first time the mattercame before the Congress which wouldtry to enforce making a person work be-fore she or he could get welfare, I amconvinced tthls body would turn Its backon the philosophy of this program andsay we just cannot force a person to goto work to get welfare, and we would beright back where we were except we willhave the guaranteed annual wage on topof this program.Mr. ULLMAN. I think the gentlemanIs absolutely right.Mr. MILLS. Mr. Chairman, will thegentleman yield?Mr. DILMAN. I yield to the gentlemanfrom Arkansas.Mr. MILLS. Mr. Chairman, do I un-derstand from my friend, the gentlemanfrom Iowa, that he Is disappointed be-cause the bill requires these people totake training, to go to work?Mr. KYL. Mr. Chairman, will the gen-tleman yield?Mr. ULLMAN. I yield to the gentle-man from Iowa.Mr. KYL. Mr. Chairman, what I amsaying Is with the socIs system In theUnited States and with the court systemworking as It is In the United States, noone Is going to force anyone in the finalanalysia to go to work, no matter howlofty or honorable a goal it would be. H 3096Mr. MILLS. The gentleman assures usthat is not the case, that there are 3million, 200 thousand of these peoplewho either possess training or are capa-ble of training and after training go towork. Would the gentleman like to seethem working?Mr. KYL. Mr. Chairman, If the gentle-man will yield further, I would ask thegentleman from Arkansas this question:Did not this Congress a few years agoadopt a policy which would have forcedthe ADC mothers, for instance, to go towork?Mr. MILLS. No, we did not. We putthe onus on the States to see to It thatthey had training.The States decided that none of themwere \"appropriate for training.\" Theygot out of it In practically every State.Now we are taking over the program,and we will have Federal employeesmaking that decision under the Secre-tary of Health, Education, and Welfare.The Secretary of Health, Education, andWelfare must assume the responsibil-ity if the program is not administeredproperly.Mr. T.JLLMAN. Mr. Chairman, let meproceed with an analysis very quickly ofthis work requirement. In my jtdgmentthis Is the most overrated provision Inthis whole bill.The administration has sold the familyassistance plan on the proposition thatits program will achieve this goal. Thefanfare for \"workfare\" raises the ex-pectations of hundreds of thousands ofAmericans that new and better jobs willdevelop under FAP. But the programneither lays the foundation for these jobsnor provides adequate funding for train-ing and child care to make workingfeasible.This is the problem. It takes moneyto train people. There Is not that kindof money in the President's budget, toeven break the surface of the overallproblem.I havC a chart here indicating 1969,1970, 1971, and 1972, indicating what thefunding provisions In the bill are, andat the break what the problem Is. Weare not even beginning to cope with theproblem of training these people. It Isan extremely expensive proposition.When we say we are going to referthem to the Employipent Bureau, the em-ployment agencies will have a hard timejust handling the paperwork of register-ing them. Insofar as the training andwork placement are concerned, I seenothing In the bill that would implementthose programs.The key work program for welfarebeneficiaries now Is the work incentiveprogram\u2014WIN. Authorized In 1967 byCongress, WIN got off to a 40w startbut has gained momentum steadily Inthe recent months. Although there aremany defects In the program, WIN hasits strong supporters. The director ofCalifornia's WIN program, Aaron Levln,who Is a veteran administrator of foursucceeding Federal manpower programs,told the committee that WIN is \"to mehe most heart warming, the most com-prehensive, the most flexible program Ihave ever seen for training and employ-ment of welfare recipients.\"CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSELeylh observed that WIN brings to-gether the three major systems requiredfor a successful program\u2014education, la-bor and welfare. It Is tailored at theState and local level to meet the specialneeds of local and regional problems. Itemploys a unique team approach to solv-ing Individual cases, including coachingby other welfare beneficiaries already en-rolled in the program.An important deficiency in WIN hasbeen the lack of adequate funding forthe program.In fiscal 1969, Federal outlays for WINtotals only $33 million to cover 81,000slots. Budgets for fiscal 1970 and 1971call for sizable Increases but not nearlyenough to meet demand in many areas.For example, New York City has 9,600training slots In fiscal 1970. But officialstold the committee that the need Is for48,000 slots.Nothing like this kind of a quantumjwnp is planned under FAP. WIN Is tobe repealed by PAP, and replaced ap-parently by a program much like it. Theadministration plans In the first full yearto open up 150,000 new training slotsand to provide training to upgrade skillsof 75,000 of the 3 mIllion newly regls'tered working poor at a total cost of $210million. The scope of the proposed pro-gram is clearly inadequate.There are, in fact, a long list of prob-lems with FAP that thust be solved ifwork Incentives are to be anything buthollow rhetoric. These include:First. Transportation. A marked shiftin the makeup of the welfare populationwill occur under PAP from urban torural, largely because of the addition ofthe working poor. Most of the workingpoor live in nonurban areas.Among the existing welfare popula-tion, 73 percent live in urban areas, 27percent in nonurban areas. According toone stvy presented before the commit-tee, the AP population will break downalmost 50-50 between urban and non-urban. Among the nonurban FAP popu-latl\u00f3n, 75 percent will live in towns ofless than 2,500 population.Besides making job training programsmore uneconomical, the shift in the wel-fare population toward nonurban areaspresents a transportation problem. Lackof adequate transportation is already aserious concern under existing programs.In rural areas, enrollees in the WIN pro-gram are stranded miles from programcenters without cars or access to publictransportation facilities.FAP's nonsolution Is a cruel one. Per-sons living In rural areas where privateor public transportation opportunitiesare not available will be required toregister for FAP, but will not be requiredto participate in the program. These peo-ple will not be considered priority casesunder FAP. Government public trans-portation services will receive low-prio-rity attention, Labor Department officialsadmit.Special works projects: This currentprogram could be one of the most fruit.-ful In finding jobs in the public sectorwhen they are not available In privateIndustry. The program would employwelfarerecipientsthroughFederal,State, and local public and nonprofitApril 15, 1970agencies, offering particular usefulness intimes of high unemployment in the pri-vate sector.Adequate financial incentives to par-ticipate In this program have not beenforthcoming, and public agencies havevirtuallyignoredthe program. Onlyabout 765 slots have been activated, with75G In one State, West Virginia. Fund-ing is running below $1 million a year.The committee calls for a renewed em-phasis on this program in its report, andexpresses the hope that there will hence-forth be \"wide implementation of specialwork projects.\"But It should be noted that the admin-istration's original bill barely mentionedspecial projects, and no estimates of fu-ture funding are available. In my judg-ment, there are no grounds for optimismthat this important vehicle for expand-ing employment opportunities for wel-fare workers will be utilized any moreeffectively than it has been in the past.CHILD CAREA critical area if any new welfare pro-gram Is to succeed is child care. FAPwould expand the federally aided day-care program by adding 450,000 morechildren. This is an important step for-ward.But more can and should be done Inchild care. Among the adult family wel-fare population, there are 750,000 womenwith recent full- or part-time work ex-perience. This Labor Department statis-tic suggests the need for at least a fur-ther doubling of day-care slots and fund-ing beypnd the day careand $400 for part-time care fall below the\"acceptable\" level of child care as de-fined by experts before the committee.These unit costs are only marginallyabove the ininlntum level of care, wherethe health and safety of the child arethe primary concerns, and little atten-tion can be given to developmental needs.Many experts in this field observe thatthe disadvantages to children of a mini-mum level of care far outweigh the ad-vantages of having mothers work.Token funds of $24 million would beauthorized in the firstfull yea* forrenovation and remodeling of child-carecenters. No money Is earmarked for con-struction of new day-care facilities. ThisIs considered a serious shortcoming un-der the present program, and will obvi-ously prove more serious under a greatlyexpanded program.Beyond these specific problems, thereare broad defects In the job provisionsof FAP. A basic fault of this entire exer-cise In so-called fundamental welfare re-form is the administration's failure toattempt some streamlining of the myriadnuiner of Federal programs now operat-ing, and daily overlapping, In the man-power development area.The Department of Labor praientedan exhibit to the committee that showedthere are 24 federally assisted manpowernumber of Federal programs now operat-erating\u2014Some under the Labor Depart-ment, others under HEW, Defense, Com-merce, and HtJD.Critics of this bureaucratic nightmare April 15, 1970 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014HOUSEwho appeared before the committeespokeof\"unproductivecompetitionamong manpower programs,\" and \"re-d\u00fcndant calls to personnel managers,\" to_________ mentiononly a couple of comments. 9000 Theprovisions of the FAP program k500 aimed at consolidation amount to fine $8,000 tuning, not major adjustment. In myjudgment, most of the 24 programs $8500 should be consolidated under a singlewelfare-experienced agency.Another major problem area that FAPdoes not, solve is where the new and im- '500 proved jobs will be found at the end of $3,000 the training programs. . study by the Auerbach Corp. of slsoo Philadelphia presented to the committeestressed that \"much more needs to be $500 known about the actual availability\" ofjobs related to Federal manpower pro- 0 grams. The study recommended that ajob analysis, on a site-by-site basis, should be made with particular emphasison the relative potential of the public andprivate sectors of the economy to supplyjobs.A manpower program for the poor hasto be developed around the existing mar-ket, not merely assumptions that jobs willbe available at the end of the trainingprogram. The size of local welfare man-power programs is presently determinedby the size of the welfare population. Asthe Auerbach study rightfully points out;It would make some sense to let theprojectsize be g\u00f3,erned by actual job availability.The study adds:Labor market analysis would also ensurethat training programs were suitable forexisting jobs.There Is no hint that FAP will correctthese errors. There Is only every indica-tion that the program will carry theNation further into the mire by a mas-sive expansion of the work-registrationrolls without any knowledge of the possi-bilities for placement in new or improvedjobs.We have had some talk about thepenalties, that if one does not work hewill lose his welfare payment. What isthe situation? If the family head refusesto work the only penalty here that weImpose upon him is a loss of $300 a yearin the amount of the payment. His wifewould then get $500 and the first childwould get $500, and it would be $300 foreach child beyond that. So the onlypenalty we are imposing for refusing towork is $300 a year.I have, a chart here I will show In amoment which indicates the magnitudeof what we are talking about in terms ofFederal assistance.Let us look very briefly at how thisguaranteed income program works. Iwant to point out, this is sofllethlng new.We have never had it under any guiseas a program In this country.I believe the best way to illustrate howIt would work is to show the Members atable. I am sorry you are not able to readthe numbers. I will insert it in the RECORDfor your study. This Is the kind of tablethat will obviously be available to everyso-called working-poor family in thiscountry. All. one has to do Is to get acopy of It.Let us take a couple of examples. Firstlet us go down to the $720 level. Anyonein the country could earn $720 and stillget 100 percent of family assistance pay-ments under this program. So a familyof two would get $1,300 and a family ofthree $1,600, and on up to a family of10, which would get $4,000 under thisprogram, assuming all they earned was$720. But where it gets more complicatedIs the 2.9 million new families of work-ing poor that we are putting under theprogram. We assume a lot of them havenever been on welfare. But suppose theyare making $2,500 a year and have afamily of six children. You go up thecolumn and you find the Federal Gov-ernment then would start paying them$1,910 every year. They would start get-ting a check for that amount the nextmonth. If you will take a larger family,you could go up to $5,000 In income. Takea family of nine children. The FederalGovernment would pay them $1,560 everyyear. They would start getting that checkthe next month. Of course, this assumesthe means test will be passed, which Is$1,500 in assets. Remember, though, thatthe home is exempt and whatever assetsare required to hold down a job. Presum-ably an automobile that would be usedto travel back and forth to the job wouldbe also exempt.The CHAIRMAN. The time of thegentleman has expired.Mrs. GRLirrHS. Mr. Chairman, Iyield the gentleman 5 additional minutes.Mr. ULLMAN. Insofar as the Statesupplements are concerned, we are goingto pay up to the poverty level 30 per-cent of all of the costs of State supple-mentation on top of this all-Federal pro-gram. Adding it up, this program opensup the Treasury of the United States ina way that it has never been opened upbefore in our history. An individual fillsout a form and says \"I have $1,500 ofassets and I have so much income.\" Hefills It out and sends the form In toWashington. It presumably runs througha computer to see if the man has re-ported his income correctly or not. Thenthis table Is consulted to determine howmuch he Is eligible for. Then the checkgoes out. Every 100 persons or some suchfigure will be spot checked. However, Iwant to remind you that it Is terribly113097 expensive in a program like this to check.There Is not sufficient money here forany kind of adequate check on the pay-ments. Remember we are talking about2.9 million new family heads that willbegin receiving checks from the FederalGovernment on top of the existing 1.7million welfare recipients already receiv-ing checks from the State.Mr. HUNGATE. Mr. Chairman, willthe gentleman ULLMAN. Yes. Iyieldto the gentleman.Mr. HUNGATE. The report mentionedreform in here. Is there any place thatthis would reduce the number of thoseon welfare? Is there any contention bythe gentleman to that effect?Mr. ULLMAN. Of course this wouldnot reduce It. This would add 2.9 millionfamilies. And the people who talk aboutan incentive to get off of welfare are justtalking about pie in the sky. Everybodywho Is a realist knows that it will nothappen. If you look at this kind of a table,there is nothing in there to induce any-body to get off of it, in my judgment.Mr. HUNOATE. On that Issue of re-form, is there any place that you can re-duce the cost of the welfare programs tothe Government?Mr. ULLMAN. In this program?.Mr. HUNGATE. Yes.Mr. ULLMAN. No. This would add ontop of all the welfare costs we have todaywell over $4 billion, but I think it wouldbe far beyond that by the time the pro-gram gets into operation.Let me goon very quickly.Let us look at the integrity of socialsecurity. For years we have had a basicprinciple that you do not mix welfare andsocial security.The CHAIRMAN. The time of thegentleman from Oregon has again ex-pired.Mrs. GRIFFITHS. Mr. Chairman, Iyield the gentleman 5 additional min-utes.Mr. ULLMAN. But, uflder this pro-gram we are putting the Social SecurityAdministration Into the welfare busi-ness.Further, and contrary to what hasbeen said, It will not stop desertions orreunite families. The statistics are veryclear. Many States that do Include Un-SCHEDULE OF ANNUAL York havea much higher rate of desertion thanStates that do not include them. Youcannot find a correlation between thetwo.The work requirement is a delusion.There Is not an3' question about it. Youwould have to give the poor $2 billionthat you have for the working poor andput it all Into work training and childcare to even make a dent in the problemof taking care of the people already onwelfare, let alone these 2.9 million newfamilies that we are adding to the wel-fare rolls.Now, Mr. Chairman, there are all kinds of loose ends in this program. Thefirst thing that I think Members arebeginning to feel already is the pressureto increase the $1,600 base.These pressures are going to growby leaps and bounds. There is no anchorin this program. We have got a movablefeast of figures. There Is no rationale.Once we pass this bill, then I think allthe stops are out, and we are on our way,and in place of a, $5 billion program,this Is going to wind up a $20 billion pro-gram.Mr. YRNES of Wisconsin. Mr. Chair-m,. will the gentleman yield?Mr. TJLLMAN. I yield to the gentle-man from Wisconsin.Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin. Mr. Chair-man, I do not want to interrupt thetrain of thought of the gentleman, butI understand the gentleman says thatthis is going to be administered as partof the Social Security Old-Age and Sur-vivors Insurance Act, or Social Scour-ity Administration, as we think of It inthose terms.Mr. ULLMAN. I said by the Social Se-curity Administration. The Social Se-curity Administration will administer the act.Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin. But I thinkthe gentleman should recognize that thecommittee made it clear that is exactlywhat we do not want done. If the gen-tleman will turn to page 27 of the re-port, he will see where we say:It is the intent of your committee that anew agencywouldbe established In the De-partment of Health, Education, and Wel-fare to administer the family assistanceplan.We also say\u2014and I will not read thewhole paragraph, but we also say:Por example, while the administration ofthe family assistance plan would be com-pletely separate and distinct from the so-cialinsuranceprograms,thecommittee would expect that the computer equipmentand other capabilities of the Social Secu-rity Administration would be utilized in theadministration of the family assistance planto the extent It Is economical and efficientto do so.So we make it very clear It is not go-ing to be administered by the Social Se-curity Administration.Mr. ULLIIAN. I will say to the gen-tleman\u2014Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin. If thegentleman will yield further, I say that,as I think the gentleman remembers,that I,too, had that concern If youwould Intermingle this theadministration of the old-age and sur-CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014 HOUSEvivors insurance system by the Social Se-curity Administration, and that it wouldbe Inadvisable. And It was the result ofthose concerns that I had, and othershad, that we put this language specifi-cally into the report.The CHAIRMAN. The time of thegentleman has expired.Mr. iJLLMAN. Mr. Chairman, I won-der if I may have 2 additional minutesto respond?Mr. MILLS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3additional minutes tothe gentlemanfrom Oregon. - Mr.ULLMAN. Mr. Chairman, I thankthe gentleman for the additional time.Mr. Chairman, all I can say Is this:Time after time in our hearings, and inour executive sessions, Mr. Ball, the Ad-ministrator of the Social Security Ad-ministration, indicated that In some in-stances this would be handled in the so-cial security offices, and others it wouldnot. Be that as it may, then that you aresaying is that we are going to have a com-pletely new welfare office in every com-munity across this land.Now, on top of everything else, on topof all the bureaucratic mess, we havethese new welfare offices all across theland.Mr. Chairman, let me summarize:First. The bill does not achieve funda-mental reform. Reform should be builton the solid foundation of experience,and should be backed by clearly definedprinciples understood by all. In my judg-ment, the bill is deceptive in nature andclearly understood by very few. The heartof welfare reform should be human re-habilitation, There is little of that in thisbill.Second. The bill does not provide asound work incentive program. It raisesthe expectations of the poor for jobsthrough a universal work registrationrequirement, and then dashes them bygrosslyunderfinancing theprograms needed to make the jobs possible.Third. The bill means more bureauc-racy, hot less. It gives sweeping authorityto the Secretaries of Health, Education.and Welfare and of Labor to direct thenew program, but provides little guid-ancefor 'administrativereform. Themess of the existing system will be com-pounded under the new program.Fourth. The bill establishes the basisfor a guaranteed annual Income througha negative tax formula. It would per-manently consn more than 10 percentof our national population to welfarehandouts.The expansion of the Federal welfarerolls to include 3 million families classi-fied as the \"working poor\" Is a risky ex-periment based on an untried formula.We know next to nothing about the ef-fects of guaranteeing the annual incomeof low-wage earners. The administrationhas trumpeted results of tests it has con-ducted in this area as evidence that theeffect is positive, and that the desire towork Is not destroyed by supplementalcash handouts.While there are some encouraging as-pects to these tests, It would be a gravemistake to use them as any kind of prec-edent for this legislation. The evidenceso far is at best fragmentary. The OEOApril 15, 1970project in New Jersey Involves a fewhundred families and has been under-way for only about a year, The directorof this project, Harold Watts, told thecommittee earlier this year that his teamhas so far achieved \"very incompleteand preliminary findings about low-in-come work behavior.\" He uses completelydifferent criteria and the program Isoverburdened with administrative costs.He also told the committee that the$64 question remains unanswered: Willcashhandoutsmotivatelow-incomeworkers to increase their skills and makeit on their own after the payments end?Much more research is needed on mat-ters of this magnitude.In my judgment, there is a strong pos-sibility that the grand design for theworking poor under FAP may go badlyawry, and in fact result in a disincentiverather than an incentive to work. Cashhandouts from the Federal Governmentto raise their earned incomes could re-placethedesiretoearn additionalwages. Tax-free Federal benefits and ac-cess to food stamps could in many casesprovide a strong incentive for remainingIn the low-income group and on the wel-fare rolls.Without question, there is need forreal reform of our welfare system. Weneed to make a real effort to streamlineand consolidate the administrative net-work that operates the national welfaresystem. When we have cut down thebureaucracy, we could hope to apply suc-cessfully uniform standards for welfareeligibility and uniform procedures fordispensing benefits.Above all, we need to expand greatlyour federally aided programs aimed atemploying welfare workers. These in-clude the work incentive program, thespecial projects program for employmentin the public sector, the JOBS programcoordinated with the business commun-ity, and child care. We need to launchan organized effort to ensure thit jobsfor the trained welfare beneficiary willbe available when he is ready- to go towork.The extra billions to be spent on wel-fare should go In this direction, not to-ward larger and larger cash paymentsfor millions of Americans. This bill wouldpretend to go both ways at the same time.This Is Impossible. If work Is to be em-phasized, we cannot also underwrite abroad system of cash payments. If weaccept the cash payment approach asproposed by this bill, then we have be-gun to move away irrevocably from workincentives to solve our poverty problems.A choice of this magnitude should notbe made lightly.I would say in conclusion that this billshould be recommitted. This bill will noteliminate poverty. It Is only going to in-stitutionalize It, and it Is going to lead tounending problems year after year forevery Member of this body.Mr. MATSUNAGA. Mr. Chairman, willthe gentleman yield?Mr. ULLMAN. I yield to the gentle-man.Mr. MATSUNAGA. Mr. Chairman, asa member of the Rules Committee, I wasprivileged to listen to the pros and conson the bill (H.R. 16311) to authorize a April 15, 1970familyassistanceprogram providingbasic benefits to low-income familieswith children, to an extensive degree.I voted to grant a rule to permit theconsideration of this measure by the fullHouse. I will' vote again for the passageof H.R. 16311 because I believe that Intheory it is a step In the right direction.I am especially pleased to note the in-clusion of an incentive program designedto encourage those now on the welfarerolls to seek employment, and where not trained for employment to be pre-pared for employment under a proposedtraining program. However, as I ob-servedduringtheRules Committeehearings, I doubt very much that theprogram as outlined in the pending billwill succeed. I say this because the ad-ministration appears to be headed inthe opposite direction where the_unem-ployment situation is concerned.On the one hand, the administration isproposing that those now on relief betrained for jobs to become self-sustain-ing. On the other hand, the administra-tion appears bent on Increasing the un-employment rate to as much as 5.5 per-cent In its effort to stem the tide of in-flation. In the view of many economists,with whom I agree, the administrationis acting on a mistaken theory. How canthe administration hope to place newlytrained workers into jobs when it Is do-ing nothing to create jobs into whichthey can be placed. Instead, the admin-istration, by Its economic policy, is noweliminating jobs and Increasing the un-employment roll to such an extent thatthose previously employed will be com-peting with the newly trained formerwelfare recipients for the limited num-ber of jobs available, if any.Mr.Chairman1unless the Presidentreverses his present position,in the realization that his policy of stemmingInflation through increased unemploy-ment is a failure, and unless the Presi-dent awakens to the fact that Inflation isnot a necessary complement to full em-ployment, his so-called workfare pro-gram embodied in the pending bill cannever be successfully launched. I repeat,Mr. Chairman, H.R. 16311 is a step Inthe right direction in theory, but in prac-tice the program which It proposes willfailmiserably unlessthe President'spolicy on unemployment is altered. Invoting for this measure, I will do so inthe fervent hope that the President willtake Immediate action to alter his policyto insure the success of this program.Mr. BETrS. Mr. Chairman, I yield my-self 10 minutes.Mr. Chairman, I hesitate to follow mychairman and my ranking minorityleader. After the very brilliant and com-prehensive statements they have made insupport of this bill, I feel that anythingI may say will be anticlimax. I certainlywant toassociate myself with theirremarks.Mr. Chairman, to me some of the prob-lems we have had in trying to resolve thisissue is the same we have had with re-spect to any number of bills. In otherwords, the complaints I get are, \"I am forwelfare reform, except\u2014.\" It Is the samesituation we had on the tax reform bill\u2014\"I am for tax reform\u2014except--\u2014.\" It IsCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014HOUSEthe same we have when It comes to econ-omy in government\u2014\"I am for economyin government, except so long as it doesnot affect me.\"I want to repeat what the chairmansaid. I sat throughout all of the hearings,and I attended a majority of the execu-tive sessions. I failed to hear anybodypresent any other welfare reform meas-ure then. The only testimony we had inour committee, so far as I am able torecall\u2014and I am willing to be correctedif I am wrong\u2014were statements eitherfor the bill or against the bill and noth-ing constructive, so far as any substituteprogram is concerned.So that makes the problem of the Com-mittee on Ways and Means just a littlebit difficult.This is a complicated and comprehen-sive bill. I do not want to appear to beoversimplifying It, but my only purposeis to make a few brief observations andsort of pinpoint some of the answers tothe objections that we have receivedalong the lines the chairman and theminority leader have expressed on thefloor.The first objection we hear is that It isa guaranteed income. Let me say in re-sponse to that that It Is no more a guar-anteed Income than present welfare pro-grams which are simply Federal contri-butions to State programs, for welfarepayments on the basis of poverty levelsor payment levels or some other assur-ance that people on welfare are going toget definite relief.Now the classic definition of guaran-teed income is an Income which assuresincome regardless of work or need orearnings. This present formula of $1,600Is exactly the opposite. In my opinion, itis a ceiling instead of an assurance of aminimum. It places a ceiling up to whichthe Federal Government Isgoingto con- tribute, taking into consideration all theother factors of work and of earnings andneed. So really, and I think the chair-than made this very plain as well as theminority leader, that In no sense of theword so far as the classic definition isconcerned is this a guaranteed Income.Second, there Is the complaint aboutcosts. This is In a sense repetition, but Ithink it Is worth It and It is in the re-port if you have read it.In the last 10 years the number of peo-ple on the payroll as recipients under thepresent. welfare programs has Increasedfrom 2.4 million persons to 6 mIllion per-sons\u2014in 10 years.Also, the cost of the present welfareprogram in the last 5 years has tripledto $4 billion. The plain fact is simplythis: If you want to continue a programsuch as that, a good way to do It Is tovote against this bill, because that wouldbe assurance that you are going to con-tinue a program which has been triplingits expenses every 4 years.The main thrust of this bill Is graftedto an attempt to reduce these costs. Someof you may have read in the last fewdays, or at least a couple of weeks-Ithink it came to the office of every Mem-ber\u2014a statement from the NationalAssociation of Manufacturers, which Iscertainly not regarded as a liberal orga-nization, analyzing, I think in a friendlyH 3099way, the possibility of teduclon of costsIn this welfare proposal, It says, simplystated, that in spite of the fact that therewill certainly be an Increase In the cost ofthis program immediately, that It hadthe potential of ultimate reduction Incost.I was very much interested and almostIntrigued by a statement which appearedin the February Issue of the New EnglandLetter, which Is put out by the First Na-tional Bank of Boston, and which Iassume also is certainly not a liberal or-ganization. I wish to quote from It:The goal of employment rather than de-pendency is widely acclaimed, as is the pros-pect that welfare families would Stay putrather than flock to the states and cities withthe most generous payments. The present sys-tem is so hated by recipient and taxpayeralike that the estimated cost of an added $4billion per year is less of a hurdle even at thistime of budget stringency. As the plan movesinto Congressional debate much sniping canbe expected, and such adjuncts or alterna-tives as family allowances and a negativeincome tax or promise of a small guaranteedincome will receive attention. Liberals andconservatives will find it difficult to opposethese improvements in a welfare systemwhich has become increasingly out of stepwith reality.The third objection is the one of add-ing the working poor. I think the figureusually given Is 12 millIon without takinginto consideration the fact that these aresimply temporary additions until theprogram gets underway, after which thewhole philosophy, the whole purpose, thewhole main thrust Is to remove peoplefrom the welfare programs and reducethe cost.I took It upon myself last Monday totake the floor and to address myself tothe opposition, which I think was prettywidespread, and all Members of Congresswere well aware of It, of the U.S. Cham-ber of Commerce to this bill. I pointedout In a 1-minute speech last Mondaythat the chamber of commerce last fallhad taken a poll of Its members and 86percent of them had responded in favorof this bill, citing the work Incentive pro-gram as the reason for their support. Isaid I did that on Monday so, in fairness,the chamber of commerce could replybefore the bill was brought up for debate.And they did, In a letter to me datedApril 14, which I have permission to putinto the RECORD at the end of myremarks.But I want to read this one paragraphfrom this letter, which I think Is Iinpor-tant from the point of view of the HouseMembers considering who Is and who Isnot In opposition to this bill and howmuch.The National Chamber supports welfarereform and believes that some parts of theHouse bill are progressive. Our objection isdirected only at the part of the bill thatcommits taxpayers to begin guaranteeing anincome tofamilies with fully employedfathers. Once this concept Is established, wecan visualize it would not be long beforeone-third or more of the Naitiorjal populationwould be receiving income sajpplemente, at aoost of $20 billion or more annually.As I read this letter from an organiza-tion which was widely reputed to havebeen In opposition to this bill. But, andI repeat, It says that ts opposition Is 113100limited to the concept of the guaranteedincome as it applies only to the workingfather or to the working poor.The concept of the working poor, ashas been well explained by the chairmanand by the ranking minority member, Ispart of the main thrust of this bill.The CHAIRMAN. The time of the gen-tleman from Ohio has expired.Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin. Mr. Chair-man, I yield the gentleman from OhIo 10additional minutes.Mr. BET'FS. Mr. Chairman, the bulk ofall the complaints I have received overthe years to welfare programs is thattoo many people under the present pro-grams are allowed to work and receivewelfare at the same time. it is this cur-rent exclusion of the working poor fami-lies which makes it possible for the work-ing people to be better off by gettingwelfare than by working. The very thingthis bill does, is to remove this objection.The third objection is, of course, thework incentive, and there seems to havebeen a great deal of comment about aNew Jersey plan and about this work In-centives program Is a complete failure.As I sat In the committee and listenedto all these people testify, as far as Iknow nobody spoke against the program.They did explain\u2014and I can be correctedif I am wrong\u2014that there are manyaspects that could be improved.That is the main thrust of their testi-mony, but nobody as I can recall hassaid that the WIN program Is a failure.Let me call the attention of Members,to a statement made by the Ohio Gover-nor, James A. Rhode not long ago, andI am reading now from a clipping whichappearedIna newspaper circulatedwidely In Ohio.Governor James A. Rhodes last week praisedthe 20 counties which are making use ofthe Work Incentive Program to help get in-dividuals in jobs and families off welfarerolls.The Governor said that from Jan. 1, 1969.through Jan. 28, 1970, these counties haveplaced 892 enrolleesof the Work Incentive(WIN) Program in meaningful employmentand that welfare rolls have been reduced asa result by a total of 4,480 persons.This has resulted in a monthly savings of$247,643 In welfare payments, he noted.I mention this, not only because Itcomes from my State but also because itis pretty concrete proof that If this WINprogram is given an opportunity to work,it will.As I said, I do not want to oversimplifythe Issues here, but I simply want to tryto pinpoint some of the answers to theobjections to the bill.In conclusion I want to point out thisto the Members of the House. The Presi-dent of the United States and two execu-tive departments, the Department ofHealth, Eduction, and Welfare and theDepartment of Labor, have spent hoursand months trying to come up with somesolution to the age-old complaints aboutthe present welfare programs. This Istheir answer. The Ways and Means Com-mittee has spent hours and days andweeks of deliberations and has, with re-fining amendments, approved this pro-posal overwhelmingly.On the basis of this tremendous amountof work, honest and conscientious effortCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEto answer the objections which have beenmade to the present welfare program overthe years, I do not hesitate to ask theHouse to support this bill.Mr. Chairman, at this point I Insertthe letter I referred to earlier from theChamber of Commerce dated April 14,1970:CHAMBER OF C0MERcE OF THE UNITED-STATES,Washington, D.C., April 14,1970.Hon. JACKSON E. BETIS,House of Representatives,Washington, D.C.DEAR Ma. BE'rrs: I was sorry to learn, fromyour statement In the Congressional Recordof April 13, that you apparently have sometrouble reconciling the National Chamber'scurrent opposition to H.R. 16311 wIth theresulte of the informal poll conducted lastfall at our Urban Action Forums in 15 cities,which seemed to show support for the Presi-dent's welfare reform proposal.Actually, the poll did not deal with thewelfare issue as it stands today.The poll, taken of our members and othersin atendance at the meetings, showed 86.5%in favor of \"welfare reforms\" promised by theAdministration. But at that time, the Ad-ministration's program was not recognizedas something that would guarantee on in-come for many families with fully employedfathers.Of the 2,163 persons poled. 47% saId thatwhat they wanted most was \"to requirewelfare recipients who can do so, to takework or take training.\" Another 81% saidthey wanted most \"to make taxpayers out ofmany welfare Clearly, majorityopinion in the poll was foe' substitutingworkfare for' welfare, where possible.But when the legislation came along, itprovided for welfare expansion. not,reform,by tripling the number of persons on wel-fare. It would add to the welfare rolls some3 million more families (15 million persons),all headed by fathers already working fulltime.This provision had been thoroughly cam-ouflaged in earlier discussions of the pro-grain, and no wonder, because it's the entrywedge for the guaranteed annual income. Itextends the guarantee, as a starter, to lam-Ilies with fully employed fathers. If anyhead of such a family refused to work, orto take a better paying job If he was alreadyworking, his share ($300 a year) would bededucted from the family welfare allotment,but the rest of the family allotment isguaranteed, with nothing required and noquestions asked about how the money Isspent.Once a program like that got started,where would It end? Even at the outset,large families with Incomes of more than$7,000 would qualify for this new federalrelIef. The average worker's pay Is $6,000.A family with seven children, earning $6,000would get $460 a year in tax-free welfare.Businessmen polled last fall had no hintthat anything like this was In the works.Our position relative to the pending wel..fare issue was developed only after long andcareful consideration. It was recommendedby a Special Committee on Welfare Programsand Income Maintenance, made up of 14distinguished top business executives Whostudied the welfare problem for more than ayear. Our Board of Directors, whose 64 mem-bers come from all types of business in allparts of the country, formulated our policy,based on the committee's recommendations,in February.1969. Our Board received aprogress report In November. 1969 and reaf-firmed our posItion In February, 1970.The National Chamber Federation com-prises 2,700 local, state and regional cham-bers and American chambers abroad, 1,100trade and professional associations and 37.-000 business firma and individuals,April 15,1970It should be no surprise that the Cham-ber opposes the concept of a guaranteed in-come. We believe this Is In accord wIth pub-lic sentiment. A Gallup Poll in 1968 revealed58% opposed, 36% In favor, and 6% wIth noopinion.The National Chamber supports welfarereform and believes that some parts of theHouse bill are progressive. Our objection isdirected only at the part of the bill thatcommits taxpayers to begin guaranteeingan income to families with fully employedfathers, Once this concept is established, wevisualize it would not be long before one-third or more of the National populationwould be receiving income supplements, ata cost of $20 billion or more annually.Considering the potential impact of thislegislation on taxpayers, it does seem ap-propriate that the bill come before the Houseon April 15 or thereabouts.I would appreciate your placing thIs letterin the Congressional Record, as our answerto your statement.Cordially,HILTON DAVIS,General Manager, Legislative Action.Mr. BUSH. Mr. Chairman, will thegentleman yield?Mr. BETI'S. I yield to the gentleman.(Mr. BUSH asked and was givenpermission torevise and extend hisremarks.)Mr. BUSH. Mr. Chairman, In my viewthe family assistance bill reported out ofthe Ways and Means Committee Is ameaningful breakthrough Inwelfare legislation.It addresses Itselfto the ethical and financial realities of work InAmerica today. The heritage of thiscountry emphasizes the importance, full-filment, and goodness of work. Yet wefind ourselves today with a system ofwelfare under which people are betteroff manipulating the system and gettingonto welfare than In working at a lowwage job.One of the most common complaints Ihear from people back home Is \"How canpeople be out of work when the wantads are full of jobs?\" They are disturbedthat people take welfare when they couldbe working and they have a right to bedisturbed. It is their ,tax dollars that aresupporting the welfare program.It is time we did something to help theman who is working for a living, tryingto educate his children and trying tofeed them as costs rise out of sight. TheWays and Means Committee kept thisproblem in mind and tried to find a bet-ter way of taking care of those who can-not help themselves while at the sametime building work Incentives Into theprogram for those who are unemployedor no hold low-paying jobs and may bethinking of \"going to welfare.\"In designing an effective welfare pro-gram we cannot Ignore the movementbetween the working poor and welfarestatus for there is a positive statisticalcorrelation here. In Texas, for example.a man with a family of four is entitledto a welfare payment equal to $179 permonth. For a nonwelfare family of fourto do as well, the head of the hOuseholdmust earn the equivalent to $221 permonth and this adds up to an hourlywage of $1.25. In Michigan it comes outto $1.94 per hour; In Massachusetts,$2.16; and In New York, $2.23. Whyshould a man or woman take a job foranything less? Yet most do, And this Is April 15,1970oneof the wonderful things about thiscountry\u2014people would rather work thannot work.Yet, we are endangering this impor-tant national characteristic by perpetu-ating a system that actually encouragespeople not to work. We have encouragedIndividuals who expect the Governmentto take care of them. The incentives inthe present program that encourage thisshould be changed and I think this billcan do the job\u2014I think It should be tried.It provides positive incentives by requir-ing those who accept welfare to registerfor work or work training; by permittingthose who work to keep substantial por-tions of their earned income; and by ex-pendingjobtrainingandday-care opportunities.There are those who feel that thisprogram is too expensive and I, for one,believe they have a valid point. But thealternative\u2014the present Federal-State-local welfare system is even more expen-sive. If we do nothing, the costs of theprogram will be $12 billion by 1975 andwe will haie spawned a new generationof welfare i'ecipients and broken homes.There are others who feel that the pro-gram will only provide the framework foran even more expensive welfare system\u2014one that in the future would provide a$5,500 guaranteed annual income foreveryone. If this were a characteristic ofthis program, It would not have my sup-port, the support of the Ways and MeansCommittee or the support of PresidentNixon. The family assistance plan, re-ported by the committee, Is oriented to-ward work and is aimed only at families\u2014these are not characteristics of a guaran-teed annual income plan. Further, thepresent Federal-State welfare systemcomes a great deal closer to being aguaranteed annual income as it encour-ages Idleness by making it more profitableto be on welfare than to 'bork and pro-vides no method by which the States maylimit the number of individuals added tothe rolls.1 must confess that I have one majorworry about the program and that Isthat the work incentive provisions willnot be enforced. In order to be success-ful, It is essential that the program beadministered as visualized by the Waysand Means Committee; namely, If anIndividual does not work, he will not re-ceive funds. Enforcement Is essential; ifthe work requirement Is not enforced itcould simply lead to another boondoggle.In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, we needto reform the welfare system, build workincentives into It, help with job train-ing, provide day-care centers and Jobplacement and, in short, permit familiesto work their way off welfare. The familyassistance plan can do this.The handout approach has failed. Theexisting system strips a man of his dig-nity. Let us reform the welfare systemwith woft Incentives\u2014not crush It fur-ther by more giveaways.Mr. MORTON. Mr. Chairman, will thegentleman yield?Mr. BE'rrs. I yield to the gentleman.(Mr. MORTON asked and Wa., givenpermission to revise and extend his re-marks.)CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014HOUSEMr. MORTON. Mr. Chairman, Presi-dent Nixon has submitted to the Congressseveral innovative proposals which pro-vide a needed new direction toward whathe calls the' \"new federalism.\"This Famiiy Assistance Act of 1970 isa major piece of legislation which I be-.lieve will help achieve that objective. Itis a bold. move to effect a more significantcoordination of effort bqtween the Fed-ral, State, and local governments. Withthe Federal Government providing theuniform floor for eligibility and paymentrequirements and absorbing the neces-sary increased costs, we are moving to-ward an equitable and efficient reform ofour troubled welfare system.In his message to the Congress pro-posing the transformation of welfare in-to \"workfare,\" a new work-rewardingsystem, the President stressed that theeffect of his plan would be:For the first time, all dependent familieswith children in America, regardless of wherethey live, would be assured of minimumstandard payments based upon uniform andsingle eligibility standards.For the first time, the more than two mil-lion families who make up the \"working poor\"would be helped toward self-sufficiency andaway from future welfare dependency.For the first time, training and work op-portunity with effective incentives would begiven millions of families who would other-wise be locked into a welfare system for gen-erations.For the first time, the Fderal Oovernmentwould make a strong contribution toward re-lieving the financial burden of welfare pay-ments from State governments.For the first time, every depencient familyin America would be encouraged to stay to-gether, free from economic pressure to splitapart.The 'bill before us, 16311, wouldbring about those Presl&ent Nixon statedIn. his message proposing a comprehen-sive Manpower Training Act, which Ihope will soon be coming before us forenactment, that such a manpower pro-gram \"Is a good example of a new direc-'tion in making federalism work.\" I feelthat the same applies to the pendingFamily Assistance Act of 1970.The President stated further in hismanpower program message:We can relate substantial Federal-Statemanpower efforts to other efforts, tax sharingand economic opportunity, marshaling theresources of the departments and. agenciesinvolved to accomplish a broad mission.I quote that statement to emphasizethat aid to and greater cooperation withthe cost-beleaguered States is one of theforemost needs which the Federal Gov-ernment must meet. In attacking thesocial ills of the day, the new federalismIs going to the root causes of poverty.The Family Assistance Act of 1970 wIlltackle one of the most troublesome prob-lems confronting our State and local gov-ernments. Those governrnents\"are cryingfor financial relief, and the needy pebpleof the Nation are struggling against theever-increasing cost of living. They willall be helped\u2014the State and local gov-ernments and the dependent Ameri-cans\u2014by enactment of this bill. Theyand the country's taxpayers will behelped further toward ).mprovement In113101our economic climate when PresidentNixon's manpower and tax sharing pro-grams are translated into law.Let us, therefore, Mr. Chairman, takethat first big step, make that start-up'cost investment In a better America forall, by the expeditious passage of H.R.16311. The CHAIRMAN. The Chair advisesthat the minority side has consumed 1hour and 43 minutes and the majorityside has consumed 1 hour and 33 min-utes.Mr. MILLS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 7minutes to the gentleman from Ohio(Mr. VANIX), a member of the commit-tee. The gentleman is our last speakerfor the day on this side.Mr. VANIK. Mr. Chairman, the Fam-ily Assistance Act of 1970 which we areconsidering today is an imperfect bill,designed to deal with circumstances andconditions which have developed in ourimperfectsociety.Theproposalis unique in that it draws support fromthese forces which seek to restrain wel-fare expenditures as well as from thosewho are determined to improve the lifeof those who are unemployed, under-employed, and on welfare.In any event, the legislation movestoward the federalization of welfare, es-tablishing minimum standards of familysupport without geographical discrimi-nation and provide a uniform system ofreview of work eligibility of the unem-ployed.Insofar as the Federal contribution to-ward welfare will be Increased, It consti-tutes a revenue sharing with the States.There has been and there will con-tinue to be extensive discussion as to thecost of the family assistance program.Itisdifficult to estimate costs wheneconomic conditions make it so difficultto forecast the extent of unemploymentand the resulting need for family assist-ance or the potential need for adjust-ing family assistance allocations to meetthe escalating cost of living.The chart on additional costs of thisrogram submitted by the Departmentof Health, Education, and Welfare andset forth in the committee report onpage 53, Is Incredibly naive and unrealis-tic. Although the table assumes a 4-percent growth, no provision is madefor the Increase in the cost of living orthe effect of increased eligibility result-ing from further and mounting unem-ployment which lurks in the wings. Theseetsimates are optimistic beyond reason.We must relate the family assistanceprogram to the fearful contingency ofincreased unemployment which appearsto be designed in our economic structure.I cannot share the feeling of securitywhiclf'prevalls on the present conditionof the unemployment compensation fundand its capacity to face up to a difficulteconomic challenge.At the resent time, there are 50.9 mil-lion workers covered under Stale unem-ployment compensation laws. The wagesof these workers in 1968 totaled $331,562,-437,000. Can we assume that 3.5 Percentof the total wages of 1 year Is a sufficientreserve? T2its reserve Is sufficient for onlythe mildest of attacks of unemployment. H 3102For each of the almost 51 millionworkers In the insured work force of theUnited States, there Is bout $262 in theunemployment insurance fund. Six per-cent unemployment of insured workerswould cost the unemployment insurancefund $6 to $7 billion per year. Two yearsof 6 percent unemployment of insuredworkers, a rate which prevailed in 1958,would completely deplete the unemploy-ment insurance fund. It certainly wouklnot carry us through anything more thana mild recession.What we must realize in consideringthe Family AssistanceAct is that it maybe extensivly used to back up and rein-force the unemployment compensationprogram which is rapidly becoming un-responsive to its avowed purpose of in-come support for the unemployed.The family assistance prograip mayvery well constitute a huge dip into Gen-eral Treasury funds to assume an obli-gation we thought would be undertakenby employers under the UnemploymentCompensation Act. In a great measure,the burden of responsibility for incomemaintenance for the trained but unem-ployed worker will shift from the em-ployer to the general taxpayer. We mustunderstand what we are about.If a fully trained insured worker withthree dependents Is unemployed In Ohiofor 1 year, he receives $61 per week for26 weeks or $1,586. In Florida, such aworker would receive a maximum of $40per week for 26 weeks, or a total of$1,040, while in New York State such aworker would receive $65 per week for26 weeks or a total of 1,690. All of thesesituati$ons are entitled to supplementa-tion under the family assistance pro-gram\u2014at an open-end cost. Do we reallyintend to use the family assistance pro-gram as a substitute for a meaningfulunemployment compensation programwhich provides Income maintenance fora trained insured worker during a pe-riod of prolonged unemployment?As presently constituted the unem-ployment compensation program is amost Inadequate law\u2014designed only forthe best of times. It Is incapable of per-forming as an income maintenance sys-tem durIng conditions of growing andpersistant unemployment. The needs ofthe unemployment compensation systemshould not be dependent upon the fam-ily assistance program.During our discussions on this pro-posal, we also studied the comparativeeffect of family ssistance under thisprogram with family assistance for mili-tary dependents under preva.lllpg mili-tary wage scales.It appears that a family of four sus-tained by a member of the armed servicesin the lower three grades Is compelledto exist on resources below poverty levelsand below what we provide under thisbill. Today, almost 150,000 military de-pendents live below the income levelsprovided under this bill. It is incrediblethat our Nation should conscript a citi-zen and then order his family to liveon public welfare\u2014but such is the casefor many. To meet this problem, we mustInsure an adequate increase In depend-ency allowances for military dependents,particularly in the lower grades.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEThe recent postal employees strike inNew York demonstrated the error ofincome levels which make no allowancefor cost-of-living differentials. The sameproblem is built into this legislation andI hope that our oversight will be cor-rected by the other body. It is readilyapparent that the income maintenanceneeds are certainly higher in my com-munity and other high-cost urban areasthan they are in rural or small-towncommunities.In full knowledge of the great short-comings and uncertainties which arepresent in this proposal, I give it my sup-port because it improves what we have,it moves in the right direction and repre-sents an effort to meet the challenge.Mr. BURKE of Florida. Mr. Chairman,I join with those that feel that no Amer-ican family should go hungry and thatno child should suffer\u2014certainlY, thatevery individual should have the oppor-tunity to gain self respect and familysecurity\u2014are facts that I certainly donot contest. However, I am worried aboutthe new concept of welfare that we con-sider today. I endorse its intent to trainand put the unemployed Into the fieldof employable and productive jobhold-ers, but, I fear that if this legislationpasses we will create Instead a new classof welfare recipients. While the Presi-dent's laudable proposals to bring orderto the present chaotic conglomerate ofwelfare programs are commendable anddesperately needed, the prospect of 12million Americans becoming new mem-bers of the growing welfare state ap-pails me.We have seen welfare grow into aprofessional and practical way of life,for some and to become internieshed asa part of our Nation's economy and so- cial character. When it was begun Inthe depression days of the 1930's underthe New Deal, it was considered only astopgap, and President Roosevelt himselfthen admitted that the Nation \"must andshall quit this business of relief\"\u2014and,he further added:To dole out relief In this way Is to ad-minister a narcotic, a subtle destroyer ofthe human spirit.His advice was not followed and hencewe have what is today called the welfaremess.President Nixon properly proposesthat we reverse the direction of the wel-fare system. His proposals to establishtraining programs through work incen-tives and a means to credit higher educa-tion are a commendable step in the rightdirection. But a further step in thisdirection and one that I believe wouldhave a more practical result withoutadditional cost to the taxpayer is theproposal\u2014H.R.2067\u2014knownastheHuman Investment Act that I introducedand which would give a tax credit tobusiness fiims for inplant training ofworkers.I do not believe that the bill beforeus\u2014.-H.R. 16311\u2014which, under the rule,we are asked to consider without oppor-tunity to offer amendments, achieves thegoals that are needed today or eventhat President Nixon has set. Instead It seems Inevitable that thenumber ofApril 15,1970those added to the roles of the profitablyunemployed\u2014those who seek a reasonnot to work will increase even more withthe years than it has In the past.In this day of inflation and ever in-creasing taxes we are faced with the factthat this bill before us will increase theFederal budget some $5 billion or more.The proposed Federal contribution tofamily assistance in the first year is ex-pected to cost $3.8 billion plus $386 mil-lion which is allocated for day care. Inaddition, we may add to this the extracosts of job training and increased bene-fits to the blind, aged, and disabled whocannot work. But the important factorsare that we can envision in the next 3 to4 years a proposed increase of 12 millionplus new welfare recipients at possibleskyrocketing future costs. An outpour-ing of more and more money from thepockets of the active hard-working wageearners of the country bring questionsfrom them.My State of Florida is today facedwith a severe test of its ability to absorban ever growing population and furtherState participation in today's welfareprograms. We must accept the recentSupreme Court ruling that residence re-quirements no longer apply when apply-ing for welfare benefits. The number ofneedy who could move into Florida be-cause of our natural attractions maymount an alarming rate. It would greatlyaffect and imperil Florida's overall econ-omy and strain its present tax structurebeyond limits.I feel the biggest factor we must con-sider in this legislation is that the pro-posal begins for all practical purposes thecreation of a \"minimum income\" for allAmericans. Expanded socialism, if youplease. It does so through establishmentof full benefits for a family of four at a$1,600 level and it even increases thisschedule despite 50 percent earnings re-tention provisions to $3,9?0 for the samefamily. It is inevitable that in the yearsthat will follow these limits might be thetarget of some demagog or ambitiouspolitician who, through such socialisticmeasures, could attempt to control andrun from Washington the lives of everyman, woman, and child in America.In this program for the benefit ofpoverty families with dependent chil-dren there also lurks the insidious anddangerous creation of another powerfulvoting political bloc\u2014that of those onthe relief roles\u2014a bloc that could easilynumber into the millions. Indeed, it hasalready begun with the formation of theNational Welfare Rights Organization,whose first lemand is elimination of allrequirements for a work-training pro-gram, Increase of proposed benefits, andraising of the poverty level determina-tion. In these days, such requests couldlead to more marches, disruptions, dis-order, and division within our country.I hope this Congress can, and I ex-pect it will, move quickly to help thosefamilies which are truly needy and de-serving who require the assistance ofboth the State and Federal Governments.But I suggest that my colleagues in theCongress will recognize that self-help,job training, education, and above all pride of the family are the important April 15,1970factorsrequired in America today. Pov-erty must not be accepted with pride.It must be overcome with compassionand understanding without creating theogre of a national welfare state.Mr. Chairman, I wish that I could sup-port the President by voting for thislegislation but unfortunately I cannot.I do not believe that this legislation isanything more than an extension of so-cialism in our country. Even if it is, assome would like us to believe, better thanour present welfare system, It Is, at themost, a poor substitute. I hope it willwork If it becomes law, but as for me Icannot support It, because I do notthink It is the answer that America needs.We need a full review of the entire wel-fare program with the intent to help theneedy\u2014including the American working-man who will be called upon to pay thebifi.Mr. MINISH. Mr. Chamnan. I rise inqualified support of HR. 18311, the Fam-ily Assistance Act of 1970. While the leg-islation contains many shortcomings andinadequacies, which I will deal with, Itdoes represent a worthwhile attempt toreorder the Nation's antiquated methodsof assistance for her less fortunate citi-zens.As a Representative from one of theNation's most highly urbanized anddensely populated areas, I have beengreatly concerned by the growing wel-fare crisis and its adverse impact uponboth welfare recipients and overbur-dened taxpayers. My home county inNew Jersey, Essex, contains less thanone-seventh of the population of theState, yet its welfare expenditures repre-sent over one-third of the statewide cost.More than a quarter of a million personsnow receive AFDC assistance In NewJersey\u201483,900 In Essex County alone.The county's welfare budget has grownfrom $3 million in 1958 to more than $17million presently. It Is clear the FederalGoemment must provide more assist-ance to those areas of the country, likeEssex County, N.J., which are strainingtheir resources and their taxpayers todeal with a problem which is actuallynational in character.Recognizing that welfare Is a nationalproblem and that substantial relief mustbe granted to those parts of the Nationwhich have assumed a disproportionateshare of the welfare burden, I introducedHR. 11374 on May 15, 1969. ThIs legis-lation would go much further than thefamily assistance plan to improve the lotof the average taxpayer and the familyon welfare. Under my measure, AFDCwould become a wholly Federal programadministered by local agencies under fed-erally prescribed terms and conditionsincluding national minisnuni standardswith the cost being fully borne by theFederal Goveimnent. The bill accepts thenational character of the welfare prob-lem and-!aces the fact that its challengecan be met most effectively and justly bythe Federal Government.The legislation before us today estab-lishes a new Federal program to replacethe aid for dependent children program.The family assistance plan would applyto all low-income persons with childrenand provides a $1,600 allowance for aCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014HOUSEfamily of four with no other income. Thefull allowance would go to persons earn-ing up to $720 per year, with subsequentbenefits cut by 50 cents for each dollarearned. Therefore, the beneficiaries willalways find themselves with a higher in-come through- employment. In contrast,the present welfare system allows for thededuction of earnings from benefits\u2014a100-percent tax.While it is true that this bill will elimi-nate the Inequity of very low benefits insome States and end the State-by-Statevariations in eligibility rules, H.R. 16311will provide little real relief to the urbanareas of our Nation so overburdened byspiraling welfare costs. A minimum floorof $1,600 for a family of four is barelyenough to cover the food budget of apoor family, and certainly not enough tocover even half the amount presentlypaid such a family by an urban Statelike New Jersey.In order to prevent a cutback fromexisting levels of assistance, the bill pro-vides that States offering benefits in ex-cess of the family assistance plan inJanuary 1970 must supplement the Fed-eral plan to the January figure or to thepoverty level, whichever is lower. TheWays and Means Committee has made asignificant improvement over the admin-istration proposal In this section. Underthe administration bill only 10 percent ofthe supplemental costs to the Stateswould be paid for by Federal assistance.The committee has increased this sup-plemental payment to 30 percent. How-ever, if the hard-pressed urban centersare to experience real relief from wel-f are costs, the Federal Government even-tually assumes 100 percent of welfarecosts.Another area of concern to me in theFamily Assistance Act involves the workand training requirements under section447 and 448. I strongly believe that awholesome home life must not be sacri-ficed and I am pleased the committee hasincluded some safeguards in- this area.A mother of a child under the age of 6 isnot required to register for training oremployment. Additionally an exclusion isprovided for the mother or other femalecaretaker of a child if there Is an adultmale related to the child in the home whodoes register. The Secretary of Health,Education, and Welfare will be requiredto provide adequate and convenient daycare for children of mothers who areundergoing work training or have beenemployed.Unfortunately, the work and trainingprovisions contain no specific minimumstandards regarding the kinds of jobs orthe levels of wages which are to be of-fered and accepted by FAP beneficiaries.The plan should be strengthened in thisarea by the formulation of explicit Fed-eral standards governing work referraland wages.In conclusion, I support the Family As-sistance Act. If enacted, it will set na-tional eligibility standards for benefits.help keep Intact the families receivingaid, provide assistance for the workingpoor, encourage initiative by allqwtng arecipient to keep a portion of his earn-ings, and provide for the first time afloor, albeit modest, under family income.113103The legislation comes to the Housefloor under the traditional closed rulefor such bills and cannot be amended bythis body. Hopefully the Senate will givecareful consideration to the points I haveraised and act to improve and strengthenthe family assistance plan.Mr. O'NEILL of Massachusetts. Mr.Chairman, I think It is of special sig-nificance that the executive heads ofthree major religious organizations havejointly endorsed and urged enactmentof H.R. 16311, the Family Assistance Actof 1970.The statement was signed by the MostReverend Joseph Bernadin, general sec..retary of the U.S. Catholic Conference;Rabbi Henry Siegman, executive vicepresident of the Synagogue Council ofAmerica, and Dr. H. R. Edwin Espy, gen-eral secretary of the National Council ofChurches\u2014Protestant and Eastern Or-thodox. They said, in part:Inintroducing th Family Assistance Plan last August, the President termed thepresent welfare system a \"colossal failure\".The present system\u2014if indeed it can becalled a system at afl\u2014disrupts families,often falls to provide minimal subsistence,demeans the recipients, reaches less thanhalf of those in need, fosters dependence andis geographically inequitable.Furthermore, under present cost-sharingprinciples,itisstraining theresources of many localities and states.The Rouse bill would move toward cor-recting some of these failures. It would setnational eligibility standards, aid familieswhile still intact, extend help for the firsttime to the working poor, encourage Initia-tive,establish a minimum Federal floor under family income and provide some fiscalrelief to states and localities.These are important steps toward makingthe system more responsive to human needsand more equitable. Furthermore, the re-quirement that able-bodied heads of house-holds register for and accept jobs or jobtraining should help shatter the myth thatthe aspirations and ambitions of the welfarerecipients somehow differ from those of therest of society.Mr. GOLDWATER. Mr. Chairman, af-ter hearing so many varied comments re-garding the proposed family assistanceplan\u2014FAP\u2014H.R. 16311, I would like tourge my colleagues to recommit the billto committee.I urge this action because I feel thatthere are many unanwered questionsabout the FAP. Some of these questionshave been raised a comprehensive re-port entiled \"Time for Change,\" a studydone by the California counties welfaremodernization task force. Speaking ofthe PAP, the report states:It Is Impossible to determine the net fis-cal effect on either the state or the countiesof California. The Federal Department ofHealth. Education and Welfare baa esti-mated that California would have realizeda net savings of $107 million, based on 1968cost and caseloaddata.Discussion withHEW officials indicates that in making theseestimates they did not consider earned in-come exemptions, work and training ex-pense allowances, or administrative coats.Hence, we believe that the figure is ques-tionable.I would like, at this time, to summarizesome of the other questions raised in thereport and say that I do not necessarilyagree or disagree with some of the impli-cations of the criticisms, but merly off et 113104 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEApril 15,19.70them as proof that there are many un-answered questions about the FAP.The report charges that one of the\"most serious deficiencies\" in the FAPIs the continuation of State programs tosupp1ement Federal payments. The re-quirement of a State supplemental pro-gram continues the inequities which nowexist in the present AFDC program.If a major reason for establishing a fed-eral plan of family assistance is the wideunpopularity of the present AFDC programand its inquitlee\u2014Says the report.\u2014There Is no justification for making itmandatory to continue the program under adifferent name.The report further .states that theproblems of operating a supplemental as-sistance program would be \"an admin-istrative nightmare.\"Cost: The disadvantages are that noone knows what the new FAP will costor what the cost of the State supple-mental program will be. For the Stateto contract with the Federal Govern-ment means a loss of State and local con-trol of a program involving a great dealof money. It continues the inequitiesof the difference In payment levels be-tween States.The working poor: Although the work-ing poor are Included in the Federal pro-gram, they are not included in the sup-plemental program. These families arealso excluded from medical benefits. Forthe iiarg1nal worker this means a cha-otic economic situation In which he vail-ous]y qualifies for and loses supplemen-tal benefits and medical care.There would be a strong incentive to seekthe security of being unemployed or onlypartially employed\u2014Says the report.Work incentives: The report notes thatthe PAP requires registration for em-ployment as a requisite for receiving as-sistance, but that this is nothing new.California and several other States havehad such a requirement for years. Underthe FAP, there Is also a penalty loss ofbenefits equal to the benefits of only oneperson. The report says:We now have this and It has proven lesseffective as a 4evloe for controlling be-havior and attitudes than the former policyof termination of total assistance to thefamily.California Is not the only State withserious reservations about the FAP. Arandom telephone check by my office hasrevealed that there are several otherswho also feel that there are many un-answered questions.Mr. Morris Priebatch, chief of ad-ministration and planning for the Mis-sissippi State Department of Public Wel-fare, feels that the FAP definitely Is alarge step toward a guaranteed income.Re also feels that the estimates of howmany working poor will qualify underthe new program have been greatlyunderestimated. He told my office:There are a lot of unanswered questionsabout this program. I think the total costsare going to be a lot higher than theestimates.New York's Deputy Commissioner ofPublic Welfare. George W. Chesbro, ad-dressing himself to the work trainingaspects of the FAP, said that of thetotal 1,300,000 people on welfare in NewYork, only 6 percent, or 82,000 are em-ployable. Of these 82,000, he said 42,000are now employed. The other 40,000areemployable, he noted, but are unskilledand could only work at low-paying jobs.Jobs which, I might add, would mostlikely not be deemed \"suitable\" underthe provisions of the FAP.Harold Strode, director of social wel-fare for the State of Nebraska, summedup his feeling about the FAP with asimple\u2014We don't know if the state can afford It.Strode said that he strongly supportedthe concept of a pilot program on theFAP before national implementation. Headvised:We should look at what happened toMedicare.As for the idea of getting people offwelfare rolls and onto payrolls, Strodesaid that In Nebraska, only four-tenthsof 1 percent of welfare recipients aretrainable for new jobs.Texas commissioner of social welfare,Burton Hackney, was very outspoken inhis criticism of the FAP:We were told the PAP could save Texas $73million, but our figures now indicate that itwould cost the state an additional $18 mil-lion ... weare not going to kid ourselvesabout opening up the welfare rolls to othercategories. Nobody knows the effect the add-ing of the worklngpoor will have on the sizeof the welfare rolls. It l going to cost. Themost expensive coat of the welfare is medicalcare. Who Is going to pay fOr this additionalcost? There are a lot of unanswered ques-tions?Denver White, director of social wel-fare for the State of Ohio, also had hisdoubts about the FAP:It's too diMcult to determine what theeffect adding the working poor to the wel.fare rolls will have. Our real concern ishow to evaluate the costs of putting thesepeople on welfare.On work incentives and how the WINprogram has worked in Ohio, White said:We can't brag about our success. It did nottake off as well as It could have, even thoughwe had some success.Again the medical care issue wasraised when White said:When other states put the medically indi-gent on the government programs. . . many problems were caused because of unsoundfinancing. Our concern is that this does nothappen under the PAP.Assistant to the director of public wel-fare In Missouri, John Plet, voiced simi-lar criticisms and raised similar ques-tions; reservations about who adminis-ters the program, how medical care fig-ures In the FAP and what happens tosocial services programs.Thus, it Is clear from the survey bymy office of various State welfare offi-cials, that while they may differ as tohow the problem of welfare should behandled, they are all in agreement thatthey simply do not know enough aboutthe PAP at this point.It Is because of these reasons that Iurge my colleagues to i'ecommlt thefamily assistance plan, H.R. 1631r, tocommittee.Mr. BOLAND. Mr. wel-fare system In the United States vergeson chaos.It Is a bewildering patchwork of laws\u2014laws that vary region byregion, Stateby State, community by community.Welfare payments in some areas\u2014thetidelands of Mississippi, for example, orthe mountain country of West Vir-ginia\u2014are so heartbreakingly small thatpoor families live with hunger everyday of their lives.In other areas\u2014New York City comesto mind as a striking example\u2014pay-ments have steadily risen to astonish-ingly high levels.Yet these very same payments, interms of actual benefits to the poor, stilllag far behind what most people wouldconsider even a minimum standard ofliving. But, to the rural poor, both whiteand black, such payments appear enor-mous.They are virtually streaming into ournorthern cities in a futile search for abetter way of life. Their hopes, of course,are dashed at once.They exchange a country shack for aghetto slum, a diet of tirled rice andbeans for one of packaged rice andcanned beans.The migration from the countryside tothecity has helped turn our innercities Into teeming slums. It has helpedbreed the crime, the dope addiction, thestreet rebellions now making headlinesthroughout the United States.Another problem In our welfare sys-tem\u2014perhaps the greatest problem ofall\u2014is its tendency to discourage work.Even the most piddling earned in-come disqualifies most people from re-ceiving welfare payments. As a result,many of the poor shun jobs.Why, a young man might ask, shouldI wash dishes for $60 a week when I canget $55 for doing nothing?The Congress can show him why today.The bill now before us promises toclear away most of the problems nowhampering our welfare system.First, the bill would set national mini-mum standards for welfare payments\u2014standards that would give all welfare re-cipients a comparable living standardand stop the migration into our cities.Second,thebdllwould encouragework by allowing poor families a slidingscale of welfare benefits as their earnedIncome increases or decreases. It wouldalways pay\u2014and pay relatively well\u2014to have a job.Third, the bill would literally compelpeople on welfare to take jobs or jobtraIning.This legislation is much more thanjust another welfare bill.It is a work bill, and it is high time theCongress passed it.Mr. MILLS. Mr. Chairman, would theChair be kind enough to advise at thispointto the time remaining for bothsides In general debate?The CHAIRMAN The majority hasremainIng 1 hour and 25 mInutes. ThereIs remaIning 1 hour and 48 minutes forthe minority.Mr. MILLS. Together that is as muchas 3 hours or more. April 15,1970CONGRESSIONALRECORD\u2014HOUSE H3105The CHAmMAN. The Chair advisesthe gentleman from Arkansas that thereis a total of 3 hours and 15 minutes re-maining.Mr. MILLS. Mr. Chairman, in view ofthat fact, It is quite evident to me thatwe will not be able to complete all gen-eral debate and have a vote on the billon final passage as early tomorrow after-noon as I had hoped to be the case. Ihad told many Members that I was hope-ful we could have the vote by not 1atezthan 2 o'clock. However, it now looksas if It might be later than that. We donot intend to use any further time thisafternoon.Mr. Chairman, in view of these cir-cumstances, I move that the Committeedo now rise.The motion was agreed to.Accordingly the Committee rose; andthe Speaker pro tempore (Mr. ALBERT)having assumed the chair, Mr. DINGELL,Chairman of the Committee of the WholeHouse on the State of the Union. re-ported that that Committee, having hadunder consideration the bill (H.R. 16311)to authorize a family assistance planproviding basic benefits to low-Incomefamilies with children, to provide incen-tives for employment and training toImprove the capacity for employment ofmembers of such families. to achievegreateruniformityoftreatmentof recipients under the Federal-State pub-lic assistance programs and to otherwiseimprove such programs, and for otherpurposes, had come to no resolutionthereon. April 16, 1970 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014 HOUSE H 3145 H.R. 16311\u2014THE NEW WELFAREPROGRAM(Mr. FOREMAN asked and was givenpermission to address the House for 1minute and to revise and extend his re-marks and Include extraneous matter.) H 3146Mr. FOREMAN. Mr. Speaker, I havesome very serious reservations about H.R.16311, the guaranteed annual wage wel-fare program. Admittedly, the presentwelfare program is costly and inequita-ble\u2014however, I believe this bill wouldmove us in the wrong direction becauseit will probably add several million morepersons to the welfare rolls, more socialworkers, more Federal control, bureauc-racy, and dependence at an estimated ad-ditional annual taxpayer cost of $4 billionor more than we are now spending. Ourobjective should be to seek a reduction,not an increase, of overloaded welfarerolls. We should work to reduce the costand control of government by the enact-ment of programs that encourage ir,di-vidual work, Incentive, and responsibil-ity\u2014not reward nonproductivity and ir--responsibility. We need to work towardmore jobs and permanent job securityrather than permanent relief.Welfare was originally designed as amethod to aid people who were sick, dis-abled, or temporarily in need\u2014however,it has gradually come to be regarded as ameans of bringing about a more nearlyequal distribution of income\u2014and thisis a most serious threat to individualinitiative and excellence. This new pro-gram violates the basic principles of in-dividualIncentive,responsibility, andfree enterprise that have built this greatcountry.This country has always been a work-,propcrty-, and incentive-oriented soci-etlr\u2014and it should continue to .be. MostAmericans who wOrk for their livir(g havelittle sympathy for the concept that everyman should be guaranteed an income bythe Government regardless of whether hecan or will work. A Federal Governmentguaranteed annual Income will destroyself-reliance,individualresponsibility,self-respect, and the incentive to work.Therefore, in good conscience, I can-not support or vote for this program thatI sincerely believe can eventually de-stroy the moral fiber of the United Statesof America.FAMILY ASSISTANCE ACT OF 1970Mr. MILLS. Mr. Speaker, I move thatthe House resolve Itself into the Com-mittee of the Whole House on the Stateof the Union for the further considera-tion of the bill (H.R. 16311) to author-ize a family assistance plan providingbasic benefits to low-Income familieswith children, to provide Incentives foremployment and training to improve thecapacity for employment of members ofsuch families, to achieve greater uni-formity of treatment of recipients underthe Federal-State public assistance pro-grams and to otherwise improve suchprograms, and for other pl4rposes.The motion was agreed to.I THECOMMITIEEOP THE WhOLEAccordingly the House resolved itselfinto the Committee of the Whole Houseon the State of the Union for the furtherconsideration of the bill H.R. 16311, wIthM. DINGELL in the chair. -TheClerk read the title of the bill.The CHAIRMAN. When the Commit-tee rose on yesterday, the gentlemanfrom Arkansas (MrMILLs) had 1 hourCONGRESSIONAL ECORD \u2014 HOUSEand 25 minutes remaining, and the gen-tleman from Wisconsin (Mr. BYRNES)had 1 hour and 48 minutes remaining.The Chair recognizes the' gentlemanfrom Arkansas (Mr. MILLs).Mr. MILLS. Mr. Chairman, I ampleased to yield 10 minutes to tI'e Irise In support of the President's bill onwelfare.I feel that it is an amendment that Islong overdue. I would like for you to lookat it for just a moment from a differentview than others have taken.At the present time, one of the h\u00e8avi-est burdens that rests upon your Stateor your city has been placed there by theFederal Government\u2014anditisthe burden of welfare. This is the thing thatis destroying most of America's cities.As that tax burden on property becomesheavier and heavier to pay these welfarecosts, more and more people move outof the city and more businesses move out.If there were no other reason for votingfor this bill, the proper reason for votingfor itis that welfare should not restupon the property In cities or In States,but it should be paid for by the FederalGovernment out of the General Treas-ury of the United States.This is the burden of every person, notmerely the burden of those who live in aspecific area. The Federal Government isin the best position to pay and the Fed-eral Government should pay.I will admit that under this bill theywill not pay the full bill, but I am surethe day will come when this burden willbe taken off the taxpayers in the variousStates as a State tax and placed whereit properly belongs.I would like to tell you some of thethings that I think are wrong with thebill and that I think should be correctedand I am sure will be corrected.In the first place, this bill pays only Ifyou have a child. I think that Is a mis-take. I think that the poor, the single poorand the married childless poor should bepaid also. I think it is an error to payonly If there is a child. But I am sure thisproblem will be taken up In later Con-gresses and corrected. I think addition-ally It is a mistake to say that a womancan stay at home as long as she has achild under 6. I do not believe the societygives her a choice. I think the social work-ers make that choice, and I think this wasproved in the WIN program In New YorkCity, where they found that few womenwere able to go out and work, and at theend of the year I believe they had train-ed 106 women. I think the social work-ers make that choice. I think most ofthese women want to work and they canwork and they are anxious to do so.But they have to be given an opportunityto work.I would like to explain also anotheramendment that I offered to this billwhich was not accepted. I hope thatamendment will be placed in the bill overIn the Senate. I feel that a teenage girlwho becomes pregnant should be re-quired to continue In school after theAvril 16,1970birth of the child, or should be givenfurther training.I would like to explain to you that inNew Haven, Conn., a survey was'made of100 girls who had left school because ofpregnancies. At the end of 5 years, 387children had been born to those 100.girls.That is almost a baby per year. In NewYork they then selected 100 girls whowere pregnant. They gave them all kindsof assistance. They gave them additionaltraining, ahd at the end of 2 years only11 children had been born. There is noperson in our society on whom a' greaterburden is going to be placed than theteenage girl who bears a child, and weare money ahead if we aid her to supportherself and her child.The CHAIRMAN. The Committee willrise Informally in order that the Housemay receive a message. FAMILY ASSISTANCE ACT OF 1970The Committee resumed Its sitting.The CHAIRMAN. When the Commit-tee rose informally to receive the mes-sage, the gentlewoman from Michiganhad the floor. The gentlewoman will pro-ceed.Mrs. GRIFFITHS. I would like to othtout again that while I do not believe thisbillIs perfect, a good start has beenmade. In every State in this Union therewill be some saving to the local taxpayers.But this Is the only possible remedy thatlocal taxpayers Oan ever look forward toas saving their homes literally from con-demnation to take over this welfareburden.In the State of Massachusetts alone thewelfare burden Is the equivalent of 25percent of the State budget. I repeat toeach Member that this burden did notcome from Massachusetts. It is not ex-clusively their fault that these people areon welfare. Some of them came fromother States. They came there of courselooking for work. But in my opinion wel-fare Is a national responsibility. It Is notthe burden of a locality, and this Is notthe way it should be handled.I congratulate the President. I feel hehas offered a good first step. I urge everyperson to vote for this bill before hisown community Is destroyed.Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin. Mr. Chair-man, I yield 10 minutes to the gentlemanfrom Iowa (Mr. GRoss).(Mr. GROSS asked and was given per-mission to revise and extend his re-marks.)Mr. GROSS. Mr. Chairman, I have lis-tened with Interest to the gentlewomanfrom Michigan. I certainly agree withher that the tax burdens of the Statesand local communities are onerous, but April 16,1P70Ido not agree with her premise that theFederal Government is in better shape tosolve all the problems of the States andlocal subdivisions of government. I can-not recall when the the Federal Govern-ment last had a balanced budget. It hasbeen running deficits as high as $20 bil-lion a year, piling up the Federal debtuntil It now approaches $385 billion. No,I cannot subscribe to the theory that theFederal Government is in better shape totake care of the problems of the entirebody politic, including the entire welfaresystem of this country.I regret the gentleman from ArkansasMr. MILLS), the sponsor of this bill, isnot here because I wanted to address aquestion or two to him.In the first place, I am getting all kindsof figures as to the real cost of this bill.Some say It Is $4,400,000,000 more thanIs already on welfare. I wonder if thegentleman from Wisconsin could help.me with this. I have talked with otherWays and Means Committee membersand they have given me other figures,running to niuch higher totals than $4'/bjllion. I would appreciate it if the gentle-man could tell us what this bill wouldcost in addition to what we are nowspending for welfare.I yield to the gentleman from Wis-consin.Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin. Mr. Chair-man, if the gentleman will refer to thecommittee report, on page 53, he will seethat we Included a table projecting Fed-eral costs for the first year of operation.For that year, 1971, the basic payments of$1,600 per family, plus the 30 percentmatching of State supplements, wouldtotal $4.6 billion.Existing legislation\u2014that Is, the Fed-eral share of AFDC\u2014would call for a costthat year of $2.5 billion. So the additionalcost, as far as that aspect of the programis concerned, Is the difference between$4.6 and $2.5 billion, or $2.1 billion. Thatis the difference between 1971 costs of theAFDC program\u2014aid to families with de-pendent children\u2014and the cost thatwould be Incurred under the family as-sistance program.If we are dealing in dollars and cents,the Cost difference Involving that part ofthe program on which we have had mostdebate .Isthis difference between $4.6billion and $2.5 billion.The gentleman may get confused\u2014and it Is understandable\u2014on the overallcost of the bill, because in addition tothe family assistance changes, we arechanging the cost of what we call theadult assistance category; that is, ourassistance to tile aged,-to the blind, andto the disabled.Under the new bill, the Federal shareof adult assistance fl be $2.7 billion.That cost today 1 $2 billion. So therewill be an increase of $700 million inthat category.If we combine the costs of those twofacets of the bill\u2014the one Which Is morecontroversial and the one which appar-ently Is not so controversial\u2014the totalcost under the legislation will be $7.3billion.The total cost of the present legisla-'tton, projected on a full year basis, Is $4.5billion. So there will b\u00eb.-azi increase ofCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014HOUSE$2.8 billion for the first year under thenew bill.Mr. GROSS. Then the figure whIchsomeone gave yesterday\u2014Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin. That fig-ure I mentiOned Is the cash outlay. Ishould add that there will be training,day care, and administrative costs, whichcould account for another $900 million.So the total comes to $3.7 billion, so faras the basic change In cost under thisbill is concerned.I also should call the gentleman's at-tention\u2014so that he has a proper per-spective on. this situation\u2014to the pro-jections of the costs of the current pro-gram, and of the proposed legislation be-yond 1971. Those figures are also shownin the table on page 53, and It is note-worthy that by 1975, accordIng to theseprojections, the cost difference betweenthis bill and the current program woulddrop from $2.8 billion to $1.1 billion. Andmuch of this added sum would be recap-tured, hopefully, as more and more wel-fare recipents turn from welfare rolls topayrolls.Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Chairman, willthe gentleman yield?Mr. GROSS. I yield briefly to the gen-tleman from Pennsylvania.Mr. WILLIAMS. I should like to sabrthat the total additional cost of the so-called family assistance plan is beyondcalculation at this time, because there isgoing to be a new department set up inHEW to handle the administration ofthis plan. Today, no ofle knows howmany people are going to be needed tostaff that new department.In addition to that, this bill providesfor the recovery of any money fraudu-lently collected from the Government. Inmy opinion this is going to mean almosta doubling of the size of our presentJustice Department.Mr. GROSS. Does the gentleman havea total figure for that?Mr. WILLIAMS. No. In spite of myefforts to get some concrete figures onthe amount of personnel which will benecessary to administer this law, I havebeen unable to get any figures.Mr.-GROSS. I thank both the gentle-men for their remarks. The gentlemanfrom Pennsylvania points up the utteruncertainty as to cost.Mr. COLMER.. Mr. Chairman, will thegentleman yield to me on that particularsubject?Mr. GROSS. I am always pleased toyield to my friend, the gentleman fromMississippi.Mr. COLMER. I asked the gentlemanto yield not because I have any exper-tise on the matter, or any accurate fig-ures. I tried to listen to the testimony ofthe various advocates as well as the op..ponents of this proposal before the Com-niittee on Rules. I can safely say thatthere was no testimony which placedthe additional cost of this program overthe present program at less than $4.5billion. Some of the estimates ran muchhigher.There was a general consensus thatthe minimum was $4.5 billion and that itwas almost Impossible to get any accu-rate figures.Mr. GROSS. I thank the distinguishedH 3147chairman of the Rules Committee forthat contribution, because that Is theminimal figure which was given hereyesterday. Yet, others say the add-oncost of this bill may well be above $6billion. I am just trying to get some kindof firm answer and again I am disap-pointed that the chairman of the Waysand Means Committee Is absent. As thesponsor of this socialistic legislation, heshould be able to provide specific costfigures as well as inform the Housewhere the revenue is to be obtained tomeet the spending of additional billions.Now, the chairman of the committee(Mr. MILLS) has been widely quoted inthe newspapers as saying that if thebase of $1,600 is Increased in the otherbody he will divorce himself from sup-port of the bill. I wish he had remainedon the floor so that I might ascertainwhether this is correct.I address a question to the gentlemanfrom Wisconsin (Mr. BYRNE5)as to whether he is going to go to the otherbody, if this bill passes, and agree toan increase in the base figure of $1,600.Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin. Will thegentleman yield?Mr. GROSS. Yes. I gladly yield to thegentleman.Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin. The chair-man of. the committee and I agreed, notonly between ourselves,but publiclythrough an announcement before theRules Committee that we were hold.ing\u2014and that we would hold\u2014to theceiling of $1,600. We said that was ourlimit, and that if the other body sawfit to go beyond that, they would facethe same situation they faced on a fewother occasions: We would just refuseto go to conference and there would beno legislation. I have not changed myopinion on that, and I believe I am atliberty to say that I am not advised bythe chairman that he has changed hisopinion. I am sure, if he had, he wouldhave let me know.Mr. GROSS. I am glad to have theanswer from the ranking minority mem-ber of the committee, but I well recallwhat happened when the bill, extendingcertain excise taxes, was sent to the Sen-ate. It was understood then, and withoutqualification, that members of the HouseWays and Means Committee would notpermit the Senate to write tax legisla-tion by inserting In the excise bill a 10-percent surtax. As Members of the Housewell know the Senate initiated that sur-tax legislation and the House confereesaccepted It. But even at $1,600, the doorto guaranteed annual income and fullblown socialism has been opened.Mr. Chairman, passage of this legisla-tion will put a premium on the produc-tion of more illegitimate children andencourage indolence on the part oil thosewho have no desire to work. And theadded billions of cost will mean eitherhigher taxes or more borrowing, moredebt, deficit, and inflation.I cannot support this legislation In Itspresent form even though I agree thatreorganization of welfare Is overdue. Neither President Nixon nor the Waysand Means Committee had to go to thislength to attain the result of reorga-nization and coordination. H3148The CHAIRMAN. The time of the gen-tleman from Iowa has expired.Mr. FULTON of Tennessee. Mr. Chair-man, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlemanfrom Texas (Mr. BURLESON).(Mr. BURLESON of Texas asked andwas given permission to revise and extendhis remarks.)Mr. BURLESON of Texas. Mr. Chair-man, there have been some very ablespeeches made on this subject today andyesterday. Our able and distinguishedchairman of the Ways and Means Com-mittee and the ranking minority mem-ber, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.BYRNES) were very convincing In pre-senting the case for the measure beforeus.This whole proposal Is convincing Intheory. It sounds so good on the surface.But I remember In 1962 and In 1967what happened. As a matter of fact,looking at child welfare, it started in1935. This Is no new program. However,In 1962 and 1967 the able chairman ofthe Committee on Ways and Means andthe gentleman from Wisconsin, the rank-ing minority member, just like the vastmajority of you, sold me on It and I votedfor It on the proposition that \"You aregoing to take people off of the welfarerolls and put them on the payrolls.\"And here we are again today with thesame slogans and cliches. You know, in-cidentally there is a remarkable thingabout this whole business. If this hadbeen proposed during the Kennedy ad-mInistration or the Johnson administra-tion, there would have been holes In thetop of this ceiling right over here on theRepublican side of the aisle. You knowthat as well as I do.Now, several have inquired as to thecost of this program. Why, I say to you,there Is nobody who can tell you the costof It. We are going to be back In herebefore too long to ask you to raise thedebt limit, and If we have any IntegrityIn the Federal Government, we are goingto be back here asking you to raise taxes.And people just got through paying themlast night. There Is no one who can tellyou what this program Is ultimately go-ing to cost as a matter of fact there isno clear estimate of what the additionalcost will be for the first year.They talk about training. Why wehave a training program on every cornerIn all the Federal programs already ineffect Here Is a list of them.I think thee are nine or 10 trainingand retraining programs, and now It Isproposed to create one bigger than anyof them. Here they are. There are sixpages of training programs under man-power training programs which comeout of the Committee on Education andLabor and those programs which comeout of the Committee on Interstate andForeign Commerce as well as the Com-mittee on Ways and Means. There is nouse of my reading them, but look at themand you will find all sorts of other suchprograms. In addition, this bill providesfor the creation of another WPA andany other make-work programs whichthe Federal Government may devise.Now, Mr. Chairman, we say we aregoing to train people to get off the wel-fare rolls and onto the payroll. How goodCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEIt sounds. However, do not be misled. Weare going down the road of. no return.This is just a start. Have you seen Fed-eral programs of this kind shrink?Talk about a guaranteed annual in-come? I heard my good friend, the gen-tlcinan from Wisconsin (Mr. BYRNES),say yesterday that we already have one.But, at least, there is some judgment ex-ercised on the part of welfare workersand others who carry on the presentprogram\u2014they have some judgment anddiscretion as to who goes on it, but thisprogram puts people on welfare auto-matically. About all they have to do isconsent. The Supreme Court just a fewdays ago ruled that once on welfare a re-cipient cannot be removed until and un-less a Federal court rules on the ques-tion.Mr. Chairman, a family of four hasbeen used In the report on this bill andas an example in most of this debate.There are many families In this countrywho have more than two children. Thereare many families of seven, eight, nine,and 10 who will qualify under this pro-gram. Face it\u2014you know and I knowthat these size families are likely to bethose who are more likely to qualify.The wage earner In that family wouldbe having to make almost $8,000 a year,or else It would be more beneficial If theywent on this program. Where Is the in-centive in these conditions?Mr. Chairman, great emphasis has beenplaced on training and retraining underthe provisions of this proposal. Underthis program a man can say, \"I will goto work if it is a job located at a distanceof not more than 1 mile, but if it is 2miles, that Is too far.\"There Is no definition of \"suitable\"employment. You cannot tell what itmeans, One thing we could do, however,is to send this bill back to the Commit-tee on Ways and Means. Everyone seem-ingly agrees that the present program isa failure. This being the case, surely ourcommittee will be willing to take actiontoward corrections.The present program has been referredto as.a \"mess,\" and that I can agree with.I am just thankful, but it is of little con-solation to me, that I have not been apart of it. I have not been a part of theGreat Society's relief programs. There-fore, I am free to say about this one thatit will be a mess, too. So, we are going tocut off our nose to cure our sinus. ThatIs about what It amounts to. We are goingto put one failure on top of another.With reference to the motion t re-commit this bill, It will probably containlanguage to change a word or two, but tobe reported back \"forthwith,\" will bemeaningless.Mr. Chairman, It, is not going to makeany difference whether we have a motionto recommit. It will be pretty tough tovote against this bill because It has in-creased the adult benefits and with thatI agree. Inflation, for which the Federalis largeW responsible, In my judgment, iscausing hardship on people In this cate-gory.Mr. Chairman, I propose, if the situ-ation permits, to offer a motion at theappropriate time to strike the enactingclause and give to the members of theApril 16, 1970committee a straight vote on this meas-ure. I believe if such a motion is adoptedthe Ways and Means Committee canbring you something much better thanwhat is offered to you today.Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin. Mr. Chair-man, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlemanfrom Alabama (Mr. DICKINSON).(Mr. DICKINSON asked and was givenpermission to revise and extend his re-marks.)Mr. DICKINSON. Mr. Chairman, Ithank the gentleman from Wisconsinfor yielding. If I may have the gentle-man's 'attention I would like to propounda question to the gentleman, If it hasnot been answered already in the brieftime I was away from the floor. If I mayhave the attention of either the rankingminority member on my side or the pro-ponents of the legislation on the otherside, as I understand it, at least, this Isdesigned to keep families together andto keep the husband at home where hecan live up to his responsibilities.But, is there anything contained in.this bill that would keep a family fromsplitting up, whether It be done by offi-cial act such as a divorce decree or byseparation and the husband leaves tak-ing with him two of the children andleaving three of them with his wife. Willthey both become eligible if both of themset up two diffrent units or householdsand receive payment for these two sepa-rate households?Would this be possible under this bill,or is there a prohibition against that?Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin. Mr. Chair-man, If the gentleman will yield, we donot prohibit it this as such. But If theyestablish two homes they will have moreexpense than the amount of additionalassistance they would receive under theprovisions of this bill.Let me also call the attention of thegentleman to 'the fact that there is anentirely new concept written into thisbill which is not in the current law con-cerning the financial responsibility of thefather to support their families. He cannot avoid this financial responsibility bymoving Into a separate household or outof the State. Under this law there Is aresponsibility of this father to the Fed-eral Government. The Federal Govern-ment says any money that we pay outunder this program for the benefit of yourchildren or your wife Is a charge that wehave against you. We can collect thisdirectly or we can withhold funds to youat any time by the Federal Government torecoup what we have paid out on behalfof your children and wife.We do not say that poor people haveto live under the same roof, but we dosay to the fathers that you cannot avoidyour financial responsibility to your f am-jly by failing to do so. We do not rely onthe law as It is today, I would say tothe gentleman from Alabama, to enforcethrough a local agency the father's obli-gation to support. This now becomes aFederal matter, a Federal responsibility,and a responsibility of the parent to theFederal Government.Mr. DICKINSON. I would like to say\u2014and I thank the gentleman for his an-swer, and .1 hope that It will work, be-cause If it does It will certainly be re- April 16,1970freshlng.But after over 8 years as ajudge of the domestic relations court andjuvenile court, and based on my personalexperience, itis my opinion that youmay well have a family split and aclaim of part of the children both ways.There Is no provision to keep checkingon these people to see that they, afterthey haveestablishedthisbasisof living separately, do not move back intothe same house, stay under the sameroof, sleep in the same bed as husbandand wife\u2014because they do not have tobe divorced\u2014and how do we police this?How do we guard against it, and whatInakes it certain that it will not comeabout under the provisions of this bill?The CHAIRMAN. The time of thegentleman has expired.Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin. Mr. Chair-man, I yield 1 additional minute to thegentleman from Alabama. I do so forthe purpose of asking the gentlemanfrom his experience if he has not foundthat one of the real problems that wehave had Is the lack of enforcement ofresponsibility on the parents toward thesupport of their children?Mr. DICKINSON. Absolutely.Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin. And doesnot the gentleman think that we havemade a good step forward where we ha-pose a subrogation, in the sense that theFederal Oovernment Is able to go againstthis individual for any funds that UncleSam has paid out in his regard?Mr. DICKINSON. I would say to thegentleman that I think it is fine In the-ory, but It just Is not workable underthe Uniform Reciprocal Support Act.Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin. That iswhy we made it a Federal offense, be-cause the Reciprocal State Act, as thegentleman well knows, depends on oneState getting the permission of anotherState, whereas in this case a Federalagent moves In, and there is no need ofgetting permission from a State.Mr. DICKINSON. Who is the Federalagent who Is going to move In? That iswhat I do not understand as to how thiscmbe enforceable.-Do we have a cadre,a police group that goes aroun1 enforc-ing this, or does each agency have somany enforcers and investigators?Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin. The Fed-eral Government will put the responsi-bility, as far as turning over these casesIs concerned, up to the proper prosecu-tors, which would be Federal, and to theSecretary of Health, Education, andWelfare, which has paid out the money.Say you have some. money that you paidout. You paid it out in behalf of Mr.Jones for his children. You find Mr.Jones and prosecute him.The CHAIRMAN. The time of the gen-tleman has again expired.Mr, BYRNES of Wisconsin. Mr. Chair-man, I yield 1 additional minute to tilegentleman from Alabama.Mr. Chairman, let me also call the at-tention of the gentleman from Alabamato this case of splitting up. If the familywants to live together, then there is aresponsibility on the part of the fatherto reg1ster We do not -insist that theyboth register.Now, there are some critics who saythat both the husband and wife shouldCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEbe required to register. That is not re-quired In this particular case, where thetwo are living together. But once theyseparate, once they start two differenthouseholds, then both the male livingover in one household has to register, andthe woman living In the other householdhas to register. And they must do morethan register\u2014they have to take jobs, sothey will both go to work under this cir-cumstance, and maybe we would savemoney in the long run if we. had bothpeople working.Mr. DICKINSON. I thank the gentle-man for his explanation.Just let me say, I have heard the previ-ous speaker in the well, the gentlemanfrom Texas, and I wish I had said whathe said because to me he summed it upvery aptly and very ably. I believe In ev-erything he said and I subscribe to hisstatement.I talked with my welfare director athome and he says that this present planwill cost the State $9 million more thanit Ispresentlyhaving to pay.According to my director, if we areforced to match what will be available in1971 we will be forced to spend $9 mil-lion more to match the Federal portion.Whether this is so or not, I do not know,but I do know this\u2014no one knows e-actly what it Is going to cost. It is anotherlayer on top of a layer, and I hope every-one who votes for this 11111 will vote forIt with the firm conviction and in thesure knowledge that you are going tohave to vote a tax increase to pay forthis. If you are not willing to vote for atax increase, then do not vote for thisbill.The CHAIRMAN. The time of the gen-tleman has expired.Mr. FULTON of Tennessee. Mr. Chair-man, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlemanfrom Pennsylvania (Mr. D!NT).(Mr. DENT asked and was given per-mission to revise and extend his re-marks.)Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I votedagainst the rule.Last night I tried to read what I couldon this legislation and I made a decisionthat is not one I normally make. Butthis being the kind of legislation\u2014and Iwait to vote for some kind of legIslationdealing with problems in this Importantarea, I decided that If there is a votethat will send it back to the committeemeaningfully so that we can have anopportunity to look at it, I am going tovote for that motion.Failing in that, then I am going tovote for the bill on final passage in thehope that I will get another look at itand will get an opportunity to present myviews to the Senate.First of all, the view that I take cfthis Is that it steps into an area that Iam not so sure the Committee on Waysand Means has the expertise to discussand present to the House, without someconsideration beIng given to what theyare doing.There are In America today about 1mJ.lliozi Americans who are not coversby the minimum wage law. Automati-cally\u2014and I studied this all night, I amas positive about this as I.ani of the factthat I am standing up here\u2014automati-H 3149cally will be put under annual wages, out-side of a single person, one not withouta family. You are actually covering 13.million Americans at a rate of yearlyminimum wages\u2014I mean a rate of mini-mum pay wage that is above anythingthat we even try to put through this Con-gress or intended to try to put throughthis year for a worker to receive.A worker in the $3,000 class which isroughly the minimum wage in Americatoday, and the highest payment underthe family allowance for a worker In thefamily of 4 group. If he'has n.o chil-dren at all or just has a wife or it is thecase of a wife with a child, they wouldreceive\u2014that wife with a child\u2014wOuldreceive $160 above the minimum wage.How\u00e8ver carrying that through\u2014thefour examples that I personally got thismorning from the four girls who cleanoffices\u2014the smallest family in that groupwas six and the largest was nine. In afamily of nine, in addition to that girl'spay, It would amount to an added $2,560of $5,260 total pay.How can I, as chairman of the Com-mittee on Minimum Wage, attempt tocome before this Congress with any kindof sensible and reasonable minimumwage bill, not considering a man work-ing full time under a positive pay plan,without considering his family?You are now at this time, at this stageof our history, and I want it clearly un-derstood, I hope you know what youare doing, and It may be the right thingto do. I have the greatest faith in andI have the greatest friendship for thechairman of this committee. I know hewould not deliberately upset every unioncontract In the country and yet he maywell do this if a large number of workersare added to the work force under thisact.The rate of pay under the union con-tracts Is based upon the classificationof a job and not upon the number ofmembers in the family.If you are basing it upon the numberof members in a family, you find yourselfin a position where men working along-side each other, doing exactly the sameclassification of job, will be earning thesame set rate of pay, because that Is theclassification of that job under eitherunion contract or individual job place-ment.But if the employee happens to havea large family, he will receive moremoney for the work he performs. Theonly difference Is that it will not cost theproducer any more mcn'. We shall nowstart again on the never-ending road ofsubsidy Of the production of goods Inthis country. Every farm helper InAmerica will receive a minimum pay un-der this bill greater than we have everbeen able to give them.It took 30 years\u2014and during some 18of those years I have been at the fore-front of the battle\u2014to cover every work-er in America under new wage laws. Wehadto go to the far extreme of t'''the largest farms on a limited numbsof days of work to pass the most mini-mal pay of $1 an hour, reaching to $1.25in 1971, Fthzai 1. But this auto-matically changes it, and theonIy aresthat your Committee -on General Labo H 3150can function In dealing with the mini-mum wage will be In that area of In-come for an Individual or a man andwife living together. It is only In thatarea. This bill is based upon the premisethat more manpower training Is goingto create more jobs. Let me tell all ofyou right now that what most of us donot understand Is that the greater bulkof the number of persons on permanentrelief in this country are unemployablepersons. Studies reveal, if you will lookinto the matter, that the average workyear In America encompasses 210 daysof work. Persons today with large enougha family who are making as much as$2.40 an hour will fInd themselves draw-ing a supplement.Do you know that the average wage,under contract, of textile workers InAmerica is $2.40 an hour? Do you knowthat the average wage of the clothingworkers and garment workers is only25 to 50 cents above the minimum wage?You will be e'ablishing for the firsttime in the history of our Nation a newbase for the payment of labor, and Iremind youof the warning given manyyears ago that when you get Into this.type of legislation, keep in mind thatthe minimum becomes the maximum.The maximum becomes the minimum.I Just came back from Mexico. I wentdown there to spend 2 days on my own tolook into the PronelY Territory. 'iftythousand Jobs had moved over into thatterritory In 2 years and 7 months. Therewere no training programs, and everyone of those Industries will tellyou that Inthe UnitedStates,Ifthey do not have manpower training pro-grams, they have no Jobs for these peo-ple. In Mexico they take raw labor andput them to work. They have movedacross the necessary production machin-ery, the same production 'machinery wehave in the United States, Into theProne,ff Territory of Mexico, where theyare paying $3 a day in the same classifiedJobs In electronics served $3 in the UnitedStates. I want you to look long at thisbill, because the error of the 1970's Isgoing to be the critical error In our life-times. The critical decade in our lifetimeswill be the 1970's when the question willbe decided as to whether we survive asa free-enterprise system or not. UnlessI am miserably mistaken, what we aredoing is to establish the base for thedeterioration of the kind of free laborand free-enterprise system In whichlabor and management have bargainedtogether. We are subsidizing industry thesame as we subsidize agriculture. Wehave never been able to get out fromunder that, and we will never be ableto get out from under this load, becauseIf any person who has just been givena job can get $3,000 as a minlmuzi wageand $2,600 as a Government subsidy, theemployer does not pay the subsidy.I tell you that when you are workingalongside a man, doing exactly the samejob he is doing and. he receives only$3,000, and you receive $5,600 he doesnot want to know or care how manychildren you have. He has been broughtup in an economy where you get paidfor what you do, not for how manychildren you have. What is the u ofCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEtalking about easier abortion laws; whatIs the use of talking about pills? Whatis the use of talking about cutting downthe birth rate when we are introducinga program that would increase the birthrate? I do not know where to go. I donot know where to turn. Do I vote againstpoverty people on do I vote aye and hopefor a chance to correct the inequities Inthe Senate.This I do know: I am a troubled Mem-ber of this Congress this day. We havenot had a chance to offer amendmentsbecause of the closed rule.There is not any sound reason forthis, because we are not going to re-move people from welfare, because inthis country today we still have millionsof persons who are not earning thismoney. We have close to13 millionAmericans we have tried since 1938 tout under the minimum wage law.In the last instance, when the billcame before me, we had reached $1.60an hour, but we had to reach it In a 3-year stretch\u2014and In a 4-year stretchfor some classifications. Why did wemove In the area of minimum wages onclassifications? Because we followed thehistorical lines of a free enterprise so-ciety, and we paid for the job that Isdone. We did not pay for the numberof children people had. If this becomesthe concept, we will find, as sure as weare in this room today in this great'ongress of ours, that the minimum willbecome the maximum.Mr. BYRNESofWisconsin.Mr. Chairman, I yield 10 minutes to the gen-tleman from Ohio (Mr. DEvTwE).(Mr. DEVINE asked and was givenpermission to revise and extend his re-marks.)Mr. DEVINE. Mr. Chairman, I risewith some reluctance today on this leg-islation.Of course, I am not a member of theWays and Means Committee. However.I do feel rather strongly about this billthat apparently Is classified as an ad-ministration bill. I think when the ul-timate vote comes, there will be a cross-section and quite a change in the think-Ing' of a number of our colleagues, andI do not think we will find any particu-lar coalition supporting or opposing thelegislation.When this originally was proposed anumber of months ago, I visited admin-istration offices to try to analyze Justexactly what was coming off. I bow tono one in my support of our President.I think he is a great man doing a greatjob, but I do not consider myself a rub-ber stamp.In analyzing this program as It wasoriginallyIntroduced\u2014andIwouldstressthe word \"origlnally\"\u2014it waspointed out, first, that our current wel-fare programs acoss this Nation are ina shambles, in chaos, they are In a ter-rible situation, and they should be elimi-nated. I would agree 100 percent.It was pointed out further that the so-called Nixon welfare program, that hashad Its name changed two or three times,changed to family a8si8tanCe programand changed to workfare, or changedto anything to get away from the label ofthe guaranteed annual Income, I wouldApril 16,1970say no matter how we slice it, it is stillthat, guaranteed annual Income.The proposal is this, that it would notbe another layer on our ADC, it wouldnot be another layer on the food stampprogram, that it would substitute forthese. It would get rid of the ADC pro-gram and all problems connected with It,and the food stamp program also wouldbe phased out.It contained at that time work incen-tive provisions. I do not think there Isanybody who opposes work Incentiveprovisions.If we talkto the peopleacross the country, if we feel their pu)se,we will find the American people acrossthis country are perfectly willing to helpand assist those unable\u2014and I under-line unable\u2014to help themselves, butthere is a growing reluctance by theAmerican people, the American taxpay-er to be forced to support those unwillingto help themselves.I look at the Members on both sidesof the aisle and find that we talk aboutwork incentives. What work incentivedid Members have to get where they areand do what they were doing before theycame to Congress? Most of us had the in-centive that we like to eat, and most ofus had the Incentive that we wanted tosupport and educate and take care ofour families to the best of our ability.That is sufficient incentive.But the work incentives In this bill,when we get Into \"suitable\" employment,create much concern among those of uswho have misgivings about much thatIs in this bill.After this matter was heard before theCommittee on Ways and Means\u2014andthere were,long hearings, though. mostof them were on social security, I ad-mit\u2014what happened? No longer doesthis substitute for the program. It doesnot substitute for the aid to dependentchildren. It does not substitute for thefood stamp program. It is another layerupon them.The sponsors of the bill say this:\"Well, admittedly this will add from 12million to perhaps 15 million additionalpeople to the welfare rolls, but lookingdown the road 5 or 10 or 15 yearsthis will be cheaper than the currentwelfare reform programs.\"Assuming that this is correct\u2014I doubtit very seriously, but assuming that thisis correct\u2014most of us will not be hereto gain the benefits of this cheaper wel-fare program, because that far on down,ifthiswelfarelistgoes up12to 15 million people higher than It is to-day, there will be between 12 and 15percent of the people of the UnitedStates on welfare.Is that not a great endorsement forthis program?It seems to me we are adopting a phi-losophy which is completely contrary andforeign to the basic American philosophyof the free enterprise system of reward-ing Incentive.Mr. HAYS. Mr. Chairman, will the gen-tleman yield?Mr. DEVINE. I would prefer not toyIeld at this time, but I yield.Mr. HAYS. I want to get the questionIn now about the cost. Does the gentle- April 16, 1970manhave any figures on the cost? I can-not get anybody to tell me that.Mr. DEVINE. I woud say to the gen-tleman from Ohio, so tar as the cost Isconcerned,, the estimated cast I have seenfor the first year, trying to make a studyof this program, is an additional $4.4billion for the first year.Mr. HAYS. I wonder if they are as farwrong on that as they were on medicare,on which they just estimated the costexactly at 30 percent of what the realcost was. If that. should be true, the $4billion would be more like $14 billion,would It not?Mr. DEVINE. It certainly would. Iagree with the gentleman. I have thesame misgivings about the estimated coston this program. It probably would bemuch higher than anticipated.Mr. HAYS. I thank the gentleman.That is the first tIme I have been ableto get anybody to tell me what they arethinking about on the cost.Mr. DEVINE. I would hope that themembers of the Committee on Ways andMeans, who have made a deep study ofthis, would come up with some accuratefigures.Another gentleman from Ohio, Mr.ASHBROOK, worked with the minoritycounsel of the Ways and Means Commit-tee in an effort to come up with a legiti-mate and good faith cost on this. Hegave an example of a family of four witha certain income, a certain amount ofmoney each week. They worked at greatlength and were unable to come up witha figure that they could agree upon.In talking about work incentives, Iwould invite attention to an article whichappeared March 21, 1970, in the Scripps-Howard newspaper, talking about thework-incentive program. This particularrelease, under the name of Robert J.Havel, out of the Plain Dealer Bureau,Cleveland, with a Washington dateline,says:The U.S. Department of Labor considersOhio's. work-Incentive program for welfarerecipients a flop and is unlikely to provideany money for the program in fiscal 1971.This Is the same program, conducted in20 Ohio counties, which Goy. James A.Rhodes recently praised as helping to getpeople off the welfare rolls and onto pay-rolls.The national program, referred to as WIN,isdesignedprimarilytotrainwelfare mothers for such jobs as nurse's aides andclerks.It goes on further:This Is basically asPresident Nixon's \"work fare\" h1 newwelfare plan, on which will actscon.That Is what we are talking abouttoday.Mr. BETIS Mr. Chairman, will thegentleman yield?Mr. DEVINE. I am happy to yield tothe gentleman from Ohio.Mr. BErrS. I should like to make onecomment to the gentleman. He is one ofmy close friends, I do not like to contra-dict him, but I just want to make surethe statement he read Is compared withthe statement I read yesterday quotingGovernor Rhodes, in which he praisedthe program In Ohio. He stated howmany had been taken off the rolls, andCONCRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 ROUSEthat the WIN program had reduced theexpense of wellare in Ohio over $200,000a month.I just wonder whether that Is not asimportant a consideration as the state-mont of some Federal omclal as to howhe looks at it.Mr. DEVINE. What [ important is Iam merely quoting an article which ap-peared in the Cleveland Plain Dealer.One of the things which concerns raefurther is the auction game we are get-ting Into with this legislation. I do notknow whether they call it a, ceiling or afloor, but they are talking about a floorof $1,600. In the next election year Itwill be $2,000 or $2,500. Already some aretalking about $5,000. Each year they willbid higher and higher. Where will It end,and will It get everybody on here?The senior Senator from New Yorkspoke In the other body yesterday. Iwould invite the attention of our col-leagues to the RECORD for April 15, pub-lished today, page 85753, in which hesays:I shall propose an amendment exemptingmothers of school-age children and otherrelatives who care for such children fromthe work and training requirements of thebill.Then In another part he says:As I request cosponsorship for thiS amend-ment in the coming days, I hope that manyof the Members of the Senate will join withme, whether or not they support the familyassitance plan, to indicate their strongopposition to the inclusion of any suchwork requirement in the crucial welfare-reform legislation which will be acted uponby the Congress this year.So if and when this matter leaves hereand goes to the other body, I do not be-lieve you will recognize it. The floor willbecome the ceiling arid the ceiling willbecome the floor, and the $1,600 figurewill be In the area of $5,000 or $6,000.We will be in a category where I am re-minded of the old farmer when he wastalking about helping people. Re said,\"You know, If everybody climbs in thewagon, who is going to pull it?\" If we getover 10 or 12 percent of the populationon welfare, do you think the rest of uswill be able to pick up the load? It is adangerous step and I think the Houseought to defeat thIs legislation, I amopposed to it, and will vote against It,and I am convinced the Nation willregretthe day this philosophy wasadopted, if the Rouse does indeed, passthis unworkable legislation.The CHAIRMAN. The time of the gen-tleman from Ohio has expired.Mr. FULTON of Tennessee. Mr. Chair-man, I yield 5 mInutes to a member ofthe committee, the gentleman from Cali-fornia (Mr. CORMAN).(Mr. CORMAN asked and was givenpermission to revise and extend his re-marks.)Mr. CORMAN. Mr. Chairman, I rise insupport of HR. 16311, the Family Assist-ance Act.Our chairman, the gentleman fromArkanSas (Mr. MILLS), has explained Ingrt detail the reforms which this billwill bring about, I would like to underline-three which are of particular importance.FIrst, It is the work incentive provisionThis bill will require ieeIp4ents who have113151the ability to work to register for trainingand emp1c'ment as a condition to rec\u00e7iv-ing benefits I would not overstate theimportance of this provision because Iam convinced that almost every Ameri-can wants to work, and the mandatorynature of this provision is not going tosignificantly change that situation.Another incentive has to do with thatportion of one's earned inoome which arecipient will be permitted to keep. Underthe present program, a nlother who goesto work may be in danger of losing herassistance payment. While at work, shehas the additional disadvantage of notknowing how her children are faringwithout her. The reform bill will assurethat her children are being eared forwhile she is at work, and will permit herto keep a reasonable share of her earn-ings, In addition to her assistance pay-merit.The second and certainly the mostImportant part of this bill, as far as the8tate of California Is concerned, Is thata substantial increase in the share ofwelfare costs will be borne by the Fed-eral Government. For California, thiswill amount to about $200 million Inthe first full year of the implementationof the act, assuming that the State willtake advantage of the Federal Govern-ment's offer to administer the program.It would then be possible for the Stategovernment to assume the balance ofCalifornia's welfare costs, thereby com-pletely relieving the counties In the Stateof this financial burden.Such a step would permit welfare coststo be shifted to the broader State andFederal tax base, leaving the local taxbase free to bear the cost of educationaland other municipal reqdirenjents,The third Important reform Is the es-tablishinent of a Federal minimum pay-ment. Let us 'take a look at this FederalmInimum. Is it really dangerously high?For a family of four without Income, theminimum is $2,400 a year; $1,600 in cashand $800 In food stamps. Now, it justhappens that I support a family of fourand It also happens that my take-homepky is approximately $2,400 a month. Iassume each of us is generally in thatsame category. If you would like to knowthe adequacy of this minimum payment,take next month's paycheck home tOyour wife and tell her she must supportyour family on it for a year. I believeshe will convince you that itis not excessive,I have been surprised to hear some ofmy colleagues worry about the willing-ness of Americans to. work if we removethe Incentive of hunger. I cannot acceptthe proposition that a man works onlyIf and when he is hungry. The fact ofthe matter is that the state of hungerundoubtedly diminishesone's mentaland physical capacity to work. I believethat Americans are Inspired to seekwork for many more reasons than justthe need of food. I think that we havecome a long way from that rather primi-tIve notion of why people work.Finally, a number of Members havebeen critical of the Ways and MeansCommittee because we cannot tell theexact amount of the cost of this pro- gram. I would have to say to you thatIf you can tell me how many people H3152inthe Nation will be unemployed in thenext year, and the next, and the next,then I can give you a reasonably accu-rate figure as to the cost of this program.For instance, if we have full employ-ment\u2014if everyone who has the abilityhas the opportunity for a job\u2014then thecost of the program will be relativelylow. And, we will then be taking careonly of the aged, the blind, the physicallydisabled, and orphaned children whoseparents are dead or in prison or forsome other reason are not capable oftaking care of them. But, if the presenttrend continues and unemployment in-creases and we find millions of Amer-icans willing and eager to work butunable to find jobs, then the cost of thisprogram will be substantial.We do not report to you that thisbill will solve the Nation's economic ills.We do say that it will, in a modest way,provide some decent living standard forthose who because of economic circum-stances find themselves in dire straits.Let us look at the alternatives. Whathappened after 1929? Americans, unableto work, stood In soup lines. Childrenbegged or stole for food. Families weremade homeless because they were unableto continue payments on their homes orwere unable to pay rent. This country Isnot going back to those conditions andpractices.There are lots of things that need tobe done In this country. We need moreand better schools; more and bettermedical care. We need to end pollutionof our streams and air. Programs such asthese\u2014and many more like them.\u2014cre-ate jobs, and jobs cut down the cost ofwelfare.But, we are not authorizing such pro-grams In this bill. All we are saying inthis bill is that If there are jobs, thenneedy people who qualify under the bill'sprovisions, must be trained for jobs andrequired to take them. If they have thephysical and mental ability to do that,then out of the generosity. of the Amen-can people, they will be given enough tokeep body and soul together. If jobs arenot available, neither will they have tostarve or steal.I urge my colleagues to support HR.16311.Mr. KAZEN. Mr. Chairman, will thegentleman yield?Mr. CORMAN. I yield to the gentle-man.Mr. KAZEN. I agree with some of thethings which the gentleman from Cali-fornia has said.Mr. CORMAN. I hope the gentleman,then, will support the bill.Mr. KAZEN. However, the point Is,with reference to this bill, that it is notgoing to create jobs. I come from an areawhere there is a great degree of unem-ployment. The gentleman talks about a4- or 5-percent unemployment rate. Ihave an li-percent unemployment ratein some parts of my district. The reasonfor that is the fact that there are no jobsavailable. We have trained people for allkinds of work under the various pro-grams that now exist but when all of thetraining was over, they did not have ajob at which to work.What in the world are we going to dowith that problem?CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEMr. CORMAN. There is provision inthis bill for public works projects wherewe can federally fund certain projects inareas such as one which the gentlemanhas described, on the condition that theprogram in that area will enable someof these people to become ultimately em-ployed in the private sector. It is In asense a small WPA. True, it is only ashort-term answer, but again we can-not take care of all the economic ills ofthe Nation in any welfare assistance bill.This must be taken care of under theprivate enterprise system and other fiscaldecisions which we must make.Mr. KAZEN. Mr. Chairman, if the gen-tlemah will yield further, the thing thatworries at least this gentleman is thefact that here we are dIscussing guaran-teeing a minimum annual Income whileI think what we ought to direct ourselvesto is a more pressing need\u2014that of guar-anteeing a job for those able to workbeforeweguaranteeanyIncomeminimums.Mr. CORMAN. I will say to the gentle-man that there is a legitimate case whichcan be made for the Federal Governmentbecoming an employer of last resort.However, I have some misgivings aboutthat, but if unemployment continues torise, we may find it necessary.Mr. BElTS. Mr. Chairman, I yield10 minutes to the gentleman from 1111-nois (Mr. COLLIER).(Mr. COLLIER asked and was givenpermission to revise and extend hisremarks.)Mr. COLLIER. Mr. Chairman, over thepast two decades, I can think of nosingle domestic program In this countrywhich has been more consistently or bit-terly criticized than the welfare system.The criticism of our welfare systemhas come from a spectrum ranging fromthe man on the street to the legislativeand executive leaders In the country.The present system has been calleddeplorable, unfair, parasitic, and intol-erable.I have never refuted these criticismsbecause they properly describe the pres-ent welfare system, which is unfair andis deplorable and is intolerable. In fact,the present system breeds irresponsibil-ity that feeds on Itself.I have also heard many of the ardentcritics of the present welfare system say,\"We ought to help people who are will-ing to help themselves.\" and I have heardthem say, \"We ought to help people helpthemselves.\" And I wholeheartedly agree.But in listening to these same criticsattack the legislation before us today, Ifind them strangely Inconsistent.I had hoped that there would be strongsupport to get rid of the present welfaresystem and replace it with one that con-forms to the lipservice reform over theyears.Yet I do not find a single item of leg-islation introduced by those who haveattacked the present program and aremaking a career out of criticizing theone which is proposed In this legislation.If the present welfare system Is sodeplorable and if the proposed legisla-tion is unacceptable, it Is only logical toask why those who find themselves inthis position have not done somethingabout offering a constructive alternative.April 16, 1970Yet throughout the hearings on thisbill, no one came forward with anythingthat resembled a replacement in thebroad sense for the present obsoleteprogram.The attacks I have heard on the pro-posed leglsation have not been directedto the concept or the principle of thislegislation, but rather to fear based onconjecture that it will not be admln1-tered In accoradnce with our legislativeintent. Well, now, let me tell you thatno program, no matter how carefully de-vised, will be any more effective thanthe manner In which It Is administered.ThIsiscertainlyobvious under anyconditions.And I have heard such argumentsagainst this bill in the last 2 days aswould provide the attitudes of the courtsas a. reason to oppose this legislation.And, of course, I have been around herelong enough to know that when argu-ments based on conjecture rather thanfact fall to satisfy the need for any typeof reform, you can always fall back onthe \"foot in the door\" or the \"camel'snose under the tent\" approach\u2014andthis has not been overlooked by the op-ponents\u2014yet I think we must under-stand that these cliches of forebodingreally fail to address themselves to thereal issue.It Is all right to agree that we have aproblem\u2014but when we do it seems tome that we ought to agree that thereshould be some solution.I see no rfed at this point In the debateto belabor the excellent presentationsof Chairman MILLS and the rankingminority member ofthecommIttee,JOHN BYRNES. But I would like to sum-marize my own position as concisely asmy remaining time permits.We can no longer accept and condonea welfare system that has failed mIser-ably, a welfare system that has fostereddisintegration of the family unit; We canno longer accept and condone a systemwhich frequently makes it more attrac-tive to go on the welfare rolls than towork. We can no longer tolerate a wel-fare system that is a failure and onewhich grows worse each day.I am convinced that if there Is any so-lution to the growing welfare problem Inthis country, and If there Is any hope forhelping the people in the lowest economicstrata of our society, It lies In the ap-proach embraced in this legislation. Tosuggest It does not is to suggest there Isno hope. To suggest that those who areeconomically depressed fall into a singu-lar category of people who are not and donot want to help themselves Is to againsay we must continue the present systemIn the hopeless fashion of Increasing wel-f are costs year after year.Well, I am neither naive nor am I a do-gooder. While I offer no one an insurancepolicy on the success of this program, Isincerely believe that on a long-termbasis It will cost the people of this coun-try a great deal less in both dollars andhuman resources.And permit me to remind every Memn-ben of this House, including those whoare opposed to this bill, that we are pro-viding a structure upon which Improve-nients can be made through the processof revision and amendment. llf it Is nec- April 16,1970CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSE H3153essary to provide more stringent enforce-ment of the work provisions, it is theresponsibility of Congress to do so. And Ihappen to think the Congress will do soIf we are able to integrate the work andtraining provisions with the welfare pay-ments and correct the gross inequities Inthe existing program.I urge every Member of this House togive welfare reform a chance. To doanything less is to accept the presentprogram, with all of its present short-comings, and its inevitable social doom.Mr. FtJLTON of Tennessee. Mr. Chair-man, I yield 5 mInutes to the gentlemanfrom New York (Mr. SCHEiTER).Mr. S.CHET.JER. Mr. Chairman, I wouldlike to praise the chairman of the Com-mittee on Ways and Means for his ad-mirable leadership in preparing the for-ward-looking bill indeed, the precedentshattering bill we are considering to-day\u2014and for the excellent committee re-port on that bill.In the report the committee regrettedthat many manpower programs in thepast \"often emphasized work at the ex-pense of meaningful training that wouldlead to the family leaving the publicassistance rolls.\"Of course, that is a major goal of thisbill\u2014to enable people to acquire the edu-cation and job training to become em-ployed, financially independent, and self-supporting.Section 431 (c) (2) of H.R,. 16311, evI-dently a suggestion how to rectify thosemistake., mentions the following servicesfor the trainees in manpower trainingand employment programs: \"counseling,testing, coaching, program orientation,institutional and on-the-job training,work experience, upgrading, job develop-ment, job placement and follow up serv-ices required to assist in securing and re-taining employment and opportunitiesfor advancement.\"Mr. Chairman, am I right in under-standing these sections as endorsementsof efforts to contribute to the broaderadoption of new methods of structuringjobs and of providing career-ladder op-portunities?Mr. MILLS. Upgrading the skills ofthe working poor is an important partof the proposal, and It Is a very Importantpart.Mr. SCHEUER. I thank the distin-guished chairman.Mr. Chairman, section 433 of H.R.16311 states that the Secretary of Laborshould try to \"further the establishmentofan integrated and comprehensivemanpower training program Involvingallsectorsofthe economy andall levels of government\" and to \"make max-Imum use of existing manpower relatedprograms and agencies.\"Mr. Chairman, will the jobs encom-passed under these programs includethose designed to improve the social andeconomic conditions of the communityby upgrading the quality of the publicservices In health, education, welfare, andpublic safety?Mr. MILLS. Yes; I might say to tnegentleman, if they are a part of an es-tablished training program.Mr. SCHEUER. Mr. Chairman, thecommittee report states:By requiring that the prime grantees dem-onstrate a capacity to work effectively withthe manpower agency, the Committee be-ileves that a greater degree of coordinationof manpower and child care services can beachieved than has been the case In previousprograms.Would this improved coordination ofmanpower and child care services in-clude the use of the children's parents asaides and for some of them\u2014in time andafter the proper training\u2014as profes-sionals at Yes; it intended.Mr. SCHEUER. Thedistinguishedchairman of the Ways and Means Com-mittee, in my view, Is to be congratulatedfor encouraging relief recipients to be-come economicallyindependent.Re- cently the Washington Post had an arti-cle on the city welfare department's deci-sion to cut off the welfare of an unwedwelfare mother in her last semester ofhigh school.I assume that the distinguished chair-man would favor helping a relief recipi-ent to complete high school since, dem-onstrably,sucheducation and highschool degree Is so necessary to help herget a good job and thus achieve financialindependence for herself and her chil-dren. Would that be a fair statement ofthe intent of the House?Mt. MILLS. The answer would dependupon the individual case. As I said ear-lier, this bill Is not Intended to supportstudents primarily, but If a person Isclose to completing her education, it could be determined by the EmploymentSecurity Office that completing educa-tion Is approprlat training.Mr. SCHEUER. I very much appreci-ate the chairman's answer. I appreciatehis candor In answering all of thesequestions. I wish to express my admira-tion for the great job the committee hasdone during untold months of hearingsand in producing a bill and a committeereport that In many respects Is one ofthe most far-reaching, Imaginative, andcreative pieces of legislation we have con-sidered in many years.(Mr. SCHEUER asked andwas givenpermission to revise and extend his re-marks.)Mr. BETTS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. WILLIAMS).(Mr. WILLIAMS asked and was givenpermission to revise and extend his re-marks.)Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Chairman, theproposed Family Assistance Act of 1970\u2014H.R. 16311\u2014would prove a dreadfulhoax on the American people.This so-called assistance pro-gram\" would Immediately add a mini-mum of $4.4 billion to Federal welfarecosts, and would place additional mil-lions of people on welfare rolls. The onlywelfare program that FAP would phaseout would be aid to families with de-pendent children, on which the FederalGovernment now spends $2.1 bifilon per year.Past experience has proved that when-ever a new welfare program Is createdfor the purpose of solving a problem,that problem is only accentuated and Itscost escalated. Be assured that FAP willbe no exception.The Federal share of FAP for eachfamily would be based on an annual $500,each, for tile first two members offamily, plus $300 for each additional f am-ily member with the States required tosupplement the massive Federal pay-ment.Obviously, It would only be a matterof time until FAP-guaranteed paymentswould be increased In response to well-established pressures b self-seeking offi-cials, liberal social theorists, and -hardcore professional welfarists.A major FAP weakness would be In thefact that eight types of income would beexcluded ,from consideration before FAPpayments would be determined. Sinceeach family's payments would have to bedetermined individually in accordancewith Income earned, a virtual army ofInvestigators and accountants would beneeded for this operation alone.FAP would require recipients to reg-ister for suitable training or employ-ment. But FAP would conveniently ex-clude five classes of people from thatsame registration. Further, It would pro-vide no spelling out the definition of pre-cisely what \"suitable\" training or em-ployment would really be. Nor wouldFAP spell out any procedure that mightbe applied to those who accept jobs butpurposefully fail to perform properly inorder to be fired and return to welfare.FAP would provide for recovery of anyfunds fraudulently collected from theFederal Government, with enforcementresting with the Department of Justice.However, with the tens of thousands offathers who have deserted their families,and with thousands of unenforced courtorders already out on fathers In behalfof dependent children, It would requirea doubling of the size of the Justice De-partment just to enforce FAP's recoveryof fraudulent collection provision.FAP would provide that a new agencybe established within the Department ofHealth, Education, and Welfare to ad-minister FAP's provisions.This new agency would have to employ thousandsof people and, In short order, could, infact, easily result in doubling the pres-ent size of HEW, itself.An abundant history makes It perfect-ly obvious that this so-called familyassistance program would prove to benothing more than just another giganticgiveaway which would further rewardthe Indolent and the malcontent. Thiswould be accomplished at the expense Ofthose who work and support their fam-iliesdespitethe evermore oppressiveodds of high taxes borne, In great part, oftoo many \"somethingfornothing\" schemes.1 have also heard In this Chamber thisafternoon that the State of Massachu-setts is using approximately 25 percentof Its budget for welfare purposes and that States and other localities needhelp. Let me tell the Members some- thing. We can go from one section ofthIs country to another, and we wouldhave to look hard to find any State inas poor financial condition as our Fed-eral Government.Next year alone we are going to have H 3154to refinance over $100 billion in Federalobligations that are going to mature,and we are not prepared to pay off onepenny of that $100 billion in Federalobligations that are going to matureduring fiscal year 1971, which startsJuly 1,1970. We are going to be for-tunate to be able to refinance this $100billion in maturing obligations at in-terest rates as low as 8 percent.We have reached a point where every3 years and 8 months we have to re-finance our entire national debt, and ifwe have to refinance our entire nationaldebt of over $360 billion at 8 percent,that is going to be a $30 billion a yearannual payment on interest alone.This will mean on welfare and intereston the national debt we are going to bespending far more than 25 percent ofour budget, so as it turns out the Statesare in much, much better condition thanour Federal Government.Relief of human misery, easement ofthe pains of recovery, and assurance ofequitable opportunity fall in one cate-gory\u2014but to elevate and lock in profes-sional welfarism as a part of the so-called American way of life falls intoquite another category which the peopleof this Nation simply could not affordand would not long knowingly tolerate.Mr. BETTS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 10minutes to the gentleman from Michi-gan (Mr. CHAMBERLAIN).(Mr. CHAMBERLAIN asked and wasgiven permission to revise and extendhis remarks.)Mr. CHAMBERLAIN. Mr. Chairman.I rise in support of H.R. 16311, a billproviding comprehensive changes in ourFederal, State, and local welfare pro-gram. Everyone who has studied thepresent program agrees on one salientfact: that it is deficient in almost everyrespect.Our present program has grown dra-matically in recent years, both in termsof the individuals covered and total dol-lar costs. Between 1961 and 1970, thenumber of families and individual re-cipients more than doubled\u2014to a totalof 1.8 million families and 7 million in-dividuals. During this same period totalcosts have nearly doubled to the presenttotal of $4.2 billion.This runaway pattern is expected tocontinue into the future unless funda-mental reforms are made, with the num-ber of recipients nearly doubling againby 1975 and the total costs more thandoubling. The immense burden that thisprogram imposes on taxpayers at alllevels of government demands that weaddress ourselves to this chaotic situa-tion rather than turning our heads tolook the other way and hope the prob-lem will go away.The present program discourages workand self -su.fficiency by providing a \"guar-anteed annual income\" to individualswho qualify for welfare virtually with-out regard to their own efforts. In manycases individuals are financially betteroff on welfare than they are working.By d.iscriminatirig against the workingpoor, the present program not only en-courages idleness but provides a strongincentive for family disintegration. Onlyby leaving home can a working poorCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEfather qualify his family for benefitsunder the aid to families with dependentchildren program.The bill before the House today willgo a long way toward correcting thesedefects. Instead of an incentive for idle-ness, the bill will insure that individualswill always be better off if they are work-ing. Rather than providing a 'guaran-teed annual income\" regardless of anindividual'sefforts,assistance will becontingent on an individual makingeveryeffortto become self .sufficientthrough work, training, and employ-ment. The incentive for family breakupunder present law will be substantiallydiminished and in many cases elimi-nated by proving coverage for the work-ing poor.The emphasis in this new program Isto help people care for themselves bydeveloping their potential. This will, ofcourse, cost additional money in the firstfew years, but it must be rememberedthat this islong-range program andgiven time it is our hope that it will, beless expensive\u2014both in human and indollar costs.I would like to take this occasion topoint out that the bill does create onevery serious inequity for working peo-ple who will not receive benefits underthis bill that, in my opinion, we cannotignore. One of the reforms in this billprovides day care for small children inorder to enable adults who would nor-mally care for them to receive trainingand employment so that they may be-come self-sufficient. The Department ofHealth, Education, and Welfare intendsto request $386 million for child carepurposes for the first full year of oper-ation. It is estimated that this will pro-vide care for 300,000 school age childrenat an estimated cost of $400 per child,and for 150,000 preschool children at anestimated cost of $1,600 per child. Theseday care provisions of the bill are essen-tial to enable individuals to move fromthe welfare rolls to the employment rolls,and I support them.However, as we face up to the actualcosts of child care we find that theamounts involved are much more gener-otis than the deductions we now allowunder the Internal Revenue Code fornonwelf are taxpayers who have to payfor child care themselves in order to beavailable to work. The Internal RevenueCode provides a child care deduction of$600 where one child is involved, and$900 where two children are involved.In addition, under the law this allow-ance is reduced by $1 for every dolar thatthe parents' income exceeds $6,000. Thismeans that the child care deduction iseliminated when income reaches $6,600In the case of one child and $6,900 in thecase of two children.Thus, in New Jersey, under the newbill,a welfare mother with two pre-school children and one school age child,would be entitled to child care benefitsapproximating $3,600, as long as her in-come from earnings and public assist-ance does not exceed $6,547\u2014the Sec-retary has discretion to continue payingchild care expenses at even higher in-come levels for a period of time. Yet aworking couple with three children ofApril 16,1970similar age earning $6,457 would be en-titled to a child care deduction of only$343. Assuming the couple Is in the 15percent income tax bracket, this deduc-tion would provide a net benefit of only$51.45. And if the couple should increasetheir income to $6,900, they would not beentitled to any deduction.Mr. Chairman, we cannot ask theworking cou'iple to pay taxes to supportnot only public assistance recipients, btitto provide them with child care allow-ances far in excess of the meager incometax deduction taxpayers are allowed.This is wrong. Current allowable deduc-tionsforchildcareareunrealistic.Equity requires that the child care de-duction in our income tax law be liberal-ized to provide benefits commensuratewith the current cost of child care.In order to accomplish this, I havejoined in Introducing legislation thatwould increase the deduction for childcare expenses to $1,200 in the case of onechild, and to $2,400 where two or morechildren are involved. The legislationwould also repeal the provisions of pres-ent law that phase out the deductionwhen the taxpayer's Income exceeds$6,000. This would recognize that childcare expenses that are incurred to enablea taxpayer to work, are expenses suffi-ciently related to the taxpayer's job tojustify deduction as a business expense.In my judgment this Is a matter ofhigh priority. In the bill we are consider-ing today we are trying to provide incen-tives and opportunities for people to getoff the welfare roles, In doing so weshould not ignore the effort of those whohave managed by one means or anotherto take care of themselves. We shouldnot create or condone a dual cost ap-proach to child care by recognizing theactual cost of this service for welfare re-cipients and something less than theactual cost for those who have had theinitiative to get a job to help take careof' themselves. How in good conscience,I ask, can we deny these working parentsa realistic deduction and then use theirtax money, In part, to give a benefit un-available to them to others?The Committee on Ways and Means Isaware of this gross inequity, and I feelthe members are disposed to see that ItIs corrected. It Is my hope that our chair-man will make certain that this matterreceives early consideration to the endthat remedial legislation may be en-acted.Mr. Chairman, I am sure that the mat-ter which I have just discussed Is notthe only problem area that will be dis-covered as this reform measure Is imple-mented. I well realize that the family as-sistance plan Is not without Its critics forI, too, have reservations. However, as wehave worked on this bill\u2014week afterweek\u2014month after month\u2014I have beenimpressed with the fact that no one seemsto have a better plan to suggest. Norhave I heard anyone offer any strongdefense of the present system. While I amwell aware that we cannot solve,our com-plex welfare problems by any legislativemagic, I am satisfied that society's great-est hope lies in a new philosophical ap-proach to our aggravated welfare prob-lems ... onewhich encourages work and April 16, 1970neitherstifles nor destroys individual-initiative. It is for this reason, and withthis hope, that I support H.R. 16311.Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Chairman, willthe gentleman yield?Mr. CHAMBERLAIN. I am glad toyieldto the gentleman from Penn-sylvania.Mr. W]LLIAMS. I would like to callto the attention of the distingiishedgentleman from Michigan that in morethan half of the States the father doesnot have to leave the household in orderfor the family to receive aid under theprogram of aid to dependent children.However, I do want to agree with thepoint which has been made by the gen-tleman that the AFDC program Is atotally insufficient program. It is mad-equate and doing nothing but accentuatethe problem.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN. I believe every-one agrees with the gentleman's state-ment.Mr. WILLIAMS. I would like to say tothe gentleman from Michigan and tothe gentleman from Illinois (Mr. COL-LIER) and anyone else who is interestedthat I have worked on a substitute planwhich I think I have fairly well refinednow which would phase out AFDC overa period of time and which would pro-duce much, much better results, whilethis phasing out is being accomplished.I would welcome the opportunity totalk to the gentleman in his office atany time about this alternate plan.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN. I would say tomy colleague that I am pleased to hearthis. I feel it is unfortunate that we havenot had the benefit of his suggestions atan earlier date In order that they couldhave been considered by the committeeas this matter has been under review.I think anyone who has any constructivesuggestion to help us out of the mess weare in right now should come forward.We would be glad to hear from anyonewho has a better plan.Mr. WILLIAMS. Ieserve your decisionbecause you may not agree with my plan.Mr. BETTS. Mr. Chairman, I yieldsuch time as he may consume to thegentleman from Michigan (Mr. HUTCHIN-SON).(Mr. HUTCHINSON asked and wasgiven permission to revise and extendhis remarks.)Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. Chairman, weare all agreed that the present ADC pro-gram is a mess and that It is now, or soonwill be, completely out of hand. It mustbe replaced. The administration has pro-posed the bill now before us a a newapproach\u2014workfare instead of welfare,it is called. Many of us have great res-ervations about this particular approach,but some have been able to resolve thosedoubts in favor of the legislation, whileothers, and I am one of those, have foundthe doubts so great that in good con-science we cannot support it. I propose tostate briefly, Mr. Chairman, those ques-tions about the bill which have persuadedme that, much as a new approach to wel-fare is needed, this Is not the anwer. In-deed, Mr. Cheirman I doubt that thesituation will be one whit Improved butrather worsened by the enactment of thislegislation.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014HOUSEThe ADC program will be abolished bythis bill, and that is all to the good, anda family assistance program instituted inits place. But the new program, of familyassistance does not change much the ADCprogram as it applies to fatherless homes.So long as there is a child under 6\u2014andthere most usually is a child under 6 inthose homes\u2014the mother need not regis-ter for employment or take work trainingin order to obtain the Federal benefit,and the State In which the family isliving is required to supplement the Fed-eral program up to the level of paymentsthat family now receives from ADC. Asto that family, therefore, the ADC pro-gram continues,, in everything but name.And, Mr. Chairman, the vast majority ofpresent ADC ,cases fall within the cate-gory of a family without a man in thehouse. To all intents and purposes, theproposal in this bill carries forward thepresent ADC program without change.Under the present program an ADCmother is encouraged to take work train-ing and better her lot in life thereby\u2014on a voluntary basis. This bill carries thesame approach.As to those cases where there is a manin the house, the bill requires him toregister with the employment service,receive their counsel, take their trainingprogram, and accept a job they find forhim. But the proferred employment mustbe suitable work. Now that term, \"suitablework,\" has acquired a meaning in the law.it is a term well understood in unem-ploymentcompensationsystems.It means that an unemployed individualneed not take a job beneath his skills, butonly such employment as he has regu-larly had in the past. it is argued that inthe case of the newly trained individualwithout work experience this unemploy-ment compensation meaning of suitablework will not apply. I anticipate that itwill mean that if a man is trained for aparticular skill, no other type of employ-ment will be deemed suitable for him,even though there may be no need forsuch employment in his community. Iexpect that the term \"suitable work\" willhave the same narrowing meaning in therequirement for employment within thefamily assistance program as it has hadIn unemployment compensation.But if a newly trained individual is putto work within the scope of his newtraining, there Is no compulsion upon himto do his best to keep the job. Suppose.he quits, or isfired for cause. Whatthen? Will his eligibility under the fam-ily assistance program continue?And even if he refuses to work, theonly economic penalty upon him is a lossof $300 in family assistance benefit to hisfamily unit. Benefits to the other mem-bers of his family continue, and if heleaves home, his wife and children cancomply with the ADC requirements, withtheir family benefits supplemented byState grants up to the level now pro-vided.I doubt this family assistance plan hasenough economic lnducement within it toachieve that goal of keeping families to-gether.Mr. Chairman, the legislation we nowconsider is Intended to meet the prob-lem, made Infinitely worse by recentH3155Supreme Court decisions outlining res-idency requirements for welfare assist..ance, which results from a variation ofbenefits among the States. Some, likeMichigan, have become a magnet tothose people because of the generosityof their welfare payments. Some waymust be found to level off the benefitstructures between the States and todiscourage the inmigration of welfarecases into some States where the bene-fits are generous\u2014but so is the cost ofliving in those States high. The require-ment in this bill that those States mustsupplement the Federal payments onADC cases to their present levels meansthe inmigration of such cases will likelycontinue.A fundamental change in this new ap-proach is to embrace the working poorinto the welfare system. I had hopedthe solutIon to our welfare problemswould be programs to reduce the de-pendence of people on welfare. This billincreases that dependence. True, it pur-ports to contain inducements sumcientto persuade large numbers of people tolift themselves out of that dependence.The ambitious will be so encouraged.But for many if not most, I suspect theywill not feel sure enough of themselvesto want to completely separate them-selves from the security of tax free wel-fare income, and the welfare system aswe now it\u2014but greatly expanded in costsand in numbers\u2014will continue.Much as I concur, Mr. Chairman, inthe need for a complete change in ourwelfare system, I do not believe thislegislation will accomplish it. This billis not the answer we seek. I wish I knewthe answer. I believe we must look fur-ther for it.Mr. BETTS. Mr. Chairman, I yield10 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio(Mr. ASHBROOK).(Mr. ASHBROOK asked and wasgiven permission to revise and extendhis remarks.)Mr. PRICE of Texas. Mr. Chairman,will the gentleman yield?Mr. ASHBROOK. I yield to the gen-tleman from Texas.(Mr. PRICE of Texas asked and wasgiven permission to revise and extendhis remarks.)Mr. PRICE of Texas. Mr. Chairman,I rise to announce that I cannot in goodconscience support the proposed FamilyAssistance Act of 1970.My opposition is based on three fac-tom: The sentiment of the voters In the18th DIstrict of Texas, my belief thatwelfare reform has been turned into a po-litical football, and my deep-seated res-ervations about the act itself. I wouldlike to discuss each of these factors inturn.The opposition of the vqters in the18th Congressional District of Texas, tothe proposed Family Assistance Act Isoverwhelming. The message has come tome through attitudinal surveys, congres-sional correspondence, and numerousdiscussions I have had on the Issue withconstituents. The message is loud andclear\u2014vote \"no\" on the proposed wel-fare reforms. I agree with this message;In addition, as the Representative of the18th District, I feel bound by the elected H 3156expression of the voters' views on thisissue.I also believe that the welfare reformproposed by the President have beenturned into apoliticalfootball, ndthat the issue will be used in an attemptto discredit the President's good faitheffort to reform the national welfare sys-tem. By way of explanation, in the nor-mal case, the President proposes legisla-tion to Congress. The legislation is thenintroduced and referred to an appro-priate committee where substantial re-writing and redrafting is affected. Thereason for this is clear. It is not pos-sible for the Presldexit to anticipate Inadvance what each particular commit-tee member must have in a bill beforehe can suppOrt it. Consequently, the Pres-ident is forced to propose legislation toCongress which presents his programsin such a manner that an appropriatecommittee can have the opportunity tomodify it to suit its preference; hope-fully,withoutkillingthe President'sbasic proposals in the process.This was not the case, however, withthe proposed welfare reforms. The ma-jority on the House Ways and MeansCommittee approved the bill almost as itwas written by the President. They thenwent before the Rules committee In aneffort to Insure that the bill would bedebated under a rule not allowing for thesubmission of corrective amendmentsfrom the House floor.This Is mOst unusual. A President'sproposals usually do not receive suchuniform approval from a House commit-tee. This is especially true when thePresident belongs to a different politicalparty than does the majority of commit-tee members. The majority Members arenormally too jealous of their legislativeprerogatives and too partisan to bendwithout challenge to the Presidentialwill.The President's comprehensive tax re-form program Is an excellent example ofthe tendency to Which I am referring.The President submitted his proposals toCongress last year, and by the time theHouse Ways and Means Committee gotthrough rewriting the proposals, theiroriginal form was hardly recognizable.I can think of one good reason why thePresident'swelfarereformproposals were so uniformiy approved by the Waysand Means Committee. The legitimatecause of welfare reform has beeome fa-tally involved with partisan politics, andliberal members of the majority partywant to fabricate a campaign Issue forthe November elections. They have tomake up campaign issues because thePresident by his actions has not handedthem any. He Is trying in the best fashionhe knows how, to lead the country into aproductive and peaceful decade. Theother party knows this; but more Impor-tan'tly, the American people know it also.That Is Why the issue Is being fabricated.It Is a lame attempt to discredit thePresident. I will have no part of it.In making his proposals to Congress,President Nixon made a good faith effortto interest Congress in addressing itselfto the cancerous problem of welfare; un-fortunately, House liberals seem more in-terested In partisan politics than mean-lngful reform.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEFinally, I have some strong reserva-tions about the merits of the Family As-sistance Act as it is presently written. Ithink the present welfare system is can-cerous because it benefits neither thewelfare recipient, the taxpayer who sup-ports the program, nor society in genera]which must continue to strive for prog-ress despite the continued drag causedby the sizeable number of individualswho would rather take a Federal reliefcheck than a jobi'Our present welfare system has madeit more profitable for ,some people to loafthan to work. In addition to the individ-ual and family problems this directlycreates, think for a minute what it doesto the incentives of an individual whoworks a full work week and earns forhis labors only a few dollars more thandoes the wastrel on relief.This is just a bare bones descriptionof the negative effects of the present sys-tem, effects we have heard more fullydescribed in other speeches here in theHouse Chamber yesterday and today. Forthis reason, I will not dwell on the nega-tive parts of the welfare system at anygreater lengths, but will turn to a briefexplanation of why I do not think theproposed Family Assistance Act solvesthe Nation's welfare problem.The act proposes that the FederalGovernment finance minimum annualwelfare payments of $500 for each of thefirst two members of a family and $300for each additional member. This meansthat a family of four, the statisticalaverage American family, would be en-titled to $1,600. This amount would besupplemented by State payments so thatno family would receive less under theact than it presently receives. Add to thisthe fact that welfare recipients will beable to obtain $16 worth of federallyfinanced food stamps for every $10 theyspend on the stamps, and it works outto an additional $800 or so in welfarebenefits. We are really, then talkingabout $2,400 In guaranteed benefits fora family of four, which is nothing more,nothing less than a guaranteed annualincome. Calling It an income mainte-nance floor does not change anything butthe name by which it is referred to.I am unalterably opposed to a guar-anteed annual income system. I believeIt would wreck our incentive system ofproduction, the system that couple withthe free enterprise system, has broughtthe United States tothe productiveheights it has achieved today. Peoplejust would not work, if they could getpaid for not working. This is not a blan-ket indictment, however, for some peo-ple would work anyway. But if people getsomethingfornothing,itgenerally would erode their will to work and con-tribute to society.Another objection I have to the pro-posed bill is that it would add about 15million new individuals to the welfarerolls. In my mind, this would not solveour welfare problem, it would just In-crease it.I also object to the $4.4 billion thatthe program will cost, and this Is lustfor the first year of its operation. I donot believe that this program would beexempt from the bureaucratic pressuresthat accompany all other Federal efforts,April 16, 1970pressures that turn small Federal pro-grams into gigantic ones, and minimalFederal expenditures into excessive andwasteful ones. This is the very nature ofthe bureaucratic process. And this is onechief reason why I believe the Govern-ment should keep its activities to thebare irreducible minimum.Moreover, I do not think that the Fed-eral Government should even considerspending $4.4 billion on a new welfareprogram when this Nation is locked ina titanic struggle with inflation. Partic-ularly when $2.1 billion will be allocatedjust to cover the welfare costs of the 15million new welfare recipients that willbe added by the act.Finally, while public assistance cer-tainly should be given the sick, the blind,the disabled, and the needy young, I donot think that public assistance shouldbe given to the working poor. By includ-ing them and restructuring the welfaresystem along the lines of a guaranteedincome approach, welfare is made morecomfortable and respectable rather thanless so. It gives it more of the color of a\"inalienable right\" rather than the truecolor of \"temporary maintenance\" as wasoriginally envisioned by the architects ofwelfare.I would think my colleagues couldprofit well by harking to the words ofthe father of the New Deal, PresidentFranklin D. Roosevelt. He said in 1935:The Federal Government must and shallquit this business of relief\u2014continued de-pendence upon relief induces a spiritual andmoraldisintegration,fundamentallyde- structive to the national fiber. To dole outrelief in this way is to administer a narcotic,a subtle destroyer of the human spirit.Mr. Chairman, I believe that the Fam-ily Assistant Act, despite all its rhetoricof workfare and job incentives, is ba-sically a program giving people \"some-thing for nothing.\" In my view, this isthe least effective way to help people helpthemselves.Mr. ASHBROOK. Mr. Chairman, I amnot going to take time in outlining whatI feel are some of the problems InvolvedIn this legislation and some of the short-comings but, rather, to raise some spe-cific questions. My basic objections havealready been summarized in the RECORD.Having worked with this for betterthan a month in trying to reduce thewritten legislation. Into actual dollars-and-cents figures, I can guarantee you Itis a very, very difficult thing to do. Itis going to be contingent. upon many dif-ferent interpretationsinthevariousStates and in HEW.Mr., Chairman, I think one of thebasic weaknesses I see in the program isthe argument that bringing the pro-gram to the Federal level will automati-cally straighten out all of the problemsIn the States. I think most of us findthat argument just a little bit hollow.We are never completely sure that HEWintends to carry out even the stated in-tentionoftheCongress,letalonestraighten out the problem.However, Mr. Chairman, I would liketo raise several specific questions and Iwould ask the able chairman of theCommittee on Ways and Means, the gen-t2einan from Arkansas (Mr. MILLS), for April 16,1970thepurpose of legislative history severalquestions.On page 33 of the committee reportthere is language whIch .1 think will bemost difficult to interpret. In the mid-dle of the page it says:1118 not Intended by your committee thatthese programs should provide assistancewhich would be supportive of firms or in-dustries which have high rates of turnoverof labor because of low wages, seasonalityor other factors.I would ask the able chairman whetheror not he has some concern in the ad-ministration of this program, and theregulationsthatwillcarryitout, whether or not this in effect would notin the future likely remove the tendencyfor employment security offices to referpotential workers in so-called work In-centive programs to what might be calledmarginal industries. These would in-clude hotels, motels, laundries and res-taurants which traditionally have beenlow-wage Industries. Does the gentlemansee any danger in putting language suchas this in the bill? Would its effect beto make it unlikely to refer people to suchlow-income industries?Mr. MILLS. If the entleman will yield,yes, I would not deny that there is someproblem. What we are trying to do in thereport, a& I am sure the gentleman in thewell knows, is to give some clarity or bet-ter guideline to the Department of Laborin the establishment of regulations asto the feeling of the committee, at least,about these matters.We do not want these people to beworking in just seasonal jobs if we canfind for them annual jobs. We do notwant to put them into all of these low-paying jobs, because we think some ofthem as a result of training, particularlythose that have as much as a high schooleducation, can be trained for better pay-ing jobs.Mr. ASHBROOK. But will the gentle-man agree that while It is the legislativeintent to encourage getting these peoplethe best jobs possible\u2014Mr. MILLS. That is right.Mr. ASHBROO}C. That It could verywell give some future bureaucrat fromthe Office of HEW or Labor the option ofsaying \"Wait, we are not going to sendthese people to the lower paying indus-tries such as restaurants, laundries, mo-tels, and hotels?\"Mr. MILLS. No. That is not Intended.Mr. ASHBROOK. Because these are,in the language of the Industries?Mr. MILLS. No.Mr. ASHBROOK. Everybody knowsthey are low-wage industries, theymight possibly form the only jobs avail-able to them.Mr. MILLS. If they were full-time jobsthey might conform.Mr. ASHBROOK. So it is not the in-tention of the committee to rule outsome what might be called future em-ployment in the low-wage industries?Mr. MILLS. We are not overlookingthe fact that some people may be as-signed to low-wage jobs, and they maynot be all assigned to a full-time annualjob In the very beginning.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014HOUSESome of them may have to take someseasonal jobs to begin with, but we hopethe bulk of them will not.Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin. I thinksince we might be trying to make a lit-tle legislative history, I think first ofall we do not rule out any job.Mr. MILLS. No. No; we do not.Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin. It is notour intention to exclude any jobs be-cause the whole thrust and purpose ofthis bill is to get people into a postureto help themselves. We want to make thejob basically compatible for that indi-vidual, but there Is nothing in the billthat says they can hold out for a highskilled job when there is a lower skilledopportunity available right now.Mr. MILLS. That is correct.Mr. ASHBROOK. I think the gentle-man Is correct. I certainly agree with theconcept and the desire, it is obvious thateverybody would like to be in high paidemployment, but I think some of us havefears that In the social climate In whichwe live, and possibly because of bureau-cratic regulations, there is a strong like-lihood that people will not be referred tojobs of this type simply because theyare at the lower rung of the economicladder.Mr. BYRNES-of Wisconsin. Chair-man, will the gentleman.Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin. That isone of the reasons we went Into detailon some of these criteria. We wanted tomake surethat theSecretarycould substitute his own subjective judgmentfor the intent of the committee and theCongress.If this person had very little work ex-perience or no work experience, then ofcourse he is going to have to take a lowerpaying job. He is going to have to take alower job consistent with his background.In other words, we do not rule out anyjobs. He has to recognize that while may-be the job that is open is not a particu-larly desirable job, the person who hasnot had that work or experience, can fillthat job and acquire work experience anddiscipline, that will enable himself toqualify for a better job in the future.Mr. ASHBROOK. I think the gentle-man Is certainly optimistic In his out-look. Having had a little more experiencewith HEW guidelines and Departmentof Labor guidelines, I would have to ob-serve somewhat facetiously\u2014I am afraidnot as facetiously as it might seem\u2014that I will sit back and wait for thevery first person who is denied his fam-ily assistance because he refused to accept one of these lower rung jobs. If thattime comes, I will frankly tell you thatyou are right and I am wrong\u2014but Iam not going to hold my breath untilthat happens, I will tell the gentleman.Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin. Let me sayfor the record that there is an addi-tional aspect of this that we had betterrecognize and that the Secretary of La-bor should recognize\u2014and I think hedoes. The entire work Incentive programhas two purposes. One Is the bettermentof the individual. But also there will bereduction in the cost of the program thatwill enable us to keep it within boundsH 3157when individuals work. We cannot con-tinue -the present program because Itdoes not encourage people to go to workat all. That is why the costs are runningup as much as they are. The Secretaryhas a definite obligation under this bill,not only as to the welfare of these in-dividuals, but also to he Treasury of theUnited States to see that these peopleget to work.Mr. ASHBROOK. I thank the gentle-man for that, and I appreciate the gen-tleman making that legislative history.I have one last question which I woulddirect to the distinguished chairman orthe ranking minority member.Again, consider one of the premisesthat I happen to believe is a little weakin argument__althoughI think whatthe gentleman from Arkansas and thegentleman from Wisconsin are sayingis accurate in concept.Most of us worry about how it is goingto work out in its actual implementation.One of the things I think is fairly weakin its premise is adding anywhere from11 to 13 million on what might be calledthe welfare rolls on the theory that theprogram will work and they will workthemselves off the welfare rolls. Anotherfaulty premise is that the program inthe long run will cost less.I would like to ask one specific ques-tion as to whether or not either thegentleman from Arkansas or the gentle-man from Wisconsin, either one, do nothave some -misgivings on these premises.Does the gentleman honestly feel thatover a reasonable period of time thesepeople, the 11 or 12 million people beingadded, will in fact work themselves offthe rolls?I think it Is clear that there is not astrong work incentive in this legislation.Anybody who has any doubt can look atpage E3226 of the RECORD of yesterday.If there is not a strong built-in workincentive, can we honestly build such asuperstructure on the theory tliat theywill work themselves off the rolls and thecoverage of this bill over a period oftime?Will the gentleman respond to that?Mr. MILLS. Yes, I will be glad to.No one, may I say to the gentleman,on the Committee on Ways and Means oranywhere in the Government can tell youwith any degree of precision that we willwork all of these people Into better pay-ing jobs or will work them all off ofwelfare.There are two reasons, in my opinion,why we are justified in offering the work-ing poor this incentive to take training.Those we are talking of largely are full-time employees which means they areworkIng 40 hours or more than 30 hoursa week. They apparently are not makingenough to provide the income for theirfamily sufficiently to provide them withthese basic necessities of life.There is the danger first that they mayfind out that their welfare program, Inthe state of Ohio or the State of NewYork or elsewhere, will pay them moremoney and give them more take-homepay than they can make while earning ona Job.If that is the threat, why do we not H 3158offer them this supplemental incomewhile they are working full time in re-turn for their taking training? In theory,it is good. I have said all the way throughthe success of the program depends en-tirely. in my opinion, on the attentionthat is given these Individuals on an in-dividual basis by the employment secu-rity agencies of all of our States, but Iwould not want to tell you that, I couldassure you. I do not believe anybodywould say that. But this is legislativelyan improvement, I think, In every way.The CHAIRMAN. The time of the gen-tleman from Ohio has expired.Mr. MILLS. Mr. Chairman, I yield tothe gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.WAGGONNER) such time as he desires.(Mr. WAGCONNER asked and wasgiven permission to revise and extend hisremarks.)Mr. WAGGONNER. Mr. Chairman, myAugust 196 newsletter was titled, \"FullScale Socialism for All Advocated in Ad-visory Council Recommendation.\" Theopening lines of that newsletter werethese:In a 148-page reoort the like of which noSocialist dreamer ever dared propose serious-ly before, a Committee of \"Great Society\"planners has recommended to the Secretaryof Health, Education and Welfare that aprogram should be undertaken immediatelyto provide every man, woman and child inthe United Statesa guaranteed annualincome.In August of 1966, this was only a rec-omniendation to the Johnson adminis-tration. Less than 4 years later, today,we find this is a proposal by the Nixonadministration. This dream of every So-cialist of having the Government guar-antee him an income is wrapped up in thebill we are now considering.As was to be expected, the minute thisguaranteed annual income feature wa,unveiled last year, the bandwagon start-ed to roll. The predictable gaggle of lib-erals, leftists, and radicals were, at first,astounded that a supposedly conserva-tive Republican administration was pro-posing national welfarism in a greatermagnitude than even the most liberalDemocrat in the history of the Nation.They regained their composure quickly,if not their intelligence, and began anoutpouring of statements, position papersand conferences calling for Increases thatstaggertheimagination and wouldempty the pocketbooks of the workingpublic. No sum, It seems, is too much totake from the pockets of the taxpayersand dole out to those unwilling to work.I used the word \"unwilling\" only aftermaking a careful choice among manywords, because anyone willing to worktoday, except for the lame, the halt andthe blind, can find a job by simply pick-ing up a newspaper and reading thebegging help wanted ads.The proposal before us calls for a cashdonation of $1,600 per year to every fam-ily of four in the United States whoseincome is under that figure, or whateverIt takes to reach that sum plus an addi-tional $860 in food stamps, for a total of$2,460, all of which Is, of course, tax free.And it must be remembered that this Isonly the beginning. ch year, the de-mand from the welfare receivers and theM' liberal represeptatlves in and outCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEof the Congress will be irresistible. Thefigures will climb with the regularity ofthe sun in the sky.This was made crystal clear by Mr.R. E. Patricelli, Deputy Assistant Sec-retary of Health, Education, and Wel-fare, when he addressed a meeting ofCatholic Charities of the Archd.iocese ofNew York late last year. He said:When the budgetary situation improves,we might look toward increases in the fed-eral base payment.He alsostatedthatthe program\"should be made universal,\" meaningthat childless and single personsshould also be included in the future.No one believes more than I that thepresent welfare system needs a massiveoverhaul. I agree with the Presidentwhen he says it is a failure. It has robbeda significant portion of the population oftheir will or interest in providing forthemselves; it has made them wards ofthe state. But what is needed is not anoverhaul which more than doubles thenumber now on the rolls as this proposalwould\u2014not an overhaul which adds an-other $4 '/2billionto the already stagger-ing burden of welfare costs as this pro-posal would.In the past 10 years, the number ofpeople receiving some form of relief as-sistance has Increased 52 percent and thecost of these programs has advanced 211percent. All of this in only 10 years. Itis now estlir.ated that the Federal, State,and local costs exceed $72 billion peryear.And, needless to add, each of these $72billion comes out of the pocket of thetaxpayers who work for their livelihood.Third- and fourth-generation familiesare now appearing on the welfare rolls,demanding higher and higher paymentsand less and less supervision of whatthey use the money for or whether ornot they are even eligible for the pay-ments. Welfare is, many now claim, their\"constitutional right,\" an attitude whichhas been upheld more than once recentlyby various courts. The traditional con-cept of welfare as temporary assistancefor those who are in need because ofreasons beyond their control, no longerexists.In an effort to soft-pedal the full,socialist impact of this proposal, theNixon administration is attempting tosell it as a \"work fare\" proposal. If Itwere this, it would be more acceptable,but an examination of the facts revealsthat the work requirements are almostnonexistent and those that do exist areunenforceable.There are presently 9,600,000 personsnow on welfare. Of these, exactly children; their moth-ers; 2,000,000 are aged; 728,000 are dis-abled; and 80,000 are blind. All of thesewould be exempt from work under ex-emptions provided by the Nixon proposal.This leaves 500,000\u2014or one-nineteenth\u2014who would be eligible for work. But, eventhen, there is another catch, These 500,-000 would be required to accept onlythose jobs which are, in the opinion ofthe Secretary of Labor, \"suitable.\" Wouldbe, some future Secretary or some liberaladviser or employment security officialconsider a job as a dishwasher \"suII-April 16, 1970ble\"? Or as a janitor, a lawncutter, maid,busboy, window cleaner or any of theother such manual labor jobs which theunemployed says are \"demeaning\"? Ifrankly doubt it.This program, like many Federal pro-grams, is offered up as the total answerto all the problems of the poor. Yet I can-not help but recall that, a few short yearsago, the so-called poverty program wassold to the Congress and the people asbeing the one sure way of ending povertyand welfare inthis Nation forever.Countless billions of wasted dollars later,the program is in a shambles, havingdone little for the poor but a great dealfor the manipulators of the poor and theleeches who feed off the misery of others.Other Impractical, visionary programshave likewise failed to live up to theirpublicity.This proposal, in the jubilant words ofliberal-leftist James Reston, \"proposesmore welfare, more people on public as-sistancethan has any other President inthe history of the Republic.\" It goes farbeyond the socialist's dream of provid-ing for each according to his needs. Thisproposal provides where there is no needand does not require that need even bedemonstrated.There is a need in this country for awelfare program, honestly administered,to assist the needy who are needy for nofault of their own, for the aged, the lame,the halt, and the blind, This kind of pro-gram I have supported and will alwayssupport. There is a need also for a pro-gram of temporary assistance for thewilling and able-bodied who cannot findjobs; a program that requires some formof public work in the interim to pay fortheir support by the public. But, in thistime of unparalleled prosperity, of jobscrying for workers, of opportunities forall regardless of race, sex, creed, or color,there is no justification for turning thisNation into a socialist welfare state.What's wrong with a guaranteed annualincome? Nothing, if you believe in social-ism. Everything, if, like me, you believeIn democracy and the free enterprisesystem.A number of items have appeared inthe press since this proposal was firstunveiled that I would like to include hereat the end of my remarks because it isvital to me that the record show thatthere was no doubt but that this Con-gress knew the road It wa taking thiscountry dowi when it enacted this legis-lation, It would be convenient, in yearsto come, for those who are going to votefor this bill to say they had no idea thatit would develop into what it will be be-fore many years go by. I want to closethat escape route so that every man whovotes for this proposal will have to ad-mit that the facts were on the table buthe chose to ignore them. These are theitems I have in mind.From the February 24, 1970. Review:Txx NIXON PLAN: THEWELFARE Mms(y Henry Hazlitt)Ironically, the staff of theHouse Ways and Means Committee, a groupcontrolled by the Democrats, has criticizedthe Republican Nixon welfare program chief-ly from a conservative point of view. April 16, 1970Thestaff analysis asserts that, by extend-ing welfare to working families, \"the gov-ernment, in a sense, would be telling a work-ing father that he is officially not capable ofsupporting his family at what the govern-ment believesis the necessary level. Onepossible reaction of some fathers may be tolet the government take over the job of com-pletingsupportinghisfamily.\"Another criticism is that when he looks, at how theplan applies to his family, a father \"maysoon realize that the only way for him toIncrease' his income is to have a larger fam-ilyA third criticism is that some fam-ilies might buy goods to reduce their cash as-sets, \"a color TV, for example.\" A fourth isthat 'government supplements to the wagesof the working poor could create a subsidizedpool of cheap labor to employers.\"This report, however, no doubt inspiredby Committee Chairman Wilbur D. Mills,by no means assures that the DemocraticCongress will flatly reject the Nixon plan.More likely it will put together a welfarepackage that the Democrats can call theirown, and outbid even the Nixon plan in totalcost.Because the President's proposal, whichhe first put forward on television on August8, was couched entirely in the rhetoric ofconservatism, many conservatives were mis-led, and it was weeks before the plan re-ceived effective criticism. By far the bestanalysis is the 23-page study put out by theAmerican Conservative Union. Among thepoiits it makes are these:The new plan makes it more comfortable tobe on welfare, both by eliminating any meanstest and by increasing benefits for many wel-fare clients while decreasing benefits fornone.Mr. Nixon proposes that the federal levelbe $1,600 for. a family of four with no out-side income, A family of ten would be eligibleto receive an income of $3,400 a year fromthe Federal Government, with any state al-lowance in addltibn,One great danger in federalizing welfareis the new opportunity it provides for mani-pulation by organized groups. Welfarists willbe able to eoncentrate all their pressuresdirectly on Washington. This very tactic hasoften been employed to force increases InSocial Security benefits and minimum wagelaws. Already the AFL-CIO and other pres-sure groups are attacking President Nixon'srecommendation of $1,600 maximum annualpayment to a family of four as totally in-adequate. They demand no less than a full$3,500, the minimum federal poverty levelincome.The program will more than double thenumber or welfare recipients, adding twelvemillion more to the nearly ten million al-ready on the rolls.It will cause an initial increase of $5 bil-lion in the federal budget, and perhapsdouble that.It was put forward as a \"workfare\" pro-gram, \"Everyone,\" said Mr. Nixon, \"who ac-cepts benefits must accept work or training,provided suitable jobs are available. ... The only exceptions Would be those unable towork and mothers of pIe-school children.\"But the ACU points out that after we deductthe blind, the disabled, the aged, the chil-dren and the mothers of pre-school ehildrenfrom the 9.6 million people nbw receivingaid, only about 500,000 or 5 percent, would berequired to accept work or receive job train-ing under the Nixon plan. Whether the workrequirement could be enforced even for these is more than doubtful, Already the pro-fessional welfare advocates are charging thatany work requirement would amount to \"In-voluntary servitude.\"The Administration itself has greatly ex-panded the program since it was announced.White House aides said at first that the Fam-ily Security plan would at least eliminatefood stamped A few months later they an-CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014HOUSEnounced that food stamps would not onlyremain, but that the annual appropriationfor them would be doubled. This means thateach family of four would not receive a fed-erally guaranteed annual inoome of $1,600(not counting state payments) but an addi-tional food stamp allotment bringing thetotal federally paid income to $2,380.The Nixon plan is in fact a \"guaranteedannual income.\" The President himself saidon December 8: \"All of us want the poor tohave a minimum floor (under their incomel,and that floor to be as high as possible.\" Inother words, a person who will not work hasa \"right\" to live permanently off the earningsof another man who can and does.To these cogent criticisms I would like toadd one point that has been generally ne-glected. Mr. Nixon deplores the wide state-by-state variations in relief payments. Heclaims as an outstanding merit of his planthat it would provide, if not uniformity, atleast a \"basic national minimum payment\"everwhere. But this overlooks the wide diver-genciesinprevailing income and livingstandards among the states. The 1960 censusshowed that the median money income offamilies in Connecticut was 138 per centgreater than of families In Mississippi\u2014orinversely, that the median income of Mis-sissippi families was only 42 per cent of thatof Connecticut families, with other statesdiverging within this range.This means that even a uniform minimumnational income guarantee that might dorelatively minor harm in California or theNortheast would be so high compared withprevailing earned incomes in the Deep Southas to tempt a third or more of the popula-tion to quit their jobs and climb aboardthe welfare wagon, or to draw supplementalhandouts, This could put a tremendousstrain on precisely the state budgets thatcould least afford it.A uniform minimum national welfare handout, in a nation with divergencies of upto 138 per cent in median earned family in-comes among the states, would create farmore serious problems than any it mightsolve.From the report, \"Solution or Social-ism,\" prepared by the American Con-servative Union:TN CONCLUSIONIn any evaluation of the Nixon welfareproposals, conservatives must look beneaththe rhetoric, to which they are eager to re-spond, and seek out the substantive purpose.Viewed in this light, the Nixon welfare re-form can be seen simply as a program whichwill snorethandouble the welfare rolls, andacid 12 million new recipients of Federal wel-fare payments to the nearly' 10 million a1ready on the rolls.The program will cause an Initial increaseof $5 billion in the Federal budget, half ofwhich will go to direct payments to welfarefamilies, old and new. This is a quantumjump in the number of welfare clients andin Federal spending on welfare.Though conservatives were almost alonea few years ago as critics of the welfaresystem, today everyone\u2014conservatives, lib-erals,radicals\u2014can agree with PzsidentNixon that \"nowhere has the failure of gov-ernment been more tragically apparent thanin its efforts to aid the poor, and especiallyin the system of public welfare,\" When onegets down to the philosophy behind thisstatement the conservative differs markedlyfrom the present day liberal or radical.President Nixon is proposing not only toexpand welfare, but also to establish it ona more legitimate footing by calling it \"fam-ily assistance\", eliminating the means test,and administering it through the Social Se-curity Administration. Only the inclusion ofa work requirement saves Nixon from ad-vocating the complete liberal package\u2014wel-fare as a right of any American.H 3159The Nixon program, despite its doubtlesssincere intentions, willin rungreatly exacerbate the \"welfare mess\" forthree basic reasons:(1) It makes welfare more comfortablewhen It should be made less comfortable.(2) By moving toward a guaranteed income,it makes welfare more respectable, more of a\"right\" when it should be made less respecta-ble. less of a \"right.\"(3) It drastically ,inceases the thus risking corrupting 12 millionmore American citizens,when desperateefforts ought to be made to decrease thenumber of persons receiving unearned checksfrom government.In a 1935 message to Congress, PresidentFranklin D. Roosevelt said: \"The Federalgovernment must and shall quit this busi-ness of relief\u2014continued dependence uponrelief induces a spiritual and moral disinte-gration, fundamentally destructive to thenational fibre. To dole out relief in this wayis to administer a narcotic, a subtle destroyerof the human spirit.\"While subsequent history showed thatFDR's fears were well-founded, few recallthat even he had begun his \"New Deal\" withJhe good intention of getting the governmentout of the \"business of relief.\" Today, fewwould doubt that President Nixon's inten-tions are the same\u2014to get people off welfare.Yet there is truth in a statement made bySecretary of Housing and Urban Develop-ment George Romney. In discussions aboutthe welfare program with President Nixon,the Secretary recalls that he told the Presi-dent,\"You shouldn'tjust handpeople things... theleast effective way to helppeopleisjust to give them something.\"Whether this proposition is true or false isperhaps the most important question thatthe Congress will have to decide in acting onPresident Nixon's welfare proposals in 1970.From the September 2 Issue of theNational Review Bulletin:AT HOME(By M, Stanton Evans)Will the \"new federalism\" proclaimed byPresident Nixon in the field of social welfarecure the Nation's relief problems or makethem worse?The Nixon program starts from a com-mendable awareness that the present welfaresystem has failed, and itis apparent thePresident and his advisers have given a gooddeal of thought to the various componentsof that failure. In particular, they havefocused closely on those aspects of the exist-ing system which draw people out of thework force rather than into it, and break upfamilies as a condition of relief payments.Whether the affirmative part of the Nixonpresentation will overcome these deficiencies.however, Is another question. Although thestated intention is to transfer as many peo-ple as possible from the welfare rolls to p061-tions of employment, the net effect of the\"new federalism\" as outiined by the Presidentand his subordinates could easily be the re-verse. As the Administration spokesmen ac-knowledge, everything depends on the effec-tiveness of various \"work incentives\" to bebuilt into the program.In it opening phases, the Nixon plan runsclearly counter to the \"less relief\" idea, sinceit Would cause ab estimated doubling of thenumber of people receiving assistance (fromten million to 22.4 million) and would almostdouble the cost (another $4 billion a year orso on top of the existing $5 billion). It is thisdevelopment which causes liberalJames Reston to rejoice, that Nixon \"proposes morewelfare, more people on public assistancethan any other President in the history ofthe republic.\"'l'be Nixon planners argue that the in-crease is only a short-term matter, that theupward relief cycle will be broken by the H 3160 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEApril 16, 1970\"work incentives,\" The success of the pro-graiti therefore rests entirely on these pro-visions, which include stepladder paymentswhereby a portion of relief funds will becontinued even if earned income is received,day-care centers to tend the children of wel-fare mothers who seek employment, and arequirement that able-bodied relief recipientsaccept offers of work or training, or else losetheir benefits.Examination of th data made available sofar suggests these incentives may not beenough to overcome the contrary push of in-creased payments and broadened coverage.Once guaranteed payments of $1,600 a yearfor a family of four are voted by Congress,the pressures for increasing the floor levelswill be enormous.It is indicative, in fact, that major criti-cisms of the Nixon proposal from the liberalsector have centered on the charge that pay-ment levels are not high enough\u2014that theplan doesn't do anything financially for re-lief recipients in big-city areas who are al-ready getting as much as or more than the\"floor\" Nixon is urging. Given the power andpersistence of the spending lobbies in manylocalities, it is probable that a drive will belaunched in the larger states to add the fed-eral guarantee money to high-level statebenefits, rather than substituting the federalfunds for them.This would create a fat schedule of bene-flt running strongly counter to the workincentive idea. Recipients who can get all ornost of the existing payments in certain big-city states, plus some portion of the federalmoney, would have less reason to seek em-ployment, not more. Such an arrangementwould, of course, also maintain the discrep-ancy between state payment levels whichthe program is supposed to eliminate. Asexplained by Nixon spokesmen in recent pressbriefings, there would be nothing to preventthis from occurring. The official prospectussimply says \"no state ... isrequired to spend more than 90%\" of its existing outlayin the covered categories.Add to these considerations the fact that\"family assistance\" does not affect the exist-ence of countless other welfare provisionsapart from aid to dependent children, theaged, the blind and the disabled. The Nixonguarantee, rather than becoming a completewelfare substitute as envisioned by Prof.Milton Friedman, would be laid on top of asystem containing countless subsidies andrestrictions which serve to discourage em-ployment. The documented effects of theminimum wage is pushing marginal workersout of jobs, and the obvious counterincen-tive of high unemployment payments, sug-gest the nature of this difficulty.Granted that the stepladder provisions foraid to the working poor would eliminate atleast one positive incentive to idleness, theabsence of negative incentives against idle-ness would be even more noticeable than itis today. This potential problem is accentu-ated by the fact that. under the Nixon pro-gram, there will be only perfunctory effortsto guar4 against fraud. Eligibility will bedetermined by a simple declaration from therelief recipient, Confirmed 'by occasional spotchecks.Finally, there is the question of the \"workrequirement\" provision which would denyassistance to anyone who did not accept ajob or training. Will Congress actually votea tough requirement to this effect? And ifit does, who is going to make the hard-nosedand possibly unjust decision that a givenindividual and his family be thrown out intothe cold for refusing offered opportunities?In short, the Nixon program would make itvirtually certain that the number of peoplereceiving relief payments in the relevantcategories would 'be more than doubled. Butwhether it would subsequently succeed inmoving these recipients Into the active workforce seems very uncertain indeed.From the January 31, 1970, issue ofHuman Events:FooT-IN-THE-DOoR WELFARE PLANJust days before President Nixon was tout-ing his No.1legislative priority\u2014welfarereform\u2014in his State of the Union message, akey Administration official revealed to a pro-welfare group in New York the truly revolu-tionary nature of the program. Moreover, thissame official indicated it would not only beextremely costly to the taxpayer, but that itspassage would probably be the first step to-ward an even greater outpouring of lavishwelfare benefits\u2014an outpouring that theNixon Administration appears to actuallywelcome.Though this official didn't exactly say so,the thrust of his remarks suggests the Nixonpackage is designed to clear the way fora complete federal takeover of welfare andthe start of a guaranteed annual income forevery person that falls below the upwardspiraling \"poverty line.\"Speaking to a meeting of the CatholicCharities of the Archdiocese of New York,Robert E. Patricelli, deputy assistant secre-tary of health, education and welfare andthe Administration's chief lobbyist for themeasure, frankly acknowledged the mam-moth size of the \"reform\" package.\"The total cost in new dollars ofthe stated\u2014and some thinkvastly understated\u2014\"is $4.4 billion per year,and the coverage under the Family Assistanceportion of the program will be some 25 mil-lion people\u2014up from the present 10 millionrecipientsI emphasis oursWhile the common conception is that thefederal government will provide only $1,600yearly to a family of four, Patricelli pointedout that to \"that $1,600 base must also beadded the expanded food stamp subsidieswhich the President has proposed and whichthe Administration has already moved to im-plement as much as possible by administra-tive action. Under that program, a family offour receiving $1,600 in Family Assistancebenefits would also receive about $860 infood stamp subsidies for a total package of$2,460 in federal income maintenance pay-ments\" And all this, of course, is to be sup-plemented by state payments.Yet, suggested Patricelli, this was Just thebeginning. \"First and quite properly,\" he re-marked, \"our critics point out that the Fam-ily Assistance Plan is not universal in itscoverage. It does not provide federal assist-ance to non-aged childless couples or singlepersons. But that omission in the plan tracesnot to any disagreement in principle withthe need to cover such persons, but ratherto the need to accommodate to what we hopewill be short-term budgetary limitations.\"Within the $4.4 billion available, we choseto place our emphasis upon families withchildren, but there is no disagreement inprinciple that the system should be madeuniversal when resources permit.\"Second, said Patrioelii, \"critics point outthat $1,600 for a family of four is far fromadequate. That, too, 18 certainl4v the caseand we have never suggested that the FamilyAssistance Plan provides a guaranteed ade-quate income. It does, however, when com-bined with food stamps, provide over two-thirds of the amount up to the povertyline....Again,when and if the budgetarysituation improves, we might look towardincreases In the federal base payment.\"Thus,evenbeforethelegIslationis launched,Administration spokesmen aresellingthe program tO welfare pr'seuigroups\u2014those that oan effectively lobby Oongress\u2014by stressing that the Nixon w\u00e9l-fare package Is Just a foot-in- the-door pro-posaLContrary to initial impressions conveyedby the Nixon Administration, furthermore,the new welfare program is a giant leapaway from the President's concept of a\"New Federalism\" that would r'turn powersto the states. Patricelli himself thinks thewelfare system \"should ultimately be fullyadministered by the federal government andfinanced wholly or in major part by thatlevel of government.\" Financial \"incentives\"in the N1on proposal, in fact, would help\"persuade\" the state governments to turnover their own welfare programs to the fed-eral Social Security Administration.\"This would be,\" said unprecedented arMngementin federal-state relations\u2014an upstream dele-gation by the states to the federal govern-ment for the administration of a whollystate-financed program.\"Nor does this exhaust the astonishingaspects of this proposal. A central featureof the President's initiative that had. a cer-tamappeal to the public was the \"work-fare\"formularequiringallable-bodied welfare recipients(excepting mothers ofpre-school children) to accept etther train-ing or suitable jobs so they could workthemselves off welfare.Yet this ingredientisfarlessrevolu- tionary than originally believed, for a simi-lar \"workfare\" formula is continued in thecurrent welfare program, the Aid to Familieswith Dependent Children (?DC).Under 1967 amendments to the Social Se-curity Act, mothers in the AFDC programwere to seek work training. The legislationprovides that an attempt be made to findjobs for those who are employable and thatthose in need of training be trained andgiven $30 a month as incentive payment.Those who refuse to accept work or under-take training are to lose their welfare bene-fits. The legislation also provides 80 per centfederal matching funds for the cost of thework training program and day-care centersfor pre-school children of mothers in train-ing or on jobs.Despite these supposed \"workfare\" provi-sions, however, the number of persons onAPDC has increased substantially and thefederal contribution has soared more than$500 million. Patricelli himself told HumanEvents -that these provisions \"hadn't workedasw,ellasanybodywantedthemto workThe Administration proposal, nevertheless,is deliberately designed to weaken the. exist-ing workfare formula. Many people, saysPatricelli, have criticized-the inclusion in theNixon welfare plan of the \"work requirementwhich they feel is regressive and punitive,\"In fact, says Patricelli, \"President Nixon'swork requirement does represent a significantliberalizationof the similar requirementfound in the present law, for it does exemptwomen with children under six from itsoperation, and it doss require that jobs pro-vided be 'suitable', under guidelines to beestablished by the secretary of labor.\"As Patricellisuggests, then, the Nixon\"workfare\" proposal, under the guidance ofa secretary of labor and a juggling of theword \"suitable,\" will actually make it lesscompelling for a welfare recipient to take ajob and more easy for him to take welfarethan the current law provides\u2014even thoughthe current law has also failed to preventthe mushrooming of welfare rolls.In short, President Nixon appears intenton fastening upon the nation and his partyone of the costliest welfare programs everdevised. Thus, Human Evei,ts readers are ad-vised to write their congressmen and tellthem they are opposed to this \"welfare re-form\" package. Do the Republicans, it shouldbe asked, wish to be known as the \"welfare\"party, the party that added 15 million peopleto the relief rolls?From the March 24, 1970, issue Review':DEEPER A5O STILLPresident Nixon's everyone: more April 16,1970moneyfor those on welfare, larger welfarerolls and higher taxes for the nation, andtrouble for the Republican Party. Little won-der that the liberals of the House Demo-cratic Study Group have lined up behind thebill;little wonder that Democrat WilburMills has suddenly decided that it is a finething, eminently deserving of his servicesas floor manager now that it has been ap-proved by his Ways and Means Committee.Time was when the Nixon welfare plan had,or seemed to have, something for conserva-tives as well. When the plan was unveiledlastAugust.conservatives welcomed it\u2014because it was Richard Nixon's and becauseit seemed to be a giant step toward dis-mantling the existing Charles Addams wel-fare edifice and replacing it with somethingsane, realistic and workable. But it soon be-came apparent that after all,all that was contemplated was the adding of yet anotherwing\u2014and that(Inliberal Hugh Scott'sphrase) the conservatIves were getting therhetoric while the liberals got the action.Conservatives were soon reminded of one oftheir own first principles: That governmentprograms tend inevitably to grow in size andcost. On August 8, Nixon stated clearly that'for dependent families there will be anorderly substitution of food stamps by thenew direct monetary payments.\" By Au-gust 19, a member of the Presidential staffwith a vested interest In the continuation ofthe food stamp program was saying \"bothI food stamps and income supplements] areessential and will continue together for sometime.\" Came the autumn, and food stampswere officially back in; came the 1971 budget,and the Administration was asking that theappropriatIon for them be doubled. Sim-ilarly, Nixon began by calling for a minimum$65 monthly payment to the blind, aged anddisabled. When the bill embodying his wel-fare plan was drawn up, the minimum wasfound to have jumped to $90. By the timethe bill cleared Ways and Means, the figurewas $110.Indeed, when stripped of rhetoric about\"workfare\" and \"family assistance,\" the Nix-on welfare plan emerges as an extension ofthe present non-system. Where ten millionpeople now receive $5 billion annually Infederal welfare payments, 25 million will re-ceive at least $10 billion. And no one, liberalor conservative, will seriously contend thatthose antes will not be upped considerablyin years to come. \"Work incentives\"? Whenthe aged, the disabled and mothers of pre-school children are subtracted from the tenmillion now on relief, about 500,000 able-bodied unemployed are left; work incentiveand training programs aimed at those 500,-000 have so far resulted in a mere handfulworking themselves off the relief rolls. Help-ing the \"working poor\" (fifteen million ofwhom will receive government checks if theNixon plan becomes law)? But many poorpeople who have hitherto managed to sup-port themselves will decide, once the checksstart coming in, to let the government carrythe whole load. Most important, the prin-ciple will have been established once andfor all that welfare Is a way of life, a per-manent condition, rather than a temporaryleg-up.And so Democrats will support the welfarebill\u2014liberal Democrats, because it continues,on an enlarged basis, the system they loveso well; all Democrats, because Nixon's wel-fare plan can only damage his standing withthe job-holding, taxpaying majority thatelected him. So far, most Republicans arelining up obediently, because the bill is aRepublican President's. National Review re-gretfully Joins others in the conservativemainstream in urging the defeat of this wel-fare scheme\u2014on grounds that its passagewill be a victory that neither the Presidentnor the nation can afford.Mr. BYRNESofWisconsin. Mr. Chair-CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlemanfrom Iowa (Mr. SCHERLE).(Mr. SCHERLE asked and was givenpermission to revise and extend his re-marks.)Mr. SCHERLE. Mr. Chairman, I fa-vored an open rule on H.R. 16311 becauseI believe there are simply too many un-answeredquestionssurroundingthe Family Assistance Act of 1970.My primary concern about the legisla-tion is its workability. President Nixonlast February told the National Gover-nors Conference here in Washington thatthe family assistance program, and Iquote here \"has never been tried, nottried on a national basis. I cannot guar-antee that the new family assistance pio-gram will work,\" he told the Governors.As a matter of fact, a check by my of-flee with the Department of Labor hasrevealed that there will be no pilot pro-gram on the family assistance programuntil August of this year when the entireState of Vermont will be used as a FAPguinea pig. In other words, Mr. Chair-man, the passage of this sweeping wel-fare reform message was asked of Con-gress 1 year before a pilot study of theprogram was instituted to see if it wouldwork. Thus, in effect, we are asked to.hopaboard a plane which has never beenflight-tested.There has been a work incentive pilotprogram conducted in New Jersey tostudy the effect of Federal supplementson the so-called working poor. But thisstudy did not address itself to the keyquestion; that is, how many of those peo-ple receiving Federal payments In theNew Jersey project ultimately workedthemselves entirely off the welfare roll.T asked OEO, \"Who paid for the study?\"and was told that the data had not beencomputed and anyway It was \"irrele-vant.\"Another note on work Incentives. TheWhite House recently sent out a bookletentitled \"The Family Assistance Plan:Questions and Answers.\" In this was stated that FAP remediesthe present WIN\u2014work incentive\u2014pro-gram in six ways, It then went on toenumerate the ways. I am a bit puzzledas to how anyone at this point knowswhat improvements to make on the pres-ent WIN program since an official gov-ernment evaluation of the 1967 workincentive program is not due until July1 of this year. Thus It seems that anyprogram built upon a new, improvedWIN program is on very shaky groundsince we do not yet fully understand theinadequacies of the program which isbeing improved.Two other areas which I believe requiremuch more debate are the cost and thecoverage of this program.While we have been most solemnly as-sured that the \"startup\" costs of this pro-gram will be $4.4 billion, the record isrepletewithGovernmentprograms whose costs have skyrocketed out of sight.A few examples:Medicare. A headline In the April 3,1970, Wall Street Journal tells us: \"Hos-pitals To Get Higher Payments UnderMedicare.\" The story says that underheavy pressure from hospitals, the SocialSecurity Administration has decided toliberalize its payments to hospitals andH3161nursing homes to the tune of an extra$60 million for fiscal 1970.If you will recall, in 1965 it was esti-mated that medicare's hospital insurancefor the elderly would cost $3.1 billion in1970. Latest estimates now that 1970 ishere stand at about $5.8 billion. In 1946,old-age and survivors pensions undersocial security were forecast at $5 billionfor 1970. Actual costs will be about $27billion.The Federal highway system. A Li-brary of Congress study has shown thatthe first estimates of this program werereported in 1948 to be $11.3 bilUon. In1956, when the means of financing thesystem were changed, the total cost was$37.6 billion. In 1968, the estimated totalcost of the system was put at $56.5 bil-lion. At the present time revised esti-mates forthetotalcostarebeing prepared once again.The way welfare costs tend to grow hasbeen written about most interestingly byHarvard professor of government, Ed-ward C. Banfleld, In a recent article inthe publication the Public Interest. Pro-fessor Banflelcl noted:Those w'ho decide about the funding of awelfare system naturally base their decisionson estimates of the number of persons whowill be eligible and will apply for benefitsunder its 'terms. Characteristically they un-derestimate these numbers seriously. Theyfail to realize that the substantial increaseof benefits may induce many people to takesteps\u2014.often simple ones that do not con-stitute \"chiseling\" by any stretch of theimagination\u2014ito reduce their incomes enoughto make themselves eligible. They tend toassume that the percentage of eligibles ac-tually applying will be no greater in the f U-ture than in the past. As a result of theseerrors, the demand for welfare frequentlyexceeds the amount of funds available anda \"crisis\" exists. Obviously the \"crisis\" couldeventually be met by 4ncreasing approp\u00b1ia-tions If benefit levels were not allowed to risefurther. In praotice, however, they are allowedto rise, perhaps at an even 'aster rate thanappropriations, and so the \"crisis\" grows.One need not belabor the point here.We are all familiar with the propensity ofGovernment programs to grow.Now, how many people will be added tothe welfare rolls by FAP? Again there aredoubts.U.S. News & World Report, In an ar-ticle on the family assistance program,quotes the White House estimate at 12.4million\u2014In addition to the 10.1 millionnow on the rolls\u2014Jbut says \"other Gov-ernment agencies have sharply differentsets of figures.\"Indeed, In a speechto a Catholiccharity group in New York City, one ofthe brain trust behind the family assist-ance program Indicated that the planshould be expanded as soon as the budgetwould allow.Responding to criticism that FAP wasnot universal enough In its coverage,Assistant Secretary of Health, Education,and Welfare Robert Patricelli said, andI quote:Omission in the plan traces not to anydisagreement in principle with the need tocoversuchpersons(non-agedChildless couples and single persons), .but rather tothe need to accommodate what we hope willbe short-term budgetary limitations.IT] here is no disagreement that the systemshu1d be macfe universal when resourcespermit. H 3162 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEApril 16,1970Mr. Patricelli, in that same speech, alsostated that when and if the budgetarysituation improves, quote:We might look toward increases in theFederal base payment.How -muchmoreuniversalityis planned when the budgetary conditionimproves? How much will the base pay-ment be increased? At this point, we donot know. But it should be investigated.Another vital question on which wemust have an unequivocal answer is:Does the family assistance program con-stitute a guaranteed annual income?Again, to quote from the White Housepamphlet, we are told that it does not.But there are disturbing indications thatIt is at least a large step in that direction.In a speech to the National JewishWelfare Board, the spiritual mentor be-hind FAP, Dr. Daniel P. Moynihan, de-scribed the family assistance program,and I quote:Simply put, itis a proposal to place afloor under the income of every Americanfamily. Whether the family is working or not.United or not. Deserving or not.The press has also described the pro-gram as a guaranteed annual income.Knight newspaper reporter James K.Batten, in a story about FAP in theBuffalo Evening News, wrote:We seem to be on the brink of a guaranteedincome for all families.How could it happen under a Repub-lican President? Batten explained:The main reason seems to be this: A Pres-ident like Richard Nixon. whose conserya-tive credentials are In good order, is able tobring off a radical reform more easily thana liberal President like Mr. Johnson. Conser-vative critics would have shrieked that Mr.Johnson, always a suspect liberal, had finallygone off the deep end with a wild, left-wingsoheme guaranteeing handouts to every-body. But nobody can accuse Mr. Nixon ofbeing a wild-eyed radical.Syndicated columnist Roscoe Drum-mond, ScienceMonitor, FAP, quote, \"a signifi-cant stride toward a guaranteed annualmcome.\"The Chicago Tribune, which originallyspoke favorabley of the family assistanceprogram,editorialized on March 30, quote:The \"work incentive\" element of PresidentNixon's welfare reform proposal was intro-duced as a sugar coating for the guaranteedannual income pill.Another aspect of FAP which I thinkshould be more fullydiscussed,Mr. Chairman, is how eligibility will be de-termined. As I understand it, spot checkswill be conducted of recipients on a ran-dom basis much like the IRS checks tax-payers. I do not believe this is sufficient.Examples of high rates of welfare in-eligibility abound:A recent statewide audit of the Cali-fornia AFDC rolls revealed an ineligibil-ity rate of some 15 percent, representinga loss of $59 million a year.A 1969 GAO check of AFDC rolls inNew York City showed 10.7 percent ofthe families ineligible and 34.1 percentreceiving overpayments. The combina-tion of these two amounted to about a $74million loss yearly just In the city.Mr. Chairthan, there is currently a con-troversial little ditty making the roundsentitled \"Welfare Cadillac.\" One of theverses goes something like this:But things are still gonna get better, atleast that's what I understand.They tell me this new President has putin a whole new poverty plan.Well, I for one, do not share the op-timism of the songwriter that this wholenew poverty plan is going to make thingsbetter. And it is for this reason that I-again urge that the family assistanceprogram be debated more fully andbrought to the floor .of the House of Rep-resentatives under an open rule.WORKFARE OR WELFARE?Practically no one has a kind word tosay about the current welfare system. Itis costly and complicated to administerdemeaning to its recipients, and oftenineffectual to help them.President Nixon's decision to attempta complete overhaul of the system wastherefore greeted with approval in mostquarters. Many people evinced consider-able enthusiasm for the basic aims ofthe proposed reforms. The administra-tion hopes: First, to eliminate- much ofthe bureaucratic redtape connected witha multitude of separate assistance pro-grams, replacing them with a single in-come payment, and second, to provide atthe same time an incentive for the headsof welfare families to work. These areundeniably admirable goals. But the me-chanics of their implementation raisesome serious questions about their effec-tiveness.The core of the administration's planis the replacement of the aid to familiesof dependent children\u2014AFDC\u2014programby a single annual grant to each family:$500 for each adult and $300 for everychild, or $1,600 for a family of four. Witha total of 6.6 million recipients receiving$3.5 billion, the present AFDC programaccounts for fully two-thirds of the na-tional welfare case load. It is also thefastest growing of all welfare programs.The rest of the President's proposalsare intended to insure the effectivenessof the first. -Day-carecenters for chil-dren and training programs for adultsare designed to make it possible for wel-fare mothers to work. All able-bodiedwelfare recipients, except the mothersof preschool children, will be required toaccept suitable employment, if available,as a condition for receiving financial aid.A cash bonus of $30 a month for enroll-ing in training programs furnishes anadded incentive.On the surface this sounds like a pack-age with something for everybody: Aguaranted minimum income to please theliberals, and a simplified administrationplus a work incentive plan to placate theconservatives. Upon closer examination,however, it appears that there are manypitfalls in the new arrangement.The House Ways and Means Commit-tee approved the bill and sent it to theHouse floor as a complete package; thatis, not subject to amendment. Severalchanges were made in the bill in coin-nilttee, but they do not substantiallyalter the proposals. They do tend, how-ever, to increase the Federal share ofthe financial burden.The main thrust of the reform pro-gram remains centered around a guaran.teed minimum Income or benefit floor of$1,600 for a family of four, supplementedby Federal food stamps and State grants.Marginal earnings would not disqualifythe members of the family for relief.They would remain eligible for welfarepayments on a gradually decreasing scaleuntil their income exceeded the povertyline\u2014$3,500 annually for a family of four.Thus the head of a welfare family wouldhave a-n incentive to work even whileon welfare..This plan contains a number of hiddendrawbacks. First, it would greatly ex-pand the welfare rolls, from approxi-mately 11 to about 22 million. This wouldamount to 11 percent of the country'stotal population. Included under the newplan for the first time are working poor;that is, all those families whose incomeis less than $3,500 a year.Then, too, the guaranteed minimumincome is not intended to exclude otherforms of assistance, but only to providea floor for them. The Federal food stamlprogram will be continued. A family offour, for example, would receive an ad-ditional $750 worth of stamos, bringingtheir income up to about $2,350 a year.The States are also encouraged by meansof a revenue-sharing program to supple-ment the minimum payment.The administration estimates that thecost of its reform will be $4.4 billion In the first year. One economist believes itcould rise as high as $10 billion. ManyMembers of Congress fear that It willexceed the oflicial estimate by at least$1 billion, if not more.There is considerable concern in somequarters that the centralization of thewelfare function under the Social Se-curity Administration could result inmore complicated bureaucracy, not less,despite the proposed simplification of in-vestigatory procedures. All that will berequired of a welfare applicant underthe new system Is an income statement.Pollowup investigations willbe con- ducted as spot checks only. In itself, thisprovision could cost the tacpayer con-siderably in unauthorized welfare pay-ments.The work incentive portion of the planraises questions, too. It has not beendemonstrated to most people's satisfac-tion that the Incentives are sufficientllstrong to Induce those whowould nolotherwise work to seek employment.Presumably the heads of working poorfamilies are already earning as much asthey can. Under the Nixon plan, a wageearner is allowed to keep a portion ofevery dollar he earns over $750 until hisincome passes the poverty line.Further, since most of the people nowon welfare are either young children,their mothers, or the old or disabled, thework requirement would actually applyto a mere fraction of the welfare rolls,some 500,000 recipients. It these appli-cants refuse to accept suitable employ-ment, they would forfeit their portion ofthe allotment only. That is their depend-ents would still be entitled to their pay-ment. Thus the hypothetical family offour could receive $1,100 plus their foodstamps even if the father refused towork. April 16,1970Thedefinitionof suitable employ-ment, moreover, is anyone's guess. It Isnot clear whether the administrationmeans \"employment for which the ap-plicant is qualified,\" or whether moresubjective leeway is to be allowed in thedefinition and the applicant is to decidefor himself what constitutes a suitablejob.In view of the problems and ambigui-ties inherent in the present proposals, itis doubtful whether such refo\u00f1ns wouldreally improve the welfare mess. It ismuch more likely that they would onlyadd to the confusion. I am thereforewriting to Secretary of Health, Educa-tion, and Welfare, Robert H. Finch,. toask him to clarify the administration'sposition. Unless he can give some assur-ance that these problems will be solved,I cannot support this bill.Mr. MILLS. Mr. Chairman, I yieldsuch time as he may consume to thegentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. OBEY).(Mr. OBEY asked and was given per-mission to revise and extend his re-marks.)Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, I associatemyself with the remarks of the gentle-man from Arkansas, the distinguishedchairman of the committee on yester-day. It seems to me that was one of themost enlightening descriptions of thisproposal Which I have seen anywhere.Mr. Chairman, the present welfaresystem Is in drastic need of overhaul,and the legislation proposed by thePresident and reported by the Ways andMeans Committee would be an Improve-ment over present law.Nonetheless, I have some misgivingsabout what we are being asked to erect inIts place. For one thing, It will cost con-siderably more than the President hasestimated, in my judgment.For another, the family assistanceplan looks more like a cash-food-workprogram than a work-food-cash pro-gram, and for that reason none of usshould be overly optimistic about It.This proposal has been touted in somequarters as a workfare plan, but that isa misnomer. It is actually a guaranteedcash income plan, and I am concernedabout its adequacy as a means of Identi-fying and providing jobs.The family assistance plan requires ahead of household to take a job or enlistIn a job-training program, provided asuitable one is available. This is a workincentive notion, and the Office of Eco-nomic Opportunity claims it has evi-dence that work incentives do whattheory contendi they will.If the President really believes this evi-dence confirms his approach as theright one, then I will support him in it.I believe we may need a greater em-phasis on job training aid job oppor-tunities. There are several manpower de-velopment proposalsinthe House\u2014among them, a bill I am cosponsoringwith the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.O'HARA).Ourwelfare system is in great need ofOverhaul, and I will certainly not standin the way of efforts to improve it. Forthat reason I will support the President'sproposal. It Is an improvement over pres-ent law, and I congratulate the PresidentCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014HOUSEand the members of the Ways and MeansCommittee for taking the first step to-ward welfare reform.But after it passes, I would hope thatthe President will back legislation tobeef up this country's manpower develop-ment program. I regard welfare reformas a two-step process.The first is a better and soundly ad-ministered welfare system, and the sec-ond is a strong and much improved man-power training program. We need both ifwe are to effectively reduce our welfarerolls.Mr. MILLS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 10minutes to the distinguished gentlemanfrom Mississippi, the chairman of theRules Committee (Mr. COLMER).Mr. COLMER. Mr. Chairman, I thankthe gentleman from Arkansas for yield-ing me this time, which I chose ratherthan to use time I could have had underthe rule. I am grateful, I repeat, to thegracious gentlemen of the Ways andMeans Committee for yielding me thistime.Mr. Chairman, I wish I had the capa-bility, I wish I had whatever It requires\u2014-I shoifld say maybe the ability of theable gentleman from Arkansas, for whomI have the greatest admiration\u2014to ex-press my feelings about this proposal wehave here today.Unquestionably It is the most contro-versial, it is the most important, it isthe most complex and disturbing pieceof legislation that I have had occasion toconsider possibly In my whole career hereas a Member of this body.I am very much disturbed about thisbill. I am very much disturbed about thethreat that it poses to our system of gov-ernment, to our way of life.I am more disturbed about this whenI realize that my able friend from Ar-kansas is one of the chief proponents ofthis bill, as well as my friend the President of the United States, for whom Ialso have a very high regard and muchrespect. When these two gentlemen ad-vocate this type of legislation It does notnecessarily mean that I am casting anyreflections or aspersions on either ofthem, and certainly that Is not the pur-pose of my remarks.But here we have one of the greatestinnovations that has ever been proposedin the domestic affairs of this Govern-ment of ours. What we do here Is to pro-pose that we are going to guarantee\u2014and nobody can deny that\u2014to everyworking man, a man who is willing towork, a guaranteed income, under con-ditions of family life such as the figuresthat are used of a family of man andwife and two children, which the ablechairman and most of the Members ofthe committee have placed at $1,600 ayear.One member ofthedistinguishedWays and Means Committee says thatthat is an error. He says that It is $2,600.I do not know who is right, but the prin-ciple is there regardless of the amount.Now, as disturbed as I api about thethreat that this philosophy of legisla-tion poses to our country, I recognize,and other Members have to recognize,that this is just the beginning. We haveseen these programs enacted here by theCongress with popular political appea'H 3163time after time on a modest level, andyet we have never seen one of them re-pealed, nor have we ever seen one main-tained at that level. They are always ac-celerated. The demands are ever greaterand greater, and the Congress succumbsto them.Now, this utopian proposal is made ata time when the administration is talk-ing about a surplus in the budget. Itmust be obvious to all who observe theadditional costs of this and other pro-grams, old and new, that we will nothave a surplus nor a balanced budgetbut, on the contrary, we will again putthe Government's budget in the red.Again. Mr. Chairman, one member ofthe Ways and Means Committee, whovoted against the bill in committee, esti-mates that 43 percent of the budget nowis for welfare as against 34 percent fornational defense, even with the Vietnamwar going on. All of this adds up to moreand more inflation when the greatestproblem confronting our people is infla-tion. No one can successfully contendthat to the contrary.I say that this thing, like all of theothers that have been established, willgrow, just as the fictional Topsy grewon schedule.Now, what is the cost of It? Well, thathas been discussed here today as it wasyesterday. Frankly, I do not know whatthe cost is. I might add that frankly Ido not believe anybody else knows whatthe cost is going to be, not even theproponents of the bill, because everyonewho has discussed this matter in mypresence, either on the Committee onRules or on the floor of this House, hassaid that it was difficult to estimate andan estimate was the only way you couldarrive at a figure. The best and the lowestestimate that has been made is $4.5 bil-lion additional cost\u2014and if I am notcorrect about this, I would like to becorrected\u2014over the present program forthe fiscal year that this goes into effect.This will be a minimum of $4.5 billion.There are estimates of up to $10 billionover the present cost of this program.Again I want to emphasize that this Isbut the beginning.Mr. Chairman, this is a political body.Thank God it comes up for reelectionevery 2 years. I am talking about theHouse. I have never subscribed to thetheory that the House of Representativesshould have more than 2 years, because Ithink, as the Founding Fathers thought,that the people should have an opportu-nity every 2 years, if I may use an ex-pression of my own, to turn the rascalsout.Mr. GROSS. Mr. Chairman, will thegentleman yield?Mr. COLMER. I yield to my good friendfrom Iowa.Mr. GROSS. First, I want to commendthe gentleman from Mississippi for hissplendid remarks. The gentleman neverceases to warn the House of the financialperil that is facing this country. Yester-day the chairman of the Committee onWays and Means, Mr. MILLS, was askedthe question, \"Where are you going toget the money to pay for these additionalbillions of costs of this legislation? Doyou propose to raise taxes?\" The gentle-man from Arkansas (Mr. MILLS), said H 3164 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEApril 16,1970that he did not propose to sponsor a billincreasingtaxes. Now, whereisthe mofley to come from to finance thisvastly expanded program, and when isit expected we return to some financialsanity in this Government, either bystopping the expansion of programs orabandoning some of the programs al-ready in existence? It cannot be bothways.The CHAIRMAN. The time of thegentleman has expired.Mr. MILLS. Mr. Chairman, I yield thegentleman 5 additional minutes.Mr. COLMER. I thank my friend, theable chairman, for this additional time.Let me say to my friend from Iowaand to any and all others who might beinterested that there is an old trite say-ing that we still are operating under asystem Where the people have to supportthe Government and the Governmentcannot support the people.Mr. Chairman, there Is Only one wayfor the Governmept to get money withwhich to pay for these appealing pro-grams and that is through taxes.Now, we are confronted here with anational debt .greater than all the restof the free world put together. We willbe faced before the final gavel is soundedhere in this Congress with a request toincrease that national debt limitation.We have scheduled a repeal of the sur-tax. The gentleman from Iowa and mostof the others who give thought to thissubject know that If we continue withthese programs, even with this program,that we are not only going to have a sur-plus as the administration hopes, butwe are going to be in the red again andwe are going to have to retain all ofthe present taxes and probably add more.Mr. COLLIER. Mr. Chairman, will thegentleman yield?Mr. COLMER. I would be happy toyield to my friend, but my time is ratherlimited. Would the gentleman make hisquestion brief?Mr. COLLIER. I shall do so.What will the present program cost10 years from now? Does anyone know?I do not know.Mr. COLMER. I am not an expert inthis field. I would prefer that the gentle-man ask someone on the Ways andMeans Committee that question.Now, Mr. Chairman, the whole thrustand the objective of this bill is placed inthe pious hope that this bill is going toput people to work and take them offwelfare. Well, that is a nice thought andI think everyone of us would subscribe tothat 100 percent. But I challenge thatthat will be done under this bill.I do not have time to go Into that, butthere are entirely too many loopholes inthis thing as to how you are going tomake it work and get off welfare. Are yougoing to train a man for a job that doesnot exist, for instance?Are you going to train a man for a jobthat is in another area? Is the Govern-ment going to take these people andremove them from Colorado to New Yorkor some other State? It just simply Isnot going to work. The best that you cansay for it Is that there is a great grayarea in there where it is impractical forit to work.Now, let me say that with deference toall and disrespect for none.I tried my best in my limited way andcapacity as chairman of the Rules Com-mittee, No. 1, to see that hearings werecontinued there for a reasonable timeso that the people, the Congress particu-larly, would have an opportunity to knowwhat was in this bill other than thepresent and appealing slogan of takingpeople off the dole and putting them onthe payroll.The CHAIRMAN. The time of thegentleman from Missi3sippi has againexpired.Mr. MILLS. Mr. Chairman, I yield thegentleman 3 additional minutes.Mr. COLMER. I thank the distin-guished chairman of the Committee onWays and Means and I appreciate thevery gracious action of the chairman.Mr. Chairman, I confess that I haveused my best efforts to see that our com-mittee had unusuallyextensiveand thorough hearings on this bill which Iregard as containing many inequities andimpracticalitles. I feel that we have suc-ceeded at least to a degree. I thinkthe public, and particularly this House,have benefited from those hearings. Atthe risk of seemingly being guilty of self-serving statements, I would like to addthat I used my best efforts to bring thisbill out under a modified closcd rule,realizing that an open rule under presentcircumstanceswasunobtainable.I wanted to see a rule that would make Itin order for the House to pass its willana use its discretion as to whether thisguaranteed income phase of the bill should remain therein or be stricken out.Unfortunately, under the precedents ofthis House in the matter of closed versusopen rules, plus the activities of theleadership on both sides of the aisle, aswell as the able chairman of the Waysand Means Committee, and his oppositemember, the ranking minority member,my efforts proved fruitless.I have always maintained since I havehad the privilege of being a member ofthe Rules Committee that the Membersof this body are as capable of legislatingas the Members on the north wing ofthis Capitol who legislate in a free atmos-phere and without gag rules. Unfortu-nately, the efforts of those who share myviews in this parliamentary procedurewere unable to overcome this combinedopposition to which I have just referredand, as this bill is being considered un-der a closed rule which not only deniesan amendment that would strike thisprovision but denies any and all otheramendments that any of the electedMembers of this House might desire tooffer other than amendments from theWays and Means Committee. I think itis important here to note that the voteon the adoption of the rule, in spite ofthe fact that no organized effort wasmade against it, was very close\u2014204 forand 183 agaInst. Certainly this is indica-tive of the feeling of the membershipof this House on this type of a gag rule.Again, are we in the House admittingthat we are not as capable of legislatingas the Members of the other House, theSenate? In fact, are we not Implying thatwe are second-class legislators?I used my best efforts to try to bringyou out a rule here that would make inorder the consideration of a bill thatwould give you all of the benefits thatare in this bill, but would strike out thisimpractical provision that you have herewhich is the beginning, if not the end, ofa guaranteed income for all of our citi-zens.But who am I, when arraigned againstthe powers that be, the leadership onboth sides, not to mention the persuasive-ness of the able gentleman from Arkan-sas and the able gentleman from Wis-consin, so we failed.And itis interesting to note that amajority of the Committee on Rulesvoted against this rule yesterday on thefloor. I impugn the motives of no oneAnd I say, looking back, had I knownthat the House was as cognizant of whatwas involved in this bill yesterday, as Ithink I know now, we might have de-feated this rule.So what are we left here with? Underthis closed rule whereby we indicate thatwe are second-class legislators, that weare not capable of legislating, we aresecond-class to the other body which canlegislate in a free atmosphere. We areleft now with two options, the optionthat the minority has over here to re-commit and the option to defeat thebill on final passage.Mr. DINGELL. The time of the gentle-man has again expired.Mr. MILLS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2additional gentlemanfrom Mississippi.Mr. COLMER. Mr. Chairman, again Ithank the gentleman.So we are left with these options.Now, I understand that a motion willbe made by the minority\u2014and the pow-ers that be of course on the minority sidewill see that the most advantageous mo-tion to recommit from their viewpointwill be made. I am assuming, rather thanrunning the risk of permitting somebodyover here on this side of the aisle tooffer a motion to recommit with instruc-tions, that they will exercise their prero-gative which, under the Rules of theHouse, the minority justly has.So you will have an opportunity, then,to recommit the bill which frankly, Ithink, would be better than just voting itdown. Let it go back to this distinguishedCommittee on Ways and Means and havethem give further consideration to it andcome up with something that would bemore palatable to get us out of the ad-mitted mess that we are in in this wel-fare program.Now, Mr. Chairman, I cannot imposeupon the few faithful here, and uponmy gracious friend. But just let me windup where I,started.I am worried\u2014I am concerned aboutthe future of this Republic and the f U-tureof the enterprise system that we en-joy, the liberties that we enjoy, and theirperpetuation for future generations.I wonder how many of you recall theletter that Lord McCauley wrote to hisfriend Henry S. Randall some 113 yearsago In which he said that he had studiedour American system of government andhe was sorry to say that it could not pre-vail; that it was all sail and no anchor; April 16,1970thatthe day would come\u2014and this is insubstance what he said and not a ver-batim quote\u2014that the day would comewhen the demands of the people upontheir elected Representatives would be sogreat that they could not be met and thewhole American dream would collapse.Mr. Chairman, I think this bill shouldbe recommitted.Mr. CONABLE. Mr. Chairman, I yield5 minutes to the gentleman from In-diana (Mr. DENNIS).Mr. DENNIS. Mr. Chairman, I am un-der no illusion that anything I say heretoday is likely to sway the course or toaffect the result of this debate; nor doI claim any expertise in the welfare field;but this is a landmark piece ef legisla-tion. I have to vote upon it, and I feelimpelled to say a few words which ex-press my feelings and my doubts andreservations on this matter, and whichset forth my point of view.This is a bill for welfare reform whichcommences by more than doubling thenumber of persons on the welfare rolls;certainly a somewhat anomalous situa-tion. The argument is that, in the end,the number on these rolls will be de-creased, by reason of the incentives builtinto the measure, which are designed toencourage recipients to become employedand to support themselves.Whether this will in fact prove to bethe case has to remain, in the nature ofthings, within the realm of speculation;while the immediate increase in numberof recipients, in dollar costs, and in thenecessity of taxation to meet these costs,is a palpable and present tact.At this point two queries at least crossmy mind: Why do we not make furtherefforts than we Yet have at the use ofincentives for self-removal from welfareprograms In respect to those already onthe welfare rolls, before we add millionsto their number? And why do we notundertake and, for some reasonable andsignificant number of years, observe,evaluate, and, where we can, improve, atrue pilot program in one or two locali-ties, before we undertake this sweepingand costly experiment on a nationalbasis?All are agreed, I think, that the heartof the matter, the justification for thislegislation, is the so-callea workfare pro-visions of the bill. It is these frovisionswhich are designed to encourage and tobring about voluntary self-removal fromthe welfare rolls; and it Is one the ef-fectiveness of these provisions, in prac-tice, that the claimed virtues of this leg-islation must depend.These workfare provisions, in turn,have two aspects. One is the work re-quirement; the other is the work incen-tive. A basic query here Is, how efficientand how effective are this work require-ment and this work incentive likely tobe?The work requirement Is, basically,that, in order to qualify for the familyassistance payment, a man must registerand must accept, if it is available, suit-able employment in which he is able toengage. If he refuses, without good cause,to accept such employment his assistancepayment is forfeited\u2014and, under the billas drawn, this amount.s to a loss of $300per year. Aside from the fact that theCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014HOUSEpenalty hardly seems to be a very largeone, I think that I can foresee all kindsof trouble with the word \"suitable\"\u2014par-ticularly when it is further statutorilydefined, in part, as it is, by reference toa man's past training and experience. Iraise the question why the wor.d \"suit-able\"\u2014at least as presently defined\u2014should be retained in this legislation, ifthere is truly a desire to provide a strongwork requirement. I do not believe thatit is too much to require\u2014or that it ishardhearted or reactionary to require\u2014that, if an able-bodied man is to be sub-sidized by the American taxpayer, heshQuld be required, as a condition prece-dent to receiving that subsidization, toaccept any employment in which he isphysically able to engage\u2014and, if theword \"suitable\" is to be retained, that itshould be defined as meaning and includ-ing any type of employment in which therecipient is, physically, reasonably ableto engage. To do less, it seems to me,emasculates this work requirement pro-vision.The work Incentive provision in thisbill is, basically, that a welfare recipientshall be able to keep for himself halfof what he earns; that is, that his wel-fare benefits shall be reduced by only50 cents for each $1 he earns for him-self. However, as was brought out in mycolloquy with the gentleman from Wis-consin (Mr. BYRNES) 'yesterday, whenall factors are considered, such as the ef-fect on food stamp eligibility of the pro-visions of this legislation and other fac-tors, the actual percentage of earningswhich a recipient Is able to keep withouta decrease of his benefits is, in manycases, not 50 percent but more like 40or 30 percent or below; or, putting it inmore technical language, the so-calledmarginal tax rate goes up to 60 and 70percent, or more. Thus the incentivewhich we hear about is, in tact in thislegislation, substantially watered downand decreased.When one considers, in addition, thatmany of those on welfare are minorchildren, the aged, and the ill, and thatmany others are the mothers of pre-school children to whom the work-fareprovisions and requirenfents do not ap-ply, one cannot but wonder how effectivethese Incentive-to-work provisions canprove to be In practice.Again I say that we start out by morethan doubling the welfare rolls, whilethe efficacy of the provisions relied on to,in time, offset this fact are certainly sub-ject to debate and doubt.The social implications of public sub-sidy to the working poor\u2014including sta-tutorily defined 'poverty\" and wide-spread use of public day-care centers forthe rearing of children, and other fac-tors\u2014whlch I have not attempted to dis-cuss\u2014are also clearly open to very seri-ous question.It has been said that our present wel-fare system is a mess. It has also beensaid that, up to date, no satisfactoryalternative for the plan proposed inHR. 16311 has been suggested.All this may be so, but these arescarcely arguments for the adoption, atthis time, of this particular measure re-gardless of Its own merits or its lackH 3165thereof. The real question before us iswhether this bill will do the job,lATe may well, indeed, need to pause, to wait, to study the problem, and toseek further.What we do know is that, with theadoption of this bill, we place millionsmore of our fellow Americans on thepublic dole; and, say what you will, weguarantee these Americans a stipendfrom the Public Treasury. What we em-phatically do not know Is how,or whether, we will ever get them off thedole again; or how, or to what extent,this bill will operate to do so.I fear we may well wind up with a badsituation merely magnified.I believe that we may well be dashingoff too hastily down a road which leadswe know not where; and along which itmay prove difficult or impossible ever toreturn, should the need arise.Mr. MILLS. Mr. Chairman, I yieldsuch time as he may consume to thegentlemab from North Carolina (Mr.TAYLOR).Mr. TAYLOR. Mr. Chairman, we allrecognize the need for reform in welfarelegislation. The work-training provisionsof the bill are proper and have my sup-port. But why not apply these work-training regulations to the 10 mIllionpeople already on welfare rolls and seehow successful we are in removing themfrom welfare rolls to payrolls as the firststep. If the work-training programs op-erate successfully with these people, wecould then consider bringing additionalmillions under a welfare program whichis working effectively. The welfare struc-ture needs housecleaning and tighten-ing, but not expanding.My objection to this billis that Itclearly puts cash payments from theGovernment first. It consigns some 15million additional Americali citizens towelfare handouts. It would increase thecost of welfare for the first year by about$4.5 billion and probably cost $14 or $15billion per year in a few years.When we pass this law, we. are goingdo*n the road of no return by guaran-teeing a minimum income to people whoare employed and people who are not em-ployed. With each session of Congress,the demands will be for more and more.The tendency of welfare rolls is to goup\u2014never down. When we adopt thisbill, we- will more than double the num-ber receiving welfar'e checks from thGovernment. This will probably prove tbe the most inflationary legislation con-sidered since I became a Member of Con-gress.Government spending is a question ofpriorities. Today, the Nixon admiistra-tion is reducing the money to operateveterans hospitals, providing fewer Hill-Burton funds for badly needed local andregional hospitals, has recommended nomoney for the agricultural conservationprogram, has not provided enough fundsto open the national forest campgroundsthis spring as In the past, has approvedless money than Congress recommendedfor education; yet it recommends thiscostlyguaranteedincomeprogram which, in my opinion, should have a lowerpriority for Federal spending than anyof the items mentioned above. 113166At present, welfare recinients receiveguidance from a trained counselor. Manypeople need this guidance as much asthey need money, but under this pro-posal In many cases the guidance wouldbe gone and checks would Just be mailedout from Washington.This bill would encourage large fam-ilies to be supported at public expenseat a time when we need to work towardpopulation control and family planning.I favor working toward guaranteedemployment, rather than a guaranteedincome. The best way to end poverty Isto go all out in providing all workerswith needed skills and provide enoughgood Jobs to go around. I cannot help butbelieve that welfare payments in manycases stifle the initiative and the prideof the recipients and perpetuate theirpoverty by destroyingtheir. get-up-and-go and their ambition.We all favor providing adequately forthe disabled and for those who are un-able to provide for themselves, but forable-bodied people, I favor a route whichencourages training and employment.We are telling a. workingman who Isnow supporting himself and his familywith pride, that he Is In poverty, thatthe Government Is going to support hisfamily and guarantee him a minimumfamily income. Such would destroy hisself-respect and Initiative. To obtain trueeconomic independence, the initiativeand the pride of the poor must not bestifled. Changing the name of a pro-gram does not change the fact that It Isunwise to encourage our citizens to de-pend upon the Government for the sup-port of their familIes.(Mr. TAYLOR asked and was givenpermission to revise and extend his re-marks.)Mr. MILLS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 4minutes to the gentleman from NewYork (Mr. RYAN).(Mr. RYAN asked and was given per-mission to revise and extend hIs re-.marks.)Mr. RYAN. Mr. Chairman, incomemaintenance is an Idea whose time hascome. Two years ago when I introducedIn the Congress the first bill to providefor a guaranteed annual Income, the ideawas accepted In academic circles and bytheorists, but It was dismissed by so-called pragmatlsts as politically Imprac-tical. Today the Idea. Is respectable, andIthinktheadministrationdeserves credit for making It respectable. TodayIt Is endorsed by both political parties onthe floor of this House through the actionof the distinguished chairman of theCommittee on Ways and Means (Mr.MILLS) and the distinguished rankingminority metnber of the committee (Mr.BYRNES) in reporting oUt H.R. 16311\u2014the Family Assistance Act of 1970\u2014which establishes a guaranteed annualincome for at least a portion of the peo-ple In this country who desperately anddeservedly need this income, and who arelooking to us to responsibly - meetthatneed.I believe the Ways and Means Com-mittee end all the members who sup-ported this In the committee deservecredit for bringing It to the floor andmaking it possible for the Congress toface up to the failure of the present wel-CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEfare system and to begin to lay thegroundwork for an adequate guaranteedannual income.Despite the efforts of the Ways andMeans Committee, I believe there are anumber of deficiencies in this billto which I would like to address myself. Iregret thatbecause of the parliamentarysituation, there is not an opportunity tooffer amendments to improve this bifi.I testified on April 14 before the RulesCommittee in favor of a rule whichwould make It possible to offer specificamendments to improve because it canbe decidedly improved, although It is astep in the right direction, a first step,but one which It is essential this Con-gress take. -Letus recognize to begin with that aguaranteed annual income is not a prlv-.ilege. It should be a right to which everyAmerican is entitled. No country as afflu-ent as ours can allow any citizen or hisfamily not to have an adequate diet, notto have adequate housing, not to haveadequate health services and not to haveadequateeducationalopportunity\u2014inshort, not to be able to have a life withdignity.While there may be differences as tothe mechanics of implementing an in-come maintenance system, there shouldbe no dispute as to Its need. There canbe no dispute that. poverty In the midstof this affluent country is Insufferableand unconscionable.Certainly, an Improvement over boththe administration bill and the bill re-ported out of the Waysand MeansCommittee would be the Income Main-tenance Act which I first introduced inthe 90th Congress, and which I reintro-duced In revised form In the 91st Con-gress as HR. 14773. It Is this bill onwhich I testified before the Ways andMeans Committee last November 13. Gb-vlousW, H.R. 14773 was not adopted bythe Ways and Means Committee.Accepting the concept of Income main-tenance, and establishing the mechanicsfor Implementing that concept are twofar different things. We do well to em-brace the concept; but at the same timewe are being prgsented with a plan for its Implementation which is seriouslyflawed. It Is these flaws which I want toaddress, so that they will be clearly per-ceived, and so that we will be clear asto what improvements must be madeafter this bill is passed.Let us look at some of the areas whereH.R. 16311 Is deficient. Some of the de-ficiencies were In the original adminis-tration bill (H.R. 14173). Some are new.First, I think it is essential that thebenefit levels provided for in H.R. 16311be raised. Under this bill, the basic allow-ance payable to a family of four with noother income is $1,600 annually. Thisamount Is totally inadequate. Even giventhe fact that some States will providesupplementary benefits,' there can be noacceptance of a $1,600 level for a familyof four without accepting, as well thatthis would be a failure to provide mean-ingful help to the poor. That this is, infact, the case Is demonstrated by the sta\u2014tistlcs showing that only in 8 States wiltfamilies experience a rise In assistancelevels.April 16,1970While the benefit levels for the aged,blind, and disabled have been improvedby H.R. 16311, the levels for families re-main the same as in the administrationbill, And the figures prepered by the De-partment of Health, Education, and Wel-fare show how few families are ade-quately aided under these benefit levels.1Only 301,000 families will rise above thepoverty line; re-main below It. In additIon, 2,082,000 fam-ilies whose Incomes now. fall between thepoverty line and the low-income line willremain there. Only 77,000 familIes willrise above the Income line. The adminis-tration's estimates further reveal that of9,556,000 children now below the povertyline, 8,416,000 will remain there underthe presently \u00d8roposed benefit levels. Andof the 6,946,000 children whose families'incomes now fall between the povertyline and the low-income line, only 341,000will rise above It; 6,605,000 wIll not.Yet, according to the Bureau of LaborStatistics, It costs a. family of four livingon a lower budget $6,771 a year In NewYork City. Nationally, the National Wel-fare Rights Organization Is calling fora $5,500 level. And according to theGallup poll of January 25, 1970\u2014The average American believes a familyof four needs a minimum of $120 per week($6,240 per year) to make ends meet.In brief, the benefit levels for thefamily assistance plan proposed by H.R.16311 are totally Inadequate. In add!-tion, while the committee Is to be com-mended for raising benefits for the aged,blind and disabled, the increases are notsufficient to provide a decent income.Second, H.R. 16311 should be mod!-fled to cover single adults and childlesscouples. At present, the bill only appliesto families with children. Yet, the needof families, without children, and singleadults, Is no less dire.Third, a higher percentage of the costsfor -state supplementary benefits shouldbe borne by the Federal Government.The Ways and Means Committee billprovides for 30 percent Federal matchingfunds. At the least, the matching pro-vision should be raised to 50 percent andInstead of matching State supplementalpayments only up to the poverty line, thematching provisionshouldapplyto those State payments made in excess ofthe poverty line, as well.What is more, the matching provi-sion should not in any way penalize thepoor. As H.R. 16311 was reported out, itabolished the provision in the adminis-tration proposal permitting disregardof one-half unearned Income. The mon-ey\u2014$600 million\u2014thereby saved was off-set by the added expenditures incurredIn providing for matching Federal funds.The consequence is to tajfe money fromthe poor. While the aIm of alleviatingthe burden borne by the States is com-mendable, it cannot justify denying thepoor.Actually, the solution Is to provide forfullfederalizatIon of Income mainte-nance. Under the present scheme, StatesSelected CharacterIstics of Families ElIg-ble for the Family Assistance Plan: 1971 Pro-Jections, Department of Health, Education,and Welfare, February 2, 1WTO. April iti, 1970whichalready have made the effort tomeet their obligations to their disadvan-taged citizens by providing relatively bet-ter AFDC benefits, such as New York, arepenalized. Their burden is lightened by30 percent Federal matching, but theremaining load of 70 percent is an oner-ous one.It is clear that Federal matching, if itis to really aid those States which mostneed Federal moneys because they aremost responsibly meeting their obliga-tions, must be far greater than the 30percent provided in H.R. 16311.Fourth, the matching provision forState supplementary benefits should beexpanded to apply to those benefits paidto the working poor. Section 453 of H.R.16311 precludes Federal sharing in thecost of these benefits. This limitation isunjustifiable for several reasons. For onething, one of the objectives of the FamilyAssistance Act Is to do away with the dis-tinction between the working and thenonworking poor. This objective stemsfrom the penalization which has beenimposed upon the working poor by virtueof their being ineligible for welfare bene-fits In most States. This bill institution-alizes the distinction, rather than oblit-erating It.In addition, once again those progres-sive States which have implemented wel-fare programs for the working poor\u2014such as New York\u2014even though theyreceived no Federal assistance for suchprograms, are penalized. They still willnot be receiving any Federal funds forthese programs.Fifth, the Federal Government shouldassume 100 percent of the costs of theprograms for the aged, disabled, andblind.Again, as I said earlier, only the Fed-eral Government has the resources to as-sume this burden. The States simply arenot financially able to readily meet thewelfare needs of their citizens. Full fed-eralization, not only of the programs forthe aged, disabled, and blind, but of theentire income maintenance program, Isurgently needed. Provision should bemade for a 3- to 5-year phasing-in tran-sition to this end.6. Sixth, the coercive work require-ment embodied in H.R. 16311 is undesir-able. Philosophically, It is objectionable;forced work Is alien to Individual choiceand freedom. Pragmatically, the fact Isthat there really are very few personswho would work, but who do not. The co-ercive work requirement Is a misguidedapproach to a problem which really liesIn the failure of the economy to provideplaces for these potential workers, andthefailureofgovernment,._.Federa],State, and local\u2014to provide adequatejob training to enable these people todevelop skills which will make them at-tractive to employers.Seventh, the work requirement for moth-ers with school age children is especiallyegregious. Again, this is a philosophically ob-jectionable requirement. No mother shouldbe required to substitute day care custodiansfor her care and love. We certainly would notconceive of requiring that of mothers withadequate incomes, and there can be no justi-fication for penalizing mothers who have themisfortune\u2014a misfortune thrust upon them,not chosen\u2014to suffer inadequate Incomes.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEH.R. 16311 Is even discriminatory as be-tween recipient mothers. Those who havehusband receiving benefits are not requiredto take' suitable employment. Those who havethe misfortune of being without a husbandare subjected to this requirement.Moreover, practicality instructs us thatsuch a provision cannot work; mothers whoobject simply will not comply with thisrequirement that they take suitable employ-ment. Mitchell Ginsberg, administrator ofNew York City's Human Resources Adminis-tration, clearly attested to this fact in hisspeech before the National League of CitiesConference on March 10, 1970.Finally, this coercive work requirementlevied against mothers with school agechildren is unnecessary. Most mothersdo, in fact, seek work, if there are jobsfor them and day care facilities for theiryoungsters. The AprIl, 1970 issue of Na-tion's Business, certainly not a noted lib-eral magazine, states in an article en-titled, \"The Great Welfare Debate:\"Survey after survey has shown that mostwelfare mothers prefer to work but have beenthwarted by the welfare bureaucracy, lack oftraining opportunities, lack of day care cen-ters for children and lack of knowledge aboutjob opportunities. (p. 60).ItIsobvious from the deficiencieswhich are incorporated In Ii.R. 16311that passage of this bill\u2014which at leastdoes achieve the commendable end ofmaking a guaranteed annual Income areality\u2014is only the beginning. Many pro-visions will have to be amended; manyimprovements will have to be made.Because of this, I want to briefly de-tail the bill which I Introduced, H.R.14173, the Income Maintenance Act. Byway of preface I would point to what Iconsider three of the most important dif-ferences between It and the Ways andMeans Committee bill. First, the IncomeMaintenance Act provides for signific-antly higher benefits than does H.R.16311\u2014benefits for a family of foul' withno outside Income reach $3,228 by thefifth year. Second, the Income Main-tenance Act Includes within its coveragemarried couples without children, andsingle adults. Third, the act contains nowork requirement,Now, I want to outline more exten-sively various aspects of the IncomeMaintenance Act.First. Eligibility. The Income Mainte-nance Act, H.R.. 14773, provides that allindividuals and families are covered, withthe exception of unmarried children un-der age 18 who are not members of aneligible family. This contrasts with H.R.16311, which limits benefit eligibility un-der the family assistance plan to fam-ilies with children.Second. Benefits. The Income Mainte-nance Act provides for Increasing pay-ments over a period of 4 years. In thefirst year, a family of four with no otherincome would receive an annual benefitamount of $2,004. This breaks down to amonthly rate of $50 for the family headand $39. for each dependent-_which in-cludes the spouse. The maximum familybenefit for families of seven or more per-sons Is $284 monthly, or $3,408 annually.By the fifth year, the maximum levelof benefits would be reached. The bene-fits for a family of four would be $3,228.The maximum family benefit, for fami-H 3167lies of seven or more persons, would be$5,472.An additional factor in this equation iscost of living adjustments. Benefits areadjusted to reflect variations In livingcosts, including regional housing costdifferentials.Third. Reduction of benefits. The In-come Maintenance Act which I Intro-duced provides for a sliding scale of re-duced benefits, so that as outside earnedincome increasesthe percentage de-crease In benefits rises. The purpose is asimple one. If there Is a large reductionIn benefits following upon a compara-tively small amount of earned income,there will be a substantial work disincen-tive..Thus, for the first and second years ofthe act's existence, earned income In anamount equal to one-fourth of the max-imum benefit will cause benefits to be re-duced by an amount equal to 25 percentof that Income. Earned income In excessof one-fourth of the maximum benefitwill cause benefits to be. reduced by 50percent of the Income. For the third yearof the act's existence, and thereafter, thesame25 percent tax, so to speak, willapply. Similarly, the 50 percent reduc-tion will apply, but will be limited toearned Income in excess of one-fourth ofthe maximum benefit but less than 1 /2timesthe maximum benefit. All earnedincome above that will cause benefits tobe reduced by '75 percent of the amountof the Income.In other words, there Is a three-steptax, so to speak\u201425 percent, 50 percent,and 75 percent, applied to different pro-portions of earned Income.The way this works in dollar amountsis detmonstrated by looking at the break-even point: that Is, the point at whichoutside income reduces the income main-tenance benefits to zero. For a four-member family,for example, outsideearned income In the first year of the In-come Maintenance Act amounting to$4,259 would reduce benefits to zero.But the fifth year, when benefit pay-ments reach their maximum, and the 75percent reduction has come into effect, afour-member family would have to haveoutside income of $6,186 before reachingzero benefit payments.Fourth.Coordination with presentwelfare. The assumption of my bill isthat In States which now have higheraverage AFDC benefits than the basebenefits provided by H.R. 14773, the Stateand Federal governments would makeup the difference according to the pres-ent AFDC formula. Therefore, the pres-sent welfare recipient In those Stateswould never be worse off than he Is now.And, of course, where welfare benefits arebelow the standards of H.R. 14773, therecipients would be considerably betteroff.Where the Federal Income mainte-nance benefit Is supplemented, my billprovides for State maintenance of pres-sent effort. The standards of need andthe percentage of need provided are notto be reduced.Fifth. Supplemental State programs.Under the Income Maintenance ActStates may establish supplemental In-come maintenance programs patterned 113168afterthe Federal program. Fifty percentof State expenditures under such a pro-gram would be reimbused by the FederalGovernment. As a condition of such Fed-eral payment, however, eligibility underthe State programs would have to be ex-tended to all persons eligible under theFed.eral program.Sixth. Work requirements. The In-come Maintenance Act has no work re-quirement. Beneficiaries on a voluntarybasis may request referral for participa-tion In .a work incentive program. In-dividuals actually participating in suchprograms would receive an additionalallowance of $30 per month. Obviously,this is one of the chief differences fromthe Ways and Means Committee bill\u2014HR. 16311\u2014which, has a coercive workrequirement, whose objectionable fea-tures I have already detailed.Seventh. Assets. As for treatment ofassets, under HR. 14773, the IncomeMaintenance Act, there is no limitationon the amount of assets a family canown. While income would be imputed to each family on the basis of Its assets, ata rate of 5 percent of their value, no In-come would be Imputed on the basis ofthe family's personal effects, tools, home,household goods, or automobile exceptto the extent that the total value of suchassets exceeds $30,000.Eighth. Administration. As for admin-istration, the Income Maintenance Actestablishes a newly created Bureau of In-come Maintenance within the TreasuryDepartment. Investigations\u2014other thanroutine examination of applications\u2014would be limited to no more than 5 per-cent of the number of applicants, ran-domly selected except where there existedprobable cause to doubt eligibility, Ap-peal rights would Include the right to ahearing and also judicial review In caseswhere the results of a hearing were dis-puted. Overpayments could be recoveredby withholding from future benefits or bydirect recovery from the assets of theoverpaid Individual. However, no morethan 50 percent of the overpayment couldbe recouped by recovery from assets nfl-less the overpayment had been obtainedby fraud.I have devoted this time to outliningthe bill which I introduced 2 years ago,not to complain about the fact that therule under which this debate is beingconducted precludes my offering an amendment so that the House may con-sider its merits, but because I believeH.R. 16311 to be deficient In many re-spects, and I want to make clear thatalternatives and improvements are pos-sible.Those who reject the concept of aguaranteed annual income will certainlyfind no merit in either the bill I intro-duced, the administration bill, or in thebill reported out of the Ways and MeansCommittee. But to those who Intend tosupport H.R. 16311, I urge diligent con-sideration of the improvements whichmust be made.By accepting the concept of incomemaintenance,theadministration hasdefined poverty and welfare as nationalproblems which require national solu-tions. The Federal Government shouldmove as rapidly as possible to assume thefull costs of public assistance through anCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEincome maintenance program with anadequate level of benefits.'Of course\u2014and this must be clearlyunderstood\u2014income maintenance is notthe final answer. We must deploy amulti-faceted strategy to break the cyclef poverty. That strategy must includejob creation and training; it must in-elude expanded programs in education,health, and social services. Above all,this strategy to defeat poverty must bebased on a firm, unremitting commit-ment to assure every American a life ofdignity.The CHAIRMAN. The Chair advisesthe Committee that the time remainingto the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.BYRNE5)is 32 mInutes, and the timeremaining to the gentleman from Arkan-sas (Mr. MILt) Is 24 minutes.Mr. MIT.3. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2minutet\u00f6the gentleman from New York(Mr. BINGHAM).Mr. BINGHAM. Mr. Chairman, it hasbeen clear for some time that this Na-tion's appro\u00e3h to the task of providinga living income for all Americans who cannot reasonably be expected to earnone on their own has been in trouble.Both the recipients of Income assist-ance, and the taxpayers who pay thebill, have grown deeply dissatisfied. It is,therefore, most encouraging tbzt theHouse finally has before it legislationthat offers a major overhaul of our en-tire welfare system. This may well be themost important bill to come before the91st Congress.I was among the first Members of Con-gress to introduce legislation to providea living income for all Americans. TheNational Living Income Act, which I in-troduced last August along with Mr. CON-YER5, Mr. WHALEN, and Mr. RYAN, wasdesigned to solve the glaring weaknessesin our current welfare system whichmany of us In Congress, and citizensacross the country, have long criticized.It was designed to improve bot.h the ade-quacy of the income provided to the poor,and the conditions under which assist-ance Is made .avallable. It raised theminimum income for a family of fourto $3,200. It greatly increased the Federalcontribution for welfare, which has be-come such an impossible financial bur-den for areas like New York City wheremore is now spent on welfare than oneducation.It would have establIshedmore uniform national welfare stand-ards making the program more equitablefor recipients and removing the temp-tation for the poor to migrate to alreadyovercrowded urban areas in the North.The welfare reform program originallyproposed by the President offered manyof the same iprovements proposed in thenational living income program, Includ-ing the concept of assistance for theworking poor, but fell short on others.It excluded, for example, the childlesspoor, and it proposed work requirementsthat have already proved Impossible toenforce and questionable In value. Itfailed to make provision for regionalvariation in benefits to reflect regionalcost-of-living differences, and the basicbenefitswere most inadequate\u2014only$1,600 minimum for.a family of four.The modified version of the President'splan reported out by the Ways andApril 16,1970Means Committee and now before theHouse would effect many of the changesin the welfare system I have long urgedand which were essential ingredients ofthe National Living Income Act. In manyrespects, it is a great improvement overthe President's proposal, for which Iwant to commend and thank the distin-guished and very able chairman of theWays and Means Committee, as well asthe members of that committee. On thewhole, this legislation offers a consider-able improvement ,overexistingap- preaches to income assistance, and Iurge my colleagues to vote for it.However, Mr. Chairman, we cannotafford to make the mistake of deludingourselves by thinking that thisbillmakes all the improvements in our wel-fare programs that need to be made. Onthe contrary It contains many of theweaknessescontainedInPresident Nixon's program. For example, the so-called family assistance program ig-nores the childless poor\u2014giving dis-advantaged young couples an incentiveto have children to qualify for welfarewhen they cannot afford children\u2014andthis at a time when we cught to be do-ing everything we can to hold down ourpopulation.Most importantly, however, the in-come level assured by this legislation Is far from adequate. It will assure in-creased benefits in only eight States, andonly a fraction of the families who qual-Ify for assistance will be raised abovethe poverty level. Adding the $864 worthof food which a welfare family of fourcould receive, along with the minimum$1,600 In income which this bill provides,means that a family of four is assuredof only $2,464 under this legislation\u2014not including the States' contributions.But the Federal Government's povertylevel for a family of four Is currentlyset at $3,720\u2014an average figure thatdoes not account for the higher costs-of-living in urban areas. The low budgetneedd by a family of four living In anurban area, as determined by the Bureauof Labor Statistics, is $5,500.A guarantee of $5,500 for a family offour as a goal for our welfare programsIs viewed in many quarters as unrealis-tic\u2014a radical demand not to be takenseriously. In my judgment, such a viewis a tragically mistaken one. Not onlyhave a number of welfare groups, includ-ing most prominently the National Wel-fare Rights Organization, made a strongcase for a $5,500 basic welfare benefit,but such a large and representative dis-tinguished group as the White HouseConference on Food,Nutrition,and Health, called together by the WhiteHouse to advise the President on prob-lems of hunger and poverty in America,adopted a final action resolution callingfor a $5,500 annual income floor.Mr. Chairman, so that the Membersof the House may be reminded of thespecific recommendations of the WhiteHouse Conference on' Food, Nutrition,and Health with regard to income levelsin relation to this legislation, I haveearlier asked unanimous consent to In-clude the \"Task Force Action State-ment\" adopted by the Conference in theREcoRD following my remarks. April 16,1970Thisbill comes before us under a closedrule, with no amendments permitted.This isa procedure which I deplore.How can the poor people of this coun-try be expected to understand that Mem-bers of this House have no chance tovote for example, for an increase in thebenefits provided?I was opposed to the form of the reso-lution\u2014or rule\u2014bringing the bill beforeus and would have supported amend-ments to permit the bill to be openedup for amendment. But by vote of theHouse in closing off debate on the rule,no amendments to it could be consideredeither. Mr. Chairman, these practicesare seen by the general public as undem-ocratic; they demean the House. It istime they were changed, It is time theMembers of the House were treated as intelligentadults,capableofvoting amendments to a bill up or down on themerits, Instead of being told they mustaccept or reject the bill exactly as It emerged from committee,I hope that the needed improvementsIn the bill, Including a major increasein the minimum income, will be made In the Senate and that the House confereeswill look favorably on such amendments.I know that many of my colleagues sharethese sentiments.TASK FORCE ACTION STATEMENTINTRODUCTIONIn opening the White House Conferenceon Food, Nutrition and Health, PresidentNixon said: \"This meeting sets the seal of urgency on the national commitment to putan end to hunger and malnutrition clue topoverty in America.\" We Who have come hereare already firmly dedicated to that goal.The President said: \"Our job is to get re- sources to people in need, and then to letthem run their own lives,\" He did not pro- vide any new or meaningful program by which this can be accomplished. Obviously,he wanted us to do this, and Intended that we should do so. To paraphrase the Presidentwe \"not only accept the responsibility (we)claimtheresponsibility.\"Therefore,the combined task forces on Voluntary Action byWomen, Consumers, Religious Organizations,Community Organizations, Health Organiza-tions, Faculty and Students, and OrganizedLabor,1 present the following action priority program:I. A national emergency: There is a hunger and malnutrition- emergency in this countrytoday. Therefore the President must immedi-ately declare that a national hunger emer- gencyexists, and under existing author-ity must now free funds and implement pro- grams to feed all hungry Americans thisWinter,II. Guaranteeci adequate income: The over- riding remedy for hunger and malnutrition is a minimum guaranteed adequate cash in-come with a floor or $5500 annually (for a family of four). The government must also guarantee a meaningful job with a living wage to those Who can work, elevation ofwages and benefits to those presently under-employed, the \"adequate income\" to thoseunable to Work or find employment, and maximization of the purchasing power ofthe food dollar for all.III.Interim food programs: As interimThe AFL\u2014CIO endorsed the policy state- Inent in principle with no Opposition on cer- tain specifics. The Alliance for Labor Action (ALA), including the United Auto Workers, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters,and th International Chemical Workers Union, endorses this statement as written.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014HOUSEmeasures only, present food programs mustbe reformed and expanded immediately inorder to assure truly adequate benefits andparticipation by all who need them in allparts of the country.IV. Universal school food programs: A na-tionalfree lunch and breakfast programmust be made immediately available to allchildren, through secondary school and re-gardless of income, that will provide at least2/3ofthe minimal requirements of the Rec-ommended Dietary Allowance, while respect-ing cultural food preferences.V. Running the programs: All administra-tive responsIbilities for all hunger relief andnutrition programs must be shifted from theU.S. Dept. of Agriculture to the U.S. Dept. ofHealto, Education and Welfare, with corre-sponding shifts in Congressional committeeresponsibilities. The recipients of these pro-grams must h-ave responsibility for local ad-min1stration of the programs under stand-ards determined at the Federal level.To put these priorities into action requiresthe following:This nation today faces a national hungerand malnutrition emergency. This emer-gency situation requires emergency action.While we initiate long-term programs to.liminate hunger In America, action must betaken immediately to deliver food now tothe millions of Americans whose chronicmalnutrition the nation can no longer tol-erate. Only within the context of adequatefood now can a program of nutrition educa-tion for all Americans have meaning,We therefore call on the President to adoptimmediately the following emergency pro-gram to feed hungry people this winter:(a) Invoke Section 11 of the Disaster Re-lief Act of 1969 and like statutes in orderto supply free food stamps to meet the needsof hungry people.(b) Instruct the Secretary of Agriculturetoimmediatelyrevisefood stamp priceschedules of less than $100 per month (basedon a family of four) 'and at a maximum costof 20% of income.(c) Instruct tho United States Depart-ment of Agriculture to implement directly afood program in every county and town inthe United States within the next threemonths using all available funds, includingthecustomsreceiptfunds(Section32 funds),(d) Actively support immediate passageand funding of the following essential leg-islation. -1.The Senate-passed Food Stamp ReformBill (S. 2547).2. A School Lunch Program Reform whichconsists of the Talmadge school lunch bill,the McGovern amendments and the iavitsproposals.3. The Economic Opportunity Act, partic-ularly its section on emergency hunger relief(Section 401,Title X), and without theGreen-Quie type state control amendmentswhich will In effect destroy OEO.(e) Instruct the Department of Agricul-ture to immediately require that all schoolsreceiving Federal financial and commodityassistance for their lunch and breakfast pro-grams provide free meals to all childrenwhose families are receiving any type of pub-lic assistance,Because each of these actions is eitheralready authorized or embodied in pendinglegislation, action to meet this emergencycan be taken within the next month.IX. GUARANTEED ADEQUATE INCOMETo implement this number one remedy tohunger and malnutrition, the following pro- gram is imperative:(a) The adequate cash income presentlyat $5500 annually for a family of four setsa floor. It should automatically follow thecost of living as defined by the Low StandardBudget of the Bureau of Labor Statistics.(b) Establishment of government careersH 3169in nutrition a-nd allied health professions, inconnection with other private and publicefforts to solve simultaneously social prob-lems and unemployment problems. Thesesuggestions alone should provide two mil-lion new lobs.(c) Grantstoencourage and supportbroadly based organizations of low incomecitizens in local ownership and operation ofsuch services as food production and dis-tribution.(d) Establishment of housing factories onthe order of the automotive industry to servethe dual function of provision of low-costhousing and the provision of jobs at desira-ble wages. This involves creation of 750,000to 1 halllion new jobs to produce 3\u20144 millionhousing units,(e) -Extension to all working people or theright to bargain collectively for wages, hours,and working conditions, including the rightto strike or boycott when necessary.(f) Extension of unemployment insurancecoverage to working groups presently ex-cluded, such coverage to be on the same.tej' and conditions as provided for otherworkers now covered.(g) Improvement of the scope of SocialSecurity laws with a 50% raise this year, sothat the program provides a reasonable re-turn on investment,(k) Reform of certain pricing, packaging,promotion and other food Industry policiesand practices which add unnecessarily to thecost of food. This cost inflation is unfairto every consumer and particularly disas-trous to the poor. We need:1. Price reduction through mandatory lim-itation of promotional and adverbising ex- penditure and other means suggested in theFood Marketing Commission Report.2. Mandatory price marking and postingwhichfacilitatesandsimplifiesprice comparison.3. Effective inspection and regulation toinsure availability of safe nutritious food atfair prices and Conditions of sale.4. Mandatory processing, packaging, andlabeling requirements to identify and pre-serve nutrient content and assure accurateand hdhest promotion,5. Encouragement ofretaildistribution Which talce special account of theneeds of the poor.(1) Establishment of a national prepaidhealth insurance program and new methodsfor the delivery of health care and extensionof existing health programs to all states. TheMedicaid Bill should be fully implementedby 1971.The task forces feel that it is especiallyimportant to note that many of the aboveprograms can be self-supporting and/or in-come-producing, and none will require appro-priations higher than a fraction of the costof the space program. Together they shouldcreate substantial new tax revenue (4 milUonjobs should produce an average increase of$5 billion a year in taxes), substantial in-crease in income through increased buyingpower, and a saving of $7 billion of fundsmisspent under the present public assistanceprograms.III. INTERIM FAMILY FOOD PROGRAMSNone of the existing family food pro-grams\u2014food stamps, comniodity distribution,emergency food and medical services\u2014pro-vides an adequate diet or permits the partici-pation of all who have need. Major reformsand expansions are necessary to make surethat all people in need have access to anadequa.te diet until an adequate income be-comes a reality.As an interim measure only, the food stampprogram must be altered so that it can be-come the primary vehicle for providing anadequate diet to those in need in all parts ofthe United States and its territories, and onIndian reservations. Free food stamps to thosewhose income is less than $100 a month (for H 3170a family of four), modification of the priceschedule so that no recipient must pay morethan 20% of his income for food stamps, na-tional eligibillty standards, self-certification,a coupon issuance to all recipients equal tothe Low Cost Food Plan of the Department ofAgriculture, a several-food expansion of theprogram\u2014all are necetsary to make the foodstamp programs adequate. The commoditydistribution program should no longer serveas a means of surplus disposal but shouldprovide direct food aid adequate to a nutri-tious diet wherever necessary, fully respectingthe ethnic and cultural preference of the re-cipients, Hunger programs of the Office ofEconomic Opportunity should also be ex-panded to supplement the above.We must do the following:(a) The President should support, and theHouse quickly approve, the Senate-passedfood stamp bill. The program should be fullyfunded and fully implemented in all partsof the United States and its territories, In-cluding Indian reservations, before the endof this fiscal year.(b)TheEconomicOpportunity. ActAmendments of 1969, particularly the newsection on emergency hunger relief (Title 4,Section 401\u2014Title X), should be quickly ap-proved and fully funded by the Congress.without crippling amendments subjectingpart or all of the programs to state and localgovernment control.(c) The Federal Government should im-mediately Initiate food programs in the 321counties still without them.xv. UNiVERSALSCHOOLFOOD PROGRAMThere must be established a national childfeeding program which will make availableat least2/3of the Recommended DietaryAllowance. This is to be accomplished byimplementing a free lunch and breakfastprogram for all pre-school elementary andsecondary school children.To assure maximum participation in theprogram, the following steps should be taken:(a) Nutritious food selected shall be con-sistent with the cultural preferences of thechildren to be fed.(b) Funds shall be provided to enableschools, child care centers, and other par-ticipating groups lacking adequate facilitiesfor food preparation, to obtain such facili-ties or to devise ways to provide meals byother means.(c) Community groups shall be eligible tooperate child feeding programs.(d) Local poor residents must be trainedfor careers in nutritional planning and foodpreparation for employment in the program.(e) Food provided at the schools shall beavailable at the choice of the children andtheir parents.v. RUNNING THE PROGRAMSThere is a conflict of interest establishedin the U.S. Department of Agriculture in itsdual role\u2014primarily the advocate for theproducers of food, and secondarily the dis-tributor of food to the needy. Therefore, allprograms' 'relating to the provision of food,food services, food stamps, commodity distri-bution and nutrition services should be re-moved from the administrative jurisdictionof the U.S. Department of Agriculture and beestablished In the Department of Health,Education and Welfare, whose primary con-cerns are the needs and well-being of thepeople these programs were created to assist.Within that department, the provisions offoou services of all kinds should be tied asclosely as possible to the provision of overallcomprehensive health care. We call on thePresident to use his Executive authority toinitiate these changes.To provide maximum coordination, Con-gressional responsibilities for both fundingand programming should be reassigned tocoincidewiththeaboveadministrativechanges.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014 HOUSEThe provisions of food services has Wv oftenbeen thwarted by lack of responsiveness atthe state and local governmental levels. Thepoor should run their own programs. Max.i-mum dignified participation by recipients Isinsured by transferring organizational andoperational responsibil ties to duly consti-tuted, broad based, ba I community organi-zations of the recipients themselves. Certi-fication, review and auditing must be doneentirely at the Federal level to circumventparochial political implications and to in-sure the protection of individual rights ofthose presently living In hunger and despair.From all corners of this nation we havecome together out of a deep concern to endhunger in America now. We feel a heavysense of obligation to follow through on ourcommitment and on the commitments of thisConference. We brought with us the diversitythat is the American people and we believethere is need for on-going active participa-tion of all people in Implementing the recom-mendations of this Conference.Therefore, we call upon the organizers ofthis Conference to provide an effective con-tinuing mechanism by which all of us whohave this concern can 'contribute vigorouscontinuing leadership to ensure that thisConference produces action. Today Is a begin-ning, not an end, of our commitment to endhunger In America.And the appropriate beginning is confer-ence-wide adoption of the 5 poInts:1. A National Emergency.2. Guaranteed Adequate Income.3. InterIm Food Programs.4. Universal School Food Program.5. Running the Programs.Mr. SCHEUER. Mr. Chairman, I amimpressed with the Important questionsraised by my two colleagues from NewYork (Mr. BINGRAM and Mr. RyAr) andearlier today by my colleague fromPennsylvania(Mr. DENT). Importantsubstantiveissueshave beenraised pointing out directions in which the billshould be clarified or improved. I re-gret,\u2014alongwith manyof my col-leagues\u2014that this bill\u2014excellent as itis, and credit as itIs to the distin-guished Ways and Means Committee\u2014came to the floor under a closed rule\u2014and,therefore,cannoteffectivelybe clarified or improved on the floor. IIntend to vote aye on a motion to re-commit so that the ambiguities and liii-perfections can be cured and the billreturned to the floor in improved form.Ifthe motionto recommitfailsI shall, of course, vote for the bill, for,with its shortcomings, it is neverthelessa great step forward in comprehensivewelfare reform.I know many of my colleagues Join mein the hope and intent that the Senatewill act on some of the testimony and.other expert opinion on the bill\u2014ex-pressed during the months of hearings\u2014and willclarifyor improve thebill where the need has been established,and that the House conferees will ap-proach such clarifications or improve-ments inaconstructive and open-minded fashion.Mr. CONABLE. Mr. Chairman, to the from Ohio(Mr. WHALEN).(Mr. WHALEN asked and was givenpermission torevise and Chairman, I rise insupport of H.R. 16311.April 16, 1970During the past 200 years the ynitedStates has developed the greatest stand-ard of living the world has ever seen.Despite-this fact there are today 25 mil-lion Americans who do not enjoy thefruits of this great standard of living.How toassistthese less-fortunateAmericans represents one of the greatdomestic issues confronting our countrytoday.The Social Security Administration hasdeveloped what it calls a poverty index.According to this index, in 1959, 22 per-cent of all Americans lived below thepoverty income line. Due to the greatproductivity of our economic system, by1968 this figure had been reduced to 13percent of all Americans. Despite thisgreat improvement there are still twovery disturbing factors that are presentin these statistics. First, while the statis-tics indicate that approximately 3 mil-lion nonwhite Americans got out of thepoverty bracket, nevertheless, today 34percent' of all nonwhite Americans livein what we call the poverty category,according to the social security povertyindex.Second, in the 9-year period between1959 and 1968 there has been absolutelyno change in the number of AmericansWho are members of families headed byfemales.It is these two groups and combina-tion of groups that represent what wemight call our hard-core poor. It is tothese two groups that our welfare pro-grams at the Federal, State, and locallevels have been directed.We have heard from previous speakersthat these programs have simply notworked. The costs have mushroomed.Yet the hard-core poor have not beendislodged. The reasons are many for thefailure of our welfare programs to work.You already have heard a number ofthem mentioned. Let me cite what Iconsider to be the two most important.First, current welfare benefits do notalways go to those who are in need. Letme give you a couple of illustrations. Avery noted economist, Eli Ginsburg men-tioned a couple of years ago that onlyabout 1 out of 10 poor Americans receivany benefit from our Federal povertyprograms. Another well-known econo-mist, Dr. James Tobin, delineated a se-ries of Federal, State, and local welfareand social insurance programs and hemade the comment that less than halfof the poor in America receive any, bene-fits from these programs.Second, our current welfare programsprovide the wrong incentives. For exam-ple, when a person on weJiare accepts apart-time or seasonal Job, his welfarebenefits are reduced by an amount cor-responding to the additional income hereceives.Mr. Chairman, it Is evident, therefore,that our current programs are simplynot working and we must have a new ap-proach. I suggest to you, Mr. Chairmanand members of the committee, we dohave a new approach in the family as-sistance program which we are con-sidering today. This approach, in myopinion, overcomes the weaknesses thatare present in the current Federal, State,and local welfare programs.' April 16, 1970Forexample, the benefits under FAPwill go directly to the needy becausethey will be based upon income. Second,FAP will provide a positive work incen-tive, whereas under present programs wehave negative incentives.I think it was the late President Ken-nedy in his inaugural address in Janu-ary 1961 who repopularized an old Chi-nese proverb:A journey of a thousand miles begins withthe first step.1 think we are taking today a signifi-cant first step if we adopt the familyassistance program.As the previous speaker, the gentle-man from New York (Mr. BINGHAM)Indicated, there are some Members whofeel that there should be broader cover-age and that the benefit level sho4ld begreater than that which is proposed InH.R. 16311.As a matter of fact, I joined the gen-tleman from New York (Mr. BINGHAM)and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.CQNYERS) in presenting such a bill. ButI think at the present time, due to thepresent Federal budget strictures, it isnot very practicable to think in termsof broadening coverage right now.Therefore, I would like to suggest tothose of you who believe as I do thatultimately the program should be broad-ened, that the benefit level should beincreased,that we are today indeedtaking a significant first step. We arechanging direction, we have come upwith an innovative program. It is for thisreason that I Intend to vote affirmativelyfor H.R. 16311 and I would urge mycolleagues to do likewise.Mr. MILLS. Mr. Chairman, I yIeld 2minutes to the gentleman from Califor-nia (Mr. BURToN).(Mr. BURTON of California asked andwas given permission to revise and ex-tend his remarks.)Mr. BURTON of California. Initially,Mr. Chairman, I would like to record mysupport for the pending legislation andmy commendation to the administrationfordemonstratingunderstandingto come forth with this proposal.For those of our colleagues who areconcerned that this proposal is too richfor their blood, I might note that a $1,600annual base for a family of four hardlycompares favorably with the Bureau ofLabor Statistics findings that It takessome $5,500 a yearS for a family of four Inthe major urban areas of the country tolive at some minimal level.I must also state that I think the ad-ministration bill was somewhat prefer-able in the family plan than that whichthe committee reported, and I make spe-cific reference to the fact that in the ad-ministration proposal the unearned in-come was permitted to be disregardedby 50 percent; the committee deleted thisbenefit to the poor which had the effect,lamentably, of taking some $600 millionor $700 million per year out of theirpockets.However, with reference to the adultprogram the Nixon administration pro-vided literally no assistance to the el-derly, the blind, and the dlsabjed In thiscountry. It merely Increased the Federalmatching which wag going to result\u2014es-CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014HOUSEsentially\u2014in savings to the States. In thisregard I think the committee is to behighly commended for their significantchanges in the adult category by providing some minimum assurance of incomefor our aged, blind and disabled people.And, finally, Mr. Chairman, I wouldlike to note this: A number of my col-leagues on the Democratic side of theaisle have privately noted that if the billdoes not work, Republicans are going tohave to take the full blame. Well, I hap-pen to feel that that is just so muchnonsense.I am not sure this bill is going to workperfectly and I do not think the admin-istration has said that. But anyone whoknows anything about this field knowsthat our current program not only doesnot work and the costs of that programare skyrocketing. For those who are goingto oppose this bill, I think the only wayone can interpret that vote is that theyare on record as supporting this currentmess that we have and these skyrocket-ing costs under the current program willbe theirs to defend and not mine. I amgoing to support the legislation.I ask Chairman MILLS, it is my under-standing that under present law and un-der this bill, the food stamp bonus will bedisregarded in figuring the amount ofadult assistance payments. Is that right?Mr. MILLS. Yes.Mr. BURTON of California. Underpresent law and regulations, home pro-duce used by the household for Its ownconsumption is disregarded as income oras a resource for adult public assistancerecipients. This bill would permit this tocontinue, would it not?Mr. MILLS. Yes.Mr. BURTON of California. It is myunderstanding that under the adult as-sistance programs a scholarship of thetype which would be disregarded underthe family assistance provisions of thebill would also be disregarded as part ofthe rehabilitative services disregardedunder the adult provisions, which applyIn particular to the disabled and theblind. Is that right?Mr. MILLS. Yes.Mr. BURTON of California. It is myunderstanding that it is the intention ofthis bill that the authority of the Secre-tary to set the 25-percent Federal match-ing ceiling in the adult categories wouldnot be invoked at a lower level of averagepayment, including full Federal partici-pation, than the highest levels of averagepayment now made by the States undercurrent State programs for the aged,blind, and disabled. Is that your under-standing also?Mr. MILLS. Yes.Mr. BURTON of California. It is myunderstanding that the minimum pay-ment to' adults provided In section 1603(b) shall be in the form of a cash pay-n1ent which when added to an individ-ual's other income, not disregarded un-der other provisions in the bill, will beat least $110 a month. That term wouldnot include any amounts provided formedical care, except, of course, in thecase of an institutionalized person. Isthat right?Mr. MILLS. Yes.Mr. BURTON of California. If a Statechooses Federal administration of the'H 3171adult assistance categories, then the Fed-eral Government would administer theprogram in accordance with require-nients of Federal law whether or not theState plan was in full compliance withFederal law?Mr. MILLS. Yes.Mr. BURTON of California. Mr. Chair-man, enactment of H.R. 16311, the Fam-ily Assistance Act of 1970, Is a soundfirst step in reform of our public assist-ance structure. It provides benefits thatare far below any objective gage of pov-erty and will provide only marginal as-sistance to all too many of our neediestcitizens. Thirty Members of the Househave joined me in signing the followingstatement in support ofsignificantlyhigher income guarantees than thoseprovided in H.R. 16311:We believe all Americans are entitled toan adequate income from wages, welfare, orboth. Surveys by the U.S. Department ofLabor demonstrate that an urban family offour spends $8500 a year merely to live at a low evel with an adequate diet. The GallupPoll of January 25, 1970, says that the averageAmerican believes a family of four needs$120 a week ($6240 a year)to get along. Therefore:1. A real welfare reform must be based on the amount of money that a family needs.The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reg- ularly compiles such data that reflects whatpeople actually must spend to obtain decentfood, clothing, and shelter.We support the implementation of the De-partment of Labor's determination of need.HR. 16311 does not use such an objectivestandard of. need as already determined bygovernment agencies.2. We criticize, as inadequate, the incomelevel in the H.R. 16311 Family AssistancePlan (FAP). At worst, it provides only $7.70 a week for each person in a poor family of 4($1600/yr.); at best, a ceiling of $17.90/wk.per person (3720 FAP ceiling for 4). ThisPoverty Line is based on the Agriculture De- partment's Economy Food Plan which, ac- cording to the Department, \"is not a reason- able measure of basic money needs for a good diet\" and allows a person to survivewith adequate nutrition \"for short emer- gency periods of time and only under veryspecial circumstances.\" Furthermore, thereis no provision in HR. 16311 for automatic cost-of-living increases; yet the latest LaborDepartment statistics show the cost-of-livingis increasing the rate of 6.2% a year.While, as members of the House of Rep-resentatives, most of us intend to vote forHR. 16311 as a sound step toward the elim-ination of poverty, we nevertheless retainthese serious reservations about the Inade-quacy of the Family Assistance Plan.Representatives BURTON of California,BINGHAM, BROWN of California, Cms-HOLM, CLAY, WILSON of California.Mr. Chairman, since the beginning ofthis Congress I have served as the chair-man of the Democratic Study Group'sTask Force on Health and Welfare. Be-fore the Committee on Ways and Meansreported the bill we will vote on today,the task force submitted its recommen-dations both to the committee and tothe Democratic Study Group's member-ship. A number of our recommendatloflshave been Incorporated Into the bill, and H 3172as a result the bill has beer measurablystrengthened. I submit for the RECORDnowthese recommendations so that allMembers may familiarize themselveswith them. We will be working in themonths ahead to further strengthen thebill along the lines the task force hasrecommended so that the final productwill, while remaining within the admin-istration'sfiscalandprogrammaticguidelines, insure that every Federal dol-lar spent contributes to the welfare ofrecipients.In addition I submit for the RECORDthe Democratic Study Group's FactSheet entitled \"Proposed Welfare Re-forms.\" This analysis was coordinatedand developed by our brilliant and hardworking staff member, Rick Merrill. Inmy view this document provides an ex-tremely useful summary of the biU andanalysis of its key provisions and pointsof controversy.The material follows:REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS ON PRESIDENTNIXON'S WELFARE REFORM PROPosALsThe DSG Task Force on Health and Wel-fare herewith submits its report and recom-mendations regarding President Nixon's wel-fare proposals to the DSG membership. Thereport has also been forwarded to all Demo-oratic members of the House Committee onWays and Means and the Senate FinanceCommittee and to appropriate Governmentagencies and offtoial8.The Task Force, at the request of theDSG leadership, has been studying this issuesince last October, when HR. 14173, the Ad-ministration's welfare reform bill, was in-trothiced in the House. The Task Force helda number of meetings and briefings on thesubject. Special separate sessions were heldwith Mr. Ben Heineman, Chairman of Presi-dentJohnson'sCommissiononIncome Maintenance, former IW Secretary WilburCohen, and an Administration briefing teamheaded by PresidentialCounselor DanielMoynihan and HEW Under Secretary JohnVeneman.The Nixon welfare proposals contain anumber of commendable initiatives. partlc-jilarly with respect to coverage for all fami-lies with children and Federal participationin setting standards. The Task Force rec-ommends approval of the Nixon Family As-sistance Plan as a sound step toward theelimination of poverty. However the Admin-istration Plan should be strengthened in anumber of key areas, and benefits underadult assistance programs broadened. Spe-cific Task Force recommendations for im-provement of the Nixon proposals follow:TAMILY ASSISTANCE PLAN RECOMMENDATIONS1. Labor standard safeguards contained inthe Nixon Plan should be clarified. Includingdefinitions of wage levels and conditions un-der which job offers will be considered suit-able.2. Any work provisions for mothers shouldfn all instances place the interests of thechild or children first.3. The Nixon Plan should contain a com-mitment to full federalization of family as-sistance, with benefit levels raised to thepoverty level in equal stages within a specifictime period.4. Only net earned income, alter deductingthe expenses of seeking, obtaining, or hold-ing employment\u2014to the extent permitted bycurrent law\u2014should be considered in the re-duction of the family assistance grant.5. Food stamps should be provided auto-matically to all family assistance benefici-aries in amounts for which they are eligible.6. States should be required to meet budg-eted unmet needs in their family assistanceCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEprograms, at the risle of loss of other Fed-eral funds.7. Assurance should be provided that nofamily receives a reduction in its grant (Fed-eral and state) from what it is currentlyreceiving.CNILDLESS PERSONSThe Task Force does not recommend at thistime the inclusion of childless persons, otherthan those eligible for assistance under aged,blind, and disabled programs, until and un-less the unemployment rate reaches 6%.In the event a 6% rate of unemployment isreached, the Task Force recommends that thebenefit level for the then eligible childlesspersons be set at the family assistance rate.AGED, BLIND, AND DISABLED PROGRAMRECOMMENDATIONSThe Task Force recommends approval ofthe Administration proposals, with the fol-lowing additions:1. Increase to $150 per month (from the$90 proposed) the guaranteed Income floorfor the Nation's aged, blind, and disabled.2. Providefor a cost-of-living escalatorclause in the minimum monthly guarantee.3. Reduce the age cligibllity from .the pres-ent 65 year to age 60 for men and age 55for women.4. Increase earnings permited to $100 permonth for the aged and the same amountfor the blind and disabled with an earn-ing incentive to the later two groups of 50%In addition to the $100 disregard.5.' Require the states to fully meet anybudgeted\u2014but unmet\u2014needs of aged, blind,and disabled recipients.6. Assurance should be provided that noindividual receives reduction in his benefit(Federal and state) from what he is cur-rently receiving,7. The provision of current law permittingthe disregard of $7.50 per month of outsideincome should be made mandatory, and thecurrent temporary $4.00 social security dis-regard should be made permanent, with acomparable increase for those not receivingsocial security benefits.8. Food stamps should be provided auto-matically to all aged, blind, and disabledbeneficiaries in amounts for which they areeligible.FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION AND FUNDINGRECOMMENDATIONSThe Task Force recommends that the ad-ministration of programs for the aged, blind.and disabled be assumed by the Federal gov-ernment on January 1, 19'71.Program costs should be entirely borne bythe Federal Government on January 1, 1971,except that:For the calendar year 1972 the states shallpay the full amount they expen4ed for thefiscal year ending June 20, 1970.For the calendar year 1977 the states shallpay fl62/3 % of the amount they expended forthe fiscal year ending June 30, 1970.For the calendar year 1973 the states shallpay 33% of the amount they expended losthe fiscal year ending June 30, 1970.'As of January 1, 1974, the full costs andadministration of programs for the aged,blind, and disabled should be borne by theFederal Government.PROPOSED WELFARE REFORMSThis DSG Fact Sheet deals with H.R. 16311,whichcontainsPresidentNixon'sbasic reoommendations for reform of public as-.sistance programs. The bill establishes anew Family Assistance Plan (FAP) withFederal eligibility standards and benefit pro-visions for families with children. The billalso provides Federal eligibility standardsand minimums for aid 'to the aged, blind,and disabled.The Ways and Means Committee reportedthe bill (H. Rept. 91\u2014904) on March 11 bya vote of 21\u20143. The Rules Committee is cx-April 16, 1970pected to grant a closed rule on Tuesday,April 7. Floor consideration will begin Wed-nesday,April, 8,subject to a rule beinggranted.SECTION ONEBackgroundCurrent public assistance programs com-prise two major components\u2014aid to familieswith dependent children (AFDC), and adultassistance pragrams for the aged, the blind,and the disabled. Both components are ad-ministered by the States or by localities withState supervision, with widely varying eligi-bility standards, benefit levels, and workreferral requirements. For a family of fourAFDC benefits range from an average of$44 per month in Mississippi to $264 permonth In New Jersey. Adult public assist-ance benefits range from an average of $40per month for the aged in Mississippi to $160per month for the blind in California. About1.7 million families containing 6.7 individ-uals jecelve AFDC. Another 3 millIon in-dividuals receive assistance under programsfor the aged, the blind, and the disabled.Concern over public assistance programshas focused primarily on AFDC due to therising rate of families applying for such as-sistance. The last attempt at Federal rgu-lation of AFDC was the 1967 Amendmentsto the Social Security Act, which provided:An AFDC \"freeze,\" never implemented andrepealed in June 1969. on the number ofeligible children in a given state receivingAFDC due to absence of a parent from thehome.Mandatory referral of \"appropriate\" AFDCrecipients for work training projects, withwide latitude for state administrators to de-fine 'appropriate\" under Federal-state guide-ines.Work Incentives providing for exclusion offirst $30 per month earned plus one-thirdof the remainder, after deduction of the expenses of working.AFDC rolls, however, continued to rise anda number of Federal agencies began to svs-tematically analyze the public assistance population. President Johnson appointed aCommission on Income Maintenance Pro-grams which undertook an in-depth studyof'poverty in the United States. Welfare spe-cialists generally began to question tradi-tional assumptions about public assistancebeneficiaries.Mostimportantly,welfare began to be viewed In the overall context ofpoverty in the United States.As a result of these various studies, newinformation about welfare recipients and thepoor generally came to light:Income at the government-defined povertylevel for a family of four allowed about $100per year for Items other than basic neces-sities, such as medical care, furniture, andschool supplies.The food budget for an average welfarefamily was discovered to be $1 per day perperson\u2014too low for a nutritionally adequatediet, according to the Department of Agri-culture.In a total public assistance population ofabout 10 million persons, only 50,000, or 1 In200, were found to be able-bodied employablemales.On the basis of such findings anti mount-ing public pressure from overburdened Stateadministrations, taxpayers, and welfare re-cipients themselves, the Nixon Administra-tion in August of 1969 announced its FamilyAssistance Plan (FAP) for welfare reform.along with recommendations for consolida-tion and a basic Federal minimum_paymentIn the aged, blind, and disabled programs.The President's proposals generallyre- ceived widespread public support. On March11, 1970, after extensive hearings, the Com-mittee on Ways and Means reported H.R.16311 containing the key elements of thePresident'sproposalsforFederalbenefit minimums and eligibility standards for lam- April 16,1.970ilyassistance and for programs for theaged, blind, 16311 Federal participationin AFDCprogramsand Instead establishes aFederal floor of $1600 per year for a family offour with no other income. Work incentiveearned income exclusions permit a family offour to earn up to $3920 before losing theirFederal supplement completely. PAP providesFederal eligibility standards that would In-clude families headed by an unemployedmale in the home and, for the first time,families headed by a full time employedperson.The bill requires States to maintain pro-grams to supplement PAP up to their Janu-ary 1970 level of payment or the povertylevel, whichever is lower. States receive 30%in Federal matching funds for these supple-mentary programs. States would receive noFederal funds for programs to assist theworking poor.The bill provides tight Federal requirementsfor registration and referral for job trainingand employment programs to be developedby the Depat,ment of Labor. Mothers of pre-school children need not register, but thebill requires all others, including the workingpoor, to register for job training. The billauthorizes new job training programs andchild care facilities for these new registrants.For the aged, blind, and disabled, H.R.16311 consolidates existing Federal-State programs and sets Federal eligibilIty standardsand income exclusion provisions. The billprovides a minimum payment of $110 permonth for all aged, blind, and disabled eligi-bles who have no other income.The bill will extend coverage under familyassistance from about 7 million to about 20million persons and extend coverage to adultsunder aged, blind, and disabled programsfrom 3 million to about 4 inhlUon persons.HEW an the Bureau of the Budget estimatethat the bill will add $4.4 BILLION to currentwelfare costs, including $600 million for ex-panded work training and day care programs.Summary of key differences between ad-ministration proposal and H.R. 16311The Committee bill drops the provision inthe Administration proposal permitting dis-regard of unearned income, thereby remov-ing an estimated $600 million in direct Fed-eral assistance to families with children. TheCommittee bill adds an estimated $300 mil-lion in savings to the States In the PAPportion of the hiil and an estimated $100million in aged, blind, and dIsabled benefits.With regard to work registration and train-ing requirements, the Committee bill con-tains the following new features:Protective labor standard safeguards al-though the exact wage level at which bene-ficiaries must take jobs Is not clear.A definition of job \"suitability\" derivedfrom that in use under state unemploymentcompensation laws.A requirement that the working poor reg-ister for job training in addition to thosewithout full time jobs.Increased emphasis on special work proj-ects where employment on the regular econ-omy is not available, and Federal financingarrangements for on-the-job trainingrThe Committee bill also provides full Fed-eral funding for day care programs as op-posed to 90% Federal matching under theAdministration proposal.The Committee bill provides for full Fed-eral assumption of administrative coats wheleStates opt to have the Federal Governmentmake direct payments to beneficiaries in bothPAP and the adult assistance programs. TheAdministration proposal provided for only50% Federal assumption of administrativecosts.In the aged, blind, and disabled adult cate-gories the Committee bill raises the Federalminimum 'to $110 per month from the $90per month In the Administration bill for in-CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEdividuals with no other income. The new Fed-eral minimum combined with the earnedincome exclusions in the Committee bill willadd to the incomes of aged, blind, and dis-abled public assistance recipients and broadencoverage of these programs.SECTION TWO. BASIC PROVISIONS OW HR. 16311Title I. The /amily assistance planFAP Benefits and EligibilityThe bill provides an annual Federal familyassistance benefit of $500 for each of the firsttwo family members and $300 for each ad-ditional family member. The benefit is re-duced by the amount of the family's incomeover and above the followingThe first $720 per year of the total ofearned income of all family members, plusone-half the remainder.Irregularly received amounts of earned andunearned income up to $30 per quarter ofeach type, determined in accordance withcriteria prescribed by HEW.Earnings of a child if in school and thetuition part of scholarships and fellowships.The training allowance for those in train-ing and earnings used to pay for child care.Food stamps and other public or privatecharity, and produce grown and used athome.Families with more than $1500 in resources,other than the home, household goods, per-sonal effects, and property essential to thefamily's self-support would not be eligiblefor the program.A family is defined as two or more peopleliving together, at least one of whom is adependent child under 18 (21 if a full-timestudent). A parent who ,is temporarily ab-sent due to employment or military servicewould be considered living in the place ofresidence. Persons receiving aid to the aged,blind, or disabled are not considered familymembers. Military families would be con-sidered eligible.Each member of a family found eligiblewould be required to register for employ-ment or training with their State employ-ment service, except for the following:Those unable to work bedause of illness,inoapacity, or age, and children under 16 (21if in school).Mothers of children under 6 and mothersin cases where the father registers.Persons caring for an ill member of thehousehold.The bill requires child care for those intraining or employment and vocational re-habilitatton for those unable Ito work due toincapacity, and permits voluntary registra-tion of those exempted. The working poorwould also be required to register.PersonS refusing to regIster or refusingmanpower training or employment withoutgcYod cause would not be taken into account(but their income would be counted) in de-termining the family benefit. In determiningsuitability for employment, a person's fitnesspotential, and prior training and experiencewould be taken into consideration. Individ-usia could not be required 'to take jobs 'ifthe wages, hours, or other terms or considera-tions of the work are contrary to or less thanthose prescribed by Federal, state, or locallaw.\"State Supplementation of PAPStates whose payments under the oldAFDC program are above the PAP level wouldbe required to supplement the PAP benefitup ito that level or to the poverty level,Whichever is lower. The poverty level is de-fined In 'terms adjusted annually toreflect changed living costs. Thirty percentin Federal matching funds would be avail-able for this supplementation. The FederalGovernment would pay 50% of the admin-istrative coSts of State supplementary pro- grams.States would have to supplement the ben-efits of all those currently aligible and allof those newly eligible under the PAP stand-ards, except the working poor. All Stateswould be required to supplement the bene-fits of families where the father is unem- ployed or where a child is between 18 and21 and in School, both now at State opinion.In computing benefits the States wouldbe required to follow the rules for PAP, ex- ceptin the case of the work incentiveearned income exclusion. The complicatednew earned income formula for the Statesupplement,1 when combined with the PAPwork incentive exclusion, would have rough-ly the same impact as the current disregard(all working expenses plus $30 per monthplusone-thirdofearningsabovethis amount.)Administration of PAPThe bill provides three possible admin-istrative arrangements:Federal administration of both the PAPand the State supplementary program, inwhich case the Federal government wouldpay all the administrative costs of bothprograms,State administration of both the FAP andthe State supplementary program.Federal administration of the PAP andState administration of the State supple-mentary program.In the latter two cases the Federal Gov-ernment would pay the costs of admin-istering the PAP and the Federal Govern-ment and the State would equally divide thecosts of administering the State supple-mentary program.The bill also contains a provision underwhich deserting parents w9uld incur an ob-ligation to the Federal GoVernment for theamount of Federal payments to their fam-ilies under PAP. Other \u00d8ovisions authorize$20 million for research and demonstrationprojects to improve PAP and technical as-sistance to the States.Service ProgramsIndividuals registered under PAP would beprovided an \"employability plan\" and erv-ices and training similar to those providedunder the current work incentive (WIN) pro-gram. Existing manpower training programswould be utilized where possible and Statswelfare departments would be required toprovide health care and other services to en-able an individual to participate. Each in-dividual participating in a training programwould receive $30 per month an allowancesto cover 'transportation and other associatedtrainingcosts.The FederalGovernment would pay 90% of the costs of such trainingprograms.The bill authorizes grants up to 100% topublic or private agencies for day care pro-grams for children of manpower training par-ticipants. For school-age children, group orinstitutional care would be provided throughlocal educational agencies whenever possible.Fees for child care could be charged on thebasis of a family's ability to pay.The bill authorizea 90% matchinggrants forservices supporting manpowertraining programs. HEW will make furtherrecommendations for social services in thenear future. ITheStates would have to exclude thefirst $720 per year plus (1) one-third of theremainder up to twice the unreduced FAPbenefit ($3200 for a family of four), plus(2)one-fifth of any earnings above thatamount, 113174TtZe11.\u2014Aid to the aged,blind,anddisabled (AABD)AABD State Plan' RequirementsThe bill would repeal current Federal pro-visions for separate programs for the aged(OAA), blind(AB), and permanent andtotally disabled (APTD) and establiSh a newcombined Federal-State program (AABD)with a monthly benefit minimum of $110 foraged, blind, and disabled persons with noother income. The bill provides for uniformFederal definitions for blindness and dis-ability.Existing Federal admlnistrative require-ments for State plans are retained in thebill, as are regulations designed to protectthe rights of recipients. The bill also specifi-cally excludes State plans which containresidency requirements, an age requirementover 65, or citizenship requirements whichdeny benefits to United States citizens or law-fully admitted aliens continuously in red-dence for 5 years preceding application.AABD ELIGIBILITY ANDINCOMEDISREGARDSIndetermining need for aid under AABDprograms. States are required to exclude thehome, household goods, and personal effectsof an individual, and other resources up to$1500. States must also not impose respon-sibility on relatives unless the beneficiary isthe relative's spouse, or a child who is under21, blind, or disabled.Income disregards are as follows:For the blind and disabled, the first $85 permonth of earned income plus one-hall theremainder, mandatory on the States.For the aged, the first $60 per month ofearned income plus one-half the remainder,optional with the States.$7.50 per month of earned or unearned in-come before disregard of any of the above.optional with the States.The bill also makes permanent a temporaryprovision in the 1969 Social Security Amend-ments requiring the States to pass along toA.ABD recipients a $4 per month social secu-rity disregard.AABDFEDERALMATCHING PROVISIONS ANDADMINISTRATIONThe Federal Government would pay 90%of the first $65 of the average payment madeto AABD beneficaries and one-fourth of theremainder, up to a limit set by HBW. Thebill provides for optional direct payment torecipients by the Federal Government, inwhich case all administrative costs would beborne by the Federal Government.State plans providing certain rehabilita-tive services prescribed by HEW for A.ABDrecipients would qualify for 75% Federalmatching for such services and 60% of theremainder of administrative costs. The Fed-eral Government in any event would pay 50%of administrative costs of A.ABD programs.SECTION THREE. COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OPKEY PROVISIONSPresident Nixon's welfare reform proposalsraise a number of basic issues. Alternativeproposals have come from a number ofsources, including President Johnson's Com-mission on Income Maintenance Programs,Senator Fred Harris, a number . ofprivate organizations, and the Ways and MeansConunittee. Following is an analysis of Ad-ministration, Ways and Means Committee,and alternative proposals in key areas.Benefit levelsThe basic FAP benefit ($1600 per year for afamily of four with no other income) iS rec-ommended in the Committee bill. This basicbenefit is supplemented both in the Admin-istration proposal and the Committee billby exclusion of the value of food stamps($864 for a family of four with the basicFAP Income of $1600). This $2464 total com-pares with thebasicbenefitsof$2487 recommended by the Harris bill and $2,400recommended by the Commission of IncomeCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEMaintenance. The Harris and Commissionbills, however, also provide for automaticescalation to the poverty level in a specificperiod of time. A number of organizationsrecommend a basic benefit at the povertylevel this year, currently set at 3720. The Na-tional Welfare Rights Organization recom-mends $5500, the Lower Standard Budget setby the Bureau of Labor Statistics for a familyof four in an urban area.The Administration contends that costfactors 'make any higher Federal guaranteeimpossible at this time and points out thatStatesupplementaryprogramswilladd signficantly to the Federal minimum. HEWestimates that the recommended $1600 basicPAP benefits will add $2.6 billion to currentFederal welfare costs, and that adding $100to the basic $1600 animal family of fourbenefit would cost the Federal Government$500 million.CoverageThe ommittes bill and the Administra-tion proposal both limit payments to families(defining family as a group of two, one ofwhom must be a child), and make no pro-vision for childless couples or single persona.Both extend present coverage to familiesheaded by full-time employed males (theworking poor) and families where the fatheris unemployed and at home. The Committeebill also makes provision for an estimated12,000 eligible military families, excluded inthe Administration proposal.Alternative proposals recommend univer-sal coverage with specific exclusions for ob-viously undeserving cases. The Administra-tidn points out that FAP will cover 20 mil-lion persons in 1971, compared' to the 6.7million currently on AF'DC rolls, and thatuniversal coverage would add 4.5 millionbeneficiaries \u00f1d coats of $1 billion to theprogram.Income exclusionsBoth the Committee bill and the Adminis-tration proposal contain a basic work incen-tive earned income exclusion of the first$720 per year plus one-half the remainder.The Administration proposal, however, con-tained an additional disregard of one-half ofunearned income (such as veteran's benefits,socialsecurity, and railroad retirement),which the Committee dropped, thereby re-ducing total benefits by $600 million.Tile Committee bill sets the amounts of ir-regular earned and unearned income allow-able at $30 per quarter for each type, left tothe determination of HEW in the Adminis-tration proposal. Setting an amount maymake this disregard more or less automatic,thereby in effect increasing the initial disre-gard from $720 to $960 per year and raisingthe breakeven point from $3920 to $4160.The Harris bill excludes the first $900 peryear of earned income, plus one-half the next$1800, plus one-fourth of the remainder. Thebill also defines earned income as net incomeafter deduction of the expenses of earningsuch income. These exclusion provisions would allow a family of four to earn up to$6300 and remain eligible.Work registration requirementsBoth the Administration proposal and theCommittee bill contain strict new provisionsrequiring PAP beneficiaries to register forwork training and employment. The Ad-ministration proposal, however, containedvirtually no labor standard safeguards andleft the definition of job \"suitability\" to theDepartment of Labor.The Committee bill includes labor stand-ard safeguards designed to insure that in-dividuals are not placed in unsuitable orexcessively low paying jobs, and that theyare not forced to cross picket lines or joincompany unions. The bill contains a newrequirement for mandatory registration ofthe working poor, doubling the total numberof registrants from 1.5 to 3 million. The billApril 16,lf)70also reduces the mandatory registration agefor non-students from 18 to 16.Alternative proposals, including the Har-ris bill, contain liberalized work training re-quirements. The Harris bill permits personsto refuse work training in cases where suit-ablejobsareunavailable and excludesmothers of school-age children from regis-tration and training requirements.State supplementationSince the Federal floor provided in boththe Administration proposal and the Com-mittee bill is below the level of payment inall but eight States, State supplementationprograms are necessary to insure that bene-ficiaries do not receive less than they arereceiving now. The Committee bill and theAdministration proposal contain equivalentformulas for determining benefits, but theCommittee bill formula for Federal' parti-cipation (30% Federal matching) generallyprovides greater relief than the Adminis-tration proposal to States 'currently makinggreater effort. The Committee bill would re-sult in an additional estimated cost to theFederal Government of $300 million. Theprovision for direct Federal matching fundsalso provides greater Federal leverage to in-sure State supplementation.The Committee bill contains a provisionnot in the Administration proposal that setsthe poverty level ($3720 for a family of four)as the maximum level to which benefits maybe supplemented with Federal matching,thereby affecting the two States (New Yorkand New Jersey) with benefit levels over$3720. The Commttte bill also contains aprovision absent from the Administrationproposal permitting HEW to provide for in-dividual cases that under FAP would receiveless than they are receiving now.Alternative proposals, including the Har-ris bill, recommend complete Federal financ-ing of public asst8tance and therefore makeno provision for State supplements. Suchproposals include the working poor andtherefore avoid work disincentives createdby excluding the working poor from Statesupplementary programs, as in the case inthe Administration proposal and the Com-mittee bill. Providing Federal matching forState supplements tothe working poorwould add to Federal and State costs of thebill.AdministrationThe Committee bill encourages Federaladministration by providing for full assump-tion of administrative costa-in cases whereStates choose to have the Federal Govern-ment make the basic PAP and State supple.mentary payment directly to the beneficiary.The Administration proposal provided forFederal assumption of only half of the coatsof administering the State supplemouts insuch cases. The Committee bill provides thesame incentive for Federal administrationof AABD programs while the Administrationproposal recommended only a 50% Federalcontribution.The Committee bill contains a new pro-vision for liability to the Federal Govern-ment for PAP benefits in cases of desertingparents during their period of absence. TheCommitteeinitsreportindicatesthat spouses of deserting parents are expected tocooperate fully with authorities in trackingdown miscreants under pain of loss of' theirbenefits.Alternative proposals, including the Harrisbill, recommend complete Federalization ofpublic assistance and therefore contain noprovision for joint Federal-State adminis-trative arrangements. Punitive administra-tive provisions are also not included in anyalternative proposals.Food stampsBoth the Administration proposal and theCommittee bill permit food stamps for FAPbeneficiaries. The Committee in Its report April 16,1.970notedthe desirability of providing bene-ficiaries higher cash payments only, but saidIt could not devise a program to accomplishthis end within Administration cost guide-lines.Alternative proposals, including the Harrisbill, recommend abolishing food stamp as-sistance in favor of a higher basic incomesupplement. Rep. Gibbons of the Committeein additional views recommends an Imme-diate integrated cash-benefit program, bothto eliminate the inequities of the food stampprogram and to save substantial adminis-trative costs.Manpower training and emplo'mentprogramsThe 1967 Amendments to the Social Se-c\u00fcrity Act provided for a work incentiveprogram (WIN) administered by the De-partment of Labor rather than HEW throughstate welfare administrations. The programfellbelow Congressional expectations be-cause of Department of Labor and HEWslowness in promulgating guidelines, vary-ing State interpretations of the guidelinesfor referral, inability of States to developeffective training programs, and inadequateprovision for child care services.Both the Committee bill and the dmln- istration proposal abolish the old WIN pro-gram and establish in its place a new Fed-eral program with tight referral provisionsto eliminate differing interpretations of re-ferral requirements. Both also contain spe-cific guidelines for Federal-State cooperationand coordination with existing programs.Both authorize about $600 million for ex-panded job training and day care facilities.In order to insure adequate day care fa-cilities,the Committeebillprovidesfor complete Federal financing for day care pro-grams, as opposed to 90% Federal matchingin the Administration proposal. The Commit-tee bill also contains Increased emphasis onspecial work projects where employment inthe regular economy Is not available, andon-the-jobtrainingwith new financingprovisions under the Department of Labor.Alternative proposalS recognize the ne-cessity of providing work training opportuni-ties for family assistance beneficiaries butstress the need to provide meaningful em-ployment, with the Federal government theemployer of last resort.CostsBoth the Administration proposal and theCommittee bill are estimated by HEW andthe Bureau of the Budget to add $4.4 BIL-LION to current public assistance expendi-tures In the first full year of operation. Bothprovide about $600 million for job trainingand day care and $300 million for adminis-tration In appropriation estimates.Estimates of costs are based on 1968 dataand are predicated on 100% participationin the programs. Estimates for administra-tive costs were made before Committee pro-vision for full Federal financing. Followingare the breakdowns for the Administrationproposal and the Committee bill:The Administration proposal would haveprovided an additional $3 BILLION In pay-ments to families, reduced by eliminationof the unearned income disregard to $2.6BILLION in the Committee bill.The Administration proposal would haveprovided $100 million in relief to the States(the 50%\u201490% formula), raised under thenew 30% Federal matching formula to $400million.The Administration proposal would haveprovided an additional $400 million for theaged, blind, and disabled, raised to $500million due to the Increase In the Federalminimum from $90 per month to $110 per month.Alternative proposals are estimated to addfrom $7 billion (Harris bill) to $30 billion(National Welfare Rights Organization) toCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014HOUSEpublic assistance costs in the first full yearof operation.AABD minimum benefitsThe Administration proposal contained aFederal minimum of $90 per month for aged,blind, and disabled persons with no otherincome. The Committee raised this mini-mum to $110 per month. The Committee billalso contains a new formula for Federalparticipation that makes It impossible forStates to avoid a contribution, as they couldhaveS under the Administration formula.2Alternative proposals recommend raisingthe Federal family assistance minimum toa level that would adequately cover presentAABD recipients and permit abolition ofcurrent AABD programs In favor of a singleFederal program ftr the needy.AABI) Income disregards and eligibilityrequirementsFor the blind the Administration pro-posal and the Committee bill both containa mandatory disregard of the first $85 permonth of earned Income plus one-half theremainder. In the State option disregards forthe aged and disabled, the Administrationallowed the first $20 per month of earnedincome plus one-half the remainder up to$80 per month (current law). The Commit-tee bill extends to the disabled the sameearnings disregard accorded the blind andpermits states to disregard the first $60per month plus one-half the remainder forthe aged.The Committee bill contains a provisionallowing a State option disregard of $7.50per month of earned or unearned income,and a mandatory $4 per month disregardfor Social Security recipients. The Commit-tee bill also drops a provision in the Ad-ministration proposal that expressly pro- hibited States from imposing property liens against aged, blind, or disabled Individualson account of benefits paid them.SEcTIoN FOUR. PAP(N.E.16311) POINTS OFCONTROvERSyThe family assistance plan as proposed in H.R. 16311 has raised a number of points of Controversy\u2014both in terms of general ap- proach and in terms of certain features. Fol-lowing are arguments for and against the basic plan and arguments for and against specific provisions.Basic planProponents of FAP contend that the planmakes significant improvements in the cur- rent family assistance structure. They makethe following points In its favor:PAP establishes Federal standards of eli- gibility that will eliminate inequitable treat-ment of recijents.PAP extends coverage to families headedby an unemployed father and to the work-ing poor, currently In effect in only -certainStates.PAP Containsincentivestoencourage States to opt for Federal administration of all public assistance programs.By establishing a Federal income floor, PAPwill reduce State and regional differences inthe level of benefits paid.While the Federal guarantee of $1600 per year for a family of four with no other in-come is too low, adoption of the program willgenerate a constituency to press for higherbenefits, as was the case with Social Se-Curity.Some critics of FAP believe the plan does 2theAdministration formula theFederal Government provided all of the first$50, half the next $15, and one-fourth theremainder (average witha $90 The Committeeformula is 90% of the first $65 and one- fourth the remainder (average Federal pay- ment with a $110 minimum: $58.50).not go far enough. They make the follow-ing points:H3175The Federal guarantee of $1600 per year fora family of four with no other Income isfar too low, and the bill makes no provisionfor even gradual raising of benefits to thepoverty level or for increases based on therise In the cost of living.FAP excludes childless couples and singleindividuals from coverage, denying benefitsto millions of needy people.FAP perpetuates the current Federal-Stateadministrative tangle and contains no pro-vision for even gradual Federal assumptionof all public assistance payments.Other critics of FAP believe the plan goestoo far. They make the following argu-ments:By extendingcoveragetounemployed fathers and the working poor, FAP will addbetween 10 and 15 million people to the wel-fare rolls and put us on the road to a guar-anteed Income.Provisions for Federalization will only cre-ate a massive permanent Fderal welfarebureaucracy.PAP attempts too much with insumcientfunds; available resources should instead beallocated to existing programs, particularlyjob training and child care, rather than ini-tiating a new program.Specific provisionsWoI'k Registration RequirementsPro: Work registration requirements willprovide an additional tool In getting peopleoff welfare rolls and onto employment rolls.Since 11 million mothers of children under18 are now working, welfare mothers shouldnot receive special treatment. Requiring theworking poor to register will permit up-grading of skills and allow the Departmentof Labor to develop a more adequate database from which to analyse poverty.Con: Registration requirements only per-petuate the myth that most welfare recipi-ents are shiftless chiselers, Requiring moth-ers of children over six to register is poten-tially harmful to the development of thechildren; mothers should be allowed to de-termine the extent to which their presenceis needed in the home. The requirement thatthe working poor register will swamp Stateunemployment services. The bill in additionestablishes no priorities for referral of regis-trants for job training. The working poor(includingthemembersoftheArmed Forces), mothers of children under six vol-unteering for training, and unemployed fa-thers will all get the same treatment.Work IncentivesPro: By permitting people to hold full-time jobs while still receiving family assist-ance the bill significantly reduces the in-centive to quit work and go on welfare. TheFederal uniform Initial work incentive ex-clusion of $720 per month plus One-half theremainder allows individuals to keep enoughearnings to make work worthwhile and su- percedes with a greater incentive varyingamounts allowed under existing law.Con: The so-called Initial $720 plus one- half the remainder work incentive In thebill in fact excludes only that amount of money needed to meet the costs ot em-ployment, already provided for in the 1967AmendmentsThemuch-advertised50% marginal tax rate is deceptive, because whenone takes other public assistance income suchas food stamps and State supplements intoaccount and deducts expenses such as State and local taxes, as much as 90% of each dollar over $720 is deducted, thereby elimi-listing the financial work incentives In thebill.Work Training and Child Care ProgramsPro: Work training and employment pro- grams are essential to provide individualswith the ability to obtain adequately payingemployment and get off welfare. Since suc-cessful work training programs depend inlarge measure on adequwte day care facili-ties, the Committee bill ptovldes full Federal H 3176financing for day care, which will spur de-velopment of day care faciUties by the Statesand localities.Con: Emphasis on work training programsdiverts attention from the real problem\u2014the lack of meaningful employment at anadequate wage in many areas of the country.Training people for non-existent jobs willonly crowd an already tight job market.Work training programs In any event de-pend on adequate child care facilities, ob-structed not by lack of Federal money butby State and local inability to develop qual-ity programs.Need Determination and DisregardsPro: The new Federal need determinationand disregard provisions will save State ad-ministrative costs and insure that recipientsare treated equally In all Jurisdictions. Dis-regards are necessary to keep costs of theprogram down and still provide for those ingreatest need by providing for the wide va-riety of personal circumstances in whichbeneficiaries find themselves.Con: The need determination and disre-gard provisions of the bill will prove almostimpossible to administer and will require animmense new Federal bureaucracy. Suchprovisions should be eliminated in favor ofan income guarantee for all Americans. Spe-cific inequities in the bill include:Discrimination against those of college-age receiving room-and-board scholarships,because of a provision for disregard of tui-tion only.Incentive for families to spend their lim-i(ed savings or life-insurance on additionalhousehold goods to qualify for benefits.Unemployment DefinitionBoth supporters and critics agree that oneof the major shortcomings of the bill is itsreliance on the current definition of unem-ployment as working less than 30 hours aweek. As long as the working poor are ex-cluded from Federally assisted State sup-plementary programs, the current definitioncreates a work disincentive for many work-ing poor. Individuals in States with a levelof payment over $2100 can receive additionalIncome (and, in some States, qualify forMedicaid)if they can come close to theirpresent income by working 30 hours aweek Instead of full-time.One remedy would be to define unemploy-ment as working 20 hours a week or less,thus making it difficult for a person to earnnear his present income and still qualifyas unemployed. Alternatively, State supple-ments could be extended to the workingpoor, but this proposal would add to Federaland State costs of the bill.APPENDIx I. HOW TO DETERMINE A FAMILYSUPPLEMENTThe amount of assistance a family couldreceive under HR. 16311 wIll vary dependingupon many factors, including the numberof person in the family, the family's income,and the State In which t.he family resides.To determine the family's total supplementfor all but eight states 8onemust first deter-mine the amount of the Federal supplementand then the amount of the State supple-ment.Federal supplementDetermining the Federal supplement is athree-step process:1. Subtract $720 from total family earn-tags;2. DIvide this amount by two; and3. Subtract this figure from the basic FAPbenefit ($500 for each of the first two plus$300 for each additional family member).8Because they currently pay less than thebasic FAP benefit, the Federal supplementwould be the total benefit In Alabama, Ar-kansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Mis-souri, South Carolina, Tennessee.Thus a family of four with total earningsof $2,000 (and no disregardable income minus $640 equals$980 Federal supplement.State supplementDetermining the State supplement is alsoat three step process:1. Find the differenCe between the followingamounts: Earnings minus $720; one-third ofearnings minus $720 (up to $3,200;2. Add the family's Federal supplement tothis amount;3. Subtract this figure .from the State'scurrent level of payment (determined fromtable on reverse side).Thus our family of four with $2,000 inearned income (and no disregards) if it livedin Illinois (level of payment: $3,228) would receive a supplement for Illinoisfamily of four earning $2,000 a year wouldbe 4,35AFDC annualized Levels of payment for afamily 0/jour (our adult plus three chil-dren)with child in school, the value offood stamps, and irregular or infrequentamounts up to $30 a quarter for each type.In order to be eligible for any state sup-plement, our sample family would have toearn $2,000 with no member working over 30hours a week if the family lived in a Statewith no program for the working poor.\u00b0An additional provision, applicable tofamilies with an Income past the PAP break-even point ($3,920) but still eligible for statesupplements. provides for exclusion of one-fifth of remaining income.Proed our family did not live In oneof the few States that impose a maximum, Ifthe maximum were below this amount.April 16, A WELFARE GLOSSARYAABD\u2014AId to the Aged, Blind and Dis-abled, the new assistance program for theaged, blind, and disabled persons. it combinesthree separate Federal-State programs foraid to the aged (OAA) ,aidto the blind (AB),and the aid to the permanent and totallydisabled (APTD).APDC\u2014AId to Families with DependentChildren (formerly ADC), the currently op-erating Federal-State program for assistingfamilies with dependent children.Breakeven Point\u2014That level of. earned In-come at which the amount of public assist-ance available a beneficiary is reduced tozero. This point also denotes the coverage ofthe program.Determination of Need__Features of a billthat outline eligibility for assistance, such aspermissible assets, relative responsibility re-quirements, and age or disability definitions.Disregards\u2014Incomethatneednotbe counted in determining the benefit level ofan Individual receiving public assistance.Earned Income\u2014AS used in H.R. 16311, allremuneration for services performed as anemployee and net earnings from self-employ-ment.Minimum\u2014The lowest amount of totalIncome, set by law, that an Individual Oflpublic assistance must receive.

Mr. Chairman, I yield3 mInutes to the gentleman from NorthCarolina (Mr. RUTH).(Mr. RUTH asked and was given per-mission to revise and extend his re-marks.)Mr. RUTH. Mr. Chairman, for severalweeks I have been telling my constitu-ents that I would like to hear the debatebefore making up my mind on this Issue,CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSE April 16, 1.970andthere are several points that I wouldlike to mention.First, for a bill of this magnitude I amdisappointed that the proponents arenot talking about the merits of the bill tothe extent that they are saying: It is bet-ter than what we have.Second, if a pilot program has beenconducted in two States for about a year,it seems we should either have more defi-nite evidence or wait until we have more-evidence as to its effectiveness.Third, it seems if this were a businessenterprise the chairman would be saying\"We have a failure on our hands. Weare going to change a few formulas, in-clude more people, refinance it, and tryit some more\".Fourth, I hate t see the campaigns ofthe future become based on the amountof the guaranteed income promised bythe candidates.Fifth, I hope we do not vote for workincentives which turn out to be just theopposite. We should be less concernedwith what we hope this bill would do,and more concerned with what the billwill actually do.The CHAIRMAN. The Chair will ad-vise the Members that the gentlemanfrom Wisconsin (Mr. BYRNES) has 24minutes remaining, and the gentlemanfrom Arkansas (Mr. MILLS) has 20 min-utes remaining.Mr. CONABLE. Mr. Chairman, I yield5 minutes to the distinguished gentlemanfrom New Hampshire (Mr. CLEVELAND).(Mr. CLEVELAND asked and wasgiven permission to revise and extendhis remarks.)Mr. CLEVELAND. Mr. Chairman, Ihave taken this time to inquire furtherfrom the gentleman from Arkansas andthe gentleman from Wisconsin concern-ing details of this bill. One of the ques-tions I would like to ask of the gentle-man from Arkansas, who is on the floor,is that I am concerned about the ruralpoor, The President stated in his stateof the Union message that we probablyshould do what we can to redress the out-migration problem caused by people leav-ing the rural areas and piling up in thecities where they often create so manyproblems.So, addressing ourselves to the pro-visions of this bill as they pertain toworking poor families, I know that atleast in my State some of the unemploy-ment compensation offices are scattered.I wondered if the committee has studiedthe problem of how somebody would go,say, 40 or 50 or 60 miles to register forthe provisions of this legislation.Then another question comes up. If,after he has registered and under theprovisions of this act he is going to berequired to take training, if he comesfrom a small rural town, is it going tobe possible to set up a training programin that small town?I wonder if the chairman would re-spond to those questions?Mr. MILLS. If the gentleman will yield,yes, I have the same degree of concern,I might say, that the gentleman has inthis very problem. Like the gentleman,I have a lot of these areas that are smallcommunities in my district. I would callthe attention of the gentleman to theCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEfact that there are these employmentservices or security offices scattered allover with at least one in the counties.That is the case in my own State.Mr. CLEVELAND. Yes, but we havesome pretty large counties.Mr. MILLS. I understand that. Therewould be no payment to an individualfrom any agency of the Government, un-less the welfare department of the Statewould do it, to provide the transporta-tion into the office to register. He wouldhave to do that.But if he is assigned to a training pro-gram, then itis possible for the em-ployment security office to make avail-able to him the cost of transportationto and from his training, if that Is nec-essary, to make it possible for him totake a course in training.This is not necessarily a matter oftraining 50 people at the same time, youunderstand, which might be training inautomotive mechanics or something likethat. This is directed more toward in-dividualized training.Mr. CLEVELAND. However, the factis that some of these training programscould not possibly be set up in the ruralareas and that they would have to travel ?Mr. MILLS. In my own area, I can en-vision a situation where three countiesmight be included for the purposes ofone training center. But the employmentsecurity office would have to make avail-able to the individual such transporta-tion as necessary to enable him to carryout their instructions to attend a courseof training. They would have to do that.Mr. CLEVELAND. I thank the gentle-man.Mr. Chairman, I would comment sim-ply by saying that I do not think thiscan be cpnsidered as enoouraging peopleto stay in the rural areas. I think it is,if anything, going to give an incentiveto move into or toward urban areaswhere they can travel a short distance toapply and travel a short distance to theirtraining program, and where inevitablythe recommended job will be located.Mr. MILLS. I have just the oppositeview on it because I know in my area thetendency now is for many of our peoplewho have been on the farms all their life,when adversity comes along and theyfind they are not making the living onthe farm that they want to, to go to thecity. I think that here we have some de-gree of opportunity to train these peoplein the rural areas for employment. Itmay be in a town where they get that em-ployment or within the city. But theycould take their training while they areat home, and at least they do not have togo into the city to get that.Mr. CLEVELAND. Ihave anotherquestion that I would like to ask, If thechairman would be so kind.Is there any provision in this bill whichdeals with the question as to whetherpeople who register under the provi-sions of this act\u2014whether their nameswill be made public under our public in-formation laws?Mr. MILLS. There is a special regula-tion within the Department of Health,Education, and Welfare dealing withthese matters prohibiting, say, a news-H 3177paper from going to an office and gettinga full list of these names. The names ofthese people will be made available toprospective employers; that is, to peoplewho have a right to know who they are.Mr. CLEVELAND. To a certain extent,they will be published?Mr. MILLS. Yes; to that extent.Mr. CLEVELAND. Thank you.Mr. Chairman, I regret that there isno more time to explore a number ofother questions which I have about thisprogram, and which I have not heardsatisfactorily answered in this debate.A significant point is that the pro-posed billwill more than double thenumber of persons who will be registeredat the State employment security offices;Though Congress may get around to In-creasing the appropriation to providefor this, I personally tend to doubt it.Will we be prepared for the deluge of ap-plicants which will descend upon theemployment security offices?A second aspect of this bill which Iquestion is that social security recip-ients who qualify for family assistancepayments will have to register with em-ployment security for a job,, and willhave their FAP reduced by the amountof their social security payments. Yetif these same people want to help them-selves Instead of relying on the dole, theyrun Into a $1,680 earnings limit. Theyare discouraged from working, and en-couraged to subsist on their Govern-ment check. Is this not a basic contra-diction?The whole area of cost estimates forthis proposal deserves thorough ques-tioning. The data on which the costguesses are made are based on a 1966\u201467 study which was updated to 1968, andnow projected to 1971 and beyond. Thisis quite unrealistic.Hard figures on which we will be ableto base our estimates will soon be avail-able, in the form of that long 1970 censuswhich we all filled out recently. It istragic to have to misuse bad statisticswhen good ones will soon be available.Given our experience with medicareand medicaid, where the actual cost hasfar outrun earlier predictions, should wenot be candid and admit that the actualcost will be much higher? I might addthat it is interesting that some of thesame people who are outraged by mili-tary cost overruns are now willing to ac-cept low estimates of the cost of thefamily assistance plan in order to pro-mote acceptance.I also question very seriously estimatesof proponents that the FAP, which willdouble the number of people on the rolls,will by 1975 be costing only a little morethan existing programs would If we didnot change them. In order to determinethe anticipated cost of existing pro-grams, It unchanged, it is assumed thatboth caseload and costs will continue toincrease at the same rate as over the past3 years. XFDC benefit schedules are ad-justed upward yearly to compensate forcost of living increases, and the pro-jected costs assume that this would con-tinue. But, the estimates for the familyassistance plan assume that until 1975there will be no increase in the $1,600level of benefits. 113178Can we honestly say that we are notgoing to give periodic increases to com-pensate for inflation, just as we do in allother programs? Yet if we do, the FAPwill be much more expensive than eventhe existing program.Not only are the cost projections sus-pect, but the Legislative Reference Serv-ice tells me that there is reason to be-lieve that the recent rapid growth in thecaseload of AFDC is leveling out. Yet thefigures cited project that the rate of in-crease will be the same as that of thelast three years. This too should be clari-fied.Mr. Spea.ker, by no means am I op-posed to giving to those truly in needand my record amply proves that. How-ever, I raise these questions because Idoubt whether the proposed reforms areany better than the existing situationwhich apparently we all deplore. Aboutthe only thing that is certain about thefamily assistance plan is that it will im-mediaely add at least 10 to 15 millionpeople to the welfare rolls.About the lowest estimate of its costput forth is approximately $5 billion. Forthis same amount, we could adopt theProuty proposals to give all social secu-rity recipients adequate retirement in-come\u2014$1,800 for one person, $2,400 fortwo people\u2014as well as eliminate the anti-incentive earnings limit on social secu-rity for all people over 65. This certainlyseems a better place to put our dollars,if we want to put them where they woulddo some real good at no additional ad-ministrative cost.Mr. MILLS. Mr. Chairman, I yield tothegentleman from Louisiana (Mr.BOGGS) 5 minutes.Mr. BOGGS. Mr. Chairman, we arecoming to the end of this debate which,in my judgment, has been a most signifi-cant and enlightening one in attemptingto show to the Members of the House thepressing need for welfare reform in ourcountry.As all of you know, this bill came tothe floor after many weeks of intensivehearings and after many weeks of execu-tive sessions in the Committee on Waysand Means, with only three of the 25members on the committee against it.I venture to say that more than a ma-jority of the members on the Commit-tee on Ways and Means at the begin-fling of the hearings approached the pro-posals with considerable misgivings. Butafter examining alternatives, and afterlooking hard, carefully, and critically atthe existing welfare programs and howthey have worked over the past 30 years\u2014after that very intensive study and veryIntensive debate, the committee came, asI said, almost to a unanimous conclusionthat this was the proper and right thingto do.There is almost universal agreementamong those concerned with our presentwelfare system that that system, partic-ularly with respect to the program forneedy families with children, has failed.This bill is being proposed to remedy thissituation by an approach that recognizesthat we can no longer attempt to pafchup what is basically an unsound struc-ture.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEThe present AFDC program is charac-terized by incentives to family breakupand by the inequitable exclusion fromassistance of poor families in which thefather is employed. The time has cometo replace this program with an entirelynew prograni\u2014thefamilyassistance plan. Under this plan, for the first time,on a nationwide basis, families with un-employed fathers would be able to receivebenefits; at present, AFDC benefits areavailable to such families in some Statesbut. not in others. Also, working poorfamilies would be provided assistance, forthe first time, on a nationwide basis.It is time we recognized that It is hadsocial policy to have families in like sit-uations treated differently because oXthe employment status of the familyhead\u2014a policy that has all too of teTlmade it more attractive to go on welfarethan to go to work. The exclusion of fam-ilies in which the father is working hasacted as an incentive for fathers to be-come unemployed or leave home in or-der to qualify their families for assist-ance. H.R. 16311 would do much to cor-rect these Inequities.Another inequity to which this billaddresses itself, and in my opinion suc-cessfully, is the wide variation In pay-ment levels and conditions of eligibilityamong the present State programs. Un-der this bill, all dependent families withchildren in America, regardless of wherethey live, would be assured of a Federalminimum standard of income\u2014$1,600for a family of four\u2014based upon uniformeligibility standards. Moreover, familieswill be able to keep a fair share of theirearnings. The first $720 of earnings ayear will be completely disregarded, andabove this amount, benefits will be re-duced by only $1 for every $2 of earningsThis treatment of earned income wouldprovide a strong Incentive both to takeemployment and to increase one's earn-ings. A family with a working memberwill always be better off than a familywithout a working member. This provi-sion gives recognition in the case of thewelfare recipient of a fact of life sofundamental and so obvious that the restof us have always taken it for granted\u2014simply that if a person would be betteroff working than not working, he willwork. To illustrate the effect of thisprovision, it would be possible, for a fam-ily of four to receive some benefits un-der the program until its Income reached$3,920. As the family's income Increasesover the basic $720 of exempted income,its benefit payment would, of course, bereduced.In addition to the obvious advantage tothe recipient of uniform eligibility stand-ards is the fact that such standards al-low for uniform administrative mecha-nisms, so that we could take advantageof the economies of scale that are pos-sible with an automated and nationallyadministered system.Another important reform providedunder the billis the requirement thatevery able-bodied adult member of afamily\u2014except mothers who have pre-school-age children or others specifical-ly exempted such as those with a dis-abled family member to care for\u2014regis-April 16,1970ter for work or training. There Is no othersingle provision In this bill that Is morefundamental to the success of our effortsto transform welfare Into workf are thanthese provisions for work and training.Another important change this bill would make in the present welfare sys-tem relates to the programs which pro-vide aid to our citizens who are in finan-cial need due to old age or due to blind-ness or other crippling disabilities. It isimportantthatwenotallowthe urgent need to reform the program ofaid to families with dependent childrento overshadow our concern for and com-mitment to our older citizens. I havebeen greatly concerned about the inade-quacy and unevennness of assistancepayments now being made to recipientsof aid under the adult categories.I am pleased that this bill would takeconstructive and very much needed stepsto revise and Improve the substance andoperation of these adult programs. Inparticular, the bill would require thatStates assure that each aged, blind, anddisabled adultwillreceive assistancesufficient to bring his total income upto at least $110 a month. This measureshould be of great help to our older needycitizens who are fInding it Increasinglydifficult under the Inflationary condi-tions that prevail today to live on theirpresent fixed Inadequate Incomes.I am also glad to see that the billwould provide more uniform require-ments under the adult programs for sucheligibility factors as the level and typeof resources allowed and the degree ofdisabilityand blindnessrequiredto qualify for assistance. In addition, thebill would liberalize the earnings exemp-tions under these programs. The earn-ings exemption for recipients of old-ageassistance, which Is optional with theStates, would be made consistent withthat under the family assistance pro-gram\u2014the first $60 a month plus one-half of the remainder. The exemption forthe severely disabled would be made con-sistent with that which has been In effectfor some years for the blind\u2014a manda-tory exemption of the first $85 a monthplus one-half of the remainder. I believethis latter provision should go a long waytoward providing real encouragement tothe severely disabled to accept rehabili-tation services and employment withintheir capacities.I am also pleased that under this bill,the Federal Government will make astrong contribution toward relieving thefinancial burden of the States. In orderto assist the States In making supplemen-tary payments, the bill provides that theFederal Government would pay 30 per-cent of a State's supplementary paymentcosts up to the poverty level. This rep-resents an important Improvement overthe original proposal under which Stateswere assured a savings of 10 to 50 per-cent of their costs In the federally as-sisted public assistance programs.The inclusion of the new provisionunder which the Federal Governmentwill pay 30 percent of a State's sup-plementary payment costs should go along way toward providing relief for thefinancially overburdened States and In a April 16,1970waywhich would, in general, help Stateswhich have been making greater flscaleffortintheirwelfare programsto achieve more savings than they wouldhave under the original proposal. More-over, the provisions of the reported billprovide additional financial assistance toStates that increase their supplementarypayment levels up to the poverty Indexlevel, whereas the original version ofthe administration bill would have actedas a disincentive upon the States to keeptheir payments in line with increasedliving costs.In voting for this bill we are rec-ognizing that the vast majority of Ameri-cans do not want to be on welfare. Theywant to have the opportunity to earndecent livelihoods without the constantknock on the door by the social worker,the person who checks on them andmakes their lives miserable, degrading,and embarrassing. In addition, the ad-ministration of the present program bythe States is frightfully expensive.This bill does not come here only withth9 recommendation of the members ofthe Ways and Means Committee. It comushere with the active support of the Presi-dent and his Department of Health, Edu-cation, and Welfare. It has been sug-gested and supported by Important seg-ments of both political parties, both theDemocrats and Republicans. It has todaythe active support of the business com-munity. It has only recently been thor-oughly examined by a most representa-tive Presidential commission, which gaveits full and entire approval to the pro-posals of the committee.Obviously, Mr. Chairman, the bill Isnot the answer to all our problems, butIt Is certainly a step in the right direc-tion. It is a step that states that we shallrely upon the ability of men and womento earn their own way. In this societywhere the gross national product ap-proaches a trillion dollars, the idea thatwe will have continuing poverty Is onethat our Nation quite properly rejects.This bill is a step In that direction. Icongratulate the members of my com-mittee for the tremendous amount oftime and effort which they have given tothe bill. It comes here not alone but aspart of a reform package of many parts.We are now conducting intensive hear-ings Into social security generally and in-to medicare and medicaid. Hopefully, bythe end of this session, we shall havelegislated constructively in the field ofwelfare, in field of family assistance, Inthe reform and extension and moderni-zation of social security, and a similarteform and modification of medicare andmedicaid. It Is part of an overall pack-age designed to realistically approachthese problems of welfare and social se-curity, and I hope that the committeewill be sustained by a substantial major-ity of the House of Representatives.Mr. CONABLE. Mr. Chairman, I yieldmyself 8 minutes.(Mr. CONABLE asked and was givenpermission to revise and extend his re-marks.)Mr. CONABLE. Mr. Chairman, and mycolleagues,one thingthat we haveproven In the past 2 days of debate hasbeen that Alexander Pope knew what heCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014HOUSEwas talking about when he said in oneof his famous' couplets:All looks yellow to the jaundiced eye.I do not blame my colleagues for be-ing a little jaundiced about this wholesubject of welfare. It has been a veryvisible part of our social structure. It hasbeen subject to a great deal of criticismbecause it has not been working. We arenot so much trapped in a semantic senseas embarrassed by the emotional sur-charge that the word has acquired overthe years of misdirection of our welfareprogram.And when we hear, as our leaders haveexplained that we are adding several mu..lion people to the welfare rolls, thatmeans something to us that frightens usinstinctively, because when we think ofthe welfare rolls we think of people whoare not working but who are participat-ing in the largess of the taxpayers, theproductive elements of our society.When we talk about adding people tothe welfare rolls in this bill, we are notdescribing welfare inthe traditionalsense. Of the millions that are added,many are going to be added only in aperipheral sense. They are going to bepeople who will receive only a modestamount. They are people who are alreadyworking and who are ineligible for wel-fare now, because they are working. Inshort, under the bill they are going to bereceiving supplements, not traditionalwelfare.This is the only way in fact that wecan design a bill that will make it worth-while for people to work. I do not knowabout my colleagues, but I will tell Mem-bers that one of the toughest letters Ihave to answer is the letter which comesfrom a man who says that he works veryiriard he has been working all his life-time, and he has never been able to par-ticipate in the affluence of America. Thefellow across the street from him, hiswife and children are on welfare, and heis making more money than the manwho works. Therefore, he asks, whyshould he continue to work when It Iscosting him money.We have talked a great deal about in-centives, and those who have been view-ing this bill with a jaundiced eye havesaid the incentive program built Into thisbill is not going to work. In fact, theysay we are just adding millions to thewelfare rolls and increasing dependenc'rather than reducing It.Mr. Chairman, this. country has paidmore than lipservice to the Incentivesystem for 300 years. The incentive sys-tem has served this country well, al-though only 90 percent of our populacehas been participating in an incen-tive system. The bottom 10 percent hashad a disincentive to work. In fact, theyhave been criticized by members of theirown families on occasion for refusing togo on welfare, because It was economi-cally advantageous for them to do so.Mr. HAYS. Mr. Chairman, will thegentleman yield?Mr. CONABLE. I yield to the gentle-man from Ohio.Mr. HAYS. Mr. Chairman, I was alittle cqrious about this Incentive, andI am sincere about It.If a man, say,with two children is eligible for a supple-H3179ment under thisbill, and across thestreet there is a man with 10 children,and he is also eligible, will the man with10 children\u2014as I understand it, he will\u2014receive more supplements than the fel-low with two?Mr. CONABLE. That is correct.Mr. HAYS. Then the question arisesIn my mind, is this an incentive to workor an incentive to have more children?Mr. CONABLE. Let me say I do notthink many people would consider $300a year adequate incentive to generateanother hungry mouth to feed. I ques-tion whether the generation of childrenis usually a matter of economic incentive.We have to deal with the families asthey are, and nobody would want to giveany family the incentive to dispose ofchildren.Mr. HAYS. I understand that, butthere are people\u2014for instance, there isa fellow in my hometown who has beenon welfare all his life, and he has had11 chiidren and raised all of them onwelfare, and they are raising their chil-dren on welfare. They are exactly thetype, if they can get $300 for more chil-dren, who would have more if they could.There are no racial overtones in this,because the fellow happens to be aCaucasian.Mr. CONABLE. The gentleman fromOhio is falling into the very same trapI have been talking about. He is talkingabout the welfare system as it Is now,and that has, in fact, put many peopleIn the situation where the only way theycould improve their economic circum-stances was to have more children. Thefact is that this bill provides a new workincentive Instead of a children-produc-ing Incentive in the sense the gentlemanis talking about.Mr. HAYS. I hope It does, but It seemsto me that it provides both.Mr. MILLS. Mr. Chairman, will thegentleman yield?Mr. CONABLE. I yield to the gentle-man from Arkansas, the chaIrman ofthe committee.Mr. MILLS. Mr. Chairman, I wouldlike to call to the attention of my friend,the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. HAYS),the fact that in this bill there is moreIncentive to work, bearing in mind thatthe person who was mentioned by thegentleman from Ohio will not continueon this program to get one penny forhimself until he goes to the employmentoffice and registersfor work and/ortraining. He must do that before hecan even get one cent.Mr. HAYS. He will have a doctor'scertificate to say that he Is not able towork.Mr. MILLS. Then he is not able towork.Mr. HAYS. He is able, but he will geta certificate from his doctor stating heIs not able.Mr. MILLS. If the gentleman willyield further, the local officeof the agency in the gentleman's hometownwhere the person applies for benefitsor is referred for training and work willhave their own doctors and they canexamine that gentleman.Mr. CONABLE. Mr. Chairman, thecritics of this plan have attacked. H 3180Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, willthe gentleman yield?Mr. CONABLE. I yield the gentle-man from Michigan.Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I justwanted to assure my colleague, the gen-tleman from Ohio, that when he pointedout the case of the man the gentlemanknew in his hometown, whom he knewall his life, and who was raising hiskids, the gentleman suspected, to stayon welfare, when I started to rise it wasnot because I suspected that constituentto be of one particular race or the other.I want to assure the gentleman ofthat. I am glad he explained who thisperson was.I have some disagreement, not on thequestion of the ethnic background ofthat one single person mentioned. I amsorry he is in the gentleman's town andis a constituent.Iwas questioningthe premiseof whether or not we are going to let oneperson like that stop this kind of aprogram. I believe there are probablysome people like that in every Member'sdistrict, but I am not prepared at thistime to say that this very minimal billshould not go through.Mr. HAYS. Mr. Chairman, will thegentleman yield?Mr. CONABLE. I yield very briefly tothe gentleman from Ohio.Mr. HAYS. I can say to the gentleman,this Is not the only case like that I knowof. I could cite many of them. I cited thisone because it is an extreme case andbecause I know it better than others.Mr. CONABLE. I hope the gentlemanwill give the incentive system an oppor-tunity to work by acknowledging the ob-vious economic advantage this bill givesto those who go to work or continue towork.The CHAIRMAN. The time of thegentleman from New York has expired.Mr. BYRNEE of Wisconsin. Mr. Chair-man, I yield the gentleman 1 additionalminute.Mr. MILLS. Mr. Chairman, I yield thegentleman 1 additional minute.Mr. CONABLE. Mr. Chairman, I shouldlike to address myself briefly to the is-sue of the suitability of the job offeredthe welfare recipient.The point that must be made and can-not be made frequently enough is thatthe suitability Is not going to be deter-mined by the recipient himself or by atraditionally minded welfare worker. TheIssue of suitability is going to be deter-mined by the Labor Department.Frankly, we have to be tough on thisIssue because of the very type of welfarerecipient the gentleman from Ohio wasreferring to. I believe the American peo-ple, the American taxpayers, except noless.On this Issue of suitability, it has beenvilthin our Intent to limit it to the deter-mination of the Labor Department fromthe word \"go.\"I realize there is a good deal of misgiv-ing about this, and I hope It can becleared up not only through our discus-sion of legislative intent but also In otherways.Mr. Chairman, I yield back the re-mainder of my time.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEThe CHAIRMAN.

Mr. Chairman, will thegentleman yield?Mr. COLLIER. I am delighted to yieldto the gentleman from New York.(Mr. ROBISON asked and was givenpermissiontorevise and extend hisremarks.)Mr. ROBISON. Mr. Chairman, in themonths of debate and discussion whichhave preceded our formal considerationof the administration's family assistanceplan, I have been impressed with theoverwhelming fact that no one seems pre-pared to defend our present system ofwelfare. Good men may argue about theadvisability of the new program beforeus, but everyone seems to agree that thesystem we have developed, in patchquiltform, over the past 35 years Is not ful-filling its purpose or achieving its statedobjectives. The difficulties with the pastprogram\u2014both conceptual and logisti-cal\u2014are well known to all of us, and neednot be detailed again. But, in retrospect,I am surprised at how long we have tol-erated a social services system whichactually encourages men to leave theirfamilie&\u2014so that their children, legiti-mate or not, would be eligible for in-creased welfare assistance. I am surprisedthat we have accepted, as a fact of ourfederal system, the wide diversity amongStates iii the amounts given to families\u2014who, after all, are as destitute in oneState as In another. I am surprised thatwe have been so complacent about a sys-tem which provided such an incompleteincentive to work. I am surprised thatwe have not before seen the overridingneed for widespread availability of day-care centers and training programs tobe directly coordinated with any nationalprogram of assistance.And It is with this backdrop, and withthis appreciation o our basic problemswith what has evolved In the past, that Iam especially hopeful about the familyassistance plan which we now consider.As a Republican who holds the belief thathis party can well be the vehicle forpeacefuland orderly progress, lam proudof President Nixon's leadersl1p in pro-viding what he has rightly called, \"anApril 16,1970income strategy to deal with our mostpressing domestic problem.\"This \"strategy\" is carried out underthe family assistance plan in severalways. The working poor with childrenare incorporated into the social servicessystem by having their earnings supple-mented if their income is below the pov-erty level, so as to guarantee that theywill always be making more money byworking than they would by stayinghome. All adult recipients, who are notdisabled, are required to register for workor job opportunity training, unless theindividual is a mother of a child 6 yearsor younger. A Federal floor is establishedwhich will serve to narrow the gapamong the various States in welfare pay-ments. In addition, these specific com-ponents of the program are coordinatedwith a greater emphasis on providingday-care centers in the proximity of theaffected families and on providing train-ing opportunities for those without theskills necessary to procure dignified andworthwhile employment.By a combination of these provisions,and together with food-stamp assist-ance, the early effect of this plan willbe to lift some 7,000,000 low-income peo-ple above the official poverty level of$3,400 yearly for a family of four.But it is not my purpose to scrutinizethe details of the program itself. In-stead, I wish to comment briefly on themanner in which this piece of legtsla-tion was developed and presented, be-cause I believe that we can all learnsomething from it. This is one of themost fundamental and significant do-mestic reforms which has been consid-ered in my 13 years in the Congress. Yetwe do not herald in this program withslogans which go far beyond this onebill's promise; we do not guarantee tothe American people that this bill alonewill still the turmoil in this Nation; wedo not insure that poverty will hereafterdisappear or that the program will meeteveryone's need in every way. Rather,from the President on down, effective ac-tion has been quietly taken without theunnecessary bravado which, in the past,has so often come back to haunt us.The President often has been criticizedfor not being sensitive to the needs ofthe ghetto dwellers, the rural poor, theblacks, the Chicanos, the Indians, andso forth. And, in truth, he has not madesome of the ringing, sweeping statementspopularized by some of our recent Presi-dents. But here in this bill, as is thecase in such areas as revenue-sharing,educational loans, executive reorganiza-tion, and reordering of budgetary priori-ties, Mr. Nixon has said less but donemore than his detractors seem to want toadmit.The word \"meaningful\" has becomemilked dry by so many people for somany purposes that I hesitate to useit at all anymore. But if the word con-tinues to have any vitality at all, it doesso in describing legislation such as this,for the Family Assistance Act of -1970 istruly meaningful\u2014as an indication ofthis administration's concern for thedisenfranchised of our society; as a re-form of the outdated, inequitable, chao-tic welfare system we currently tolerate;atmd as a method by which we can better ApriL 16, 1970 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014HOUSE H3181serve, and train, and educate familiesin need. This is a responsible and re-sponsive piece of innovative legislation.I salute the President for initiating it,and I salute the leaders of both partieshere in the House for their expeditiousand careful study of it. The adoption ofthis measure, coming as it does so earlyin 1970, might well portend this shall bethe decade of hope and real accomplish-ment; as contrasted to the 1960's, whichbecame, sorrowfully enough, the decadeof disillusionment and unfulfilled prom-ises.Mr. COT.T.rPR.Mr. Chairman,all throughout the debate and discussionof this bill for the past 2 days it has be-come apparent that many Members ofthis House would firmly support the bill,believe in the fundamental concept andprinciple it embraces, but understand-ably have some reservation about the useof the word \"suitable\" In determining ac-ceptance of employment by the welfareapplicant.They indeed have some reservation\u2014and again understandably so\u2014about thedefinition, which they contend is ambig-uous and perhaps might be a loopholein terms of making the program work inaccordance with the intent of the com-mittee and the legislation itself.Therefore, I intend at the proper timeto offer a recommittal motion. I shall doso as a firm supporter of welfare reformlegislation. The motion in sum and sub-stance would remove the word \"suitable\"as a part of the language of the bill, aswell as the definition. In order to do thiswe would strike section 448(b) (1) of thepresent bill but would make certain thatthe labor standards as they appear insection 448(B) (2) would be preserved.I trust in offering this recommittalmotion that this will eliminate what Ithink is the prime objection of manyMembers of the House who otherwisewill support this bill.Mr. GROSS. Mr. Chairman, will thegentleman yield to me?Mr. COLLIER. I yield to the gentle-man from Iowa.Mr. GROSS. That sounds to me a gooddeal like gimmickry. Why not a motionto recommit striking out the guaranteedannual income?Mr. COLLIER. I cannot be responsi-ble for what the gentleman from Iowaconstrues this amendment to be. If hethinks it is gimmickry, the fact is thathe is wrong.Mr. COLMER. Mr. Chairman, will thegentleman yield to COT.T.TR. I yield to the gentle-man from Mississippi.Mr. COLMER. I appreciate the gentle-man's graciousness in yielding to me. Ido so for the purpose of asking the ques-tion that now that those in charge of thislegislation have denied the Committee ofthe Wole here any right to amend thebill is it the purpose of the minority toinsure that there cannot be a vote onthis particular matter with this minoramendment here which would not giveus a clear vote on that issue?Mr. COLLTR. The gentleman fromMississippi has been in this House muchlonger than Ihave been. He is a distin-guished legislator and parliamentarian.He knows full well that this procedure isentirely in order and Iscertainlyin keep- ing with what I construe to be the properand normal process of dealing with legislatfon in this body.Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin. Mr. Chair-man, will the gentleman yield to me?Mr. COLLIER. I yield to the gentle-man from Wisconsin.Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin. Of course,this is done under the rule. The rule pro-vides that one motion to recommit shallIn order, and it is generally concededin the normal concept that a motion torecommit will be with instructions. Thereis no variation here at all.Mr. HAYS. Mr. Chairman, will thegentleman yield?Mr. COLLIER. I yield to the gentlemanfrom Ohio.Mr. HAYS. I may say the gentlemanstated when he began that he Is a firmsupporter of the bill, but he will offer amotion to recommit. Does that come Inthe rules?Mr. COLLIER. It will make me a muchfirmer supporter with the motion to re-commit adopted.Mr. COLMER. Mr. Chairman, will thegentleman yield to the gentlemanfrom Mississippi.Mr. COLMER. Yes. In reply to thestatement of the gentleman from Wis-consin and the gentleman from fllinoishimself, yes, it is in order, but it is thepurpose of this minimum amendment\u2014and I do not want to use the word \"gim-mick\"\u2014to be a way of preventing an out-right vote on the matter.Mr. COLLIER. I would have to dis-agree. On the other hand, I would con-strue it to be a method to provide themeans by which Members who want tosupport this and who believe in the con-cept and principle can do so by a clari-fication of the provision of the bill whichhas caused them difficulty.Mr. LANDRUM. Mr. Chairman, will thegentleman yield?Mr. COLLIER. I am happy to yield tothe gentleman.The CHAIRMAN. The time of the gen-tleman has expired.Mr. MIL&.$. Mr. Chairman, I yield suchtime as he may use to the gentleman fromMichigan (Mr. CONYERS).(Mr. CONYERS asked and was givenpermission to revise and extend his re-marks.)Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I riseat this time because we believe our taskis larger. Over the course of this debateno one has quarreled with the fact thatthe present system of welfare payjnentaneeds revision. We now will considerchanges in that system when we vote ciiHouse Resolution 16311, the Family As-sistance Aot of 1970. This bill, embody-ing President Nixon's welfare reformpackage, Is purported to be a progressiveand drastically different approach tomeeting the crisis of poverty In America.We appreciate the signlflance of theproposal and the progress tlt would bemade in reforming the present welfaresystem. However, if we vote for thismeasure it will be while fully recognizingthat It falls far short of what Is needed.The basic annual Federal allowanceproposed for a family of four is grosslyInadequate. This Federal payment willraiseassistancelevelsin only eightStates. Of all those who would receivepayments under the plan, the Depart-ment of Health, Education, and Welfarereports that the incomes of only 301,000families would be effectively raised abo'ethe poverty level. Is this really fightingpoverty? Furthermore, nowhere In theFamily Assistance Act is there a provi-sion that would even raise gradually thepayment levels to the poverty level, muchless to a minimum adequate level.We believe our commitment must belarger and more immediate. As a neces-sary first step we advocate that Congressset an adequate level of income for everyAmerican as a goal to be attained in thenear future. Only in this way can theGovernment have a standard by which to.realistically measure the problem andour progress toward its resolution. Anadequate living income is required toguarantee the basic right of every hu-man being\u2014the right to life\u2014a neces-sary precondition to all other constitu-tional, civil, and human rights. A majorshortcoming of the President's cate- gorical assistance plan is that it departs little from the social theories be-hind present welfare programs. We be-lieve, on the other hand, that the Gov-ernment of the richest nation on earthmust insure a living income for everyAmerican as a basic right. Only such arestructuring of the basic premises ofpublic assistance will yield a programthat will meet the real needs of the poorand achieve the goals desired by Con-gress.We do not believe that mandatorytraining and work requirements are theway to develop self-supporting Independ-ence in assistance recipients. To breakthe cycle of poverty, we must not onlyencourage meaningful employment butfoster human dignity as well. The FamilyAssistance Act, which substitutes coer-cion in place of work incentives, will in-evitably prove counter-productive. Webelieve mothers should be free to decidefor themselves whether or not to leavetheir children and take a job or enter jobtraining. Even so, to require job trainingthat will lead to meaningful employmentis one thing, but if there is no job guar-antee at the end of the' line it Is anothercruel hoax designed to placate critics ofpayments to the poor. Although HouseResolution 16311 has been called a viable\"workfare\" plan, there has been no pro-gram for full employment instituted oreven envisioned by the Federal Govern-ment. We believe the Government shouldsupplement its public assistanee pro-grains with public service employment.The immense and tragic proportions ofpoverty in America necessitates that wein Congress recognize the problem in Itsfull dimension. We believe that our ef-forts now must be greater, our will moremanifest, if ever we are to conquer it.The challenge we must accept is pro-viding the strength and direction to cre-ate for each American adequate condi-tions in which to live and develop andso to become a fully contributing mem- H 3182 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEApril 16,1970ber ofour society.

Mr. Chair-man, I spoke at length yesterday and Iam very grateful for the considerationgiven to me on that occasion by theMembers of the House. I do not intendto take comparable time on this occa-sion.However, let me say that I feel It myobligation c iniicate my full supportfor this legislatln. I honestly believethat the House has a unique opportunitytoday to make a major and long-overduereform in our welfare system.Seldom, in my 21 years In the Househave I seen an atmosphere exist whereyou could find the high degree of una-nimity from those on the left of the po-litical spectrum and those on the rightof the political spectrum who all agreeon the need for change which means Inthis case that the existing welfare sys-tem needs to be totally abandoned.I have yet to find a person in this bodyor a person in any one of the manyplaces where I have spoken who defendsthe existing welfare system, not one per-son to my knowledge has risen to speakup on behalf of the present welfare pro-gram.Mr. ALBERT. Mr. Chairman, will thegentleman yield?Mr. GERALD R. FORD. I yield tothe gentleman from Oklahoma.Mr. ALBERT. Mr. Chairman, I pridemyself in agreeing with what the gentle-man from Michigan is now saying. Iknow there are problems with the pres-ent system. The bill before us today maynot be perfect, but an overwhelmingnumber of those members who serve onthe committee that has had the respon-sibility for this matter have reported itout and have recommended it to theHouse as being better than the exist-ing system.Mr. Chairman, I associate myself withthe remarks of the distinguished minor-ity leader is making at this time.Mr. GERALD R. FORD. I appreciatethe observation and endorsement statedby the gentleman from Oklahoma, thedistinguished majority leader.Mr. Chairman, as I was saying, we inthis Congress today have a unique op-portunity. We have near unanimity..Those on the extreme on the left andthose on the extreme on the right allagree that we cannot defend the exist-ing system. The existing system has beenIn existence for several decades, probablythree, but it has been developed by patch-work. The net result has been that oureverlasting tinkering has brought us acolossus that has to be scratched andwhen you scratch something, you haveto begin with a totally new program. Thatwas th.e condition faced by the newPresident when he took office 15 monthsago. As a consequence, the President hasrecommended to the Congress a brandnew approach to the problem of welfare.I was honored, among many, to intro-duce that bill. I think that legislation issound and constructive. It will open newpaths to better solutions to the problemswe want to solve.I am delighted that the distinguishedchairman of this committee has seen fitto recommend wholeheartedly this leg-islation.I have talked to the President of theUnited States on a number of occasionsabout this legislation. As a matter offact, I talked to him today about it. ThePresident of the United States urged meto urge all of you as Republicans, par-ticularly, to vote for this legislation. Ihope that we can have on our side anoverwhelming vote on behalf of the leg-islation.I think it is unique that there is suchstrong bipartisan support for this far-reaching legislation. All of us can takecredit for opening new doors to the solu-tion of the difficult problem of welfareIn America.I simply want to state, Mr. Chairman,that if we pass this bill with the motionto recommit, I think the legislation willprobably represent one of the finest leg-islative proposals that has come to thefloor of the House during my term ofservice. It is my further opinion that wecan all take credit for trying to solvethe problem for the future which hasbeen unsolvable up to date.I urge as strongly as I can that allMembers support the motion to recom-mit. It improves the legislation. Andwhen that motion to recommit is ap-proved, as I hope it will be, I trust thaton our side of the aisle we will do every-thing we can, by our individual vote, tosupportthebasiclegislationrecom- mended by the President so that we cando the kind of a job that is needed andnecessary for the problem of welfare InAmerica.Mr. MOORHEAD. Mr. Chairman, Irise to express disappointment in theFamily Assistance Act of 1970, because itfalls so far short pf meeting the trueneeds of the people.We have waited a long time for mean-ingful change in our welfare system, andit is a delusion to think that the Presi-dent's welfare package even comes closeto meeting the problem.At a time when billions are being spentin our military budget, in heavy sub-sidies to special interest groups, whenthe President Is asking for more moneyfor a supersonic transport, I am appalledat the scant heed paid to the realisticneeds of the poor. We do have the re-sources to meet the social challenges inthis country; it Is tragic to realize thatour priorities are so misplaced.As this bill comes to us under a closedrule, permitting no amendments, thoseof us who have serious reservations aboutthe bill\u2014and yet do not want to totallyreject its limited structural Improve-ments\u2014simply must take this opportu-nity to speak out.I have therefore endorsed the state-ments of my colleagues, the gentlemanfrom Michigan (Mr. CONYERS), and thegentleman from California (Mr. BUR-TON) who have also asked for a largercommitment to meet this challenge, andI would ask that my colleagues here andIn the Senate seriously consider the rec-ommendations of the National WelfareRights Organization, and those of theCommittee for Economic Development,and work toward a bill that will be amore realistic response to the problem,and that will offer true reform to thepeople commensurate with their dignityand self-determination.Mr. Chairman, permit me to mentionsome of the recommendations of the Na-tionalWelfareRightsOrganizationwhich merit our consideration:The concept of guaranteed incomebased on \"need.\" They have requested a\"floor\" of $5,500 a year, which is the fig-ure determined by the U.S. Bureau ofLabor Statistics as the amount reallyneeded for, a family of four \"just to getby.\" And with this, provisions for an au-tomatic cost-of-living increase.The request that jobs should be guar-anteed first, so that job training will leadto meaningful employment and that pub-lic assistance programs be supplementedwith public service employment.The suggestion of an \"emergency fund\"for special needs, and a \"startup\" grantfor those just being enrolled.Further recommendations of the Com-mittee for Economic Development, theresearch policy arm of the Urban ActionCouncil, headed by former Secretary ofHealth, Education, and Welfare JohnGardner endorse these principles and alsorecommend:A phased takeover of State and localwelfare costs during the next 5 years bythe Federal Government.The Inclusion ofthe poor Workingsingle person and working childless cou-ple who are not covered in this legisla-tion.A Federal program to assist in the con-struction of .day care centers and to sup-port fully the programs of day carecenters enabling more mothers to work.Mr. Chairman, because the bill doesnot touch on these provisions Is why I saythe Nixon package is a delusion and adisappointment. The only reason to sup-port it is to create a vehicle to whichtrue reform can be attached.I include at this point In the RECORDfor the urgent consideration of my col-leagues a summary of the proposals ofthe National Welfare Rights Organiza-tion. These are proposals which this Con-gress should enact:NATIONALWELFAI%ERIGHTSOROANZZATXONPROPOSALS FOR AN ADEQUATE INCOMEThe National Weirare Rights Organizationis a nationwide grassroots organization ofwelfare recipients and. other poor people. Ithas 350 affiliates in 48 states and more than150 cities. NWRO is launching a nationwidecampaign for an adequate ftzcome for everyAmerican citizen. NWRO is challenging thecountry to change ttspriorities from anemphasis on death and destruction to anemphasis on Ufe and peace. We believe thatevery man, woman, and ohild has the right. April 16,1970tolive: We call upon our country to beginsubsidizing life!We believe a minimum adequate incomefor a family of four is $5500. This figure isderived from data collected in surveys con-ducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics ofthe U.S. Department of Labor, which showhow much families of four actually spend tolive at a lower standard. We call upon theFederalGovernmenttoguaranteeevery American this minimum income.Our planincludesthefollowingfea- tures:The income should be automatically ad-justed for variations in size of family, costsof living in various parts of the country, andchanges in cost-of-living and median fam-ily income as they occur.Eligibility should be based solely on need,and should be based on a person's declara-tion of what his needs are, with spot checksas is done under our income tax system.The system should provide a work Incen-tive by permitting recipients to keep of their earnings.Recipients should be entitled to a fairhearing prior to the termination or reduc-tion of benefits. The hearing should takeplace within fifteen (15) days of the applica-tion for appeal. Special grants should be pro-vided for recipients to obtain lawyers or otheradvocates.The regulations pertaining to rights andentitlements under this system should bepublicInformation,Simplifiedversions should be distributed to every receipient andpotential recipient.Persons eligible for these benefits shouldbe entitled to free medical care, legal serv-ices, and day care facilities of a high qualityin the neighborhoods where they live.Other services to the recipients should beon a completely voluntary basis, adminis-tered by agencies separate from those ad-ministering the guaranteed income pay-ments. Example of these are: family plan-ning, homemaker services, family counsel-ing, child welfare, etc.Special grants should be available to takecare of all emergency or unusual situations.These would Include grants for clothing andfurniture to bring the recipient's householdup to minimum standardS of health anddecency at the time they come under theprogram. Replacement costs would be pro-vided in case or fire, flood, or substantialchange in circumstance.A recipient should have the right to choosebetween a flat grant or an itemized assess-ment of his needs, taking into account ac-tual cost of housing, transportation, cloth-ing. and other special requirements he mighthave. This would \\be similar to the Incometax system where an individual may eitheritemize his deductions or take a standarddeduction, depending on which method ofbenefits suits him more.TABLEI.\u2014NWRO PROPOSED ADEQUATE INCOME DETAILEDBUDGET FOR FAMILY OF FOUR Cost per\u2014Category YearMonthWeek FOOD HOUSINGThese costs represent the BLSlower standard's costs, updatedto spring 1969 levels.

The range runs from$5209 in most non-metropolitan areas to$6649 for Honolulu. The budget for severalcities are estimated in Table 2.The NWRO budget has been updated toSpring 1969 prIces. Inflation has caused a9.4% increase in. the cost of living since BLScomputed the cost of living In 1967.The importance of continued recognitionof special needs and of providing alternateways of meeting needs, either through theadequate income (flat grant) or through in-dividualconsideration(computations),is important for two reasons:1. BLS assumed in establishing the budgetthat the family had been established forfifteen (15) years and had an accumulatedstock of clothing and furniture. The budgetwas intended only to cover replacements.This assumption does not apply to the aver-age family in poverty. This is why we areasking for special grants for wardrobe andfurnishings to bring persons up to minimumstandards for health and decency.2. The budget is based on statistical aver-aging formulas which do not necessarily op.ply to real people or real situations. For ex-ample, an individual family of four may ormay not be able to obtain adequate housingin good condition at the $92 a month rentthat the budget allows, even if that happensto be the average for the city in which helives.Similar arguments can be applied to trans-portationcosts, where the transportationquantity for school children in the BL8budgetwaslessthanthenumberof days in the school year! Thia is because itwas an average amount children who rode toschool and those who walked. It can be as-sumed that some families would be over inone category and under in another. Thesestatistical differences may not always averageout in any given family. If a family hasgreater need In a number of categories, theyshould have the option of itemizing theirfamily budget, and applying for a grant thatmeets the actual needs that they have.Table3givesthe minimum adequacybudget for various family sizes.TABLE111.\u2014MINIMUMADEQUATEBUDGET\u2014ADJUSTEDBUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS BUDGET' BY, FAMILY SIZE Family 45$2,0003,50045005,5006,500$167292375458542$386787106125CONGRESSIONAL OF CITIES' $15 The items in this budget, shampoo $784$65 and yard goods as well as cloth-ing and Clothing care are un-changed from the BLS lowerstandard.

There isno provision, according tothe BLS study for COMES FROMTable 1 outlines the adequate income pro-p3sal. Itis based on the Bureau of LaborStatistics \"Lower Living Standard Budget\".This is the Labor Department's \"lower stand-ard for the maintenance of health and so-cial well being, the nurture of children andparticipation in community activities.\"We reject the income level in the NixonFamily Assistance Plan. At worst it allowsa family of four $1600 a year. At best it wouldcontinue the present inadequate welfare sys-tem. The ceiling of benefits would be at thePoverty Line, now $3720 a year for a fasnilyof four.The poverty line is based on the U.S. De-partmentofAgriculture's Economy FoodPlan which,. according to the AgricultureDepartment, \"is not a reasonable measure ofbasic money needs for a good diet.\" USDApoints out that \"the public assistance agencythat recognizes the limitations of its clien-tele and is interested in their nutritionalwell-being will recommend a money allow-ance for food considerably higher than thecost level of the Economy Plan.\"Under the Nixon Plan, states will have noincentive to raise grants above this level,The Economy Food plan used in the pov-erty line and the Nixon bill allows a personto survive, according to the Department ofAgriculture, with adequate nutrition \"forshort emergency periods of time and onlyunder very special circumstances.\"The so-called \"low income poverty line\"is based on the USDA's food plan.\"It sets an income of approximately $4650 ayear for a family of four. Government sur-veys show, however, that only one fourth(1/,,) of the families with food budgets equiv-alent to the low-cost food plan actually havenutritionally adequate diets.The NWRO adequate income budget, there-fore. uses the USDA \"moderate food plan\"$186$43which would insure the average family anadequate diet. NWRO contends that provid-ing adequate income is the only sure wayto combatting hunger in America.The adjusted budget excludes the basiccosts of hospital and doctorscare since it isassumed that free medical care would beavailable through national health insurance27or Medicaid or some other program. It shouldalso be noted that this budget includes nomoney for cigarettes (regarded by BLS as ahealth hazard), non-prescription drugs ormedical supplies, out-of-town travel, long-distance telephone calls, dry cleaning, or useof a laundromat.This allowance Is a total of the $2, 237 BLS moderate budget cost schoollunches, etc. 1,402117 H3184I Family of four budget computed from the Bureau of LaborStatistics lower standard budget and as described in the text.Budgets for other family sizes are designed to provide adequateincome and prevent families from breaking up.Note: $1,000 per year tsr each additional family member.Under the NWRO wsrk incentive a family of four will receivebenefits up to $10,000 ifit receives earned income.HUNGERThe elimination of hunger In the UnitedStates requires that every citizen be as-sured an adequate income. Poor people knowbetter than anyone else that the hodge-podgeof programs set up by the Department ofAgriculture are welfare programs for fai'1ers and the food processing and distributionIndustry. They are not designed to serve theneeds of poor people. Welfare programs whichexclude people for reasons other than needand which do not provide adequate incomeare a basic source of hunger and malnutri-tion.The Nixon Plan claims that the food stampprogram will add about $800 to recipients an-nual budgets but only about 38% of welfarerecipients currently receive stamps accord-ing to an Agriculture Department Reportdated January, 1970. RecIpients cannot af-ford to participate in the program becausethe stamps are not free. In the winter thismeans a recipient has to postpone buyingwarm clothing of paying a heating bill in 2. higher Federal income floors: The billshould provide a federally guaranteed in-come floor closer to the $5500 standard. Foodstamp allotments could be converted towardraising the cash floor.3. Time table to reach adequate income:The bill should provide a time table forreaching the adequate standard at the earli-est possible date.4. Emergency grants: The bill should pro-vide for emergency grants to take care ofspecial or unusual situations that poor peo-pie have because of the conditions they areforced to live in.5. Cost of living adjustments: The billshould require annual cost of living adjust-ments for all federal or federally regulatedassistanceprograms.Itshouldprohibit states form eliminating special grant pro-grams when this would have the effect ofcircumventing cost of living adjustments.State supplements must be based on statepayment levels which reflect required costof living adjustments as mandated by Sec-tion 402a) (23) of the 1967 amendments.6. Broadened coverage: Coverage shouldbe extended to all persons (including singlepersons, childless couples and elderly per-sons)whose requirements fall below thebenefit level.7. Simple Federal administration: The billshould provide direct, unitifled federal ad-ministrationforallprogramsincluding aged, disabled and blind.8. No forced work for mothers: All moth-ers must be exempted from requirements toaccept work or training programs. The rightto day care and the mother as judge of ade-quate day care should also be made clear.9. Job standards: Work requirements formen must be regulated by strict nationalCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEorder to buy food stamps. While the programis \"voluntary\" recipients are frequently madeto feel obliged to buy food stamps.The surplus commodity program cannotprovide enough of the right kind of food andis operated so cumbersomely that recipientsmust queue up at a specified time and placeor lose their food until the following month.Both these programs brand recipients aspoor people giving them bits of colored paperor marked items that single them out fromother people. The best food program is money.The solution to the problem of hungerand malnutrition is for every citizen to beguaranteed an adequate income to meet hisbasic food and other needs. Therefore, themoney directed toward giving bonuses infood stamps could better be redirected towardproviding a more adequate basic income forpoor people.WELFARE REFORMMuch has been said and written about theinadequacies of our present welfare system.Much has been said about the Inadequaciesof the President's so-called welfare reform.As we press toward an adequate income muchcan be done to improve the welfare systemand the Nixon Plan NOW!1. Adequate income goals: The bill shouldset an adequae income goal based upon theNWRO $5500 standard. standards Including minimum wage protec-tion and fair labor standards at least equiva-lent to those used in unemployment insur-ance. First priority for jobs and trainingshould be given to all those who volunteer.10. Rights of recipients: Recipients mustbe given a clear explanation of their rightsunder the program. Recipient organizationsmust be recognized as parties in legal actionand be given copies of all regulations andprocedures issued under the Act.Mr. BENNETr. Mr. Chairman, it hasbeen repeatedly said here that today'sexisting welfare program Is heavily criti-cized. This is true. But most of the criti-cism is that the present program is tooexpensive; and further that It benefitspeople who will not work, who are ableto work.On the first point, not even the mostardent supporters here have suggestedthat the legislation will cost less than thepresent program. The official report onthe bill Indicates, at page 43, that thecost will be at least $4.44,llllon more thanthe present program, on an annual basis.Authorities have suggested that the in-crease in cqsts is probably nearer $10billion a year; and one has suggested afigure of $14 billion additional each year.Even the most ardent friends of the billadmit that its passage will require in-creased Federal Income taxes.On the second point of criticism of thepresent welfare program, the prospect ofthe legislation before us is not all bright,nor all gloom. On the bright side, It willApril 16,1970not require a man to leave his family toget welfare benefits; and that shouldprovide a beneficial thrust toward hold-ing families together. Yet, it has beenacknowledged repeatedly in this debatethat there is also a thrust in the oppositedirection, by this legislation toward split-ting families because of the permissionunder this legislation for a family to splititself in two and then draw full benefitsas two separate families. Tothis extentthe bill would provide a financial incen-tive for families to split. The legislationwould also seem to give a financial incen-tive for a single man of low income tomarry and beget children for this wouldprovide him a Federal check not other-wise available, whether he was ever em-ployed before or after establishing afamily.The greatest weakness of this legis-lationisthat ittends to equate jobtraining with job placement. There isnothing in the bill that would requireanyone to work in fact; and It certainlycannot be termed a job producing typeof legislation. H.R. 112, introduced by meon January 3, 1969, and referred to theWays and Means Committee would pro-duce the type of jobs that are neededamong poor people today. It would pro-vide a tRx incentive for employers, hirepersons among the hard-core unem-ployed. I have introduced another billwhich seems to me to offer better answersthan the legislation before us today, andat a much smaller cost. I refer to HR.13081,Introduced on July 24, 1969, andreferred to the Committee on Ways andMeans.I appeared before that committee onOctober 21, 1969, and In my testimonyfor that bill I summarized as follows:Finally, H.R. 13081 would encourage em-ployment among the needy and provide jobopportunities. Most people would prefer doingconstructive work to being on relief andmy bill helps in two ways. First. It providesthat any individual receiving welfare assist-ance, financed in part with Federal fundsunder the Social Security Act shall not, be-cause of earned income, have his welfare pay-ments reduced by a greater percentage than$1 reduction for every $2 earned. Secondly,the bill authorizes the Secretary of Labor tocreate a register of individuals who have notbeen successful in finding employment. Cityand State governments and Federal depart-ments and agencies would have the right topetition the Secretary of Labor for manpowerfromthis pool. The Federal Governmentwould in each case pay the minimum hourlywage for the work done.It has been several times said here bymembers of the ,,pommittee that Con-gressrnen have not come forth with bet-ter suggestions than the bill before us.I think I have done so; and I think suchremarks coming from the committee arenot very persuasive in view of their re-quest and attainment of a rule whichprecluded even the tiniest of amend-ments.Mr. BEVILL. Mr. Chairman, I havefollowed the debate of the past 2 dayson H.R. 16311, The Family AssistanceAct of 1970, with great interest. Thedistinguished chairman of the Ways andMeans Committee has, as usual, de-veloped some very strong arguments infavor of this legislation.I agree with the Members who haveCOMPARISON FOOD BUDGETS\u2014FAMILY OF 4\u2014JUNE 1969 basedthisAnnualbudgetPer yearPer monthPer weekBudgetonfood plan for plan USDA moderate food plan USDA low cost food plan USDA economy food plan Food Stamp programAFDC allowance for food$2,288 1,778 1,300 1,272820$191 148 108 10668$44 34 25 2416BLS moderate standard $7,813budget.NWRO minimum adequacy stamp recipientsAFDC average State budget... 2,460 April 16,1970arguedfor reforms in our present wel-fare system. Without question, theremust be change. But while this bill of-fersa numberofhighlydesirablechanges, I have some very serious re-servations about the guaranteed incomeprovision.I am concerned that the institution ofa guaranteed income may open the flood-gates to revolutionary innovations whichcould all but break the back of the al-ready overburdened American taxpayer.It is my understanding, Mr. Chairman,that this legislation would add at least15 million new people to the welfare rolls,at a cost of at least $4'/2billiona year.This is at the beginning. The programis sure to grow and cost more.While I favor the overall thrust ofthe bill, namely to provide beneflt,s tofamilies in need in a manner that willencourage employment and family sta-bility, I question whether H.R. 16311 willaccomplish this.Independence and self-sufficiency havelong been the hallmark of the Americanfamily. Guaranteed handouts from theGovernment can only undermine themotivation of young people who arereared under these conditions.I agree with my distinguished col-league from Georgia, (Mr. LANDRUM) thatthis bill puts the benefits in this order:Cash, food, and work.What we need to do is turn this aroundand put work first and cash last.Mr. Chairman, I cannot, in good con-science, vote to levy additional taxes onthe American taxpayerinorderto guarantee an income to any person whosimply will not work. And I am afraidthat is what would happen if we passedthis bill in its present form.I submit, Mr. Chairman, that this billis too far reaching, too revolutionary,and must be modified. I would like tosee some of the provisions become law.But I favor striking out the guaranteedincome provision.In my judgment, what this countryneeds most at this time is a reductionin spending and an intensive effort bythe administrationto lower interestrates.Mr. HANSEN of Idaho. Mr. Chair-man, I rise to call the attention of mycolleagues to the child care provisionsof the Family Assistance Act of 1970.There is a growing awareness of theneedto provide child care services as a meansof encouraging mothers of small chil-dren who can and want to work to movefrom the welfare rolls into productiveemployment. There isalso a growingrecognition of the value of providing awholesome atmosphere to stimulate thechild's physical, emotional, and intel-lectual growth and development.The Select Education Subcommitteeunder the chairmanship of the gentle-man from Indiana (Mr. BRADEMAS) hasconcluded lengthy public hearings onchild development legislation. I am con- fident that we will soon report a bill thatwill be the product of an effective bipar-tisan commitment to provide servicesthat 'are truly responsive to the needs ofchildren in the preschool years. This willbe landmark legislation in every sense of the word. The services to children pro-CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014HOUSEvided in this bill will supplement andcomplement the services provided in theFamily Assistance Act.Mr. Chairman, in order to answer somequestions the Members of the House mayhave concerning the operation of thispart of the bill before us, I include as apart of my remarks a series of questionsand answers furnished to me at my re-quest by the Office of Child Developmentof the Department of Health, Education,and Welfare:QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON THE CHILD CAREPROVISIONS OF THE FAMILY ASSISTANCE Ac,rOF 19701. Question: What are child care services?Answer: Child care services include thefunding of care for the child In his ownhome, in a family day care program, or ina group day care program. It includes careboth for preschool children and for school-age children during the summer, on schoolholidays and before and after regular schoolhours. HEW would propose to limit suchcare to children under the age of 15 exceptin special circumstances when an older childrequires protective care(i.e., mentally re-tarded children, or handicapped children).There would be no minimum age limit. Thelength of program for a child will depend onthe needs of the parent\u2014it may be Only afew hours a day or as long as 10 to 12 hoursa day\u2014It may be provided during night timehours as well as during the day. Child careservices aim to provide activities that con-tributetoward theintellectual,physical. social and emotional growth and develop-ment of the child.2. Question: Who iseligible to receivechild care services?Answer: Child care services may be pro-vided for the following families:(a) Those which have registered for em-ployment or training under the provisions ofPart D of Title IV as added by the FamilyAssistance Act.(b)Those which are receiving supple-mentary financial payments from a state pur-suant to Part E of Title IV as added by theFamily Asssitance Act.(C)Thosewhich had formerly receivedbenefits under Part D or Part E.(d) Those with an adult family memberreferred pursuant to Section 447(d) of theAct to participate in vocational rehabilita-tion.(e) Those which are receiving AFDC pay-ments prior to the date when Part D be-comes effective for a state.In each case, the family is eligible only ifthe purpose for providing child care is tobetter enable an adult family member toengage in training, to take employment, tocontinue employment or to participate invocational rehabilitation. HEW would in-tend to permit continued child care for short periods of time if the parent is ill, seasonally unemployed, temporarily layedoff, or unemployed but actively looking forwork. The Secretary Is authorized to limitthe length of time which an individual maycontinue to receive child care after they areno longer eligible for benefits under Part Dor Part F.3. Question: Who may receive funds forchild care?Answer: Funds may be provided either inthe form of direct grants or contracts to anystate or local public agency or non-profit pri-vate agency or organization, (only contractsmay be arranged with a private-for-profitagency or Organization) or through grantsto any public or non-profit private agencywhichisdesignated by theappropriate elected or appointed official or officials inthe area. A capacity to work effectively withthe manpower agency Is required. HEW wouldpropose to establish criteria for use in de-H3185termining the competence of organizationsto carry out a child care program. Equal con-sideration would be given to all types ofagencies as operators of child care serviceprograms. HEW would give preference as toprime grantees to those organizations whicheither were themselves or were a part of co-ordinated efforts to deliver day care and pre-school services (for example, the CommunityCoordinatedChildCare\u20144-C--Program).This preference follows the philosophy of thestatutory provisions found in Title V\u2014B ofthe Economic Opportunity Act which man-dates the Secretary and the Director of theOffice of Economic Opportunity to establishmechanisms for coordination at the locallevel. On the other hand, the absence of acoordinating mechanism would not be a. barto funding public or private agencies.Grants could be made to employers, laborunions or combinations thereof. HEW wouldconsider them as eligible grantees but wouldnot give them preference over other publicand private agencies.Child care funds could not be given di-rectly to individuals. It would, however, bepossible to give grants or contracts to an in-termediary organization which would providean intake and referral service to parents as-sisting them in selecting among the manyexisting child care services In a community.In such cases the Intermediary organiza-tion would then provide child care throughthe issuance of a voucher to, or the makingof payments on behalf of the parents, to theservice provider.4. Question: What may be funded as apart of child care services?Funds may be provided to carry out aprogram of daily activities, to provide trans-portation, to provide food for use In the pro-gram, to provide necessary supplies and ma-terials, and to provide for medical and den-tal examinations and for referral and followthrough with health care agencies. Treat-ment costs may be funded in the absence ofother funds to provide for remedial healthcare and where it is determined that the ab-sence of such care will adversely affect theability of the child to participate in the pro-gram. Funds may be provided for all person-nel costs and for the training of personnel.Funds may be provided for administrativecosts necessary for operation of the program.Funds are also available for alterations tobuildings, remodeling and for renovation.Funds are available for rent. Funds are NOTavailable for new construction,HEW would plan to apply the standardsdeveloped under Title V\u2014B of the EconomicOpportunity Act (Federal Interagency DayCare Requirements) to the funding of pro-grams under the Family Assistance Act. Thisis consistent with the requirements of TitleV\u2014B of the Economic Opportunity Act thatstandards be as uniform as possible amongday care program.5. Question: What proportion of total costwill HEW pay?Answer: The Federal Government will payup to 100 percent of the total cost of childcare programs.6. Question: Are families required to paya portion of the cost of day care?Answer: The law authorizes the Secretaryto require families to pay for part or all ofthe costs of services in such amounts as maybe reasonable in light of the family's ability.HEW would propose that no fees be chargedwhen the individual is in a training statusor in his first three months of employment.A sliding scale of payments would be devel-oped for those individuals who have enteredInto emplorment. This eliding scale wouldtake Into account the relationship betweenincome and family size. It would permit rec-ognition of special factors such as unusualmedical expenses which make it difficult fora family to pay for day care. The costs whichthe family pays itself are excluded fromtheir Income in calculating their eligibility H3186for assistance under the Family AssistanceProgram.7. Question: What role will the state gov-ernment play in the administration of theprogram?Answer: State agencies may be the granteefor child care funds in those situationswhere they are in the best position to providefor child care services. HEW will requirethat all child care programs meet the li-censing requirements of the states. HEW willcontract with state agencies to provide tech-nical assistance to grantees to help thelatter to meet licensing regulations. HEWwould also propose to use state agenciesunder technical assistance contracts to as-sist grantees to improve their programs.8. QuestIon: Will funds be available fortraining and technical assistance?Answer: There will be funds available fortraining andtechnicalassistance.These funds may be provided in the form ofgrants to any public or private (includingfor-profit)agencyororganization. HEWwould propose to use training funds for allcategories of personnel involved in the pro-vision of child care services; for career de-velopment in the case of nonprofessionals,and for graduate level training in the caseof those individuals-who have supervisory orleadership potential. HEW will also pro- pose to use these funds for the training ofevaluation and research personnel.9. Question: Are funds available for re-search or demonstrations?Answer: Funds are available for researchand demonstration projects to public andprivate(including for-profit)agencies or organizations. HEW would propose to coordi-nate research and demonstration fundingunder this authorization with research anddemonstration funds available under theHead Start program. Section 426 of the So-cial Security Act and other Federal author-izations administered by the Department.10. Question: When a family is requiredto pay a portion or all of the cost of childcare, may such cost be deducted from earnedincome?Answer: The Secretary may prescribe reg-ulations which permit a family to deduct allor part of such costs from earned income.HEW would propose that the full cost ofsuch care be deductible provided that thecosts do not exceed those which the FederalGovernment would finance under the Fed-eral Interagency Day Care Requirements.11. Question: How will grants be made?Answer: Agencies designated as applicantsfor child care grants will file an applicationwith the appropriate HEW Regional Officeof Child Development. Where a communityhas established coordination mechanisms,priority will be given to those applicationsfor operation of child care service programswhich have the approval of the coordinatingorganization. Where no coordinating agencyexists, grants will be made on the basis ofthe quality and cost of the program proposedby each applicant.12. Question: What do the words \"renova-tion\" and \"remodeling\" mean?Answer: The legislation gives no definitionof these terms. HEW would propose to givethem a very broad interpretation, but wouldexclude purchase of land or construction ofa new building. Minor additions to a build-ing which did not involve an increase of morethan 20 percent in the size of the buildingwould be included in the definition of reno-vation and remodeling.Remodeling andrenovation funds woulc be available for bothfamily and group day care facilities.13. QuestIon: How much money Is avail-able for child care services?Answer: The law authorizes appropriationof such funds as are necessary to carry outthe purposes of the Act. It also requires thatthe Secretary shall make provision for thefurnishing of child care services for co longas he deems appropriate to persons Who, pur-CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEsuant to registration under Section 447, areparticipating in manpower services, train-ing or employment. Funds are expected to beavailable in sufficient amounts to ensure thatchild care services are available to eligiblerecipients.14. Question: May the Secretary of Laborprovide day care services?Answer: The Secretary of Labor has au-thority to provide child care services in sup-port of manpower and training programs un-der his jurisdiction. However, he must ob-tain the concurrence of HEW with regardto policies to be used In administering suchchild care programs. HEW would recommendthat the Secretary of Labor provide childcareserviceonly Inexceptional circum-stances and that, in ruch cases, the FederalInteragency Day Care Requirements be fullyapplicable.15. Question: What will happen to daycare provided under the Work incentive Pro-gram?Answer: The Work Incentive Program willbe repealed at the time the new Family As-sistance Program becomes effective. Duringthe interim period, day care may be pro-vided under the Family Assistance Act in lieuof day care provided under the WIN pro-gram. The time at which this transition willbe made will depend upon the availabilityof appropriations.16. Question: What will happen to day carefunded under Parts A and B of Title IV othe Social Security Act?Answer: States may continue to fund daycare programs under Parts A and B of TitleIV subject to the policies and regulationspresently in effect. It wiil usually be financi-ally advantageous, of course, to provide suchcare under the Family Assistance Act ratherthan Title IV. There are, however, individ-uals who may not be eligible for services un-der the Family Assistance Act but who wouldqualify under the provisions of Title IV. Thiswould be particularly true in the case ofpotential recipients.Mr. FISHER. Mr. Chairman, I amopposed to the pending bill. It is beingprojected as a welfare reform measure,but in reality it would place 3 millionadditional families on welfare. A total of15 million would, in one fell swoop, beadded to the relief rolls.The claim is made that such benefici-aries would be expected to apply forwork, take job training if necessary, andaccept suitable employment. But thatrequirementisso riddled with loop-holes that in my judgment it is rathermeaningless.A highly objectionable provision wouldguarantee an annual income in the amount of $1,600, along with $800 peryear in food stamps, for families of four.Let us recognize this fact: Once thisconcept of a guaranteed annual incomeis given congressional approval, it wlUbecome a part of our welfare way of life.There will be no turning back. The pres-sures will be on to constantly Increasethe$1,600baseguarantee.Already the Americans for Democratic Action\u2014ADA\u2014is demanding $5,500, and so arethe professional welfare organizations.Now, what about the added cost, andwhere is the money coming from? Pro-ponents estimate that Initially the costwill increase by $4.4 billion, which isadmittedly conservative. We must beprepared for two or three times thatamount\u2014in addition to what welfare Isnow costing. Does this mean an increaseIn taxes to the tune of an additional$5 billion or $10 billion per year? If not,April 16,1970then what about the Inflation that willresult from deficit financing?Mr. Chairman, this administration billshould be defeated. Let us help the de-serving but let us deny any welfare tothose who are able bodied and refuse towork when employment is available.Mr. McCLOSKEY. Mr. Chairman, Ihave voted for H.R. 16311 today, theFamily Assistance Act, but with somereservations, and with a particular regretthat the closed rule did not permit us tooffer floor amendments.The most persuasive argument for thisbill is that it provides an incentive forpeople to get off the welfare rolls and outof poverty.I think the bill, however, also includesan indirect incentive to remain in pov-erty, that being its provision that theimpoverished family will be allocated anadditional $300 per year for every childthey bear.It has been recognized that high birthrates among the poor are not merelya result of poverty; they are also a causeof poverty. Reports by the Census Bureauand other organizations indicate thatpoor families have a disproportionatenumber ofchildrenrelativetothe resources at their disposal for raising andeducating those children in a mannerwhich would increase their chance formoving out of povty. Additional chil-dren can cause a nonpoor family to dropbelow the poverty level.It thus seems inappropriate in this billto pay an additional $300 per year foreach child an already impoverished f am-ily may have. It would be hard to concedethis is anything but an incentive to con-tinue bearing more children at a timewhen the Impact of our population ex-plosion is pushing us Into both high ex-penditures and urgent concern for slow-ing If not halting population growth.It was only a month ago that the Presi-dent signed into law the population com-mission bill, directing a study of appro-priate methods of achieving proper pop-ulation levels.Had an open rule been granted it wasmy intention to offer a general amend-ment to H.R. 16311 limiting the num-ber of children to be included as familymembers to those children born beforeDecember 31, 1971, and to no more thantwo such children born thereafter. Suchamendment would read as follows:Certaii Additional Children Ineligible(f) Notwithstanding any other provisionof this part or part E, no more than twochildren who are natural children of eitheror both of the parents in the family and whowere born after January 1, 1972. shall be in-cluded as members of the family for purposesof determining the family's benefits underSection 442 (a) or the amounts of such bene-fits under Section 442(b).In my judgment, Mr. Chairman, It Isessential that the U.S. Government makea firm declaration of national policythat family sizes will have to be voluntar-ily limited If we are to preserve our en-vironmental quality.With the dawning realization that un-limited population growth can destroyboth the environment and quality oflife on this planet, It seems of doubtfulwisdom to pass any law at this stageIn history which includes encouragement April 16, 1970for large families. It may be that afterthe new population commission has stud-ied the problem, it will recommend thatAmerican population can increase 1 or 2percent per year without endangeringour national goals and way of life. Ifso, we may then have the luxury of re-turning to government laissez-faire withrespect to family size. Recognizing, how-ever, that the children born today orwhich will be borne under the encour-agement of the bill before us, will havethe same inalienable rights to life, lib-berty, equal protection of the law and thepursuit of happiness that we do, it seemsworthwhile to suggest a moratorium untilwe have more knowledge on the questionas to how many people can survive com-fortably on this earth. I appreciate that my remarks do nOtaffect the passage of this bill under theclosed rule, but would like to recordmy position at this point in the RECORDin the hope that it will furnish a basisfor further reflection by the Congresson this point in the months ahead.Mr. DENNEY. Mr. Chairman, H.R.16311, the proposed Family AssistanceAct of 1910, is significant because it pro-poses\u2014for the first time in the history ofthis country\u2014that the Federal Govern-ment guarantee an income to Americanfamilies, regardless of their productiveabilities or inclinations. In addition tosubstituting the family assistance pro-gram for the present AFDC program, thisproposal would make substantial changesin three other existing Federal-Stateprograms\u2014aid to the aged, aid to theblind, and aid to the permanently dis-abled. These three programs would becombined into a single adult assistanceprogram.The Ways and Means Committee re-port on H.R. 16311, indicates that if thefamily assistance plan had been in effectin calendar 1968, the Federal costs ofbenefits payments would have been $3billion greater than the cost of the exist-ing AFDC program. Even though H.R.16311 would still require large expendi-tures of State funds, the bill would leavevery little State or local control over wel-fare programs.Americans long ago accepted the Ideaof helping those who truly need help andcannot help themselves. But, we havenot as yet ever endorsed the Idea thatthe Government should pay welfare tothose already working. Once this prin-ciple is established in law, the only dis-tinction between those who pay taxesand those who claim them is some ar-bitrary, -Government decreed income level. And as this level is raised, propor-tionally fewer and fewer people will bepaying higher taxes to support more andmore welfare recipients. It is argued thata.nationwideFederal minimum willeliminate the present differentials in AFDC payments and curb the incentiveto migrate to those States which providelarger payments. In my opinion, the pro-. posed Federal minimum will not elimi-nate these differentials, but the objectiveis unsound anyway because availablestudi\u00e7s show that the growth in AFDCin certain States was not caused by a large migration of people just to get on welfare. So. contrary to popular belief,CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014HOUSEthe facts show that better welfare bene-fitshave not caused migration and,therefore, this is not a valid basis forcreating a Federal minimum standard.Even granting the merits of the pro-posal, the Federal budget is not in shapeto accommodate the cost of this newlegislation, And it Is seriously questionedwhether the budgets of future years willbe able to meet the rising costs of thiswelfare expansion program. The pro-posed budget for 1971 is extremely tight.It appears to me that unless we are willing to tolerate another wave of infla-tionary deficit spending, some additionaltaxation will be inevitable.The objectives of the provisions re-lating to those unable to support them-selves through their own efforts\u2014theaged, the blind, and the completely dis-abled\u2014are reasonable and sound. Meet-ing their needs is a responsibility of all\u2014and financingthecostsshould beshared by all taxpayers through theFederal, State, and local government.A constructive approach would be topass legislation that will help those whoneed it most. There is justification forimproving welfare aid for the aged, theblind, and disabled, and the familieswithdependentchildren,wherethe father is either unemployed or absent.And also for providing occupational re- habilitation for those who are able tobenefit from it. Congress could accom-plish this by eliminating that part ofH.R. 16311 which authorizes a guaran- teed income for families with workingfathers. That would direct help wherethe help is needed.Mr. TUNNEY. Mr. Chairman, it is in-deed a tragedy that in this country ofaffluence that theirstillexist in ourmidst over 45 millions persons living be-low or near poverty conditions. Yet it isa greater tragedy that the legislaturesin our Nation have not been able to pro- duce an adequate welfare program thatcan deal constructively with the prob-lems of our poor.It is obviously that the existing wel-fare program has failed miserably in itsintended goal of reducing the numberson welfare rolls and putting such recip-ients successfully back into the laborforce. The participation rate in AFDCis rapidly increasing, and if costs rise atthe present rate they will have doubledby 1975. This is indicated by the factthat in the last 15 years the number ofchildrenreceiving assistance has in-creased 100 percent\u2014from 30 per thou-sand in the population to 60 per thou-sand.The AFDC has also failed in its basicsystem of paying bonuses to families thatbreak apart. The existing program prin-cipally aids female-headed families withno provisions to assist families headedby fathers working full time for sub-standard wages.There are also in this program Un-justifiableinequitiesamongvarious States and regions in our country. Re-flective of this is the huge discrepancybetween the lowest funding for a female-headed family of four\u2014being $45 permonth\u2014and the highest benefits\u2014$263per month.Another of the present systemH 3187is seen in its built-in incentives to en- courage a person to actually quit work.One of its major requirements is that thefamily have no working male head. Inlight of the rapid growth of participa-tion rate and cost, encouragement offamily break-up, State inequities, andthe negative approach toward work, Ifeel there is an immediate necessity forthe passage of this welfare reform bill.Although there are definite and severeinadequacies in the proposal I find it anecessary and progressive move towarda workable solution to present welfareproblems.The proposed major accomplishmentsof the family assistance plan would blendstrong work requirements with firm workincentive. It would treat the female headof the family on an equal footing withthe male. Furthermore, there would beestablished a national minimum pay-ment combined with national eligibilitystandards as well as major fiscal relieffor the States. Of prime importance tothe bill is the planned major expansionin job training and child care facilitiesfor the working poor. Additionally, thebill proposes an increased national mini-mum payment to the aged, blind, anddisabled.The family, under this program, wouldreceive assistance benefits in the form ofFederal payments. This would include allfamilies with children having an earn-ing ceiling of $3,920, for a family offour, and most importantly this wouldinclude the working poor. To facilitatethe Federal funding there would be es-tablished nationwide uniform eligibilitystandards. Most able-bodied adults wouldbe required to participate in work regis-tration or lose benefits, The family withno earnings would receive $500 for eachof the first two members and $300 foreach additional member thereafter. Thefamily earning an income would have noreductions of benefits for their first $720and 50 cents off benefits for each addi-tional dollar earned. This would be animprovement over the present system, asit would include more working heads offamilies in need who could possibly be-come self-sufficient.The States would be required to sup-plement Federal assistance benefits upto the AFDC payment levels, or povertylevel\u2014whichever would be lower. Thereis no supplementation of the workingpoor required, and Federal matchingwould provide for 30 percent of the Statepayments up to the poverty level. Underthe current system there exists a hugeburden on the States and this reformproposal encourages a more fully fed-eralized system of funding which liftssome of the burden from the States, whoare so often unable to provide adequatebenefits.Of prime Importance in this bill is theincreased attention given to the aged,blind, and disabled. The bill proposes torequire the States to assure a minimumincome of $110 per person each month.In addition there would be Federalmatching of 90 percent of the first $65of the average benefits, and 25 percentof amounts above that. Because theseproposals would be combined with na-tional eligibility standards as well as re-sources ceilings and earnings Incentives, H3188I feel such assistance to this particulargroup of recipients is extremely neces-sary, although still not adequate.The family assistance program offerscertain work incentives which in itself isnot a new principle. This program, how-ever, extends the principle and makes itmore effective. There would not only be a$30 minimum monthly training incentive,but also a $60 monthly cost-of-work dis-regard. Training for decent, acceptablejobs with a 50 percent retention of earn-ings is certainly a broader incentive planthan we are currently experiencing. Cer-tain training expenses as well as trans-portation costs that would be reimbursedplus supportive services to encouragecontinued employment seem to me addi-tional feasible incentives to participatein the work training program. Most im-portantly, however, the mother would begiven a greater opportunity for success-ful employment by the establishment ofuallty day-care centers This last pro-posal opens up a grand potential in thepoverty struggle; and it is in this areathat I feel the family assistance plan isnot sufficiently developed.There are specified work requirementsthat function with the incentive program.Training\u2014with mandatory registrationof recipients at a local employment of-fice\u2014and employment are compulsoryfor benefits, and there is required a re-ferral of family assistance recipients with-physical or mental disabilities for voca-tional rehabilitation.Such are the major propositions of thefamily assistance plan. Recognition ofthe fundamental problem areas is ade-quate and I support any efforts in such abasic direction. I wish to emphasize, how-ever, that this plan should be only thebeginning of a massive awakening toour welfare programs and treatment ofthe poor. I agree that the Federal Gov-ernmen.t should provide minimum in-come standards for those unable to work.Similarily, able-bodied adults\u2014of which80,000 males are currently on the wel-fare rolls\u2014should be given remedial edu-cation, training, and jobs. It must beremembered that mere funding does notguarantee wise application of dollars bythe recipient. Mandatory training andwork requirements are not the sole chan-nel through which incentive will develop;the job, Income, and living conditions ofthe breadwinner and family must alsofoster human dignity. For this reason, Iwish to express my serious concern overthe stifling effect of the inadequate in-come offered to the recipient, the lack ofan effective job placement program, andthe undeveloped potential of the day-care center program.The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statisticshas not employed an objective standardof determining the genuine need for afamily'sminimumexpenditureson decent food, clothing, and shelter. TheDepartment of Labor, however, has of-fered $5,500 a year as a standard incomeneeded for a family of four. Interestinglyenough, Americancitizenshavere- sponded to nationwide poll questions es-tablishing a minimum need at $6,240. Itseems ludicrous that the family assist-ance program should construct a mini-mum level of $1,600 for the same family,and a ceiling of only $3,720. Thus, a four-CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEmember family receiving the highest as-sistance benefits would barely creep overthe official poverty line of $3,552 peryear. The program should also containa provision for automatic cost-of-livingincreases, now rated at 6.2 percent eachyear. If a family is to help itself up thesocial and economic ladder, it certainlymust be able to afford decent living con-ditions. I feel there must definitely andas immediately as possible be additionallegislation furthering this goal of placingeach American family above the povertyline.second, if a job training program isoffered it is totally unrealistic to assumeit a function of the work-incentive prin-ciple unless participants can be guaran-teed a decent job at the conclusion of histraining. What kind of incentive canthere be in a program that could possiblyforce a person to do menial labor at sub-standard wages? And what measure ofassurance is there regarding continuedemployment if the worker cannot evenfind meaningful satisfaction in his labor?Inclusion of the working poor is a revo-lutionary step in our welfare efforts, butsuccess in raising the self-sufficiency andindependence of the worker will not beachieved unless more adequate job place-ment programs are developed.Third, I would like to suggest extendedand varied use of the day-care programs.Six billion dollars_accommodating onlyabout 500,000 children\u2014has been sanc-tioned for such centers but truly effectiveutilization of them requires more fund-ing and attention.Quality day-care services are extreme-ly important not only to the success ofthe working parent, but to the future de-velopment and growth of the childrenwho have so unwittingly landed in apoverty striken home. A child should beable to remain in his own home andneighborhood. Effective and successfulphysical, emotional, social, and intel-lectual growth of the young child in theday-care center requires participation inand by the community.These centers could provide not onlyhealth and educational programs forchildren, but they could become a focusof community participation and inter-ests. Adult education and consumer in-formation could be offered. Recreationalpotentials of such facilities are enormousas well as important and necessary tothe poor community. Centers such as thiscould become a place of community con-cern, as local attitudes can aid in fight-ing our poverty crisis In this country.The present AFDC program keeps as-sistance below the minimum necessaryfor a humane level of existence. Thereare so many persons desperately in needwho are currently being excluded fromhelp. The nature of the current systemrepeatedly implies that the recipients arelazy. The welfare worker must combineboth his investigative and service func-tions which further alleviates the poor.The family assistance program could be-gin to ease these tensions, and pave theway to -a newer economic and socialorientation toward an old problem. Theproposed Federal assistance and stand-ards are a beginning, but I feel the needfor more extended and conclusive pro-grams Is extremely critical if we are togenuinely help our poor citizens.April 16,1970Mr. CRANE. Mr. Chairman, I cannotsupport the bill before the House in itscurrent form. I cannot support it be-cause, while I favor legislation to re-form our welfare system, I do not believethat this bill would represent any sig-nificant progress toward that end.This bill has been presented to us asan effort not only to reform and sim-plify the existing hodgepodge of wel-fare and assistance programs, but toprovide an incentive to get people offof welfare. The objective is a noble one,but we have little assurance that it wouldbe accomplished. Indeed, there is sub-stantial reason to believe that it couldhave just the opposite effect: that per-sons who have always been among the\"working poor\" would find it to theireconomic advantage to stop working anddepend on welfare altogether.Mr. Chairman, last November Prof.MiltonFriedman,thedistinguishedUniversityof Chicago economist onwhose proposal for a \"negative incometax\" this legislation is based, testifiedbefore the Committee on Ways andMeans. While expressing his general ap-proval of the concept of the bill, he drewthe committee's attention to what he con-sidered to be several serious flaws\u2014andthose flaws have not been corrected. I amnot in total agreement with ProfessorFriedman, for reasons which I shall dis-cuss shortly, but I nevertheless believehe made some important points in hisstatement to the committee, and I in-clude that testimony in the RECORD atthis point in my remarks:STATEMENT OF Da. MILr0N FRIEDMAN, PROFES-SOR, DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMICS, UNIVER-SITY OF CHICAGODr. FRIEDMAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Iam glad to be here.The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Burke, just a moment.I am a little bit out of place here.Dr. Friedman, I want the committee toknow that I have known you and know ofyou for many, many years, dating back to thetime when I served with a great deal ofpleasure on the Joint. Economic Committeeduring the 1950's. I want to personally wel-come you to the committee.Dr. FRIEDMAN. Thank you very much, Mr.Mills. It is a pleasure to testily before thiscommtitee. My connections with it go backvery much farther, to 1941, when I was anemployee of the Division of Tax Research ofthe U.S. Treasury Department.The CHAIRMAN. I know that.Dr. FREIDMAN. I strongly endorse the basicprinciples embodiedinPresidentNixon's proposal for reforming our welfare system:the provision of a strong work incentive; theequal treatment of equals; eligibility require-ments based on the objective criterion of in-come; the separation of financial azslstancefrom other social services. These are prin-ciples that I have long supported and longirged. The President's proposal does not goas far as I would like to go in replacing thepresent welfare system by a system Incorpo-rating these principles, but it is a major andwelcome step in that direction.The proposed reform has the potential ofgreatly improving the social and economicconditions of lower income families In theUnIted States, while at the same time reduc-ing the burden imposed on the taxapyer tohelp the disadvantaged. But these high hopeswill be realized only if Congress can avoid anumber of pitfalls in translating the princi-ples into practice.In my testimony, I wish to direct the com-mittee's attention to three problems that re-quire careful treatment if the principles areto be made effective. Unless this Is done, April 16, 1970thereis real danger that actions taken onthe details of the plan will have the effect ofcompletely undermining its effectiveness andof converting it from a major step forward toa major step backward. These problems areraised by a number of specific features ofthe imaginative and thoughtful proposalthat is before you.The problems are\u2014and here I summarizethe three problems and then I am going toreturn mostly to discuss the first of these.The problems are:(1)Keeping the marginal tax rate lowenough to provide a real work incentive. Thisis by all odds the most important Issue.The basic, marginal rate is stated to be 50percent. However, social security and othertaxes, and the method of handling Statesupplements and of integrating food stampswith welfare payments, threaten to raise theeffective marginal rate to well above 50 per-cent, and in some cases to more than 100percent.(2) Assuring equal treatment to equals.Persons in similar circumstances who are atthe same income level should be treated thesame whether or not they are currently re-ceiving welfare payments. The present pro-posals do not achieve this objective.(3) Providing administrative arrangementsthat will best lend themselves to Yurvher im-provement and development of the welfaresystem.In my opinion,thiswouldbe achieved far better. by having the InternalRevenue Bureau administer the negative in-come tax features of the plan along with thepositive income tax than by assigning admin-istration to HEW.I. RE'rAININO A WORK INCENTIVEIn my opinion, the most Important needin welfare reform is to provide a strong in-centive for persons receiving governmentalassistance to become self-supporting. ThePresident's proposal does so by two key pro-visions: first, disregarding the first 8720 sec-ond, disregarding half ofthe remainingearned income. As you are well aware, thisis precisely equivalent to a tax schedule withmarginal rates of zero at first and then of50 percent.For the class of persons involved, 50 per-cent Is a very high rate. Yet, given the presentlow exemptions under the positive incometax, which requires that the payment of ben-efits be ended at a moderate income level, itis hard to construct a feasible scheme with amuch lower rate. In my own proposals for anegative income tax, I have reluctantly rec-ommended a 50-percent rate, viewing it asthe highest that would give families a strongenough incentive to work themselves off re-lief.The addition of an initial zero bracketseems to me an excellent idea. It providesmaximum incentive where that incentive ismost needed\u2014to make the transition from noemployment to some employment\u2014and yetraises the breakeven point only modestly.The two-step schedule of zero and then 50percent is therefore an excellent compro-mise, and I support it fully. The problem Isthat, when additional features of the pro-posed plan, plus other features of currentlaw, plus the proposals about food 8tams,are taken into account, the final schedule isnot a two-step schedule and the final ratesare often far higher than zero and 50 percent.This is clear from the figures in the ac-companying table. I hope you gentlemen havethis table, which is the last page of this pre-pared statement, because I would like to referto It in explaining the further comments.In constructing this table, I have describedthe proposal in tax terms, which seems theterms which would be moat familiar to yougentlemen on this committee as well se teamost effective way to present it.(This description 18 different from the wayI have usuafly described such plans. I haveCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014HOUSEusually described them as involving an ex-eption and a schedule of rates for variousbrackets of negative taxable Income (in-come minus exemptions). That descriptionhas the great advantage that it makes clear'the relation between such plans and the posi--tive income tax. For the present purpose,however, it has the disadvantage that boththe exemptions and the rates are altered asadditional items are taken into account.That is why I have used the equivalent al-ternative description embodied In the table.)The way I have done it Is to treat the bene-fit received by any family as the differencebetween two items:first, a basic benefit;second, a tax imposed on all income otherthan the benefit at graduated rates but withno exemptions. The excess of the basic bene-fit over the tax Is the net amount the familyreceives (or the excess of the tax over thebasic benefit the net amount it pays).To keep matters simple, I have consideredonly a family of four with two adults and twodependents, and I have assumed that anyincome other than the basic benefit Is sarned income.The first part of 'the table, part A, is forthe 20 States in which the family assistanceprogram would replace completely the pres-ent AFDC program. In these States, the basicbeneflt--.the amount that would be receivedby a family with no other Income\u2014consistsof two parts: (1) A family assistance pay-ment of $1,600;(2)Food stamps worth$720\u2014or a total of $2,320. This would also bethe net benefit received If the family had noother income.(In calculating the food stamp allowance,I have followed the President's proposal,which, as I understand it, would provide amaximum of $1,200, this amount to be re-duced by 30 percent of total income, in-cluding any family assistance benefit. A fam-ily that received the $1,600 family assistancebenefit only would therefore 'be entitled to$1,200 less 30 percent of $1,600 or $1,200 less$480, which equals $720.)If the family earns up to $720 of income,its family assistance benefit is not affected,so the marginal tax ,rate, because of thefamilyassistanceplan,iszero. That isshown in the right-hand part of that firstpart of the table. The first column gives theincome bracket, and the second the marginalrate for that bracket.However, its food stamp allotment is re-duced by 30 percent of its additional Income,as I understand the proposal on food stampsthat has been made, so the marginal tax ratebecause of food stamps is 30 percent. Inaddition, it will have to pay 4.8 percent forOASI and nothing for Federal Income tax,so, going across the table, the total marginaltax rate on that first bracket is 34.8 percent,combining the food stamps plus the socialsecurity.The next bracket runs to $3,000, the pointat which the Federal income tax, under cur-rent law, becomes effective. Your committeehas, of course, voted to change this pro-vision of current law, but in view of theuncertainty about the precise nature of thefinal tax reform legislation, I have thoughtit best to stick to the present law, includ-ing the expiration of the s1rtax.In this bracket, that is, the bracket be-tween $720 and $3,000, the family assistancebenefit is reduced by 50 percent for eachadditional dollar earned, so the marginal taxrate because of the family assistance pro-gram is 60 percent. The food stamp ratedrops to 15 percent from 30 percent becausethe food stamp allowande is reduced only onaccount of the extra 50 cents of each dollarof earnings that is retained by the family.The other items are the same as before, sothe total marginal rate Is 69.8 percent.At $3,000, the Federal income tax applies,making the total marginal rate 83.8 percent.At $3,920, the family-assistance benefit hasbeen reduced to zero, so this item drops out.H 3189reducing the total marginal rate to 48.8 per-cent. At $4,000, the food-stamp allowancehas been reduced to zero, so this item dropsout leaving only social security taxes plusFederal fncome tax, which combined equaljust under 20 percent.For the crucial range from $720 to $3,920,these are extremely high rates\u2014as high as orhigher than the top rate under our positiveIncome tax. In addition, under present law,families on welfare may keep up to $30 aweek plus one-third of the balance of out-side earnings without a reduction in bene-fits, so the effective rate for them for earnedincomes between $360 a year and $3,000 is66 2/3percentplus the social security rate,or a total of 71.5 percent, and for earnedincomes above $3,000, when they becomesubject to Federal income tax, 85.5 percent.The marginal rtes implicit in the familyassistance program are only trivially lowerthan the rates in current law, except onlyfor earned incomes between $360 and $720a year. Yet we are all cruelly aware that cur-rent rates do not provide an adequate incen-tive for families to work their way off wel-fare.Moreover, the rates in part A of thetable are the most favorable. They are for theStates in which the family assistance pro-gram will completely supersede AFDC. Forall the other States, the marginal rates arestill higher.The exact rates vary from State to State,depending on the maximum benefit nowpayable. In section B of the table, I havecalculated the rate for a sample State thathas a current maximum benefit of $3,400 ayear for a family of four. I believe that thisis roughly the maximum In New York andmay be in others as well. In any event, it willserve to give approximate upper limits.For such a State, the basic benefit hasthree parts, listed in the lefthand part ofthe table:(1)the basicbenefit of $1,600;(2) and (3) a food stampallowance of $180 ($1,200 minus 30 percent of$3,400) \u2014or a total of $3,680.Under the proposal, the State is not per-mitted to reduceits supplementary pay-ment on account of the first $720 of earnedincome. It is permitted to reduce its sup-plementary payment by up to 16% per-cent of the next $3,200 of earned incomeand by up to 80 percent of still higher earnedIncome.I have assumed that the sample State ap-plies these maximums, This explains themarginal rates in the column for the Statesupplement, which is the only additionalcolumn In the bottom half of the table com-pared to the top.For this State, the food stamp allowancedrops out at $600, reducing the total mar-ginal rate from 34.8 percent to 4.8 percent.The rate then jumps at $720 to 71.5 percent,and at $3,000 to 85.5 percent. These are pre-cisely the same marginal rates as under pres-ent law. Above $3,920, the rates are still moreextreme, even exceeding 100 percent for abracket just over $500 wide, and then de-clining to 20.8 percent.And even this is not the whole story. I havecompletely neglected city and State taxes onearnings or income, which, in those citiesand States where they exist, raise the margi-nal rates still higher.These are clearly not very desirable tax rateschedules. They are irregular, declining andrising in a pattern that it is hard to justifyon rational grounds. More important, formost of the range of incomes they are fartoo high to acheive the objectives of thePresident's proposal. In no State do theyprovide much more Incentive than does thepresent law for recipients of welfare to worktheir way out of welfare. In some States,they provide decidedly less Incentive thanthe present law. H 3190Persuaded as I am of the merits of thePresident's general approach, I am convincedthat. it would be a tragic mistake to enactit in the form embodied in these tables.These high marginal races are. I am sure, in-advertent\u2014the unexpected combined resultor a series of separate decisions. In lookingat them as a whole, this committee canenormously improve the present proposalsby insisting that no combined marginal taxrate should exceed 50 percent.The proposals that the committee has al-ready made for reforming the positive Incometax will help reduce the marginal rates. Butthis change, important as It is. will not bringthem anywhere close to 50 percent for muchof the income range.The other measures that seem most prom-ising are:(1) Reconsideration of the foodstap allowance proposal; (2)alternatively,revising the family assistance basic grantand tax schedule so that, when combinedwith food stamps, they provide the basicgrant and tax schedule now proposed for thefamily assistance program alone; (3)not permitting States to reduce their supplementfor the first 3,920 of earned income, and thenpermitting them to reduce their supplementby not more than 50 percent of earned in-come in excess of $3,920.II. EQUAL TREATMENT OP EQUALSUnder the present proposal, if Jane andMary work side-by-side in a factory, receivethe same low wages, have the same size fam-ily, and are in similar circumstances in stillother respects, they may still receive differ-ent net beneftts. They will do so if Jane wasformerly a member of a family on AF'DCwhile Mary was employed and received nowelfare payments, and If they are in a Statethat now provides benefits higher than thefamily assistance benefits. In that case, theState Is required to continue to supplementthe income of Jane but not of Mary.Similarly, as I interpret the proposed law,Jane and Mary may have differential accessto manpower and training programs and tochild care services. If the earned income ofboth is high enough to reduce the familyassistancenetbenefittozero,butlow enough to entitle Jane, who was formerly onAFDC (to supplementary State benefits).then Jane will also have access to the otherprograms, while Mary will not.This is highly inequitable. It is also per-verse in its effect on incentives. It encour-ages the working poor to quit working and toqualify for welfare in order to get the addi-tional benefits. Equals should be treatedequally.UI. ADMINISTRATION OP THE PROGRAMI beUeve that our ultimate goal should bea complete integration of assistance to low-income families with collection of taxesfrom higher income families. All persons should be treated alike. AU should be re-quired to file the same or equivalent tax re-turns. If the income as calculated turns outto be below the exemptions provided by law,the taxpayer will be entitled to receive apayment, a negative income tax. If the in-come as calculated turns out to be above theexemptions, the taxpayer will pay a tax.This will end the present demeaning divi-sion of our population into two classes\u2014people on welfare and the rest of us. It willend the present demeaning eligibility re-quirements for assistance. It will subject allto the same criterion of ability to pay\u2014areasonably objective measure of level of in-come. It will also improve greatly the ad-ministration of both the positive and nega-tive tax by requiring essentially universalfiling and thereby reducing the opportunitiesfor avoidance and evasion of tax. Finally, itwill be politically healthy, because no addi-tional beneftts could be legislated without Si-multaneously altering the tax structure, andconversely.This goal is thoroughly feasible in the notCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEtoo distant future. The main obslacle at themoment is simply the different definitionsof income employed for the positive incometax and the proposed negative income taxand the limited scope of the family assistanceprogram.The goal will become far less feasible, how-ever, if the administration of the new pro-gramisassigned to the Department ofHealth, Education, and Welfare Instead ofto the Internal Revenue Service. That willassure the growth of two largely distinctadministrative hierarchies, two sets of de-tailed regulations and rulings, and two setsof political vested interests.In addition to keeping open the feasibilityof an integrated income tax structure, thereare other advantages in administration by theInternal Revenue Service, notably the con-tribution that would be made to the promptand efficient collection of positive incometaxes now avoided or evaded.And I might add to my written testimonyone minor example that I should have in-cluded. We now deduct tax at source throughInternal Revenue withholding. The right wayto provide an income supplement to peoplewho are working but have incomes below theexemption. level is to add to their paychecksin exactly the same process, which illustratesone way in which combining the two wouldrender the administration of both efficient.In deciding this issue of where the admin-istration should be placed, I urge the com-mittee to look not merely to the present butalsp to the future.Thank you very much.Mr. BURKE. Thank you, Professor Friedman.Are there any questions?Mr. BYRNE5. Mr. Chairman?The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Byrnes.Mr. BYRNES. I was intrigued with your laststatement about administration of incomesupplements.I think we do have seriousproblems. I have some great concern aboutusing the SocialSecurity Administrationwith the old age and survivors insurancesystem rather than having the administra-tion of supplements stand separately. But Iam intrigued with your statement that youwould provide the benefits under the negativeincome tax through the paycheck.Dr. FRIEDMAN. Yes. You see, that is the ap-propriate way to do it for those people whoare receiving benefits, what the proposal calls\"the working poor.\"Mr. BYRNES. I wonder where do we comeout when we start making the employer\u2014Dr. FRIEDMAN. We now do it. We now do itfor the subtraction from the paycheck.Mr. BYaNxs. Well, we do in part, but thenwe also provide for a recapitulation at theend. You would be taking out monef thatthe employer has an obligation, in a sense,to pay to the employee in an employer-em-ployee relationship. Now you would bringin an employer relationship to the FederalGovernment in terms of the money.Dr. FRIEDMAN. Representative Byrnes, I would also in administering this programhave an annual recapitulation for those whoreceive as well as those who pay. I wouldtreat both groups alike. You must do thatin any event because you will be operatingthe family assistance program on the basisof advance estimates and you need a recon-ciliation in order to compare what happensafter the event with what was planned.So the same worker, for example, mightin some weeks be receiving a supplement tohis pay and in other weeks having his in-come taxsubtracted,becausethe same worker might one week have a wage that wasso low that if he continued on that level forthe year, be would be\u2014Mr. BYRNES. We have so much trouble to-day, though. Professor, in my judgment,with respect to the refund recapitulationwith such a higher percentage having re-funds. Would we get Into a morass of prob-April 16,1970.lems here as we add this factor into the\u2014Dr. FRIEDMAN. This reduces that problem,Mr. Byrnes, because now one of the reasotisyou have refunds is precisely that if a per-son who is employed falls below the level atwhich taxes should be subtracted from hispay, nothing is subtracted and nothing isadded. And as a result he accumulates abenefit which later on provides him With arefund.By treating him throughout the year sym-metrically on both sides of the exemption.the problem of refunds, I believe, would inthe main be reduced and not made worse.In both cases. it 'seems tome, the employerwould be acting as an agent of the FederalGovernment. He is now acting as an agentof the Federal Government in subtractingthe withholding taxes. He would also be act-ing as an agent of the Federal Governmentin supplementing the wages by whateverprovision was made for such supplementa-tion.In both cases the employee would have toprovide once a year a form reconciling whatwas deducted or added during the year withwhat he was entitled to and with his othersources of income. And it is precisely thispossibility of combining these different partsor our structure that seems to me a majorargument in favor of having this admin-istered by the Internal Revenue Servicerather than linking it with social security.Mr. BYRNES. Of course, what we havedone\u2014and I think probably quite inten-tionally\u2014is to have a system that in manycases overwithholds as a collection device.Do you suggest that as far as the negativepayments are concerned, you would under-pay for the same basic reason. so that atthe end of the year you would be more in-clined to be paying the family some addi-tional funds rather than having to requirethem to pay back some funds that they hadalready received?Dr. FRIEDMAN. Under our present withhold-ing we do have a great many refunds be-cause of overcollection, but we also have agreat many people who underpay and haveto pay subsequently, because with the bestwill In the world it is impossible to collectfrom allaccurately.I would expect thatdoing the best Job you could, you would findthat in paying out the negative taxes justas in collecting the positive taxes, you wouldhave a considerable number of people whowould have to pay additional sums, but alsoa considerable number who would receiverefund.Clearly, if I were setting this up, I mighttry to veer us a little bit in the direction ofunderpayment but not much, because thecontemporary cost to the people of beingunderpaid, it seems to me, would be ratherimportant.Mr. BYRNES. You address your whole perhere to the dollar-and-cents FRIEDMAN. Right.Mr. BYRNES. And, of course, that can't beunderestimated in its importance, but to meone of the major thrusts of equal significanceand importance, and which in some respectsmay be even more important in the longrun.is the thrust of the administrationproposal placing the emphasis on job train-ing, bringing job opportunities together withthe individual.And I wonder whether the emphasis youput here doesn't almost ignore that aspect.Dr. FRIEDMAN. I believe not.Mr. BYRNES. Or do you think it can beignored?Dr. FRIEDMAN. Oh, no. I don't.Mr. BYRNES. What is your attitude in thatarea?Dr. FRIEDMAN. I don't believe it can beignored. But I believe that those aspects of.the proposal will not be effective unless thepeople Involved have a very strong incentiveto take advantage of the opportunities thatare open. April 16,1970Mr.BYRNES. That is your 50 percent?Dr. FRIEDMAN. Right. It seems to me youhave two problems. One is to have opportuni-ties available. The second problem Is to makethe people themselves who are Involved havea strong incentive to take advantage of thoseopportunities.No civil servant bureaucrat is going to beable, with the best intentions in the world,to pick out which people thould get thetraining, which people should have the op-portunities, and force them to do it. That hasto. come from the individual himself.One of the most effective ways to have itcome from the individual Is to give him asgreat an incentive as possible to take advan-tage of the opportunities available. We are,seems to me, asking a good deal of a veryimpoverished person, a person of a very lowincome level, if we say to him, \"You go takea job and work, leave your home and Incurthe extra expenses of going back and forth.But, of course, you are only going to get back30 cents for every extra dollar you earn, orat a higher level you are only going to getback 16 cents for every dollar 'you earn.\"It seems to me that unless we can say topeople, \"You will get back half of what youearn, anyway, at least,\" it is going to be veryhard to provide them with the kind of in-centive that you and I would like them to have to take advantage of the opportunitiesavailable.I may say on one other point that Is sug-gested by your comment, one of the majorreasons why I would like to see this handledevenhandedly, and particularly the withhold-ing. arrangement, is for nonmonetary rea-sons. If the program is handled by HEW asproposed, those people Who receive a paymentare in a Wholly different category from thosewho don't. They have to go and make specialapplication at a different office. They aregoing to get a separate check somewhereelse.Particularly for the working people whoare receiving a supplement, if you can inte-grate the whole thing, everybody in thatfactory working In the plant is on the samebasis. There aren't two classes of citizens.Everybody gets his paycheck at the end ofthe week. Some of the people who have hadhigh pay have a little deducted. Others whohave had low pay have a little added. And a person may shift from one category to an-other from month to month. From the pointof view of morale and of not making peoplefeel that they are somehow pariahs andmaking them participate in the activity ofthe economy, it seems to me that is a very great advantage.Mr. BYRNES. Your paper and your corn- meets are most Intriguing and most InIer-esting. Thank you very much.Mr. BURKE. Are there any further, ques- tions?Mr. Corman?Mr. CORMAN.Thahicyou, Mr. Chairman.Dr.' Friedman, would you agree tha.t we really can't consider a negative income taxuntil we get to the point where we tax allsources of wealth? We get ourselves In thisdilemma Where people may have a rather sulbstanjtial number of dollars at their dis-posal and yet they aren't suhject to theincome lax.What woukj we do with them when we talk about the negative income tax?Dr. FRIEDMAN This is what was intended in the comment I made here when I said that the ohief barrier at the moment is simply the different definitions of income employed for the positive income tax and the negative In- come tax. As an ultimate ideal I agree thor- oughly with what you say. I would myself like to see a far more far-reaching reform of the entire positive and negative income tax structure so thatallincomes would betreated alike.But I believe we want to be very careful not to let the best destroy the good. I thinkCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014HOUSEwe see now faced with a situation in whichwe have a dha.nce to improve the system as awhole substanlt2ially by introducing the prin-ciple of a negative income tax but with adifferent definition of \"income\" than thatwhich is used for the positive income tax.That is a step forward.Let's not refrain from taking it becausethere is a still bigger step that you and Iwould like to take as the opportunity offers.Mr. CORMAN. Another question I have COflq cerns the supplement to the paycheck, In thelong run What effect is that going to have on the willingness of employers to pay livingwages out of their own pockets.Dr. FRIEDMAN.Itwill have no effect, sir, be-cause the willingness of employers to paywhat they have to day does not derive fromtheir social conscience, it does not derivefrom their concept of a living pay. It derivesfrom competition, it derives from the fact that unless they pay as muoh as other em- ployers pay, they are not going to get anybodyto work fOr ibsen.So there Is no reason that I can see why from the side of the employer he will be af- fected in any significant way by the fact that in part he is serving as an agent of the Fed- eral Government.Let me put It to you, if I may, anotherway, If his administering this for the FederalGovernment wouldaffecthim, then hisknowledge that 'the 'individual is getting a supplementary check from the social secur- ity board or somebody else Would have the same effect, fld I think that it would bevery hard on economic grounds to see any reason why that should 'have any measurableeffect on the wages. Not that he wouldn't be willing to pay more. Any employer is willing to pay an indefinite amount if he can afford to do so. But he can't afford to pay more than the market requires him to pay to at- tract t'he labor, and 'he can't afford to pay less, 'because if he pays less, he doesn't get any workers, if he pays more, he is going togo out of business.Mr. CORMAN. Yes, sir, but my concern is of the marginal Worker, the person who doesn't have great skill, and there is competition for those Jobs.Itpresents a dilemma. You don'twant the man to live on less 'than a reason- able amount of money.On the other hand, I would think that this employer might say, \"I can pay you at the poverty level. The Governnent is going to subsidize a portion of it, and I will pay you the rest, and you take the Job.\"I think I would be concerned with whomwe are really subsidizing with supplementarypayments, it seems to me we have to hedgethose with some protection for the other taxpay'ers,to require minimum wages orsomething of that sort, it seems to me we Just compound the problem if we tell the employer, \"You don't want to pay him any wages. Ve will supplement it, and you putit on the 'paycheck. And the employee is going to go home with enough dollars to keep body and soul together, even though it isn't going to cost you very much of It.\"You really don't think that is a problem?Dr. FRIEDMAN.Onthe contrary, I believe,sir, that it isreally rather the Other wayaround.One of the reasons we have unduly highunemployment among the so-called \"mar-ginal\" and \"skilled\" workers is because ofthe effect of the minimum wage rate, the legal minimum wage rate, which arises be- cause of a confusion between a wage rate andincome. It has always been mystery to me how a teenage boy is better off being unem- ployed at $1.60 an hour than being employedat $1.40 an hour. And yet the effect of theminimum wage rate has been to render un- employed, people whose economic productiv-ity does not equal the minimum wage rate. What the well meaning peoponenta or theminimum wage rate have wanted to do is toprovide some kind of a minimum income,H3191not a minimum wage rate, which is of novalue unless employment Is available, on that rate. In fact, the effect of this kind of a negative income tax program isprecisely that it serves the real function which thewell meaning proponents of minimum wagerates have mistakenly believed that theycould serve by minimum wage rates. It servesthat real function of enabling people toearn what they can In the market, whatevertheir skill, and improve their skills throughon-the-job training, while at the same time,through supplementing their income, youmaintain a minimum level of take-home pay,which isavailable for them to purchasegoods and services.The fear that the employer would some- how be In a position to take advantage ofthis is a very understandable and naturalfear. But I believe It does not correspondto the facts of the marketplace.With respect to the group of workers we are now speaking of, there are, in general inmost market areas in the country, a con- siderable number of potential employers.Those potential employers are in competi-tion with one another, and they have no ef- fective leeway to pay people less, simplybecause they are getting some supplementfrom somewhere else.Mr. BURKE. Mr. Gibbons?Mr. GIBBONS. Dr. Friedman, I am Intriguedby your testimony. I never had an op!por- tunity to read much of your material exceptwhat has appeared in the newspapers, andyou have thrown some new light on it heretoday.You are suggesting that perhaps a way that this could be worked, your negative income, is by adding through a private busi-ness employer an additional amount ofmoney, just as we now deduct an additionalamount of money from the paycheck for theInternal Revenue. I woujci assume, follow-ing that on through, that eventually, the employer would have to get the money from somebody. He would get the money from the Government the same way be now pays the money to the Government, He would just submit a statement saying that, in effect, \"I have so many people who are employed,and they have this kind ofa social back-ground. Therefore, I ant entitled to money back.\"This is a silly situation, but I could envision an employer perhaps going to employees and saying, \"Maybe you bettergo home andhave a few more kids. You don't want to work any harder, but I can get'more money for what you are now doing.\"Dr. FRIEDMAN. No, sir.Mr. GIBBONS. You don't think it will work that Way?Dr. FRIEDMAN. No, it doesn't work that way now with the positive income tax. He doesn'tsay to the employees, \"Why don't you go home so I don't have to payover to the Government as much in withholding tax.\"The actual way it would work is that each employer would be withholding from mostof his employees. The number of employ-ees whose wages he would be supplementingwould be relatively small. Given the kindof tax rates you have been thinking of, hewould hand Into the Internal Revenue a net payment. Re would pay over. Re would say,\"This is the amount of money I have col- lected on your behalf. This is the amountof money I have paid out on your behalf.The difference Is the amount I pay over to you.\"Mr. GIBBONS. Wouldn't your program reallyencourage the employer to discriminate andto hire the poor and the disadvantaged andthe large family person, as opposed to a single person, perhaps?Dr. FRIEDMAN. Not at all. His wage cost isexactly the same regardless of the familystatus. His personal wage cost that entersinto business calculations is not affected bythe family status of the person, just as now H 3192the fact that he has to deduct more from thepay of a man with a small family, of a singleperson, than of a man with a large familydoes not lead him now to prefer the man withthe large family. His wage cost is a wage ratehe pays for the job to the man whom heemploys.Then In addition to that, he now servesas an agent of the Internal Revenue in with-holding at source from that man's pay thetaxes that are due to the Federal Govern-ment in the same way he would serve as anagent of the Federal Government or the In-ternal Revenue in paying over an additionalsum to which the man was entitled.Mr. GIBBONS. Let me give you an illustra-tion,Suppose you have a man working on anassembly line and maybe he is making $2an hour, and he Is operating a machine orsomething like that. That would be prettyminimum pay. He turns out z number ofproducts an hour, which result in an eco-nomic benefit tohis employer, so much..If that man were poor\u2014of course, he wouldbe poor at $2 an hour\u2014but if that man werepoor, let's say, then hIs employer would, ineffect, get a refund from the Federal Gov-ernment, which he would in turn pay to thatman.Dr. FRIEDMAN. That Is right.Mr. GIBBONS. Yet he would still be pay-ing $2 an hour, wouldn't he?Dr. FRIEDMAN. That is right.Mr. GIBBONS. And maybe the man wouldthen be taking home $2.25 an hour, or $2.50an hour. It looks like to me that therewould be a great encouragement in your sys-tem to hire the poor first.Dr. FRIEDMAN. No.Mr. GIBBONS. I wish you would draw me aCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEpicture of it.I don't want to take up thecommittee's time.Dr. FRIEDMAN. Let me give you this.Here right now an employer hires peo-ple at $2 an hour, some of whom, for allhe knows, have extra income and some ofwhom don't. Does that affect which oneshe hires? Or does he pay those who haveextra income outside less money than hepays those who don't?Right now suppose you adopted the pro-posal as suggested by the President. Thenthe employer would know. Re would knowperfectly well that John Jones is gettingan additional check from somebody becauseof the fact that he has six children andhas a lower income than the income hewould have to have In order not to receivea grant, so he knows what he is getting.Employers are not fools. They know per-fectly well what the other arrangementsare, and so changing the bookkeeping byhaving somebody a block down the streethand the man the check; Instead of com-bining it with the payroll operation of thefirm itself, doesn't change the facts.Mr. GIBBONS. I regret to say most of uslive by forms. Have you ever gone so far inyour thinking as to figureoUtwhatthe new form 1040 would look like under your pro-posal?Dr. FRIEDMAN. Yes.Mr. GIBBONS. Do y\u00e0u have that?Dr. FRIEDMAN. I don't have that with me,but I have in earlier cases when I haveworked on thisdrawn up forms1040 to han- dle the negative income tax.Mr. GIBBONS. I wonder if you could justsupply one, so we could put it in the recordat this point.Mr. Chairman, would that be all right?Dr.FRIEDMAN.I will see if I can get one.April 16, 1970 \"Unfortunately, I was unableto locate in time the forms I had drawn up earlier and time did not permit my writing out newones in full. However, for form 1040, onlychanges that would be necessarywould be (a) to add several lines in computation oftax parallel to those now used in computa-tion of positive tax, e.g.:(1) If deductions and exemptions exceedreported taxable income, enter excess here.\"'(2) See Tax Table\u2014for payment to whichyou are entitled.\"(3) Enter advance payments receivedduring year.'(4) Enter any taxes withheld during year.\"'(5) If (2) and (4)is greater than (3),enter excess here.

And I would like to see whatthe form looks like that the employer wouldfurnish the Internal Revenue Service toclaim the additional compensation.Those are all the questions I have, Mr.Chairman.Mr. BURKE. Thank you, We thank you verymuch, Professor Friedman, for your appear-ance here today and your testimony.I can assure you the entire membershipof the committee and the committee staffwill study your statement very carefully andalso your chart.Thank you.Dr. FRIEDMAN. Thank you.(The chart referred to follows:) MARGINAL TAX RATES IMPLICIT IN WELFARE PROPOSALIfamily of 4(2 adults, 2 dependenfs); all income earned (other than welfare grants and food stamps); city and State income taxes neglecledjA. 20 STATES WHICH NOW PAY BENEFITS LESS THAN PROPOSED FAMILY ASSISTANCE BENEFITS 'Income excludes basic grant and is all assumed to be earned income.Employee's tax under OASI.ProfessorFrledman objects to this billon the following basis:First, that when the value of foodstamps and State supplementary benefitsis figured In, the marginal 'tax rate on theearned income of the working poor Is farhigher than the apparent 50 percent\u2014that, Indeed, it may actually come tomore than 100 percent, thus providinga serious disincentive 'to accept employ-ment rather than the incentive that thisprogram Is designed to create;Second, that families in simile\" -nomicsituations should be treated equai-ly, and that 'this is not the case underthe provisions of the bill as it now stands,either In the regulations relating to Statesupplemental benefits or in the advan-tages it may give persons who do notwork over those who do. Thus, the actTax scheduleMarginal (percent) $5,000 B.

This Is a clear incentivefor the working men to \"arrange\" unem- April 16,1970CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSE H3193ployment category status in order toqualify for the extra benefit; andThird, that the arrangements proposedto administer the provisions of this billare cumbersome and costly, and that itcould actually be administered far moreefficiently through the system already inexistence for payroll deductions and in-come tax payments.Let me conclude this section of my re-marks by noting that Professor Fried-man\u20144he rather of 'the negative incometax\u2014stated in a public meeting lastSaturday, Atn-il 11, 1970, in Chicago that:If I were a Memler of Congress, I ou1dvote against HR. 16311, as itis presently wrItten.As I have indicated, however, I amnot totally in agreement with ProfessorFriedman. One of the main objectionsthat I have to the pending bill, that hedoes not share, is the inclusion of theworking poor in the Nation's welfarepopulation. I must object to this onseveral counts: First, its cost; second,its bureaucratic implications; and third,its moral and psychological implications.My first objection is to the enormousfinancial burden that this extension ofthe concept of welfare will impose uponthe American people. It is estimated thatthe cost of increasing the number ofwelfare recipients from the present 10million to about 22 million under thepending bill will be $4.4 billion in thefirst full year, and that it will increasesubstantially thereafter. In 1 year wewill add 12 million new persons to thewelfare rolls\u2014most of them the verypeople who have struggled for years toavoid subjecting themselves to that veryindignity.The second point is that the presentbill would add a whole new bureaucracyunder the Social Security Administrationof the Department of Health, Education,and Welfare. As Professor Friedman soaptly pointed out In his testimony to theCommittee on Ways and Means, thewrong administrators could use this newprogram to expand their own offices andstaffs. It should also be noted that oneof the ways in which our present welfaresystem is most in need of reform is inthe bureaucracy that has grown up toadminister it. We should not now belooking for ways to expand that bureauc-racy or give it a new lease on life.My third objection to the pending leg-islation as it affects the working pooris probably the most serious of all. Here-tofore, we have always believed that workwas the proper way for a family to sup-port itself in our society. As a people,we have realized our obligations when itcame to particular hardship cases, suchas the disabled and the aged; but in gen-eral the work ethic has been an integralpart of our whole national fabric and, Ibelieve, vital to our national success.In the past, welfare programs havesought to encourage those who are un-employed to seek employment. They havebeen, at least In theory, temporary oremergency measures. To be on welfareand to receive a Government handouthas had a definite social stigma attachedto it. And this is as it should be, if we aretoencourageindividuals,capable ofdoing so, to stand on their own twofeet.Now, however, we are seeing this long-standing principle demolished. In recentyears we have witnessed a new class ofpermanent welfare recipients come intobeing and produce a second and thirdgeneration of welfare families. And to-day we -have before us a proposal thatwill even further institutionalize thisnew and tragic welfare class, this timeunder the aegis of the Federal Govern-ment.I believe such a system will be trulydemoralizing for those citizens who havelong been too proud to accept a dole fromthe Government. Those who claim thatthe proposed legislation will provide in-centives to the nonworking poor to getjobs, apparently have not looked at theother side of the coin\u2014that it will alsoprovide a disincentive for the workingpoor to stay employed.NEW FmERM.ISMMr. Chairman, the President has con-sistently expressed his belief that weshould be returning to a reinvigoratedfederalism in our Nation's domestic af-fairs.I support this viewpoint and heartilyconcur that we must redress the imbal-ance that currently exists in our State-Federal relations. We must enable theStates to determine the priority of theirown programs, so that dictation by thefaceless Federal bureaucracy is not de-termining the lives of individuals inthe Arlington Heights', Keokuk's, andSpringfield's of the Nation.The pending bill would move us in thewrong direction\u2014it would move us to-ward more Federal oontrol, and awayfrom State determination of their ownfuture programs.It seems to me that this point hBsbeen completely overlooked by those whosupport the pending bill.SUMMARYTosummarize, then, I oppose this billbecause I do not believe that it takesinto account the dangers involved inestablishing a \"guaranteed income\" forAmerican families. I am opposed to itsenactment because it does not, in myopinion, provide any genuine incentivesto work for anyone not now employed,but rather that it does the contrary. Ifurther oppose this bill because It treatsthe working poor and the nonworkingpoor unequally, and to the disadvantageof the working poor. I oppose it becauseit would bring into being a new and ex-tensive Federal administrative bureau-cacy, including the social workers neededto police the system, at a time when weare supposedly trying to reduce the sizeof government. Finally, I oppose it be-cause It represents one more step towardthe centralization of government ratherthan decentralized federalism.Mr. REID of New York. Mr. Chair-man, I rise today in strong support ofH.R. 16311, the family assistance plan.The occasions are all too rare that Ifind myself honestly excited about in-novative and original legislation on thisfloor, but today I think that we have be-fore us a truly creative proposal whichlightens not only my spirits, but also thespirits of poor people all over the-coun-try, who for too long have lived with amorass of residency requirements andbroken, fatherless families.So it is not for reasons of congres-sional courtesy that I now commend thePresident and the Committee on Waysand Means, who have respectively intro-duced a good bill, and made a good billbetter, and together worked to proposewhat may well be the most constructiveand original initiative I have seen overthe past several years.This isa positive program. It is aprogram which keeps families togetherrather than splitting them up; which than humiliating subservience; day-care centers and manpowertraining programs; and which makes ofwhat was once a stifling and even coun-terproductive system an open and pro-ductive one.it is a program through which a re-cipient can see the light at the end of thetunnel. Where all too often the life cycleof an AFDC recipient was from depend-ency to stagnation, now it can be oneof independence and dignity.The precedents that this bill sets areinvaluable\u2014first of all, it has been rec-ognized that family security is the re-sponsibility of the Federal Government,and no matter how important States'rights are, itis basically wrong for afamily in Mississippi to get $39 a monthwhile a family in New Jersey gets $263a month. Poverty happens to be na-tional in scope and in origin\u2014it shouldindeed be national in solution, and theconcepts of national minimus and a Fed-eral Income floor are progressive stepsin this direction. Second, been certifiedas deserving of Federal assistance; andthird, it is the responsibility of the Fed-eral Government to help people whowant to work but cannot, by providingday-care centers and Job training facili-ties.This is not to say that I think that theprogram, as outlined in this documentbefore me, Is perfect. I come from a Statewhich has served its poor relatively well;benefit levels in New York are presentlythe second highest in the Nation. Yet,this new plan threatens to substitute newinequities for the old. For instance, al-though New York State bears 15 per-cent of the national welfare caseload, un-der this plan it will get only about 6 per-cent of the funds. And New York City,which alone bears 10 percent of the na-tional caseload, will get only 1 percent ofthe funds\u2014a mere $40 million out ofmore than $4.4 billion In the program.It is indeed unfortunate that the for-mula as presently stated in the bill ap-pears- to penalize New York and thewealthier States which have been pro-gressive enough to Institute decent bene-fit levels. To remedy this and to guardagainst thispossible new inequity,I therefore would urge that the formulabe changed and, as the National Gov-ernors' Conference has recommendedand as both Governor Rockefeller andMayor Lindsay have recommended, that.within 3 to 5 years the Federal Govern-ment assume all' benefit costs and alladministrative costs. Federal matchingfunds should be provided for costs abovethe $1,600 floor, and they should be in- H 3194creased annually so that within 5 yearsall costs would be federalized.I am concerned also about the eligibil-ity requirement which precludes childlesscouples and single persons from receiv-ing assistance under this plan. To denybenefits to people because they are un-married, though they may be just aspoor, just as destitute, as the familiesaround them, is discriminatory. And topenalize a couple who choses not to bearchildren, though they too may be job-less and homeless, is unjust and un-reasonable. In New York State, for ex-ample, there are at least 93,000 poorpeople who would fall into these cate-gories but who are excluded from benefitsunder this bill. I would strongly urge,therefore, that the eligibility definitionsbe reconsideredto provide assistancebased on need, not on numbers.Second, I believe that the concept of,let alone the funds for, day-care facili-ties, should be broadened to be more thana welfare benefit. Families in a middle-income bracket who desire or need daycare for their children should have thisopportunity, and could pay for the serv-ices according to their ability. AlthoughI will of course support the day-care au-thorizations in this bill for 'the poor, inNew York State alone we need 300,000 to400,000 day-care places, so I warn againstlimiting our horizons in this area. I urgebroadening both the concept and thefunds to include quality educational careas well as custodial care, and funds forconstruction as well as renovation offacilities.Third, although I applaud the man-power training program and the workIncentives, statistics differ as to the num-ber of persons actually able to work, letalone the availablilty of jobs for them.It is important that the training be re-lated to the local employment market,and that a decent job will be availableupon completion of the training.Finally, I am not at all sure that amother with school-age children shouldbe required to work, as she is in this bill.If she is, then the State is in fact dictat-ing that her child must be cared for bya day-care center rather than by herself.Possibly it is old fashioned of me to sug-gest this, but I am inclined to believe thatto involuntarily deny a woman the op-tion of caring for her own child is wrong.I am under no circumstances sayingthat \"a woman's place is in the home,\"but I am saying that she should be giventhe free choice of working or staying athome, asshewould in a nonassistancefamily.I submit these reservations basically asa cautionary note that this bill in and ofitself may not end all poverty, and as areminder that we must remain open tosuggestions. Despite these reservations,however, I consider this legislation amonumentalbreakthrough.Andal- though I will continue to urge that theFederal Government take a still largerportion of the responsibility by broad-ening eligibility, authorizing greater daycare funds and employment responsibili-ties, and reconsidering the mandatorywork provision for mothers, I continueto believe that this legislation representsCONGRESSIONAL RECORD\u2014 HOUSEa vital and historic step toward liftingthe poor from dependency to dignity.Mr. ABBITT. Mr. Chairman, I rise inopposition to H.R. 16311, the Family As-sistance Act.This bill pretends to be a reform ofthe present welfare system when actuallyit opens a Pandora's box which willgreatly increase the total cost of welfarein every county and city in the UnitedStates. In my opinion, the bill now beforeus, if adopted, will be a major step towarda Federal dole system.This is a matter of much importance,and I believe that the so-called reformswhich are now being considered may infact be the most encompassing domesticlegislation to come before the Congresssince the adoption of the Social SecurityAct in the 1930's. This greatly concernsme and I am afraid that in our haste toreform the present system, we may infact be creating far greater problemsthan now exist.There is no question that the presentsystem needs reforming to some extent.We have tolerated too long certain fea-tures of the present law which tend tobenefit those who are not interested inworking, but feel that they were entitledto support from the Government. On theother hand, there are certain aspects 01the present laws which tend to penalizeneedy families simply because of the bu-reaucratic structure which does not takeinto account personal circumstances inindividual cases. I also feel that the pres-ent system does not provide for adequateinvestigation and followup in some wel-fare cases.However, I believe that the reform pro-posals now before us do very little, if anything, to change this situation. Infact, the bill incorporates most of thebad features of the present welfare sys-tem and makes provision for no improve-ment in the administrative tangle thatmakes the existing program so ineffec-tive. This simply adds a new Federallayer on top of a system that is alreadyburied in bureaucracy. The Family As-sistance Act has all of the features whichtend to foster indolence and encouragereliance on the Government. In addition,by establishing national standards, itundercuts the established patterns ofwelfare systems in many States.The thing that concerns me most isthat the Department of Health, Educa-tion, and Welfare is using unfairly theclaim that the present aid for dependentchildren program encourages the break-up of families. The truth of the matter isthat HEW is simply using this as afacade to get approval of a guaranteedannual income and once the door is openthere is no telling what the eventualramifications and cost will be.According to my understanding, thestatistics being used by HEW in supportof the family assistance program wereobtained in a survey of only 18,000 homes.This compares with approximately 50million homes in the country and such asampling would be only thirty-six one-hundredths of 1 percent of the total. Itisincredible that Congress should becalled upon to act on the basis of themeager information which has been pre- sented to us in this instance.April 16,1970I have looked over the figures suppliedby HEW and frankly am at a loss to un-deratand exactly how they have arrivedat certain statistics. It is indicated on theone hand that there are now 1.7 millionfamilies receiving AFDC funds on aregular basis.This involves approxi-mately 7 million persons. Under the pro-posed family assistance plan, the totalwouldbeincreasedto3.9million homes\u2014including the 1.7 million underAFDC\u2014and a total of 20 million persons.Still other figures which have been cir-culated show that the possible total tobe covered by the program would includenot 3.9 million homes but 5.2 millionwhich would up the total number of per-Sons to 26 million, so nobody 'knows ex-actly what the statistical situation is.Enactment of the family assistanceplan will eventually cost incalculablesums which must be made up some place.The guaranteed income Is, of course, sub-ject to rising living costs, so that it isa foregone conclusion that once theprinciple of guaranteed income is estab-lished, increases will surely follow. I amopposed to the guaranteed income assuch but also realize that the figure pro-vided in this bill is low enough so thatif the law is passed, there will be an im-mediate clamor to raise the level.I am diametrically opposed to tryingto solve problems by creating new levelsof Government bureaucracy with theidea that they may be able to grope to-ward workable solutions. We have hadfar too much of this and HEW is perhapsthe most significant example in the Gov-ernment of the inadvisability and ineffi-ciency of such attacks on preblems.It is obvious to those who have takenthe time to study the family assistanceproposal that reform of existing pro-grams is secondary to the objective ofestablishing a guaranteed income. I amopposed to this and feel that the vastmajority of our people are against it.HEW is merely trying to camouflage itsreal purposes by putting forth the ideathat this will encourage families to staytogether. I do not believe that any actionby the Government per se can be calledthe primary reason for the breakup offamilies. This bill would add to the Gov-ernment welfare rolls vast millions ofpeople and establish the precedent thatthe Government will guarantee to them abasic income. No one in authority seemsto be able to give any idea as to howmany people will be involved, how muchthe cost will be, how many more admin-istrative personnel will be required, orwhere the road will eventually lead.For this reason, I feel that itis a mistake to go into a program of thiskind without more painstaking study byCongress. Past experience has shownthat we cannot rely too much on thestatistical information provided by HEWand we need only the recent experiencewith medicare to cause us to pause andraise questions as to where this all willlead.It seems to me that we have gone farafield in this country as to our under-standing of the role of the Governmentin relation to its citizens. The Govern-ment was never established to take careof the people but to simply provide a April 16,1970climatewherein its citizens may havethe freedom to make a living and goabout their daily pursuits without gov-ernmental interference. We have traveledalready too far down the road towardsocialism and the establishment of a dolesystem would be the final major steptoward the completion of the socialisticpattern. Obviously there are many goodfeatures to the welfare program and thepresent bill makes Improvements In aidto the blind and other handicapped per-sons, child care and certain Incentives to-ward manpower training, and so forth.I am afraid, however, that taken on bal-ance the bill before us would create moreproblems than It would solve and willestablish patterns which will be difficultto reverse once It is obvious that they arewrong.One of the main failings of the Fed-eral Government Is that we too oftenthink of sdlving problems In terms ofcreating bureaucracy and making Fed-eral aid available. In the instance of pub-lic welfare my feeling Is that too muchmoney has been spent to accoxrpUsh toolittle good and that along the way wehave contributed to the establishment ofa pattern whereby many Individuals tendto rely on public support rather than torecognize their own responsibilities. I seenothing in the present bill which wouldreverse that trend but, in fact, feel thatit is likely to be accelerated under Itsterms.Mr. HANLEY. Mr. Chairman, we havebefore us today one of the most far-reaching pieces of legislation to be de-bated In the 91st Congress, the familyassistance plan. I am pleased that weare moving in this direction, but I amconcerned at the procedure under whichthe billIs proceeding. While I am ingeneral agreement with the conceptscontained in the bill, I was hopeful thatthe measure could have been presentedto us under an open rule permittingamendments. It was for this reason thatI voted against the closed rule yesterday.I intend to vote for the bill on finalpassage while at the same time express-ing the hope and the belief that theSenate will refine certain of the provi-sions with which I am not In whole-hearted agreement.For a moment now, I would like to dis-cuss a few of the more important fea-tures of the bill.The President proposes a floor of $1,600income for a family of four, paid en-tirely by the Federal Government. Ad-ditional payments to families with no in-come at all would be made by thoseStates where current benefit levels ex-ceed $1,600. For families where a mem-ber is working, the first $720 per yearearned incomewillnot be countedagainst the $1,600 floor. In ad1itIon, onlyone dollar of each two earned over the$720 will be taken from the floor pay-ment. For the family of four, whenearned Income reaches $4,000, the Fed-eral payment would no longer be paid.I am pleased with this provision be-cause it will represent a substantial im-provement in the lives of the poor andthe indigent in some States, but I do notbelieve that the inherent disparity inbenefits among the States will slow orCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014HOUSEalter the trend toward uprooting and mi-gration. I am pleased that the eligibilityfeatures for the family assistance planwill apply nationwide, and I hope thatthe bill is amended in the Senate to closeeven more the gap which exists in bene-fits among the States.I regret that the President's programdoes not contain a new proposal to strengthen the hand of the welfareagency in obtaining support paymentsfrom deserting fathers, but two provi-sions should help to cut down on deser-tions:Removal of the \"man in thehouse\" rule and imposition on the desert-ing parent or spouse of a financial obli-gation equal to the amount of Federalassistance paid to his or her family as aresult of the abandonment. This firstprovision is a humane and stabilizingfeature because we are removing the in-centive which exists for a father to de-sert his family when he is unable to pro-vide for them and when his mere pres-ence is a stumbling block to the family'sreceipt of public assistance. It replacesthe incentive to desert with an incentiveto find work or accept job training. Thesecond provision moves in the directionof insuring that the Government is notpicking up the tab for someone who Iscapable of picking it up himself.One of the more negligent points inthe bill before us, and one which I amsure the Senate will attempt to revise inits consideration, Is the fact that the leg-islation does not move in the direction ofproviding relief for State and local tax-payers by assuming a greater Federalshare of the costs of the program in themore progressive States like New York.The Nixon program requires the Statesto supplement the income of welfarefamilies in the amount which exceeds thebasic $1,600 up to the level of welfarepaid in that State at the beginning of1970. Unfortunately, the bill provides that the Federal Government will payonly 30 percent of the cost of these sup-plernentary payments, and no Federalassistance will be available where theState makes a supplemental payment tothe working poor. In my judgment, thisprovision of the Nixon program offersNew Yorkers no relief to speak of fromthe burden of welfare. The bill has to beamended In the Senate to provide for amuch larger share of the supplementalbenefits and aid should be available forthe working poor.Mr. Chairman, my remarks today, ofnecessity, could not cover all of the fea-tures in this complex bill, owing to thetime element. I am going to vote for thebill because, on balance, it is a good one.I did, however, want to take this oppor-tunity to address the attention of my col-leagues to some of the more obvious defi-ciencies In the measure and at the sametime urge our colleagues over in theSenate to seriously consider amendatorylanguage.Mr. OT'FINGER. Mr. Chairman, I riseInsupport of H.R. 16311, the Family As-sistance Act of 170. While I believe thatthis bill should have been brought to thefloor under an open rule to allow us tooffermuch-needed amendments, the measure Is a step in the right directionof reform of our drastically Ineffective,H3195inequitable, and misdirected welfare sys-tem. I have been advocating welfare re-form since early In my congressionalcareer, and I am gratified that we at lasthave a vehicle to enable us to carryforward the necessary struggle to elimi-nate hunger and poverty in the UnitedStates.Our existing welfare system shouldhave been discarded long ago. It placesrecipients in the awful position of havingto refuse employment that would reducetheir meager Income from public assist-ance. It encourages dependency and cre-ates generational cycles on relief rolls.It breaks up families in areas where\"man in the house\" rules have restrictedeligibility. And it encourages the poor toflock to overcrowded cities where welfarepayments are higher. When a family offour receives $44 a month in Mississippiand could be eligible for $264 a monthin New Jersey, who could resist the im-pulse to emigrate?It Is heartening to witness the publicsupport for overhaul of public assistance.Significant elements of the business com-munity, the Presidential commission onincome maintenance, key figures In theadministration, public-service agenciessuch as the Urban Coalition, the Na-tional Welfare Rights Organization, andmany, many more have lent their back-ing to this effort, and while the FamilyAssistance Act falls short of what needsto be done, it deserves our support be-cause it will incorporate many desirableprinciples into the Nation's public assist-ance programs.I specifically endorse the bill's empha-sis on jobs and job training for all able-bodied welfare recipients who have nosmall children to care for; the establish-ment of minimum Federal standards foreligibility and expanded Federal financ-ing and administration; complete Fed-.eral funding of day-care centers forworking mothers; a floor on income forthe very poor; assistance to the workingpoor whose Income falls well below thepoverty level; and a minimum guaran-teed payment for aged, blind, and dis-abled individuals who have no other in-come. These Initiatives embody much-needed principles if we are to break thepervasiveness of poverty which so de-bases the moral posture of a Nation witha gross national product nearing $1 tril-lion a year.I was, however, among those who re-quested an open rule on this legislationto give all Members of this body a fullopportunity to add still further Innova-tions and Increases needed to make thistruly a welfare reform bill.While the Family Assisance Act doesprovide for greater Federal involvement,it will stifi allow for variations in theamounts of assistance paid by differentStates and will, therefore, not completelydiscourage the migration of the poor tocities like New York where public welfareburdens distort the entire municipalbudget. Equity demands full Federalfunding and administration of public as-sistance, and we will not have a trulyworkable and adequate system until thisbasic step Is taken.Further, the princIple of an incomeftoor Is a major breakthrough and a long H 3196overdue reform. But how any family offour in the United States can live withdignity on $1,600 eludes me completely.Instead of testing the water with our toe,we ought to act on ourrealization thateven the official poverty borderline of $3,-720 Is not adequate in most sections ofthe country to maintain a decent stand-ard of living. In New Y\u00e7rk $5,500 wouldbe a more reasonable and realistic mini-mum, and we should notblanch at sucha positive move towardsocial justice. Forthose who cry that we are establishing anew welfare population, wehave manyalternatives to prevent such an occur-rence. It is my conviction that all menwant the satisfaction and dignity of self-supporting employment, and by expand-ing the job-training provisions of thisprogram, and also creating Jobs if we must, we can bring this principle intooperation. Thus the income floor will bebut a springboard to a higher goal.The Family Assistance Act does notpenalize the working individual for earn-ing minimal outside income, but the dis-regard amounts to only $720, beyondwhich 50 to 67 percent of earnings wouldbe deducted from the person's income.Surely there Is no equity in levying thissteep a tax on family heads trying tosupport dependents on $2,320 a year, anda built-indisincentiveto seek furtherwork will be embodied In the program.This is the same fault in existing welfarerules, and by not deleting these penaltiesat low-income levels, we will once againencourage the search for hidden incomeand other subterfuges plaguing the reliefsystem today. One of the most interest-ing proposals I have seen on the work-Incentive problem has been developedand advanced by a distinguished andsuccessful New York businessman, Mr.Leonard M. Greene, who has devotedconsiderable time and effort to remov-ing the stigma of poverty from our na-tional life. Mr. Greene's admirable planIs labeled \"fair share,\" and in the beliefthat Congress should give full and fairconsideration to this solution, I appendMr. Greene's position to my remarks. Wesimply must remove all government bar-riers and penalties on the working poorin the form of excessive taxation of mea-ger earnings, and fair share deals elo-quently with a remedy for this practice.Mr. Chairman, I am also perplexedthat HR. 16311 excludes childless couplesand single people from public assistance.This Is a major shortcoming of the billand belles the reform label. A poor personis a poor person, and by passage of thislegislation we shall have failed to helpuntold numbers of the disadvantaged,while at the same time we will place apremium on family size at a time whenwe should rather be discouraging the ac-celerating growth of our population.There can be no justification for penallz-lng people for not bearing children.Furthermore, while stress has beenplaced on the work-Incentive provisionsof this bill, let us not lose sight of thefact that over 90 percent of present wel-fare recipients are aged, blind, disabled,dependent children, and mothers caringfor preschool children. With national Un-employmeflt\u00b0zooming to 4.4 per cent, weneed to be mindful of the ilmitations andCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEnot imply that we will force mothersto work. Certainly no able-bodied per-son should be allowed to refuse decentemployment, and this bill includes saf e-guards to prevent exploitation of theemployable poor, but we need to bewareof allowing punitive action to intrudeon our legitimate effort to ensure a lifeof dignity, with adequate housing andnutrition,foreveryAmerican.The needs of children must be kept upper-most .ln mind as we attempt to upliftthose in need of help.In addition to raising family supportlevels, Mr. Chairman, we must increasethe guarantee for the blind, disabled, theaged, from the proposed $110 to at least$150 a month. The staggering rise In thecost of living is a burden on most, butnone more so than those on fixed in-comes and unable to work. Age eligibilityshould be reduced to 60 for men and 55for women, and cost-of-living clausesseem only fair. Cost-of-living Increasesare coming to be the recognized neces-sities in all wage determinations, Mr.Chairman, and we should include themIn the overall provisions of the publicassistance program.Mr. Chairman, we have today an op-portunity to begin\u2014and it is only a be-ginning\u2014to strike out in new directionsin our society. We have among us 15million malnourished, 30 million poor,and 77 millIon deprived people. We havethe worst welfare system of all the de-veloped nations of the world. Ten coun-tries have lower infant mortality rates,and 15 have higher literacy rates thanthe United States. National pride andhuman decency impel us to move boldlyto eradicate the flaws in our social fabric.We must compete not only in armamentsand technology and trade, but In thefar more fundamental reforms which willimprove the quality of the lives of allof our people. Instead of taking one smallstep as men, let us take that giant leapfor mankind.The article referred to folows:FAIR WELFARE(By Leonard M. Greene)THE PROBLEMRecently, the widowed mother of five chil-dren living in Westchester County, New York,on funds provided by our present wetlfaresystemwasdelightedwhenhereldestdaughter came home and announced proudlythat she had ,obtained a Job at the checkoutcounter of a supermarket.The family's joy was short-lived. It quicklydiscovered that with a wage earner in thehome, welfare payments were reduced. Whensimple costs such as lunches and bus fareswere subtracted from the total, the familyhad less moneys to live on than it had hadbefore. To be of real help at home, the dis-appointed youngster was forced to resign.The unhappy episode is a tragic example ofhow \"second generation\" welfare cases arecreated and how abysmally another \"NobleExperiment\" in America has failed because ofa lack of Imaginative planning.WELFARE REFORMIn his current proposals for welfare re-form, President Nixon has taken note of this\"incentive pitfall.\" Reactions of leaders invarious fields to his suggested improvementsrange from high to extremely faint praise.Certainly, almost any change from the utterchaos of the present system which sees wel-fare rolls zooming upward during years ofApril 16,1970national prosperity is welcome. A \"step inthe right direction\" thus far has been thefavored summation.But is a step enough? I, for one, and a lotof other people with me. do not think so. Forexample, the new \"welfare reform\" still con-tains the same fatal flaw that doomed theoriginal high-minded concept of help for thepoor\u2014it does not provide the vital full in-centive that inspires a person to lift himselfup and improve his lot in life.Under the new plan, the basic Federalbenefit for a family of four would be $1,600per year;$500 for each of the first twofamilymembers and$300per member thereafter. So far, so good. But here comesour old pitfall beneath a fresh camouflage.According to the official \"Welfare Reform FactSheet\" issued by the United States Govern-ment, 'Benefits would be reduced by 50 percent as earnings increase above $720 peryear.\"A 50-PERCENT TAX FOR THE POORIn other words, a welfare recipient wholabored to make $61 a month would Imme-diately leap Into a 50 per cent tax bracket!Figuratively, he would be rubbing elbowswith highly-successful doctors, lawyers andbusiness executives. Undoubtedly, his elbowswould be considerably more frayed but hewould be in that relatively exclusive corn-pa\u00f1y nonetheless.Ills incent;ve to earn that extra dollarmust evaporate by 50 percent according tothe \"law\" of human nature. This \"law\" hasnot yet been repealed despite the hopefuladministration declaration, \"With such in-centives, most recipients who can work willwant to work. This is part of the Americancharacter.\"It is also part of the \"American character\"to expect to be fully rewarded for one'sefforts.That Is why I propose a complete new planthat we have named \"Fair Share\" whichabolishes welfare altogether, wipes out theenormous bureaucratic machine that admin-isters it, and, most important, gives everyAmerican citizen that spiritual spark, thatincentive drive which says, \"I can do better,and my efforts will be fully rewarded.\"ABOLISH WELFAREHow can this be done? Remember thatthe welfare problem In this country is im-mense and the situation is growing moreexplosive daily. Bold, drastic measures rem-iniscent of the early days of the New Dealthat met the Great Depression head-on mustbe takeS. Abolishing welfare sounds as out-rageous as closing the banks did then. Butthat courageous strategy worked and we whobelieve in \"Fair Share\" are confident thatthis equally forceful and daring plan alsowill succeed where any halfway measure, anypatchwork stopgap is doomed before It starts.FAIR SHAREBriefly, this is how the \"Fair Share\" plancan replace welfare, providing the poor withthe necessities of life While at the same timeopening wide the door of opportunity andinviting them to better their standard ofliving.Poor or not, every citizen (and that in-cludes President Nixon, the butcher, thebaker and you and me) would receive ataxable allowance. For example, Congressmight set this figure at $900 for an adultand $400 for a child. This would give a fam-ily of four an annual \"Fair Share\" incomeof $2,600.Disbursement of these \"Fair Share\" fundswould be and combined with ourexisting internal revenue service system.A 100-PERCENT ENCOURAGEMENT TO WORKOur present welfare system offers the re-cipIent 100 per cent discouragement againstworking. The proposed\"welfarereform\"still offers 50 per cent work discouragcment.Iii my opinion, that remains fataUy high April 16, 1970 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSE H3197and it will not produce the miracle we needto solve our problem. \"Pair Share\" offers,Instead, 100 per cent encouragement to takea job,andthat is the kind of booster powerwe must have If we are ever to get thisAmerican society-saving missile off the pad.Let's look at a table that shows how muohbetter off a family of four would be under\"Pair Share\" than It would be under the re-form propoeal per cent 1005,520The recipientof reformed welfare whosomehow fought his way to an annual in-come of $3,920 despite the 50 per cent benefitdeduction on everything he made over $720would at that point have $3930 In his pocket.He would have been dragging a 50 per centball and chain ever since he passed the $720mark and now would be recelvthg no benefitsat all for his tremendous effort.But consider a recipient who adds his \"Fair Share\" of $2,800 to earnings of $3,920to support his family of four. He has $6,520.Assume he takes the ordinary 10 per cent de-duction plus $2,400 for members of his familyand pays a surcharge of 20 per cent as all tax-payers would be required to do to financethe program. At present rates, he would re-turn to the government $635.47 In taxes andetlU have $5,884.53 In his pocket.He would have had full incentive to climbthe ladder of earning power because as heclimbed, his spendable income would haverisen with him rung by rung.REDUCE TAXES FOR MOSTIt will not be until the higher brackets arereached that the \"Pair Share\" allowance Iscanceled out by Increasing Income taxes,Thoee wIth low Income receive the greatestbenefit which goes hand In hand with in-centive to earn.And because \"Pair 8hare\" both gives andit takes\u2014it gives in allowance and takes Intaxes\u2014It will pay for itself; these taxes plusthe money saved by scrapping the bureau-cratic anti-poverty programs that year would balancethe \"Fair Share\" payments.Admittedly, because of the 20 per cent In-come tax surcharge on present rates neededto get \"Fair Share\" started, persons in thehighest brackets would at first pay morethan they are paying now. But eventuallythey too, would benefit as America recoveredits economic health and more of the peoplewould be in a position to contribute taxesand the tax rates could be lowered,CHECK ESP'LATIONMillions of persons now on welfare willInstead be encouraged to seek Jobs. Theywould begin to fit again Into society, to per-form services, to manufacture articles forsale. The Gross National Product could risedramatically to a point where the value ofthe dollar would no longer be attacked bythe threat of inflation,Gone forever Into the limbo of unhappyeconomic experiments would be the cost ofwelfare workers who are ml8ualng their tal-ents to examine shoes, poke mattresses andscan cupboards to determine if a person Isentitled to relief. Gone with them would bethe ghettos born of the rush to be where thehandout is biggest.\"FairShare\"protectsevery Americancitizen from destitution simply because he Iaan American citizen, He would be able to holdhis head high, to put his heart, his mind,and his hands to the business of earning abetter living.Mr, ROUDEBUSH. Mr. Chairman, wehave before the House today welfare re-form legislation which aims to revampthe chaotic welfare system in the Na-tion.I certainly concur that there is ampleneed for improvement in our welfare pro-gram which has grown like Topsy andhas placed a very heavy tax burden onour citizens,All Americans share the concern andsympathy for the less fortunate in oursociety, but at the same time it Is diffi-cult for our productive and hard-workingcitizens to accept a system that seemsto actually encourage indolence and de-pendence on assistance even though em-ployment and the ability to work Is avail-able.We are all willing to assist those whoby physical disability or by economicalcircumstances cannot find work. But anew plan that will, according to someestimates, nearly double the number ofpersons receiving welfare does not ap-pear to offer reform, but instead seemsto be an expansion of an already pon-derous and expensive program.Therefore, rather than further com-pound the problems of the present pro-gram, it Is my intention to oppose thislegislation,I do not think the Federal Oovern-ment should be the encourager and mul-tiplier of the welfare \"way of life\" inthis Nation,Our citizens will never turn away fromthose honestly and sincerely in need ofassistance, but to tax our productive citi-zenry exorbitantly to prolong and ex-pand an already misused program, Is notgood legislation.Mr. ANNUNZIO. Mr. Chairman, manyof us have long looked forward to theopportunity to contribute toward thepassage of basic welfare reform legis-lation. Therefore, I would like to com-mend those who have paved the way fortoday's vote on HR. 16311, which willmake very important structural changesIn our present welfare system,In particular, I want to call attentionto the contribution of the HonorableWILBUR MILLS, whose role as chairmanof the Committee on Ways and Meanswas crucial to the development of theproposal which Is now before us. Thecommittee, under the leadership of Mr.MILLS, worked both quickly and success-fully In studying the proposal made bythe administration and making amend-ments to strengthen It. The chairman Isto be commended for his very construc-tive leadership for welfare reform.The bill before us Is a good one. Itdoes not please everyone, but surely wemust recognize that welfare legislationnever will please everyone, whatever itcontains. It does, however, go very far Inthe direction of rationalizing our presentIrrational system, It also introduces amuch-needed element of equity Into de-termining eligibility for\u2014and the amountof\u2014welfare assistance which familiesthroughout the country are entitled toreceive.I have been concerned about the grow-ing crisis in welfare for some time. InAugust1967,Cook County began agrowth in the number of recipients of aidtofamilieswith dependent childrenwhich was unprecedented, and which hasnot yet begun to slow. The number offamilies receiving AFDC In Cook Countyincreased nearly 20 percent in the lastyear. Overall, the county now includesabout 380,000 individuals who are re-ceiving some kind of cash welfare assist-ance. We now have slightly more thantwo-thirds of all the welfare recipients inthe entire State of Illinois.What is distressing about all this is notonly the numbers, but the human miserybehind the numbers. A substantial num-ber of those now on welfare, both thosenew to Chicago and old-time residents,might never have had to ask for assist-ance, or might have worked their wayoff by now, if we had a system whichhelped them at the time and In the waythat they needed it.We knOw that our public welfare sys-tem, although created to promote thegeneral welfare, has in some ways under-mined it. It has\u2014too often\u2014provided toolittle assistance for those in It has\u2014too often\u2014promoted in-equities beth for welfare recipients andfor taxpayers. And, finally, it has failedto provide assistance and incentives de-signed to promote family stability andindependence.H.R. 16311, the Fan-illy Asslst.ance Act.is not a cure-all for the problems ofpoverty in this country. However, it con-stitutes a major departure from previouspolicy, and moves very definitely in thedirection of providing a national floor forwelfare payments, removing the discrimi-nation against families in which thefather Is present and working, and to-ward uniformity In eligibility require-ments.The bill would provide at least $1,600 ayear for a needy family of four, regard-less of where in the United States It lived,This basic payment would be supple-mented In several ways, depending on thefamily'scircumstances. The workingpoor, who would be eligible for assist-ance for the lrst time, would, of course,supplement the payment through theirearnings. Other families would, in allexcept a few States, be eligible for Statesupplementary payments. And all poorfamilies would be eligible for food stampsto add to their cash Income.In addition to providing a minimumstandard of assistance payments, theproposal contains very promising provi-sions for work Incentives. The provisionfor dlsregertilng certain earned incomeshould give recipients strong economicIncentiveto maximizetheir Incomesthrough enployment.I believe the manpower training fea-tures of the bill will also be of Immeas-urable valuetothose who need anopportunity to Improve their employmentpotential, In Cook County we have hadextensive pi'ograms for training recipi-ents of AFDC In the past, but our effortsshould be manifestly more effective underhls new legislation, The bill makes pos-sible a mobilization of all kinds of servicesto assist individuals In training for andfinding jobs, and we know from experi-ence that It Is this kind of comprehensive H 3198approach which welfare recipients oftenneed.Perhaps the most valuable of the sup-portive services which the bill providesis for expanded child care services. Manypeople fail to realize that a large numberof mothers on welfare are already work-ing, but are haunted by the constantworry that their children are not beingproperly cared for. Many more motherswant to work, but have refrained fromseeking employment because they could-not arrange for appropriate child care.The Family Assistance Act would as-sure that all mothers who participate Inemployment or training under the familyassistance plan would have appropriatechild care. It is estimated that 450,000child care openings would be providedunder the bill, including 150,000 for qual-ity preschool care and 300,000 for after-school care.The bill would also provide a greatlyimproved program of assistance for theaged, blind, and disabled. These people,who are the most disadvantaged of all inour society, would be assured a minimumwelfare standard of $110 for each Indi-vidual, or $220 for a couple. This stand-ard, which was Increased substantiallyby the Ways and Means Committeeabove the administration's proposal, willmake it possible for many more Ameri-cans to live with some measure of de-cency and dignity.Another major improvement in the billis the strengthened role of the FederalGovernment in the administration ofwelfare assistance. The Federal pay-ments for family assistance recipientswould be made by a new Federal agencywhich could draw upon other Federalresources to assist It In making eligi-bility and payment determinations. Forexample, the vast record and computerresources of the Social Security Admin-Istration could be used to check earn-ings statements for purposes of familyassistance.By having the plan administered bythe Federal Government, we can end thevery wide discrepancies which have ex-isted in the past in welfare determina-tions by the States. We can introduce amuch needed uniformity, and a greaterassurance that poor families will be treated In a dignified and fair way.The Ways and Means Committee alsoimproved the likelihood of having Fed-eral administration of the State supple-mentary payments and of the adult pro-grams by providing 100 percent Federalfunding for the costs of administrationIn those States which make agreementswith the Federal Government for Fed-eral administration. This is another steptoward equity and rationality in publicwelfare.Mr. Chairman, the Members of theHouse of Representatives, Republicansand Democrats alike, cannot lose the op-portunity now before us to legislate basicwelfare reform. We have castigated thepresent system for years. We know Itsfailings and weaknesses. We know thatwe cannot in good conscience let it growand fester, and further contribute to oursocial problems.H.R. 16311 offers a new and promisingalternative. It does, as I have already out-CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSElined, accomplish some very importantreforms: First, It eliminates discrimina-tion against working poor families; sec-ond, it offers incentives to training, andemployment; third, it establishes Federalstandards and requirements to promoteequity among the States: and fourth, itprovides new Federal machinery to im-prove welfare administration.I believe this bill, as reported by theCommittee on Ways and Means, consti-tutes the kind of reform we have longbeen seeking. I strongly support its pas-sage.Mr. LLOYD.Mr.Chairman, our presentwelfare system is not succeeding andneeds change. This Is a generally ac-cepted judgment and is supported by amargin of more than 6 to 1 by those citi-zens In my district who have respondedto my inquiry. The question before usnow is whether the costly changes pro-posed by the legislation before us consti-tute the proper solution. Actually, no onecan say. Each of us must be guided bywhat seems to us to be the best evidenceand by our own conscience in the matteras influenced by our individual search.For our free system with expandingopportunity to survive, It is necessarythat it be responsibly bulwarked by prop-er recognition of and aid 'to those who, through misfortune or circumstancesgenerally beyond their control, are livingor raising families under conditions 'ofexceptional poverty and wretchedness.Our present welfare system Is fallingand getting worse. Particularly is thistrue in the case of families with growingchildren where the head of the family Iseither unemployable or failing to becharged with clear responsibility to go towork. Cost of our present system Is about$4.2 billion annually. The cost of thissystem which is generally acknowledgedto be falling in Important ways is pro-jectcd to rise to $12 billion annually Inthe next 5 years, according to the De-partments of Labor and Health, Edi,tca-tion, and Welfare. This Congress is facedwith the challenge to act to acknowledgethis failure of the present welfare sys-tem and to adopt a system which hasprospects for success rather than thecertainty of continued failure. It is timewe stopped going downhill and that wefind a path that goes up the hill, and wemust run the risk, in my opinion, thatthe uphill path will be a costly and diffi-cult one, But at least we will have thesatisfaction of trying to fight our wayup rather than contInuing the easierroad down.This decision to decide on what I con-sider to be the upward leading path hasnot been an easy one for me or perhapsmost of us, because the difficulties of thiscourse are plain to see and we cannoteven be sure such a course actually is anupward one. I am under no illusions. Thisplan, too, may end in failure. The Nixonadministration has, ,however, conductedexhaustive research and has recom-mended this course without reservation.The greatly respected Ways and MeansCommittee of this House has conductedits own inquiries In depth and urgentlyrecommends this course to us. We haveample testimony and ample evidencefrom qualified witnesses that this alter-April 16,1970native upon which we vote today will inactual fact result In substantial transi-tion to work where idleness now exists.In making this difficult decision, I havebeen mQst mindful of an experience Ihad during the recent Easter recess. Inanswer to an inquiry in March of my con-stituents regarding their feelings on thisissue, I received a letter from a citizenof middle to modest income, living In aclean and unpretentious neighborhood inwhich he stated that he and his wifehad worked hard at unskilled and skilledlabor for the past 23 years. He said thathe was not able to give his childreneverything they perhaps needed, but thatas a result of his work and that of hiswife, they were getting along and payingtheir bills without having much of any-thing to save except the payment ontheir mortgage. But they were living indignity and passing' this pride down totheir family. He said it was his view andthat of his associates and neighbors insimilar circumstances that it was unfairto them to add to their tax burdens inorder to make increased welfare pay-ments to those who were not willing tomake similar efforts to work and to takecare of themselves.It was a very impressive letter to meand I wrote in reply asking that I mightmeet and talk to him during the recess.While home in my district, he invitedme to his home one night, and there Igathered with his neighbors and friends.I am a Republican. This was a Demo-cratic neighborhood. I did not ask themtheir politics, but I assume they werepredominantly Democratic, since thoseare the clear figures of the district. Theywere not concerned with politics, how-ever. In this room full of neighbors andfriends, they were all devoted to takingcare of their own needs. All hard, honestworkers on modest income, and everyone of these good citizens, without ran-cor and with good will, told me theybelieved an increase In welfare paymentswould increase the desire of many of theirneighbors to remain or go on welfare,and add unfairly to the burden of thoseself-reliant citizens who desired to workand to raise their children in an atnnos-phere of work and dignity.Memory of' that evening has remainedstrongly with me making it even moredifficult to reach the decision to votefor this bill. I can only say to them thatmy decision, is based on the fact that Ibelieve we have more chance of puttingthese idle people to work under this billbefore us today which demands regis-tration for work and willingness to workat suitable emoloyment as a conditionto receiving public welfare.As to the charge by others that thisrepresentsa \"guaranteed annual in-come,\" my reply is that in my view thislegislation reoresents a conditional pay-ment, conditioned unon willingness towork. As to a guarantee to those unableto work and unable to take care of them-selves. we already have this type of guar-anteed payment in every one of the 50States, and by this bill we are merelyacknowledging that conditions of pov-erty and wretchedness exist and we areraising our priorities in relation to aidand encouragement to this unfortunatesegment of our society, and as I stated April 16, 1970atthe beginning, we cannot expect ahealthy capitalistic, free system to sur-vive if we do not establish this bulwarkagainst actual misery.The most expensive part of this legis-lation is the addition of the working poorto the welfare rolls. To the annual mini-mum guaranteed payment of $1,600 peryear to a family of four\u2014$500 for eachparent, $300foreach child\u2014we are ad-ding the right to work and earn moneyup to $720 per year. Beyond that, 50 centsof each welfare dollar is deducted foreach $1 earned, and the complete transi-tion from welfare to self-reliance is reached at $3,920. This is not a perfectformula, but to allow the recipient toretain more than 50 cents would addImproperly to costs of the program, andto require him to deduct more from hiswelfare woulddiscouragehim fromworking. I am not satisfied with thisformula, but I know none better and wewill have to learn from experience inorder to make needed corrections.To allow and to encourage the welfarerecipient to work o supplement his in-come seems only civilized to me and wemust face the Initial cost of carrylngthewelfare recipient in order to promote himto self sufficiency.There is widespread impression amongmany of my friends that the welfare rollsre filled with lazy persons who would notwork. There. are some, but the provedpercentage is very low. Of all those onwelfare, the figure for these individualsin my State, for example, is 6.7 percent.For those \"lazy persons who would notwork,\" this legislation has an answer,which is \"work, or else.\" This applies tofemales who are heads of families andwhose children are above 6 years of age. Our present welfare program containsno such ultimatum.In conclusion, our present system is an economic and social disaster. If It con-tinues unchanged, it can only lead tohigher costs, more broken homes, andhopeless numbers of otherwise employ-able people living off Government wel-fare.. The family assistance plan offers an alternative\u2014an alternative which I be-lieve I should support as Congressmanfrom my Second Utah District, not be- cause it offers a sure solution, but be-cause It offers what my personal researchand instincts lead me to believe is a bet- ter way, with reasonable hope of less cost in the long run than the present pro- gram, and with reasonable hope thatthere will result greater proportionateemployment and less proportiona de- pendence on Government.Mr. BRADEMAS. Mr. Chairman, I take this minute to read the text of the following letter to me .dated March 16, 1970, from the distinguished former Sec- retary of Health, Education, and Wel-fare, the Honorable WilburJ. Cohen, now dean of the School of Education at the University of Michiganand a recog-nized authority on welfareprograms.As sponsor of HR. 13520, the Compre- hensive Preschool Educationand Child Day Care Act, which isnow under con-sideration in the Commjttmon Educa-tion and Labor, I asked Mr. Cohen tocomment on the relationship between that bill and the daycare provisions ofthe bill under considerationtoday, HR.Wn.uuz 3.COHRN,Dean.Mr.Chairman, I am glad to say thatthe distinguished chairman of the Com-mittee on Ways and Means, the gentle-man from Arkansas (Mr. MILLS) hasread Mr. Cohen's letter and has advisedme that he agrees with the interpretationin this letter on the relationship betweenthe two bills.Mr. ICHORD. Mr. Chairman, like every other Member In this Chamber, I am highly discontented with the operationsof the present welfare program. Duringthis debate, several Members have char-acterizedthe present program as a \"mess.\" With that characterization, i wholeheartedly agree. The present pro- gram has had the effect of destroying thewill to work on the part of many welfarerecipients. We need a newprogram\u2014anew direction.I believe that this legislation is an earnest effort on the part of the majorityof the members of the Committee on Ways and Means to combinea \"carrotand stick\" approach to get welfare re- cipient.s who are able to work off the\"welfare rolls\" and on the \"payrolls.\"There are many provisions In the legis-lation which would lead me to vote for the same. The establishment of a nation-wide floor isdefinitely desirable. The\"carrot\" is provided in the form of in- centives to work. The \"stick\" Is present In the form of requirementson the partof certain recipients to either work or train to work. However, when I examine the specific provisions of the bill, I must conclude that the \"stick\" has not been fashioned sufficiently strong to reach the objectives so meritoriously sought.

I heartily commend thePresident for his efforts. Indeed, we aretold that this legislation will get peopleoff of welfare and put them to wQrk. Weare told that it will eliminate the seem-ingly paradoxical \"incentives\" of thepresent program, which teem to encour-age the breakup of families, to penalizeindustriousness, and to create dissensionby arbitrarily providIng assistance tosome of the needy while denying It toothers.If these benefits will be realized by thepassage of H.R. 16311, then It will trulybe a landmark piece of legislation. ButI would ask this particular question: Howdo we know? A small number of similarbut limited programs have been tested,but much of the data from these experi-ments is inconclusive, I suggest that a full-fledged pilot program should be In-stituted so that the family assistanceplan can be adeauately tested and studiedfor at least a year, in one ormore Stateswith major cities, before we commit our- selves to a program that might create a welfare mess greater than that withwhich we are now confronted.Many questions must be answered, andin my judgment the answers will be avail-able only after we out the family assist-ance plan Into existence on a smallerscale and examine the results. To whatextent might the Family Assistance Act H 3200undermine the work motivation of themillions of new recipients\u2014the workingpoor\u2014who will be added to the welfarerolls? Does this bill's implicit tac rateon other income really offer the bestwork incentive for the least cost? Willthe employment and training programsin H.R. 16311 really be effective In inov-Ing people off the welfare rolls, or willthey, like the similar provisions In pres-ent law, prove to be little more than ex-pensive window dressing? As a practicalmatter, will the mandatory work provi-sions be effective, or will recipients whoare so inclined to be able to evade them?Will this bill help to heal whatever ani-mosity there may now be between wel-fare recipients and the working poor,who are Ineligible for welfare? Or is itpossible that any such animosity will bedeepened when both groups are eligiblefor welfare but the working poor are ex-cluded from State supplemental pay-ments and from the benefits of the med-icaid program?Indeed, will a guaranteed annual in-come actually promote work? What re-quirements will be necessary to clarifythe term \"suitable\" employment? In thistime of financial stress, do we have theresources to find the program adequate-ly? Are adequate provisions available toaccount for the different standards ofliving in urban and rural areas? And,perhaps most Important, what will thislegislation cost the Government In 5years, or 10, or 20? I raise this last ques-tion because of Our unpleasant experi-ence with the skyrocketing costs of themedicare program. According to the Bu-reau of the Budget, the cost to the Fed-eral Government of \"providing or fi-nancing medical services\" has Increasedan estimated 1,000 percent since 1966,accounting for anproximately 15 percentof the entire increased Federal expendi-ture since that time.The immediate cost of this programalso concerns me. It Is estimated thatduring the first full year of operation,the family assistance plan will cost theFederal Government an additional $4billion, above and beyond the currentFederal expenditure of $4.2 billion an-nually. An additional $4 billion of spend-ing by the Federal Government In whatstill might be an overheated economywill not help ease our financial crisis. ItIs estimated that under the current wel-fare system costs will rise to $8.8 billionby 1975, double the present outlay, andI think we need to be very certain thata program of \"workfare\" will lift peopleoff the welfare rolls to avoid the possibil-ity that this program, too, might costtwice as much In 5 years.Let mestressexactlywhat mythoughts are. Perhaps the Family As-sistance Act Is workable and practical,and it certainly is Innovative. To takesuch a giant step\u2014at least in Its presentform\u2014demands In my judgment muchmore documentation and many morefacts than we no whave at hand. I sug-gest, therefore, that this Congress givecareful consideration to the Idea of In-stituting a fully funded and legally au-thorized pilot program before we takeoff, since I am certain none of my col-leagues would want to take a ride in anairplane that had not yet been flightCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEtested. If such a program Is Instituted,and if the basic concepts of the FamilyAslstant Act prove workable, then thisproposal can safely be made a permanentreplacement forthepresentwelfaresystem.Iwould liketo add one furtherthought. As yesterday's vote indicated, anumber of my colleagues and I deeplyregret that consideration of this legisla-tion Is limited by a closed rule. Such arule prohibited not only possible amend-ment of the legislation to improve spe-cific sections but also denied us the pos-sibility to propose immediately what Ibelieve to. be a needed pilot program.Mr. TAFT. Mr. Chairman, I want toexpress strong support for H.R. 16311,the Family Assistance Act of 1970. As awelfare board member, as chairman ofthe Hamilton County Council of SocialAgencies, as a State legislator, and asa Member of Congress, I have had per-son\u00e1l contact with the hardships to peo-ple and the problems of society crowdedor aggravated by the deficiencies of ourexisting welfare programs.This measure proposes a broad frontalattack to correct family disruption, dis-incentive to work, inadequate levels, wel-fare-motivated desertion and migration,and a lack of adequate training and daycare facilities. It may develop some prob-lems on Its own. Any comprehensivemeasure of this sort would be almost cer-tain to do so, but it is, at least, a cour-ageous assault on monumental existingdifficulties, and represents an honest at-tempt to adapt our institutions to meetrealistically present-day needs and chal-lenges. The alternative Is to stand by andwatch family relationships deterioratefurther, the relief cycle of generation togeneration to continue, and the burdenon our States, and metropolitan areasmount.Much has been said already about thebill's provisions, I would just like to addemphasis that the .approach of this leg-islation may well have the effect of stem-ming the flow to the cities of those inneed of help and opportunity. It woulddo this by enabling our working and ournonworking poor of the nonurban areasto maintain a minimum standard of liv-ing where they are and thus to encouragethe development of such areas commer-cially and as labor plentiful areas.Mr. FUQUA. Mr. Chairman, the debatehere today has contained much commentthat we are revising our present welfareprogram. Well, there Is no question thatour present welfare program is In needof drastic revision, but this Is not theanswer.What we are actually doing here Is anentirely new concept which will add mil-lions to the welfare rolls at a cost ofbillionsofaddItionaldollars tothe American taxpayer.I believe with many other Membersof the Congress that the priorities of thislegislation are wrong. They are: cashfirst, food second and work or productivelives third. I believe that there shouldbe a reversal of these priorities, thatour thrust should be to help people leadproductive lives and secondly to providefood for the needy, and cash third.Little has been said about the fact thatan estImated 12 millIon persons could beApril 16, 1970added to the welfare rolls and the Fed-eral cost of the program Increased byas much as $5.5 billion.The American people have simply notbeen told the facts about this proposal.We need emphasis on job training sothat those who are able to work can doso and not be relegated to the welfarerolls,A guaranteed annual Income wouldnot serve as an Incentive for an Ameri-can to make a contribution to our society.Many will find that it Is more advan-tageous to sit idly by while they receivea monthly dole from the Federal Treas-ury, making no effort to lead productivelives.This Is more of the something fornothing philosophy. The American peo-ple are going to be shocked when theyunderstand the additional costs whlcithey must pay through their taxes forthis program.Another thing that disturbs me is thatonce we start with this type of program,the only way it will go is for an increasein expenditures. And we are either goingto raise taxes to support such a programor else suffer more deficit spending.We need to Imorove our welfare pro-gram. We need to be concerned aboutthe plight of the blind, the physicallyhandicapped, the helpless child, and allof the other unfortunates of our society.At the same time we have an obliga-tion to make every effort to allow andencourage every citizen who can makea contribution to do so. This program,if adopted, wiliprove to be an expensivemistake and I hope that the Members ofthe Congress will vote against its pas-sage and begin immediately to revise ourpresent welfare laws to eliminate someof the Inequities to truly serve the plightof the needy and those who will have topay the costs of any such program.Mr. MURPHY of New York. Mr. Chair-man, for more than a generation, wel-fare programs throughout the Nationhave grown In size and cost, but accom-plished precious little in reclaiming hu-man resources, providing dignified as-sistance to those genuinely in need, andproviding a ladder out of poverty formillions of Americans. Indeed, these sys-temshavebeencounterproductive\u2014they have served to lock people into pov-erty and despair, rather than lift themout.No single piece of legislation in thepast 25 years has been as critical to theproblem of welfare as the bill we areconsidering today, the Family Assist-ance Act of 1970. I strongly support thisbill, and I extend my congratulationsand compliments to Chairman MILLSand the members of the Committee onWays and Means forbringingthis vitally needed legislation before us.I have long favored a greater Fed-eral assumption of responsibility andparticipation in welfare programs be-cause I believe that the Federal Govern-ment is the only Instrumentality capa-ble of tackling the problem on a nationalbasis. The lesson of a generation is thatno other solution wifi work, because pov-erty knows no regional, sectional, orother jurisdictional boundaries. Itis truly a national problem, requiring anational solution. April 16,1970Overthe years, the large urban areasof America have borne the brunt of thenational problem without having the na-tional resources needed to provide effec-tive and productive welfare assistance.Our cities can no longer be expected toshoulder this burden alone.In my district in New York there iswide-ranging supportforthisbill\u2014 among those who must receive welfare,and among those who do not. All rec-ognize that the existing situation is in-tolerable and should be changed. Theyrecognize that only under the Federalplan will the welfare system fill the needsof those who it is intended to serve, anddistribute the burden evenly through-out the Nation.This legislation establishes a familyassistance plan with Federal eligibilitystandards and benefits for families withchildren, and also provides standardsand minimums for aid to the aged, theblind, and the Inform. National stand-ardization will stop the drift of poorinto the already intolerable ghettos ofthe cities, and give hope to those whosubsist on welfare.It is important to note that this newapproach to welfare contains strong re-quirements for Federal work-registrationand referral-for-employment procedures.The bill authorizes a new work incentiveprogram, and provides for additionalday-care facilities. These important pro-visions will insure that those on welfarewho are capable of working will work.There will be no more opportunity forthose who have used the present systemincorrectly to live on the system withouta genuine effort to find and hold em-ployment.Support for this legislation has comefrom many quarters. The AFL\u2014CIO sup-ports the bill, and notes that it containsimportant labor standard safeguards.The American Labor Alliance, the Na-tional Association of Manufacturers, theNational Association of Senior Citizens,and the Urban Coalition are on recordin support of the national assumption ofthe welfare burden, and of the FamilyAssistance Act of 1970.A major point of controversy in con-sideration of the bill has been the ques-tion of adequacy of income levels au-thorized by the bill. Some have arguedthat the guaranteed minimums are toolow; an equally sincere number of peoplehave argued for lower minimums. It ismy belief -that the levels conta.ined inthis bill are adequate for the initiationof the program. Of course, it is impos-sible to project with 100-percent accur-scy how well these levels will work. How-ever, the Congress is certainly free toadjust these levels as the future war-rants\u2014up or down\u2014and the programshould be permitted to operate for a timeon the levels established by the bill.The family assistance plan is a vitallyneeded first step toward the eliminationof povert.y and despair in America. It willgive new hope to those on welfare\u2014hopefor a brighter future, filled with dignityand promise. It will also herald new hopefor those in our society who support wel-fare, but understandably demand thatthe money and energy spent truly workfor the elimination of poverty. The bur-CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014HOUSEden on these Americans will be eased, andthe future of those on welfare brightened.I strongly support this legislation, andheartily commend it to my colleagues.Mr. DERWINSKI. Mr. Chairman, wehave had thorough debate these past 2days on the merits of this legislation andI believe that the debate was consistentlyobjective.It is obvious that there is legitimatedoubt as to the workability of the pro-gram, as well as legitimate concern- overthe cost and ineffectiveness of existingprograms.I was impressed by the argument thatthe existing welfare programs could and,therefore, were not being effectively ad-ministered and the proposal before uswas at least a practical alternative.After carefully reviewing the figurespresented in the committee report andinterpretation of the figures that manycritics of the bill have produced, I amconvinced that instead of replacing thewelfare program, we are adding a newdimension to the welfare burden. There-fore,I will cast my .vote against themeasure, emphasizing that the questionsraised by many Members have not beeneffectively answered.May I also direct the attention of theMembers to the possibility that the Sen-ate will make drastic revisions of thisplan, adding new costs, and administra-tive complications to it and the Houseconferees will be hard pressed to main-tain the House position against the otherbody in the conference.-I am afraid the bill as drawn will sub-stantially increase the tax burden of theresidents of fllinois and other States,due to the great number of people thatwill be added to the welfare rolls. Inturn, incentives to work will not producethe results needed to remove people fromthe rolls.The bill does -not contaih enough em-phasis on incentives for people to removethemselves from assistance rolls and,therefore, we are not solving the welfareproblem through this measure but un-fortunately compounding it. Therefore,for these and other reasons I will reluc-tant.ly cast my vote against the measure.Mr. HALPERN. Mr. Chairman, thedecade of the 1960's brought many ofour social problems to the forefront, butnone of them have struck our minds andour consciences more forceably thanthose involving our system of public wel-fare. We have become ever more awarethat our present system has not providedthe kind of support and incentives whichpoor families in this country need.It is gratifying, therefore, that posi-tive action toward welfare reform hasbeen initiated by the administration andis being considered by the Congress. I be-lieve that the Family Assistance Act,which we have before us today, will cre-ate a genuinely constructive welfare sys-tem. Its major purpose is to strengthenfamilies, and by so doing -it will strength-en our entire social structure.Our present program of aid to familieswith dependent children, which is thepublic assistance program designed toassist families with children, has a num-ber of basic flaws. First and foremost, itdoes not, in some States, provide even aH 3201a subsistence level of welfare payments.It Is, therefore, creating an ever-growingfuture welfare population through itsfailure to sustain the present one. Se-riously deprived children, as we know, alltoo often grow into deprived adults whocannot hold their own in today's world.Second, although it provides money, itdoes not provide additional kinds of en-couragement and help to families Inneed. It has not helped adults preparefor and nd employment, it has discour-aged them. It has not helped peoplebuild their pwn secure futures, but hasencouraged them to fall back on thesecurity of a welfare payment. It alsohas embodied strong incentives for fam-ily breakup.In short, what should have been aconstructive program, has in fact beendestructive. The many billions of dollarswhich we have invested In welfare havebrought a bitter return.H.R. 16311 represents a turning pointin our efforts. It establishes the goal ofencouraging stable and self-sufficientfamilies, and provides the machinery toachieve this goal.Perhaps the most Important, and cer-tainly the most controversial aspect ofthe proposal is for cash assistance to theworking poor. The family assistance planwould cover some 20 million people, In-stead of the 6.7 million who are nowreceiving AFDC. This is an Impossiblehurdle for some. The very idea of helpingso many millions of Individuals Is abhor-rent to those who believe the only propergoal of a welfare program is to elimi-nate itself.And yet, the President has stated, andas the Committee on Ways and Meanshas agreed, coverage of the working pooris a necessary investment in the future.By helping poor families In which thefather is employed we are not simplyproviding them with needed cash assist-ance for the moment, we are helpingthose families retain their vlbillty, andwe are reducing the Incentive for fathersto leave their families iri order to qualifythem for welfare.We all recognize that one of our majorcauses of poverty and of many of oursocial ills is the broken family. One of.the greatest contributions which we canmake to the public welfare Is to helpfamilies stay together. This bill wouldhelp them. And If the cost is great, Ibelieve it is nonetheless a cost we mustaccept. It is, in any case, a far lowercost to society than the alternative ofallowing the problems of our existingsystem to continue to grow.The proposal also contains incentivesfor all families on welfare to undertakemanpower training and to become em-ployed. Much has been learned from theexperience of the work incentive pro-gram in the last 2 years, and the newmanpower provisions represent an Im-provement over existing law.The bill would require all adults, withcertain specified exceptions, to registerwith the employment service. This pro-cedure would eliminate the current prob-lem of Irregular and uncertain referralsfrom the welfare agencies to the employ-ment service. H 3202The bill would also require the employ-ment service to provide vital services toeach individual who registers. An em-ployability p1an would have to be drawnup for each person, and a whole rangeofrehabilitativeresources wouldbe drawn upon in order to help the welfarerecipient to be trained for and to finda suitable job.Individuals who enter training will re-ceive a training allowance. Perhaps evenmore important, mothers who require daycare services for their children in orderto participate in work or training will beprovided them. The bill makes possible amajor expansion of day care resourcesby authorizing the Secretary of Health,Education, and Welfare to pay for up to100 percent of the cost of necessary daycare projects.Studies of the present work incentiveprogram have shown that one of the ma-jor impediments of welfare reciolents toentering or retaining employment is thelack of adequate child care facilities. Thisbill would work toward eliminating thisimpediment, and at the same time pro-vide the kind of quality child care serv-ices which many disadvantaged childrenneed. The bill envisages preschool childcare programs which will include educa-tional, medical, nutritional, and socialservices. In this way, too, it will reducethe likelihood of rearing a new genera-tion of welfare recipients.The bill moves toward a greater fed-eralization of welfare, and I believe thatwelfare recipients throughout the UnitedStates will benefit from this. A new Fed-eral payment floor Is established, andwelfare recipients who live In the Stateswhich now pay amounts below that floorwill benefit very obviously by being elig-ible for a higher cash payment. But needyfamilies everywhere willbenefit fromFederal administration of family assist-ance payments and from the new Federalstandards for eligibility. The family as-sistanceolanwillintroducegreater equity, uniformity, and dignity Into thetreatment of welfa'i'e recipients.The States will benefit, also. They can,if they choose, elect to have the FederalGovernment administer the entire wel-fare program for them, retaining Qnlythe obligation of providing sunportiveservices to welfare recipients who are intraining, and of contributing their shareof the cash assistance payments.Hopefully, then the proposal will helpto equalize the current welfare burdenamong the States, at the same time thatit contributes toward greater equity for'welfare receioients.Although I have concentrated my re-marks on the provisions of the bill whichrelate to families, because as we all rec-ognize that it Is the heart of the welfareproblem, I am also In strong support ofthe provisions which relate to the old,the blind, and the disabled. The newFederal minimum standard of need willbe of very great assistance to' this groupof needy individuals. A payment of $220for a couple, which is provided by thebill, will enable many to move out of pov-erty. This is surely the least which wecan do for them. The new liberalized pro-visions relating to earnings exemptionswill be of great help to those who are InCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEa position to undertake employment, andwill also encourage them to do so.By combining the three existirg adult,programs into one single program and'providing for Federal eligibility require-ments, we willbe promoting greaterequity and uniformity for this group,just as we will be for recipients of familyas&stance.Mr. Chairman, thisbill has strongmerits. Probably every Member of theHouse has some point, major or minor,with which he disagrees and would liketo change. But the administration hasworked long and hard over the bill. TheCommittee on Ways and Means hasspent months in public hearings and inexecutive session refining the proposal.And we have now a well thought-outpackage of 'true welifare reform.There will, in the future, be Improve-ments which we will want to make. ButI am satisfied that the bill moves in theproper direction. Levels of assistance willcertainly have to be reconsidered in thefuture, as the administration has testi-fied will be necessary. But the family as-sistance plan can stand now as a solidsocial program which will benefit boththe needy and the general public. I urgemy colleagues to join with me in Act of 1970.The President has urged the passageof this bill as a means of reducing wel-fare loads and his request and assuranceare entitled to great consideration'.Although there are many debatablepoints about this legislation, there aretwo principal considerations which Im-pel me to support it. One is the fact thatthe proposed method of providing forpoor families may bring about the elimi-nation of the scandalous defects in theaid to the dependent children program.Certainly the present system has provedto be a disaster and I agree that we mustembrace any reasonable alternative.The serious shortcomings of the wel-fare system In its present form are obvi-ous. In operation the system fosters fam-ily breakups, it encourages benefit re-qipients to stay on welfare by failing tohave workable incentives and provisionsfor becoming employed, and it has failedto slow the steady movement of needyfamilies from State to State in search ofhigher welfare payments. In short, thepresent welfare system is unworkable; Itdefinitely must be changed in the direc-tionof encouraging employment andfamily stability. No one can guarantee,of course, that this will work but I amconvinced that we must try this method.It is significant, I think, that no one hasoffered any alternative.The second important point is the pro-vision in this bill for a reduction of varia-tions in payment levels among the Statesthrough the introduction of a Federalfloor for family assistance payments.This provision should help to eliminatethe flow of people to the most generousStates, such as Connecticut, where pay-ment levels have been markedly higher.This Is an objective which I have advo-cated for a long period of time and itwould have a marked effect upon theApril 16,1970increasing welfare rolls In the State ofConecticut.In the first session of the 91st CongressI introduced legislation to require theestablishmentofnationallyuniform minimum standards and eligibility re-quirements for public assistance, and Iam gratified to see that my proposal Isincluded in the provisions of this bill.The uniform eligibility requirements cou-pled with standardized welfare paymentswill help correct inequities In the presentsystem which have resulted in my ownState of Connecticut spending a stagger-ing 30 percent of the State's gross gen-eral fund expenditures for gross welfareexpenditures in 1968\u201469.One of the most significant innova-tions of this proposal is to require thatas a prerequisite to receipt of benefitsevery adult in assisted families registerat an employment office for work ortraining or sign up for vocational reh-bilitation. Although work Incentives wereput into Federal public asistance pro-grams by major legislation in 1962 andagain in 1967, the incentives have notbeen effective and there is a continuingneed to tighten provisions tying the re-ceipt of benefits to a firm commitment towork.It is the children, our future citizens,who are my concern. In them lies thehope of tomorow. If we can contributeto greater stability in the family and eli-minate the financial encouragement forfatherless families, I believe that we aretaking a major step in the right direc-tion, and I am convinced that this planshould have an opportunity to be tested.Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, that eve-ning last August when President Nixonannounced his proposed welfare reformplan, a national radio network asked meto perform one of those \"Instant analy-ses\" which later became so unpopularwith the administration. My very firstcomment on the President's suggestionswas that parts of the proposal shouldbe recognized as meaningful and pro-gressive, while others should be exposedas mere continuations of the atavisticmentality which created the current wel-fare problems In the first place. Eightmonths and Innumerable contentionslater, I find that my view has changedvery little.There is no question that the Presi-dent deserves credit for opening up theissue of welfare reform and for a num-ber of the specific recommendations Inhis bill. The minimum Federal paymentguarantee, the Inclusion of the workIrgpoor in, the programs, and the nation-alization of eligibility standards are alldesperately needed changes in the pres-ent AFDC system.The House Ways and Means Commit-tee should likewise be complimented forseveral improvements they fashioned inthe original proposal. I was especiallypleased that the base' payment for aidto the aged, blind, and disabled was In-creased by over 20 percent. The added in-centives which should result In Federaladministration of the entire family as-sistance program was also a very neces-sary betterment, as was the eliminationof 10 percent local matcilng require-ments for day care centers. April 16,1970Collectively,these suggestions mark asignificant forward thrust in the Fed-eral Government's attitude concerningits responsibilities to the poor of thisNation, and for that reason I shall votefor H.R. 16311. Nevertheless; my col-leagues should thoroughly understandthat this bill falls far short of reachingwhat those responsibilities ought to be,and that all of us in this chamber whohave worked so long for an adequate wel-fare system will not be satisfied until theyare.My primary objection tO H.R. 16311concerns the payment provisions, whichare inferior even to those in the Presi-dent's originaj bill. It is disgraceful, forinstance, that the eight Southern Statesthat have done the very worst job of pro-viding for their needy citizens are re-warded in this legislation by allowingthem to terminate all State payments.Mr. Chairman, we have all been pre-sentedwithdocumented'-. proofthat Americans are starving to death in theseStates\u2014that children are of ten forced toeat clay to quiet their empty stomachs.How then can we justifiably turn aroundand tell those very State governmentsprimarily responsible for creating theseIntolerable conditions that they need nolongercontributeanythingtotheir eradication? Surely no one rationallybelieves that a welfare mother in At-lanta, Birmingham, New Orleans. or St.Louis can raise her child on the 82 centsa day from the Federal minimum. Atleast the President's bill required theseStates to continue 50 percent of theirformer paltry share. I thought that pro- vision was inadequate\u2014the current one is unconscionable.Of course, meager though it is, at leastAFDC recipients in those eight South-ern and border States will receive someincrease in their monthly checks\u2014whichis more than can be said for recipientsin Ohio or any of the other 41 States. Ifboth Houses of Congress would pass HR.16311 and the President sign it today,these people would get the same unac-ceptable pittance tomorrow that they re-ceived yesterday. A rather unbelievableresult from a bill heralded as a great hu-manitarian measure.Moreover, the problems with the billonly begin with the amounts. The work-ing requirements, while somewhat clekrerafter the committee's action, are stillan administrative nightmare. The $30per month allowable Income is barelyenough to cover the cost of going to andfrom the job. The welfare mother withschool-aged children Is deprived of rais-ing them\u2014the most blatant form of dis-crimination against the poor. There isno provision for cost-of-living increases.And perhaps most pernicious of all, thewhole scheme seems to still be premisedon the attitude that the recipient is basic-allya lazy,booze-guzzling ne'er-do-well\u2014an attitude proved totally falla-cious long ago to all who cared to listen.So, Mr. Chairman, I shall vote for thebill. However, neither I nora number ofmy colleagues who believe that povertyshould not exist In the richest country inthe history of this planet will walk fromthe floor in any state of euphoria. But we promise you that we will be back.Mrs. SULLIVAN. Mr. Chairman, ap-parently a lot of votes are going to becast for or against this very controversialpiece of legislation, the so-called familyassistance plan, or FAP, on the basis ofhunch, or hope, or of sympathy for thepoor or prejudice against the poor, orbecause of confidence in the judgmentand wisdom of the President and Mr.Moynthan, or because of lack of suchconfidence. Any of these motivations mayperhaps be defensible ones for casting a vote for or against this bill but they arenot nearly as good reasons as listeningto the full debate and trying to make anindependent judgment. And, unfortu-nately, many of the deeply thought-outand well-reasoned arguments on this billover the last 2 days have been made toa nearly empty House.NEW DIRECTIONORDISASTROUS MISTAKE?This is tragic. There is very little otherlegislation we will consider in this Con-gress of potentially more far-reachingsignificance. This bill challenges us todecide if we are on the threshold of abrilliant new direction in solving someof our most serious social problems, or onthe verge of an economically and so-cially disastrous mistake of incalculableconsequence.I have been in attendance throughoutthe entire debate on this bill, hoping tofind solid evidence that a far-reachingbill so strongly urged upon us by thePresident and so strongly supported bythe Committee on Ways and Means,which includes Members who enjoy thehighest degree of respect and esteemamong all Members of the House, is onewhich I could support. I have found nosuch evidence.I know from long exposure to the bitterproblems in a major city that our welfareprogram, initiated in the early days ofthe New Deal to meet what were thenwell-understoodfamilycrisissitua- tions\u2014a program little changed sincethen except in details\u2014is completely outof date In terms of today's problems. Ifthis family assistance plan had been a part of the original Social Security Actof 1935, it would have made a great dealof sense. In those days, the concept ofpublic asistance was new and people whoneeded welfare assistance could not waitto find the Jobs which would get them offwelfare. Most of them would have leapedenthusiastically to take advantage of theopportunity to learn new skills, andwould have welcomed supplemental ben-efits while in job training and then whenstarting to work, benefits which wouldhave speeded the economic rehabilitationof most of the families then eligible forthe kind of help now called for in thisbill.WORKINCENTIVE PROGRAMS ALREADY ENACTEDWe made repeated attempts during theKennedy and Johnson administrationsto establish programs to achieve whatthis bill is now intended by its sponsorsto do\u2014that Is, to encourage people on public assistance to take training andgradually become self-supporting. Thechairman of the Committee on Ways andMeans (Mr. MILLS), who played an enor-mouse role in the passage of those pro-grams, referred to them yesterday. TheStates, he said, have not accepted theirH 3203resporjsjbjflties to make those programswork as intended, and so the results havebeen dirappointjng.Therefore, this bill would place almostthe entire burden of responsibility\u2014ad-ministrative and financial\u2014on the Fed-eral Government, getting rid of the case- by-case investigation of eligibility andletting people just file a form sayingthey are eligible and immediately re- ceiving checks from the Government tobring their income up to specified levels.In view of the degree of welfare cheat-ing which is already regarded by thepublic as being so widespread as to beabsolutely shameful and indefensible, Iwonder what public reaction would beto a plan of this nature\u2014where yOu couldjust rate yourself as eligible, whether you are or not, and hope the computer willnever catch. up with you. Catching thecheats is not insurmountable if you have enough computers and enough peopleto check the computers, but in a de- mocracy even the best-intentioned lawcannot survive if there is public convic-tion that it is being widely abused bychiselers at the expense of the moderate-income taxpayer who has just notedonce again this week, with shock anddismay, how high a percentage of his pay is going to Uncle Sam.PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING AND ACCEPTANCE AREESSENTIALThis is one of the reasons I am so much against turning the food stampprogram into a free handout, giving thestamps to people to buy enough food toeat well without having to pay anythingfor them. It is not the cost of the stampswhich disurbs me: We can afford, out ofour tremendous abundance of food inthis country to help every American toeat a proper, nutritious diet. What wor- ries me about giving the stamps out freeis the implication that the Governmenthas the obligation to give every poor family all the food it needs without any cost to it whatsoever, so that the moneythat family would normally spend forfood could be spent for other things.Once that principle were established,the moderate incomefamily,which struggles to pay its bills and struggles toafford a decent diet, would so resent theidea of other families receiving absolutelyfree more food than the self-supportingfamily can afford to buy that such resent-ment would destroy the basis of publicsupport for any kind of food stampprogram.I feel that this so-called family as-sistance plan invites a similar reaction\u2014not envy for someone who is needy get-ting a little help or even a lot of help;rather it is the likelihood of indignationby the taxpaying family that its taxesare being used to subsidize someone whoabuses the program.Most people will gladly pay taxes atpersonal sacrifice to help. children breakthe welfare cycle. But they insist thatany such progTam be tightly adminis-tered to weed out adult chiselers who usethe welfare payments for their own In-dulgence rather than for the childrenfor whom the money is intended. Andthis is why the aid to dependent childrenprogram is in such bad public repute. IfI thought this bill would solve the prob-CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014HOUSE H 3204lems, I would not hesitate for a secondto endorse it wholeheartedlY.MAIN NEED IS FOR ADEQUATE DAY CARE CENTERSBut throughout the long hours of de-bate on this bill, I have not been ableto see or learn how this bill would solveour real welfare problems. All It woulddo, it seems to me, would be to give theimpression the problems were in someway being solved, as if an income of $31a week\u2014which is what this bill wouldassure a family of four, including theirownearnings\u2014wouldunifybrokenhomes, prevent deserting, encourage jobtrainiiig, and so on.I do not know what the figure wouldhave to be to serve as incentive enoughto accomplish those objectives; no onein the debate has ventured to give sucha figure. We all know that If the figurewere set high enough to really achieve these goals, the sums needed to carryout the program could never be appro-priated.Probably the main key to getting morewelfare mothers motivated Into takingjob training and getting off welfare Isto provide adequate\u2014and I mean ad-equate\u2014daycare centers for their chil-dren. This bill does not do that. It nib-bles at the problem. I would gladly voteto spend all the money the bill authorizesto be spent for the supplementary bene-fits if it were used instead to build andoperate the kind of day care center onecan find, for instance, in the center ofdowntown Singapore, but hardly any-where in the United States. We had suchcenters during World War II, and moth-ers gratefully left their young childrenthere each day to take jobs where theirskIlls and hands were needed. If we cando It in a war, we can certainly do It inthe achievement of the social objectivesof this bill\u2014knowing that we would becutting right to the heart of this wholeissue.I have never pretended, even to myself,that everyone else is wrong and I aloneam right because I know that could nothappen in the Congress or anywhere else.But I have deep reservations about thisbill after hearing the entire debate\u2014reservations so deeP about the eventualdirection or cost of this program, com-pared to its anticipated results, that Ihave reluctantly decided I must voteagainst It.The fact that it would cost so muchto do so little, and the fact that the costof doing what would have to be done Ifthe concept of the bill were really tosolve anything would be so prohibitive,fortify my conclusion.DEFEAT OF BILL COULD RESULT IN BE'ITERPROGRAMMy whole record In the Congress hasbeen directed toward helping all of ourpeople, and particularly our very low in-come people, to enjoy a better standardof living. I have often been criticizedand even attacked for my efforts In be-half of social welfare legislation, and Ihave been willing tO stand on my recordbecause I think we all prosper In thiscountry only as every American has adecent opportunity to advance himselfeconomically. If I thought this bill wouldsolve any of our serious welfare prob-lems, I would be delighted to vote for It.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEPerhaps other Members have morewisdom, more knowledge of this issue,more confidence in the draftsmanshipof this program, and do not suffer thesame doubts I feel so strongly. I recallthat a lot of Members Of Congress couldnot see the good In the social security billin 1935, and made a partisan issue of it,and voted against It, and of course werewrong. On a measure like this bill, onecan imagine that a \"no\" vote, for what-ever reason, might stand forever as amonument to one's lack of foresight.Thus, with so many Members ready toaccept this bill, I feel somewhat lonelyin taking a negative position, but I thinkthe Members here know that I do notcast my vote lightly on any issue or with-out feeling in my heart that my vote isthe right one. On that prayerful basis,I will vote \"nay.\"On the unlikely possibility that Itmight be defeated here, or is recommit-ted. I am sure the Committee on Waysand Means could give us a bill its mem-bers were convinced could do what theyknow this bill can never accomplish inachieving a real, thorough, reform of ourwhole welfare program.Mr. DONOHUE. Mr. Chairman, as weapproach a determination on the meas-ure before us, H.R. 16311, I think weshould be mindful of two basic facts.First, experts of all political persua-sions agree that the present welfare sys-tem is a tragic failure.Second,itisthe Federal Govern-ment's responsibility to try to establisha workable system; one that will restorehuman dignity to those caught in thewelfare trap; one that eases the plightof the taxpayer by moving persons, bywork incentives and requirements, fromwelfare rolls to payrolls; one that pre-serves, rather than attacks, the basicfamily structure.The present program of aid to fam-ilies with dependent children\u2014AFDC\u2014actually discourages recipients from ac-cepting jobs. In almost all States, allot-ments are reduced customarily by theamount of family earnings, so that theeffect is to put a 100-percent tax on earn-ings. Even more disturbing, a familywith the father employed full time is in-eligible for benefits, no matter how smallhis income or how large his family. Thissituationinevitablyencouragesthe worker to quit his job to increase hisfamily's income.Under the measure before us a family'spayment will be reduced by only half oftotal earnings. The principle will befirmly established that a family withearned income from a job will be betteroff as a result of that job.As you know, Mr. Chairman,an experi-ment conducted in New Jersey over thelast 3 years confirms the tendency ofincentives to encourage people to workthemselves out of poverty. An early re-port on the experiment concluded that\u2014The work effort of participants receivingpayments increased relative to the work ef-fort of those not receiving payments.Let us realize further that in mostStates the present AFDC program cre-ates a financial Incentive for the breakupof family units. Since families with amale head of household are cut off fromApril 16,1970any AFDC benefits, a father, by desertinghis wife and children, can entitle them topublic assistance. How can we hope tosurvive as an individual nation, Mr.Chairman, and as the leader of the civi-lized world, if we encourage by Govern-ment policy the disintegration of thebasic unit of society, the family?The bill before us would eliminate thisfamily instability incentive, and encour-age the father to stay and seek employ-ment.Also, Mr. Chairman, the wide variationin State levels of public assistance per-mitted under the present welfare systemhas pla\u00f4ed an unfair burden on thoseStates attempting to shoulder the re-sponsibility for their needy and deprived.With the family assistance programproviding a nationwide set of benefitsand eligibility standards, these inequitieswill be eased, and every State system willbe relieved to some extent, with an over-all reduction of almost $600 million.There are many other features of thisbill, of course, designed to insure that itaccomplishes Its goal of moving personsfrom welfare rollstopayrolls. Able-bodied adults will be required to regis-ter for work or work training, unless car-ing for preschool children or sick adults.Day-care facilities will be expanded, tomake it possible for welfare mothers towork while their children get adequatesupervision. A nationwide, computerizedjob bank is to be set up, and manpowerprograms will be bolstered.Mr. Chairman, this is in no sense apartisan matter. President Nixon's basicproposals are contained In H.R. 16311,along with significant revisions voted bythe distinguished House Ways and MeansCommittee. The billissupported bygroups as diverse as the AFL-CIO andthe National Association of Manufactur-ers. The family assistance plan is de-signed and intended to offer to the poornot a handout, but rather a hand-up.Let us extend that encouraging handIn conscientious effort to project whole-some, farsighted reform into an ad-mittedly antiquated welfare system whilewe remain ever watchful and ready topromptly repair any unexpected weak-nesses or even Initiate repeal review ofthe whole program if administration andcongressionalanticipationsarenotquickly fulfilled.Mr. COHELAN. Mr. Chairman, I risein support of H.R. 16311. I do so, how-ever, with mixed emotions.This bill provides for a Federal assist-ance payment of $1,600 for a family offour with no other income. This basicbenefit is increased by the exclusion ofthe value of food stamps from the defini-tion of earned income so that It is pos-sible tO have Federal assistance for afamily of four at the level of $2,464.In addition to this Federal assistancethere are provisions for a State supple-mental assistance, of which the FederalGovernment could pay up to 30 percent.These supplemental payments are to bemaintained payments at January 1970AFDC levels or up to the poverty level,which ever is lower. Under the provisionsof the bill the Secretary of Health, Edu-cation, and Welfare would be requiredto annually update the property levels toreect the increased cost of 1Ivin. This April 16, 1970bill alsoconsolidates the assistance forthe blind, disabled, and aged.The coverage under this bifi will In-crease those assisted from 7 mIllion to20 mfflion under family assistance plan\u2014FAP\u2014and from 3 to 4 million under theblind, disabled, and aged. The total Fed-eral-State cost is estimated to be in-creased by an additional $4.4 billion forFAP including $500 million for blind,disabled and aged and $600 million forjobtrainingfeaturesandday-care centers.In analyzing this bill, I share the con-cern of a number of my colleagues thatthe $1,600 Federal minimum is inade-quate to cover even the barest necessitiesof food, clothing, and shelter for our less-fortunate citizens. Although this will beincreased by the State supplement, Iwould like to see a cost-of-living featurein the direct Federal contribution. Sincethis bill comes to the floor under a closedrule, we cannot amend the bill, but Ithink that the final version should in-clude a higher Federal base and the cost-of-living feature in the Federal contribu-tion so that our poorer citizens are notleft out in the cold by fluctuations in oureconomy.The coverage of this bill is commend-able but in some areas falls short. Thebill quite correctly extends coverage tothe poverty-level families headed by full-time employed males\u2014working poor\u2014and families where the father is unem-ployed and at home. This hopefully willcurb the trend in the dissolution of thefamily structure of the poor.This bill also requires FAP benefici-aries to register for work training andemployment, Those specifically exemptare: the aged, disabled, and ill; motherscaring for children under 6 years of age;mothers in cases where father register;citizens caring for ill members of thehousehold; or citizens under 16 or under21 and in school. All others are requiredto register. Under the bill, the Secretaryof Health, Education, and Welfare is re-quired to provide for child-care centersfor working mothers and those in jobtraining. These centers can be funded100 percent by the Federal Government.The House Ways and Means Commit-tee has to be congratulated because ofits improvements over the administra-tion's work-requirement proposals, butI still have serious reservations about therequired registration of mothers for jobtraining and job referrals. In addition,I am concerned that there will not beenough high quality day-care centers orJob training programs even though theyare carefully delineated in the bill. Also,I am not convinced that the food stampprogram feature of the family assistanceplan should not be replaced by a cashequivalent.Yet, the bill represents a step ahead ofthe crumbling AFDC structure it replaces.The AFDC has, as some Members pointout, institutionalized poverty. The pro-jected cost of AFDC this year is $4.3 bil-lion, and HEW projects the cost to ex-ceed $12 billion by 1975. This new familyassistance program attempts to redresssome glaring weaknesses of the presentstructure:It establishes Federal standards toeliminate inequitable treatment but theCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014HOUSE$1,600 Federal minimum seems painfullyinadequate;It extends coverage to families headedby an unemployed father and extendscoverage to the working poor;It will reduce State and regional dif-ferences although some States will stillhave reductions;It establishes Federal standards andminimums for the Nation's aged, blind,and disabled; andIt attempts through stronger Federalparticipation to extend job training andjob placement.All of these new directions should besubject to the most rigorous testing andanalyses to correct dIculties that arise.This new family assistance plan is nota panacea for ending poverty but I dofeel that it offers an increased oppor-tunity for many of our less-fortunate cit-izens to break out of the poverty cycle.The existing welfare structure has notbeen effective, I think the family assist-ance plan represents a prudent first stepin correcting some of its deficiencies.Mr. RANDALL. Mr. Chairman, I amagainst the passage of H.R. 16311, labeled\"the Family Assistance Act of 1970.\"There are so many good and valid rea-sons to oppose the passage of this billthat it becomes a problem to enumeratesuch reasons in their relative importanceor to decide which deserves the greateremphasis. It will take too much time toprovide detailed statistics to prove thedanger of this bill. But all of these back-up figures can be fully documented andsubstantiated.This welfare package is a 100-pagebill with an accompanying report of 85pages. It will entail a first annual Fed-eral cost of $4.4 billion in three cate-gories. By 1975, it Is estimated the annualcost will have increased to $7.3 billion.Under the provisions of this bill afamily which consists of the parents andtwo children will be assigned a familybenefit level of $1,600 per year. If theirincome falls below this amount, supple-ments will be paid to elevate their incometo the $1,600 level. So far as I have beenable to find out, this is the first time inthe history of our country the FederalGovernment has agreed by law to providea guaranteed annual income to its citi.zens.In my opinion, this is a wrong turn forour country to take at this time. Re-gardless of the magnitude of the figuresthat are involved, under the provisions ofthis bill, there is a philosophy which isclosely akin to a pure socialistic philos-ophy.In the present law administered bythe States it is true there is aid or wel-fare for the aged, the badly disabled andthe blind. ThIs is true welfare. On theother hand, to pay able-bodied peopleto do nothing is a shame. Such peoplewho can sit at home and be guaranteeda fixed amount of income may very wellsoon lose their own self-respect. As muchas I deplore the deuression conditionswhich necessitated WPA at least thiswas a true work program for the able-bodied. With all of the jobs that go beg-ging in our country today, people oughtto work and should not be encouragedto stay home in idleness.Of course we are all mindful of theH 3205words that have been used to make thisact saleable. It is argued that \"workf are\"should replace the word \"welfare.\" Yet,careful study of those portions of thebill which require each member of thefamily to register for employment ortraining, will reveal there is a long listof exceptions, exclusions as well as along list of exemptions. One membersuggested that the bill took at least threepages of print to provide all the loop-holes for those who want to receive wel-fare but do no work.One of the worst things about thisentire welfare package is that the guar-anteed annual income amounts to a kindof foot in the door that could very wellbe open ended. True, we have establisheda definite figure for this current yearbut I have reason to believe that thosewho vote for this measure today will haveopponents campaigning against themwho will be promising an increase inguaranteed annual income if they areelected. Each of those who support thisbill today should pause long enough toask themselves the question, Will theybe for larger payments next year? Andthe next year? And the following year?If we pass this bill today we; in effect,establish a policy that the Federal Gov-ernment will reward those who willchoose to take advantage of every exclu-sion, exception, and exemption under thebeautiful description of workfare. Thisbeginning of a national guaranteed in-come, instead of proving any kind of anincentive, could well be described as adisincentive to improve earnings or oc-cupational capacities, and a disincentivefor recipients to improve their lot in life.Today, we hear so much about revenuesharing with the States and the desir-ability of decentralization toward greaterState responsibility. Has anyone takenthe time to consider what this bill willdo to such concepts? It should be re-called that benefits payable under titleII of this measure spells out that theremust be a State supplement in order toreceive Federal funds. The very naturalquestion to follow Is how well can thealreadyimproverishedStatesafford these additional demands on their treas-uries for welfare funds?In passing, it should be noted that ifthe present program is repealed a newFederal program Is substituted underwhich the States are forbidden to Im-pose restrictions such as duration ofresidence requirements and the prohibi-tion of payments to aliens. Then thismeans that the recipients in low-benefitStates will flock to States where higherbenefits are paid with theresult offurther overcrowding ofthealready teeming citiesin those States wherehigher paying State programs are ineffect.I hope I am making it clear that I amnot opposed to all of the provisions ofthis bill. I am unalterably opposed tothat part which commences or beginsfor the first time a revolutionary guaran-teed Income plan. Because of the gagrule under which all the Members of thisHouse are muted, muzzled, and have hadtheir voices stilled to offer any amend-ments, there is no way to eliminate thismost objectionable provision, unless theminority is fair enough to offer a motion H 3206to recommit or else hope for the defeat ofthe bill or final passage.Nearly allof the Members of theHouse are for welfare reform, but mostof us are also against welfare expan-sion. If the figures which have beenmade available to me are correct, thisbill will provide for tripling the numberof persons on welfare. It would add about3 million more families, or 15 millionmore persons. These figures have beenrather carefully concealed in most ofthe discussions. It is little wonder thatthey have, because therein ites the entrywedge for the guaranteed annual income.The present measure extends the guar-antee to families with fully employedfathers. I recognize that the proponentswill counter such a statement by sayingthat if the head of a family refuses towork or take a better-paying job he willlose his welfare. That is true. But whatreally happens is that his share\u2014$300per year\u2014will be deducted from the fam-ily welfare allotment and the rest ofthe family allotment will continue to beguaranteed with nothing required andno questions asked about the expendi-ture of the remainder of the money.One of the best criteria of the weak-ness of the so-called workfare sectionof the bill is that it is the subject ofcriticism by conservatives because theybelieve there are too many loopholes andat the same time is the target of criti-cism by the liberals because there arenot enough loopholes. Both groups thusseem to admit that it will take a costly,cumbersome bureaucracy whichwill grow to supervise the assignment of jobopportunities and the training of mil-lions of people if such provisions are tobe really and truly enforced. The billdeserves a lot more consideration by theCommittee on Ways and Means andshould be restudied in detail if we expectto reform our welfare programs ratherthan the vast expansion of these pro-grams.Search as carefully and as frequentlyas you choose and you will find nowherein this bill any provisions to finance it.Even if all the surplus anticipated by thepresent administration in this currentyear's budget materializes, there wouldnot be enough money to pay for thebenefits of HR. 16311. No matter howhatd an effort is made to conceal thefact,ifthis billis passed, this sameCommittee on Ways and Means will haveto propose a tax increase to pay for thishandout. Does this Committee on Waysand Means expect to extend the surtax,with increased rates back to 10 percentin order to finance what has been socleverly called the Family AssistanceAct?Does the Committee on Ways andMeans intend to raise the payroll taxprovisions? Do they propose a socialsecurity payroll tax increase, doubledin order to provide family assistancebenefits? These are questions which noone has answered during this debate andso far as I know, no one has made anattempt to answer.I had hoped I could be granted a fewminutes out of the 6 hours of debate topropound some questions to those threemembers on the Committee on Ways andCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSEMeans who were opposed to this bill.Even with 6 hours, like any other Mem-bers, I was denied by the floor managersof this bill even a few minutes to inter-rogate some of the members of the com-mittee. The questions I would have askedwould have been to explain how the dis-tinguished members of this most distin-guished committee proposed to financethe cost of H.R. 16311. I would have alsoasked the proponent members of thecommittee who wrote this measure, to tryto explain that if the present program isa failure how do they expect to resusci-tate It by spending 4 bIllion more moneyon a program that is quite similar, butdiffering only in the machinery for pay-ing out money for nonproductiveness andadding about 15 million people to thewelfare rolls as HR. 16311 will do?To recapitulate, our principal objec-tion is directed to that part of the billwhich llegins guaranteeing incomes tofamilies with employed fathers. Once westart this It could well be that it willnot be too long before one-third or moreof our national population will be re-ceiving income supplements at a cost of$20 billion more annually. The bill offersno improvement in the present adminis-trative tangle that causes the presentwelfare program to be so ineffective. Asthose three members of the committeewho joined in dissenting views put It\"for all the rhetoric about work incen-tives the bill merely puts cash paymentsfirst.\"We commenced consideration of thisbill on April 15 which is the day onwhich everyone in America must filetheir income tax returns for 1969. It issignificant that we conclude debate 1 daylater giving all of our taxpayers an ad-ditional day to think of the potential im-pact that this legislation will have uponthem In future years.The truth is that the provisions ofH.R. 16311 providing for a guaranteedincome is a dangerous snowball thatcan grow and grow to where it can sad-dle future generations of taxpayers withan unbearable burden.Mr. RARICK. Mr. Chairman, our fore-fathers who carved this civilization out ofa wilderness did so without any expecta-tion of a guaranteed Income or livelihood.As free men they sought Individual lib-erty under Ood.Immigrants from foreign lands whohave come to our country to becomeAmericans were not induced by thepromise of a guaranteed dole\u2014mostsought escape from tyranny, and achance for a better life through freedom.I care not what name it bears, anymeasure of law which would take fromthe worker and give to the nonpro-ducer\u2014who is not ill or handicapped\u2014Isrecognized by the people as a guaranteedincome plan\u2014legalized theft. It is an as-cursed philosophy which will demoralizeevery worker.Have we not t\u00f3rmented and politicallyexploited the poor long enough? Mustthey be blamed further? For, ironically,the motivating force behind this sinis-terplanflowsstrongerfromthe wealthy\u2014the successful and upper-in-come groups of our society\u2014than poor who under-April 16,1970stand gains from distribution-of-the-wealth programs? In four generations ofrehabilitative welfare, many of the samefamilies remain on welfare while therich, the manipulators of the program,have become richer.Few among us would have ever fearedthat a controlled Socialist plan such asguaranteed income would be the an-nounced goal and program of a Republi-can President. Had this proposal arisenunderaDemocraticPresident,one doubts it could have received such a bi-partisan support?The positive thinkers urge us to lookat the good side of the plan\u2014to ignorethe evil\u2014while the progressives say givethe plan a chance to see what will hap-pen.I say neither time or experience Isneeded to know a scheme born of upsidedown fantasy. Socialism but begets so-cialism.In our lifetime we have seen empirebuilding by a central government underboth national parties exert more andmore power and control over our livesand institutions, and, as always, throughthe inducement of our moneys.Federal funds are but followed withFederal control. Witness the downfall ofState authority, local government, in-dustries, public schools, labor unions, andnow this latest attack on the basic unitof our society\u2014our families.This bill is a menace to the family\u2014with its expected guidelines and the ever-present threat of a removal of funds fornoncompliance with some bureaucrat'sideological dictates.Today's bill p'aces a ceiling of $1,600a year for coverage. Who will guaranteethat next year the ante will not be $10,000or $20,000?We have all wItnessed socialism withits foot-in-the-dogr advance. It survivesonly on growth and requires expansionto bring more and more people under itsnefarious umbrella.If H.R. 16311 passes this body and be-comes law, we are participating in thecreation of a new feudal system In theUnited States, in which case we are at-tending the funeral of the American tra-ditions of our fathers\u2014work, pride, thriftand individuality.The class war will then have officiallybeen instituted.I would never cast my people's onevote for such an un-American measure.Mr. BYRNESofWisconsin.Mr. Chairman, we have no further requestsfor time.Mr. MILLS.

Mills, (Democrat, Arkansas) Chairman,Committee on Ways and Means, U.S. House of Representatives,today announced the decisions made by the Committee on Ways and Means on the subject of Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid for drafting purposes. The staffs have been instructed to prepare a draft embodying these decisions and bring it back to the Committee.The decisions are as follows:I. AMENDMENTS RELATED TO THE SOCIAL SECURITYCASH PROGRAM1. CASH BENEFIT INCREASESocial security payments to the 26.2 million beneficiaries on the rolls would be increased by 5 percent beginning with payments for the month of January 1971 (payable On February 3,1971). This benefit increase will mean additional payments of $1.7 billion in the first 12 months.2. RETIREMENT TESTThe retirement test, which provides for reducing benefits of socialsecurity beneficiaries who have earnings, would be amended by in-Creasing the annual exempt amount from the present level of $1,680 to $2,000. For each $ of earnings up to $3,200, a recipient's benefit would be reduced by $1. For each $1 of earnings over $3,200 per year, a beneficiary would lose $1 in benefit payments. An additional $475million would be paid out for months in 1971 under this provision.3. 100 PERCENT WIDOW'S AND WIDOWER'S BENEFIT AT AGE 65 AND REDUCED BENEFITS FOR WIDOWERS AT AGE 60Under present law a full widow's (or dependent widower's) benefitapplied for at age 62 or later is equal to 82 percent of the primary insurance amount of the wage earner. An actuarially reduced benefitmay be received by a widow at age 60. Under the bill a widow orwidower would be entitled to a benefit equal to 100 percent of the(1) 2primary insurance amount if first applied for at age 65 or later. Benefitsapplied for between age 62 and 65 would be proportionately increasedover the present 82 percent rate according to the age of the applicantat the time of application. In addition, widowers under age 62 wouldbe granted the same privilege of applying for benefits on an actuariallyreduced basis as now applies to widows. There are 3.3 million widowsand widowers on the rolls who will receive additional benefits. $700million in additional benefit payments will be made in the first 12months.4. AGE 62\u2014COMPUTATION POINT FOR MENUnder present law, the method of computing benefits for men andwomen differs in that all years of earnings up to age 65 must be takeninto account in determining average wages for men, while for women,only years up to age 62 must be included. This discrepancy, whichpresently favors women over men, would be eliminated by applyingthe same rules to men as now apply to women. In the first 12 months,an additional $925 million would be paid out. An estimated 10 millionon the rolls on the effective date will receive larger benefits under thisprovision and in addition 60,000 persons\u2014workers and their depend-ents not eligible under present law\u2014will be added to the rolls.5. ELIMINATE REDUCTION IN SPOUSES' BENEFITS IN CERTAIN CASESUnder present law, when a woman applies for a retirement benefitprior to age 65, it is computed under the actuarial reduction formula;if she later applies for a spouse's benefit, it is reduced in the sameproportion as her retirement benefit. The bill would eliminate theactuarial reduction in such cases when the spouse's benefit is appliedfor. The same rule would apply to dependent husbands entitled tospouse's or widower's benefits. Approximately 100,000 beneficiarieswould be affected by this provision, which will result in additionalbenefit payments estimated at $10 million during the first 12 months.6. DIsABILITY BENEFITS FOR BLIND PERSONSUnder present law one of the general requirements for disabilityinsurance benefits is that the disabled person must have worked5 out of the 10 years before he becomes disabled. This requirementwould he dropped for blind people. As a result a blind person couldqualify for benefits when he had sufficient work to qualify for retire-ment benefits.7. WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION OFFSET FOR DISABILITY INSURANCEBENEFICIARIESUnder present law a disability insurance beneficiary who alsoqualifies for workmen's compensation has his Social Security benefitreduced so that his combined payment will not be more than 80 per-cent of his average earnings bdore he became disabled. Under thebill the combined payments allowable would be raised to 100 percentof his average earnings. 38. MILITARY SERVICE CREDITPresent law provides fora credit of $100 a month, in addition to pay, for military service performed after 1967. This credit would also be provided for service provided from 1957, the date military service was covered under social security. Approximately 130,000 beneficiaries will be affected immediately.$35 million in additional benefits will be paid out in the first 12 months.9. DISABLED CHILDRENUnder present lawa person disabled prior toage 18 may continue to receive a child's benefit without regard to his age foras long as he is disabled. Under the bill persons disabled prior to age 22 couldqualify for such a disabled child's benefit.10. OTHER AMENDMENTSThe Committee also adopted other amendments relatingto Social Security coverage for policemen and firemen in Idaho, thecoverage of home Loan Bank employees, the treatment of earningsof self- employed persons paying taxes on a fiscal year basis, the treatment of earnings under the retirement test of persons in theyear they attain age 72, and payment of disability insurance benefits on the basis of applications filed after the death of the disabled person.11. FINANCINGIn order to pay the additional cost of the new benefits provided and to meet the existing actuarial deficit in the hospital insurance (part A of Medicare)program, the tax base would be increased from $7,800 a year to $9,000a year, starting January 1, 1971, and a new schedule of tax rates would be provided as follows: finpercentj OASDIHIJanuary1,1971 8.42 JsuaryI,1975 10. 02 January1,to 11.02II. AMENDMENTSRELATEDTOTHEMEDICARE, MEDICAID AND MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH PROGRAMSCOVERAGE AND BENEFIT CHANGES UNDER MEDICARE1. Relationship Between Medicare and Federal Employees Benefits.\u2014 No payment would be made under medicare for servicescovered under a Federal Employees Health Benefits plan effective with January 1, 1972, unless in the meantime the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare determines that theFederal Employees Health Benefits Pro- gram has been modified to make available coverage supplementary to medicare benefits and toassure that Federal employees reaching age 65 will continue to have the benefit of the government contribution towardshealthinsurance.2. Hospital Insurance for the Uninsnred.\u2014People reaching age 65 who are ineligible for hospital insurance benefits undermedicare 4would be able to enroll, on a voluntary basis, for hospital insurancecoverage under the sameconditions under which people can enrollunder the supplementary medical insurance part of medicare, providedthat those who enroll must pay the full cost of the protection\u2014$27a month at the beginningof the program, rising as hospital costs rise.States and other organizations would be permitted to purchase suchprotection on a group basis for their retired employees age 65 or over.3. Health Maintenance Organization Option.\u2014Individuals eligible forboth Part A and Part B medicare coverage would be able to chooseto have their care provided by a health maintenance organization (aprepaid group health or other capitation plan). The government wouldpay for such coverage on acapitation basis not to exceed 95% of thecost of medicare benefits provided to beneficiaries in the area notcovered under the health maintenance organization.IMPROVEMENTS IN THE OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF THE MEDICARE,MEDICAID AND MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH PROGRAMS1. Limitation on Federal Payment for DisapprovedExpenditures.\u2014Reimbursement amounts to providers of health services under medi-caid, medicare, and maternal and child health for capital costs, suchas depreciation and interest,would not be made with respect tocapital expenditures (in excess of $100,000) which are inconsistent withstate or local health facility plans.2. Experiments and Projects in Prospective Reimbursement andIncentives for Economy.\u2014The Secretary of Health, Education, andWelfare would he required to develop experiments and demonstrationj)rojects designed to test various methods of making payment toproviders of services on a prospective basis under medicare, medicaidand maternal and child health. In addition, the Secretary would beauthorized to conduct experiments with methods of payment orreimbursement designed to increase efficiency and economy, and withcommunity-wide utilization review mechanisms.3. Limits on Costs Recognized as Reasonable.\u2014The Secretary ofHealth, Educution, and Welfare would be given authority to establishand promulgate limits on provider costs to be recognized as reasonableunder medicare based on comparisons of the cost of covered servicesby various classes of providers in the same geographical area. Hospitalsand extended care facilities could charge beneficiaries for the care notcovered (except in the case of an admission by a physician who ownsan interest in the facility).4. Limitation on Recognition of Physician Fee Increases.\u2014Chargesdetermined to be reasonable under the present criteria in the medicare,medicaid, and maternal and child health law would be limited byproviding: (a) that for fiscal year 1971 medical charge levels recog-nized as prevailing may not be increased beyond the 75th percentileof actual charges in a locality during calendar year 1969; (b) that forfiscal year 1972 and thereafter the prevailing charge levels recognizedfor a locality may be increased, on the average, only to the extentjustified by increases in the cost of production of medical services,levels of living and the earnings of other professional, managerial andtechnical personnel; and (c) that for medical supplies, equipment andservices that, in the judgment of the Secretary, gencrai.y do not varysignificantly in quality from one supplier to another, charges allowed aas reasonable may not exceed the lowest levels at which such supplies, equipment and servicesare widely available in a locality.5. Changes in Federal Matching Percentages with Respect to Certain Services.\u2014The Federal medicaid matching for certain outpatient services would be increased and the Federal matching with respect to long-term institutionalcare would be decreased and certain otherlimitations would be imposed. Specifically, (1) the Federal matching percentage for outpatient hospital services, clinic services and home health services would be increased by 25 percent; (2) the Federal percentage after the first 60 days of care in a general or TB hospital would be reduced by one-third; (3) the Federal percentage after the first 90 days of care ina year in a skilled nursing home would be re- duced by one-third; (4) the Federal matching for care ina mental hospital after 90 days ofcare would be reduced by one-third and no Federal matching would be available after 275 days of suchcare during an individual's lifetime; and (5) the Secretary would be authorized to compute a reasonable cost differential for reimbursementpurposes between skilled nursing homes and intermediate care facilities. 6. Payments for Services of Teaching Physicians.\u2014Medjcare and medicaid would not pay for the services of teaching physicians unless other patients who have insurance or are able to pay are also charged for such services and the medicare deductibles and coinsurance amounts are regularly collected. Medicare payment would 'be au- thorized for services to hospital patients by staff of certain medical schools that now furnish these services without charge to the hospital. 7. Termination of Payments to Providers Who Abuse the Medicare Program.\u2014The Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare would be given authority to terminate or suspend payment for services rendered by a supplier of health and medical services found to be guilty of program abuses. Program review teams would be established to furnish the Secretary professional advice in carrying out this authority.8. Repeal of Medicaid Provision Requiring Expanded Programs.\u2014 The requirement in present law that States have comprehensive medicaid programs by 1977 would be repealed. 9. State Determination of Reasonable Hospital Costs.\u2014States would be permitted to pay hospitals on the basis of their own determinationof reasonable cost, provided there is assurance that the medicaid program would pay the actual cost of coverage of hospitalization of medicaid recipients.10. Government Payment No Higher Than Charges.\u2014Payments for services under the medicare, medicaid, and maternal and child health programs would not be higher than the charges regularly made for those services.11. Institutional Bvdgeting.\u2014Health institutions under thesepro- grams would be required to have a written plan reflecting an operating budget and a capital expenditures budget. 12. Federal Matching for Modern, Claims Processrng Systems.\u2014 Federal matching at the90-percent rate would be available undermedicaid for the states to set up mechanized claims processing and informational retrieval systems. Federal matching for the continuous operation of such systems would be at the 75-percent rate. 13. Guarantee of PaVment for Extended Care Services.\u2014The Secre- tary of Health, Education, and 'Welfare would establish specific periods 6of time (by medical condition) after hospitalization during which apatient would be presumed to require extended care level of servicesin an extended care facility. Similar provision would be made for post-hospital home health services.14. Prohibition of Reassignments.\u2014Medicare and medicaid pay-ments to anyone other than a patient or his physician would be prohibited, unless the physician is required as a condition of hisemployment to turn over his fees to his employer or unless there is acontractual arrangement between the physician and the facility inwhich the services were provided under which the facility bills for allsuch services.15. Utilization Review in Medieaid.\u2014Require hospitals and skillednursing homes participating in the medicaid and maternal and childhealth programs to have the same utilization review committee withthe same functions as in the medicare program.16. Medicaid Deductible8 for the Medically Indigent.\u2014States wouldbe permitted to impose a flat deductible or cost sharing provision withrespect to people eligible under medicaid programs but not eligiblefor cash public assistance payments. (Present law requires such de-ductible or cost sharing to vary directly with the amount of the re-cipient's income.)17. Stop-xing Payment Where Hospital Admission Not Necessary.\u2014If the utilization review committee of a hospital or extended carefacility in its sample review of admissions finds a case where institu-tionalization is no longer necessary, then payment would be cut offafter 3 days. This provision parallel sthe provision in present law underwhich long-stay cases are cut off after 3 days when the utilizationreview committee determines that institutionalization is no longerrequired.18. Role of State Health Agencies in Medicaid.\u2014State health agen-cies would be required to perform certain functions under the medicaidand maternal and child health programs relating to the quality of thehealth care furnished to recipients.MISCELLANEOUS AND TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS1. Retroactive Coverage Under Medicaid.\u2014States would be requiredto cover under medicaid the cost of health care provided to an eligibleindividual during the 3-month perio(l before the month in which heapplie(l for medicaid.2. Cer4/icatiori of Hospitalization for Dental Care.\u2014A dentist wouldbe authorized to certify to the necessity for hospitalization to protectthe health of a medicare patient who is hospitalized for noncovered(lental procedures.3. Christian Science Sanitoria under Medicaid.\u2014Christian Sciencesanitoria would be exempted from the medicaid requirement thatthey have a licensed nursing home administrator and from otherinappropriate skilled nursing home requirements.4. Physical Therapy Services Under Medicare.\u2014Under medicare'ssup)ementary medical insurance program, beneficianes would becovered for up to $100 per calendar year of physical therapy servicesfurnished by a licensed physical therapist in his office or the patient'shome under a physician's prescription. Hospitals and extended carefacilities could continue to provide covered physical therapy services 7to inpatients who have exhausted their days of hospital insurancecoverage. Where physical therapy is furnished under contractualarrangement with a hospital or extended care facility medicare reini-bursement to the institution will in all cases be based on a reasonable salary payment for the services.5. Grace Period for Paying Medicare Premium .\u2014Where there isgood cause for a medicare beneficiary's failure to pay supplementarymedical insurance premiums, an extended grace period of 90 dayswould be provided.6. Extension of Time for Filing Medicare Glaims.\u2014The time limitfor filing supplementary medical insurance claims would be extendedwhere the medicare beneficiary's delay is due to administrative error.7. Enrollment Under Medicare.\u2014Relief would be provided where ad-ministrative error has prejudiced an individual's right to enroll inmedicare's supplementary medical insurance program. Eligible in-dividuals would be permitted to enroll under medicare's supplementarymedical insurance program during any prescribed enrollment periodand would no longer be required to enroll within 3 years followingfirst eligibility or a previous withdrawal from the program.8. Waiver of Medicare Overpayment.\u2014Where incorrect medicarepayments were made to a deceased beneficiary, the liability of sur-vivors for repayment could be waived if the survivors were withoutfault in incurring the overpayment.9. Medicare Fair Hearings.\u2014Fair hearings, held by medicare car-riers in response to disagreements over amounts paid under supple-mentary medical insurance, would be conducted only where the amountin controversy is $100 or more.10.

Chiropractors' Servicee.\u2014The Department of Health, Educa-tion, and Welfare would conduct a study on covering chiropractors'services (on a very limited 'basis) under medicare, utilizing the ex- perimental authority under the medicaid program. A report on the study, including the experience of other programs paying for chiro-practors' services would be submitted to the Congress within 2 years.0 SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION Number110 July 15, 19701970 SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATIONTo Administrative, Supervisory,and Technical Employees Yesterday, Secretary Richardson testified before the Senate Finance Committee on H. R. 17550, the 'Social Security Amendments of 1970.\" Enclosed is a copy of his prepared statement.The Finance Committee had previously, on June 17, held one day of hearings on H. R. 17550.At that time, the Assistant Secretary forLegislation, Creed C. Black, gave a short statement highlighting the most significant parts of H. R. 17,550, and I presented a series of charts explaining in greater detail the provisions of the bill.After the Secretary had finished his statement yesterday, the Committee questioned him on the various provisions of the bill. The Committee will continue questioning Department officials today.No date has yet been fixed for testimony on the bill by public witnesses. Robert M. BallCommissionerEnclosure Statementby Elliot L. Richardson,Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare,before the Committee on FinanceU.S. SenateJuly lii, 1970 Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee: I am pleased to testify before your Committee today on H.R. 17550, theSocial Security Amendments of 1970. The bill embodies practically allof the proposals submitted for the consideration of the Congress bythe President in his September 25, 1969, Message on Social Security, andother proposals, such as the Cost Effectiveness mendments of 1969, thatwere later submitted by the Administration are included in the bill.The legislation will improve the protection afforded by the socialsecurity cash-benefits program and improve the Medicare, Medicaid, andmaternal and child health programs with regard to both overall effective-ness and the potentials for control of health care costs. The Presidenthas endorsed the major provisions of the bill.Mr. Chairman, on June 17th Commissioner Ball went into some detailconcerning H.R. 17550 in his chart presentation. Today, therefore, Iwould like to confine my opening remarks to the most significant proposalsin the bill and, with your permission, submit a more detailed statementfor the record. Automatic Adjustment of Social Security Benefits H.R. 17550 provides for automatic adjustment of social security benefitsto increases in the cost of living. In my opinion, this proposal is themost important one in the bill concerning the cash-benefits program.Both political parties included it in their 1968 national conventionplatforms, and there is widespread support for it among both contributorsto the program and beneficiaries. This is a proposal whose time has come.Over the years Congress has established a policy of restoring thepurchasing power of benefits when price increases have eroded their value.Sometimes, however, there have been long periods during which benefitshave remained uichanged and beneficiaries have had to get along on thesebenefits while the cost of living increased substantially. On the other hand, the Congress has occasionally set new and higher benefit levelsthan had previously been established, actually increasing the purchasing power of the benefit in real terms.Here is what has happened: there were no general benefit increasesbetween l90, when monthly benefits were first payable, and 1950.Then the benefit level was increased to about make up for the risein prices that had occurred during the 1940's. As a result of theamendments of 1952 and 1954, the Congress established a somewhathigher level benefits in real terms. Then, during the next 15 years,three across-the-board benefit increases were enacted that approximately 2 restored the purchasing power of the benefits as they were establishedin 19514.The 15-percent benefit increase earlier this year againestablished a somewhat higher level of benefits in real terms. Although Congress has established a policy of restoring the purchasingpower of benefits, and indeed on occasion increasing the real level ofbenefits, there have been substantial time lags between the increasesIn price levels and the increase in benefits. For example, there wereno increases between 19140 and 1950, although the purchasing power ofthe benefits declined by about 37 percent.There was no general increaseIn benefits between 1959 and 1965 although the purchasing power of thebenefits declined by about 8 percent. When substantial time lags occur between increases In price levels andbenefit increases, congressional action increasing benefits cannot makeup for the hardships beneficiaries endure while awaiting such action.Older people, widows, orphans, and disabled people, who have had to getalong for years on benefits that were declining in purchasing power, havesuffered hardships during those years that cannot be overcome by a laterrestoration of the purchasing power of the benefits. The automatic adjustment provision controls the time lag and addspredictability to the Increase. Writing the established congressionalpolicy Into the law will give both beneficiaries and covered workers thepeace of mind that comes with the certainty that the purchasing power oftheir benefits will not be eroded by future price Increases. Had thisprovision been in effect during the last 15 years, Instead of the fourbenefit increases that occurred in 1959, 1965, 1968, and 1970, therewould have been seven benefit Increases. Thus, beneficiaries who wereon the rolls during those years would have had the purchasing power oftheir benefits maintained throughout the period at a level much closerto the purchasing power of the benefit level established in 19514. Thesomewhat higher level of benefits established this year would haverequired congressional action.To take account of price increases occurring during this calendar year,1970, the bill provides an across-the-board 5-percent increase in benefitseffective January 1, 1971. The 5-percent benefit increase will go tomore than 26 million beneficiaries and will total $1.7 billion during thefirst 12 months the Increase Is in effect. The first automatic benefitIncrease could take place In January 1973, based on an increase in thecost of living from 1971 to 1972, If that increase is at least 3 percent. Increase in the Contribution and Benefit Base The House bill also provides for Increases in the contribution, andbenefit base--the amount of a worker's annual earnings that is subjectto social security contributions and counted towards social securitybenefits.The base would be increased from the present $7800 to $9000effective for 1971. Thereafter, the base would be automaticallY adjustedon a regularbasIs--b1t no more often than once in 2 years--as earning8levels rise. 3TheCongresshas clearly established a policy of adjusting the contribution and benefit base as earnings levels rise, just as it has with respect to the adjustment of benefits to prices.Here again, a provision for automatic Increases in the base to keep It in line with increases In earnings levels would write into the law already established Congressional policy, thus giving greater assurance to workers who earn higherwages In the future thatthey will get credittoward benefits for thosehigher earnings. The automatic increases in the base, in line with rising wages, would also provide adequate financing for the automatic benefit increases.The contribution and benefit base was originally established at $3000 in1935.Noaction wastakento increase the base until 1950, when It was set at $3600. At this level it covered 81 percent of payrolls and all of the earnings of a little over 75percentof covered workers. Since that time, through legislative changes, thepercentage of payrolls covered has been maintained at about 80 percent, and the percentage of covered workers who have all their earnings covered has been maintained atabout 75to80 percent.The increase in thebaseto $9000in 1971 willrestore the relationship between the base and earnings levels gener- ally that was established in 1950 and that has been maintained by Congress over the last 20 years, and the provision In the bill for automatic adjustment in the base wouldmean that similar relationships would be maintained automatically.These provisions would not delegate to the executive branch any discretion whatsoever. The power to increase taxes would remain in the hands of the Congress. What this provision does Is to provide a specific formula in the law that determines what the social security tax base shall be.The base would be increased Only in directproportion to increases in average earnings for all workers in covered employment.Retirement TestH.R. 17550 improves the social security program's retirement test. This is the provision under which social security benefits for an Individual under age 72 are withheld or reduced If he earns more than the exempt amount--currently $1680-- in any year.In his Message to the Congress last September the President expressed his concern about this provision.He said:\"The present retirement test actually penalizes social security beneficiaries for doing additional work or taking a job at higher pay.This 18 wrong.As you know, the Congress has on a number of occasions made changesdesigned to minimize this effect. Yet, a problem remains under thepresent retirement test because benefits are reduced dollar-for-dollaron earnings above $2880 in a year. Because of taxes and work expenses,a beneficiary's spendable income--that Is, his social security benefitsplus his earnings after taxes--may be less if he earns somewhat more 1.than$2880thanhis income would be if he had earned less than $2880.Thebill remedies this by eliminating the dollar-for-dollar reductionand providing that social security benefits be reduced by only $1 foreach $2 of earnings above the annual exempt amount,, regardless of howmuch Is earned.The bill also increases the retirement test annual exempt amount from$1680to$2000.This change takes account of increases In generalearnings levels that have occurred since the present $1680 exemptamount became effective. Thebill also provides for the future automatic upward adjustment ofthe retirement test as earnings levels rise, similar to the automaticadjustment provision for raising the contribution and benefit base.This change would prevent hardships to beneficiaries that have sometimesoccurred because there was a lag In updating the test. The retirement test changes in the bill would result In about $570million In additional benefits being paid in 1971. Thesebenefits wouldgo to about 1.3 million beneficiaries, including 1400,000 who would notreceive benefits under present law.Increase In Widow's BenefitsSurveys of social security beneficiaries show that, as a group, widowshave less regular Income than most other classes of beneficiaries andin general are financially worse off. Under present law, a widowcannot be paid more than 82-1/2 percent of the benefit amount her hus-band would have received If he started getting benefits at or afterage 65.Webelieve that a widow should not be expected to live on lessthan her liusband would have been paid if he had lived.H.R. 17550 would Increase benefits for aged widows and widowers. Forthose who become entitled to benefits at or after age 65, thebenefitamount would be Increased to 100 percent of' the amount which the widow'sdeceased husband would have received If he had lived and his benefitshad started at or after age 65. Forthose becoming entitled to benefitsbefore age 65,the100-percent amount would be reduced In a way similarto the way in which the worker's benefit is reduced If he elects toreceive it before age 65. Some3.3millionwidows and widowers on the rolls at the end of January1971 would receive higher benefits under this provision. Additionalbenefit payments in the first 12 months would total $700 million. Uniform Computation Method for Men and WomenUnder present law, the computation of retirement benefits for men Isdifferent from the computation for women. The re&u.lt Is that a man 5whohas had the same earnings as a woman may in many cases get benefitsthat are lover than hers. Under the bill, benefits for men would becalculated in the same way as they are for women under present law. Asa result, the retirement benefits payable to men, the benefits payableto their wives, and the benefits payable to survivors of men who livebeyond age 62 would be increased.Approximately 10 million people on the rolls in January 1971 would havetheir benefits increased under this provision, and additional numberswould become eligible for benefits in the future because of the changein the eligibility requirements. In the first 12 months after theprovision goes into effect an additional $925 million in benefits wouldbe paid. MEDICARE AND MEDICAID PROVISIONSMr. Chairman, the Committee will recall that when HEW representativestestified here in February, they emphasized the need to take steps toencourage changes in structure and to improve the operation of theNatio&s health care delivery system. Inefficiencies and discontinuitiesin that system underlie a significant part of the extraordinary increasein the costs of health care that has been experienced throughout theNation in recent years. It is one of the highest-priority objectivesof this Administration to have government programs contribute to improv-ing the Nation's health-care system to the greatest extent possible.We believe that the Medicare and Medicaid programs have a specialresponsibility in this regard.MEDICAREWith about 20 million people protected under the hospital insurance partof Medicare and more than 19 million people enrolled in the medicalinsurance part, this program is the major federally operated healthinsurance plan and, indeed, by far the largest single plan in the UnitedStates.Overall, Medicare payments in fiscal year 1969 accounted forabout 70 percent of the expenditures of the aged for hospital andphysicians' care. We believe that Medicare, which has done much toalleviate the financial burden of health care for the aged, can be apowerful force in improving the system on which we all rely for healthcare.There are four major provisions In H.R. 17550 designed to affect overthe long run the cost of delivering quality health care to the Americanpeople.One of the most significant of these provisions Is the onewhich would establish, under Medicare, a health maintenance organizationoption.Health Maintenance Organization OptionWe believe that enactment of the lIMO option will have the effect ofstimulating the Nation's voluntary health system to offer new choicesto individuals and families and to organize new ways of deliveringhealth care. 6Underthis provision, doctors, hospitals, and other providers ofservice could receive payments from the public programs under termsthat encourage prudent management of utilization.Several types of existing health organizations and plans have shownevidence that payment arrangements with physicians can make a differencein the utilization of a broad spectrum of health services. Payment tothese organizations on a per capita instead of a straight fee-for-servicebasis provides incentives for early diagnosis and treatment, an importantfactor in the success the organizations have had in reducing the incidenceand duration of high-cost institutional care. This method of paymentalso shifts motivation away from the provision of high cost services andtowards the provision of less expensive levels of medically appropriatecare.We believe that with encouragemenj by the Federal Government andwith the removal of legal barriers which exist at the State level, moreof these organizations can be developed. Health maintenance organizations are, essentially, organizations whichwill contract to provide to Medicare eligibles all services covered byPartA and Part B of the program in return for a fixed annual paymentper enrollee.The fixed annual sum, which would be determined in advance,would be less than the Government now pays on the average for conven-tional Medicare benefits.Prospective payments to health maintenance organizations (HMO's) would bedetermined annually, taking into account theorganization's regular premiums, and would not exceed 95 percentofaverageper capita payments under Parts A and B In the locality (withappropriateactuarial adjustments for expected cost differentials duetosuch factors as age and sex variations in membership composition ofan organization). Thus, the economic Incentive of the provider and thehealth Interests of consumer more closely align because the providerbears the financial risk of Ill health. Both parties will have, there-fore, an Interest in the maintenance of good health. When a health maintenance organization offers membership opportunItiesin a community, the individual Medicare beneficiary could choose whetherto continue under the present Parts A and B arrangements or to elect theHMO option.For Medicaid recipients, sufficient authority currentlyexistsunder title XIX for the States to contract with these same healthmaintenance organizations to provide a defined scope of services, on anegotiated per capita basis.This proposal represents a significant departure from the more traditionalapproach in which the Individual patient must largely find his own wayamong the various types and levels of services. Under the health mainten-ance organization option, a single organization will have the responsibilityfor determining the covered services a patient needs and then deliveringthose services.These two features of the proposal--first, the introduction of economicincentives to control unnecessary utilization and assure effective earlytreatment; and second, the requirement that an HMO be responsible for allphases of covered services--will result in a greater assurance ofmedicallyappropriate care. 7.There are a variety of health maintenance organizations already in existence.I would like to emphasize, however, that we do not think any particular structure or Sponsorship is a prerequisite for a health maintenance organization. Indeed, we think the country will benefit, by diversity and competition among different kinds of HMO's and between HMO's and other providers of health care.One of our goals is to open the market place and provide opportunities fornew delivery systems. The capacity of existing HMOts (essentially, group practice prepayment plans) is limited, so that only a very small proportion of Medicare and Medicaid recipients will, in the beginning, be able to receive services through them.We hope that RHO's,andtheir use by beneficiaries, will expand greatly in the future, and we believe that there can be significant long-run savings in program costs due to the HMO option. Prospective ReimbursementWhen representatjs of the Department last discussed the Medicare and Medicaid programs before this Committee, we urged moving as quickly as possible to a system of prospective reimbursement to institutional providersunder these programs.The House has endorsed theprinciple of prospectivereimbursement and hasdirected the Department to experiment with and evaluate alternative methods for setting reimbursement on a prospective basis, and to recom- mend to the Congress by July of 1972 specific methods for the full implementation of a prospective reimbursement system. This is a major step forward.We recommend, however, that the House-passed bill be revised to provide authority for the Department to implement desirable methods for reimbursement as SOOn as they can be worked out by agreement with providers, without having to wait for further congressional action. We think that statutory language requiring that the Committees receive reports on the proposed experiments and projects before they can be implemented is unnecessary. Such a requirement could result in delays in the implementation of projects. Considering the fact that a great deal of research and analysis must be completed within a very short period of time, any delays in implementing projects and experiments may be costly.For this reason, we recommend the deletion of the reporting requirement in section 222.Reimbursement of PractitionersAnother major change relating to Medicare reimbursement that was recommended by th Administration and adopted by the House is one that would make Medicare recognition of prevailing charge levels for medical services more closely related to general economic trends.Under thisprovision, physicians would still ordinarily be reimbursed on the basisof the customary charge that they made for a specific procedure to their patients generally. However, the overall maximum set in terms of theprevailing charges in a community would be allowed to rise in the futureonly in relation to rises in prices and the general earnings level. 8Itis true that over the long-run past physicians' fees have not risenquite as fast as earnings generally, and if this were to continue to bethe case, the proposed amendment would ordinarily not have any effect.However, the amendment is needed as a guarantee that this would indeedbe the case in the future. We are faced with a substantial shortage ofphysicians in a period of rapidly increasing demand, and there may be,therefore, a tendency for fees to rise out of proportion to othereconomic indices.PlanningAlthough there is a clear need to achieve balance in and improveddistribution of health-care facilities, there is also a need to assurethat improvements will be accomplished in ways which avoid the duplica-tion or random growth of health care facilities that would result ininefficient use of the facilities and, therefore, in unduly high healthcare costs.Under H.R. 17550, the Secretary of Health, Education, andWelfare would be given authority to withhold or reduce reimbursement toproviders of service for depreciation and interest for capital expendi-tures that are found to be inconsistent with State or local healthfacility plans. The Secretary determination would be based on findingsand recommendations submitted by qualified planning agencies In theStates--organizations which have consumer representation and which wiUbe designated by agreement between each State and the Department. Ifthe Secretary determines, however, after consultation with a nationaladvisory council, that withholding or reduction of reimbursement in agiven case would be inconsistent with effective organization and deliveryof health services he would be authorized to make reimbursement withoutsuch withholding or reduction. As the Committee will recall, a proposalwith the same general objectives passed the Senate in 1967. Other Medicare ProvisionsThe House-passed bill contains a considerable number of other Medicareprovisions which I have not discussed. In large part, these provisionsare aimed at Improving the operating effectiveness and the administrationof the Medicare program. They include the Administration's Health CostEffectiveness Amendments, previously presented to this Committee. Amongthese proposed amendments are those relating to authority to terminatepayments to suppliers of services who abuse the Medicare program, authoritytobase payments to institutional providers on charges where these areless thancost, and expanded authority to conduct experiments and demonstra-tion projects to develop incentives for economy in the provision of healthservices.In addition, the bill makes provision for advance approval ofbenefits for extended care and home health services.Under this provision,the Secretary would be authorized to establish specific periods of time,related to medical condition, during which a patient would be presumed,for payment purposes, to require a level of institutional services avail-able only in an extended-care-facility setting. 9Reviewof Utilization The most difficult, as well as the most important, area of programcontrols relates to determinations of medical necessity for the volume and type of service provided. These determinations, of course, can be made only by the medical profession reviewing the actions of its own members.There are several features of the present law which are directed to this problem, including the requirements of a physician'scertification of medical necessity for many types of service and therequirements for utilization review committees in hospitals and extended care facilities. The House bill provides for some additional strengthening in this area by, for example, modifying utilization review procedures to allow for payment cutoff when unnecessary utilization is discovered in the course of a sample review of hospital admissions. In addition, the bill authorizesexperiments with the use of areawide utilization review mechanisms.However, this is an exceedingly difficult area of administration, and wewelcome the opportunity to examine additional approaches which might have the effect of strengthening peer review of the utilization of medical services.The approach recently outlined by Senator Bennett, for example,represents a possibility that might be most helpful.As is indicated in the Senator's statement appearing in the CongressionalRecord of July 1, the objective of greater physician participation in and responsibility for reviewing and evaluating utilization cannot be imple-mented at once, but will require a great deal of careful planning. It would be impossible, for example, and I believe in many ways undesirable,to supplant entirely the present Medicare administrative system of con-ducting utilization reviews and to substitute new review organizations.Even in areas where review organizations exist, it may be both desirableand necessary to approach their full implementation in stages.The Senator's proposal warrants careful consideration, and the Departmentis eager to collaborate with the Committee in developing a Sound andeffective system of professional peer review. MEDICAIDAs I have stated earlier, I believe we are now at a time when significantnew Federal initiatives should be taken in the health field. You are allaware of the President's announcement of June 10 that this Administrationis committed to the reform of the Medicaid program and to the developmentand implementation of a Family Health Insurance Program for low-incomefamilies.We believe that this proposal, which we will discuss with youin more detail in the future, will effectively integrate the Nation'smajor health program for the poor with the proposed Family AssistanceProgram (FAP). This strategy will fundamentally restructure the Medicaidprogram for families with children. 10 In addition, there are other, less critical, changes which should bemade at this time. Let me turn the Committee's attention for a moment,if I may, to some of the strengths and weaknesses of the current Medicaidprogram. Few can deny that the title XIX program has moved a long way in a shorttime toward achieving its goal of improving the availability and accessi-bility of medical care and services for the Nation's poor.More than 12million people will receive medical care with Medicaid's help this year.This is more than double the number who received Federally-aided medicalassistance in 1965. Medicaid is providing health care for children whose families have enoughmoney for their daily needs but not enough for special medical needs.From 1965 to 1969 the number of children who received Federally-supportedmedical assistance rose from 1.5 million to 5.9 million;about half thechildren in the latter group were not in families receiving AFDC payments.We believe itisimportant to recognize the achievements of this programandto maintain our commitment to improving and expanding health programs for the poor until medical services are available to all who require thembut cannot afford to pay.Clearly, however, there have been serious problems with the Medicaidprogram;the ability to finance care doesn't guarantee the availability,adequacy, or reasonable cost of care. The health system has severeproblems in the supply and distribution of facilities, manpower, andservices, as well as in the organization and delivery of care. In addition, the Medicaid program itself has been difficult to administer--partly because of the title XIX legislation, partly because of the natureand administration of the welfare program it has supplemented, and partlybecause Medicaid has been a Federal-State program. Medicaid, as you know,has operated not as one but as 52 separate and distinct programs.Eachprogram is different in design, varying according to the people it covers,and in the services offered. Serious geographic and other inequities have,therefore, resulted. We know that Medicaid has been an expensive program placing heavy fiscalburdens on the States and the Federal Government. Because of programvariations, a disproportionate share of Federal matching funds has beenspentin support of programs in only a few of our States.We have been aware of the need to undertake fundamental reforms of theMedicaid program to deal with these prpblems. We were also concerned with thedifficulties pointed out by your Committee, of meshing the currentMedicaid program with a reformed welfare system. The \"sudden death\" lossof Medicaid benefits when income reaches a specified level--the so-called\"notch\" problem--is an unacceptable defect in the current structure ofMedicaid. 11I can assure you that the Department has given the most seriousconsideration to these issues. They are not problems which lend them-selves to easy or quick solutions. Some months' time will be necessarybefore we can present you with our final legislative proposals on theFamily Health Insurance Program and with the related proposals dealingwith broad reforms in our health care system. We will continue to workwith the Committee staff as we develop these proposals.In the meantime, we believe there are important immediate steps that canand should be taken immediately to amend title XIX to make it a moreeffective and economical vehicle for financing health care. We thinkthese improvements should be made before the Family Health Insurance Planbecomes an operating program, since title XIX will continue to supporthealth care for those in the adult assistance programs.We propose to require that the State health agency be responsible forestablishing and maintaining health standards for institutions in whichtitle XIX beneficiaries receive care and services. The same agency shallbe responsible for maintaining, to the maximum extent practical, uniformityor consistency of determinations relating to eligibility of Institutionsfor participation In the titles XVIII, XIX, and V programs.As your Committee has pointed out, some of the most serious problems ofMedicaid relate to the lack of adequate information systems for surveil-lance, rigorous claims review, utilization review, and program evaluation.This is caused in part by the lack of capability in the States to developthe necessary systems. We are, therefore, requesting authorization forFederal payment of 90 percent of the costs incurred by the States in thedesign, development, and installation of mechanized claims processingand Information systems. The Federal Government would also pay 75 percentof the cost of operating such approved systems. States would not beeligible to receive this increased Federal support until they havedeveloped the capacity to furnish each recipient with a notice and explana-tion of health care paid for on his behalf by the program- -a suggestionmade by this Committee. We are currently designing information systemsfor the States to use as models.Providers have been reluctant In many instances to care for potentialMedicaid eligibles because frequently the patient has not applied forMedicaid prior to his Illness and, therefore, the providers would not beeligible to receive payment for their services. Thirty-one States havedealt with this problem by providing payment for care of eligibles forperiods up to 3monthsprior to the month of application. We propose tomake 3monthsretroactive coverage mandatory on all States having titleXIX programs.This bill also includes a pi-ovision, in line with earlier suggestions'by the Congress, to prohibit reassignment of benefits, except in specifiedcases, in order to prevent vendor payments from being made to independentcollection and bill discount agencies. 12We are hopeful that in this, and other programs, we will establish amore consistent policy of aiding the States to help themselves. Althoughwe will provide technical assistance and models, the States will beencouraged to develop and operate their own systems. Medicaid Reimbursement ChangesThe President, in his message sent to the Congress on February 26,suggested changes in the Federal matching percentage for medical assistancethat would encourage States to substitute less expensive care for moreexpensive care when it is equally beneficial. Our proposal, adopted inthe House-passed bill, provides for increased matching to encourage useof selected outpatient health services and for decreased Federal matchingto discourage the States from permitting overutilization of institutionalservices.This provision would permit the Federal Government to institute a reasonablecost differential between reimbursement made to skilled nursing homes andto intermediate care facilities, thereby incorporating another usefulsuggestion made earlier by your Committee. Reimbursement disincentives fornursing home care are expected to increase placement of patients in inter-mediate care facilities (institutions that provide care that is morecustodial in nature and at a more appropriate level for many of those innursing home and mental institutions) and use of home health services. Experimental AuthorityWe are aware of your Committee's concern about ways to restrain theIncreases in cost arising from the relatively open-ended Medicaid program,including the use of insurance carriers, capitation arrangements, andchanges relating to eligibility. We agree that there are apparent defectsthat will be remedied ultimately only by changing the structure of theprogram.&itwhilewe are moving toward a complete change in the program'snature, we need to gain experience with different approaches to providingthe benefits, different approaches to eligibility, underwriting, adminis-tration, and organization and delivery of services. We are, therefore, asking Congress to make changes in title XIX toauthorize the States to conduct experiments on a Statewide, areawide,county, city, or neighborhood basis. We are interested in encouragingexperiments with pre-enrollment of adult categories on an annual basis,the use of different combinations of benefits and different types ofbenefit packages for different population groips, and limited use ofcopayments and deductibles for medically needy. We need to experiment in the way of risk-sharing with private insurancecompanies, foundations, prepaid group practices, and health maintenanceorganizations. We would use the authority in this provision to experimentin these types of areas: purchasing private insurance for Medicaideligibles, capitation or contract payments to States for specified groups,and capitation arrangements with prepaid groups, neighborhood health centers,foundations, and medical societies. 13We are also proposing that the Secretary be permitted, through experimentsor demonstration projects, to make payment to organizations and institu-tions for services which are not currently covered under titles V, XVIII,and XIX.These new services would have to be provided in addition toservices already covered under these programs, and their inclusion wouldhave to offer the promise of program savings without any loss in thequality of care. The Secretary could also authorize experimentation withthe use of rates established by a State for administration of one or moreof its own laws for payment or reimbursement to health facilities locatedin such State. FINANCING PROVISIONS FOR SOCIAL SECURITYCASH BENEFITS AND MEDICARETomeetthe cost of the proposed changes in the social security cash-benefitsprogramand to bring the hospital insurance program into closer actuarialbalance,H.R. 17550 would revise the social security contribution-rateschedules.Under present law, the current contribution rate for cash bene-fits of 11.2 percent each for employees and employers is scheduled to go to11.6percentfor 1971 and 1912 and to 5.0 percent for 1973 and after.Under this schedule, there would be unnecessarily large accumulations inthe trust funds in the near-future years. For example, the funds wouldincrease by $7billionin 1911, about $8billionin 1972, about $12 1/2billion in 1973, and much more in future years. Under the bill, for these reasons, the present rate of #.2 percent forthe cash-benefits program would remain in effect through 1971, would goto 5.0 percent for 1975 through 1979, and then would rise to an ultimaterate of 5.5percentfor 1980 and after. Maintaining the present rate of14.2 percent through 19714 is consistent with past decisions by the Congressto delay scheduled increases in the rates so as to avoid unnecessarilylarge accumulations in the cash benefit trust funds. Under the bill, thefunds would increase by $1.6 billion in 1971, $2.1 billion in 1972, and$3.3billionin 1973.The bill would also make changes in the contribution rate scheduled forthe hospital insurance program. The hospital insurance fund requiresadditional income over and above that scheduled under present law innear-future years. Under the bill, the contribution rate scheduled for1911 and 1972 would be Increased from 0.6 percent for employees, employers,and the self-employed to 1 percent each. The rate would then be kept at1 percent.Under present law it would be gradually increased from 0.6percent in 1970 to 0.9 percent in 1987 and after.With the revisions in the contribution-rate schedules, the combinedcontribution rate for cash benefits plus hospital insurance in 1971 wouldbe 5.2 percent each for employees and employers--the same as present law.The actuarial balances would be -0.15 percent of taxable payroll for thecash benefits program and -0.11 percent of taxable payroll for thehospital Insurance program. The estimate for the hospital insurance pro-gram takes no account of the saving that should result from the cost-control lii. provisions of the bill, and not taking account of these potentialsavings represents some margin of safety. The long-range deficit of0.11 percent of payroll indicated in the estimates, if it actually doesdevelop, would not result in a decline in the HI trust fund before atleast 15 years from now. CONCLUSION These then, Mr. Chairman, are the major provisions cf H.R. 17550. Wethink they go a long waytowardimproving all of the programs affected.The Administration, as you know, is continuing to study the socialsecurity program with the aid of the statutory Advisory Council on SocialSecurity, which Secretary Finch appointed in May 1969. Werecognize thatthere are several social security matters of' importanceto members of' thisCommittee and other members of the Senate that are not included inH.R. 17550.These matters will be included in the study being made bythe Council, which is reviewing every social security proposal pendingbefore the Congress. As you know, the Council is required to study allaspects of the program and to submit its findings and recommendationsnot later than January 1, 1971.Mr. Chairman, I would like to offer one important cautionary note. TheFederal budget is severely strained. I urge this committee to weighthis carefully in its consideration of H.R. 17550. Substantial changes,particularly in total costs or financing techniques, might upset thedelicate balance with the requirements of our economy that this bill nowenjoys.I sincerely hope that the principal features of this bill remainintact, so that its prompt enactment into law can be assured. For the present I believe the changes in H.R. 17550 represent significantprogress, and I urge enactment of the bill with the changes I havementioned and the more minor ones referred to in the statement I will besubmitting for the record.
