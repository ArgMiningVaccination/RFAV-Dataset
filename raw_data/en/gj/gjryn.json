Our research focuses on how to promote a healthy immune system. We are interested in how immunity can be manipulated against acute infections or during chronic inflammatory diseases, particularly for mucosal surfaces. Ongoing areas of research include: (1) the ADP-ribosylation enterotoxin proteins derived from heat-labile toxin of E. coli (LT) as adjuvants for vaccines to promote protective immunity (against flu, TB, Polio, ETEC diseases), (2) how inflammation or disease alters age-related immunity and vaccine efficacy, and (3) whether novel derivatives of LT that dampen inflammation can function as a unique inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) therapy.
