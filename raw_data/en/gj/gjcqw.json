Your body is equipped with [detoxification pathways](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26026145) to remove toxins so you can enjoy optimal health. Unfortunately, higher levels of toxic exposure in our daily environment mean the pathways get overburdened and toxins [accumulate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4712864/). It may be time to aid your body in detoxification if you're experiencing these symptoms of toxin overload: - Bad breath or body odor - Depression - Excess body weight - Fatigue - Lack of energy or mental clarity - Poor digestion - Skin blemishes - Stress - Unhealthy cravings - Weakened immune system You might be thinking...is detox really that important? To answer, let's consider the impact of detoxification on your overall quality of life. Here are some of the most rewarding benefits you'll experience by supporting your body with a detoxification protocol: Physical Benefits The most noticeable benefits of balanced, healthy detoxification are typically physical. When toxins [build up](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4566437/) in major organs such as your liver, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, and skin, they can also migrate into your bloodstream and brain. As you detox, you may notice sustained energy as your body has to work less to keep itself clean. Pair that with [shedding](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5438379/) unwanted pounds, fresher breath, clear eyes, and glowing skin and you'll start to reap the emotional benefits of detoxification. Emotional Benefits Witnessing the physical effects of detoxification can make you feel better, more stable, centered, and balanced. Excess toxins resulting in adrenal fatigue can lead to [symptoms](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/endocrine-diseases/adrenal-insufficiency-addisons-disease/symptoms-causes) such as moodiness and insomnia. As you detox your liver and strengthen your adrenals, you'll likely sleep more soundly, wake feeling refreshed, and find you're able to manage stressful situations more easily. You may be surprised how quickly you're able to flush toxic emotions like anger or fear and replace them with positive, uplifting feelings. Mental Benefits The mental benefits of detoxification amplify the emotional benefits. When dealing with toxin overload, you may experience brain fog that inhibits your productivity and mental health. As brain fog lifts during detox, you can experience a renewed sense of purpose, focus, motivation, and mental strength that increases your ability to control cravings and overcome addictions to alcohol, drugs, sugar, and other unhealthy habits. Memory may also be improved as your mind is freed from unwanted thought patterns of self-doubt, anxiety, and uncertainty. Some people actually find themselves renewed by the mental and emotional wellbeing that results from detox practices and change their entire lifestyle to continue reaping the rewards. Spiritual Benefits While the spiritual benefits of detoxification are usually less immediately noticeable, you might say they're the most rewarding. Imagine improved confidence and personal empowerment as you establish new routines and healthy habits. When your body is free of excessive toxins, you may benefit from increased longevity and quality of life as you reduce the impacts of premature aging, inflammation and chronic disease. Finally, you may find yourself more aware of your identity, centered in the present moment, and connected with your higher power.
