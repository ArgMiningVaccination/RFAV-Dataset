{"title": "2023 Mistletoe & Integrative Oncology Advanced Course", "author": null, "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": null, "sitename": null, "date": "2023-02-08", "cleaned_text": "The Advanced Course in Mistletoe Therapy & Integrative Oncology is designed for Medical Doctors (MD), Osteopathic Doctors (DO), Naturopathic Doctors from an accredited Naturopathic college (ND), Nurse Practitioners (NP) and Physician Assistants (PA). The course requires a prior training of at least 1000 hours of biomedical classes (including anatomy, physiology, pathology, diagnostics and therapy), as well as current state licensure to prescribe medicines. This new advanced course will review best practices and offer a deep dive into specific types of cancer and approaches to treatment. Begun in 2019, this mistletoe training is taught by some of the most experienced and knowledgeable allopathic and naturopathic clinicians in the field. After recently co-writing a book together, [Mistletoe and the Emerging Future of Integrative Oncology](https://www.themistletoebook.com/), our faculty is eager to share their decades of experience gained in the best European clinics, combining it with an overview of current integrative and naturopathic practices that are synergistic with mistletoe. Newcomers are welcome! Recordings of select introductory lectures will be provided as pre-requisite material to be reviewed prior to the in-person course. Newcomers are encouraged to register as early as possible in order to have sufficient time to review materials before February 8th. Practitioners who participate in this advanced course, or who have taken a previous mistletoe course offered through PAAM are eligible to apply to the Mistletoe Apprenticeship Program. Space for the in-person course is limited, so register early. Once all spots are filled, a waiting list will be created. The course will not be livestreamed or recorded. Priority will be given to licensed medical practitioners who are currently treating human patients. If you are a nurse interested in the training, you must apply to attend alongside the practitioner you work with. If you are a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine, please write to us at paamdrscourse@anthroposophy.org to inquire about availability of training in mistletoe therapy.
