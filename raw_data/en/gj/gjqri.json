These courses emphasize oral expression and comprehension, but also includes instruction in Chinese characters. Moreover, the courses integrate Chinese culture to promote students' cross-cultural awareness and understanding. Due to the great differences in Chinese and English, students will also be introduced strategies and skills for learning Chinese as a foreign language. Classes and field-based language activities are taught by experienced, professionally trained, native-speaking teachers of Chinese as a foreign language using oral proficiency-based methods. Students are placed into this level of the language courses based on in-country oral proficiency interviews. These placements may not directly correspond to the student's level at the home institution as SIT courses focus on communicative competence and linguistic functional ability. Instruction consists of 45 hours of formal classes spread over a six-week period. Various teaching methods are employed, including in-class discussions on Chinese and U.S. subjects, recitations for aural comprehension, and intensive grammar exercises. Students are placed in small groups for language instruction and exercises. TVM- and TCM-related vocabulary supplements daily lessons. Additional hours of guided practice in Chinese are provided during the educational excursion period. "}
