Consistent with the requirements of section 1886(d)(5)(K)(iii) of the Social Security Act, applicants submitted requests t o create a unique procedure code to describe the administration of a therapeutic agent, such as the option to create a new code in Section X within the ICD -10-PCS procedure code classification. In order to accommodate all of the requests received for the March 9 -10, 2021 ICD -10 Coordination and Mai ntenance Committee meeting, CMS initially only displayed the Agenda and related materials associated with the above NTAP - related ICD -10-PCS procedure code requests that involve the administration of a therapeutic agent .

New Technology Application? Yes. The requestor has submitted a New Technology Add -on Payment (NTAP) application for FY 2022 consideration. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Approval? No. Marketing authorization has not yet been granted for trilaciclib but is anticipated by the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date of February 15, 2021. Trilaciclib was granted Priority Review and Breakthrough Therapy Designation for th e mitigation of clinically significant chemotherapy - induced myelosuppression in adult patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Background: Myelosuppression is a condition in which bone marrow activity is decreased resulting in fewer erythrocytes, leuk ocytes, and thrombocytes. Myelosuppression is one of the most common treatment -related adverse events (AE) in patients receiving systemic chemotherapy. According to the requestor , trilaciclib is a myelopreservation therapy that has the potential to mitigat e chemotherapy induced myelosuppression (CIM) in SCLC patients receiving regimens containing platinum + etoposide +/ - checkpoint inhibitor; or a topotecan -containing regimen. Description of Trilaciclib Trilaciclib is a selective, transient inhibitor of cyclin dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) with chemoprotective activities. The CDK4/6 enzyme pathway is a key regulator of the cell cycle.1 Mechanism of Action According to the requestor , trilaciclib arrests hematopoietic stem and progenitor (HSPCs) bone marrow cells, in the G1 phase of the cell cycle during chemotherapy exposure, protecting them from chemotherapy -induced damage. Trilaciclib studies show it reduces CIM in patients with extensive -stage small -cell lung cancer (ES -SCLC).2 The requestor also noted that in patients with CDK4/6 -independent tumor cells, G1T28 may protect against multi -lineage CIM by transiently and reversibly inducing G1 cell cycle arrest in HSPCs and preventing transition to the S phase. This protects all hematopoietic linea ges, including red blood cells, platelets, neutrophils and lymphocytes, from the DNA -damaging effects of certain chemotherapeutics and preserves the function of the bone marrow and the immune system. Inpatient Administration of Trilaciclib Trilaciclib is given via intravenous (IV) administration 30 minutes before chemotherapy on the days chemotherapy is given to reduce the treatment associated side effects which include neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and the need for supportive care interventions and hospitalizations.3,4 The requestor stated trilaciclib should be administered at a dose of 240 mg/m2 1 Goel S, DeCristo MJ, McAllister SS, Zhao JJ.

Patients treated with trilaciclib are g enerally treated with 4 cycles of 21 days each, where days 1 -3 of the cycle involve chemotherapy with a dose of trilaciclib administered in conjunction with the chemotherapy. This is followed by an 18 -day treatment holiday. Dosing is based on body surface area, 240 mg/m2, with an average of 2 vials per patient. Vials are 300mg. Current Coding: There are no unique ICD -10-PCS codes to describe the administration of trilaciclib. Facilities can report the intravenous administration of trilaciclib using the fo llowing codes: 3E033GC Introduction of other therapeutic substance into the peripheral vein, percutaneous approach 3E043GC Introduction of other therapeutic substance into central vein, percutaneous approach Coding Options Option 1. Do not create new ICD-10-PCS codes for the intravenous administration of trilaciclib. Continue coding as listed in current coding. Option 2 . Create new codes in section X, New Technology, to identify the intravenous administration of trilaciclib. Section X New Technology Body System W Anatomical Regions Operation 0 Introduction: Putting in or on a therapeutic, diagnostic, nutritional, physiological, or prophylactic substance except blood or blood products Body Part Approach Device / Substance / Technology Qualifier 3 Peripheral Vein 4 Central Vein 3 Percutaneous ADD 7 Trilaciclib 7 New Technology Group 7 CMS Recommendation : Option 2, as described above. Interim Coding Advice: Continue using current codes as listed in current coding. 17 Administration of ZEPZELCA (lurbinectedin) Issue: Currently, there are no unique ICD -10-PCS codes to describe the administration of ZEPZELCA (lurbinectedin). New Technology Application? Yes. The requestor has submitted a New Technology Add -on Payment (NTAP) application for FY 2022 consideration. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Approval? Yes. The FDA approved the New Drug Application (NDA) for ZEPZELCA (lurbinectedin) on June 15, 2020, under the FDA's Accelerated Approval Program. Background: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the most aggressive form of lung cancer, characterized by rapid growth, early metastasis and rapid development of resistance to therapy. Most cases of SCLC occur in individuals a ged 60 -80 years. Risk factors for the development of SCLC can be patient -related or environment -related (e.g. asbestos exposure). The major patient - related risk factors include smoking, aged 65 years, and previous history of lung cancer. Approximately 60 -70% of patients with SCLC have clinically disseminated or extensive disease at diagnosis. Many patients with SCLC have substantial comorbidities that may affect performance status and treatment options. Although SCLC shows high sensitivity to first -line c hemotherapy and radiotherapy, most patients relapse or progress within one year of treatment. The majority of SCLC treated patients relapse, however few options exist for treatment of patients with SCLC after failure of first -line therapy. Without second -line chemotherapy, the median survival time is 2 to 4 months. There have been no approved treatments for second -line treatment of SCLC since 1998, when Hycamtin (topotecan) was approved. Given that most cases of SCLC occur in individuals aged 60-80 years, this is a challenging risk -benefit profile that warrants additional second -line treatment options. Description of ZEPZELCA (lurbinectedin) ZEPZELCA (lurbinectedin) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic SCLC with disease progre ssion on or after platinum -based chemotherapy. ZEPZELCA (lurbinectedin) is the first second -line treatment option for SCLC approved since 1998. According to the requestor, ZEPZELCA (lurbinectedin) provides an improvement for treatment of patients wit h metastatic SCLC with disease progression on or after platinum -based chemotherapy over safety results previously reported in the literature for a comparable patient population. Additionally, ZEPZELCA may represent a valuable clinical alternative to plat inum rechallenge.1,2 ZEPZELCA (lurbinectedin) safety data was reported by Trigo et al, 20203 as acceptable and manageable, where treatment -related SAEs occurred in 10.5% of patients; neutropenia and were most common (5%) each. Dose adm inistration was 1 Subbiah V, et al. Activity of lurbinectedin in second -line SCLC patie nts who are candidates for platinum rechallenge IASLC 2020 North American Conference on Lung Cancer.

Trigo et al, 2020 noted that, compared with topotecan (despite the use of primary G -CSF prophylaxis in topotecan studi es), ZEPZELCA (lurbinectedin) did not lead to any treatment related deaths (vs 7.9% to 11.2% for topotecan) had a lower rate of discontinuations due to treatment -related toxicity (2% vs 27%) lower grade 3/4 anemia (9% 26.1 a incidence febrile neutropenia (5% vs 3 to 22.7%, in SCLC population) Mechanism of Action ZEPZELCA (lurbinectedin), a transcription inhibitor and a synthetic marine -derived agent represents an innovative approach to conventional anti -cancer drugs, with a mechanism of action based on reducing transcription -dependent replication stress and genome instability in tumor cells.

ZEPZELCA is expected to be primarily administered in the outpatient setting. In some cases, treatment initiation with the first infusion and possibly some additional infusions will be administered in the inpatient hospital setting. Many patients with SCLC have substantial comorbidities that may necessitate their hospitalization and initiation of SCLC tr eatment while in the inpatient setting.

New Technology Application? Yes. The requestor has submitted a New Technology Add -on Payment (NTAP) application for FY 2022 consideration. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Approval? Yes. ENSPRYNG (satralizumab -mwge) received FDA approval for the treatment of Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD) in adult patients who are AQP4 -IgG positive on August 14, 2020. Background: Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD) is a rare, inflammatory, potentially life -threatening autoimmune central nervous system (CNS) disorder characterized prima rily by severe, unpredictable relapses of optic neuritis and/or acute longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM). The primary disease pathology is autoimmune astrocytopathy, and astrocytic damage is a common NMOSD CNS clinical finding. About 70% of NMOSD patients are seropositive for AQP4 -IgG, which is derived from peripheral plasma cells and binds to AQP4, the most abundant water channel membrane protein expressed in astrocytes and concentrated in spinal cord gray matter and the periaqueductal a nd periventricular regions. NMOSD prevalence is estimated at around 0.1 -10 per 100,000 individuals, affecting nearly 15,000 individuals in the United States. Individuals with NMOSD can experience recurring, successively more serious relapses. The vast majority of untreated patients (80% -90%) experience repeated relapses, and disability accumulates with each relapse. Around 60% of patients relapse within one year of diagnosis, and 90% relapse within three years. Compared with patients who experience an isolated attack, patients with relapsing disease have greater disease -related clinical burden, and upward of 83% of patients do not fully recover after subsequent relapses. According to the requestor, there are a limited number of treatment guidelines av ailable for NMOSD. The most recent US treatment guidelines were developed more than seven years ago, prior to any approved therapies for NMOSD. Therefore, US NMOSD treatment guidelines recommend exclusively off -label drugs such as azathioprine, with or wit hout mofetil, with receptor antagonist indicated for the treatment of N MOSD in adult patients who are anti -aquaporin -4 antibody -IgG) positive. ENSPRYNG (satralizumab -mwge) is the first subcutaneous, the first self - administered, and the third of only three FDA -approved drugs available for NMOSD. The two other FDA -approved therapies for patients with (eculizumab) (satralizumab -mwge) were evaluated in SAkuraStar 21 and distinct Phase 3, randomized, pla cebo -controlled, multicenter, double - blind studies with open -label extensions. In the SAkuraStar trial, the time to the first relapse was significantly longer in ENSPRYNG (satralizumab -mwge) -treated patients compared with patients who received a placebo. In addition, the time to the first relapse was significantly longer in patients treated with ENSPRYNG (satralizumab -mwge) plus immunosuppressive therapy (IST) compared with patients who received a placebo plus IST. In the double -blind period of the SAkuraSky trial, a lower proportion of patients in the ENSPRYNG (satralizumab -mwge) plus IST group had at least one adverse event compared to the placebo plus IST group (37 patients (90%) in the Enspryng plus IST group compared to 40 (95%) in the placebo pl us IST group). The most common adverse reactions (incidence at least 15%) were nasopharyngitis, headache, upper respiratory tract infection, gastritis, rash, arthralgia, extremity pain, fatigue, and nausea. Current Coding: There are no unique ICD -10-PCS codes to describe the administration of ENSPRYNG (satralizumab -mwge).

New Technology Application? Yes. The requestor has submitted a New Technology Add -on Payment (NTAP) application for FY 2022 consideration. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Approval? Cilta -cel was granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma in December 2019. The requestor will be seeking approval for a Biologics License Application (BLA). Background: Multiple myeloma is an inc urable blood cancer that affects a type of white blood cell called plasma cells. In 2020, it is estimated that more than 32,000 people were diagnosed and nearly 13,000 died from multiple myeloma in the US. Multiple myeloma is associated with substantial mo rbidity and mortality and approximately 25% of patients have a median survival of two years or less. Treatment of relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma constitutes a specific unmet medical need. Patients with relapsed and refractory disease are defined as those who, having achieved a minor response or better, relapse and then progress while on therapy, or experience progression within 60 days of their last therapy. Treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma is particularly challenging, as addi tional genetic mutations/alterations are continuously acquired, resulting in double -, triple -, or even multiple -refractoriness to many of the current multiple myeloma treatment options. CAR T -cell- based therapies offer potential advantages over current the rapeutic strategies. In general, the growing population of patients whose multiple myeloma is refractory to current treatments provides an opportunity for novel therapies. To date, there are no currently approved CAR T -cell therapies for the treatment of m directed against B-cell maturation antigen , BCMA, for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory mul tiple myeloma. BCMA plays a central role in regulating B -cell maturation and differentiation into plasma cells. Cilta -cel is designed to recognize myeloma cells and target their destruction. Its CAR T-cell technology consists of harvesting the patient's ow n T-cells, programming them to express a chimeric antigen receptor that identifies BCMA, a protein highly expressed on the surface of malignant multiple myeloma B -lineage cells, and reinfusing these modified cells back into the patient where they bind to t he myeloma cells displaying the BCMA antigen. The T -cells become activated and proliferate resulting in the release of pro -inflammatory cytokines and cytotoxic killing of malignant myeloma cells. Mechanism of Action Unlike the chimeric antigen receptor design of currently approved CAR T -cell immunotherapies, which are composed of a single -domain antibody (sdAbs), ciltacabtagene autoleucel ( cilta-cel) is composed of two antibody binding domains that allow for high recognition of human BCMA (CD269) and el imination of BCMA expressing myeloma cells. The two distinct BCMA -binding domains confer avidity and distinguish cilta -cel from other BC MA-targeting products. The BCMA - binding domains are linked to the receptor's interior costimulatory (4 -1BB) and signalin g through a transmembrane linker (CD8a). These intracellular domains are critical components for T cell growth and anti -tumor activity in the body once CAR T -cells are bound to the BCMA target on as a single intravenous infusion administered through the central or peripheral vein, primarily as a standalone procedure. Once infused into the patient, CAR T -cells are able to identify BCMA, a protein highly expressed on the surface of malignant multiple myeloma B -lineage cells and target their destruction. The target dose of cilta -cel is 0.75 x 106 CAR -positive viable T -cells per kg body weight (range: 0.5 -1.0 x 106 cells/kg ).

New Technology Application? Yes. The requestor has submitted a New Technology Add -on Payment (NTAP) application for FY 2022 consideration. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Approval? In March 2020, amivantamab was granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by FDA for the treatment of patients with met astatic non - small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 20 insertion mutations whose disease has progressed on or after platinum -based chemotherapy. The requestor submitted a Biologics License Application (BLA) for amivantamab on December 3, 2020. Background: Lung cancer is the second most common cancer in the U.S. Approximately 85 percent of all lung cancers are NSCLC. EGFR mutations are present in 10 to 15% of p atients with NSCLC and are categorized as either common EGFR mutations or atypical EGFR mutations. Exon 20 insertion mutations atypical EGFR mutations and comprise 4 -10% of NSCLC patients with an EGFR mutation. Treatment for patients with metastatic NSCLC has historically consisted of cytotoxic platinum - based chemotherapy. For patients with atypical EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations, there is no standard of care when disease has progressed on or after platinum -based chemotherapy. This form of disease has demonstrated resistance to oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors that target typical EGFR mutations. Description and Mechanism of Action for Amivantamab Amivantamab is a bispecific monoclonal antibody that is able to inhibit the epidermal growth factor rece ptor (EGFR) and c -mesenchymal epithelial transition (MET) tyrosine kinase signaling pathways known to be involved in the pathogenesis of NSCLC. It binds to the extracellular domains of the EGF and MET receptors. More specifically, research to date has ide ntified the following components of amivantamab's mechanism of action: Amivantamab prevents ligand binding to the EGFR and MET receptors, thereby simultaneously inhibiting EGFR and MET receptor signaling and preventing cellular proliferation. Amivantamab induces degradation of EGFR and MET receptors. Amivantamab engages natural killer cells and macrophages to eliminate tumor cells via antibody -dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) or trogocytosis Inpatient Administration of Amivantamab Amivantamab is t ypically administered in the outpatient setting, however there are unique circumstances in which it would be administered during an inpatient stay. When provided in the inpatient hospital setting, amivantamab is administered as an intravenous infusion thro ugh the central or peripheral vein. Amivantamab is administered on a 28 -day cycle. It is administered weekly for the first cycle, and every 2 weeks thereafter. It is continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. A vial of amivantamab contai ns 350mg of the drug. The dose is 1050 mg (3 vials) for patients who weigh less than 80 kg. The dose is 1400 mg (4 vials) for patients who weigh 25 80 kg or more. The very first dose is split between two infusions such that one vial is administered on day on e with the other vials administered on day two. Current Coding: There are no unique ICD -10-PCS codes to describe the administration of amivantamab. Facilities can report the intravenous administration of amivantamab using the following codes: 3E0330M Introduction of monoclonal antibody into peripheral vein, percutaneous approach 3E0430M Introduction of monoclonal antibody into central vein, percutaneous approach Coding Options Option 1.

New Technology Application? Yes. The requestor has submitted a New Technology Add -on Payment (NTAP) application for FY 2022 consideration. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Approval? Yes, FDA approval was received on November 24, 2020. The FDA also granted Breakthrough Device designation for the pr oduct. Background: Massive hemorrhage is a serious medical condition associated with high morbidity, seen in patients with trauma, complex surgical cases, gastrointestinal bleeding, postpartum hemorrhage, and other conditions. Hemostatic efficacy during massive hemorrhage requires a strong, stable clot that persists until the wound has healed. Fibrinogen, critical for forming the fibrin matrix at the site of hemorrhage, is one of the first clotting proteins to be severely depleted during massive bleeding. Due to its central role in clot formation, early replacement of fibrinogen and associated clotting proteins is a high -priority therapeutic goal in active hemorrhage management. According to the requestor , recent adoption of higher fibrinogen level targe ts for patient treatment and emphasis on early empiric or goal -directed fibrinogen replacement has put a spotlight on the current limitations of existing fibrinogen sources for treating patients today. The requestor noted that historically, cryoprecipitate antihemophilic factor (AHF) (\"cryoprecipitate\") has been used to treat massive hemorrhage; however, severely bleeding patients generally do not receive cryoprecipitate immediately on hospital admission in current massive transfusion protocols or during in -hospital surgical procedures because it is stored frozen and requires thawing before administration. A recent cohort study reported that for adult surgery patients receiving massive transfusion, the median time for cryoprecipitate to reach the patient in the hospital was 2.6 hours.1 Similarly, in a recent randomized trial in adult cardiac surgery patients, the delay from recognition of major bleeding to cryoprecipitate administration was 1.7 hours.2 If unused within four to six hours of thawing, cryopreci pitate must be discarded due to concern for bacterial contamination, leading to hospital wastage. The requestor stated that the high wastage rates due to limited post -thaw storage has limited cryoprecipitate availability at many hospitals and thus impeded use of cryoprecipitate as an effective fibrinogen source in the rapid, early treatment of massive hemorrhage. Description and Mechanism of Action for PRCFC PRCFC is a highly -processed, pathogen reduced product optimized to provide a concentrated source of fibrinogen to treat fibrinogen deficiency -related bleeding, including massive hemorrhage. In addition to fibrinogen, PRCFC also contains other clotting factors including factor XIII and von Willebrand factor (vWF) which are necessary to achieve stable clo t formation and restore hemostasis. PRCFC is produced from plasma treated by the INTERCEPT\u00ae Blood System which uses amotosalen and UVA light to inactivate pathogens.

JAMA, 322 (20), 1 -11. 27 INTERCEPT\u00ae Blood System process enables a broad spectrum transfusion -transmitted infe ction (TTI) risk reduction, including viruses, bacteria, and other pathogens. Due to pathogen inactivation, PRCFC has a 5 -day post -thaw shelf life, while traditional cryoprecipitate has only a 4 to 6 hour shelf life. PRCFC can be stored thawed in the oper ating room or emergency department for immediate use. Inpatient Administration of PRCFC PRCFC is administered via intravenous infusion. The proposed number of PRCFC units to create the desired dose is determined by the clinician. No ABO or other pre -admin istration testing is required before using PRCFC. Current Coding: There are no unique ICD -10-PCS codes to describe the transfusion of Pathogen Reduced Cryoprecipitated Fibrinogen Complex (PRCFC). Facilities can report the transfusion of PRCFC using one of the following codes: 30233T1 Transfusion of nonautologous fibrinogen into peripheral vein, percutaneous 30243T1 Transfusion of nonautologous fibrinogen into central vein, percutaneous approach With one of the following codes: 30233M1 Transfusion of nonautologous plasma cryoprecipitate into peripheral vein, percutaneous approach 30243M1 Transfusion of nonautologous plasma cryoprecipitate into central vein, percutaneous approach Reporting one code to identify the transfusion of fibrinog en in combination with one code to identify the transfusion of plasma cryoprecipitate allows the better capture of the two main components of this blood product (PRCFC), in the absence of a unique code.

New Technology Application? No. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) Approval? No. Submission of OTL -103 to the FDA is expected to begin in the 4th quarter of 2021. Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation was granted on July 29, 2019 and Rare Pediatric Disease designation on August 18, 2019. Background: Wiskott Aldrich Syndrome (WAS) is a rare, X -linked primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by mutations in the WAS gene encoding the W AS protein (WASP), responsible for maintaining cellular architecture integral to intracellular and cell -substrate interactions and signaling. WAS is a spectrum disorder that may progress over time and is characterized by microthrombocytopenia, eczema, rec urrent or severe life -threatening infections, and malignancy or autoimmunity. The burden of illness is profound; patients may require frequent treatment with anti -infectives and/or immunoglobulin, or platelet transfusions as well as protective head gear t o prevent injuries. They may also have impaired sleep or excessive scratching due to eczema. Clinical management of WAS is based on supportive care for infections, manifestations of autoimmunity, and microthrombocytopenia. The approximate survival of WAS patients is 15 years with supportive treatment. Allogeneic h ematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is a definitive treatment that is considered for eligible WAS patients. Allogeneic HSCT -limiting complications are common, affecting up to half of all p atients, and include side effects of conditioning regimens, graft -vs-host disease (GVHD), graft rejection, and autoimmune complications. The success and accompanying morbidity are largely based upon the degree of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) -matching between the donor and the patient. While overall survival associated with HLA -matched donors is high at approximately 90%, significant morbidity and mortality limits its use, particularly in patients over the age of 5 years. However, HLA -matched donors are o nly available for a minority of patients, meaning alternative donor sources such as mismatched donors, haploidentical donors, or umbilical cord blood must be used, which increase the risk of morbidity and are associated with lower survival rates of approxi mately 50%. According to the requestor, Orchard Therapeutics has an ex vivo autologous HSC -GT approach designed to modify a patient's own HSPCs using a lentiviral vector. This gene therapy approach relies on the intrinsic ability of HSPCs to self -renew in a patient's bone marrow and produce new stem cell progeny. By doing so, patients are able to avoid the need for an allogeneic HSCT, reducing the morbidity (such as GVHD ) and mortality associated with transplant, as well as eliminat ing the need for a don or search. Description of OTL -103 OTL -103 is an (HSPC) transduced ex vivo using a lentiviral vector encoding the human WAS gene for the treatment of patients d iagnosed with WAS. OTL -103 is a durable treatment that can provide comprehensive immune reconstitution across stem cell progeny in this phenotypically 30 heterogenous population of patients characterized by autoimmunity. As an ex vivo autologous hematopoieti c stem cell gene therapy (HSC -GT) approach, OTL -103 has not exhibited the significant mortality and morbidity known to be associated with allogeneic HSCT therapy, such as GVHD. If approved by the FDA, OTL -103 would be the first ex vivo autologous HSC -GT available for use in the US intended for the treatment of patients diagnosed with WAS. Mechanism of Action OTL -103 is an investigational autologous HSPC -enriched cell fraction that contains CD34+ HSPCs genetically modified ex vivo using a lentiviral vector encoding the WAS complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) sequence with expression driven by the endogen ous WAS promoter, leading to physiological expression in stem cell progeny. OTL -103 was evaluated in clinical trials and expanded access programs. As of January 2020, 23 patients have been treated with OTL -103. According to the requestor, t here were no re ported adverse events related to OTL - 103. In patients that did experience mild or moderate adverse events, investigator assessment concluded they were related to the conditioning regimen. Inpatient Administration of OTL -103 The gene therapy approach for administration of OTL -103 includes five steps: 1. Autologous HSPCs are harvested from the patient through leukapheresis or bone marrow harvest. 2. The harvested sample is selected and purified to a CD34+ enriched cell fraction. 3. In an ex vivo process, a lentiviral vector is utilized to insert a working copy of the missing or faulty gene into the cells (the gene is disease -specific) and the product is cryopreserved, ensuring that the drug product can be released following quality control testing. 4. The pa tient undergoes a conditioning regimen (selected regimen is disease - dependent). 5. The genetically corrected HSPCs are transported to the treatment site, thawed, and then infused into the patient intravenously as a single, durable treatment . These cells e ngraft in the patient's bone marrow and begin to self -renew to produce healthy stem cell progeny containing the functional gene. The administration details of OTL -103, including information regarding conditioning, will be described in the final prescribi ng information.

New Technology Application? No. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) Approval? No. Submission of OTL -200 to the FDA is expected to begin in the 4th quarter of 2021. Rare Pediatric Disease designation was granted on May 3, 2018. Background: Metach romatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is a rare and life -threatening inherited disease of the body's metabolic system occurring in approximately one in every 100,000 live births, characterized by severe motor and cognitive impairment. MLD is caused by a mutation i n the arylsulfatase A ( ARSA ) gene that results in massive accumulation of sulfatides in the brain, peripheral nervous system, causing progressive neurodegeneration of the central and peripheral nervous systems. Over time, the nervous system is damaged, lea ding to neurological problems such as motor, behavioral and cognitive regression, severe spasticity, and seizures. Patients with MLD gradually lose the ability to move, talk, swallow, eat, and see. MLD is classified by the age at which symptoms first de velop into early onset disease (<7 years old) or late r onset disease (7 years of age or older). In the United States, the diagnostic pathway for MLD is heterogenous due to variable age onset and symptomatology , and may involve protracted workups with pote ntial severe symptom onset prior to official diagnosis. Late infantile MLD has consistent and uniform initial presenting symptoms such as peripheral neuropathy, muscle weakness, hypotonia, and hypo - or areflexia that then advance to progressive loss of all motor functions, inability to swallow, mental regression, visual and auditory impairment, and even seizures. Disease in juvenile and adult MLD subtypes can be variable in presentation and symptomology; in juvenile MLD, symptoms include primary neurologic symptoms such as gait disturbance, loss of fine motor skills, changes in behavior, or attention difficulties, while adult MLD symptoms include primarily psychiatric symptoms such as emotional lability, personality changes, or psychotic episodes. Currently , there are no approved treatments for MLD in the US . According to the requestor, while multiple therapies have been attempted and/or theorized, the development of treatments for MLD is limited by the inability of therapeutics to cross the blood -brain bar rier, where therapy would be needed for effect, and the necessity for the timing of therapy prior to the rapidly progressive phase of the disease to prevent irreversible damage downstream from the lysosomal storage dysfunction. Because of this, most treatm ent efforts are restricted to palliative or supportive measures to address current symptoms and prevent or delay secondary complications. According to the requestor, in late infantile MLD, the only treatment option is palliative care. In juvenile -onset MLD, allogeneic hematopoietic stem -cell transplant (HSCT) is a treatment approach with limited efficacy. When administered prior to symptom onset, allogeneic HSCT can provide stabilization of the cerebral demyelination process and potentially slow disease progression in later onset forms of MLD. However, allogeneic HSCT is ineffective in delaying peripheral nervous system progression, so patients post -HSCT may still experience severe, peripheral neuropathy -related motor deficits. Additionally, allogeneic HSCT is restricted by the 33 availability of a human -leukocyte antigen (HLA) -matched donor and the risk of morbidity and mortality. According to the requestor, Orchard Therapeutics has an ex vivo autologous HSC -GT approach designed to modify a patient's own HSPCs using a lentiviral vector. This gene therapy approach relies on the intrinsic ability of HSPCs to self -renew in a patient's bone marrow and produce new stem cell progeny. By doing so, allogeneic HSCT -eligible patients are able to avoid the need for an HSCT, reducing the morbidity (such as graft -versus -host disease ) and mortality associated with transplant, as well as eliminate the need for a donor search , and non -eligible patients are presented with a viable treatment option beyond palliative or supportive care . Description transduced ex vivo using a lentiviral v ector encoding the ARSA gene for the treatment of patients diagnosed with metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD). OTL -200 can be given in early symptomatic MLD, depending on the MLD subtype. If approved by the FDA, OTL -200 would be the first ex vivo autologous hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy (HSC -GT) available for use in the US intended for the treatment of patients diagnosed with MLD. Mechanism of Action OTL -200 is an investigational autologous HSPC -enriched cell fraction that contains CD34+ HSPCs genetically modified ex vivo using a lentiviral vector encoding the ARSA complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) sequence with constitutive expression driven by the human phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoter leading to expression of ARSA in all stem cell progeny (Sessa 2016). As an ex vivo autologous HSC -GT approach, OTL -200 is a durable treatment that does not require the donor matching needed for allogeneic HSCT and can provide comprehensive benefit, including in infantile -onset disease . OTL -200 cells, which are able to cross the blood -brain barrier, are reinfused into patients following a conditioning regimen, which reduces defective cells and favors the engraftment of genetically modified cells expressing ARSA. OTL -200 has been evaluated in prospective, non -randomized phase I/II clinical trials and expanded access programs. A phase III open label trial is currently recruiting. As of May 2020, 39 patients have been treated with OTL -200. According to the requestor , no serious adverse events or mortality related to OTL -200 have been reported to date. The most commonly reported adverse events were potentially related to busulfan conditioning and included febrile neutropenia, infections, liver disorders, stomatitis, a nd mucosal inflammation. During clinical development, anti-ARSA antibodies (AAA) were reported in 5 patients (antibodies against ARSA), which resolved spontaneously or after treatment with rituximab. Inpatient Administration of OTL -200 The gene therapy ap proach for administration of OTL -200 includes five steps: 1. Autologous HSPCs are harvested from the patient through leukapheresis or bone marrow harvest. 2. The harvested sample is selected and purified to a CD34+ enriched cell fraction. 3. In an ex vivo process, a lentiviral vector is utilized to insert a working copy of the missing or faulty gene into the cells (the gene is disease -specific) and the product is cryopreserved, ensuring that the drug product can be released following quality -34 control testing . The genetically corrected HSPCs are transported to the treatment site. 4. The patient undergoes a conditioning regimen (selected regimen is disease - dependent). 5. The genetically corrected HSPCs are, thawed and then infused into the patient intravenously as a single, durable treatment . These cells engraft in the patient's bone marrow and begin to self -renew to produce healthy stem cell progeny containing the functional gene. The administration details of OTL -200, including information regarding conditioning, will be described in the final prescribing information.

New Technology Application? Yes. The requestor has submitted a New Technology Add -on Payment (NTAP) application for FY 2022 consideration. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) Approval? No. Vericel is seeking FDA approval of a BLA for NexoBrid. Vericel is expecting FDA approval for NexoBrid on June 29, 2021 with an indication of eschar removal (debridement) in adults with deep partial thickness (DPT) and/or full thickness (FT) thermal burns. Background: In burn patients, timely and rapid eschar removal is essential to initiate the wound healing process and prevent further complications. The dead tissue, if not removed, often becomes heavily contaminated in 2 to 3 days. The dead tissue can be the source of local and/or systemic infection, which can destroy healthy surrounding tissues and extend the original damage. To prevent these complications, it is imperative to remove escha r and evaluate the burn at the earliest possible oppo rtunity. Once the eschar is removed, the wound bed can be revealed to observe and assess the true damage, and then the appro priate wound closure modality can be determined . Removal of eschar may be acc omplished by surgical or non -surgical means. The current standard of care (SOC) in the US relies primarily on surgical excision through use of sharp instruments such as scalpels and dermatomes to cut away/remove devitalized tissue. Non -excisional surgical procedures for the removal include Versajet br agents such as silver sulfadiazine (SSD), and various hydrogels. The cho ice of eschar removal method depends on many variables such as burn depth, anatomical site and size (expressed as percentage of Total Body Surface Area (TBSA) ) of the burn wound , the patient's general condition, available donor site for autograft harvestin g, as well as the availability of surgical facilities (operating rooms) and staff. Technology NexoBrid is a botanical and biologic product for topic al use and is comprised of two components: the NexoBrid powder that contains the active pharmaceutical in gredient (API) and a gel vehicle. The NexoBrid API is a concentrate of proteolytic enzymes enriched in Bromelain extracted from pineapple stems. According to the requestor, NexoBrid is the first enzymatic eschar removal technology to achieve rapid, consis tent eschar removal. The novel mechanism of action of NexoBrid's active pharmaceutical ingredient is mediated by the proteolytic activity of the mixture of enzymes that selectively removes eschar and denatured collagen while sparing healthy tissue. NexoBri d has been shown in two phase 3 clinical trials (\"DETECT\" NCT02148705, NCT00324311) to have a statistically lower rate of surgical excision and lower rate of blood loss than the current SOC and an average time to complete eschar removal of 1.0 days as comp ared with an average to complete eschar removal of 3.8 days for the current SOC. 36 NexoBrid has been developed for patients with deep partial thickness and/or full thickness thermal burns . According to the requestor, NexoBrid use is not dependent on oper ating room facilities since it can be applied at the patient's bedside, which also eliminates the need for general anesthesia and the additional medical personnel required for surgical procedures. The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) identified NexoBrid as a critical medical countermeasure to address the public health emergency need for an eschar removal product for the treatment of burns in adults, especially for mass casualty events, where surgical capacity is limited and ra pid assessment of burn severity and intervention are imperative. Procedure Description Prior to use, NexoBrid powder and the gel vehicle are mixed to obtain NexoBrid Gel for topical use in a final concentration of 0.09 g/g concentrate of proteolytic enzymes enriched in b romelain. Mixed NexoBrid Gel is applied for 4 hours to the burn wound at a dose of 2 g NexoBrid powder mixed with 20 g gel vehicle per 1% TBSA, or 5 g NexoBrid powder mixed with 50 g gel vehicle per 2.5% TBSA. NexoBrid can be applied t o an area of up to 15% TBSA in one session. Current Coding: There are no unique ICD -10-PCS codes to describe the application of b romelain - enriched proteolytic enzyme for non -excisional eschar removal. can report the application of bromelain -enriched proteolytic enzyme using the following code: 3E00XGC Introduction of other therapeutic substance into skin and mucous membranes, external approach Coding Options Option 1.

Interim Coding Advice: Continue using current codes as listed in current coding. 37 Application of Bioengineered Allogeneic Construct Issue: There are currently no unique ICD -10-PCS codes to describe the application of a bioengineered allogeneic construct. New Technology Application? Yes. The requestor has submitted a New Technology Add -on Payment (NTAP) application for FY 2022 consideration. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) Approval? No. Stratatech Corporation, a Mallinckrodt company, is seeking FDA approval for the treatment of adult s with thermal burns containing intact dermal elements for which surgical intervention is clinically indicated . FDA approval is anticipated by June 30 , 2021. Background: Annually, in the United States, approximately 500,000 burn injuries receive emergency medical treat ment, leading to 40,000 burn injury hospitalizations with 30,000 at hospital burn centers. Vulnerable patient populations are at an increased risk of death due to the skin loss and its complications. For patients 65 years old or older, burn injury was re ported as the eighth leading cause of death. Today, 96.7% of burn patients treated in burn centers will survive. According to the requestor , many of those survivors will sustain serious scarring and lifelong physical disabilities that can have a considera bly negative effect on the patient's health - related quality of life, affecting physical and emotional participation, anxiety, depression, pain, heat sensitivity, and ability to return to work. Autograft ing is considered to be a standard of care for seve re thermal burns. Among burn patients who were hospitalized, approximately a quarter of them received autografts. An autograft procedure involves the surgical harvesting of healthy skin tissue from an uninjured site on the patient and transplanting the sk in graft to the injury. While this process can be effective in providing closure of the original wound, it has significant limitations related to the donor site wounds created during surgical removal of the skin tissue for grafting. Donor site wounds are painful and can create risks of additional scarring and infection. After patients undergo autografting, in the long term, both the grafted wound site and the donor site require continuous physical and rehabilitative therapy to maintain the range of movem ent, minimize scar and contracture development, and maximize functional ability. Furthermore, the amount of healthy skin available for harvesting is frequently limited in patients with burns involving 50 -60% total body surface area, necessitating sequenti al re-harvesting of available donor sites. In addition, autografting is especially undesirable in vulnerable patient populations, such as the elderly. Geriatric skin has a thinner dermis, significant alterations in its structure due to changes in collage n production and turnover, slower angiogenesis and revascularization leading to delayed wound healing, and an increased risk of excessive scarring. Technology StrataGraft is an investigational, viable, bioengineered, allogeneic construct consisting of an epidermal layer of viable, fully stratified, allogeneic human Near -diploid Immortalized Keratinocytes (NIKS\u00ae) cells growing on a dermal layer composed of viable normal human dermal fibroblasts embedded in a collagen -rich matrix. According to the requestor , StrataGraft mimics the normal function of native skin, promotes the autologous healing of severe burn wounds without the 38 requirement to harvest healthy skin, and may be applied universally to patients (i.e., it is not a patient -specific product). StrataGraft leverages the regenerative capacity of the patient's skin while minimizing or eliminating the complications associated with autograft harvest. In addition to providing immediate wound coverage and epidermal barrier function, the viable cells w ithin StrataGraft express and secrete a wide variety of peptides, growth factors, and cytokines that are known to promote healing, potentially reducing the need for autograft in the management of severe thermal burns. According to the requestor, StrataGr aft is the only product granted regenerative medicine advanced therapy (RMAT) designation for the treatment of patients with acute severe thermal burns, as described in section 3033 of the 21st Century Cures Act. Upon FDA approval, StrataGraft will be the only cellular and/or tissue product for treatment of thermal burns that promotes durable wound closure and regenerative healing. Current Coding: There are no unique ICD -10-PCS codes to describe skin replacement using a bioengineered allogeneic construct.

New Technology Application? Yes. The requesto r has submitted a New Technology Add -on Payment (NTAP) application for FY 2022 consideration. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) Approval? Yes. On June 26, 2020, the FDA granted 510(k) Clearance [K200760]. Background: Approximately 800,000 primary (first -time) or secondary (recurrent) strokes occur each year in the U.S., with the majority being primary strokes (roughly 600,000). Of these strokes, approximately 87% are ischemic infarctions, subarachnoid hemorr hage. The most disabling strokes are those due to large vessel occlusions (LVOs), and treatment of these strokes has the largest therapeutic benefits. The ASPECTS score is an assessment of the CT scan in a stroke patient to determine if there is evidence of irreversible injury in ten different brain regions. The Alberta Stroke Program Early CT score (ASPECTS) requ ires the evaluation of ten pre-defined MCA vascular territories and is calculated by subtracting one point for each involved region. Scores les s than 6 typically signify patients with an irreversible large hemispheric infarction. Typically, a patient presenting to a hospital with signs or symptoms of a suspected stroke would move through the healthcare system as follows: 1) Patients arrive at an emergency department and are rapidly triaged to the CT scanner for a non-contrast CT (NCCT) and CT Angiography (CTA). The CTA directly images large vessel occlusions and the NCCT can exclude brain hemorrhage and identify early signs of brain infarction 2) If a large vessel occlusion (LVO) is identified, a physician, typically a radiologist or neuroradiologist, determines the ASPECT score by taking a closer look for evidence of early infarct signs on the NCCT. 3) Patients within six hours of symptoms onset, wit h an ASPECT score between 6 and 10 that meets the clinical criteria for mechanical thrombectomy should receive thrombectomy as soon as possible. Patients who present beyond six hours of symptoms onset require a CT perfusion or MRI scan to identify if they are eligible for mechanical thrombectomy. The requestor notes that ASPECT score determination can be difficult because early infarct signs are often very subtle and challenging to interpret correctly. Often there is disagreement between experts on the ex act score and sometimes these disagreements preclude a definite answer regarding if the patient qualifies for thrombectomy or not. These interpretation challenges are manifested by limited inter -rater agreement, even among experts. 41 Technology According to the requestor, Rapid ASPECTS is a unique machine learning -based, fully automated software for assessment of ASPECTS to assist frontline clinicians and radiologists to interpret CT scans and provide triage and appropriate care of stroke patients. Rapid A SPECTS extracts image data for the ROI(s) to provide analysis and computer analytics based on morphological characteristics and produces a score for each of the ten ASPECTS regions, as well as a total score in approximately two minutes. The Rapid ASPECTS processing (which takes an average of about two minutes) occurs during the time when the CTA is being performed; therefore, it is immediately available following completion of the NCCT/CTA scan. According to the requestor, Rapid ASPECTS has several potent ial benefits over the current standard of care: 1. Improved accuracy of ASPECT scoring: Two studies1,2 have shown that the automated Rapid ASPECTS score is significantly more accurate than the scores obtained by experienced clinicians. 2. Improved treatment deci sions: Retrospective studies have shown the treatment decisions made by experienced clinicians would have been improved with the use of Rapid ASPECTS12,3. 3. Reduced inter -rater variability: The analysis of the study that led to the FDA clearance of Rapid ASPECTS demonstrated a statistically significant reduction is inter -rater variability4. 4. Improved time to treatment: As radiologists are not immediately available at the time when many LVO patients present, and obtaining a read from a neuroradiologist often takes even longer, the time to determine an ASPECT score is expected to be improved with t he software. This is expected to lead to faster treatment times, which have been shown to reduce disability. Current Coding: The interpretation of imaging procedures and characterization of Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) Regions of Inter est utilizing software is not reported separately for inpatient hospital coding. Facilities can report the CT and CT angiogram using the appropriate codes in section B, Imaging. Coding Options Option 1.

New Technology Application? No, not at this time. The requestor intends to submit a New Technology Add -on Payment (NTAP) application for FY 2024 consideration. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) Approval? No. The Carmat total artificial heart (TAH) is currently in an FDA approved clinical study (IDE G180184, NCT 04117295). Background: Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death in the developed world (WHO Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) Fact sheet N\u00b0317). The prevalence of Heart Failure (HF) in Europe and the United States is approximately 12 million, of which 0.5 -5% in advanced HF refractory to medical management1,2,3. Cardiac transplantation remains the primary option for just a select group of end -stage HF patients because of donor organ shortage. The number of heart transplant procedures reported to the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation registry has plateaued since 2007 between 4000 and 4200 procedures per year4. In parallel , the numbers of patients living with compromised cardiac function and HF is expected to rise over the next few decades because of the aging population3. The shortage of heart donors has fueled the development of Left Ventricular Assist Devices (LVADs) to assist the failing left ventricle, on a temporary or permanent basisError! Bookmark not defined. 5,6,7. The adoption of LVADs as a viable therapy for end -stage heart failure has resulted in increased referrals of patients on both sides of the spectrum, from New York Heart Association (NYH A) class 3+ to those in need of total cardiac replacement therapy6,7,8,9,10 1 Roger VL, Go AS, Lloyd -Jones DM, Adams RJ, Berry JD, Brown TM, Carnethon MR, Dai S, de Simone G, Ford ES, Fox CS, Fullerton HJ, Gillespie C, Greenlund KJ, Hailpern DT, Lichtman JH et al..

Moreover, the use of LVADs has revealed clinical events that are related to mono - ventricular support, such as right heart failure, renal failure11. First generation of TAHs and biventricular VADs are pneumatically -driven and have been used as a bridge to transplantation, at the cost of high morbidities related to the devices (infection, bleeding, stroke) and limited mobility for the patient12,13,14,15 Technology There are currently two totally artificial heart systems: Sy nCardia (SynCardia Systems, LLC, Tucson, SA, V\u00e9lizy, France). 16 The SynCardia temporary TAH was FDA approved (P030011) in 2004. The SynCardia TAH is pneumatically driven pulsatile system and is indicated for use as a bridge to transplantation in cardiac transplant -eligible candidates at risk of imminent death from biventricular failure. The Carmat TAH is an integrated auto regula ted and electro hydraulically driven biocompatible, pulsatile, system intended for full cardiac support The following table highlights the differences between the two TAH systems: Feature Syncardia TAH CARMAT TAH Mode of actu ation External pneumatic drivers Internal electro hydraulic pumps Blood contact Synthetic surfaces Bioprosthetic surfaces Valves 4 mechanical valves 4 biological valves Blood flow regulation Limited and manual Autoregulated by the device According to the requestor, the Carmat TAH system is comprised of 3 components: 1.

It weighs <5kg and includes a controller and lithium -ion batteries providing an autonomy of about 4 hours 3. The hospital care console : The medical team must use the hospital care console (HCC) to operate the prosthesis during implantation and track how the device is functioning Procedure Description The Carmat TAH is implanted in the orthotopic position during standard open -heart procedure using cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The native ventricles are excised up to the left and right atrioventricular junctions. Bioprosthetic flanges with a circular central opening reinforced by a silicon ring are cut and sutured onto the mitral and tricuspid valve orifices. The flanges are connect ed to a single titanium interface device with two central openings. The Carmat TAH, with the inflow valves in place, is then positioned and secured with a click onto the interface device. Next, the pulmonary conduit with outflow valve is sutured to the dis tal pulmonary artery. Finally, the aortic conduit containing the outflow valve is sutured to the distal aorta. The percutaneous driveline from the device is tunneled to exit the skin at the lower right abdominal quadrant. The driveline is then connected to the controller and hospital care console. De -airing and weaning of CPB is accomplished by decreasing CPB flow while increasing the Carmat TAH output. When the device has achieved full flow, the operation mode is switched from manual to auto -regulation. Current Coding: There are no unique ICD -10-PCS codes to identify implantation of an autoregulated electrohydraulic total artificial heart.

New Technology Application? Yes. The requestor has submitted a New Technology Add -on Payment (NTAP) application for FY 2022 consideration. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) Approval? Yes. The Aidoc Briefcase for pulmonary embolism was cleared by the FDA under the 510(k) pathway on April 15, 2019. Background: In the United States it is estimated that as many as 900,000 people are affected by a venous thromboembolism (VTE), such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), each year1 with V TE being the third most common cause of cardiovascular death following only myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular accidents (or stroke).2 Across all VTEs, mortality is high with 10 to 30% of individuals dying within 30 days of diagnosis.3 However, acute, symptomatic PE is especially life threatening as death occurs within 1 hour of onset in up to 10% of cases.4 Options exist for treating acute, symptomatic PE, and range from anticoagulation therapy to catheter -directed thrombolysis and thrombectomy5,6,7 and clinical studies have demonstrated a strong correlation between time to communication of PE findings, treatment and clinical outcomes.8,9,10 The requestor also notes that typically, patients with pulmonary embolism (PE) or suspected PE present at hospital emergency departments . Those patients that present to a hospital with signs or symptoms of PE generally move through the system as follows: (1) Patient presents with suspected PE to the ED (2) Patient receives CT Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) ima ging (3) Technologist processes and reconstructs the CT images and manually routes them to the hospital PACS. (4) The exam enters a FIFO (first -in-first-out) reading queue, where it awaits radiological 1 https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/dvt/data.html 2 Tarbox AK, Swaroop M.

The device is intended to assist hospital networks and trained radiologists in workflow triage by flagging and communication of suspected positive findings in CT pulmonary angiograms. The requestor states that presenting the radiologist with this notification facilitates earlier tr iage by prompting the user to assess the relevant original images in the picture archiving and communication system (PACS). , The requestor reports that as a result, the suspect case receives attention earlier than would have been the case in the standard o f care practice alone . The software system is based on an algorithm programmed component and is comprised of a standard off -the-shelf operating system, the Microsoft Windows server 2012 64bit, and additional applications, which include PostgreSQL, DICOM module and the BriefCase Image Processing Application. The device consists of the following three modules: (1) Aidoc Hospital Server (AHS); (2) Aidoc Cloud Server (ACS); and (3) Aidoc Worklist Application that is installed on the radiologist' s desktop and provides the user interface in which notifications from the BriefCase software are received.

New Technology Application? Yes. The requestor has submitted a New Technology Add -on Payment (NTAP) application for FY 2022 consideration. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) Approval? Yes. Caption Guidance received breakthrough designation from the FDA i n 2018 for the acquisition of cardiac ultrasound images using an AI -guided system. The FDA authorized Caption Guidance under the De Novo classification on February 7, 2020, and cleared an updated version of Caption Guidance on April 16, 2020. Background: An echocardiogram, also called echocardiography or diagnostic cardiac ultrasound, is a non -invasive, imaging modality for quantitative and qualitative evaluation of cardiac anatomy and function. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is the most common nonin vasive type of echocardiogram, and is often used as a first -line cardiac imaging modality, owing to its wide availability, noninvasiveness, and lack of radiation exposure. During a TTE, a technician places a hand -held probe called a transducer on the pati ent's chest. The transducer sends high frequency sound waves that bounce off the heart and \"echo\" back to the probe to create pictures of the heart's chambers, valves, walls and the blood vessels (aorta, arteries, veins) attached to the heart. Two -dimensio nal TTE (2D -TTE) provides tomographic or \"thin slice\" imaging, with the transducer position (parasternal, apical, subcostal, suprasternal) and view (long axis, short axis, four -chamber, five -chamber). Almost all imaging is performed with the patient in the left lateral decubitus position during quiet respiration or extended expiration. Technology According to the requestor, Caption Guidance is the only FDA -cleared AI -guided medical imaging acquisition system intended to as sist medical professionals in the acquisition of cardiac ultrasound images. The Caption Guidance software functions using a deep learning algorithm, namely convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that were trained using echocardiographic clips from studies p erformed by trained sonographers. It gives real -time guidance to the healthcare practitioners during the acquisition of echocardiography to assist in obtaining anatomically correct images that represent standard 2D echocardiographic diagnostic views and or ientations. The Caption Guidance system is software as a medical device (SaMD). To use the software, the Caption Guidance system must be installed on a compatible third -party ultrasound system. The Caption Guidance system is indicated for use in 2D -TTE fo r adult patients, specifically in the acquisition of the following standard views: Parasternal Long -Axis Guidance The Caption Guidance system contains the following features, which act in tandem to guide the user to acquire diagnostic quality echocardiographic images: Quality Meter - Real-time feedback from the Quality Meter advises the user on the expected diagnostic quality of the resulting clip, such that the user can make decisions about further optimizing the quality using the prescriptive guidance feature below. Prescriptive Guidance - The Prescriptive Guidance feature in Caption Guid ance provides direction to the user to emulate how a sonographer would manipulate the transducer to acquire the optimal view. Auto -Capture - The Auto -Capture feature in Caption Guidance triggers an automatic capture of a clip when the quality is pred icted to be diagnostic, emulating the way in which a sonographer knows when an image is of sufficient quality to be diagnostic and records it. Save Best Clip - This feature continually assesses clip quality while the user is scanning and, in the even t that the user is not able to obtain a clip sufficient for auto - capture, the software allows the user to retrospectively record the highest quality clip obtained so far, mimicking the choice a sonographer might make when recording an exam. Current Coding : Facilities can report transthoracic echocardiography using the appropriate code(s) in section B, Imaging. The utilization of software to guide TTE image acquisition is not reported separately for inpatient hospital coding. Coding Options Option 1. Do not create new ICD -10-PCS codes for transthoracic echocardiography with AI - guided image acquisition . Continue coding as listed in current coding. Option 2 .

Interim Coding Advice: Continue using current codes as listed in current coding. 57 Tissue Oxygen Saturation Imaging of GI Tract Issue: There are currently no unique ICD -10-PCS codes to describe endoscopic tissue oxygen saturation imaging of the GI tract . New Technology Application? Yes. The requestor has submitted a New Technology Add -on Payment (NTAP) application for FY 2022 considera Drug Administration (FDA) Approval? The EP -7000X System received Breakthrough D evice designation from the FDA on September 17, 2020. The 510(k) submission for the EP -7000X System was submitted on December 18, 2020 and clearance is expected between April and June 2021. Background: Minimally invasive endoscopic procedures are typically performed through one or more small incisions, using a small video camera and surgical instruments. Physicians perform these surgical procedures using the inst ruments inserted in the body cavity through the incision(s) while observing images of the surgical site provided by the camera. In general, minimally invasive surgery is associated with less pain, a shorter hospital stay and fewer complications. Existing endoscopic imaging systems provide physicians with full -color video images on a monitor similar to what they would see with their naked eye during open surgeries . According to the requestor, i n addition to providing the full -color image, the EP -7000X Syst em allows for the visualization of tissue oxygen saturation (StO 2) levels of the GI tract using a 2D endoscopic image during surgeries . The requestor states that n o other endoscopic imaging system currently on the market has this capability. Technology The EP-7000X System is an endoscopic video imaging system that allows for the visualization of hemoglobin oxygen saturation (StO 2) levels of blood in superficial tissue using a 2D endoscopic image, which helps physicians identify tissue which is not appropri ately oxygenated and thus potentially ischemic. The EP -7000X System is comprised of the following components: (1) the video laparoscope EL -R740M; (2) the Processor VP -7000, which relays the image from an endoscope to a video monitor; (3) the Light Source BL -7000X, which employs five LEDs (Violet, Sky Blue, Blue, Green, and Amber); and (4) the Image Processing Unit EX -0, which has the Oxygen Saturation Endoscopic Imaging (OXEI) feature that receives endoscopic image data from the Processor and displays an image of StO 2 levels on a monitor using signal processing of the endoscopic image data. The Image Processing Unit provides two OXEI display modes: OXEI -P and OXEI -F. A user selects one of the OXEI modes to use at a time. The OXEI -P mode provides a heat map image of the StO 2 level where the vivid red corresponds to higher StO 2 level and dark blue to lower StO 2 level. The intermediate StO 2 level s are indicated by colors between the spectrum of red and blue, including yellow and green . The OXEI -F mode provides an over lay image where the StO 2 level image is superimposed on the regular image. The low -StO 2 level area where the StO 2 is less than a 58 defined threshold level is emphasized by a blue-tinged hue, wh ose chromaticity becomes stronger as the StO 2 level becomes lower. The threshold can be adjusted by the user. Procedure Description The requestor notes that using the endoscopic imaging system in the performance of a procedure is similar to other endoscopi c imaging systems and procedures, with a few additional steps (5 - 7) to obtain the StO 2 images: 1. Connect the scope connector to the Light Source that is connected to the Processor. 2. Power on the Processor, Light Source and Image Processing Unit. 3. The regular image is displayed on a monitor connected to the Processor. 4. The system is ready for a physician to insert the laparoscope or endoscope in a body cavity 5. The OXEI feature is activated and deactivated by pressing the scope switch on the laparoscope or endoscope, or the Light Mode button on the light source front panel. 6. The OXEI -P and OXEI -F modes are switched back and forth by pressing the foot switch provided with the Processor as an accessory. 7. The StO 2 threshold level for the OXEI -F mode is adjusted by pressing \" \" or \"\" key on the keyboard also provided with the Processor as an access ory. Current Coding: There are no unique ICD -10-PCS codes to describe adjunct endoscopic imaging of the tissue oxygen saturation levels of the GI tract during percutaneous endoscopic procedures. In these cases, only the procedure performed is reported. Coding Op tions Option 1. Do not create new ICD -10-PCS codes for the endoscopic imag ing of tissue oxygen saturation levels of the GI tract. Continue coding as described in current coding. Option 2 . Create new code s in section 4, Measurement and Monitoring, for the endoscopic imag ing of tissue oxygen saturation levels of the GI tract.

Interim Coding Advice: Continue us ing current codes as listed in current c oding. 60 Computer -Aided Mechanical Aspiration Thrombectomy Issue: There are currently no unique ICD -10-PCS codes to describe extirpation of matter from the arterial and venous systems using computer -aided mechanical aspiration that detects thrombus and blood flow. New Technology Application? Yes. The requestor has submitted a New Technology Add -on Payment (NTAP) application for FY 2022 consideration. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) Approval? Yes. FDA 510(k) clearance for the Penumbra Indigo\u00ae Aspiration System with Light ning Aspiration Tubing was received on March 13, 2020 (K193244) and updated on April 22, 2020 (K200771) to specify the pulmonary embolism (PE) indication. Background: Acute massive PE, defined as from acute PE, and acute submassive PE , defined by right ventricular strain without hypotension, are common life - threatening conditions that represent the serious manifestations of venous thromboembolic disease. The physiologic effect of massive PE is right ventricular failure, which reduces l eft ventricular preload and can lead to systemic hypotension and sudden death. Although submassive PE has a lower mortality than massive PE, it is associated with a higher mortality and higher rate of clinical deterioration than low -risk PE.1 Therapeutic anticoagulation is the standard of care first -line treatment; the 2016 American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP), 2019 European Society of Cardiology (ESC), and 2011 American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines all recommend the prompt use of anticoagula nt therapy (Grade 1b, Class Ia, and Class 1a respectively).2 However, according to the requestor, several studies have shown higher rates of in -hospital adverse events and pulmonary hypertension and poor functional status at follow -up in high risk submas sive PE patients given anticoagulants alone3. In addition to medical therapy , surgical thrombectomy and endovascular treatments may also be used for PE. Given the incomplete efficacy of anticoagulation alone and the potential bleeding complications of th rombolytics, endovascular catheter -directed therapy provides alternative options in treating PE. According to the requestor, a lthough there are other endovascular clot removal products indicated for use in PE on the market, none of these products uses a 1 Giri J, Sista AK, Weinberg I, et al.

Deep venous thrombosis (D VT), which is frequently the predecessor to PE, occurs when thrombus forms in the deep veins of the body, most often in the legs. As with PE, anticoagulation has been established as the standard treatment option for DVT to prevent PE and recurrent DVT4. Studies of anticoagulation in DVT suggested that presence of residual thrombus at 6 months dou bled the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE )5, leading to future research into additional thrombo - reductive strategies. Treatment options for DVT have expanded to include surgical thrombectomy and endovascular treatments6. Surgical intervention is invasive, requires general anesthesia, and may carry a small additional risk of PE5. Endovascular treatments include catheter -directed thrombolysis (CDT) thrombolysis (PCDT). CDT allows a thrombolytic agent to be infused directly into the thrombus by using a catheter with multiple side -holes. PCDT combines catheter -directed thrombolysis and percutaneous mechanical thromb reduces thrombolytic drug exposure. The use of endovascular thrombolysis as an adjunct to anticoagulant therapy is considered reasonable in several acute DVT scenarios; however, the potential benefit must be weighed carefully against the increas ed risk of bleeding5. Given the incomplete efficacy of anticoagulation alone and the potential bleeding complications of thrombolytics, endovascular catheter -directed therapy provides alternative options in treating VTE. Percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy devices provide alternative treatment options that may address the concerns with anticoagulation and thrombolytics in patients with VTE. According to the req uestor, a s with PE, the I ndigo\u00ae System is the only mechanical thrombectomy aspiration device that can detect when the catheter is in thrombus or patent flow in order to reduce blood loss when used for treatment of DVT. In acute limb ischemia ( ALI), the rapid onset of perfusion limitation (<14 days) threatens limb viability because of insufficient time for adequate collateral recruitment7. Uncertainty remains regarding interventional outcomes for ALI patients, and despite recent improvements in therapeuti c technique and declines in 1 -year amputation rate, there have been no significant improvements in 1 -year amputation -free survival, which remains unchanged at 52.3%8.

Eur J 62 are at risk of limb loss, with prompt treatment and revascularization urgently indicated for limb salvage. Contemporary revascularization guidelines for ALI include, but are not limited to, CDT and surgical thromboembolectomy10. Over the past decades, the surgical management of ALI has evolved to include endovascular approaches11, especially following the publication of three randomized, multicenter trials that established the efficacy of CDT as compared with surgical revascularization12. Catheter -directed thrombolysis13, along with newer endovascular approaches, have become routine for restoring perfusion in ALI patients14. Nevertheless, the cost of ALI -relate d complications and mortality remains high, leading to strong interest in assessing the efficacy of different revasculariz ation devices and procedures15. The requestor stated t he Indigo\u00ae System is the only mechanical thrombectomy aspiration device that can detect when the catheter is in thrombus or patent flow in order to reduce blood loss when used for treatment of ALI. Technology According to the requestor, u nlike the other endovascular clot removal products discussed above, the Indigo\u00ae System uses a mechanical pump (the Penumbra Engine\u00ae) to generate a vacuum for aspiration. Additionally, the Lightning tubing is the technology aspect of the Indigo\u00ae System that detects when the catheter is in patent flow (and therefore removing blood) or in thrombus (and removing clot). This technology automatically stops and starts the Penumbra Engine\u00ae to reduce blood loss (e.g., stopping the pump when the catheter is in patent flow, and starting when the physician moves the catheter back into thrombus). The Lightnin g tubing provides audio and visual signals to the physician when the Indigo\u00ae System is in each of these states to help the physician know when to move the catheter for better clot removal. The requestor stated n o other system on the market has this capabi lity. Procedure Description In this procedure, the provider treats an occlusion in a noncoronary or non -intracranial artery, vein or in an arterial bypass graft by using a technique of mechanical aspiration thrombectomy. The procedure includes vascular access (typically via the femoral vein) and manipulating the catheter to the clot under imaging guidance, including through the heart to the pulmonary arteries for treatment of PE. Once to the clot, the Lightning component of the Indigo\u00ae System is turned on and the physician uses auditory and visual clues to engage and remove the thrombus with the assistance of imaging. The Lightning component also has sensors that detect whether the device Vasc J.M., Ahn, S., and Jones, D.N. (1997 ).

New Technology Application? Yes. The requestor has submitted a New Technology Add -on Payment (NTAP) application for FY 2022 consideration. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) Approval? The Harmony transcatheter pulmonary valve ( TPV ) received the FDA Brea kthrough Device designation on May 01, 2019. As an FDA - designated Breakthrough Technology device , the Harmony TPV is the first transcatheter pulmonary valve that is designed to treat the patient's condition at the native site of the pulmonary valve witho ut a pre -existing valved conduit or pre -existing bioprosthetic valve. FDA approval is expected first quarter 2021. Background: The pulmonary valve is located between the right ventricle and the main pulmonary artery. Normally, deoxygenated blood is pump ed from the right ventricle through the pulmonary valve and into the main pulmonary artery on its way to the lungs to become reoxygenated . The pulmonary valve functions to prevent backflow of blood into the right ventricle. Anatomically, the upper extens ion of the right ventricle through the pulmonary valve and into the main pulmonary artery comprises the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT). Disorders of the pulmonary valve, such as pulmonary valve stenosis and atresia, cause obstruction of the RVOT , hindering the flow of blood to the lungs for reoxygenation. Most pulmonary valve disorders are congenital. Patients with congenital pulmonary valve defects require early intervention to relieve the RVOT obstruction. This typically takes place in infancy, with many patients undergoing multiple procedures through out their childhood. Early intervention for pulmonary valve disorders can take multiple forms: - Creation of a Blalock -Thomas -Taussig (BTT) shunt from the subclavian or innominate artery to the right or left pulmonary artery - Percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty of the existing anomalous pulmonary valve - Reconstruction of the RVOT via incision and patch graft - Surgical placement of a right ventricular -pulmonary artery (RV -PA) valved co nduit The procedures performed early in life are mostly palliative in that they are not intended as permanent correction. Instead, these procedures allow the patient to develop while delaying surgical replacement of the pulmonary valve until the patient has completed growing. Some of the early interventions to relieve obstruction and stenosis later lead the patient to develop pulmonary valve insufficiency (regurgitation). The BTT shunt, balloon valvuloplasty, and RVOT patch graft primarily focus on the immediate need to improve blood flow to the lungs, without addressing the backflow of blood into the right ventricle. Although pulmonary valve insufficiency (regurgitation) can be tolerated for varying periods, there are long -term consequences. Backflow ev entually leads to chronic volume overload, right ventricular hypertrophy, and right -sided heart failure as well as development of significant arrhythmias. 68 Eventual replacement of the pulmonary valve, typically performed when the patient is a young adult, is necessary as a permanent correction and to address the consequences of backflow. Pulmonary valve replacement is currently an open surgical procedure. Recently, a new procedure has been developed for transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement at its nativ e site between the right ventricle and the main pulmonary artery . Technology and Procedure The transcatheter procedure at the valve's native site is typically performed for Tetralogy of Fallot with either pulmonary valve stenosis or pulmonary atresia. Less commonly, it may be performed for truncus arteriosus, double -outlet right ventricle, and o ther congenital conditions which affect blood flow to the lungs. According to the requestor, p atients who undergo the new transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement procedure at the native site had previously been palliatively treated with either a BTT shun t, balloon valvulop lasty, or RVOT patch graft. This procedure at the native site is not performed on patients who had previously received a valved RV -PA conduit. The transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement procedure uses a unique bioprosthetic valve. Zooplastic valve tissue is mounted onto an hourglass -shaped nitinol frame for delivery and proper seating at the native site. The procedure begins with access to the central venous system, typically the femoral vein at the groin or the internal jugular vei n, and placement of a venous sheath. After a catheter is introduced into the right side of the heart, angiography of the right ventricular outflow tract is performed, noting the bifurcation of the right and left pulmonary arteries. The valve is loaded onto a delivery system. The delivery system is placed into the venous sheath and maneuvered over a guidewire into the superior vena cava. It is then advanced into the right atrium, through the tricuspid valve, and into the right ventricle. From the right ventr icle, the delivery system is maneuvered into the main pulmonary artery and advanced to the bifurcation, with its distal component directed into either the left or right pulmonary artery. Under fluoroscopy, the sheath enclosing the valve is sequentially wit hdrawn. The valve expands into position and is then released. The valve's position between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery is confirmed using angiography. Intracoronary echocardiography may also be performed to assess the function of the new v alve leaflets and identify any valve leakage. Following removal of the delivery system and other instruments, the venous access is closed. The requestor noted this new transcatheter procedure replaces the pulmonary valve at its native site between the right ventricle and the main pulmonary artery. The requestor also noted that t here is another type of transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement which has been performed for approximately 10 years, but it does not take place at the native site. Instead, this type of transcatheter pulmonary replacement is performed within a previously placed RV -PA conduit. The RV-PA conduit is designed with a bioprosthetic valve inside the conduit which takes over the function of the pulmonary valve, albeit at a different location. As the patient grows, if the valve within the conduit develops dysfunction , the valve can be replaced by implanting another valve within the conduit via a transc atheter \"valve -in-valve\" technique. Current Coding: There are no unique ICD -10-PCS codes to uniquely identify transcatheter replacement of the pulmonary valve at the native site. Facilities can report the procedure using the appropriate code in table 02R, Replacement of Heart and Great Vessels. 69 Section 0 Medical and Surgical Body System 2 Heart and Great Vessels Operation R Replacement: Putting in or on biological or synthetic material that physically takes the place and/or function of all or a portion of a body part Body Part Approach Device Qualifier F Aortic Valve G Mitral Valve H Pulmonary Valve J Tricuspid Valve 3 Percutaneous 7 Autologous Tissue Substitute 8 Zooplastic Tissue J Synthetic Substitute K Nonautologous Tissue Substitute H Transapical Z No Qualifier Coding Options Option 1.

New Technology Application? Yes. The requestor has submitted a New Technology Add -on Payment (NTAP) application for FY 2022 consideration. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) Approval? No. This device is currently seeking Premarket Approval (PMA) from th e FDA. T he device received Breakthrough Device designation on March 20, 2020 . Background: Replacement of the aortic arch is technically challenging, and is associated with a high risk of perioperative death and stroke. When disease involving the arch extends into the descending thoracic aorta, a two -stage repair is commonly necessary. The first stage entails replacement of the ascending aorta and transverse arch with an elephant trunk (ET) graft. The second stage is generally accomplished after an int erval for patient recovery and requires treatment of the descending thoracic or thoracoabdominal aorta with a separate endograft. Although the traditional ET technique has greatly facilitated the management of patients with extensive thoracic aortic diseas e, a second -stage operation is usually inevitable. The medical condition of the patient will dictate if and when this occurs. The objective of the second stage is to achieve exclusion of the disease and in the case of aortic dissection, promote thrombosis of the false lumen. The requestor notes that i f a second stage operation does not take place, then the perigraft lumen of the aorta remains perfused and thrombosis is not always achieved. This leaves the aneurysm pressurized and often leads to fatal aorti c rupture. Additionally, although the ET technique creates a long, prosthetic landing zone for second -stage endovascular procedures, it is considered mobile, unsupported and at risk of kinking. Technology and Procedure The Thoraflex Hybrid device is a dual purpose medical device that replaces the ascending aorta and aortic arch while also stabilizing and repairing the descending thoracic aorta in a single procedure, performed by a cardiothoracic surgeon. It is preloaded into a delivery system, which is designed to offer safe delivery and accurate deployment. The descending thoracic aorta is repaired by placing the stented distal end of the device via an antegrade transluminal approach through the transected aorta and into the descending thoracic aorta. T he device is secured by suturing an integral collar portion of the product to the distal native aortic remnant. The ascending aorta and aortic arch are then resected and replaced with the proximal, non -stented portion of the device. The device is fully gel atin-sealed and comprises a woven polyester proximal branched arch graft pre -sewn to an anastomotic sewing collar and distal stent. According to the requestor, t he collar ensures easier anastomosis of the device to the aorta by reducing the hemodynamic tra ction on the anastomosis. The device is available in a number of proximal graft sizes, distal stent diameters and currently two design configurations. The first configuration is the Thoraflex Hybrid Plexus Graft, a multi - branch design that enables indiv idual aortic arch branch reconstruction. The second configuration, 72 the Thoraflex Hybrid Ante -Flo design, allows the island technique where the aortic arch branches and associated aortic tissue are reattached as a patch to an opening cut in the graft. The se alternative techniques offer different surgical strategies for patient treatment. Current Coding: There are no unique ICD -10-PCS codes to identify thoracic aortic arch replacement combined with restriction of the descending thoracic aorta. Facilities ca n report the thoracic aortic arch replacement using the appropriate code in table 02R, Replacement of Heart and Great Vessels, and the restriction of the descending thoracic aorta using the appropriate code in table 02V, Restriction of Heart and Great Vess els.

New Technology Application? Yes. The requestor has submitted a New Technology Add -on Payment (NTAP) application for FY 2022 consideration. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) Approval? No. FDA approval for the coronary IVL is expected in early 2021. The coronary IVL system has received Breakthrough Device Designation from the FDA. Background: Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug -eluting stent (DES) implantation is the most frequent mode of coronary revascularization. Advanced age and an increasing frequency of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and renal insufficiency c ontribute to an increasing prevalence and severity of vascular calcification. Despite the use of high pressure noncompliant balloon catheters, cutting/scoring balloons and atheroablative technologies to modify calcium, PCI of heavily calcified lesions may be associated with early complications (e.g., dissection, perforation, myocardial infarction [MI]) and/or late adverse events (e.g., restenosis, fracture, thrombosis and need for repeat revascularization). Coronary calcification may impede stent delivery and deployment, leading to under expansion, malposition, or direct damage to the stent surface, potentially impairing drug delivery. Suboptimal stent expansion is the strongest predictor of subsequent stent thrombosis and restenosis. Although athe rectomy facilitates stent expansion, the extent of calcium modification is limited by guidewire bias and may be associated with peri -procedural complications including slow -flow, no -reflow, coronary dissection, perforation, and MI. Coronary intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) is a new treatment option for treating calcified lesions in the coronary arteries. Coronary IVL utilizes controlled sound waves in short pulses to selectively crack intimal and medial calcium within the vessel wall without affecting soft tissue. Once fractured, the calcium's resistance to balloon dilatation is reduced, thereby allowing the blood vessel to be dilated using a low -pressure angioplasty balloon prior to coronary stenting. Procedure Description The primary mechanism of act ion of coronary IVL therapy is lithotripsy, which is generated from multiple lithotripsy emitters that are integrated into a semi -compliant balloon -catheter platform. The coronary IVL catheter is advanced to the target lesion and the integrated balloon is inflated with fluid at a low pressure to contact the arterial wall. Coronary IVL is then activated, creating a small bubble within the catheter balloon that rapidly expands and collapses. The rapid expansion and collapse of the bubble creates sonic pressu re waves that travel through the innermost layer of the vessel wall and crack the calcium within the vessel wall. Current Coding: Currently, facilities report balloon angioplasty with or without stent insertion to treat calcified lesions in the coronary arteries with codes in table 027. The performance of coronary intravascular lithotripsy is not reported separately for inpatient hospital coding. 75 Coding Op tions Option 1.

New Technology Application? Yes. The requestor has submitted a New Technology Add -on Payment (NTAP) application for FY 2022 consideration. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) Approval? Yes. The Ellipsys\u00ae Vascular Access System received a De Novo Reclassification Order (DEN170004) on June 18, 2018. A subsequent 510(k) approval, which included balloon angioplasty as a procedural step to immediately follow anastomosis creation during percutaneous AVF, was received on August 19, 2019. Background: Access to the blood stream is necessary for hemodialysis in the treatment of end - stage renal disease. This access can be provided by a catheter, graft, or AVF; the latter is generally preferred for patients whose vascular anatomy and condition permits it. Until recently, the only method for creating an AVF was th rough an open surgical approach. Today, an AVF can be created percutaneously using the Ellipsys\u00ae Vascular Access System or an alternative technology , the WavelinQ EndoAVF System. Technology The Ellipsys\u00ae Vascula r Access System is a device that enables percutaneous creation of an AVF using thermal resistance energy . According to the requestor , a percutaneous AVF, or pAVF, provides a n alternative option to traditional surgically -created AVF s and offers a number of advantages. The pAVF created by the Ellipsys\u00ae Vascular Access System is between a vein and an artery that remain side -by-side and is distinct from the surgical \"end -to-side\" approach used for most surgical AVFs, where one vessel is truncated and the end is attached to the side of another vessel. The requestor notes that t he pAVF side-by-side approach contributes to improvements in the performance of the procedure such as successful fistula creation, time to two -needle cannulation, and cumulative patency over several years. In addition, the requestor notes that pAVFs created using the Ellipsys\u00ae Vascular Access System have demonstrated better outcomes compared to those procedures performed us ing the currently available alternative pAVF technology, including having a higher fraction of cases with clinically functional AVFs, speedier maturation, more durable AVFs and a lower failure rate. Procedure Description During the creation of a pAVF u sing the Ellipsys\u00ae Vascular Access System, the cubital vein is cannulated under ultrasound guidance . The physician inserts a needle through the vein , punctures the lumen of the adjacent proximal radial artery , and advances a guidewire into the artery . A sheath is tracked over the guidewire and advanced into the artery. A single Ellipsys\u00ae catheter is then inserted through the sheath and positioned so its distal tip is in the artery. The sheath is withdrawn, and the catheter is used to mechanically capture and compress the walls of artery and vein. The power source is activated and thermal resistance energy ( i.e., direct heat) is precisely applied to fuse the artery and vein adventitia together and cut an elliptical anastomosis, permanently connecting the artery and vein. The catheter is removed, allowing blood to flow through the anastomosis, creating an AVF. The flow through the fistula is assessed usin g Doppler ultrasound; it is immediately increased by balloon angioplasty of the anastomosis. The 77 percutaneous AVF created using the Ellipsys\u00ae Vascular Access System differs from the alternative technol ogy (WavelinQ ) for creating a p AVF in the following wa ys: Source of energy thermal resistance for Ellipsys\u00ae, radiofrequency for WavelinQ ; Number of specialized catheters employed one for Ellipsys\u00ae, two for WavelinQ ; and Additional procedural steps - balloon angioplasty for Ellipsys\u00ae, embolization for WavelinQ ; and Form of imaging involved ultrasound for Ellipsys\u00ae, fluoroscopy and ultrasound for WavelinQ . Current Coding: There are no unique ICD -10-PCS to identify percutaneous creation of an arterio venous fistula using thermal resistance energy. Facilities can report the procedure using one of the following code(s): 031B3ZF Bypass right radial artery to lower arm vein, percutaneous approach 031C3ZF Bypass left radial artery to lower arm vein, percutaneous approach A code for the angiopl asty from table 037, Dilation of Upper Arteries, would be reported separately.

New Technology Application? Yes. The requestor has submitted a New Technology Add -on Payment (NTAP) application for FY 2022 consideration. Food & Drug Admini stration (FDA) Approval? No, the Phagenyx\u00ae System has not yet received FDA Approval. The Phagenyx\u00ae System received Breakthrough Device Designation for the treatment of neurogenic dysphagia in adult tracheotomized patients weaned from mechanical ventilati on in 2019. In 2021, the FDA expanded Breakthrough Device Designation to include the treatment of non -progressive neurogenic dysphagia. Background: Neurogenic dysphagia is dysphagia arising from the disruption of any of the neurological systems or proc esses involved in the execution of a coordinated safe swallow. A broad range of different underlying diseases (neurological or non -neurological) or care management interventions, like mechanical ventilation, can give rise to this form of neurological disru ption, which can manifest as desensitization or dysfunction of local neurological sensory systems, a disruption of control systems in the swallow motor cortex, or both. Neurogenic dysphagia is commonly seen after stroke, traumatic brain injury or prolonge d mechanical ventilation. It can also be complicated by a combination of those factors, e.g., dysphagia arising from an initial insult to the brain (stroke, trauma or inflammation) is further complicated following extended mechanical ventilation due to loc al desensitization/disuse atrophy of swallow -related nerves and muscles. Dysphagia routinely results in an unsafe airway due to the inability of the patient to manage or clear pooled secretions in the hypopharynx. These secretions can enter the lower airw ays and can make their way to the lower respiratory spaces and act as a locus for infection (aspiration pneumonia). Dysphagic patients also routinely lack an effective cough . In the case of ventilated patients with tracheostomy tubes, poor secretion manag ement and an ineffective cough can prevent the tube from being safely removed (decannulated) after respiratory function has recovered. Delayed decannulation increases length of stay, significantly increases burden of care, limits discharge options, increa ses risk of tissue damage, prevents oral and speech rehabilitation, and increases risk of pneumonia. Dysphagia also gives rise to an ineffective swallow, which affects nutritional intake and quality of life. Patients with an ineffective swallow must be fed via tube or via modified oral intake. This creates a substantial burden of care, extends hospital length of stay, reduces discharge rates to a home setting, reduces quality of life, and increases risk of infection and re-hospitalization. A US -specific dy sphagia impact study published in 2017 by Patel et al1 showed that after adjusting for patient characteristics, comorbidity and hospital related factors, the absolute in - hospital mortality is 2.9% higher per year in patients with dysphagia. This translates into up to 19,000 additional deaths per year among US patients specifically due to dysphagia. 1 Patel D. A., Krishnaswami S., Steger E., Conover E., Vaezi M. F., Ciucci M. R., Francis D. O. Economic and survival burden of dysphagia among inpatients in the United States. Diseases of the Esophagus (2018) 31, 1 -7 79 Technology The Phagenyx\u00ae System is designed to treat neurogenic dysphagia. Phagenyx\u00ae uses electrical pulses to stimulate sensory nerves in the oropharynx. According to the requestor, o nce stimulated, these nerves send signals to the motor cortex in the brain, increasing cortical activity, promoting neuroplasticity and restoring swallowing control through functional cortical reorganization. In addition, Phage nyx\u00ae treatment results in beneficial changes in the local sensory mechanisms of the pharyngeal mucosa linked to swallow and cough reflex through an increase in the swallow -related neurotransmitter Substance P. The requestor notes that Phagenyx\u00ae System doe s not treat the underlying diseases that give rise to dysphagia ; it treats the common neurological symptoms and swallowing deficits that these diseases cause (i.e., neurogenic dysphagia). The Phagenyx\u00ae System is comprised of a sterile single patient use c atheter and a Base Station. The catheter is a two -part fine bore flexible tube that is introduced intranasally and extends to the patients' stomach. It incorporates two bipolar ring electrodes on its outer surface to deliver the electrical stimulation. The catheter design also incorporates an optional feeding lumen, which can be used to administer nutrition and fluids if required, meaning that only one tube is required for both treatment and feeding. The Base Station is a touch -screen user interface that fa cilitates the optimization of stimulation levels and stores patient and treatment information. Procedure Description 1. Prior to insertion, the Phagenyx\u00ae catheter is adjusted to fit the patient's anatomy. Using integrated guides to help confirm position, the catheter is inserted intranasally and passed through the pharynx and esophagus, until the tip is located in the stoma ch, and the electrodes are in the oropharynx. Pharyngeal Electrical Stimulation (PES) electrical fields act on the pharyngeal mucosa, base of the tongue, epiglottis, and the area above the larynx (primarily the oropharynx and part of the laryngopharynx) , with peripheral sensory nerves IX and X targeted. 2. The catheter is connected to the Base Station and stimulation is incrementally increased to establish the Threshold Level (lowest current the patient can detect) and Tolerance Level (highest level they can t olerate). A Stimulation Level is derived from these two values. This must be done for each treatment. 3. 10 minutes of treatment are delivered once per day for three consecutive days. For the minority of patients that do not respond to three treatments, up t o a maximum of three more treatments are permitted. 4. Only one catheter is used per patient for the whole treatment regimen (i.e., it stays in place between treatment sessions). Once all treatments are completed, the catheter is removed and disposed of in cl inical waste. Alternatively, if required, the catheter can be left in place for up to 30 days to facilitate feeding. 5. Following treatment, medical records are updated to denote PES was performed with the Phagenyx\u00ae System. 80 Current Coding: Facilities ca n report the placement of electrodes in the oropharynx to stimulate sensory nerves using electrical pulses with the following code: 0CHY7YZ Insertion of other device into mouth and throat, via natural or artificial opening Facilities can also report the insertion of a feeding tube using the appropriate code in table 0DH, Insertion of Gastrointestinal System. Coding Options Option 1. Do not create new ICD -10-PCS codes for the use of electrical pulses to stimulate sensory n erves in the oropharynx. Continue using current codes as listed in current coding. Option 2 . Create new codes in section 0, Medical and Surgical, to identify the use of electrical pulses to stimulate sensory nerves in the oropharynx.

New Technology Application? No. However, t he requestor intends to submit a New Technology Add -on Payment (NTAP) application in October 2021 for FY 202 3 consideration . Food & Drug Administration (FDA) Approval? No. The FlowSense Noninvasive Thermal Sensor received Breakthrough Device Designation from the FDA in June 2020. Background: Hydrocephalus is a debilitating neurological disorder that results from the overproduction and/or impaired reabsorption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the ventricles of the brain. Causes include congeni tal malformations, intracerebral hemorrhage, infection, trauma, and tumors. The condition can occur in nearly all age groups from infants to elderly patients, with the latter group particularly susceptible to idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) . Hydrocephalus affects over 1 million people in the United States alone. In nearly all cases, the treatment involves surgical implantation of a pressure -regulated silicone tube assembly, known as a 'shunt'. Ventricular shunt assemblies typically involve two silicone catheters, connected upstream and downstream of a regulating valve, to drain excess fluid away from the cerebral ventricles to a distal absorptive site, such as the peritoneum, pleural cavity, or right atrium. Unfortunately, shunts suffer fro m high failure rates, which results in an impaired quality of life for both patients and their caregivers due to the uncertainty associated with the potential for shunt failure. The symptoms of shunt failure are identical to those of hydrocephalus and are non-specific, including headaches, nausea, dizziness, and drowsiness. Catheter occlusion or malfunction can be difficult to diagnose without medical imaging or surgery. As a result, patients commonly undergo a range of diagnostic procedures for these vagu e symptoms, including evaluating the size of the cerebral ventricles with computed tomography (CT) scans or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and evaluating for disconnection or fracture of the shunt tubing with X -ray imaging, known as a 'shunt -series'. According to the requestor, such procedures represent indirect measures and they suffer from a combination of low accuracy, radiation exposure, and in the case of MRIs in pediatric patients, the need for anesthesia. More direct measures of shunt patency in clude nuclear medicine \"shunt function\" studies where a radionucleotide tracer is directly injected into the shunt system. However, the requestor notes this procedure can be painful, can introduce infection into the shunt, and it is poorly suited to pediat ric populations. Similarly, lumbar puncture tests also rely on hollow needles to collect spinal CSF for the assessment of pressure and viral infections. In some cases, patients are admitted to the hospital for long -term observation or to undergo explorator y surgeries to definitively rule out shunt malfunction. Technology FlowSense is a wireless, noninvasive thermal flow sensor that can be mounted on a patient's neck overlying the shunt to detect the presence and magnitude of CSF . FlowSense enables monitoring of CSF flow, which can potentially eliminate delays with diagnostic testing and expedite appropriate triage and treatment for patients . FlowSense uses measurements of temperature and heat transfer to non-invasively tell if an d how much fluid is flowing through a shunt in a hydrocephalus patient. 82 Similar in size to a bandage, it is composed of soft silicone with no hard edges. Data is wirelessly transmitted to a custom designed mobile app. Procedure Description FlowSense assesses the flow of CSF through an existing implanted CSF shunt non -invasively via the following steps: 1) The CSF shunt tube is localized in a skin region where the tube is superficial (within about 4 mm of the surface). The most superficial region is typica lly on or near the clavicle, where the shunt tube must pass over the bone. Localization is typically performed via visual inspection and palpation, but may also include the use of ultrasound in rare cases. 2) The FlowSense device is adhered to the skin over the localized shunt tubing. The device, which is about the size of an adhesive bandage, must be aligned with the tubing for successful measurement. 3) The device is powered on and wirelessly paired to a receiver via Bluetooth. A flashing LED on the device in dicates the device status and assists with pairing. 4) A device measurement is initiated by following the prompts on a mobile app, which guides the provider through the measurement process. The device automatically applies heat and measures the temperature o n the skin. The mobile app may also indicate an error or warning in the event that a measurement issue occurs, for example if the device is not adhered properly to the patient's skin. The measurement itself takes about five minutes to complete. 5) The device measurement results, which are displayed on the receiver, are recorded in the patient's medical record. 6) The provider interprets the results of the measurement by applying their knowledge of and experience with a) shunt function and malfunction, b) the dy namics of normal and abnormal CSF flow, c) the patient's history, symptoms, and level of shunt dependence, and d) any additional tests that have been performed (for example, a radiology scan). These steps, which are performed sequentially, typically take about 20 minutes. The procedure gives important spot check information on the presence of flow in the CSF shunt to a physician in order to assist in the determination of shunt function or malfun ction. The procedure can be performed in the emergency department for patients showing sy mptoms of shunt malfunction, in a pre-operative setting for patients undergoing a CSF shunt revision surgery (to vali date shunt malfunction), and in a post -operative setting after shunt placement surgery (to confirm functionality of a newly -implanted shunt). According to the requestor, the only known complication associated with this procedure is the potential for skin irritation due to the device adhesive. Current C oding: The non-invasive assessment of the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) through an existing implanted CSF shunt is not reported separately for inpatient hospital coding. Facilities can report the CT scan, if performed, using the appropriate code(s) i n section B, Imaging. Coding Op tions Option 1. Do not create new ICD -10-PCS codes for the non-invasive assessment of the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) through an existing implanted CSF shunt. Continue coding as listed in current coding. 83 Option 2 .

New Technology Application? Yes. The requestor has submitted a New Technology Add -on Payment (NTAP) application for FY 2022 consideration. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) Approval? Yes. The Pure -Vu\u00ae System received 510(k) clearance May 4, 2019. Background: Indication s for colonoscopy can be for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes and may be performed on patients with conditions such as acute lower GI bleeding, hematochezia, incessant diarrhea, constip ation, unknown abdominal pain, I rritable Bowel S yndrome, Inflammatory Bowel Disease (Crohns, colitis), or a mass found on computed tomography (CT) . Achieving hemostasis as quickly as possible in p atients that require an urgent colonoscopy most commonly due to GI bleeding can be critical to the patient, reduce the need for transfusions and the hospital length of stay . In addition, inadequate preparation of the bowel may result in d elayed or repeat colonoscopies , thereby extend ing the hospital length of stay for these patients and potentially create s a significant burden with extend ed preparation time and increase d risks. The Pure-Vu\u00ae System is targeted for patients that need to under go a colonoscopy and are unable to have an adequate p reparation due to comorbidities or motility issues , have contraindications for traditional bowel prep , or have an emergent issue such as a significant lower GI bleed for which there is not sufficient time for preprocedural preparation. Technology According to the requestor , the Pure -Vu\u00ae System is an oversleeve based, high intensity intra - procedural cleansing device for colonoscopy procedures . It is designed to connect to currently marketed colonoscopes to avoid aborted and delayed procedures due to poor visualization of the colon mucosa by providing high intensity intra -procedural cleansing of the colon during a colonoscopy. The requestor states t his is achieved by the device creating a unique High Intensity, Pulsed Vortex Irrigation Jet that consists of a mixture of air and water to break -up fecal matter, blood clots and other debris and scrub the walls of the colon while simultane ously removing the debris through two suction channels. The suction channels have a sensor to detect the formation of a clog in the channels. If the sensor detects a clog forming , it then triggers the system to automatically purge the material out of the c hannel and back into the colon where it can be further emulsified by the Pulsed Vortex Irrigation Jet and then automatically reverts back into suction mode once the channel is cleared. The Pure -Vu\u00ae System is comprised of a Workstation (WS) that controls t he function of the system, a disposable Oversleeve that is mounted on a colonoscope and inserted into the patient and a disposable connector with tubing (Umbilical tubing with Main Connector) that provides the interface between the WS, the Oversleeve and o ff the shelf waste containers. The Pure -Vu\u00ae System also contains additional ancillary components required for mounting the disposable sleeve on a colonoscope. 85 Procedure Description The Pure -Vu\u00ae System is loaded over a colonoscope and is controlled b y foot pedals that allow the physician to activate the system as desired while navigating through the colon. The colonoscopy with the Pure -Vu\u00ae Oversleeve is advanced through the colon in the same manner as a standard colonoscopy. The system gives the physi cian the control to cleanse the colon as needed based on visual feedback from the colonoscope to make sure they have an unobstructed view of the colon mucosa to detect and treat any pathology. The requestor states it is import ant to note that since the Pure-Vu\u00ae system does not interfere with the working channel of the colonoscope , the physician is able to perform all diagnostic or therapeutic interventions in a standard fashion with an unobstructed field of view. Current Coding: There are no unique ICD -10-PCS codes to describe colonic irrigation performed intraoperatively with a disposable oversleeve for colonoscopy procedures. Facilities can report colonic irrigation for colonoscopy procedures using the following code: 3E1H88Z Irrigation of lower GI using irrigating substance, via natural or artificial opening endoscopic Coding Options Option 1.

New Technology Application? Yes. The requestor has submitted a New Technology Add -on Payment (NTAP) application for FY 2022 consideration. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) Approval? Yes. The Steripath\u00ae Micro Blood Collection System received 5 10(k) clearance from the FDA on October 8, 2020 . Background : A large number of patients who present symptomatic for sepsis are compromised, hypotensive (low blood pressure) and hypovolemic (low blood volume), have difficult intravenous access (DIVA) or are small in stature with lower blood volume. Clinicians typically utilize a syringe technique to collect blood from this patient population to enable management of negative pressure (attempting to avoid vein collapse) while improving the opportunity to collect a sufficient volume of blood to culture which is critical for sensitivity. Sources of contamination exist that techniques presently embodied in the standard of care pertaining to blood culture do not address including skin flora embedded too deeply to be affected by topical antiseptics. It has been proven that veni puncture dislodges fragments of skin that will (through the needle cannula) enter a blood culture bottle with the initial aliquot of a specimen1. There is no antiseptic that can perfectly sterilize skin and penetrate to reach deeply embedded organisms, whi ch is why manual diversion of the initial aliquot of a blood specimen was originally proposed and subsequently proven to reduce blood culture contamination rates2. According to the requestor, m anual diversion as a process improvement technique, though succ essful at reducing blood culture contamination, has shown only modest reduction in contamination. Therefore , the requestor states it remains self -limiting as a practical option for standard practice in that it adds approximately 6 -steps to an already compl ex procedure, introduces an additional opportunity for touch -based contamination to occur, requires additional time from the operator to perform and is not an engineered approach to ensure healthcare worker compliance and ensuing sustainable results . The gentle negative pressure created by the Steripath\u00ae Micro Blood Collection System 's unique bladder -driven mechanism of action is designed to achieve initial specimen diversion while avoiding collapsing of the veins (losing venous access) of this susceptible patient population. Technology and Procedure According to the requestor, Magnolia Medical Technologies, Inc., developed the Steripath\u00ae Initial Specimen Diversion Device\u00ae (ISDD\u00ae) as an active diversion vein -to-bottle closed system designed to augment standard blood culture practice. The Steripath\u00ae Micro Blood Collection System is a new single -use disposable ISDD\u00ae used for bloo d culture collection to reduce blood culture contamination and false positive diagnostic test result s for sepsis. The Steripath\u00ae ISDD\u00ae product 1 Buchta, C., N. Nedorost, H. Egerbacher, G. K\u00f6rm\u00f6czi, P. H\u00f6cker, and M. Dettke. 2005. Skin plugs in phlebot omy puncture for 2 for reducing blood culture contamination: initial specimen diversion technique. J Clin Microbiol. 2010 Dec;48(12):4501 -3 87 portfolio, including the Steripath\u00ae Micro ISDD\u00ae, is the only FDA 510(k) -cleared family of devices indicated to reduce blood culture contamination. Unlike manual diversion, Steripath\u00ae is by design a closed -system so as not to introduce opportunities for touch contamination beyond that which occurs with conventional methods of blood culture sample acquisition, and is provided as a preassembled and packaged sterile kit so as to not requi re set -up touch point contamination or additional time from the operator. The requestor reported that i rrespective of a healthcare system's use of nursing staff or dedicated phlebotomists to acquire blood culture samples, of whether a given facility was a teaching institution, government military or veterans administration hospital or large or small community hospital or emergency department there within, irrespective of sample size, and location, Steripath\u00ae implementation has resulted in a 73% to 100% redu ction in blood culture contamination across a broad array of large scale clinical datasets. The requestor states it uses a novel architecture that utilizes initial negative pressure driven by a syringe or blood culture bottle to invert a n internal bladder . The inversion of the bladder in turn creates gentle negative pressure to divert and sequester the initial 0.6 to 0.9 mL of blood collec ted from the patient, the portion known to most likely contain contaminants. Once diversion is complete, the user press es a side button to isolate the diverted blood and automatically a second independent blood flow path way opens to collect the blood specimen into the syringe (or blood culture bottle) for culture testing. Current Coding: There is no unique ICD -10-PCS code to identify the mechanical initial specimen diversion of whole blood by a single -use blood collection device using active negative pressure. Coding Options Option 1. Do not create new ICD -10-PCS codes for a single -use blood collection device that diverts the initial specimen from the portion used for blood culture. Continue coding as listed in current coding. Option 2 .

New Technology Application? Yes. The requestor has submitted a New Technology Add -on Payment (NTAP) application for FY 2022 consideration. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) Approval? No. Background: There are 695,000 ischemic strokes each year in the US, with 185,000 of these events being recurrent strokes. Up to 40% (250,000) of ischemic strokes are diagnosed as \"cryptogenic\" or unknown cause. Cryptogenic strokes have limited treatment available lead ing to high recurrence risk. When the cause of a stroke is identified, guideline -directed effective secondary prevention protocols may be adopted to prevent a more massive, costly, and severe recurrent stroke. When the cause is unknown, recurrent stroke r isk is five times greater than when the cause is determined, such as stroke due to undiagnosed atrial fibrillation. The key to secondary prevention (i.e. preventing another stroke through medical management) is identifying stroke etiology. For example, an ticoagulant therapy is indicated for cardioembolic stroke. This is in distinction to large artery atherosclerotic strokes where antiplatelet agents are recommended. The diagnostic workup to determine the cause of stroke can be complex and inconsistent acro ss hospitals, may require invasive procedures (implantable cardiac monitoring or transesophageal echocardiogram), may be lengthy, and is often inconclusive (cryptoge nic). The requestor notes that s ince the COVID -19 public health emergency, the cryptogenic stroke rate is calculated at 65% in COVID -19 populations, including patients presenting without traditional stroke comorbidities , making secondary stroke prevention difficult. The cause of stroke in COVID -19 patients is still not well understood . Clinical information is needed to determine stroke etiology , specifically, cardioembolic or large artery atherosclerosis cause s of stroke that have clear treatment and risk reduction guideline s. Respiratory screening that includes COVID -19, influenza, and other re spiratory viral and bacterial organisms, and the identification of COVID -19 antibodies to determine if the patient previously may have had COVID -19, is also needed. Technology According to the requestor, t he Ischemia Care Respiratory and Stroke Test ( ISC-REST) blood and swab collection kit is the first clinically available laboratory testing for ischemic stroke to assist with determining the cause of stroke bas ed on mRNA expression and respiratory status (including COVID -19) using blood and nasal specimen s. ISC - REST is indicated when a patient presents within 30 hours of symptom onset with a NIH Stroke Scale/Score (NIHSS) greater than or equal to five. ISC -REST combines (i) a blood test for cause of stroke (ISCDx), (ii) plus a respiratory panel that inclu des COVID -19 screening, (iii) plus a COVID -19 antibody test. The primary purpose of ISC-REST is to stratify ischemic stroke patients by cause, including COVID -19 status, to simplify care pathways to prevent a secondary stroke which is often more severe, co stly, and debilitating. The technology is based upon prior clinical research that has suggested whole blood mRNA expression may help differentiate ischemic stroke mechanisms. 90 Procedure Description The ISC -REST kit reports three test results to provid e information related to cause of ischemic stroke and COVID -19 status: First, ISCDx, a test result based upon a whole blood sample as a source of mRNA, to aid in the diagnosis of cardioembolic and large artery atherosclerotic stroke (two major leading stroke causes and affecting treatment decisions). The testing results indicate whether the gene expression in the sample was consistent with cardioembolic stroke or large artery atherosclerosis stroke. The test (ISCDx) is the result of the Biomarkers of Acute Stroke Etiology (BASE) clinical trial NCT02014896. The validated testing performance has a sensitivity of 89.66%, specificity of 70.00%, positive likelihood ratio of 2.99, negative likelihood ratio of 0.15, and accuracy of 84.62%. Second, the QIAstat -Dx R espiratory SARS -CoV -2 Panel is a multiplexed nucleic acid real - time PCR test intended for the qualitative detection and differentiation of nucleic acid from multiple respiratory viral and bacterial organisms, including the SARS -CoV -2 virus, in nasopharynge al swabs (NPS) eluted in universal transport media collected from patients suspected of COVID -19 by their healthcare provider. Third, the QIAGEN Access Anti -SARS -CoV -2 Total Test is a rapid, digital lateral flow serological test, using nanoparticle fluores cence, intended for qualitative detection of total antibodies to SARS -CoV -2 in human serum and plasma (heparin, EDTA). The Access Anti-SARS -CoV -2 Total Test is intended for use as an aid in identifying individuals with an adaptive immune response to SARS -CoV-2.

New Technology Application? Yes. The requestor intends to submit a New Technology Add - on Payment application for FY 2023. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) Approval? FDA Breakthrough Device Designation for Niyad as a regional anticoagulation device was granted for renal replacement therapy ( RRT ) on April 9, 2020 . It is regulated as a device because it anticoagulates blood outside the patient. Background: The kidneys are responsible for filtering and cleaning blood, producing the urine that carries liquid waste out of the body , and regulating the fluid bal ance of the body. When the kidneys begin to lose their ability to filter water and waste from the blood, kidney failure may result. Acute kidney failure (or acute kidney injury (AKI)) can be categorized as prerenal, postrenal, or renal. Prerenal failure a ccounts for approximately 60 -70% of all cases and occurs when the kidneys are not receiving enough blood to filter . This can happen for a number of reasons, including a significant drop in blood pressure due to blood loss from surgery, burns, severe injur ies, infections (E.g. sepsis), occlusion or restriction of a blood vessel carrying blood to the kidneys, heart failure or liver failure. If treated promptly, the condition can be reversed. Postrenal failure, also known as obstructive renal failure, occurs when a blockage or obstruction is present in the ureters or bladder , such as with kidney stones, bladder stones, or cancer. The kidneys often recover within a couple weeks once the obstruction is removed. Renal failure accounts for approximately 25 -40% of all cases and is considered the most complex. It may occur when conditions such as glomerulonephritis, acute interstitial nephritis, acute tubular necrosis, or polycystic kidney disease ar e present. Patients with a cute kidney failure that is unrespons ive to medications, intravenous fluids, or other medical treatment options to improve kidney function will generally need to receive dialysis through an artificial kidney machine. The machine circulates blood outside the patient, through a dialysis filter , and then returns blood to the patient. According to the requestor, exposure of blood to the dialysis filter may cause clotting that results in frequent filter changes, increased blood loss, increased transfusions, and delayed or prolonged treatment time. The requestor reported that a cute renal replacement therapy (RRT), which is performed over long periods of time (i.e., 24/7), with lower blood flow rates and slower ultrafiltration rates, is favored over standard intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) in criti cally ill patients who are unable to tolerate rapid solute removal, such as those suffering from AKI. During RRT, blood flows from the patient into a dialysis filter driven by a peristaltic pump . This procedure allows for blood purification and enables fl uid removal. The requestor stated that anticoagulation of the extracorporeal circuit is a desired feature of RRT because interaction of blood with the plastic materials in the extracorporeal circuit is thrombogenic and development of blood clots undermines performance of the hemodialyzer. If the entire circuit clots, the procedure is compromised; the process must be stopped , and the filter must be changed. According to the requestor, w hen this occurs the filter is discarded and, more significantly, the patient loses the clotted bloo d in the filter, which increases blood loss and the need for transfusions. As such, an 92 international consensus guideline known as the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guidelines for Acute Kidne y Injury (KDIGO 2012) recommends \"using anticoagulation during RRT in AKI if a patient does not have an increased bleeding risk or impaired coagulation and is not already receiving anticoagulation.\" (Level 1B, strong recommendation, moderate quality eviden ce). In addition, for patients with an increased risk of bleeding, the KDIGO guideline suggests using off-label citrate anticoagulation, rather than no anticoagulation, during RRT in a patient without contraindications for citrate. There are currently no approved regional anticoagulants in the US. Since there are no FDA -approved agents for regional anticoagulation, approximately 60% of acute RRT is initiated without the use of any anticoagulant .1 Some centers utilize citrate anticoagulation in an off-label fashion, though there are documented dangers such as life - threatening hypocalcemia or alkalosis. Technology Niyad is an anticoagulant for the dialysis filter that reduces blood clots. Nafamostat, the active ingredient of Niyad, is a small molecule, broad spectrum, protease inhibitor that inhibits thrombin at the platelet thrombin receptor, PAR1 .2 It also inhibits various enzyme systems, such as coagulation and fibrinolytic systems (Xa and XIIa), the the pancreatic proteases .3,4,5 According to the requestor, nafamostat has a small molecular weight of 539.59 Da and a short systemic circulation half -life (~8 minutes), making it ideally suited as a regional anticoagulant in extracorporeal circuits. When nafamostat is administered into the afferent limb of the RRT circuit, the blood becomes anticoagulated because of nafamostat 's rapid action on thrombin. As blood is transported into the hemodialyzer, nafamostat 's small molecular weight allows a significant proportion to be removed via filtration. Therefore , the amount of nafamostat that is returned to the patient via the efferent limb is limited and is rapidly metabolized. Thus, the anticoagulation effect of nafamostat is primarily limited to the RRT circuit . The requestor reported that nafamostat is approved and marketed as Futhan in Japan and South Korea for regional anticoagulation; it has no contraindications as an anticoagulant in RRT nor does it have any limitation on the treatment/administration period. Nafamostat can be used in 1 Bellomo R, Cass A, Cole L, Fin fer S, Gallagher M, Lo S, McArthur C, McGuinness S, Myburgh J, Norton R, Scheinkestel C, Su S.

Titrate the dose up or down to achieve the desired the lev el of anticoagulation. Current Coding: There are no unique ICD -10-PCS codes to describe regional anticoagulation in an extracorporeal dialysis circuit with nafamostat .

New Technology Application? No. However, t he requestor intends to submit a New Technology Add -on Payment (NTAP) application for FY 202 3 consideration . Food & Drug Administration (FDA) Approval? No. Immunexpress is expecting FDA clearance for SeptiCyte\u00ae RAPID in the second quarter of 2021. Additionally, Immunexpress is expecting to supplement their 510K for use of SeptiCyte with EDTA tubes short ly after initial FDA clearance. Background: Sepsis, until recently, has been clinically defined as \"the prese nce (probable or documented) of infection together with systemic manifestations of infection.\"1,2 Sepsis is a complex, poorly understood immuno -pathological disorder characterized by a pro -inflammatory response that may be followed by an anti -inflammatory, immunosuppressive state, or may cycle between states over several weeks. An early, uncontrollabl e excessive or hyper -inflammatory response can be associated with septic shock, then cardiovascular collapse, metabolic derangements, multiple organ dysfunction, and finally death within days of onset. The Third International Consensus Definitions for Sep sis and Septic Shock (Sepsis -3), published in 2016, changed the definitions and clinical criteria of sepsis and septic shock. Sepsis -3 now defines sepsis as \"a life -threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection.\" Theref ore, the key to diagnosing sepsis according to the new definition lies in determining whether the host has a dysregulated immune response, and whether that response is due to an infection. Technology SeptiCyte\u00ae RAPID is a gene expression assay that can assist in the discrimination between the presence of sepsis (i.e. infection positive systemic inflammation) and infection negative systemic inflammation (SIRS). SeptiCyte\u00ae RAPID uses a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction to measure the relative expression levels of host response genes isolated from whole blood collected in either general EDTA tubes or PAXgene\u00ae Blood RNA Tube s. SeptiCyte\u00ae RAPID generates a score (SeptiScore) that falls within one of three discrete interpretation bands based on the increasing likelihood of infection -positive systemic inflammation. SeptiCyte\u00ae RAPID molecular analysis is used in conjunction with clinical assessments, vital signs and laboratory findings as an aid to differentiate infection -positive sepsis from systemic inflammatory response syndrome or infection negative systemic inflammation (SIRS or INSI) in critically ill adults . SeptiCyte\u00ae RAPID has been shown to have clinical validity and reliability in banked samples from two observational clinical trials that supported the 510K clearance of SeptiCyte LAB: the VENUS trial (NCT02127502) and the MARS trial (NCT0190503 3). 1 Dellinger R P, et al. (2013). Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock, 2012. Intensive care medicine, 39(2), 165 -228. 2 Dellinger R P, et al. (2013). Surviving sepsis campaign: international guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock: 2012. Critical care medicine, 41(2), 580 -637. 96 SeptiCyte\u00ae RAPID is intended for diagnostic use and will be used in the inpatient setting to facilitate the diagnosis of sepsis to improve medical treatment and patient recovery. Procedure Description SeptiCyte\u00ae RAPID consists of collection of bloo d in an EDTA tube or PAXgene\u00ae blood RNA tube followed by pipetting 900l directly from PAXgene blood tube or 240 ul from EDTA tube to the lysis chamber of the test cartridge. The test cartridge is used with the Idylla platform, which is a fully automated RT-PCR based molecular testing system. Inside the cartridge, a combination of chemical reagents, lytic enzymes, heat, and High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) induces lysis of the cells within the cartridge. The nucleic acids are liberated for subseq uent reverse transcription quantitative real -time PCR (RT-qPCR) amplification. All necessary reagents for RT -qPCR are present in a stable formulation and are used to amplify specific biomarkers indicative for probability of sepsis. Detection and relative q uantification of these specific targets is achieved through 5' -exonucleolytic release of fluorophores from labeled nucleic acid probes bound to amplification targets. The fluorescence is detected by the Idylla Instrument in real time. At the end of the r oughly one -hour processing, a SeptiScore is calculated that the requestor states clearly links probability of sepsis and validity of the analytical process with a spectrum of three distinct results or 'bands' displayed on a console screen. Current Coding: The performance of gene expression assay of a blood specimen is not reported separately for inpatient hospital coding. Coding Op tions Option 1. Do not create new ICD -10-PCS codes to identify SeptiCyte\u00ae RAPID molecular analysis of a blood spec imen. Continue coding as listed in current coding. Option 2 .

Interim Coding Advice: Continue us ing current codes as listed in current c oding. 97 Single -use Intraluminal Closure System for Gastrointestinal Procedures Issue: There are currently no unique ICD -10-PCS codes to describe the use of a single -use intraluminal closure system during incisionless endoscopic gastrointestinal tract procedures. New Technology Application? No. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Approval? The original OverStitch Endoscopic Suturing System received FDA clearance on June 30, 2008 for exclusive use with a double channel therapeu tic endoscope. In 2017, the FDA approved the OverStitch SX Endoscopic Suturing System, which can be used on a variety of single channel scopes. The Apollo ESG System is under an FDA IDE clinical trial for expanded use in Endoscopic Sleeve Gastroplasty (ESG). A DeNovo 510k Application for ESG will be The OverStitch and the OverStitch SX Endoscopic Suturing Systems are disposable, single - use, mechanical end -cap catheter devices, mounted onto either a standard diagnostic endoscope or a double -channel gastroscope. They are intended for endoscopic placement of sutures and approximation of soft tissue within the gastrointestinal tract . The systems allow the endoscopist to 'reload' the suture without removing and the OverStitch SX Endoscopic Suturing Systems have been used in a variety of applications including closure of fistula, perforation or other defects , closure after surgical excision, and stent fixation. The requestor states that c urrently, the OverStitch and the OverStitch SX are the only systems that perform incisionless endoscopic surgical closure using a mechanical catheter system. This technique differs from traditional techniques , which require either a laparoscopic or an open incision for the physician to perform the surgical closure. The Apollo ESG System is a lso a disposable, single -use device, intended for endoscopic approximation of stomach tissue to reduce the volume of the stomach, resulting in sleeve gastroplasty. Unlike the OverStitch device s, used for a variety of gastrointestinal procedures , the Apollo ESG System w as designed and is seeking approval as a specific use device for Endoscopic Sleeve Gastroplasty (ESG). The Apollo ESG can be used with dual channel or single channel endoscopes . Procedure Description The OverStitch and enable incisionless endolum enal surgical closur e by allowing physicians to use hand controls, which operate the catheter system in the gastrointestinal tract , to perform a tissue anchor and cinch closure . The catheter advances the anchor , which is integral for securing and stabilizing the closure. A cinch is passed down the scope's principal channel and deployed while applying the desired amount of suture tension to secure each suture. The implanted cinch fixation devices remain permanently within the gastrointestinal tract lumen securing the tissue cl osure. The Apollo ESG utilizes a single -use Over Stitch handle and cable to perform tissue approximation using the same anchor and cinch technique described above. The Apollo ESG system effects volumetric reduction of the stomach with the anchor and cinch closure system. The significant difference between the Apollo ESG technique and the laparoscopic sleeve 98 gastrectomy (LSG) technique is that the Apollo ESG draws the intact stomach in on itself while the LSG technique partitions the stom ach into a sleeve from the outside with removal of the excluded stomach. The number of full thickness plications along the length of the stomach can range from six to eight, each with a cinch retention device. Technology According to the requestor, t he key technology that distinguishes the OverStitch , OverStitch SX, and the Apollo ESG systems is the deployment of the cinch device. The c inch device is an implant comprised of thermoplastic and stainless steel materials, and an implantable PEEK cinch component, that press -fit onto the tail end of the suture to maintain suture position in situ, and maintain the tension t o allow tissue apposition. Once deployed, the cinch lies within the gastrointestinal tract lumen indefinitely. The knotless fixation design provides fast, secure closure without the need to tie complex surgical knots. Gys et al (2019)1 performed a systematic review and meta -analysis of safety and efficacy of endoscopic gastric plication for morbid obesity. Twenty -two clinical trials with a baseline total of 2,475 patients were included in the review. Mean age at the moment of surgery was 41.2 years old (range 31.5 -47.6). Mean baseline BMI was 37.8 \u00b1 4.1 kg/m2 (range -60.2; median 37.9). Seven different techniques including transoral endoluminal stapling (or suction based), full thickness suturing and/or anchor devices were used to obta in gastric volume reduction. A meta - analysis of the OverStitch device was performed, which included eight of the clinical trials (1,721 patients) with 6 -24 month follow up. Percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) at 6 and 12 months was 57.9 \u00b1 3.8% (60.9 -75.7, I2 = 5.8). An average total of six (range 4 -9) sutures with eight (range 3 -14) \"plications\" or \"bites\" were used. S erious adverse events were described in 18 patients (1.05% of patients) : pneumothorax (n = 2), peri gastric collection (n = 8), pulmonary embolism (n = 2), intraluminal bleeding (n = 5), and leakage (n = 1). Cinch device malfunction, although infrequent, can be a challenging complication to manage2. The cinching and suture cutting involves three process es\u2014(1) locking the suture using the cinch plug, (2) engaging the suture cutter, and (3) activating the cutter and slicing the suture. When excessive suture tension is applied during cinching, the spring inside the handle of the cinch device may fracture an d malfunction and may fail to engage and activate the suture cutter. The cinch with the trapped and uncut suture cannot be removed from the endoscope channel. In such situations, the cinch handle is dismantled, and the central stiff metallic wire leading t o the cutting system is captured and pulled manually to activate it and sever the suture. To avoid encountering such technical difficulties, suture tension is slightly released just before squeezing the cinch handle. Current Coding: There are no unique IC D-10-PCS codes to identify the utilization of a single -use intraluminal closure system in gastrointestinal procedures. Report the applicable ICD -10-PCS gastrointestinal system code(s) using the approach value 8 Via Natural or Artificial Opening Endoscopic. 1 Gys, B., Plaeke, P., Lamme, B. et al.

We stated that we would consider the following during our review. o Was the procedur e code related to a new technology add -on payment application (NTAP)? o If yes, was the technology approved for the NTAP? o What is the frequency (total number of cases) of this procedure code as reported in the data for FYs 2016, 2017 and 2018? o Based on revie w of the data and the clinical aspects of each procedure code, we will propose one of the options below : 1. Leave the code in Section X (e.g. procedure codes related to the administration of a specific medication) 2. Reassign the code to the Med/Surg or other section of ICD -10-PCS and delete from Section X (e.g. NTAP has expired, data analysis and clinical review justifies incorporating this technology/procedure into the main Med/Surg section) 3. Delete the Section X code (e.g. the procedure is not reported as anticipated in the data, therefore the absence of a unique code for this technology/procedure in the classification has minimal impact) For the March 2019 ICD -10 C&M meeting we provided the findings from our initial analysi s with regard to the frequency w ith which the New Technology Group 1 codes had been reported in the data. At the September 2019 meeting we did not propose any changes to the New Technology Group 1 codes and stated we would continue to monitor the data. For the March 2020 ICD -10 C&M meeting we shared the results of our analysis for the New Technology Group 2 codes within Section X as it has been 3 years since the implementation of those codes. We provided the frequency (total number of cases) of the New Technology Group 2 procedure c odes as reported in the data for FYs 2017, 2018, and 2019. We also updated the data for the New Technology Group 1 codes to include the frequency of the codes for FY 2019. We revised the format in which we display the findings from our analyses. We crea ted an Excel spreadsheet with 2 specific tabs labeled accordingly as Group 1 Codes and Group 2 Codes. On each tab is the list of ICD -10-PCS codes, code description, frequency by fiscal year and if the technology was approved for the NTAP. At the Septembe r 2020 ICD -10 C&M meeting we review ied the updated analysis results in more detail and encourage d participants to consider the options listed above while reviewing the data for discussion. Commenters suggested adding another option for consideration. For this March 2021 ICD -10 C&M meeting we are proposing changes based on the public comments received and will also discuss a new approach to consider for future proposals. 101 1. Fourth option issue - During the September 2020 virtual meeting and expressed in comments following the meeting that were submitted by the November 9, 2020 deadline, commenters recommended CMS consider a fourth option for the Section X codes which was described as creating a unique code in another section of ICD -10-PCS and deleting the existing section X code. Upon further review and consideration of the public comments, we understand the delineation commenters were expressing and why it differs from the description provided in option 2. We agree with the recommendation and are formally proposing to add a fourth option for consideration. Example provided below. 4. Create a new code in Med/Surg or other section of ICD -10-PCS and delete the code from Section X. (e.g. NTAP has expired, data analysis and clinical review justify uniquely identifying the technology in the Med/Surg section) So, continuing with the orbita l atherectomy example, based on public comments from the September meeting, in applying this proposed option 4, for Table 02C, Extirpation of Heart and Great Vessels, we would propose to create a new qualifier value 7, Orbital Atherectomy Technique, for th e coronary artery body part values. PCS Table Example: Section X Section X New Technology Body System 2 Cardiovascular System Operation C Extirpation: Taking or cutting out solid matter from a body part Body Part Approach Device / Substance / Technology Qualifier 0 Coronary Artery, One Artery 1 Coronary Artery, Two Arteries 2 Coronary Artery, Three Arteries 3 Coronary Artery, Four or More Arteries 3 Percutaneous 6 Orbital Atherectomy Technology 1 New Technology Group 1 PCS Table Example: Med/Surg Section 0 Medical and Surgical Body System 2 Heart and Great Vessels Operation C Extirpation: Taking or cutting out solid matter from a body part Body Part Approach Device Qualifier 0 Coronary Artery, One Artery 1 Coronary Artery, Two Arteries 2 Coronary Artery, Three Arteries 3 Coronary Artery, Four or More Arteries 0 Open 3 Percutaneous 4 Percutaneous Endoscopic Z No Device 6 Bifurcation ADD 7 Orbital Atherectomy Technique Z No Qualifier 2. Guiding Principles - A commenter recommended that CMS establish guiding principles in consideration of the 4th option that was discussed at the September 2020 meeting. For example, the commenter suggested that section X codes be deleted when the technology is no longer el igible for NTAP, determine further action with regards to new 102 codes or Index entries based on the type of the technolog y (e.g. d rug versus surgical procedure), a volume threshold to help identify whether the technology has gained acceptance and/or become m ainstream medicine or standard of care, and public comments. We are requesting public comments on this recommendation and have also provide d additional details submitted by the commenter in this updated posting. Additional Details submitted by commenter for consideration with the 4th option: For drug administration procedure s, regardless of the volume of ICD -10-PCS codes reported, the commenter recommend ed the following: Delete the Section X code Delete the Alphabetic Index entry (ies) instructing users to look in Section X. Add new Alphabetic Index entry (ies) for the specific drug, referring to the general drug class or category (e.g. anti -infective) to assist users in assigning the correct value in table 3E0, Administration, Physiological Systems and An atomical Regions, Introduction, if they are interested in continuing to report these optional codes. Add the drug name (brand name and generic name) to the Substance Key with the appropriate substance/qualifier value in table 3E0 For surgical procedures w ith high volume (threshold to be determined) , the commenter recommend ed the following: Delete the Section X code. Consider creating unique values in the appropriate section (e.g. Medical Surgical) and in the corresponding root operation as the Section X code, to allow identification and tracking of the technology. Creating new codes should not require a new code request from the public. For surgical procedures with low volume, the commenter recommend ed the following: Delet e the Section X code. Delete the Alphabetic Index entry (ies) instructing users to look in Section X. Create Alphabetic Index entry (ies) directing users to the appropriate existing PCS t able or root operation. No new code would be created. Allow interested parties to submit requests to create unique values to uniquely identify the technology outside of section X . 3. Format of data - During the September meeting CMS also requested feedback on the format and content of the data analysis presented for the Section X codes. We received very few comments but those that did comment expressed support. We also received a recommendation to add another column to the far right to identify the CMS recommendation for each code using the existing options 1 -3, and if finaliz ed, the addition of the option 4. We are proposing to add this column as the commenter suggested. 4. Notification to Original Requestors - Concerns were expressed regarding how requestors may be notified that the Section X code(s) finalized at the time of their request would one day be considered e ligible for deletion once the 3 -year timeframe had passed. During the September meeting we noted that there is currently not a set or standard communication 103 process; however, we could consider adding information to clarify from the beginning that the Section X codes were intended to be temporary codes and explain the options that the Section X code(s) would be subject to. We are proposing to include this information in our communications with requestors starting with the September 2021 meeting. 5. Public Comments - As discussed during the September meeting, we stated we were providing a couple of examples to illustrate our proposed actions for the Section X New Technology Group 1 codes, based on the existing option s 1-3. We also stated that the purpose of the discussion was more of an informational, informal dialogue because this is the first time we were actually proposing to delete any of the Section X codes and we were seeking input and feedback for the process. While we continue to move forward with specific proposals and requesting public comments based on the discussions to date, we also wanted participants to consider a new or different approach for future proposals related to Section X codes in response to public comments we received. Commenters noted that the frequency of the data CMS shares is helpful; however, it should not be a driving factor in determining whether or not a Section X code should be deleted , since the CMS data is limited specifically to the Medicare population and may not fully represent other patient populations utilizing the technology or product. The commenters stated that data collection for clinical outcomes research and tracking for certain technologies warrants maintaining certain Section X codes and the indication for which the technology is utilized should also be factored in the proposals and decisions. We agree with those comments and therefore, similar to standard code proposals, including Addenda items, we believe that futur e proposals pertaining to Section X codes should be submitted by the public. This approach would continue to include the current data according to fiscal year, by the frequency in which they've been reported in the Medicare claims data, and whether or no t the procedure or product described by the code was approved as a technology with respect to the NTAP policy. However, we believe that it would be beneficial to have requests submitted by the public since those additional factors raised by the commenters could also be considered further. We are seeking input on this alternative approach for future Section X proposals. 6. Root operation definition - We received comments recommending that CMS consider broadening the definition of the root operation Assistance. The commenters noted that some procedures now being captured in ICD -10-PCS, such as embolic protection, do not fall neatly into the existing root operation or another root operation. The commenter stated that some embolic protection systems, including the Sentinel\u00ae device, are not extracorporeal, and since embolic protection devices perform a filtration function, they do not clearly \"take over a portion of a physiological function.\" To accommodate these and other future \"assistance\" procedures, the commenters suggested a broader definition such as \"Taking over a portion of, or providing intraoperative support for, a physiological function\" would be useful . As a result of these comments, we are tabling the proposal for the Embolic Protection Codes until we can review public comments for this suggested root operation revision and consider this recommendation further. We did receive several comme nts in support of creating new codes for Embolic Protection in Table 5A0, and some commenters got very creative in offering up additional options so we are sharing those in more detail in this updated posting. 104 Additional Details A. Some commenters support ed Option 2 from the September 2020 meeting as outlined below Option 2. Create a new code in table 5A0, Extracorporeal or Systemic Assistance and Performance, to identify when intraoperative embolic protection is performed during a procedure. Section 5 Extracorporeal or Systemic Assistance and Performance Body System A Physiological Systems Operation 0 Assistance: Taking over a portion of a physiological function by extracorporeal means Body System Duration Function Qualifier 5 Circulatory ADD A Intraoperative ADD 0 Filtration Z No Qualifier However, commenters also recommended that if this option were to be finalized, CMS should delete the two codes in section X table X2A that may currently be reported to identify cerebral embolic protection w as performed : X2A5312 Cerebral embolic filtration, dual filter in innominate artery and left common carotid artery, percutaneous approach, new technology group 2, (created for cerebral embolic protection using the SENTINEL Cerebral Protection System) X2A6325 Cerebral embolic filtration, single deflection filter in aortic arch, percutaneous approach, new technology group 5, (created to describe cerebral embolic protection using the TriGUARD 3 Cerebral Embolic Protection Device) Commenters also stated that since intraoperative embolic filtration would be performed in conjunction with another procedure, the definitive surgical procedure would be able to identify the site. B. Other commenters supported Option 3 from the September 2020 meeting as outlined below Option 3. Create new codes in table 5A0, Extracorporeal or Systemic Assistance and Performance, to identify when intraoperative embolic protection is performed during cerebral or peripheral artery procedures. Section 5 Extracorporeal or Systemic As sistance and Performance Body System A Physiological Systems Operation 0 Assistance: Taking over a portion of a physiological function by extracorporeal means Body System Duration Function Qualifier 5 Circulatory ADD A Intraoperative ADD 0 Filtration ADD E Head and Neck Arteries ADD J Extremity Arteries Z No Qualifier Similar to other comments submitted for option 2, the recommendation is to delete section X table X2A, incorporate all three codes from section X table X2A to table 5A0 and have the function values match the current names in the section X table X2A, such as: 105 Character 4 - 5, Circulatory Character 5 - A, Intraoperative Character 6 - 0, Filtration ? Filtration, Dual Filter ? Filtration, Single D eflection Filter ? Filtration, Extracorporeal Flow Reversal Circuit Character 7 - E, Head and Neck Arteries J, Extremity Arteries Two new rows would be needed, one for the existing filt ers and the qualifier value of E, Head and Neck Arteries, and one for 0, Filtration a nd both qualifiers of E and J. According to the commenters, b y keeping the existing names, the specific body part(s) are then known because each of these filters is used i n their specific location in the body. If the generic value of 0, Filtration is used, the arteries would be captured in the qualifier value. C. Another commenter recommended a modified Option 3, to capture options for intravascular filtration, and extracorp oreal filtration, to identify the location of the two types of filters. The commenter stated that if the function value Filtration, is modified to identify the location of the filter, CMS should adjust the numbering scheme , as 0-Filtration is used with respiratory procedures in table 5A0 . Section 5 Extracorporeal or Systemic Assistance and Performance Body System A Physiological Systems Operation 0 Assistance: Taking over a portion of a physiological function by extracorporeal means Body System Duration Function Qualifier 5 Circulatory ADD A Intraoperative ADD 6 Filtration , intravascular ADD 7 Filtration, extracorporeal ADD E Head and Neck Arteries ADD J Extremity Arteries Z No Qualifier We will provide additional updates at the September 2021 meeting for the topics where we requested consideration versus an actual proposal.

New Technology Application? Yes. The requestor has submitted a New Technology Add -on Paym ent (NTAP) application for FY 2022 consideration. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) Approval? The aprevo Intervertebral Body Fusion Device was granted FDA Breakthrough Device Designation on July 1, 2020 and 510 (k) market clearance on December 8, 2020 . Background: Spinal deformities are conditions affecting the curve or rotation of the spinal vertebrae and may occur as a result of birth defects, degeneration, or trauma. Examples of spinal deformities include scoliosis (spine curves to the right or left) , kyphosis (upper spine curves forward), and lordosis ( lower back curves inward (swayback)) . Surgical realignment of the spine involves the use of permanent intervertebral body fusion (IBF) devices to stabilize the spine and facilitate fusion. According to the requestor, u nlike traditional IBF devices, the aprevo devices are personalized to incorporate patient -specific features to allow the surgeon to tailor the deformity correction to the individual needs of the patient. The personalized featu res include height, width, depth, front - to-back angulation, side -to-side angulation, and an anatomical interface to provide a more precise fit against the anatomy of the patient's vertebral endplates. The requestor stated that achieving the specific alignm ent goals for each patient has been shown to improve outcomes, reduce complications, and contribute to greater patient satisfaction. Technology and Procedure There are four basic steps involved in the creation of a personalized intervertebral body fusion device. 1. Using the patient's own computed tomography (CT) scan, create a 3D model of the deformity 2. Plan surgical correction by using the 3D models 3. After appro val of proposed correction plan by surgeon , implants are designe d to specifically match the requirements of the plan 4. Manufacture personalized implants from 3D printed titanium The implantation method is similar to pre -fabricated IBF devices, however, the trial-and-error fit process to select the closest possible size and fit for the patient's anatomical needs is eliminated. The surgical technique may be anterior, lateral, or transforaminal/posterior. A discectomy is performed and endplate cartilage is re moved. The endplate preparation must facilitate vascular supply to the bone graft while also maintaining the integrity of the endplate. Distractors may be used to distract the vertebral segments to restore disc height , open the neural foramen, an d allow delivery of the implant. Three aprevo implants are provided for each level: a nominal size, which matches the surgical plan requirements; a size that is 1mm smaller in superior/inferior height; and a size that is 2mm larger in superior/inferior he ight. The smallest device is attached to the inserter, packed with bone graft and seated into position. If additional height is desired, the nominal or large 117 size is used. Once an implant has been placed, anterior/posterior ( A/P) and lateral fluoroscopy is used to confirm that the final position is appropriate. The requestor noted s upplemental fixation, such as posterior pedicle screws with rods should be used. Hyperlordotic anterior IBF devices (20\u00b0 lordosis) must be used with at least anterior supplemen tal fixation. Current Coding: There are no unique ICD -10-PCS codes to describe the use of a patient specific intervertebral body fusion device. Facilities can report the use of interbody fusion devices for spinal fusion using the appropriate body part v alue in tables 0RG, Fusion of Upper Joints, and 0SG, Fusion of Lower Joints, as listed below.
