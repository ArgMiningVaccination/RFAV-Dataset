Phytochemical compo u nds such as ellag ic acid, quercetin, i soferulic acid, g ipetali a nd m any others were isolated from Acacia sie ber i ana. Previou s pharm acological in vestigatio ns have reported that the pl ant has a ntica ncer, a ntim icrobi al, ant idiarrhoeal ano somal effects.

Hence, th is work i nte nds to i nvestigate the s u b-ac ute toxicity ef fects of Acacia sieb eria na root bark extract (A S E). The phytochemical and oral median leth al dose (LD 50 ) evaluat ions on the A S E were do ne i n li ne with the sta ndard protocols. The sub- acute tox ic effects of the AS E (250, 750, a nd 1,500 mg/kg) were investig ated following adm in istrat ion o f the ASE da ily for 28-consecut ive days b ased on the Orga ni zat ion of E conomic Cooperatio n a nd Development (OE CD) 4 07 protocols i n rats . The weekly body weigh ts were mon itored and the rats were eutha ni zed on the 29 th day. The blood sa mples from the an imals liver, lu ng nd heart were removed for histological i nvestigat ions.

Scientific invest ig atio ns on herbal products 12 have motivated the discovery of novel, potent a nd effective b ioacti ve agents to treat diseases 13 (Usma n et al., 2021).

However, this general belief co uld be mislead ing 17 as previous scient if ic studies have reporte d that many medicin al pla nts could produce various 18 adverse effects incl udin g death ( B ernstein et achou ay et al., 2020; Kharcho ufa et 19 al., 2018; M ou na nga et al., 2015).

The ALT, AST, and ALP are liver biomarkers 335 that determine the liver metabol i c activities ( El K ab bao ui et al., 2017) a nd are cons idered to 336 investig ate a nd m an age liver diso rders (Kim et al., 2012; Villela- n ogueira et al., 2005). The 337 plasma levels of these hepatic enzy mes elevate as a result of ce ll membrane permeab ility 338 alteration s (Li et al., 2019). On the contrary, their decline shows chronic renal disorder, 339 worsening l iver disease (Cavalca n ti et al., 2012). Besides, the ALP i s vital to diag nose b ili ary 340 duct diseases (El Ka bb ao ui et al., 2017; Ray et al., 2017). The moderate increase in ALP, with 341 little or no i ncrease in ALT and AST s uggests prim ary b iliary c irrhosis or prim ary sclerosing 342 cholangit is ( Hall & C ash, 20 12). Therefore, the dose-dep endent elevation of the ALP a nd the 343 normal ALT a nd AST levels in the current work reveal that the ASE co uld cause b ili ary 344 cirrhosis disease.
