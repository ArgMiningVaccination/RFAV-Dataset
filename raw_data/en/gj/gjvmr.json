Unity's History of Healing", "sitename": "Unity on Greenville", "date": "2013-10-23", "cleaned_text": "What Is Sacred Healing Meditation? Unity's History of Healing Unity came into being because of Myrtle Fillmore's successful spiritual healing of herself with her prayer associates. It was Charles Fillmore's curiosity about the cause of her successful spiritual healing which led him to research major religious traditions of the world resulting in his and Myrtle's formulation of the teachings of Unity. In those early days of Unity (late 1800's), the primary focus of Myrtle's healing circles was on the physical and psychological healing of those who came to her after hearing of her success. Through the 120-plus years since its founding, Unity has continued its healing tradition through prayer circles and other informal programs presented by each ministry's spiritual leader. Most of these approaches have been based upon the principle that healing occurs first in consciousness, then in the physical form. Sacred healing facilitators here continue that healing tradition today. Through the research of two medical doctors, Dr. Brugh Joy and Dr. Richard Moss, and the integration of Unity's spiritual principles by Rev. R. Scott Sherman, a contemporary of energetic healing, has been developed, that more deeply embeds the healing tradition in Unity. Our Sacred Healing facilitators have been certified in this process and are eager to serve you. Hundreds of individuals have experienced healing of physical, mental, financial and relationship issues immediately or soon afterward. The Sacred Healing Practice The key principle of Unity's Sacred Healing practice is that each of us was born to be healthy. Our \"dis-ease\" or other life issues come from restrictions in the free flow of our life energy. Freely flowing energy can be enhanced by the facilitator's \"connecting\" with the 12 key energy points on the body (see diagram. As the facilitator settles into the consciousness that sees you as completely healed and holding you in unconditional love and high regard (done in the opening minutes of the sacred healing practice), the facilitator, with your permission, will lightly and progressively touch these 12 points and any other areas you request to receive special attention for healing and balancing. You may request that the session is performed without touching. She/he will continue holding you in unconditional love, seeing you just as you were created - healed, balanced and whole. Upon completion of the progression through the energy points, she/he will then rest in meditation and silent prayer with you for a few minutes before beginning the \"regression\" through the 12 energy points - all the while holding you in a loving consciousness. The process takes about 40 minutes. You will be lying on your back, fully clothed on a comfortable massage table the entire time surrounded by beautiful music and prayer specifically created for this experience. Please feel free to ask the facilitator any question questions you may have about Sacred Healing Meditation. The facilitator's intention is that you feel safe, loved and open to the healing activity of God, the only Source of healing. If you have any concerns, it helps you open to the healing process to express those concerns. What Others Are Saying \"It is the most loving and gentle experience I know, and has helped hundreds to be healed from physical, emotional, financial and relationship issues,\" says Rev.
