This is the logical fulfillment of the ethical commitment of all health care workers to put patients as well as residents of long -term care facilities first and take all steps necessary to ensure their health and well -being. Because of highly contagious variants, inc luding the Delta variant, and significant numbers of unvaccinated people, COVID -19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths are once again rising throughout the United States.1 Vaccination is the primary way to put the pandemic behind us and avoid the return of stringent public health measures. Unfortunately, many health care and long -term care personnel remain unvaccinated. As we move towards full FDA approval of the currently available vaccines, all health care workers should get vaccinated for their own heal th, and to protect their colleagues, families, residents of long -term care facilities and patients. This is especially necessary to protect those who are vulnerable, including unvaccinated children and the immunocompromised. Indeed, this is why many healt h care and long - term care organizations already require vaccinations for influenza, hepatitis B, and pertussis. We call for all health care and long -term care employers to require their employees to be vaccinated against COVID -19. We stand with the gro wing number of experts and institutions that support the requirement for universal vaccination of health workers.2,3 While we recognize some workers cannot be vaccinated because of identified medical reasons and should be exempted from a mandate, they cons titute a small minority of all workers. Employers should consider any applicable state laws on a case -by-case basis. Existing COVID -19 vaccine mandates have proven effective.4,5 Simultaneously, we recognize the historical mistrust of health care institut ions, including among many in our own health care workforce. We must continue to address workers' concerns, engage with marginalized populations, and work with trusted messengers to improve vaccine acceptance. As the health care community leads the way i n requiring vaccines for our employees, we hope all other employers across the country will follow our lead and implement effective policies to encourage vaccination. The health and safety of U.S. workers, families, communities, and the nation depends on it.
