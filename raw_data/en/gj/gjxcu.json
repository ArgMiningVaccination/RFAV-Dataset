Miscarriage typically occurs in about 11-16% of pregnancies, and this study found miscarriage rates after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine were around 13%, similar to the expected rate of miscarriage in the general population. Previously, data from [three safety monitoring systems](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/monitoring-pregnant-people.html) did not find any safety concerns for pregnant people who were vaccinated late in pregnancy or for their babies. Combined, these data and the known severe risks of COVID-19 during pregnancy demonstrate that the benefits of receiving a COVID-19 vaccine for pregnant people outweigh any known or potential risks. Clinicians have seen the number of pregnant people infected with COVID-19 rise in the past several weeks. The increased circulation of the highly contagious [Delta variant](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/delta-variant.html), the [low vaccine uptake among pregnant people](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations-pregnant-women), and the increased risk of severe illness and pregnancy complications related to COVID-19 infection among pregnant people make vaccination for this population more urgent than ever. ### [U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES](http://www.hhs.gov/) CDC works 24/7 protecting America's health, safety and security.
