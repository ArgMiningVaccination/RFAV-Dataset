Several members of the Joint Commission of the Swiss Medical Schools (SMIFK/CIMS), a body reuniting representatives of all Swiss Faculties of medicine and of the federal authorities involved in medical teaching and training, participated in this federal committee, in particular Prof Ralph Bloch, Prof Vinzenz Im Hof, Prof Jean- Pierre Wauters, Dr Ren\u00e9 Salzberg, Dr Ueli Gr\u00fcninger and myself. As the old law and its ordinances, which prescribed in details the examinations and their contents, had hin - dered new pedagogical developments, we strongly pleaded for a new law that would give the autonomy to each medical school in the organization of its medical curriculum and in the continuous adaptation of it by taking advantage of the progress in the field of medical education. To counterbalance this autonomy, the committee proposed that the law and its ordinance should provide the federal administration in charge of public health with three powerful tools for controlling the quality of undergraduate medical education, namely: Compulsory accreditation of the medical schools1. Control of the final product by a comprehensive federal examination which would 2. examine whether the candidates master the knowledge, skills and attitudes as well as the social competencies and behaviors required for practicing the chosen medical profession, thereby enabling them to enter any of the postgraduate medi - cal training programs. Enforcement of a common Swiss catalogue of learning objectives listing know - 3. ledge, professional attitudes and clinical skills for each of the five medical profes - sions, thereby contributing to the harmonization of the curricula of the five medical schools. This was taken into account by the federal committee and eventually resulted in the Federal Act of 23 June 2006 on University Medical Professions (including also chi - ropractic). The law was enacted in September 2007, giving the medical schools the desired autonomy at the undergraduate level. Made aware of what was going on by its representatives in the federal Committee, the SMIFK/CIMS decided in 2000 to establish a Swiss Catalogue of Learning Objectives for Undergraduate Medical Training (SCLO), which was adapted from the Dutch Blue - print and published in 2001. In addition, in 2003, the SMIFK/CIMS, in collaboration with the Center of Accreditation and Quality Assurance of the Swiss Universities (OAQ) set up the criteria for accreditation of the Swiss medical schools on the basis of the criteria of the World Federation for Medical Education. Also, in 2004, it was decided to proceed with a complete revision of the SCLO, which led to the present version, approved by the SMIFK/CIMS in 2008 and which will be used as a basis for the preparation of the first new federal examination in the summer of 2011.Preface 2 Swiss Catalogue of Learning Objectives for Undergraduate Medical Training, 2nd Edition (2008)I would like to express my profound gratitude to all the members of the working group of the SCLO for their dedication to the task during all these years. My special thanks go to Prof Hans B\u00fcrgi, the chairman of the working group, for his very efficient leader - ship of the group and for his diplomatic skills and patience when he had to discuss the modifications of the new version of the SCLO with the various panels of experts of the medical specialties. Special thanks also to Dr Bernhard Rindlisbacher, the executive secretary, for his crucial work in the preparation of the working sessions of the group and the reformulation of the general objectives of the catalogue. I thank also Dr Jean- Paul Humair, who accepted to replace me in the working group as of September 2007, despite his many clinical and teaching responsibilities in Geneva. I would like to conclude with a special thought for Prof Vinzenz Im Hof, a member of the group, who died unexpectedly on the 13th of September 2006. In addition to his in - fluence in the federal Committee on the new law, he has been a constant inspiration to those of us who participated in the major changes in the medical curriculum that have taken place in all Swiss medical schools since 1995, including the implementation of the Bologna process. Professor Charles Bader, MD, chairman of the Joint Commission of the Swiss Medical Schools. Geneva, June 2008.Swiss Catalogue of Learning Objectives for Undergraduate Medical Training, 2nd Edition (2008)Swiss Catalogue of Learning Objectives for Undergraduate Medical Training, 2nd Edition (2008)Chapter 1 Introduction Swiss Catalogue of Learning Objectives for Undergraduate Medical Training, 2nd Edition (2008)Swiss Catalogue of Learning Objectives for Undergraduate Medical Training, 2nd Edition (2008)1. Introduction 4 Swiss Catalogue of Learning Objectives for Undergraduate Medical Training, 2nd Edition (2008) Chapter 11. Introduction 1.1 The first edition of The Catalogue The need to establish a Swiss Catalogue of Learning Objectives for Undergraduate Medical Training (henceforth \"The Catalogue\") had arisen in the late nineteen-nineties in the course of the procedures to obtain international accreditation and mutual recog - nition of diplomas. Up until that date, there were only a few paragraphs of a federal law dating back to 1887 (since then amended only twice) to guide Swiss medical schools on the choice of learning objectives. In the year 2000 the Joint Commission of the Swiss Medical Schools (SMIFK/CIMS) therefore entrusted a working group with the task of creating a catalogue of study objectives. Taking the Dutch \"Blueprint 1994, the Training of Doctors\" as starting point, this working group developed The Catalogue and in November 2001 presented it in electronic form to the SMIFK/CIMS, which decided to: introduce The Catalogue for a trial period of two years. issue a printed version make it available on the internet engage on a revision after two years After being ratified by all five Swiss medical faculties, the SMIFK/CIMS in March 2002 declared The Catalogue as defining the contents of the final federal examination star - ting with the academic year 2003/04. To optimize its availability and to allow a flexible use e.g. by making possible searches for groups of objectives The Catalogue was published in a database format and with free access in the internet (www.smifk.ch). It was also made available in a PDF-format and in a print version. 1.2 The second edition of The Catalogue, its legal basis, and the definition of goals of undergraduate training The new Federal Act of 23 June 2006 on University Medical Professions , which has become effective in September 2007, defines the goals of undergraduate, postgra - duate and continuing education for university medical professions (articles 4, 6, 7, 8). Starting in the year 2011, a new Federal Exam at the end of the undergraduate period will ascertain that the candidates have reached the goals and objectives and are pre - pared to enter any of the approved postgraduate specialty training programs (article 14). An Ordinance on the Federal Examinations for University Medical Professions is in preparation. In addition to settling numerous details of the exam, the ordinance refers to The Catalogue as defining the scope of the examination. The new law and ordinance will be important, since they confer a solid legal foundation to The Catalogue and define the level to be reached by the undergraduate training: The Federal Exam establishes that the graduate fulfils the conditions for entering any of the requested postgraduate programs . This implies indirectly that additional training under supervision must follow the Diploma, before medicine may be practiced independently. The Catalogue will also be an essential prerequisite for the accreditati - on of the curricula of the five Swiss medical faculties. 1. Introduction 5 Swiss Catalogue of Learning Objectives for Undergraduate Medical Training, 2nd Edition (2008) Chapter 11.3 The reasons for a second edition of The Catalogue In the four years of its use The Catalogue had well served its purpose to help students, teachers, curriculum planners and examiners. However, as one may expect, experi - ence with the application of The Catalogue also uncovered weak points and provoked a number of criticisms (see section 1.4). This had been anticipated, and SMIFK/CIMS asked the Working Group in March 2002 to remain in charge to prepare a new edition in due time, taking into account the experience gained by the use of the first edition. In November 2003 SMIFK/CIMS approved of the Working Group's plan for the revision of The Catalogue. To this purpose the Working Group held more than 30 formal meetings and numerous smaller meetings between 2004 and 2008. 1.4 Changes in the second edition As for the first edition The Working Group was composed of a representative from each Swiss medical faculty, one representative from the Swiss Society of General Medicine, two representatives of the Federal Office of Public Health and one representative of the Institute of Medical Education. As outlined below, The Working Group reviewed every chapter of the first edition of The Catalogue in order to address the criticisms that had been voiced. 1.4.1. Chapter 3 (\"Profile of the Doctor\") and chapter 4 (\"General Objectives\") Criticisms arose from two sources, namely on one hand from specialists in medical ethics and on the other hand from politicians and the Federal Office of Public Health, which at that time was preparing new legislation (see above). They criticized that The Catalogue put too much weight on knowledge and skills and too little on social com - petence, attitudes, and ethical aspects. These criticisms were in large part due to the fact that users of The Catalogue tended to skip chapters 3 and 4, and to jump directly to the \"Discipline Related Objectives\" presented in tabular form. This was however furthered by the fact that the chapters 3 and 4 only made up 8 pages in total, whereas the \"Discipline Related Objectives\" constituted with 105 pages almost 70% of the who - le Catalogue. The Working Group took the criticisms seriously, and it decided to re-write the two chapters from scratch, defining the objectives in slightly more detailed and in opera - tionalized form and combining them into one chapter, the new Chapter 3: \"General Objectives\". Furthermore, SMIFK/CIMS offered two seats in the Working Group to the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health, which commissioned the Institute for Medical Education of the University of Bern to provide a text for this new chapter. 1. Introduction 6 Swiss Catalogue of Learning Objectives for Undergraduate Medical Training, 2nd Edition (2008) Chapter 1This text relies for a substantial part on the \"CanMEDS 2005 Framework\"1 and on the British \"Curriculum for the foundation years in postgraduate education and training\"2, using also other similar frameworks for Outcome-Based Medical Edu - cation such as the \"ACGME Outcome Project\"3, the Global Minimum Essenti - al of IIME and the \"Project Professionalism\"5 of ABIM. Ethical issues were included after several meetings and discussions with the \"Specia - lized Panel on Medical Ethics\" of the Swiss Academy of Medical Sciences. 1.4.2. Chapter 5 (\"Problems as Starting Points for Training\") The Working Group reviewed each of these objectives, but made only a few minor changes to this chapter. This is now Chapter 4. 1.4.3. Chapter 6 (\"Explanation of Levels and Letters of Discipline-Related Objectives\") The definitions of the levels were revised, especially the levels of the skills, and they were transferred to the new Chapter 2: \"How to use this Catalogue\" 1.4.4. Chapter 7 (\"Discipline- Related Objectives\") The listing of clinical objectives according to medical disciplines was criticized for fa - voring sectorial over integrated clinical reasoning. The Working Group conceded that grouping of objectives according to bodily regions or according to signs and symp-toms might foster integrated thinking. However, university hospitals are still organized according to traditional disciplines, and the Working Group reasoned that a different classification would render the organization of teaching more difficult; the classification according to traditional disciplines was therefore left as it was. These lists of \"Clinical Pictures\" and \"Further Knowledge\" now constitute the new Chapter 6. Another criticism was that the Discipline- Related Objectives were too numerous. Clinical Pictures All the Clinical Pictures were reviewed with the aim to reduce their number. The Wor - king Group achieved this in the following way: It submitted each Clinical Picture to six experienced physicians, two general practitioners (representing the faculty of the sections for general practice of the 5 Medical Faculties), two general surgeons and two general internists (heads of medium-sized teaching hospitals). These six physicians were asked to rate each Clinical Picture on a scale of 1 to 4 as to prevalence (or incidence) and criticality, high criticality meaning that a disease may be rare, but knowledge about it could be life saving. The average score of the six raters was calculated for every Clinical Picture. Clinical Pictures with a low ranking of both prevalence and criticality were deleted if a Specialty Panel of five university specialists in the corresponding discipline agreed (see section 1.7., list of specialty panel heads). 1 Frank, JR.

Introduction 7 Swiss Catalogue of Learning Objectives for Undergraduate Medical Training, 2nd Edition (2008) Chapter 1If the panel disagreed with the deletion, the objective was left in place in most instances In few instances new Clinical Pictures were added and obsolete nomenclature was corrected. As a result of this approach the number of Clinical Pictures decreased from 1540 to 1330 (including quite a few Clinical Pictures mentioned twice or more times, in different disciplines, as before). Without these duplicates the total number of Clinical Pictures is now 1220. Skills All Skills were reviewed, regrouped, standardized and amended and then submitted to the responsible persons for teaching of skills in the five faculties. The Working Group made in particular the following changes: All skills which have to be actively performed by the student, thus corresponding to the earlier levels 3 and 4, e.g. history taking, physical examination, were grouped together in one single list and put into a new separate Chapter 5: \"General Skills\" . Consequently only two (instead of four) performance levels were defined. Skills with the former level 1 or 2 (\"only theory\" / \"seen or have had demonst gastro- duodenoscopy, were relocated under \"Further Knowledge\", since they implied no \"hands-on\" experience by the student. These measures reduced the number of skills from 600 to 350 (all levels) or from 280 to 170 (former levels 3 and 4). Further Knowledge Radiology and Nuclear Medicine: The Working Group felt that the learning objectives covering general aspects of radiology, such as principles of imaging techniques, radio - protection, radiotherapy, should remain in The Catalogue, but that specific radiological pictures could be deleted, because they were part of the \"Clinical Pictures\", analogous to data from clinical chemistry, pathology and microbiology. Pharmacotherapy: The first edition of The Catalogue listed as objectives knowledge of individual drugs, as well as of principles of pharmacotherapy (pharmacokinetics etc.) Analogous to radiology, the Working Group considered individual drugs as being part of clinical pictures. The new version only contains general principles of pharmacothe - rapy. The number of items under \"Further Knowledge\" was so reduced from 590 in the first edition (even with the addition of the former skills on level 1 and 2) to 460 in total and 430 without duplicates. Reduction of number of items The total number of items under Skills, Clinical Pictures and Further Knowledge was reduced from 2730 to 1960 (including duplicates), a reduction by 30%. Without duplicates the total number Pictures\" (1220) (430) now adds up to 1820. Alphabetical index The print version of the first edition of the catalogue contained an Alphabetical Index. The Working Group decided to do without it, since The Catalogue will be used in its PDF version or as a database, which allows for easy searching of any terms.1. Introduction 8 Swiss Catalogue of Learning Objectives for Undergraduate Medical Training, 2nd Edition (2008) Chapter 11.5 Outlook The chairman of the Working Group feels that the preparation of the second edition was more time consuming than that of the first edition. The requested reduction of the number of objectives, especially the \"Clinical Pictures\", was particularly cumberso - me, since criteria for deletion of objectives had to be defined. The rating of criticality and incidence finally was chosen as the most useful method. But despite this rating, some specialists objected strongly to any deletion in their specialty. Many specialists erroneously placed postgraduate objectives at the undergraduate level, ignoring that many objectives can and should be taught during postgraduate training, which in most specialties lasts almost as long or in some specialties even much longer than under - graduate training. Even with a reduced load of objectives in the present catalogue, the knowledge and skills required from students remains enormous. It is the responsibility of the teachers and faculties that goals are set high, but not unrealistically so. Teachers in medicine should keep in mind that even such simple procedures as palpating the pedal pulses or eliciting an ankle reflex cannot be mastered within a few minutes. 1.6 Composition of the Working Group During the work on the second edition of The Catalogue several members of the Wor - king Group were exchanged. Two representatives from the Federal Office of Public Health joined the group. Chairman H.

Introduction 10 Swiss Catalogue of Learning Objectives for Undergraduate Medical Training, 2nd Edition (2008) Chapter 11.8 Acknowledgements The first edition of The Catalogue relied heavily on the Dutch \"Training of Doctors, Blue - print 1994\", for which our Dutch Colleagues had waived the copyright in our favor. Much of this material is still used in our second edition. The Working Group again wishes to thank the authors of the Dutch Blueprint to let us rely on their pioneering work. For the formulation of the \"General Objectives\" we relied mainly on the \"CanMEDS 2005 Framework\" and on the British \"Curriculum for the foundation years in postgraduate education and training\". We are grateful to the authors of these outstanding lists of com - petencies that we were able to use their work. The Working Group is extremely grateful that members from the Institute of Medical Education of the University of Bern (R. Bloch, P. Schl\u00e4ppi, B. Rindlisbacher) took over the onerous task to prepare the Power Point or Excel-Table projections for the meetings of the Working Group and to keep the electronic records of the changes that had been decided upon. Mrs. S. Antonopoulos from the Institute of Medical Education succeeded Mrs. E. Wal - ser for organizing the Working Group's meetings and taking over the secretarial duties. Without this logistical support, The Catalogue could not have been finished in time. The final layout of The Catalogue was designed by B\u00e9atrice Boog from the Institute of Me - dical Education.Swiss Catalogue of Learning Objectives for Undergraduate Medical Training, 2nd Edition (2008)Swiss Catalogue of Learning Objectives for Undergraduate Medical Training, 2nd Edition (2008)Chapter 2 How to use this Catalogue Swiss Catalogue of Learning Objectives for Undergraduate Medical Training, 2nd Edition (2008)Swiss Catalogue of Learning Objectives for Undergraduate Medical Training, 2nd Edition (2008)2 How to use this Catalogue 12 Swiss Catalogue of Learning Objectives for Undergraduate Medical Training, 2nd Edition (2008) Chapter 22. How to use this Catalogue 2.1 Structure of The Catalogue The purpose of this Catalogue of Learning Objectives is to help students to know what they are expected to learn during their undergraduate edu - cation, and to give them a framework for the final exam; teachers to focus on these objectives, curriculum planners to make sure that all the important content is covered in the curriculum, and examiners to decide whether the mastering of a specific assessment-task can be expected from the graduating student. The following chapters constitute the core of this Catalogue of Learning Objectives: Chapter 3: General Objectives Chapter 4: Problems as Starting Points for Training Chapter 5: General Skills Chapter 6: Discipline- Related Objectives It is important to bear in mind that only the chapter \"General Objectives\" co - vers the whole scope of undergraduate medical training; thus this chapter is the backbone and most important part of The Catalogue, while Chapters 4 - 6 are on a lower hierarchical level, focusing on specific but impor - tant parts of the competencies expected from a physician at the end of her/his under - graduate training.2 How to use this Catalogue 13 Swiss Catalogue of Learning Objectives for Undergraduate Medical Training, 2nd Edition (2008) Chapter 22.2 Definition of Problems, Levels and Letters In the Chapters 4-6 the content is listed as key points (e.g. Clinical Pictures) or short sentences. To make clear to what extent a General Skill, a certain Clinical Picture or Further Knowledge should be mastered; there are specifications by Levels and Let - ters. The different kinds of objectives and the Levels and Letters are defined as follows: Definition of Problems Problems as Starting Points for TrainingHere, a problem is defined as a symptom, sign or test result of a pa - tient with which the physician may be confronted. The physician is able to assess a patient presenting this problem in a well structured way, and to establish a differential diagnosis. She/he is able to propose appropriate diagnostic, therapeutic, social, preven - tive and other measures, and to provide urgent intervention in case of a life-threatening problem. Problems were selected if they occur frequently even though rare, rapid and appropriate intervention may be life- saving or non-intervention might be harmfulE they are a cause of excessive emotional distress for the patient E Problems which are life-threatening and require urgent intervention are marked with an upper case E.2 How to use this Catalogue 14 Swiss Catalogue of Learning Objectives for Undergraduate Medical Training, 2nd Edition (2008) Chapter 2Definition of Levels General SkillsLevel 1 Level 2 Some practical experience: The physician is able to explain the skill (principle, indication, con - traindication, burden, possible complications, getting informed consent, documentation) and has performed the skill several times under supervision (if necessary with simulator).Routine: The physician is able to explain the skill (principle, indication, contraindication, burden, possible complications, getting informed consent, documentation). She/he has acquired enough routine to perform the skill correctly without supervision. The skill must be mastered in all age groups of patients, from chil - dren to elderly people (but not in newborn and infants) Clinical PicturesBe able to recognize the possible relevance: If appropriate, the physician con - siders this clinical picture as a possible diagnosis. She/he can define this clinical picture in broad terms without knowing details.Be able to cope with in practice: The physician is able to take a history and perform a physical examination in a structured way. She/he is able to consider the clinical picture as a diagnosis and recognizes and actively searches for the typical complaints and signs. She/he proposes appro - priate diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities to her/his supervising physician considering its epide - miology and relevant pathology (including histology, pathophysi - ology and psychodynamics). She/ he explains the diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities to the pa - tient in an appropriate way. Further KnowledgeThis indicates an overview level: The physician is capable to rough - ly define the concept or describe the procedure including indication and contraindication. She/he is able to recognize its possible relevance in a given clinical situation. She/he has seen the correct per - formance of the procedure (live, by simulator, video or other me - dia). Be able to cope with in practice: The physician is capable to use this knowledge in interpreting findings, counseling on preven - tive measures and treating the patient.2 How to use this Catalogue 15 Swiss Catalogue of Learning Objectives for Undergraduate Medical Training, 2nd Edition (2008) Chapter 2Definition of Letters D The diagnosis is made personally by means of physical examination, simple aids or additional investigation requested and interpreted by the physician herself/himself (e.g. X-ray of chest or extremities, electrocardiogram). For example the letter D does not apply for breast cancer, since its diagnosis requires taking and interpreting a biopsy, knowledge beyond a graduate in medicine. Attribution of this letter requires level 2 of competence. T Therapy must be carried out by the physician personally, referring to the most common therapy for an uncomplicated illness. Attribution of this letter requires level 2 of competence. E The physician is able to perform primary and secondary assessment of pa - tients and initiate emergency measures. The letter E may be attributed even in absence of the letter D. The physician in this case is not required to estab - lish a firm diagnosis; she/he may act on a well-founded suspicion. Example: Referral to hospital in case of suspicion of bacterial meningitis. P The physician is able to identify and initiate appropriate preventive mea - sures. G The letter G defines a particularly relevant problem for General Practice and Outpatient Medicine. As mentioned in the introduction it was decided to stick to listing the Discipline- Re - lated Objectives corresponding to traditional disciplines in university hospitals. Given the comprehensive, interdisciplinary character of General Practice it does not make sense within this structure to list the Clinical Pictures and Further Knowledge of this discipline or specialty separately. So as in the first edition the main content of this specialty is defined by the letter G linked to the Clinical Pictures and Further Know - ledge in any of the traditional disciplines in university hospital. 2 How to use this Catalogue 16 Swiss Catalogue of Learning Objectives for Undergraduate Medical Training, 2nd Edition (2008) Chapter 22.3 Code of Objectives (Objective-ID) In this second edition of The Catalogue each separate learning objective was attributed a code or \"Objective-ID \". This code consists of 3 parts: 1) One letter for G = General Objective P = Problem as Starting Point for Training S = General Skill C = Discipline- Related Objectives (Clinical Picture or Further Knowledge) 2) Two letters standing for the Role (General Objectives) or the Discipline (Clinical Pictures and Further Knowledge). Role (Chapter 3) Discipline (Chapter 6) ME Medical Expert IM Internal Medicine CM Communicator PT Pharmacotherapy CL Collaborator SU Surgery MA Manager PE Pediatrics HA Health Advocate GO Gynecology - Obstetrics SC Scholar PS Psychiatry PR Professional OP Ophthalmology DE Dermatology OT Otorhinolaryngology RN Radiology - Nuclear Medicine PH Public Health, Insurance- and Occu - pational Medicine FM Forensic Medicine 3) A number for each objective within the same Role (General Objectives), for each Problem as Starting Point for Training, for each General Skill and for each objective within the same Discipline (Discipline- Related Objectives). Examples: G CM 7 is objective number 7 within the Role of Communicator in Chapter 3, Gene - ral Objectives. C SU 259 is objective number 259 within the Discipline Surgery in Chapter 6, Discip - line- Related Objectives 2.4 Cross-Referencing All objectives which appear twice or several times within the same chapter are cross-referenced within square brackets with the code explained above. So if the Clinical Picture C SU 270 is followed by [C IM 35] this means that the same Clinical Picture can be found in Internal Medicine as objective number 35.2 How to use this Catalogue 17 Swiss Catalogue of Learning Objectives for Undergraduate Medical Training, 2nd Edition (2008)Titelseite Swiss Catalogue of Learning Objectives for Undergraduate Medical Training, 2nd Edition (2008)Chapter 3 General Objectives3 General Objectives 18 Swiss Catalogue of Learning Objectives for Undergraduate Medical Training, 2nd Edition (2008) Chapter 33. General Objectives 3.1 Introduction In the 1990s the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada (RCPSC), responsible for setting residency training, examination and accreditation standards ac-ross the country asked its \"Societal Needs Working Group\" to \"identify the core com-petencies generic to all specialists to meet the needs of society.\" The result was the CanMEDS framework. The physician \"Roles\" concept was provided by the \"Educating Future Physicians for Ontario\" Project. The framework was the result of a sophistica - ted process lasting several years and based on expert input e.g. on physician-patient communication, on consultation with other healthcare organizations, on systematic li - terature search and on input from public focus groups. The seven CanMEDS Roles or thematic groups of competencies, as defined by the framework have since obtained growing international acceptance in medical education as a well suited structure for ca-talogues of goals and objectives. So the Working Group decided to adopt these Roles to structure the General Objectives. The CanMEDS Roles and their definition are as follows 1: Medical Expert Definition: As Medical Experts, physicians integrate all of the CanMEDS Roles, ap- plying medical knowledge, clinical skills, and professional attitudes in their provision of patient-centered care. Medical Expert is the central physician Role in the CanMEDS framework. Communicator Definition: As Communicators, physicians effectively facilitate the doctor-patient rela - tionship and the dynamic exchanges that occur before, during, and after the medical encounter. Collaborator Definition: As Collaborators , physicians effectively work within a healthcare team to achieve optimal patient care. Manager Definition: As Managers, physicians are integral participants in healthcare organiza - tions, organizing sustainable practices, making decisions about allocating resources, and contributing to the effectiveness of the healthcare system. Health Advocate Definition: As Health Advocates, physicians responsibly use their expertise and in - fluence to advance the health and well-being of individual patients, communities, and populations. 1 Frank, JR.
