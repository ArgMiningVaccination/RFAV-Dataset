Author Penny C. Royal INTRODUCTION Dear Jan, It was good to receive your letter, but I'm sorry you have had so many health problems. Your letter sounded so much like mine would have sounded several years ago. Perhaps if I share my story with you, it will give you comfort and encouragement. Remember how carefree, energetic and full of life I was in college, and how I would eat anything I desired and never gain a pound? You always said, Everyone has to watch their waistline, why don't you? Well, I took that same habit with me into my career. When most of the other employees had their roll and drink, I had to have creme pies and rich pastries. They were all so envious of me. But Jan, not one of them would envy me in the least had they seen me several years ago \u2014 it all caught up with me. After receiving my immunization shots before going to Europe in 1962, I became very sick. I just assumed that everyone had the same reaction. By the time I arrived in France a month later, I was miserable and in so much pain, I literally could not carry my own purse. After three months trying to ignore and bear the pain, I had to return home, only to find that my body ws full of Rheumatoid Arthritis. This crippling disease is often brought on by stressful situations and settles in the weak areas of the body. In my case, the shots and foreign travel were more stress than my body could handle. It settled in my back, which was weak from a childhood injury. In any case, I was in pretty bad shape. This was the only time in my life I was considered fat. I had gained 50 pounds and had that puffy, blown-up look. After I returned home and received treatment from numerous doctors, and received very little encouragement, I decided I would just have to live with the pain. Since I was unable to return and teach school because of the frequent pain, and my inability to grasp a pencil or chalk, I finally got a job as a receptionist. I sat on a donut pillow with a heating pad at my back. It wasn't too bad as I fixed a fancy cover for my pillow and made a pocket in the back of my chair for the heating pad. In this manner I endured the situation while always seeking out any new doctor whom I thought might give me some relief. About a year and a half later, I met my husband and we were married. When I started out with my first pregnancy, I had a very difficult time. I got Bell's palsy, then Pneumonia, which lasted about two months. My delivery was very difficult. I didn't realize just how serious things were until I learned that the doctor slept just outside my room that first night. Also, I spent three days in the recovery room. It did seem rather strange that I had so many roommates during that time. Since the doctor wanted me to see my baby before I died, they brought her to me in the recovery room, which I learned later didn't happen too often. I had to have a blood transfusion and later realized this was when I got Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar. At that time most doctors weren't too familiar with this disease. It wasn't generally known that diet had anything to do with that particular health problem. I continued to eat the sweets my body craved which gave me a temporary pick-up and when my sugar dropped, I'd just take another goodie. Little did I realize the damage I was causing to my adrenal glands and liver. Some two years later, during my second pregnancy, I again got Pneumonia and it lasted for 5 months. I had three doctors trying to figure out why my body rejected the antibiotics. They put me in and out of the hospital, but to no avail. It was during this time that I had numerous problems with constipation and frequent pains in the colon area. The doctor diagnosed it as a nervous colon, then colitis, and finally diverticulitis. By this time, I knew things were getting pretty bad, so I made another appointment with a new clinic. At the end of six hours of testing and examinations by very competent internists, I was told that there was nothing very seriously wrong with me. I did have a slightly overactive thyroid, my blood was low, but in the normal range, I had a cyst on my ovary, but the doctor said it should be watched and possibly would go away without surgery. As for the pains in my colon, well, they wanted to do exploratory surgery and see what was going on inside. My strep throat was still a mystery. You can imagine how I felt as I left the clinic that day. It was that night I walked the floor asking my Heavenly Father for help. I was guided to a lady who believed in herbs and diet and cleansing. I thought she was something else, but since I had no other way to go, I followed her diet of raw juices. It was hard for me to suddenly give up all meat and animal products, and I didn't think I could ever exist without my sweets and pastries. I could have only fruits, vegetables, seeds and nuts. My body was so emaciated that it was very difficult to change so suddenly. I couldn't even think clearly \u2014 you know the feeling \u2014 fuzzy in the brain. I cried a lot and prayed more than I ever had. No one seemed to understand. My own family and friends ridiculed and teased me for the drastic change I had made in diet and cleansing. They knew I would be gone in a short time if I didn't get to a good doctor. Thanks to an understanding husband, I was able to endure and keep trying. This lady gave me steam baths, and salt scrubs to try and open up my pores. She even gave me enemas to try to clean out the toxins from my system. You see, I didn't realize what I was doing to my body all of those years while I was enjoying my junk food. I finally reached the point, after three months, that I "}
