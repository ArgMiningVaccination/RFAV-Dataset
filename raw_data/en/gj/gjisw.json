Introduction and How to Approach Plan Development The Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) program provides res ources to state, territory, and tribal grantees that enable lowincome parents to work or p ursue education and training so that they can better support their families while at the sam e time promoting the learning and development of their children. The CCDF program also provid es funding to enhance the quality of child care for all children. The CCDF Plan is how states a nd territories apply for CCDF fund ing (658E (a)) and is the primary mechanism that the Admin istration for Children and Fami lies (ACF) uses to determine state and territory compliance with the requirements of the law and rule (98.16). ACF acknowledges that in the FY 2022 - 2024 Plan, states and te rritories may still be operating under approved waivers related to the COVID19 pandem ic and where appropriate plan responses shoul d reflect the approved waivers. The CCDF Plan allows states and territories to describe their implementation of the CCDF pr ogram and it is organized into the following sections: 1. Define CCDF Leadership and Coordination with Relevant Systems a nd Funding Sources 2. Promote Family Engagement Through Outreach and Consumer Educati on 3. Provide Stable Child Care Fina ncial Assistance to Families 4. Ensure Equal Access to Child C are for LowIncome Children 5. Establish Standards and Monitori ng Processes to Ensure the Heal th and Safety of Child Care Settings 6. Recruit and Retain a Qualified an d Effective Child Care Workfor ce 7. Support Continuous Quality Improvement 8. Ensure Grantee Program Integrity and Accountability These organizational categories reflect key goals of an integra ted system of child care for low income working families. Al though the Plan is divided into sections for reporting and accountability purposes, ACF enc ourages Lead Agencies to approa ch the Plan in a cross cutting, integrated manner. The intention is that grantees and the federal government will be able to use this information to track and assess progress, d etermine the need for technical assistance (TA), and determine compliance with specif ic requirements. Citations ACF recognizes that Lead Agencie s use different mechanisms to e stablish policies, such as state statute, regulations, admi nistrative rules, or policy man uals or policy issuances. When asked to provide a citation in t he CCDF Plan, Lead Agencies sho uld list the citation(s) for the policy that clearly identifies and establishes the requirement and that allows the Lead Agency to enforce the requiremen t. Lead Agencies may list multi ple sources as needed to cover all types of providers rec eiving CCDF (e.g., policies for licensed providers may be established in licensing regulat ions, and policies for license exempt providers may be in subsidy rules). These citations are intended to provide documen tation to support the requested information but not replace requested responses or de scriptions. Complete answers must include citations , responses, and descriptions. CCDF Plan Submission States and territories will subm it their Plans electronically t hrough the ACF118 electronic submission site. The ACF118 site will include all language and questions included in the final CCDF Plan Preprint template approv ed by the Office of Managemen t and Budget. Please note that the format of the questions on the ACF118 site could be m odified from the Word version of the document to ensure comp liance with Section 508 policies regarding accessibility to electronic and information technology for individuals with disa bilities. (See http://www.section508.gov/ for more information.) In responding to questions, states and territories are asked to provide brief, specific summaries and/or bullet points only with specific language that responds to the question. Do not use tables or copy and paste char ts, add attachments, or paste manuals int o the Plan. All information and materials developed to support CCDF implementation and informat ion reported in the CCDF Plan are subject to review by ACF as part of ongoing oversight and m onitoring efforts. 1 Define Leadership and Coordina tion with Relevant Systems and Funding Sources This section identifies the lead ership for the CCDF program in each Lead Agency and the entities and individuals who will participate in the implementa tion of the program. It also identifies the stakeholders that were consulted to develop the Plan and who the Lead Agency collaborates with to implement se rvices. Respondents are asked to identify how match and maintenanceof effort (MOE) fu nds are used. Lead Agencies expl ain their coordination with child care resource and referral (CCR&R) systems and describe t heir efforts on their disaster preparedness and response plans to support continuity of operat ions in response to emergencies. 1.1 CCDF Leadership The Governor of a state or terri tory must designate an agency ( which may be an appropriate collaborative agency) or establish a joint interagency office t o represent the state or territory as the Lead Agency. The Lead Agency agrees to administer the pr ogram in accordance with applicable federal laws and regu lations and the provisions of t his Plan, including the assurances and certifications a ppended hereto (658D; 658E(c)(1) and 98.16 (a)).

In the description include: Written agreements. Note: The contents of the written agreement may vary based on the role the agency is asked to assume or type of project but m ust include at a minimum the elements below (98.11(a)(3)). o Tasks to be performed o Schedule for completing tasks o Budget which itemizes categorical expenditures in accordance wi th CCDF requirements o Monitoring and auditing procedures o Indicators or measures to assess performance of those agencies Any other processes to oversee and monitor other agencies. NOTE : The Office of the State Superint endent of Education (OSSE) has a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the DC Department of Human Services (D HS), which is the District's Temporary Assistan ce for Needy Families (TANF) a gency, that outlines the roles and responsibilities of DHS in determining child care eligibility. Specifically, the MOU includes s pecific tasks to be completed b y DHS and OSSE, with clear timelines and budget line items. Additionally, the M OU requires that OSSE conduct onsite reviews to de termine compliance with establ ished policies and conduct followup visits to validate compliance and provide s for scheduled and unscheduled monitoring visits. OSSE conducts quarterly audi ts/eligibility reviews of DHS. These reviews co nsists of OSSE eligibility moni tors requesting a selected sample of records for each caseworker. A transmittal f orm is prepared for the case records and the intake and assignment forms are pr inted. The eligibility monitor visits the child care services office and r eviews each record using the eligibility review che cklist, to document each eligib ility factor. These forms are given to the superviso r to complete/update any factor s that were noted for correction. During the second review, the El igibility Checklist and the Cov er Sheet are given to the supervisor and if needed, an additional five to 10 days is given for the resolution of any outstanding deficiencies. Addit ionally, OSSE's Division of Early Learning Operations and Grants Management uni t conducts annual reviews of Level II providers. Also, the CCR&R tracks ea ch contact made with families, providers and oth ers made over the phone, by ema il, on their website and in person. This info rmation is tracked in an online QuickBase application and is reviewed and analyzed on a monthly basis. . 1.2.4 Note: Upon request, and to the extent practicable and appropri ate, Lead Agencies must ensure any code or software for child care information systems or information technology for which a Lead Agency or other age ncy expends CCDF funds to devel op must be made available to other public agencies. This i ncludes public agencies in othe r states, for their use in administering child care or related programs (98.15(a)(11)). As sure by describing how the Lead Agency makes child care information systems (e.g., subsidy, reg istry, and QRIS systems) available to public agencies in other states. The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) does not expend CCDF funds to develop any code or software for child care information systems or information technology. 1.2.5 Lead Agencies must have in effect policies to govern the use an d disclosure of confidential and personally identifiable information about children and fami lies receiving CCDF assistance and child care providers receiv ing CCDF funds (98.15(b)(13)). C ertify by describing the Lead Agency's policies related to the use and disclosure of confiden tial and personally identifiable information. Note: The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) requires all employees, contractors and other personnel to maintain the secu rity and privacy of any and all data, documents and informat ion acquired by and accessed th rough OSSE. Staff are required to sign a nondisclosu re agreement asserting complianc e with these policies. The nondisclosure agreement affirm s that staff complies with confi dentiality and security of personally identifiable information pursuant to District of Col umbia laws and regulations, as well as federal laws and regulat ions and that this information is not disclosed to any unauthorized party, organization, or entity. Also , OSSE's licen sing regulations require child development facilities to confor m to applicable state and feder al laws and protect a child's confidential information, keepin g all records in a secure locat ion and not disclosing information concerning an indivi dual child or the parents/guard ians. Further, each child care provider that participates in the District's subsidized child c are program is required to sign a \"Provider Agreement\" which speci fically requires that the provi der is responsible for ensuring all children's records ar e maintained in a safe and se cure manner. Per the Provider Agreement, OSSE will hold the Provider accountable for any and all missing records by recouping the payment for the child for the time period the Pro vider could not produce the record to substantiate eligibility. 1.3 Consultation in the Development of the CCDF Plan The Lead Agency is res ponsible for developing the CCDF Plan, wh ich serves as the application for a 3year implementation period. As part of the Plan develop ment process, Lead Agencies must consult with the following: (1) Appropriate representatives of units of general purpose local g overnment\u2014 (658D(b)(2); 98.10(c); 98.12(b); 98.14(b)). General purpose loc al governments are defined by the U.S. Census at https://www.census.gov/newsroom/c span/govts/20120301_cspan_govt s_def _ 3.pdf. (2) The State Advisory Council (SAC) on Early Childhood Education a nd Care (pursuant to 642B(b)(I)(A)(i) of the Head Start Act) (658E(c)(2 )(R); 98.15(b)(1)) or similar coordinating body pursuant to 98.14(a)( 1)(vii). (3) Indian tribe(s) or tribal organization(s) within the state. Thi s consultation should be done in a timely manner and at the option of the Indian trib e(s) or tribal organization(s) (658D(b)(1)(E)). Consultation involves meeting with or otherwise obtaining input from an appr opriate agency in the development of the state or territory CCDF Plan. Describ e the partners engaged to provide services under the CCDF p rogram as described in questio n 1.4.1. 1.3.1 Describe the Lead Agency's consultation efforts in the developm ent of the CCDF Plan. Note: Lead Agencies must describe in a. - c. consultation efforts wit h required partners listed in Rule and Statute. ACF recognizes that there is great value in c onsulting with other entities and has provided element d. for Lead Agencies to identify consu ltation efforts with other agencies or organizations. a. Describe how the Lead Agency consulted with appropriate represe ntatives of general purpose local governments. The O ffice of the State Superintende nt of Education (OSSE) met with and o btained input from the Deputy Ma yor for Education (DME) during the develo pment of the Plan. Additionall y, as described below, OSSE met with and obtaine d input from the State Early Ch ildhood Development Coordinating Council (SECDCC) which includes repres entatives from the Executive Office of the Mayo r (EOM) and the Council of the District of Columbia. During these consultati ve meetings, OSSE focused on s trategies to improve the quality of and acce ss to highquality child care an d ensure equitable access to highquality care. Addi tionally, these consultations and collaborations yielded critical stakeholder feedback aimed at empowering famil ies and increasing knowledge of highquality child care and strategies to strength en the District's early care and education infrastructure . b. Describe how the Lead Agency consulted with the State Advisory Council or similar coordinating body. The Office o f the State Superintendent of E ducation (OSSE) Assistant Superintendent of Early Learning - who also serves as the Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) Administrator - facilitat ed two consultat ion sessions wi th the District of Columbia State Early Child Development C oordinating Council (SECDCC). Th e first session was held in January 2020 and included: Background on the Child Care and Development Block Grant Reauth orization Act of 2014 and the state plan requirements An overview of the purpose of each preprint section/topic Presentation and vote on the Dist rict's proposal to conduct a c ost estimation model as part of the State Plan General updates on the District's state plan development proces s During the January 2020 meeting, t he SECDCC voted to move forwa rd with requesting ACF approval to use the alternat ive cost methodology for the FY 20222024 CCDF Plan. OSSE held a second consultation s ession with the SECDCC in Marc h 2020. During this session, the Assistant Superint endent of Early Learning recappe d the background and purpose of CCDF and the threeyear state plan. The session incl uded a more indepth review of each of the eight se ctions of the CCDF preprint highl ighting the initiatives the District is currently implementing under each section. Followin g the main presentation, SECDCC members participated in tw o breakout group s to facilitat e more direct engagement on the CCDF State Pla n. The CCDF Administrator and t he CoAdministrator facilitated each of the breakou t groups and solicited input on improving the District's support for the early childhood w orkforce; enhancing partnershi ps across government agencies to increase highqualit y child care; ensuring CCDF eli gible families/parents equal access to highquality child care and what if any policie s that were changed during the coronavirus (COVID19) public health emergency should be ex tended through the state plan period. The SECDCC consultation discussion recommended r eviewing family /parent outreach and engagement practices in prep aration for the resumption of e ligibility redeterminations follo wing the conclusion of the public health emergency. At the conclusion of the breakou t groups, the full SECDCC recon vened to review the next steps and share any addition al recommendations on the Dist rict's CCDF State Plan. The group's overarching remarks centered on increasing supports for families seeking subsidized child care and additional support for the early chil dhood education workforce. In May 2021, OSSE staff will prese nt the updated District of Co lumbia Cost Estimation model to the SECDCC for review a nd feedback, and will share key themes from public comment during the public hea ring on the draft plan. c. Describe, if applicable, how the Lead Agency consulted with Ind ian tribes(s) or tribal organizations(s) withi n the state. Note: T he CCDF regulations r ecognize the need for states to conduct formal, structured co nsultation with Tribal governme nts, including Tribal leadership. Many states and trib es have consultation policies a nd procedures in place. N/A. Describe any other entities, agencies, or organizations consult ed on the development of the CCDF Plan. The Offi ce of the State Educa tion (OSSE) consulted with a number of public and private stakeholders to gather inpu t on the CCDF State Plan. These groups include the following: District's Child Care Recovery W orkgroup (a core group of early childhood education (ECE) stakeholders convened in the Spring 2020 to assist OSSE i n developing guidance, templates and other t ools to support childcare reopen ing efforts due to the coronavirus (COVID19) public health emergency, and which OSSE continues to engage for advice and input on key issues facing the District's early learning community; Program managers from communityb ased organizations (CBOs) part icipating in the PreK Enhancement and Expansion Program (a part of the District 's publicly funded prek program for 3 and 4yearold children); The Early Childhood Stakeholders Group (the broad group of lice nsed child care providers - CCDF and nonCCDF pro viders - gathering on a routin e basis to facilitate the flow of information on cha nges and guidance during the coro navirus COVID19 public health emergency ); The District of Columbia Head St art Association (DCHSA); the DC Early Learning Collaborative (DC ELC); and DC Ac tion for Children (DC Action). The DCHSA represents all Early Head Start and Head Start programs within the District of Columbia. The DC ELC is an allianc e of more than 100 education professionals, organizations, and coalitions wor king together to advocate for improved early childhood education policy, investment, and services. DC Action is an advocacy organization that works to promote public policies that support kids at every step from early childhood to early adulthood. 1.3.2 Describe the statewide or territorywide public hearing process held to provide the public with an opportunity to comment on the provision of child care s ervices under this Plan (658D(b)(1)(C); 98.16(f)). Reminder: Lead Agencies are required to hold at least one public hearing in the state or territory, with sufficient statewide or territorywide distribution of notice prior to such a hearing to enable the public to comment on the provision of child care services under the CCDF Plan. At a minimum, this description must include: a. Date of the public hearing. May 25, 2021 . Reminder: Must be no earlier than January 1, 2021, which is 9 m onths prior to the October 1, 2021, effective date o f the Plan. If more than one p ublic hearing was held, please enter one date (e.g., the date of the first hearing, the most recent hearing or any hearing date that demonstr ates this requirement). b. Date of notice of public hearing (date for the notice of public hearing identified in a. April 16, 2021. Reminder: Must be at least 20 calendar days prior to the date o f the public hearing. If more than one public hearing was held, enter one date of notice (e.g ., the date of the first notice, the most recent notice or any da te of notice that demonstrates this requirement). c. How was the public notified about the public hearing? Please in clude specific website links if used to provide notice. The Dist rict of Columbia's method for f ormal notification of public hearings is the DC Regi ster. The Notice of Public Hea ring for the Child Care and Development Fund State Plan fo r FFY 202224 and the link to the draft state plan was included in the D.C. Register on April 16, 2021 and is availabl e here https://www.dcregs.dc.gov/ . Additionally, the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) notified the Dis trict's early childhood educat ion stakeholder community through the biweekly COVID19 co nference call, the monthly con vening of the DC Child Care Recovery Working Group and distribution through OSSE's LEA Look Forward, a newsletter that reaches over 2, 296 education leaders directly. d. Hearing site or method, including how geographic regions of the state or territory were addressed. Due to the coronavirus (COVID19) public health emergency, the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) held a virtual public hearing through a webinar platform. OSSE ensured that tran slation services were available if the services were requested. The available options included Amharic, Chinese, Fre nch, Spanish, Vietnamese, Korean and American Sign Language. Additionally, OSSE met with key community groups to collect in put on the state plan and to announce the public hearing. e. How the content of the Plan was made available to the public in advance of the public hearing. (e.g., the Plan was made available in other lan guages, in multiple formats, etc.) The draft plan was made available through the Office of the Sta te Superintendent of Education's (OSSE's) website on M onday , May 3, 2021 as announc ed in the Notice of Public Hearing (NOPH).

Official Code \u00a7 38 282.01) (\"HTA\"), the Provider shall participate in the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CAC FP), if at least 50 percent of enrolled children are eligible to receive subsidized child care for at least six continuous months\". Teams from both units meet regularly to audit complian ce with the program requirements, prepare joint communications and conduct joint ou treach and education to meet the above states goal. Since the passage of the Healthy Tots Act, OSSE has refined an effective and systematic approach for working with child development facilities that are required to participate in CACFP. When a child development facility has been identified as meeting the Healthy Tots Act requirements to participate in CACFP, OSSE contacts the fac ility to encourage them to participate in CACFP. OSSE also makes the facility aware of th e option to apply for a participation waiver. OSSE follo ws up by scheduling an inperso n technical assistance visit with the facility to provide facetoface assistance with Healt hy Tots Act and CACFP compliance. Facilities that decide to apply for CACFP receive t raining and reoccurring technical assistance from OSSE throughout the entire applicatio n process.

Our shared goal is to ensu re the health and safety of all children and staff in the event of an emergency or disas ter and to support reunification and recovery as quickly as possible. As the Dis trict entered the reopening phases during the coronavirus (C OVID19) public health emergenc y, OSSE also partnered with HSEMA and child care provid ers to support safe reopening a nd operations of child care. Through this partnershi p, OSSE distributed over 898,000 pieces of PPE to all licensed child care provid ers who wanted them. b. The following are examples of opt ional partners a state might c oordinate with to provide services. Check which optional partners the Lead Agency coordin ates with and describe the coordination goals, processes and results. i. State/territory/local agencies with Early Head Start - Child Care Partnership grants. Describe: The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) leveraged the Ea rly Head StartChild Care Part nership (EHSCCP) grant to develop the Quality Improvement Network (QIN ), which aims to build capacity, i ncrease access to and enhance th e quality of care of infants and toddlers. The QIN brings EHS services su ch as family engagement, coaching and technica l assistance, mental health an d child health services to children and families who are living below t he federal poverty line in child development centers throughout the Distri ct. The federallyfunded QIN is currently implemented through one hub, the United Planning Organization (UP O). Currently, UPO supports a n etwork of 16 child development centers. The QIN hub provides continuou s, intensive and comprehensive child development and family suppor t services, along with professiona l development (PD) and wideran ging assistance to child care partners (CCPs) in meetin g EHS standar ds. Currently, the QIN serves childre n in six of the eight wards (g eographical sections/groups of neighborhoods) in DC. All services provided through this initiative are fullday (no less than 10 hours) and fully ear (no less than 48 weeks). In addition to OSSE's direct role in managing and supporting the QIN, the Head Start State Collaboration Office located within OSSE DEL s upports coordination and collaboration bet ween the ifour EHS CCP grantees and OSSE DEL, other OSSE divisions, and local educatio n agencies. Because the District o ffers universal prek, many chi ldren transition directly from EHS pro grams to prek within LEAs, and HSSCO partners with EHS programs and LE As to support these transition s. All the EHS grantees located in the Dist rict are licensed child care fa cilities and participate in the District's ch ild care subsidy program and OS SE DEL and the HSSCO partner with EHS programs to address questions or con cerns related to licensing and subsidy policies and practices and see k input to inform these policies and practi ces to support alignment of EHS and CCDF policies to the extent possible. ii. State/territory institutions for higher education, inclu ding community colleges. Describe: The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) is an active member of the Higher Education Ea rly Childhood Collaborative. M embership of this group has changed over time, but typically includes repres entatives from the University of the Dist rict of Columbia, Trinity Washington Univ ersity and American University. This group typically meets quarterly and is charged with ensuring supports for higher education de gree attainment. OSSE also fund s, coordinates and collaborates with the T.E.A.C .H. program, which works with various local and national universities to support the workforce in attaining an associate's or bachelor's degree in early child hood. OSSE's Division of Early Learning works closely with OSSE's Division of P ostsecondary and Career Educat ion to coordinate engagement and partnerships with higher education institutions in the District and outreach to early childhood educators about postsecondary e ducation offerings and funding opportunities , such as theaAdult College Completion Fair. iii. Other federal, state, local, and/or private agencies provi ding early childhood and schoolage/youthserving developmental services. Describe: The Office o f the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) works closely with the Office of Out of School Time Grants and Youth Outcomes located within the Office of the Deputy Mayor of Education, the 21st Century after school program administered by OSSE K12 Systems and Supports Division and local educational agencies (e.g. traditional publi c schools and public charter sch ools) to support access to and coordination of funding for schoolaged programs. iv. State/territory agency responsible for implementing the Maternal and Child Home Visitation p rograms grant. Describe: The Office of the State Superint endent of Education (OSSE) Divi sion of Early Learning (DEL) works closely wit h the District of Columbia Dep artment of Health, which administers th e District's evidencebased Maternal, Infant and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program (MIECHV) program. OSSE DEL participates in the District of Columbia Home Visiting Council (HV Council), which works to strengthen the un derstanding, implementation, an d sustainability of home visiting as a strategy to support positi ve child and family outcomes in the District of Colu mbia. The HV Council developed and approved a new 202123 strategic plan, incl uding six key goals. These goa ls focus on, among other things, promoting welltrained and supported home v isitors to increase the capacity of the wor kforce to deliver home visiting services, with appropriate adaptations to addre ss the impact of COVID19; deep ening the HV Council and home visitors' pursuit of racial justice; and devel oping a District wide coordinated intake system for home visiting. Additionally, Georgetown University recently completed a MIECHV Needs A ssessment on beh alf of the HV Council, with key recommendations that the HV Council is pursui ng. The HV Council meets bimonthly. OSSE i s a member of the HV Counc il's cintake (centralized/coordinated intake) subcommittee, which works to d evelop a referral and intake system for ho me visiting in order to improv e access to appropriate home visiting serv ices for families who might benef it from them. The cintake subcommittee also meets bimonthly . v. Agency responsible for Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnos tic, and Treatment Program. Describe: The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) wo rks closely with the DC Department o f Health Care Finance (DC HCF) Finance on outreach, engagement and professional development regarding Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatme nt (EPSDT) services. OSSE and DC HC F have a shared commitment to provide early, comprehensive, regular and as needed medical, behavioral, and dental screenings for all eligible children. Th rough ongoing meetings and collabo rations, OSSE and DC HCF align policies so that all CCDF eligibl e children receive development al screenings (within an appropriate timeframe) and child development centers use these screenings to a ssess a child's health status, identify risks or concerns, and intervene when necessary. vi. State/territory agency res ponsible for child welfare. Des cribe: The Office of the State Superint endent of Education (OSSE) OSSE works closely with the District of Columbia Child and Fa mily Services Agency (CFSA) on a number of early childhood initiatives including trainings on child abuse awaren ess and prevention trainings for child development staff. OSSE also partners with CFSA to conduct background checks for current a nd prospective child development staff. Senior leadership members participate on the interagency steering comm ittee for OSSE's Early Head StartChild Care Partnershi p, the Quality Improvement Netw ork (QIN). Through the QIN, OSSE and CFSA coordinate referrals for subsidized chil d care for children under the care and supervision of CFSA and facilitate processes for l inking these children to early intervention services . For children removed from their homes between the ages 04 year s, CFSA can provide temporary emergency inhome child care services. During this ti me, CFSA partners with resource parents to review child care needs and provide support in locating a facility to meet the family's needs. Financia l support to resource parents is provided by securing an OSSE child care voucher or using CFSA's child subsidy program to help defray child care cost. Additionally, CFSA nurses support developmental screenings for all children involved with CFSA from birth to age five . During the ch ild protective services investigation, social workers and nurses refer infants and children to OSSE vi a the Health Services Administration. OSSE will contact the caregiver and schedule th e screening. When children are separated from the ir families following an investi gation, a developmental screening is conducted by a Nurse Practitioner in the Healthy H orizons Assessment Center within thirty days. In addition, developmental screening s are performed by community nurses that su pport inhome families vii. Provider groups or associations. Describe: OSSE regularly collaborates with District organizations repres enting child care providers, including the DC Head Start Association (DCHSA), DC Association for the Education of Young Children, DC Fa mily Child Care Association, Directors Exchange, Multicultural Spanish Speaking Pr oviders Association and Washin gton Association of Child Care Centers. DCHSA and OSSE staff meet multipl e times a month and cohost m ultiple events on an ongoing basis. DCHSA is the voic e of diverse Head Start program s (birth to five) that serves as a vehicle to educate a nd empower families, early lear ning professionals, business leaders, philanthropies, and elected officials to advo cate for highquality, continuous, and comprehensive ea rly childhood development suppo rts and services to ensure that all children are rea dy to succeed in school and in life. OSSE meets at least twice a year with members of other provider association groups listed above, and convenes represe ntatives of these association s on an asneeded basis throughout the year to solicit input and feedback on policy an d practice questions. viii. Parent groups or organizations. Describe: As part of the Head Start Progra m Performance Standards (HSPPS) , the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) as the grant administr ator for the EHSCCP QIN program ensures that all en rolled QIN parents automatically become members of their center's parent committee, the forum in which parent info rmation is exchanged and learning opportunities are s upported. Parents interested in becoming more involved are encouraged to par ticipate on the policy council, w ith whom the State Superintendent works in a shared decisionmaking model. Through the policy council, parents develop their leadersh ip skills. The policy council con sists of parent representatives from each of the participating QIN centers and five members of the community. The chair, vicechair and secretary positions that m ake up the executive members of the policy council are elected annually. OSSE DEL supports and attends the parentled Interagency Coordi nating Council (ICC). The ICC's purpose is to advise a nd assist the Mayor and OSSE in its role as the lead agency in the development and im plementation of a Districtwide , comprehensive, coordinated, multidisciplinary, interagency system to provide e arly intervention services for infants and toddlers with developmental delays and disabilities. The ICC meets quarterly. OSSE DEL coordinates with and sits on the Thrive by Five Coordi nating Council, which includes parent representatives from every ward in the District as well as agency representatives. To demonstrate the District's commitment to ma ternal health and early child development and education, Mayor Bowser launched Th rive by Five DC, the District's first comprehensi ve childhood health and early l earning initiative. Thrive by Five's mission is to create t he best possible start for DC c hildren by connecting families and caregivers with a community of resources, educatio n, and support that all children need to thrive by five. The Coordinating Council m eets quarterly. Parents of children served in th e District's mixed delivery sys tem (MDS) for early childhood care and ed ucation are also rep resented on the SECDCC . ix. Other. Describe: 1.5 Optional Use of Combined Funds, CCDF Matching, and Maintenance of Effort Funds Optional Use of Combined Funds: States and territories have t he option to combine CCDF funds with any required program in 1.4.1. These programs includ e those operating at the federal, state, and local levels for children in preschool prog rams, tribal early childhood programs, and other early childhood programs, including those s erving infants and toddlers with disabilities, children expe riencing homelessness, and chil dren in foster care (658E(c)(2)(O)(ii)). Combining funds could include blending multiple funding streams , pooling funds, or layering funds together from multiple funding streams to expand and/or enhance services for infants, toddlers, preschool ers, and schoolage children an d families to allow for the delivery of comprehensive quality care that meets the needs of children and families. For example, state/territory agencies may use multiple funding sour ces to offer grants or contracts to programs to deliver services; a state/territory ma y allow a county/local government to use coordinated fu nding streams; or policies may be in place that allow local programs to layer CCDF funds with additional funding sour ces to pay for fullday, full year child care that meets Early Head Start/Head Start Program Performance Standards or state/territory Prekindergarten requirements in addition to sta te/territory child care licensing requirements. As a reminder, CCDF funds may be used in collaborative efforts with Head Start programs to provide comprehensive child care and development services for c hildren who are eligible for both programs. In fact, the coordination and collaboration between Head Start and CCDF is strongly encouraged by se ctions 640(g)(1 )(D) and (E); 6 40(h); 641(d)(2)(H)(v); and 642(e)(3) of the Head Start Act in the provision of full workin g day, full calendar year comprehensive services. To imple ment such collaborative program s, which share, for example, space, equipment, or ma terials, grantees may layer sev eral funding streams so that seamless services are provi ded (Policy and Program Guidanc e for the Early Head Start - Child Care Partnerships: https://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/def ault/files/occ/acf_im_ohs_15_0 3.pdf). 1.5.1 Does the Lead Agency choose to combine funding for CCDF service s for any programs identified in 1.4.1 (98.14(a)(3))? No (If no, skip to question 1.5.2) Yes. If yes, describe at a minimum: a. How you define \"combine\" The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) defines combining funds as layering funds together from multipl e funding streams to expand and/or enhance services for infants, toddlers, preschool ers and schoolage children and families to allow for the delivery of comprehensiv e quality care that meets the needs of children and families. For example, OSSE lay ers CCDF funding with local preK enhancemen t dollars to ensure that eligible childre n enrolled in prek programs receive a full day of care. The preK enhancement supp lements, not supplants, the CCDF fun ds. The lead agency also uses CCDF funds to support child care subsidy reimbursements for Qualit y Improvement Network (QIN) Ex pansion providers. . The Bainum Family Foundation provides funding to the QIN hub that supplements other funding sources for provis ion of professional development and other supports. b. Which funds you will combine? CCDF funds and locally appropriat ed District funds c. What is your purpose and expected outcomes for combining funds, such as extending the day or year of services available (i.e., fullday, fullyea r programming for working families), smoothing transitions for children, enhancing and al igning quality of services, linking comprehensive services to children in child c are, or developing the supply of child care for vulnerable populations? Note: Respon ses should align with the goals, processes and results describe in 1.4.1. PreK enh ancement funds cover 6.5 hours of the day and CCDF funds are layered to ensure a ful l day of care. Using CCDF subsidy funds to pay for child care services at QIN Expans ion sites links comprehensive services to children in the subsidized child care program. The comprehensive services promote o verall health and social and em otional well being, through screenings, oral and heal th exams and mental health sup ports. e. How you will be combining multiple sets of funding, such as at the state/territory level, local level, program level? The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) combines multiple sets of funding by layering CCDF and locally appropriated preK enhancement funds to ensure a full day of care. CCDF funds are paid directly to QIN expansion providers to support daily child car e activities. . 1.5.2 How are the funds tracked and method of oversight Funds are tra cked using the District's accounting system of record for CCDF and T ANF funds, as well as the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) Enterprise Grant Management System for funds allocated such as the preK enhancement funds. Which of the following funds does the Lead Agency intend to use to mee t the CCDF matching and MOE req uirements described in 98.55(e) and 98.55(h)? Ch eck all that apply. Note: Lead Agencies that use Prekindergarten funds to meet matching r equirements must check Prekindergarten funds and public and/or private funds. Us e of PreK for Maintenance of Effort: The CCDF Final Rule clarifies that public PreK funds ma y also serve as maintenanceof effort funds as long as the state /territory can describe how it will coordinate PreK and child care services to expand the availability of child care while us ing public Prekindergarten funds as no more than 20 percent of the state's or territory's mainte nance of effort or 30 percent of its matching funds in a single fiscal year (FY) (98.55(h)). If expenditures for PreK services are used to meet the maintenanceof effort requirement, the state/t erritory must certify that it has not reduced its level of effort in fullday/fullyear child care services (98.55(h)(1); 98.15(a)(6)). Use of Private Funds for Match or Maintenance of Effort: Donate d funds do not need to be under the administrative control of the Lead Agency to qualify as an expenditure for federal match. However, Lead Agencies do need to identify and designate in the state/territory Plan the donated funds given to public or privat e entities to implement the CCDF child care program (98.55(f)). a. N/A\u2014The territory is not required to meet CCDF matching a nd MOE requirements. b. Public funds are used to meet the CCDF matching fund require ment. Public funds may include any general revenue funds, county or other local pu blic funds, state /territoryspecific funds (tobacco tax, lottery), or any other public funds. i. If checked, identify the source of funds: The FY21 locall y appropriated child care subsidy budget is sufficient to meet (and in fact substant ially exceeds) CCDF matching and MOE requirements. The Office of the State Superin tendent of Education (OSSE) does not anticipate any reductions to the locally approp riated budget in future years. c. Private donated funds are used to meet the CCDF matching fun ds requirement. Only private funds received by the designated entities or by the Lea d Agency may be counted for match purposes (98.53(f)). i. If checked, are those funds: A. Donated directly to the state? B. Donated to a separate entity(ies) designated to receive priv ate donated funds? ii. If checked, identify the name, address, contact, and type of en tities designated to receive private donated funds: d. State expenditures for PreK programs are used to meet the CC DF matching funds requirement. If checked, provide the estimated percentage of th e matching fund requirement that will be met with Prekindergarten expenditures (not to exceed 30 percent): i. If the percentage is more than 10 percent of the matching fund requirement, describe how the state will coordinate its Prekindergarten and child care services: ii. Describe the Lead Agency efforts to ensure that Prekindergarten programs meet the needs of working parents: e. State expenditures for Prekindergarten programs are used to meet the CCDF maintenanceofeffort requirements. If checked, i. Assure by describing how the Lead Agency did not reduce its lev el of effort in fullday/fullyear child care services, pursuant to 98.55(h)(1) and 98.15(a)(6). ii. Describe the Lead Agency efforts to ensure that Prekindergarten programs meet the needs of working parents: iii. Estimated percentage of the MOE Fund requirement that will be m et with Prekindergarten expenditures (not to exceed 20 percent): . iv. If the percentage is more than 10 percent of the MOE requiremen t, describe how the state will coordinate its Prekindergarten and child care services to expand the availability of child care: f. The same funds are used to m eet at least some of the CCDF MO E and TANF MOE requirements. i. If known, what percent of f unds used to meet CCDF MOE also i s used to meet TANF MOE requirements? 1.6 PublicPrivate Partnerships Lead Agencies are required to describe how they encourage publi cprivate partnerships among other public agencies, tribal organizations, private enti ties, faithbased organizations, businesses or organizations that promote business involvement, and/or communitybased organizations to leverage existi ng service delivery (i.e., coop erative agreement among providers to pool resources to pay for shared fixed costs and operation) (658E(c )(2)(P)). ACF expects these types of partnerships to leverage public and priv ate resources to further the goals of the CCDBG Act. Lead Agencies are required to demonstra te how they encourage publicprivate partnerships to leverage existing child care and early education servicedelivery systems and to increase the s upply and quality of child care se rvices for children younger than age 13, for example, by implementing voluntary shared serv ice alliance models (98.14(a)(4)). 1.6.1 Identify and describe any publicprivate partnerships encourage d by the Lead Agency to leverage public and private resources to further the goals of t he CCDBG Act. Include in the response any publicprivate partnerships that have emerged from the response to the COVID 19 pandemic (98.16(d)(2)) and if a pplicable, how those partners hips will be continued post pandemic. The District of Columbia has a unique government structure and operates as a state, county, and a city, with the authority o f each of these distinct types of government. OSSE, as DC's state education agency, Lead Agency fo r CCDF and as a part of the DC government, has many partnerships with other DC government agencies (as described in 1.4) and with private organizations to support early c are and education providers to promote health and safety of children and staff, provide highquality early learning and mee t families' child care needs by sustaining and growing the early care and education sector. Spe cific publicprivate partnership activities include: Supporting Early Care and Education Providers OSSE's Division of Early Learni ng and Division of Postsecondary and Career Education partners with one another and District hi gher education institutions to host Adult college Completion Fairs: Early Childhood Educators Edition. This initiative provi des focused support to DC's early childhood education workforce in learning about programs and re sources to help gain their respective education credential. OSSE funds two grantees, CentroNi a and Southeast Children's Fun d, to provide scholarships and supports through their Child Deve lopment Associate (CDA) progra ms, which are offered in English, Spanish, and Amharic. T he grantees also provide schola rship funding to cover the CDA application fee for th ose who obtain the required instructional hours outside of the grantees' programs, including via Quorum. The National Black Child Develop ment Institute (NBCDI) administ ers the Teacher Education and Compensation Helps (T.E.A.C.H.) program on behalf of OSSE. In F Y2020, there were 137 active scholars (i.e. teachers, directo rs or expanded home caregivers) in the T.E.A.C.H. program working on either an associate or bachelor's degree. Additional ly, there are several assistant teachers enrolled in the program with hopes of earning their de gree and becoming a lead teacher. OSSE piloted the First Step CDA Career and Technical Education (CTE) program in FY17, which provides high school students th e opportunity to work towards e arning their CDA credential and high school diploma at the same time. For the 201920 school y ear, there were 162 students in the First Step CDA Program acro ss three DC Public Schools and o ne DC Public Charter School high school site, that successfully graduated 62 students. Curr ently enrolled in the program for the 202021 school year, there are 163 students participating, with 55 expected graduates. This includes students from the previ ous school year who are in thei r second year of the program. In partnership with Quality Assi st (Quorum), OSSE developed el earning trainings that are reflective of the unique needs of the District's workforce. For example, FY20 courses were offered on the topics of the basics of understanding autism spe ctrum disorders, responsive feeding practices, etc. OSSE als o increased advertisement of Qu orum through the Professional Development Information System ( PDIS) to highlight new training s and the system as a whole. OSSE also updated the PDIS to au tomatically record Quorum cours e completion for the workforce in their individual PDIS profiles. OSSE received funding from the Trust for Learning, a philanthro pic foundation, to support the Supporting Equitable Educator Dev elopment grant aimed at provid ing training for trainers and a curriculum to integrate antibias, antiracist training into ed ucator training curricula and materials. The District of Columbia is also partnering with a Shared Servi ces Business Alliance (Alliance) for child development homes (CDHs) and expanded homes (CDXs). The A lliance supports CDHs and CDXs by helping members manage ope rational and administrative t asks thus reducing costs and workloads for these child care pr oviders, including enrollment, fee collection, backoffice support and provide needed techni cal assistance. The District b egan with enrolling 20 home based providers in June 2018. As of FY21, the District has expa nded the Alliance's network to 47 homebased providers (or 43 perc ent of all homebased providers ) and is in the process of further expanding the SSBA to include small child care centers. Providing HighQuality Learning OSSE partners with the Bainum Family Foundation to improve outc omes for our state's most vulnerable children and their fa milies. Our partnership focuses on improving the quality of child development facilities, authentic ally engaging families, enhanc ing the availability and use of data to inform policy and planning and increasing the supply of highquality infant and toddler care in wards 7 and 8, the areas of the city with the largest n umber of lowincome children. OSSE and Bainum have been in partnership since 2015. In additio n to the above activities, through this partnership OSSE launched a shared services webba sed platform that is free to all licensed child development provi ders, conducted a child care su pply and demand study, expanded and evaluated the Qualit y Improvement Network, provide d indepth and targeted technical assistance and training for providers and OSSE's gran tee partners. The OSSE and Bainum partnership also supports early childhood data analysis in OSSE's Division of Assessment and Research (DAR). Through the Early Head StartChild Care Partnership grant, OSSE established the Quality Improvement Network (QIN), a public private partnership with tw o neighborhoodbased hubs that provide quality services a nd support to a network of child development centers and homes. This model uses Early Head Start Program Performance Standards to increase the supply of high quality infant and toddler care in the District. To achieve the goal of enhancing young children's school readiness, the QIN sites provide comprehensive services to promote the overall health, development and wellbeing of infants and toddlers and their fa milies. OSSE is leveraging resources fr om District agencies to improve efficiencies and system coordination. To this end, OSSE established the QIN Interagency Steering Committee comprised of the following city agencies: DC Health, Department of Behavi oral Health, Department of Health Care Financing, Child and Family Services Agency and the Department of Human Services. The Interagency Steering Committe e meets monthly with our priva te sector hub agency partners to discuss specific are as of coordination and supports for the child care partners and the families and children they ser ve. This Committee helps leve rage and identify resources to improve the quality of child development facilities. Interagency partners also assist in providing professional deve lopment and technical assistance in areas such as employment trai ning, economic selfsufficiency , mental health and substance abuse treatment. Meeting the Needs of Families by S ustaining and Growing the Ear ly Care and Education Sector The District of Columbia is partnering two community developmen t financial institutions (CDFIs), the Washington Area Community Investment Fund (Wacif) and LowI ncome Investment Fund (LIIF), as subgrantees to manage emergency relief grants to ch ild care providers, using funds made available through the Coron avirus Aid, Relief, and Economi c Security Act and the Coronavirus Response and Recovery Supplemental Appropriations A ct. These partnerships build on successful past partnerships b etween the District and both C DFIs to support child care access and sustainability in the Distric t, and will enable child care providers to access technical assistance, business training, and other resources and supports available through Wacif and LIIF. During the public health emergenc y, the Division of Early Learn ing implemented weekly stakeholder calls to provide upda tes and information or health and safety guidance, payment policies, and regulatory fixes to assist the community with saf e operations, business planning and parent engagement, which transitioned to a biweekly basis in September 2020. The Division of Early Learning also stood up a stakeh older working group to help inform the childcare recovery and reopening plan. Additionally, the Quality Improv ement Network (QIN) - the Distr ict's EHSCCP focused on family and community engagement. The QIN provides all families with op portunity to participate in their respective parent committees, ACT Raising Safe Kids, pare nt caf\u00e9s and engagement in the fatherhood initiative. During the public health emergency, the QIN provided additional and ongoing supports related to mental health, piloting the ASQ onl ine, providing additional personal protective equipment (PPE) to facilities and supportin g oneonone checkins with families on a weekly basis with their family engagement special ists. 1.7 Coordination with Child Care Resource and Referral Systems Lead Agencies may use CCDF funds to establish or support a syst em or network of local or regional child care resource and referral (CCR&R) organizati ons that is coordinated, to the extent determined by the state/territory, by a statewide pu blic or private nonprofit, communitybased or regionally bas ed, lead child care resource a nd referral organization (such as a statewide CCR&R network) (658E(c )(3)(B)(iii); 98.52) . If Lead Agencies use CCDF funds f or local CCR&R organizations, the local or regional CCR&R organizations supported by those funds must , at the direc tion of the Lead Agency: Provide parents in the state with consumer education informatio n concerning the full range of child care options (inc luding faithbased and communit ybased child care providers), analyzed by provider, including child care provided during nontraditional hours and through emergency child care centers, in their area. To the extent practicable, work directly with families who rece ive assistance to offer the families support and assistance to make an informed decisio n about which child care providers they will use to ensure that the families are en rolling their children in the most appropriate child care setting that suits their needs and one that is of high quality (as determined b y the Lead Agency). Collect data and provide informat ion on the coordination of ser vices and supports, including services under Part B , Section 619 and Part C of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Collect data and provide information on the supply of and deman d for child care services in areas of the state and submit the information to the state. Work to establish partnerships with public agencies and private entities, including faith based and communitybased child care providers, to increase the supply and quality of child care services in the state and, as appropriate, coordinat e their activities with the activities of the state Lead Age ncy and local agencies that adm inister funds made available through CCDF (98.52(b)). Nothing in the statute or rule p rohibits states from using CCR& R agencies to conduct or provide additional services beyo nd those required by statute or rule. Note: Use 1.7.1 to address if a state /territory funds a CCR&R organiz ation, describe what services are provided and how it is structured. Use subsection 7.5 to address the services provided by the local or regiona l child care resource and refer ral agencies and the indicators of progress met by CCR&R organizations if they are funded by qu ality setaside funds. 1.7.1 Does the Lead Agency fund local or regional CCR&R organizations ? No. The state/territory does not fund a CCR&R organization(s) a nd has no plans to establish one. Yes. The state/territory funds a CCR &R organization(s) with all th e responsibilities outlined above. If yes, describe the following: How are CCR&R services organized? Include how many agencies, if there is a statewide network, and if the system is coordinated: DC Child Care Connections, the child care resource and referral agency for the District, s erves the entire geographic area of the state. The communitybased organization operating DC Child Care Connections works as part o f a consortium with the grantee selected through a competitive grant process in which a panel of experts reviewed applications and selected the application that bes t fit the needs and context of DC. DC Child Care Connections has two walkin ser vice centers in easily accessibl e locations in the District and operates a hotline that parents can call for suppo rt in accessing child care, including during the public health emergency. Through the ir accessibility to the public, DC Child Care Connect ions works to connect local an d national with organizations, DC public agencie s, other grantees and the commu nity with the services they need. Through the ir network, DC Child Care Connec tions offers one onone technical assistance to both providers and families. Add itionally, DC Child Care Connections has s trong working relationships with other Di strict agencies, participates in various meetings and provides feedback on polic ies and practices based on their knowledge and experience of DC and the needs of the community. DC Child Care Connections caters to families, providers and the public and partners with the Department of Human Ser vices, DC Health, Department of Employment Services, District Ward Advisory Neighborhood Commissions and O SSE's Homeless Education State Coordinator. Thi s information is provided to fa milies, providers and the general public through community events, parent workshops, collaboration with other family support services a nd during inperson visits to th e DC Child Care Connections service centers. The information is tailored to the audience based on their needs. 1.8 Disaster Preparedness and Response Plan In past disasters, and in respons e to the COVID19 pandemic, th e provision of emergency child care services and rebuildin g and restoring of child care infrastructure has emerged as an essential service. Lead Agencies are required to establish a St atewide Child Care Disaster Plan (658E(c)(2)(U)). They must demonstrate how they will address th e needs of children\u2014 including the need for safe child care before, during, and afte r a state of emergency declared by the Governor, or a major disa ster or emergency (as defined b y Section 102 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, 42 U. S.C. 5122)\u2014through a Statewide Disaster Plan. The effective date for the establishme nt of this Statewide Disaster Plan was October 1, 2018. 1.8.1 Did you make any updates to the Statewide Disaster Plan since t he FY 20192021 CCDF Plan was submitted? Please consider any updates that were made as a result of the Lead Agency's experiences in responding to the COVID19 pandemic.

A key purpose of the CCDBG Act is to \"promote involvemen t by parents and family members in the development of their children in child care sett ings\" (658A(b)). Lead Agencies have the opportunity to consider how information can b e provided to parents through the child care assistance system, partner agencies, and child care consumer education websites. The target audience fo r the consumer education information incl udes three groups: parents receiving CCDF assistance, the ge neral public, and when appropr iate, child care providers. OCC expects that Lead Agencies are using targeted strategies fo r each group to ensure tailored consumer education infor mation. In this section, Lead Agencies will address how information is made available to families, the general public a nd child care providers to assist them in accessing highquality child care and how inform ation is shared on other financial assistance programs or supports for which a family mi ght be eligible. In addition, Lead Agencies will certify that i nformation on developmental sc reenings is provided and will describe how research and best practices concerning children's development, including their socialemotional development, is shared. This section also covers the par ental complaint process and the consumer education website that has been developed b y the Lead Agency. Finally, th is section addresses the consumer statement that is provi ded to parents supported with C CDF funds. Note: When asked for citations, responses can in clude state sta tute, regulations, administrative rules, policy manuals, or polic y issuances. See the Introducti on on page 4 for more detail. 2.1 Outreach to Families with Limited English Proficiency and Perso ns with Disabilities The Lead Agency is required to d escribe how it provides outreac h and services to eligible families with limited English prof iciency and persons with disa bilities and to facilitate the participation of child care prov iders with limited English prof iciency and child care providers with disabilities in the CCDF pro gram (98.16(dd)). Lead Agencie s are required to develop policies and procedures to clearly communicate program informat ion, such as requirements, consumer education information, and eligibility information, to families and child care providers of all backgrounds (81 FR 67456). 2.1.1 Check the strategies the Lead Ag ency or partners utilize to pro vide outreach and services to eligible families for whom English is not their first langua ge.

Lead Agencies must als o provide a detailed description of the hotline or similar reporting process for par ents to submit complaints about child care providers; the process for substantiating complaints ; the manner in which the Lead Agency maintains a record of substantiated parental complaints; and ways that the Lead Agency makes information on such parental complaints available to the public on request (98.16 (s); 98.32(d)). 2.2.1 Describe the Lead Agency's hotline or similar reporting process through which parents can submit complaints about child care providers, including a l ink if it is a Webbased process: The Office of the State Superintendent of Education ( OSSE) maintains a complaint hotline (202) 7272993 for parents to report issues w ith providers. Complaints can also be emailed to OSSE.ChildcareComplaints@dc.gov or faxed to the Licensing and Compliance Unit ( LCU) at (202) 7277295. Informat ion about how to submit a complaint is available on the OSSE website at: https://osse.dc.gov/service/earlylearningcomplaintsandunusu alincidentreporting including CCDF provider s and nonCCDF providers, describe the Lead Agency's process and timeline for screening, substantiating, and responding to complaints. Describe whether the process includes monitoring, and highlight any differences in processes for CCDF and nonCCDF providers an d licensed and license exempt providers:: Upon receiving a complaint regarding license d providers, including CCDF and non CCDF providers, the Office of the State Su perintendent of Education (OSSE) reviews the complaint to determine the l evel of severity of the complai nt. A Level I complaint is defined as a health or safety violation which requires the assi stance of law enforcement, Child Protective Services (CPS) or an immediate OSSE response. A Level II complaint is defined as a health or safety vi olation which may pose a seriou s health risk to children. A Level III complaint is defined as a violation which does not po se a serious or immediate health risk to children. OSSE responds to Level I complaints wi thin 24 hours, Level II Complaints within two business days and Level III Complaints w ithin three business days of the receipt of the complaint. Depending on the severity of the complaint, OSSE will initiate an investigation to monitor the facility and determine if the c omplaint is substantiated. A substantiated complaint is defin ed as a situation or incident t hat has been identified and verified as unsatisfactory or una cceptable based on the current child development facility regulations and/or provider agr eements. If OSSE s ubstantiates a complaint, OSSE will issue statement of deficiencies (SOD) or an enforcement action with a corrective action plan. The corrective action plans always in clude a monitoring component t o ensure providers are taking action to comply with licensing regulations . The District uses the same process regarding screening, substantiating, and responding to complain ts for CCDF and nonCCDF providers. Upon receiving a complaint regarding an inhome and relative ca re provider (the District's CCDF licenseexempt providers), OSSE w ill review the incident to det ermine the severity of the complaint. If the complaint ri ses to the level of child endange rment, the complaint will be reported to the Child and Family Services Agency for further investigation. If the complaint does not pose a risk t o the health and safety of the child, but a substantiated concern is identified, OSSE will issue a deficiency to the provider and fo llow up within 30 days to ensure the issue is remediated. 2.2.3 Certify by describing how the Le ad Agency maintains a record of substantiated parental complaints. Highlight any differences in processes for CCDF and nonCCDF providers and licensed and licen seexempt providers: The Offi ce of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE ) maintains a record of all co mplaints, including parental complaints (both substa ntiated and unsubstantiated) ab out licensed child development facilities, including facilities receiving CCDF fun ding and nonCCDF funded facilities. The District uses the same process regarding screening, substantiating, and responding to complaints for CCDF and nonC CDF providers and licensed. These complaints are st ored in the licensing database system. Substantiated complaints are filed by date an d made available to the public v ia the Freedom of Information Act request procedur e and they are available on the My Child Care DC website. Substantiated complaint s records are maintained for a period of three years. 2.2.4 Certify by describing how the Lead Agency makes information abo ut substantiated parental complaints available to the pub lic; this information can includ e the consumer education website discussed in section 2.3: The Office of the State Sup erintendent of Education (OSSE) maintains a record of all compla ints, including parental compla ints (both substantiated and unsubstantiated) about providers. These complaints are stored i n the licensing database system. Substantiated complaints are filed by date and made ava ilable to the public via the Freedom of Information Act reque st procedure and they are avail able on the My Child Care DC website. Substantiated complain ts records are maintained for a period of three years. 2.2.5 Provide the citation to the Lead Agency's policy and process re lated to parental complaints: Per the Office of the State Superint endent of Education (OSSE) Chil d Care Facility Regulations Section 5A119 of the District of Columbia Municipal Regulation s (DCMR) Title 5 , Chapter nd makes available to the publi c by electronic means, a list of all of the Facilities licensed that includes license number, facility name, license type, location, license issue and expira tion dates, point of contact, contact information, and licensed capacity. OSSE maintains a com plaint hotline (202)7272993 for parents to report issues with providers. Complaints can also be emailed to OSSE.ChildcareComplaints@dc.gov or faxed to the Licensing and Compliance Un it (LCU) at (202) 7277295. See information available at: https://osse.dc.gov/service/earl ylearningcomplaintsandunusu alincidentreporting . 2.3 Consumer Education Website States and territories are required to provide information to p arents, the general public, and when applicable, child care prov iders through a state website, which is consumerfriendly and easily accessible (658E(c)(2 )(E)(i)(III) and 98.33 (a)).

(Note: While there is no Federal CCDF definition fo r easily accessible, Lead Agencies may consider easily accessible websites to be searchab le, simple to navigate, written in plain language, and easy to understand.): My Child Care DC is a consumerfriendly website that helps fami lies find and compare child care options (http://childcareconnections.osse.dc.gov/ ). My Child Care DC allows families to search centerbased and homebased licen sed child development provider s by distance from a particular address or zipcode. Co nsumers can filter options by operating hours, type of facility, age range of children served and quality improvement ratings. T he website also specifies which child development providers accept child care subsidies and par ticipate in the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP). The website includes a detailed, eas ytoread provider profile that provides inspection reports, cap acity, licensing information, a ccreditation and substantiated complaints. My Child Care DC is easily accessible from the OSSE , DC Child Care Connections and the Thrive by Five websites and is accessible from mobile devic es. To ensure that the My Child Care DC website is consumerfrie ndly and easily accessible, OSS E engaged focus groups of parents to test the design and n avigation of the site prior to launching. Furthermore, OSSE conducted a full self assessment of the My Child Care DC websi te, based on the State and Territory Child Care Consumer Educ ation Websites: SelfAssessme nt Checklist from the Administration for Child and Families (ACF). OSSE continues to monitor the usability of the website and identify needed enhancements to ensure it remains c onsumer friendly and easily accessible. 2.3.2 Describe how the website ensures the widest possible access to services for families that speak languages other than English (98.33(a)): Effective Sept. 30, 2018, My Child Care DC became available in all languages outlined in Chapter 12 (Language Access Act) o f Title 4 (Human Rights and R elations) of the District of Columbia Municipal Regulations ( DCMR).

A full report covers everything in the monitoring visit, including areas of compliance and noncomplia nce. If the state does not produce any reports that include areas of compliance, the websi te must include information about all areas covered by a mon itoring visit (e.g., by posting a blank checklist used by monitors). The reports must be in plain language or provide a plain langua ge summary, as defined by the state or territory, and be timel y to ensure that the results of the reports are available and easily understood by parents when they are deciding on a child care provider. Lead Agencies must post at least 3 years of reports. Certify by responding to the questions below: a. Does the Lead Agency post? (check one): X i. Full monitoring reports that include areas of compliance and noncompliance. ii. Monitoring reports that inclu de areas of noncompliance onl y, with information about all areas covered by a mon itoring visit posted separately on the website (e.g., a blank checklist used by monitors). Note: This option i s only allowable if the state/territory does not pro duce monitoring reports that in clude both areas of compliance and noncompliance. If checked, provide a direc t URL/website link to the website where a blank checklist is posted. Click or tap here to enter text. b. Check to certify that the monito ring and inspection reports and , if necessary, their plain language summaries include: X Date of inspection X Health and safety violations, i ncluding those violations that resulted in fatalities or serious injuries occurring at the provider. Describe how these health and safety violations are prominently displayed: The health and safety violation s and substantiated complaints are included in the provider profile along with the monitoring and inspection repor ts. These are all available through our consumerfriendly website, My Child Care DC. X Corrective action plans taken b y the state and/or child care p rovider.

How and where are reports posted in a timely manner? Specifical ly, provide the Lead Agency's definition of \"timely\" and describe how it ensures that reports and/or summaries are posted within its timeframe. Note: While Lead Agencies may define \"tim ely,\" we recommend Lead Agencies update results as soon a s possible and no later than 9 0 days after an inspection or corrective action is taken. Provide the direct URL/website link to where the reports are po sted. This is a sample:https://childcareconnections.osse .dc.gov/MychildCare/FacilityPr ofile?FacilityId=2193 i. Describe how the Lead Agency defines timely posting of monitori ng reports. Reports are posted upon final co mpletion of the monitoring and inspection, including the resolution of all appeals.

The pr ovider is given a detailed explanation of the inaccuracy and acknowledges receipt and agre ement with the corrected SOD. The licensing database is correct ed to reflect the changes on t he corrected SOD. For license exempt relative and in home care providers, the Edu cation Services program manager reviews each inspection report for accuracy, completene ss, comprehensiveness and consistency. All inaccuracies ide ntified are immediately flagge d and corrected. The provider is notified of any inaccuracies ide ntified and a corrected SOD is issued to the provider. The provider is given a detailed explanation of the inaccuracy and acknowledges receipt and agreement with the corrected SOD . The provider database is corr ected to reflect the changes on the corrected SOD. f. Describe the process for providers to appeal the findings in re ports.

Providers have the right to dis pute the monitoring and inspecti on report in writing to the director of licensing and request a review of the inspection re port. The request must be made within five days of the inspection completion date. If the pro vider disagrees with the non compliance citation, they can re fuse to sign the SOD and state their disagreement with the report or portions of the report on the provider acknowledgemen t form. They can also attach documentation to support their o bjection to and/or disagreement with the report. The program manager reviews the appeal and th e documentation presented and forwards the appeal and all relevant inspection documents to the director of licensing for review. The director of licensing reviews the appeal and inspection documents, interviews the pro vider, licensing specialist and program manager as needed, consults with the Office of the Stat e Superintendent of Education's Office of the Genera l Counsel and makes a determina tion to allow or disallow the appeal. The decision is communica ted in writing to the provider with 15 days of the appeal filing. If the provider is not satisfied with the determination of the director of licensing, they can further request a final review within five days of the appeal decision to the Assistant Superintendent for Early Learning, whose decision is considered final. g. Describe the process for maintaining monitoring and inspection reports on the website. Specifically, provide the minimum number of years reports are p osted and the policy for removing reports ( 98.33(a)(4)(iv)). The licensing monitor reviews and submits the monitoring report s to the licensing supervisor for approval. The licensing supervisor reviews and submits the repo rts to the director of licensing for approval. The director of licensing reviews and approves the re port for website posting. The monitoring reports are posted for a minimum of three years and will be removed after that timeline. 2.3.8 Aggregate data on serious injuri es, deaths, and substantiated c ases of child abuse that have occurred in child care settings each year must be posted b y Lead Agencies on the consumer education website (98. 33(a)(5)). The serious incident aggregate data should include information about any ch ild in the care of a provider e ligible to receive CCDF, not just children receiving subsidies. This aggregate information on serious injuries and deaths must be separated by category of care (e.g. centers, family child care homes, and inhome care) and licensing status (i.e. licensed or licenseexempt) for all eligible CCDF providers in the state. The information on instances of substantiated child abuse does not have to be orga nized by category of care or licensing status. Information sho uld also include the total num ber of children regulated to be cared for by provider type and licensing status (81 FR, p. 6 7477), so that families can view the serious injuries, deaths, and substantiated cases of a buse data in context. The aggregate report should not include individual providerspecifi c information or names. a. Certify by providing: i.

OSSE uses the Early Development Instrument (EDI) to collect and share information about children's development and school readiness outcomes at a neigh borhood and citywide level. EDI is an internationally recogni zed, holistic tool that assess es children's readiness in five domains: physical health and wellbeing, language and cognitive development, social competence, emotional maturity and communication skills and gen eral knowledge. OSSE works with DC schools and communitybas ed organizations to administer the EDI to children in the Spring prior to Kindergarten entry. OSSE collected Wave 2, Roun d 1 of the EDI during the 2018 2019 school year and Round 2 data was planned for collection du ring the 201920 school year. OSSE cancelled the data collect ion for the 20202021 school yea r due to the ongoing public health emergency, but is currently working with Local Education Agencies (LEAs) serving prek students, communitybased organizations and the national organi zations that supports localities in implementing the EDI to plan for a third wave of EDI impleme ntation following the public health emergency. In addition to data on children's development across the five domains referenced above, Wave 2 data co llected included analysis on th e Neighborhood Risk Index (NRI), composite measurement of ten indicators of neighborhood level risk which can be associated with higher levels of developmental vulnerability in children. Combined, the EDI and the NRI, enable OSSE and community , education, and DC. governme nt partners to analyze patterns of risk across neighborhoods and identify areas where children, families, and communities may need additional resources and supports. These d ata serve as a foundation to understanding child development in the early care and education sector and will help the District improve conditions for children and families. 2.4.4 Describe how information on the Lead Agency's policies regardin g the socialemotional and behavioral issues and mental health of young children, includin g positive behavioral intervention and support models b ased on research and best prac tices for those from birth to school age, are shared with fam ilies, providers, and the genera l public.

On May 6, 2015, the District of Columbia approved the PreK Stu dent Discipline Amendment Act of 2015, published in http://lims.dccouncil.us/Dow nload/33194/B210001SignedAct.pdf for families, providers and the gener al public. The legislation pro hibits the suspension or expulsion of a student of preKindergarten age from any publicly funded p reKindergarten program, including those operated by loca l education agencies and commun itybased organizations, unless a school administrator determines that the student has w illfully caused or attempted to cause bodily injury or threatene d serious bodily injury to anot her person, excluding selfdefense. Suspensions must not exceed longer than three days for any ind ividual incident. The legislation establishes annual reporting requirements for each local educat ion agency on suspensions and expulsions data for all grades. OSSE collects discipline data through a Discipline Data Collection Template and uses this information to publish an annual report to the DC Council on all disciplinary incidents and action s that occurred in the prior s chool year. The annual report is widely distributed to OSSE's child development centers, homes, local education agencies and other stakeholders, and training and professional development i s developed to support child development centers to comply with the requirements for prevent ing suspensions and expulsions. In addition to the Pr eK Student Discipline Amendme nt Act of 2015, OSSE also requires, through our Child Development Facility Regulations, t hat a licensee shall use positive methods of child guidance that meet the individual needs of eac h child and encourage self control, selfdirection, selfes teem and cooperation (5A DCMR \u00a7 141), and requires providers to maintain and provide to OSSE, upon request, for each enrolled c hildren, a record of any suspensions or expulsions (5A DC MR \u00a7 130.7). Providers particip ating in the Quality Improvement Network (QIN) and the PreK Enhancement and Expansi on program receive the support of mental health consul tants through a partnership with the Department of Behavioral Health's Healthy Futures program . All providers participating i n Capital Quality, DC's redesigned Quality Rating and Improvement System, also receive the support of a quality facilitator who works oneonone with center dir ectors and child development ho me caregivers to provide support and connect them to need ed resources. In Fall 2020, OS SE applied to and was awarded a grant, Supporting Equitable Educ ator Development (SEED) throu gh the Trust for Learning, to ensure the District's early educator workforce has access to me aningful training and resources that aid in developing culturally responsive learning environme nts for young children and their families. Using a trainthetrain er approach, this project aims to ensure early educators in DC have the requisite skills, knowledge and appreciation of divers ity to create cult urally responsive ideal learning environments for all children and families in DC Additionally, 2.5 Procedures for Providing Information on Developmental Screening s Lead Agencies are required to provide information on developmen tal screenings to parents, the general public and, when applicable, child care providers. Information should include: Existing resources and services that the state can use in condu cting developmental screenings and providing referrals to services fo r children who receive child care assistance. Lead Agencies must also include a description of how a family o r child care provider can use these resources and services to obtain developmental sc reenings for children who receive subsidies and who might be at risk of cognitive or other developmental delays, which can include social, emotional, physical, or lingu istic delays (658E(c)(2)(E)(ii)). This information about the resou rces can include the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment program under the Medicaid program car ried out under title XIX of the Social Security Act and developmental screening services available under IDEA Part B, Section 619 and Part C, in co nducting those developmental screenings and in providing referrals to services for childre n who receive subsidies. Lead Agencies are required to provide this information to eligible families during CCDF intak e and to child care providers through training and education (98.33(c)). Information on devel opmental screenings, as other consumer education informat ion, should be accessible for individuals with limited English proficiency and indi viduals with disabilities. 2.5.1 Certify by describing: a. How the Lead Agency collects and disseminates information on ex isting resources and services available for conducting developmental screenings to C CDF parents, the general public, and where applicable, child care providers(98.1 5(b)(3)). Strong Start, the District of Col umbia's Early Intervention Pro gram (DC EIP), is administered through OSSE and serves as the single point of entry for infant s and toddlers whose families or others have concerns about th eir development. Strong Start p rovides services through program staff and approved contr actors. Strong Start collaborat es with child development facilities on an ongoing basis to provide training for child de velopment facility staff on how to conduct, implement and utilize the Ages and Stages Questionn aire3 (ASQ3) and the Ages and Stages Questionnaire Social Emotional (ASQ: SE2) de velopmental screenings with the children they care for. After each child development c enter training, center directors, teachers and home providers are asked if they would like to schedule an official screening event for their facilit y in the future where Child Fi nd staff will assi st in conducting developmental screenings. Child Find staff also participate in the ongoing expansion use of the ASQ Online Developmental Scr eening Database for screening c hildren in the district. Child Find staff continue to pr ovide available TA support to th e current 16 pilot child development facilities within the Quality Improvement Network. Strong Start has made developmental screening informat ion and trainings available at both CCR&R locations, as well as in the Professional Devel opment Information System (PDI S) for child development facilities. Strong Start provides bimonthly developmental scr eening/early intervention referral training on the PDIS plat form accessible by all licens ed child development facilities in the district. In addition, St rong Start has a developmental screening parent workshop available, that has been used with parent networking groups, fa mily success centers, DC Public Library staff development groups, and other communityba sed organizations. At all outreach events, Strong Start pr ovides a signin sheet that is used to follow up and reach out to families who are interested in developmental screening i nformation. Strong Start has an informal developmental screen ing request process established with the District's Child and Family Services Agency (CFSA), where the Child Find staff r eceive direct requests for screenings from the Ch ild Protective Servic es unit within CFSA. Children ages 2 years and eight months to 5 years and 10 mo nths who are not enrolled in a DCPS or public charter school receive screening and evaluations through Early Stages, operated by the District of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS). Information on how to submit a referral for a 3 to 5year old child not currently enrolled in school is available at http ://www.earlystagesdc.org/ . Once a referral is received, , a n Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ3) will be completed and, if necessary, the family w ill be scheduled for an appointm ent to bring the child in for an evaluation and eligibility determination. If the child is found eligible for services, an Individualized Education Program (IEP) is developed and the chi ld receives an appropriate placement in a DC Public School (DCPS). For children enrolled i n DCPS or public charter schools, a referral is made to the special education coordinato r, who arranges for the child to receive an evaluation and eligibility determination. b. The procedures for providing information on and referring famil ies and child care providers to the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment prog ram under the Medicaid program\u2014carried out under Title XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.)\u2014 and developmental screening services available under Part B, Se ction 619 and Part C of the Individuals with Disabilities Ed ucation Act (20 U.S.C. 1419, 14 31 et seq.).

O nce a referral is received, a n Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ3) will be co mpleted and, if necessary, the family will be scheduled for an appointment to bring the child in for an evaluation and elig ibility determination. If the child is found eligible for ser vices, an Individualized Educati on Program (IEP) is developed and the child receives an approp riate placement in a DC Public School (DCPS). For children enrolled in a DCPS or public cha rter school, a referral is made to the special education coordinator, who arranges for the child to receive an evaluatio n and eligibility determination. Children with developmental delays prior to age three who are determined eligible for preschool special education and who have a current IFSP may choose the Extended IFSP option and continue to receive Part C services un til the first day of school following the child's fourth birthday. In addition to the infor mation provided at the specific sites above, a brochure describi ng Part C and Part B services i s available on OSSE's website: https://osse.dc.gov/sites/defaul t/files/dc/sites/osse/publicati on/attachments/Comprehensiv e%20Child%20Find%20Brochure.pdf. c.

The District of Columbia Mayor 's Order 20093, dated Jan. 15, 2 009 nunc pro tunc to Aug. 16, 2009, designates OSSE a s the lead agency for CCDF and delegated the authority of the Mayor to administer the District law that governs subsid ized child care, D.C. Code \u00a7 4401 et seq. The copay require ments and exemptions are set f orth in Section 400.1 of OSSE's Eligibility Determinations for Subsidized Child Care Pol icy Manual and 5A DCMR \u00a7\u00a7 204.2 and 204.3 b. Families who are receiving or needing to receive protective services on a caseby case basis, as determined by the Lead Agency for purposes o f CCDF eligibility. Describe the policy and provide the policy citation. In additio n to the other requirements set forth in 5A DCMR\u00a7 201, in order to be eligibl e for subsidized child care in DC, a child shall, at the time of eligibility det ermination or redetermination meet the requirements for one of the following categories of need: (1) Resides with parent(s) who are working or attending a job training or education program; (2) Resides with parent(s) who is seeking em ployment or engaging in job search; or (3) Receives, or need to receive, pr otective services or is considered a vulnerable c hild, as defined herein. Protective Services is specifically defined as parent(s) or gua rdian(s) of children who are under the active supervision of CFSA Child Protective Servi ces division or under the active supervision of the Family Division of the DC Superio r Court due to abuse or neglect. The child may be livin g in the natural parent's hom e or with a third party.

The District of Columbia Mayor 's Order 20093, dated Jan. 15, 2 009 nunc pro tunc to Aug. 16, 2009, designates OSSE a s the lead agency for CCDF and delegated the authority of the Mayor to admini ster the District law that gove rns subsidized child care, D.C. Code\u00a7 4401 ection 200.6(b)(3) of OSSE's El igibility Determinations for Subsidized Child Care Policy Manual c. Families meeting other criteria established by the Lead Agen cy. Describe the policy. 3.2.5 Policies and processes for gradua ted phaseout of assistance at redetermination. Lead Agencies that establish initial family income eligibility below 85 percent of state median income (SMI) are required to pro vide a graduated phaseout of a ssistance for families whose income has increased above the state's initial income threshold at the time of redetermination but remains belo w the federal threshold of 85 p ercent of the state median income (98.21 (b)(1)). Providing a graduated phaseout promotes continuity by allowing for wage growth, allows for a tapered transition out of the child c are subsidy program as income increases, and supports longterm selfsufficiency for families . Lead Agencies that provide a graduated phaseout must implement a twotiered eligibility threshold, with the second tier of eligibility (used at the tim e of eligibility redetermination) to be set at: (i) 85 percent of SMI for a family of the same size. (ii) An amount lower than 85 percent of SMI for a family of the same size but above the Lead Agency's initial eligibility threshold that: (A) Takes into account the typical household budget of a lowincome family. (B) Provides justification that the second eligibility threshold is : (1) Sufficient to accommodate increases in family income over time that are typical for lowincome workers and that promote and support fam ily economic stability. (2) Reasonably allows a family to continue accessing child care ser vices without unnecessary disruption. At redetermination, a child shall be considered eligible if his or her parents are working or attending a job training or educ ational program even if their i ncome exceeds the Lead Agency's income limit to initia lly qualify for assistance as lo ng as their income does not exceed the second tier of elig ibility (98.21(a); 98.21(b)(1)). Note that once deemed eligible, the family shall be considered eligible for a full minimum 12m onth eligibility period, even if their income exceeds the second tier of eligibility during the eligibility period, as long as it does not exceed 85 percent of SMI. A family eligible for services via the graduated phaseout of a ssistance is considered eligible under the same conditions as other eligible families with the e xception of the copayment restrictions, which do not appl y to a graduated phaseout. To h elp families transition from child care assistance, Lead Agencies may gradually adjust copa y amounts for families whose children are determined eligible under a graduated phaseout an d may require additional reporting on changes in family income. However, Lead Agencies m ust still ensure that any additional reporting requirements do not constitute an undue bu rden on families. a. Check and describe the option that best identifies the Lead Age ncy's policies and procedures regarding the graduated phaseout of assistance. N/A. The Lead Agency sets its in itial eligibility threshold at 85 percent of SMI and therefore, is not required to provide a graduated phaseout per iod. (If checked, skip to subsection 3.3) The Lead Agency sets the second tier of eligibility at 85 perce nt of SMI. A. Describe the policies and procedures. New applicants are eligi ble for subsidized child care if such applicant(s) c an document an annual gross fa mily income up to 250 percent of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) or 85 percent of the current SMI, whichever is lower. During redetermination, families who are classified as being o ver the income threshold at the end of the 12month eligibility period are to be considered eligible up to 85 percent of the current SMI. During the 12 month eligibility period, families designated as eligible for subsidized child care and receiv ing such services whose income exceeds 85 percent of the current SMI shall continue to receive subsidized care fo r no more than three months. At the end of the three month period of continued assi stance, if the gross annual family income is below 85 percent of the most current SM I, assistance cannot be terminated and the chil d shall continue receiving ass istance until the next scheduled redetermination. Note, currently District regulati on and policy sets the graduat ed phase out level at 300 percent of FPL or up to 85 pe rcent of SMI, which ever is lo wer. B. Provide the citation for this policy or procedure. The District of Columbia Mayor's Order 20093 , dated Jan. 15, 2009 nunc pro tunc to Aug. 16, 2009, designates OSSE as the lead agency for CCDF and de legated the authority of the Mayor to administer the District law that governs subsidized child care, D.C. Code\u00a7 4401 et seq. The graduated phase out requirements are set forth in Section 500.4 of OSSE's Eligibility Determinations for S ubsidized Child Care Man ual and 5A DCMR \u00a7\u00a7 201.7 and 201.9. The Lead Agency sets the second tier of eligibility at an amoun t lower than 85 percent of SMI for a family of the same siz e but above the Lead Agency's i nitial eligibility threshold. A. Provide the income level for the second tier of eligibility for a family of three: B. Describe how the second eligibility threshold: 1. Takes into account the typical household budget of a lowincome family: 2. Is sufficient to accommodate increases in family income over ti me that are typical for lowincome workers and that promote and support fam ily economic stability: . 3. Reasonably allows a family to continue accessing child care ser vices without unnecessary disruption: 4. Provide the citation for this policy or procedure related to th e second eligibility threshold: b. To help families transition from assistance, does the Lead Agen cy gradually adjust copayments for families eligible under the graduated phaseout period? No Yes i. If yes, describe how the Lead Agency g radually adjusts copayments fo r families under a graduated phase out. If graduated phase out oc curs at redetermination, then the family copay amount will increase ba sed on income and family size. However, copays do not increase within a 12month eligibility period. ii. If yes, does the Lead Agency req uire additional reporting requi rements during the graduated phaseout period? (Note: Additional report ing requirements are also discussed in section 3.4.3 of the Plan.) No Yes. Describe: 3.3 Increasing Access for Vulner able Children and Families Lead Agencies are required to give priority for child care assi stance to children with special needs, which can include vulne rable populations, in families wi th very low incomes, and to children experiencing homelessne ss (658E(c)(3)(B); 98.46(a)). T he prioritization of CCDF assistance services is not limit ed to eligibility determination . Other ways to give priority may include the establishment of a waiting list or the ranking of eligible families in priority order to be served. Note: CCDF defines \"child experie ncing homelessness\" as a child who is homeless, as defined in Section 725 of Subtitle VIIB of the McKinneyVento Act (42 U.S.C. 1 1434a) (98.2). 3.3.1 Describe how a. \"Children with special needs\": Ch ildren with disabilities have special needs that are defined as conditions or characteristics of a child under the age of 19 that reflect a need for particular care, services or tre atment, most commonly physical and/or mental disabilities and/or delays and is evidenced by Individual Family Service Pla n (IFSP) or Individualized Education Program (IEP). b. \"Families with very low incomes\": A family with a very low inco me is defined as is defined as having income at or below 100 percent of the Federal Poverty Guidelines (FPG). The lead agency does not currently have a w aiting list. Should the need arise for a waiting list, the lead agency will give priority to these special populations: (1 ) Children of families with very low family income; (2) Children with special needs, including v ulnerable children; and (3) Children experiencing homelessness. 3.3.2 Identify how the Lead Agency will prioritize or target child ca re services for the following children and families: Note: If waiving copay ments is checked, Lead Agencies will nee d to provide further information in question 3.2.4. P aying higher rates for accessin g higher quality care is addressed in 4.3.3 and using gran ts or contracts to reserve spo ts is addressed in 4.1.6. a.

Describe the procedures to permit the enrollment of children ex periencing homelessness while required docu mentation is obtained. Upon ini tial eligibility determination, children eligible for subsidized child care purs uant to this subsection shall be permitted to enroll in t he subsidized child care place ment prior to completion of all required documentation and are provided a 60 calendar da y grace period in which to provide full document ation of eligibility. The Child C are Referral Form serves as acceptable documentation until the records can be provided a nd the child shall receive, and the provider shall be paid for, subsidized child c are during the grace period. If, after full documentation is provided, the child exp eriencing homelessness is found to be ineligible, subsidized child care services shall be terminated. b.

Code \u00a7 4401 et seq. T he reporting requirements are set forth in Section 500.1(c) o f OSSE's Eligibility Determinati ons for Subsidized Child Care Policy Manual and 5A DCMR \u00a7 201.6. 3.4.4 Prevent the disruption of employm ent, education, or job trainin g activities. Lead Agencies are required to have procedures and policies in p lace to ensure that parents (especially parents receiving assistance under the TANF program ) are not required to unduly disrupt their employment, education, or job training activities to comply with the Lead Agency's or designated local enti ty's requirements for the rede termination of eligibility for assistance (658E(c)(2)(N)(ii); 98.21(d)). Examples include developing stra tegies to inform families and t heir providers of an upcoming redetermination and the information that will be requi red of the family, pre populating subsidy renewal forms, having parents confirm that t he information is accurate, and/or asking only for the information necessary to make an eli gibility redetermination. In addition, states and territories can offer a variety of family friendly methods for submitting documentation for eligibility red etermination that considers th e range of needs for families in accessing support (e.g., use of languages other than English , access to transportation, accommodation of parents work ing nontraditional hours). a. Identify, where applicable, the Lead Agency's procedures and po licies to ensure that parents (especially parents receiving TANF program funds) do no t have their employment, education, or job training undul y disrupted to comply with the state/territory's or designated local entity's require ments for the redetermination of eligibility.

The eligibility staff shall ensure a letter is sent to the parent(s ) or guardian(s) that requests written documentation to update the case file, which may includ e, but is not limited to, documentation required when determined initial eligibility. During the public health emergenc y the Lead agency has allowed families with children under age 13 and who have their 12month eligibility expire dur ing the public health emergency to remain eligible for subsidized child care through out the public health emergency, until the District government enters Phase Four of t he COVID19 reopening. Families will receive a notice in the mail with a request to co me in and recertify after the public health emergency is lifted. Services for children who tu rn 13 will terminate at the next redetermination date follo wing their 13th birthday (whethe r or not the District government has entered Phase Four). 4 Ensure Equal Access to Child C are for LowIncome Children A core purpose of CCDF is to promo te parental choice and to emp ower working parents to make their own decisions regarding the child care services that best suit their family's needs. Parents have the option to choos e from centerbased care, famil y child care, or care provided in the child's own home. In suppo rting parental choice, the Lea d Agencies must ensure that families receiving CCDF funding h ave the opportunity to choose from the full range of eligible child care settings and must pr ovide families with equal access to child care that is comparable to that of nonCCDF f amilies. Lead Agencies must emp loy strategies to increase the supply and to improve the qua lity of child care services, e specially in underserved areas. In addition to generally buildin g the supply of child care for all families, this effort also supports equal access for CCDF elig ible children to the priced child care market. This section addresses strategies that the Lead Agency uses to promote parental choice, ensure equal access, and increas e the supply of child care. Not e: In responding to questions in this section, the Office of Child Care (OCC) recognizes that each state/territory identifies and defines its own categories a nd types of care. The OCC does not expect states/territories to change their defini tions to fit the CCDFdefined categories and types of care. For these questions, provide responses that closely match the CCDF catego ries of care. Note: When asked for citations, responses can in clude state sta tute, regulations, administrative rules, policy manuals or policy issuances. See the Introductio n on page 4 for more detail. 4.1 Maximize Parental Choice and Impl ement Supply Building Mechanis ms The parent(s) of each eligible c hild who receive(s) or is offer ed financial assistance for child care services has the option of either receiving a child care c ertificate or, if available, enrolling their child with a provider that has a grant or contract for pr oviding child care services (658E(c)(2)(A); 98.30(a)). Even if a parent chooses to enroll t heir child with a provider who has a grant or contract, the parent will select the provider, to th e extent practicable. If a parent chooses to use a certificate, the Lead Agency shall provide inf ormation to the parent on the range of provider options, including care by sectarian provider s and relatives. Lead Agencies must require providers chosen by families to meet health and sa fety standards and has the option to require higher standards of quality. Lead Agencies ar e reminded that any policies and procedures should not restrict parental access to any type of care or provider (e.g. center care, home care, inhome care, forprofit provider, nonprofit provider, or faithbased provider, etc.) (98.15 (a)(5)). Describe the child care certificate, including when it is issue d to parents (before or after the parent has selected a provider) and what information is included on the ce rtificate (98.16 (q)). Eligibility is determined two ways in the Distr ict. Families may go to the Dep artment of Human Services (DHS) for eligibility determination or they may go to a child development center designated as a Level II provider. A Level II provider is authorized to conduct initial eligibilit y determinations and redeterminations for families seeking child care subsid y in its center on behalf of the lead agency. No cert ificates or admission forms are needed for this proce ss. If a family chooses to go th e DHS, the child car e admission form is issued after they have selected a provider. When it has been de termined that a family meets all eligibility criteria and placem ent has been made, the eligibili ty staff issues an admission form to the parent(s) or guardian(s) with in structions to have it completed by the selected provider. The provider then returns the admission form to DHS, Child Care Services Div ision (CCSD) to confirm the child has been accepted and payment for ch ild care services will be autho rized. The provider must enter the date the child started at the facilit y and sign and date the form. T he provider returns th e admission form via email to DHS CCSD within 24 hour s after the child is enrolled a t the facility. The admission form includes the following information: type o f care (traditional or nontra ditional), child's name, parent/guardian, beginning date, child care provider, assigned copay informatio n, eligibility worker's contact information, and parent's signature. 4.1.1 Identify how the parent is informed that the child care certifi cate allows the option to choose from a variety of child care cat egories, such as private, notf Che ck all that apply. a.

Providers are also requi red to maintain this flier nea r the sign in/sign out area. 4.1.2 A core principle of CCDF is that families receiving CCDFfunded child care should have equal access to child care that is co mparable to that of nonCCDF fam ilies (658E(c)(4)(A) and 98.45(a)). a. Describe how parents have access to the full range of providers eligible to receive CCDF: District families have the opportunity to choose from a full ra nge of licensed providers including forprofit, nonprofit , and faithbased centerbased and homebased providers that accept the child care subsid y vouchers. Families are able to search for licensed childcare, browse and compare ch ild care options by location an d zip code, an d learn about available early childhood resourc es on the My Child Care DC web site. b. Describe state data on the extent to which eligible child care providers participate in the CCDF system: Over half of the District's lic ensed child development faciliti es (centers and homes) participate in the subsidized child care pr ogram in all 8 wards of the District. The District also supports relative and inhome c are options for families that are unable to find a child c are provider who meets their n eeds. c. Identify any barriers to provider participation, including barr iers related to payment rates and practices, based on provider feedback and reports to the Le ad Agency: The District has decreased barri ers to participation by increa sing subsidy reimbursement rates in FY19 based on the avera ge cost of providing child care . Barriers to participation in the District's subsidized child care program in the past were l ow reimbursement rates and late or delayed payments. Howeve r, these are no longer barriers to participation as the District significantly increased the reimbursement rates as a r esult of the increases to federal and local funding in fisc al year 2019. Furthermore, Th e Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE), has eliminated late or dela yed payments and has paid out reimbursements on time cons istently. Since October 2018, OS SE also pays a $75 initial registration fee for each subsidy eligible child. OSSE acknowle dges there may be other obstacles that may force some pr oviders to limit the number of children receiving subsidies in their care. One obstacle is t he high demand for infant and t oddler slots throughout the city. To address this, the Dist rict invested $9 million in loca l funding through the Access to Quality Child Care Fund for chi ld development facilities to inc rease the number of available infant and toddler slots by 1, 244 through September 2020. The p rogram prioritized subsidy providers (including new subsidy providers) to receive this fun ding. OSSE acknowledges that the reimbursement payment practi ces (e.g. payment based on atte ndance) may also be an obstacle that limits the number o f children receiving subsidies that some providers are able to serve. OSSE is exploring whether reimbursement payment pract ices are actual barriers to participation for District subsi dy providers, given the higher reimbursement rates and the ontime and consistent payments to providers. 4.1.3 Certify by describing the Lead Agency's procedures for ensuring that parents have unlimited access to their children whenever their children are in the car e of a provider who receives CCDF funds (658E(c)(2)(B); 98.16(t)). A licensed facility shall prov ide parents with unlimited access to their children at all ti mes, pursuant to 5A DCMR \u00a7 1 27.2. Facilities are required to establish and implement written policies that are to be provide d to parents. The written policies must include that pare nts have unlimited access to the ir children and access to all facility areas used by their child . Additionally, parents are i nformed of this policy during the parent application and orientatio n process. Providers are remin ded of this policy during the subsidy provider orientation and in the subsidy provider agreem ent. 4.1.4 The Lead Agency must allow for inhome care (i.e., care provide d in the child's own home) but may limit its use (98.16(i)( 2)). Will the Lead Agency limit the use of inhome care in any way? No Yes. If checked, what limits will the Lead Agency set on the us e of inhome care? Check all that apply. a. Restricted based on the minimum number of children in the c are of the provider to meet the Fair Labor Standards Act (minimum wage) requirements. Describe: b. Restricted based on the pr ovider meeting a minimum age re quirement. Describe: Providers are required to be at least 21 years of age. c. Restricted based on the hours of care (i.e., certain number of hours, non traditional work hours). Describe: d. Restricted to care by relativ es. (A relative provider must b e at least 18 years of age based on the definition of eligible child care provider (98.2)). Describe: e. Restricted to care for children with special needs or a m edical condition. Describe: f. Restricted to inhome provide rs that meet additional health and safety requirements beyond those required by CCDF. Describe: g. Other. Describe: Families must show that they have tried to enroll their child in care at three facilities before t he Office of the State Superin tendent of Education (OSSE) will approve an inhome care agreement. 4.1.5 Child care services available through grants or contracts. a. In addition to offering certificates, does the Lead Agency prov ide child care services through grants or contracts for child care slots (658A(b)(1))? Note: Do not check \"yes\" if every provider is simply require d to sign an agreement to be pa id in the certificate program. No. If no, skip to 4.1.7 Yes, in some jurisdictions but not statewide. If yes, describe how many jurisdictions use grants or contracts for child care slots. Yes, statewide. If yes, describe: i. How the Lead Agency ensures that parents who enroll with a prov ider who has a grant or contract have choices when selecting a provi der: ii.

Children in underserved areas viii. Children in urban areas ix. Children in rural areas x. Other populations, please specify There are no descriptions needed 4.1.6 Lead Agencies must identify shortages in the supply of highqua lity child care providers. List the data sources used to identify shortages, and describe the m ethod of tracking progress to support equal access and parental choice (98.16(x). a. In child care centers. In November 2018, the Bainum F amily Foundation, a private foundation, published Early Learning Supply and Demand , an analysis of est imated supply of and potential demand for early le arning slots by child age (e.g . infant/toddler and prek), program quality, and neighborhood in the District of Columbia. The analysis was conducted by the Reinvestment Fund with fi nancial support of the Bainum F amily Foundation and includes an accompanying interactive map allowing users to furt her analyze the data for specific ages, quality levels, populations, and communities. Th is analysis included both centerbased and homebased lic ensed child development faciliti es as well as public and private schools serving prekindergartenaged students. The ana lysis found a shortage of highquality infant and toddler s lots throughout the District a nd identified the specific geographic areas with the greatest gap between estimated supply and demand. The study is available at : https://bainumfdn.org/wpcontent /uploads/2018/10/Bainum_ELSupp ly DemandReport_FNL_Nov2018.pdf and the interactive map is available here: https://bainumfdn.org/whatwedo/earlylearning/supportingfaci lityimprovementsdc providersearlylearningqualityfund/ecmapdc/ . The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) also funded a third party research institute, the Urban Institute, to conduct a study of the supply of and demand for nontraditional hour child care in the District. This study (available at: https://www.urban.org/research/publication/nontraditionalhour childcaredistrict columbia) found that over 20 percent of children under age 12 in the Di strict have parents who work or commute nontraditiona l hours, and identify the grea test potential unmet need for nontraditionalhour care in wards 7 and 8. OSSE has used da ta and findings from both studies to inform strategies to i ncrease the supply of child ca re in the District, including the recently concluded Access to Quali ty Child Care Expansion grant , which used local funds to support expansion of child devel opment facilities to create ove r 1,200 additional infant and toddler seats. OSSE is keenly awa re that the data collected an d analyzed through both these studies is now several ye ars old, and that the public hea lth emergency has affected, and continues to affect, both t he supply of and demand for chil d care in the District in multiple ways, the longterm impacts of which are still unfoldi ng. Given this, OSSE recognizes a need for additional data collection and analysis t o identify potential shortages as the District emerges from the public health emergency. OSSE tracks changes in supply of child care facilities (due to temp orary and permanent closures as well as new openings) on an ongoing basis; regularly reviews data collected by DC Child Care Connections, the District's Child Care Resource a nd Referral agency, on vacancie s in child development facilities to identify Wards and age groups with higher and low er vacancy rates; and is working with DCChild Care Connect ions to enhance collection and analysis of data on child care demand and supply. OSSE is currently updating our internal data systems that support child care licensing, subsidy, and quality initiatives and anti cipate that this system will also enhance our ability to collect a nd analyze data on child care p articipation and vacancies. b. In child care homes . The 2018 Early Learning Supply an d Demand Report (available her e: https://bainumfdn.org/wpcontent /uploads/2018/10/Bainum_ELSupp lyDemand Report_FNL_Nov2018.pdf) and interactive map and the study of nontraditional hour care included information on demand and supply in homes, as well as center and (where applicable) schoolbased facilities. c. Other. 4.1.7 Lead Agencies are required to develop and implement strategies to increase the supply of and improve the quality of child care services (98.16 (x)). These s trategies should address children in underserved areas; infants and toddlers; children with disab ilities, as defined by the Lead Agency; and children who receive care during nontraditional ho urs. Identify what method(s) is (are) used to increase supply and/ or to improve quality for the following populations and indicate in the description if a strategy is focused more on bu ilding supply or on improving quality. a. Children in underserved areas. Check and describe all that appl y. i. Grants and contracts (as di scussed in 4.1.6). Describe: ii. Targeted Family Child Care Supports such as Family Child Care Networks. Describe: .ii. Family Child Care Networks. Describe: The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE ) established the Shared Servi ces Business Alliance (SSBA) for child devel opment homes in FY 2017 and has enrolled 47 home providers (43 percent of license d child development homes) as o f Dec. 1, 2020. SSBA is focused on facilitating a network for home providers to access best practice information and technica l assistance and to use the ec onomies of scale that result from shared business services. OSSE's grantee that manages the Quality Rating and Improvement System and Child Care Resource and Refer ral also manages SSBA, ensuring supports are aligned to quality initiati ves in the District. OSSE is currently working with t he grantee to expand access to SSBA for additional homes and small child development facilities. iii. Startup funding. Describe: iv. Technical assistance support . Describe: All child development homes and centers participating in the Dis trict's QRIS, Capital Quality, which is mandatory for Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) providers and voluntary for nonCCDF providers, receive ongoing technical assistance from quality fa cilitators (i.e. coaches) to identify resources, develop and implement strategies to impr ove program quality. All subsidized child care provid ers receive year round technica l support from the Office of the State Superintende nt of Education (OSSE) staff (e ducation service monitors, attendance coordinato rs, eligibility staff), includin g assistance with subsidy program and eligibility policy, monthly attendance submissions, and payment error corrections. OSSE also maintains a Help Desk for all early chil dhood related questions, including workforce development, licensing complianc e (e.g., required professional development), and QRIS information. Family child c are home providers participating in the Shared Serv ices Business Alliance receive oneonone support at their facility from their desi gnated child care specialist for a variety of needs including, licensing compliance and learning environment qualit y improvement. v. Recruitment of providers. Describe: vi. Tiered payment rates (as discussed in 4.3.3 ). Describe : The Office of the State Superintendent of Education ( OSSE) provides tiered reimbursement rates aligned to QRIS designations (i.e. Preliminary, Developing, Pro gressing, Quality and HighQuality) to support and incentivize highquality care and education services for children in underserved areas. Home providers participating in t he Shared Services Business Al liance (SSBA)are able to receive the highest tiere d reimbursement rate due to th e quality supports associated with membersh ip. Child care centers partici pating in OSSE's Quality Improvement Network (QIN ) also receive additional fundi ng and quality services. vii. Support for improving business pr actices, such as management tr aining, paid sick leave, and shared services. Describe: With alignment of the Quality Rating and Improvement System (QRIS) and the Shared Services Bu siness Alliance (SSBA) under one grant ee, quality facilitators (QRIS) and child care specialists (SSBA) have facilitat ed the use of the Program Admi nistration Scale (PAS) and Business Administration Scale (BAS) to improve busine ss practices. OSSE and the grantee are also in the process of expanding the S SBA to include small child development centers in addition to the child develo pment homes currently eligible to participate . Capital Quality, the District's QRIS, provides Community of Pra ctice (CoP) meetings and weekly direct one onone consultation for all par ticipating providers. CoP meetings include professional development and en gagement surrounding topics such as, staffing structure, staff professio nal development plan, and the program administra tion scale. For participating h ome providers, OSSE's SSBA provides direct busin ess practice supports that inc lude business systems development (e.g., aut omated billing) and professional development courses (e.g., basic computer lit eracy for business owners) for targeted home providers. DC Child Care Connections, the Di strict's child care resource a nd referral agency, also provides business training and supports through its Direct or's Corner and shared businessrelated informat ion and resources from communit y partners, such as the Deputy Mayor's Offi ce for Planning and Economic Dev elopment and Low Income Investment Fund (LIIF ), via an established distribut ion list. During the public health emergency, OSSE has worked with commun ity development financial institut ions (CDFIs) including LIIF and W ashington Area Community Investment Fund (Wacif) to distribute financial assis tance to child development facilities. Through these partnerships, child care providers in the District also have access to other business resources and techn ical assistance from these CDFI's including support in accessing Paycheck Prote ction Program loans, supports available from Wac if's Enterprising Women of Co lor Business Center, and information on a ccessing business capital. viii. Accreditation supports. Describe: ix. Child care health consultation. Describe: x. Mental health consultation . Describe: Children enrolled in the (Quality Improvement Network (QIN) and the PreK Enhancement classrooms have acce ss to mental heal th consultatio n via an intraagency agreement with the Department of Behavioral Health (DBH).

Through HF, child development facilities are assigne d a mental health consultant to work with on a weekly basis. DBH is working with OSSE to expand access to HF services to additional facilities in wards 7 and 8 during the FY2022 24 CCDF State Plan Period. xi. Other. Describe: The Early Head Start Child Care Partnership grant increases the supply of highquality infant and toddler care in the District by providing a model for scaling up quality improvement e fforts for infants and toddlers across the District. OSSE leveraged the Early Head StartC hild Care Partnership (EHSCCP) grant to develop the Quality Improvement Network (QIN). The QIN increases access to comprehensive child development and family support services with a particular focus in underserved areas. As part of the QIN, The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) awarded a locallyfunded grant t o a communitybased organizatio n to serve as a hub and provide technical assistance and training and coordinate co mprehensive services for a network of child development homes that primarily serve i nfants and toddlers. The hub agency supports fourteen c hild development home provide rs. The hub is supporting the network in achieving Early Head Start quality in their programs. The hub provides continuous job embedded professional development and c oaching to the staff, comprehensive services, h ealth services, support in nutr ition and wellness, as well as support to engage families in the programs. b. Infants and toddlers. Check and describe all that apply. i. Grants and contracts (as di scussed in 4.1.6). Describe: ii. Family Child Care Networks. Describe: The Office of the State Superint endent of Education (OSSE) esta blished the Shared Services Business Alliance (SSBA) for child development homes i n FY 2017 and has enrolled 47 home providers (43 pe rcent of licensed child develo pment homes) as of Dec. 1, 2020.

Recruitment of providers. Describe: vi. Tiered payment rates (as d iscussed in 4.3.3). Describe: The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE), pr ovides tiered reimbursement rates aligned to QRIS designations (i.e. Prelimin ary, Developing, Progressing, Quality and HighQuality) to support and incentivi ze highquality care and education services for infants and toddlers. Within ea ch tier, OSSE differentiates rates for infants and toddlers, preschool, and schoolaged care to reflect the difference in costs of delivery care by age. The infant and toddler tiered reimbursement rates are higher than the rates for other age groups due to the higher cost of care for infants and toddlers. Child care centers participating in OSSE's Quality Improvement Network (QIN), whic h seeks to increase the supply of highquality infant and toddler seats, a lso receive additional funding and quality services. vii.

How does the Lead Agency define areas with significant concentr ations of poverty and unemployment? . b. Describe how the Lead Agency pri oritizes increasing access to h ighquality child care and development services for childre n of families in areas that hav e significant concentrations of poverty and unemployment and that do not have access to high quality programs. The Office of the State Superint endent of Education (OSSE)'s 20 192023 strategic plan included a goal of increasing by 1,000 the number of quality sl ots available for infant and toddler care across the Distri ct. From 20192020 the District i nvested $9 million through the Access to Quality Expansion grant to increase the supply of qua lity infant and toddler supply by 1,000 by September 2020 with at least 50 percent of subgran ted amounts to improve supply for infants and toddlers eligible for subsidy. As of its conclusion in September 2020, Access to Quality had supported th e creation of 1,244 new infan t and toddler slots. In selecting child development fac ilities for subgrants, the grant ee administering the Access to Quality fund prioritized applicants serving or proposing to ser ve children of families in areas that have significant concentrations of poverty and unemploymen t and do not currently have sufficient numbers of such programs. Through the Lead Agency's public private partnership with the B ainum Foundation, the Quality Improvement Network (Q IN) expanded in March 2018 to thr ee additional centers serving 94 children in Wards 7 a nd 8, our wards with the highes t concentration of poverty and unemployment. In 2019, OSSE received federal funds to supp ort these facilities. The Bainum Family Foundation still provides professional developmen t supports to the QIN directly to the hubs. In 2017 th e Bainum Foundation established a $4.5 million Early Learning Quality Fund to support the development of 750 high qu ality infant and toddler slots in Wards 7 and 8. Now that the Access to Quality program has concluded, and in light of the impacts of the public health emergency on children, fami lies, and child care providers in the District, the District w ill need to develop new strategi es to address the ongoing needs of underserved communities in li ght of changing circumstances. As the District move through the recovery phases from the public health emergency, O SSE will work with the early care and education community, community development finan cial institutions, other units of District government, philanthropy and the private sect or to identify and implement appropriate strategies to incr ease the supply of care for child ren of families in areas that have significant concentrations of poverty and unemployment and do not have access to highquality programs, recognizing that the needs of these comm unities may have changed as a result of the public health emergency. 4.2 Assess Market Rates and Anal yze the Cost of Child Care Key principles of the CCDF are t o: (1) provide equal access to child care for children receiving child care assistance; and (2) en sure parental choice by offeri ng a full range of child care services. Payment rates that ar e too low to support equal acce ss undermine these principles. To establish subsidy payment rates that ensure equa l access, Lead Agencies collect and analyze data through a number of tools. Lead Agenci es have the option to conduct a statistica lly valid and reliable (1) market rate surv ey (MRS) reflecting variations in the price to parents of child ca re services by geographic area, type of provider, and age of child or (2) an ACF preapproved alternative methodology, such as a cost estimation model (658E(c)(4)(B)). A cost estimation model estimates the cost of care by incorporating both data and assumptions to judge what expected costs would be incu rred by child care providers and parents under different scenarios. Another approa ch would be a cost study that collects cost data at the f acility or program level to mea sure the costs (or inputs used) to deliver child care servic es (CCDFACF PI201801). Regardless of whether Lead Agencies conduct a market rate surve y or an alternative methodology, they are required t o analyze the cost of providing child services, known as the narrow cost analysis, that meet b asic health, safety, quality a nd staffing requirements (base level care) (98.45(b)(3), (f)(1)(ii)(A), and (f)(2)(ii)), and h igherquality care at each level of quality, as defined by the Lead Agency (98.45(b)(4), (f)(1)(ii) (B), and (f)(2)(iii)). The analysis must identify the gaps between the cost of care and subsidy lev els adopted by the state and then be considered as part o f the rate setting process. Note: Any Lead Agency considerin g using an alternative methodol ogy, instead of a market rate survey, is required to submit a description of its propose d approach to its ACF Regional Child Care Program Office for p reapproval in advance of the Pl an submittal (see https://www.acf.hhs.gov/occ/resource/ccdfacfpi201608 ) . Advance approval is not required if the Lead Agency plans to implement both a market ra te survey and an alternative methodology. In its request for ACF preapproval, a Lead Agency must: Provide an overview of the Lead Agency's proposed approach (e.g ., cost estimation model, cost study/survey, etc.), includi ng a description of data sourc es. Describe what information the Lead Agency will obtain from an a lternative methodology that could not be ob tained from the required narrow cost analysis. Describe how the Lead Agency will consult with the State Early Childhood Advisory Council or similar coordinating body, local child care program administrators, local child care resource and referral agenci es, organizations representing child care caregivers, teachers and directors, and other appropriate entities prior to conducting the identified alternative methodology. Describe how the alternative methodology will use methods that are statistically valid and reliable and will yield accura te results. For example, if u sing a survey, describe how the Lead Agency will ensure a representative sample and promote an adequate response rate. If using a cost estimation model, describe how the Lead A gency will validate the assumptions in the model. If the proposed alternative meth odology includes an analysis of costs (e.g., cost estimation model or cost study/survey), describe how the altern ative methodology will account for key factors that impa ct the cost of providing care, such as: staff salaries and benefits, training and professional development, curricula and supplies, group size and ratios, enrollment levels, licensing requirements, quality leve l, facility size, and other factors. Describe how the alternative met hodology will provide complete information that captures the universe of providers in the child care market. Describe how the alternative methodology will reflect variation s by provider type, age of children, geographic location, and quality. Describe how the alternative methodology will use current data. What metrics the Lead Agency will use to set rates based on the alternative methodology. Describe the estimated reporti ng burden and cost to conduct the approach. A Market Rate Survey (MRS) or an ACF preapproved alternative m ethodology must be developed and conducted no earlier than 2 years before the date of submission of the Plan (658E(c)(4)(B)(i) (98.45 (c)). Due to the COVID19 pandemic, Le ad Agencies may request a waiver for up to one additional year (until July 1, 2022) to co mplete the required MRS or an ACF pre approved alternative met hodology. Lead Agencies may al so request the required Narrow Cost Analysis be waived for one year (until July 1, 2022 ). These waiver requests must include a justification linked to the COVID19 pandemic. 4.2.1 Completion of the MRS or ACF pre approved alternative methodolo gy. Did the state/territory conduct a statistically valid and relia ble MRS or ACF pre approved alternative methodology? Yes. If yes, please identify the methodology(ies) used below to assess child care prices and/or costs. a. MRS. When was your data gathered (provide a date range, for instance, September - December, 2019)? b. ACF preapproved alternative methodology. Identify the date of the ACF approval and describe the metho dology: On April 15, 2021, the A CF approved the District's request to use an alternative methodolo gy to establish subsidy payment rates. As provided in the Office of t he State Superintendent of Educatio n's (OSSE's) request, OSSE is i n the process of updating its 2018 Cost Estimation Model that was developed in consultation with n ationally recognized early chil dhood finance experts. The model includes the cost of delivering serv ices at each level of the District's Quality Rating and Improvement Sys tem (QRIS), Capital Quality, in center and homebased settings that serve children of varying ages and needs. The goals of the alternativ e methodology are to: 1) identify key cost drivers that cut acros s all QRIS designations and age groups ; 2) carefully explore differen tial costs between programs based on size, ages of children served, and other factors; 3) assess the fisc al impact of various policies (e.g. licensing requirements, minimum wage increases) and participati on in different programs and funding streams (e.g. Quality Improve ment Network, the PreK Enhancement and Expansion Program(PKEEP), the Child and Adult Care Food Pro gram (CACFP)) on provider cost s and revenues; 4) understand the impact of new health and safety protocols and group si zes on provider costs and revenues during the public health emergency and 5) use this information to test a r ange of alternative ratesetting and policy recommendations with a c lear understanding of the fiscal impact of these decisions. OSSE requested to use the same, but updated, model because the Distr ict was able to use the results from the 2018 cost estimation model to inform rate setting and make targeted and meaningful investment s in supporting providers' financial sustainability. No, a waiver is being requested in Appendix A. a. Please identify the Lead Agency's planned methodology(ies) to a ssess child care prices and/or costs. i. MRS. If checked, describe the status of the Lead Agency's im plementation of the MRS. ii. ACF preapproved alternative methodology. If checked, descr ibe the status of the Lead Agency's implementation of the ACF preapproved alternative methodology, includi ng if applicable , the date of t he ACF approval and a description of the methodology: The Administrati on for Children and Families approved the District's Alternative Metho dology approach on April 15, 2021. The D istrict developed an interacti ve model of the actual cost of delivering child care services. This inte ractive model takes into acco unt the different levels of quality of the District's Quality Rating and Improvement System (QRIS) in the universe of child care providers in the District, including child development cen ters and homes serving children of varyi ng ages and needs. The cost esti mation model adapts the Provi der Cost of Quality Ca lculator (PCQC), a dynamic, webbased tool that calculates t he cost of quality child care b ased on sitelevel provider data. The PC QC relies on Excel spreadsheets that are aligned to the District's unique reimbursement rate variations, including a range of quality and other funding factors. b. If a waiver is requested, Lead Agencies will need to respond to questions 4.2.24.5.2 based on data co llected for the FY 20192021 CCDF P lan. Identify the date of the Lead Ag encies' most recent and complet e Market Rate Survey or ACF preapp roved alternative methodology that will provide data to inform respo nses to questions 4.2.2-4.5.2. Click or tap here to enter text. 4.2.2 Prior to developing and conducting the MRS, or conducting the A CF preapproved alternative methodology, the Lead Agency is required to consult with (1) th e State Advisory Council or similar coordinating body, local child care program administrat ors, local child care resource and referral agencies, and other appropriate entities, and (2) organizations representing caregivers, teachers, and direct ors (98.45 (e)). Local child ca re program administrators may also be good informants to Lead Agencies on narrow cost analyse s. Describe how the Lead Agen cy consulted with the: a. State Advisory Council or similar coordinating body: On Jan. 28 , 2021, the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) consulted with the State Ear ly Childhood Development Coordinating Council ( SECDCC) and received approval to request the Administration for Children and Families (\u0000ACF)\u0000 appr oval to use an alternative me thodology based on the District's Child Care Cost Est imation Model for the FY202224 C CDF State Plan. In March 2021, OSSE consulted with SECDCC me mbers and sought input to in form the assumptions in the model, and in May 2021 OSSE will present a draft of the com pleted model to the SECDCC for further revi ew and feedback. b. Local child care program administrators: The District of Columbia d oes not have a separate local administrator of child car e programs, the Office of the S tate Superintendent of Education (OSSE) is both the lo cal and state administrator. c. Local child care resource and referral agencies: The Child Care Resource and Referral Agency for the state is a member of the State Early Childhood Developm ent Coordinating Council (SECDCC) and the Distr ict's Child Care Recovery Working Group a nd has provided a review and input into the Office of the State Superintendent of Educat ion's (OSSE's) alternative methodology. d. Organizations representing caregi vers, teachers, and directors: The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (O SSE) conducted focu s groups with representatives of organizations representing careg ivers, teachers, and directors, including the District of Columbia Association for the Educ ation of Young Children, Direc tor's Exchange, D.C. Head Start Association, D.C . Family Child Care Association, Multilin gual Spanish Speaking Providers Association, and D.C. Action, as well as conducting f ollowup conversations with individual program leaders to solicit additional information an d feedback on key assumptions or data points. OSSE also reviewed the cost model a nd ingoing assumptions with the D.C. Child Care Recove ry Working Group, a working grou p of child development facility leaders representing t he diversity of settings within the District's child care ecosystem that OSSE co nvened in Summer 2020 to advise OSSE in p lanning for and supporting child care facilities in reopening and recovery foll owing COVIDrelated closures, and whom OSSE continues to engage as an informal advisory on ke y policy, programmatic, and other questions facing the agency and child development fac ilities. e. Other. Describe: 4.2.3 ACF has established a set of benchmarks, largely based on resea rch, to identify the components of a valid and reliable market rate survey (81 FR, p. 67509). To be considered valid and reliable a Market Rate Survey or alternat ive methodology meets the follo wing: o represents the child care market o provides complete and current data o uses rigorous data collection procedures o reflects geographic variations o analyzes data in a manner that captures other relevant differe nces An MRS can use administrative data, such as child care resource and referral data, if it is representative of the market. a. Describe how each of the benchma rks are met in either the MRS o r ACF pre approved alternative methodology. i. Represent the child car e market: The District's cost estimation model is designed to be inclusive of the universe of providers in the District's child care market and to reflect variations by provider type, age of children, and quality. The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE ) Division of Early Learning ( DEL) will separately model the costs for the three types of licensed providers that exist in the District: child development centers, child devel opment homes, and child develop ment expanded homes. Each model takes into acc ount the unique operating condi tions and variation in cost drivers of these different p roviders. Within the models fo r each provider type, we also develop a variety of scenar ios that reflect variation in p rovider size (number of children served); ages of childre n served (birth to five, infan ts and toddlers only, preschool only, schoolaged, and birthtofive and schoolaged) ; and quality level (based on the District's Quality Rating and Improvement System (QRIS) ratings) and participation in different programs and revenue streams. The dynamic nature o f the model enables us to program assumptions about cost and revenue drivers that can then be programmed to vary based on these factors, as w ell as to include fixed costs and calculate variations in fixed, marginal, and total costs per child under different scen arios. ii. Provide complete and current data: The District's 2021 Cost E stimation Model uses complete and current data from a variety of sources. Revenue da ta include District's current and proposed subsidy reimbursement rates, reimbursement rates for the CACFP program, and Uniform Per Student Funding Formula. Cost data inc lude data from District of Columbia's current minimum wag e, most recent salary informat ion from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Occupatio nal Employment Statistics, Dist rict of Columbia Public Schools Salary Schedule, and data on facilities costs from Low Income Investment Fund. Assumptions and data on nonpers onnel costs, such as supplies, equipment, rent, or mortgage payments and food were updated with consultation from the District's child care providers; other District government agencies, and nationa l and local experts, such as BUILD, Opportunities Exchange, and the Low Income Investment Fund. iii. Use rigorous data collection procedures: The Office of the Stat e Superintendent of Education ( OSSE) used data from public sourc es that use rigorous data coll ection and quality control measures (such as BLS data) and consulted with child care providers and national experts to validate and refine all assumptions incorpo rated into the model. This consultation process included mul tiple focus groups with groups of child care providers representing the universe of child care in the District, as wel l as followup to collect more detailed information on specific data points raised in these co nversations. iv. Reflect geographic variations: N/A the District of Columbia h as only one geographic area v. Analyze data in a manner that c aptures other relevant differenc es: The District of Columbia Cost Estimation Model i s a flexible financial model th at allows inputs to be adjusted to test a wide varie ty assumptions and scenarios. T hrough testing different assumptions, we are able to analyze the fiscal impact of a wide variety of policies, programs (e.g. particip ation in the PreK Enhancement and Expansion Program (PKEEP) or the Quality Im provement Network (QIN)), prov ider business models, and operating conditions, including the impact of poten tial differences in providers' operating circumstance s, enrollment, and costs as a result of the public health emergency. b. Given the impact of COVID19 on the child care market, do you t hink that the data you gathered (as indicated in 4. 2.1) on the prices or costs of child care adequately reflect the child care market as you submit this plan? No Yes. If yes, why do you think th e data represents the child car e market? The District of Columbia Cost Estimation Model i s a flexible financial model th at allows inputs to be adjusted to test a wide variety assumptions and scenarios, incl uding the impact of potential differences in providers' operating circumstances, en rollment, and costs as a result of the public health emergency. The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) is in ongoing dialogue with child development facility leaders, including leaders of center and homebas ed facilities, about how the pub lic health emergency is impacting their programs' enrollm ent, costs, finances, staffing , and family and staff well being, among other topics. 4.2.4 Describe how the market rate sur vey or ACF preapproved alterna tive methodology reflects variations in the price or cost of child care services by: a. Geographic area (e.g., statewide or local markets). Describe: N /A the District of Columbia has only one geographic area b. Type of provider. Describe: The District's cost estimation mode l separately models the costs for the three types of lic ensed providers that exist in t he District: child development centers, child development homes , and child development expande d homes. c. Age of child. Describe: Within the models for each provi der type, the District's Child Care Cost Estimation Model also devel op a variety of scenarios that reflect variation in ages of children served (e.g. birth to fi ve, infants and toddlers only, preschool only, schoolaged, and birthtofive and schoolage d) and reflect differences in g roupsizes, adult:child ratios, and other regulatory require ments related to child age. Describe any other key variation s examined by the market rate s urvey or ACF pre approved alternative methodology, such as quality level. In add ition to variations by provider type and children's age s, the District' s cost estimati on model reflect variations by provider quality (as measured th rough Capital Quality, the Dist rict's tiered Quality Rating Improvement System (QRIS)), size, and participation in differen t programs and revenue streams (including the PreK Enha ncement and Expansion Program (PKEEP), the Quality Improvement Network (QIN), and the Child and Adult Care Food Pr ogram (CACFP). 4.2.5 Has the Narrow Cost Analysis b een completed for the FY 2022 - 2 024 CCDF Plan? No, a waiver is being requested in Appendix A. If no, describe the status of the Lead Agency's upcoming na rrow cost analysis. Yes, the narrow cost analysis information is included in the re port as described in 4.2.6. If yes, describe how the State/Territory analyzed the co st of child care through a narrow cost analysis for the FY 2022 - 2024 CCDF Plan, includ ing: a. The methodology the Lead Agency used to conduct, obtain, and an alyze data on the estimated cost of care (na rrow cost analysis), including any relevant variation by geographic location, category of provider, or age of child (98.45 (f)(ii)). b. How the methodology ad dresses the cost of child care providers' implementation of health, safety, quality and staffing requirem ents (i.e. applicable licensing and regulatory requirements, health and sa fety standards, training and professional development standards, and appropriate child to staff ratio, groups size limits, and caregiver qualifi cation requirements (98.45 (f)(ii)(A)). c. How the methodology ad dresses the cost of higherquality care, as defined by the Lead Agency using a quality rating and improvement system o r other system of quality indicators, at e ach level of quality (98.45 ( f)(ii)(B)). d. The gap between costs incurred by child care providers and the Lead Agency's payment rates based on findings from the narrow cost a nalysis. The Narrow Cost Analysis is still in progress and the analysis report and the Alternative Methodology will be published at a later date. 4.2.6 After conducting the market rate survey or ACF preapproved alt ernative methodology, the Lead Agency must prepare a detailed report containing the resul ts of the MRS or ACF pre approved alternative methodology . The detailed report must also include the Narrow Cost Analysis, as described in 4.2.5, which estimates the cost of ca re (including any relevant variation by geographic location, category of provider, or age of child) necessary to support (1) child care providers' implementation of the health, safety, quality, and staffing requirements, and (2) higher quality care, as defined by the L ead Agency using a quality rating and improvement system or other system of quality indica tors, at each level of quality. For states without a QRIS or for a state with a QRIS s ystem that is currently limited to only certain providers, those states may use other quality i ndicators (e.g. provider status related to accreditation, PreK st andards, Head Start performanc e standards, schoolage quality standards, or state defined quality measures.) The Lead Agency must make the re port with these results widely available no later than 30 days after completion of the rep ort, including posting the resu lts on the Lead Agency website. The Lead Agency must describe in the detailed report h ow the Lead Agency took into consideration the views a nd comments of the public or stak eholders. Describe how the Lead Agency made the results of the market rat e survey or ACF pre approved alternative methodology report widely available to the public (98.45(f)(1)) by responding to the questions below. a. Date the report containing resul ts was made widely available\u2014no later than 30 days after the completion of the report. The Office of the State Superint endent of Education (OSSE) is w orking to update the District of Columbia Cost Estimation Mode l, the District's approved alte rnative methodology, and is engaging stakeholders and national experts to inform these effo rts. As a result, this draft Child Care and Development Fund ( CCDF) plan does not include re sponses to most questions in section 4.2. However, we welcome input and feedbac k from stakeholders on the District's approach to analyzing the cost of child care. b. Describe how the Lead Agency made the detailed report containin g results widely available and provide the link where the report is posted. The Office of the State Superint endent of Education (OSSE) is w orking to update the District of Columbia Cost Estimation Mode l, the District's approved alte rnative methodology, and is engaging stakeholders and national experts to inform these effo rts. As a result, this draft CCDF plan does not include respons es to most questions in secti on 4.2. However, we welcome input and feedback from stakeholders on the District's approach to analyzing the cost of child care. c. Describe how the Lead Agency considered stakeholder views and c omments in the detailed report. The Office of the State S uperintendent of Education (OSSE) is working to update the District of Columbia Cost Estimation Mode l, the District's approved alte rnative methodology, and is engaging stakeholders and national experts to inform these effo rts. As a result, this draft Child Care and Development Fund ( CCDF) plan does not include re sponses to most questions in section 4.2. However, we welcome input and feedbac k from stakeholders on the District's approach to analyzing the cost of child care. 4.3 Establish Adequate Payment Rates The Lead Agency must s et CCDF subsidy payment rates, in accorda nce with the results of the current MRS or ACF preapproved alternative methodology, as ide ntified in 4.2.1, at a level to ensure equal access for elig ible families to child care serv ices that are comparable with those provided to families not receiving CCDF assistance. Lead Agencies must also consider the costs of base and higher qua lity care at each level as part of its rate setting. The Lead Agency must re evaluate its pay ment rates at least every 3 yea rs. 4.3.1 Provide the base payment rates and percentiles (based on the mo st recent MRS as identified in 4.2.1) for the following categories below. Lead Agencies are required to provide a summary of data and facts in their Plan to demonstrate how its payment rates ensure equal access. The preamble to the final rule (81 FR , p. 67512), indicates that a benchmark for adequate payment rates is the 75th percentile of the most recent MRS. The 75th percentile is the number separating the lowest 75 percent of rates from the highest 25 p ercent. Setting rates at the 75th percentile, while not a requirement, would ensure that eligible children have access to three out of four child care slots. The 75th percentile benchmark applies to the base rates. Base rates are the lowest, foundational rates before any differentials are added (e.g., fo r higher quality or other purposes). Further, base rates must be sufficient to ensure that minimum health and safety and staffing requirements are covered. Percentiles are not required if the Lead Agency conducted an AC F preapproved alternative methodology, but must be reported if the Lead Agency conducted a MRS. For states that conduct an ACF preapproved alter native methodology, report the base payment rates based on a fulltime weekly rate. The ages and types of care listed below are meant to provide a snapshot of the categories on which rates can be based and are not intended to be comprehensi ve of all categories that might exist or to reflect the terms used by the Lead Agency for particular ages. If rates are not statewide, please use the most p opulous geographic region (defi ned as the area serving highest number of CCDF children) t o report base payment rates b elow. a. Fill in the table below based on either the statewide rates or the most populous area of the state (area serving highest number of children accessing CC DF). To facilitate compiling state by state payment rates, provide the full time w eekly base payment rates in the table below. If weekly payment rates are not published the n the Lead Agency will need to calculate its equivalent. The below published rates do not affect potential changes that may occur as a result of stakeholder feedback or the upda tes to the D.C. Cost Estimation Model. Age of child in what type of licensed child care setting. (All rates are full time) Base payment rate Fulltime weekly base payment rate If the Lead Agency conducted an MRS, what is the percentile of the base payment rate? If the Lead Agency used an alternative methodology what percent of the estimated cost of care is the base rate? Infant (6 months) Center care $65.43 (day) $327.15 N/A To be completed when D.C. Cost Estimation Model updates are completed Toddler (18 months) Center care $65.43 (day) $327.15 N/A To be completed when D.C. Cost Estimation Model updates are completed Preschooler (4 years) Center care $48.87 (day) $244.35 N/A To be completed when D.C. Cost Estimation Model updates are completed Schoolage child (6 years) Center care (Based on fullday, fullyear rates that would be paid during the summer.) N/A To be completed when D.C. Cost Estimation Model updates are completed Infant (6 months) Family Child Care $50.46 (day) $252.30 N/A To be completed when D.C. Cost Estimation Model updates are completed Toddler (18 months) $50.46 (day) $252.30 N/A To be completed when D.C. Cost Estimation Model updates are completed Age of child in what type of licensed child care setting. (All rates are full time) Base payment rate Fulltime weekly base payment rate If the Lead Agency conducted an MRS, what is the percentile of the base payment rate? If the Lead Agency used an alternative methodology what percent of the estimated cost of care is the base rate? Family Child Care Preschooler (4 years) Family Child Care $30.84 (day) $154.20 N/A To be completed when D.C. Cost Estimation Model updates are completed Schoolage child (6 years) Family Child Care (Based on fullday, fullyear rates that would be paid during the summer.) N/A To be completed when D.C. Cost Estimation Model updates are completed b. If the Lead Agency does not pub lish weekly rates then how were these rates calculated (e.g., were daily rates multiplie d by 5 or monthly rates divide d by 4.3)? Rates were calculated by multiplying by 5 the current daily rates set in D CMR 5A203.2. These are the rates for a child development fa cility at the \"developing\" leve l, which is the lowest rating in the District's tiered Quality Ra ting and Improvement System (QR IS). During the public health emergency, the Office of the State Superintendent of Edu cation (OSSE) has implemented a public health emergency rate that increases daily perchild subsidy rates paid to child development facilit ies participating in the Distr ict's child care subsidy program by a fixed percentage ca lculated under a formula establ ished in DCMR 5A203.13 17. This temporary increase in subsidy payment rates, which wil l remain in effect through the duration of the public health emergency, is not reflected i n the rates above. i. Describe how the Lead Agency defines and calculates parttime a nd fulltime care. Full Time Traditional: between 6 and 11 hours of care Part Time Tradition al: less than 6 hours of care. c. d. Provide the date these current payment rates became effective ( i.e., date of last update based on most rec ent MRS as reported in 4.2.1). Oct. 1, 2018 e. If applicable, identify the most populous area of the state (ar ea serving highest number of children accessing CCDF) used to co mplete the responses above. N/A the District of Columbia has only one geographic area f. Provide the citation, or link, if available, to the payment rat es Click If the payment rates are not set by the Lead Agency for the ent ire state/territory, describe how many juri sdictions set their own payment rates (98 .16(i)(3)). N/A the Lead Agency sets the rates for the entire state 4.3.2 Describe how and on what factors the Lead Agency differentiates payment rates. Check all that apply. a. Geographic area. Describe: b. Type of provider. Child care provider payment rates are diff erentiated by home or center, or relative and inhome care. Describe: c. Age of child. Child care provider payment rates are differen tiated by the age of the child: infant and toddler (6 weeks to 2 years 11 months), pres chool (ages 3 and 4) and school age (age 5 through 12 years 11 months). Describe: d. Quality level. Child care provider payment rates are differe ntiated by the quality tier designation assigned in the Capital Quality Quality Rating Impr ovement System (QRIS) program. Describe: e. Other. Payment rates are also differentiated by the amount o f time a provider cares for a child, parttime, fulltime , extended day, or nontraditio nal, as well as for children with special needs. Describe: 4.3.3 Lead Agencies can choose to establish tiered rates, differentia l rates, or addons on top of their base rates as a way to increase payment rates for targete d needs (i.e., a higher rate for special needs children as both an incentive for providers t o serve children with special needs and as a way to cover the higher costs to the provider to provide care for special needs children). Lead Agencies may pay providers more than thei r private pay rates as an incentive or to cover costs for higher quality care (81 FR, p. 67514). Has the Lead Agency chosen to implement tiered reimbursement or differential rates? No Yes, If yes, identify below any tiered or differential rates, a nd at a minimum, indicate the process and basis used for d etermining the tiered rates, in cluding if the rates were based on the MRS or an ACF preapproved alternative metho dology. Check and describe all that apply. a. Tiered or differential rates are not implemented. b. Differential rate for nont raditional hours. Describe: c. Differential rate for children with special needs, as defi ned by the state/territory. Describe: d. Differential rate for infants and toddlers. Note: Do not che ck if the Lead Agency has a different base rate for infants/toddlers with no s eparate bonus or addon. Describe: e. Differential rate for schoolage programs. Note: Do not chec k if the Lead Agency has a different base rate for schoolage children with n o separate bonus or add on. Describe: f. Differential rate for higher quality, as defined by the s tate/territory. Describe: g. Other differential rates or tiered rates. Describe: Child development facilities that participate in the Quality Improvement Network (QIN) recei ve an enhanced reimbursement rate reflecting QIN participation. 4.3.4 Establishment of ade quate payment rates. Describe how base payment rates are adequate and enable provide rs to meet health, safety, quality, and staffing requirements under CCDF, and how they were establi shed based on the most recent MRS or ACF preapproved alterna tive methodology and the Narrow Cost Analysis, as reported in 4.2.1 and 4.2.5.. In determining compliance with the Act for th e equal access provisions in the FY20192021 CCDF Plan, the OCC review ed all the states with pay ment rates below the 75th percentile benchmark. Of those states, the half with the lowest payment rates were considered non compliant and placed on a corrective action plan (CAP). These s tates all had rates below the 25th percentile for either some or all categories of care. The 25th percentile is not to be viewed as a benchmark or a longterm solution to gauge equal access. It is also not to be viewed as sufficient for compliance in future plan cycles. OCC expects to continue to ta ke action against states with the lowest rates in future plan cycles in an effort to keep payment rates moving upward toward ensuring equal access. Note: Per the preamble (81 FR p. 67512), in insta nces where an MRS or ACF pre approved alternative methodology indicates that prices or costs have increased, Lead Agencies must raise their rates as a result. a. Describe the process used for setting rates, including how the Lead Agency factors in the cost of care, including any increased costs and provider fees b ecause of COVID19, and how such costs may be modified afte r the pandemic subsides. This question will be answered fo llowing completion of the Dist rict's updated Child Care Cost Estimation Model. Stakeholders are encouraged to provide input and feedback to inform completion of this section. 4.3.5 Describe how the Lead Agency took the cost of higher quality, a s determined in 4.2.5, into account, including how payment rates for higherquality care, a s defined by the Lead Agency using a QRIS or other system of quality indicators, relate to t he estimated cost of care at each level of quality. Note: For states without a QRIS, the states m ay use other quality indicators (e.g. provider status related to accreditation, PreK standards, Head Start performance standards, or statedefined quality measures). This question will be answered fo llowing completion of the Dist rict's updated Child Care Cost Estimation Model. Stakeholders are encouraged to provide input and feedback to inform completion of this section. 4.3.6 Identify and describe any additional facts that the Lead Agency considered in determining its payment rates ensure equal access. If applicable, provide a description of how any additional health and safety costs, because of the COVID19 pan demic are included in rate setting. This question will be answered fo llowing completion of the Dist rict's updated Child Care Cost Estimation Model. Stakeholders are encouraged to provide input and feedback to inform completion of this section. 4.4 Implement Generally Accepted Pay ment Practices and Ensure Timel iness of Payments Lead Agencies are required to demonstrate that they have establ ished payment practices applicable to all CCDF child care providers that include ensuri ng the timeline ss of payments by either (1) paying prospectivel y prior to the delivery of ser vices or (2) paying within no more than 21 calendar days of the receipt of a complete invoice for services. To the extent practicable, the Lead Agency mus t also support the fixed costs of providing child care services by delinking provider payments from a child's occasional absenc es by (1) paying based on a child's enrollment rather than a ttendance, (2) providing full p ayment if a child attends at least 85 percent of the authorized time , (3) providing full payment i f a child is absent for 5 or fewer days in a month, or (4) using an alternative approach for which the Lead Agency provides a justification in its Plan (658E(c)(2)(S)(ii); 98.45(l)(2)). Lead Agencies are required to use CCDF payment practices that r eflect generally accepted payment practices of child care providers who serve children wh o do not receive CCDF funded assistance. Unless a Lead Agency is able to demonstrate that the following policies are not generally accepted in its particular state, territory, or service area or among particular categories or types of providers, Lead Agencies must (1) pay pr oviders based on established parttime or fulltime rates rat her than paying for hours of se rvice or smaller increments of time and (2) pay for reasonable, mandatory registration fees th at the provider charges to privatepaying parents (658E(c)( 2)(S); 98.45(l)(3)). Responses may also identify any additional health and safety fees providers are charging as a result of CO VID19. In addition, there are certain other generally accepted payment practices that are required. Lead Agencies are required to ensure that child care providers receive payment for any services in accordance with a payment agreement or an authoriza tion for services, ensure that child care providers receiv e prompt notice of changes to a family's eligibility status that could impact payment, and establish timely appeal and resolutio n processes for any payment inaccuracies identifying and describing the payment practices bel ow that the Lead Agency has implemented for all CCDF child care providers. a. Ensure the timeliness of payment s by either (Lead Agency to imp lement at least one of the following): i. Paying prospectively prior to the delivery of services. Desc ribe the policy or procedure. ii. Paying within no more than 21 calendar days of the receipt of a complete invoice for services. Describe the policy or procedure. Invoices are due by the fifth business day of the month for services rendered the previous month and payme nts are issued the last week of the month (approxima tely 1015 days between receip t of invoice and issued payment). b. To the extent practicable, support the fixed costs of providing child care services by delinking provider payments from a child's occasional absences by: Note: The Lead Agency is to choose at least one of the following: I. Paying based on a child's enrollment rather than attendance. Describe the policy or procedure. . ii. Providing full payment if a c hild attends at least 85 perce nt of the authorized time. Describe the policy or procedure. . iii. Providing full payment if a c hild is absent for 5 or fewer days in a month. Describe the policy or procedure. Per the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) policy, providers are paid for 5 unexcused absences and 15 excu sed absences each month and 15 days of vacation a nnually per child. No documentat ion is required to support the unexcused absences. E xcused absences must be accomp anied by a doctor's note submitted with the monthly invoice. During the public heal th emergency, OSSE has increased the number of unexcused absences for which providers may be paid to 10 absences. iv. Use an alternative approach for which the Lead Agency provi des a justification in its Plan. If chosen, please describe the policy or procedure and th e Lead Agency's justification for this approach. . c. The Lead Agency's payment practices reflect generally accepted payment practices of child care providers who serve children who do not receive CCDF subsi dies. These payment practices must include the follo wing two practices unless the L ead Agency provides evidence that such practices are not generally accepted in its state (65 8E(c)(2)(S); 98.45(l)(3)). i. Paying on a parttime or fulltime basis (rather than paying fo r hours of service or smaller increments of time). Describe the policy or procedure and inclu de a definition of the time increments (e.g., part time, fulltime). Children are assigned to fulltime or parttime traditional, extended day, or non traditional services, depend ing on need for care. Hours are as follows: Full Time Traditional: between 6 and 11 hours o f care Part Time Traditional: less than 6 hours of care. ii. Paying for reasonable mandatory registration fees that the prov ider charges to private paying parents. Describe the policy or procedure. Child development providers are only able to charge parents the copayment established by the lead a gency and any late fees incurred by parents/guardians who do not pick their children up on time. The provider is not allowed to collect any other fees from the parent/guardian, and collection of fees will result in the termination of the subsidized child care agr eement. Since Oct. 1, 2018, the Office of the State Superint endent of Education (OSSE) has paid a $75 initial registration fee for children rece iving subsidies to reflect th e payment policies and practices of nonChild Care and Development Fund (CCDF) provide rs. d. The Lead Agency ensures that providers are paid in accordance w ith a written payment agreement or an authorization for services that includes, at a minimum, information regarding provider payment policies, including rates, schedules , any fees charged to providers, including fees relate d to COVID 19, and the dispute resolution process. Describe: All child development facilities w ho participate in the subsidi zed child care program sign an annual agreement. The agreement details the fol lowing: general requirements for the provision of care and financial management requirements; attendance reporting and payment policies; reimbursement rates; sliding fee scale for parent copayments; payment reconciliation and error reporting process for incorrect payments received; Quality Rating and Improvement System (QRIS) requirements; and disputeresolution process. e. The Lead Agency provides prompt notice to providers regarding a ny changes to the family's eligibility status that could imp act payments, and such a notic e is sent no later than the day that the Lead Agency becomes aware that such a change will occu r. Describe: The Department of Human Services (DHS) conducts subsidized child care eligibil ity on behalf of the lead agency. DHS notifies the providers of a family's eligibility status, su ch as when a family's child care services are terminated at the 12month redetermination period . f. The Lead Agency has a timely appeal and resolution process for payment inaccuracies and disputes. Describe: The Provider Agreement for Subsidized Child Care Services details the policies and procedures for dispu te resolution and appeals. If informal dispute resolution attempts are unsuccessful, providers are able to submit a writt en statement and the Assistant Superintendent of Early Learning will render a decisi on within 30 days. The provider may appeal the decision within 15 days. The Superinten dent has 30 days to reconsider and render a new decision . g. Other. Describe: . 4.4.2 Do payment practices vary across regions, counties, and/or geog raphic areas? No, the practices do not vary across areas. Yes, the practices vary across areas. Describe: . 4.4.3 Describe how Lead Agencies' payment practices described in subs ection 4.4 support equal access to a full range of providers. Providers are paid based on a child's monthly attendance, including 5 unexcused absences per month. Children are allowed 15 excused absences per month, with supporting documentation, as w ell as 5 unexcused absences per month. Additionally , families are given 15 days of vacation annually. During the public health emergency, providers may be paid for u p to 10 unexcused absences per month per child. The Lead Agency is exploring alte rnative payment practices that may be more provider friendly, such as paying b ased on enrollment rather than attendance and/or de veloping grants or contracts fo r subsidized slots. 4.5 Establish Affordable CoPayments Family copayments are addressed in Section 3 related to minimu m 12month eligibility and the graduated phaseout provision and also in this subsection, because they are an important element for determining equal access. If a Lead Agency allows p roviders to charge amounts more than the required family copayments, the Lead Agency must provide a rationale for this practice, including how charging such additional amounts w ill not negatively impact a family's ability to receive care t hey might otherwise receive, taking into consideration a family's co payment and the provider's payment rate. 4.5.1 How will the Lead Agency ensure t hat the family contribution/co payment, based on a sliding fee scale, is affordable and is not a barrier to famil ies receiving CCDF services (98.16 (k))? Check all that apply. a. Limit the maximum copayment per family. Describe: The copayment is applied only to the 2 youngest children receiv ing subsidy and does not excee d 7 percent of a family's income. The copayment is only applied to family incom es above 100 percent of FPL. b. Limit the combined amount of copayment for all children to a percentage of family income. List the percenta ge of the copayment limit and describe. . c. Minimize the abrupt termination of assistance before a famil y can afford the full cost of care (\"the cliff effe ct\") as part of the graduated phaseout of assistance in 3.2.5. Describe: . d. Other. Describe: . 4.5.2 Does the Lead Agency choose the option to allow providers to ch arge families additional amounts above the required copayment in instances where the pr ovider's price exceeds the subsidy payment (98.45(b)(5))? No Yes. If yes: i. Provide the rationale for the Le ad Agency's policy to allow pro viders to charge families additional amounts above the required copayment, including a d emonstration of how the policy promotes affordability and access for families. . ii. Provide data (including data on the size and frequency of such amounts) on the extent to which CCDF providers charge additional amounts to families. iii. Describe the Lead Agency's analysis of the interaction between the additional amounts charged to families with the required family copayment and the ability of current subsidy payment rates to provide access to care without additio nal fees. 5 Establish Standards and Monitori ng Processes to Ensure the Heal th and Safety of Child Care Settings Lead Agencies are required to certify that there are in effect licensing requirements applicable to all child care ser vices in the state/territory, w hich supports the health and safety of all children in child care. States and territories ma y allow licensing exemptions. Lead Agencies must describe how such licensing exemptions do not end anger the health, safety, and development of CCDF children in licenseexempt care (98.16 (u)). Lead Agencies also must certify that there are in effect health and safety standards and training requirements applicable to providers serving CCDF chil dren whether they are licensed or license exempt. Thes e health and safety requiremen ts must be appropriate to the provider setting and age of the children served, must inclu de specific topics and training on those topics, and are subject to monitoring and enforcement procedures. The organization of this section begins with a description of t he licensing system for all child care providers in a state or territory and then moves to focus specifically on CCDF providers who may be licensed, or those exempt from licensing. The next s ection addresses childstaff ratios, group size limits, and required qualifications for care givers, teachers, and directors (98.16(m)) serving CCDF children. The section then covers the h ealth and safety requirements; standards, training, and monitoring and enforcement procedures to ensure that CCDF child care providers comply with licensing and health and safety requ irements (98.16(n)). Finally, Lead Agencies are asked to descr ibe any exemptions for relative providers (98.16(l)). In some cases, CCDF health and safety req uirements may be integrated wi thin the licensing system for licensed providers and may be s eparate for CCDF providers who a re licenseexempt. In either case, Lead Agencies are expected to identify and describe healt h and safety requirements for all providers receiving CCDF. Note: When responding to question s in this section, the OCC rec ognizes that each state/territory identifies and defines its own categories of ca re. The OCC does not expect states/territories to change the ir definitions to fit the CCDF defined categories of care. For these questions, provide response s that closely match the CCDF categories of care. Criminal background check requirements are included in this sec tion (98.16(o)). It is important to note that these requirements apply to all child ca re staff members who are licensed, regulated, or registered under state/territory law an d all other providers eligible to deliver CCDF services. Note: When asked for citations, responses can in clude state sta tute, regulations, administrative rules, policy manuals or policy issuances. See the Introductio n on page 4 for more detail. 5.1 Licensing Requirements Each state/territory must certify it has in effect licensing re quirements applicable to all child care services provided within th e state/territory (not restrict ed to providers receiving CCDF funds) and provide a detailed description of these requirements and how the requirements are effectively enforced (658E(c )(2)(F)). If any types of provi ders are exempt from licensing requirements, the state/territory must describe those exemption s and describe how these exemptions do not endanger the h ealth, safety, or development o f children. The descriptions must also include a ny exemptions based on provider category, type, or setting; length of day; and providers not subject to licensing because t he number of children served falls below a Lead Agencydefined threshold and any other exemp tion to licensing requirements (658E(c)(2)(F); 98.16(u); 98.40(a)(2)(iv)). 5.1.1 To certify, describe the licensing requirements applicable to c hild care services provided within the state/territory by identifying the providers in your state/territory that are subject to licensing using th e CCDF categories listed below.

The District allows one exceptio n for the maximum number of fiv e children if the in home caregiver provides after sc hool care for school age childr en (between the ages of five and 12). If an inhome careg iver exercises this exception, the caregiver must have an additional adult provider on site during the after school ho urs. 5.3 Health and Safety Standards and Training for CCDF Providers The state/territory must describe its requirements for preserv ice or orientation training and ongoing training. Lead Agencies are required to have minimum pr eservice or orientation training requirements (to be completed within 3 months), as app ropriate to the provider setting and the age of children served. This training must addr ess the required health and safety topics (658E(c)(2)(l)(i) a nd the content area of child d evelopment. Lead Agencies have flexibility in determining the number of training hours to requ ire, and they may consult with Caring for our Children Basics for best practices and the recom mended time needed to address these training requirements. Lead Agencies must also have ongoing training requirements for caregivers, teachers, and directors who are caring for c hildren receiving CCDF funds (658 E(c)(2)(I)(i); 98.44(b)(1)(iii)). Lead Agencies are to report the total number of ongoing trainin g hours that are required each year, but they do not have to report these hours out by topic (658E(c)(2)(G)( iii). Ongoing training requirements will be addressed in 5.3.13. Both preservice/orientation and ongoing trainings should be a p art of a broader systematic approach and progression of prof essional development (as descri bed in section 6) within a state/territory. States and territories must have health and safety standards for programs (e.g., child care centers, family child care homes , etc.) serving children receiv ing CCDF assistance relating to the required health and safety topics as appropriate to the pro vider setting and age of the children served (98.41(a)). This requirement is applicable to a ll child care programs receiving CCDF funds regardless of licensing status (i.e., licensed or li censeexempt). The only exception to this requirement is for relative providers, as def ined in 98.2. Lead Agencies have the option of exempting relative s from some or all CCDF health and safety requirements (98.42(c)). Exemptions for relative provider s' standards and training requi rements will be addressed in question 5.6.3. To certify, describe the following health and safety requiremen ts for programs serving children receiving CCDF assistan ce on the following topics (98. 16(l)) identified in questions 5.3.1 - 5.3.12. Note: Monitoring and enforcement will be addre ssed in subsection 5.4. 5.3.1 Prevention and control of infectious diseases (including immuni zations) health and safety standards and training requirements. a. Standard(s) i. Provide a brief description of t he standard(s). This descriptio n should identify the practices which must be implemented by child care programs. To ensure the prevention and cont rol of infectious diseases, in cluding immunizations, The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) has set forth the foll owing various requirements in the District's licensing regulations. Overall, a licensed provider sha ll conform, to the extent pract icable, to the National Health and Safety Performance Standards to ensure the safety and welfare of child ren and the cleanliness and sanitary conditions of the Facility , per 5A DCMR \u00a7 142.2. Section 151 of the licensing reg ulations sets forth the require ments for excluding both children and staff from the facility due to illness. A child who exhibits 1 or mor e symptoms of an illne ss must be isolated and parents contacted. After bei ng treated for the symptom(s) b y a licensed health care practitioner, the child may be readmitted to t he Facility only with written p ermission, and written instructions for continuing care if needed, from a licensed health care practiti oner. Section 152 of the licensing reg ulations sets forth the require ments for required health examinations and immunizations. All facilitie s must have complete documentat ion of a comprehensive physical health examination, which shall include evidence of age appropriate he alth examinations or screenings and up todate immunizations, and, for each child three years of age o r older, evidence of an oral health examination. Additionally, facilities are requi red to obtain the Certificate of Immunization Compliance, issued by the District of Columbia Department of Health, which certifies that the facility has reached the District's immunization compliance target of 98 percent for enrolled child ren and staff. Secti on 130 provides the recordkeeping requirements for a child enrolled at the facility . These records are necessary to protect the health and safety of childre n in care as operational contro l requires that information regarding each child in care be kept and made available on a needto know basi s. Section 131 requires a facility to maintain results of staff member 's preemployment physical exam inations, annual physical examinations, and immu nizations as they ar e necessary to ensure children's health and safety. Licensing regulations also seek to prevent and control infectio us diseases by setting forth requirements for: handwashing, specifically und er what circumstances hand wa shing and hand sanitizing are required for staff, volunteers, and childre n and specific hand washing a nd hand sanitizing procedures, see 5A DCMR \u00a7 143; diapering, specifically requiring maintaining a dia per changing area within arm's reach of a properly maintained a source of running water and soap that is not in the kitchen or eating area and procedures for soiled diapers, s ee 5A DCMR \u00a7 145; water play, specifically prohibiting the use of bottles, cups and glasses during water table play because the p resence of these items encourages children to drink from them and c ontamination of hands, toys, a nd equipment in the room in which play tables are located may play a role in the transmission of disea ses, see 5A DCMR \u00a7 157; the removal or covering of shoes prior to entering an infant play area to prot ect infants from hazardous toxins, see 5A DCMR \u00a7 124. Finally, section 139 requires tha t all staff members who provid e direct care for children must complete critical health and safety training in the prevention and contr ol of infectious diseases, including immunization, as appropriate to the provider setting and the ag e of children served, prior to caring for children unsupervised; and participate in annual professional d evelopment, including annual training that maintains and updates the health and safety standards. ii. Describe any variations in the s tandard(s) by category of care (i.e. Center, FCC, In home), licensing status (i.e. lic ensed, licenseexempt), and th e age of the children in care. Variations by category of care: In addition to all the requirem ents described above, a child development home must maintain, and provide to The Offic e of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) upon request, documentation establishing that each person living at the home th at houses the Facility has, wi thin the preceding 12 months, been examined by a licensed health care professional an d certified by that professional to be free of communicable diseases. See 5A DCMR 167. Variations by licensing status: Pursuant to D.C. Code \u00a7\u00a7 4411 and 72033, in home care providers are exempt from licensure and therefore exempt from t he child development facility licensing re quirements in 5A DCM R 100 et seq. However , pursuant to \u00a74411, in home providers must provide proof that the inhome caregiver wa s free of tuberculosis and other communicable diseases, along with anyone else living in the home or children in care, and is physically capable of caring for children. Furt hermore, through the provider agreement, license exemp t inhome providers are requir ed to comply with fire standards, complete all require d CCDF health and safety trainin g, criminal background checks/suitability determination, and maintain first aid and CP R certifications. Annual unannounced/announced v isits to relative and inhome providers are conducted by OSSE DEL Education Service Monitors to ensure compliance with t he provider agreement. Pursuant to D.C. Code \u00a7 72033, r elative care providers are exe mpt from licensure and therefore exempt from the chil d development facility licensing requirements in 5A DCMR 100 et seq. However, through the provider agreement, licen se exempt relative providers are still required to c omply with annual health certi fications, along with anyone else living in the home or children in care, criminal ba ckground checks/suitability determination, and maintain first aid and CPR certifications. R elative providers are exempt from all required CCDF health and safety trainings but O SSE is able to share resources with parents about hea lth and safety trainings should the parent wish for the relative to obtain training rega rdless of the exemption. Specif ically regarding this requirement, relative providers must comply with annual health certifications. Additionally, children cared for by relatives are exempted from immunizations if there are no other unrelated children who are cared for in the same s etting. iii. The Lead Agency must certify tha t the identified health and saf ety standard(s) is(are) in effect and enforced through mo nitoring. Provide the citation (s) for the standard(s), including citations for both licensed and license exempt providers.

Lead Agencies have the option to develop alternate monitoring r equirements for care provided in the child's home that are appropriate to the settin g. A child's home may not meet the same standards as other child care facilities and this provision gives Lead Agencies flexibility in conducting more streamlined and targeted onsite inspections. For example, Lead Agencies may choose to monitor inhome providers on basic health and safety requirements such as training and background checks. Lead Agenc ies could choose to focus on health and safety risks that pose imminent danger to childre n in care. This flexibility cannot be used to bypass the mo nitoring requirement altogether. States should develop procedures for notifying parents of monitoring protocols and co nsider whether it would be appropriate to obtain parental permission prior to entering the home for inspection (98.42(b)(2)(iv)(B)). a. To certify, describe the policies and practices for the annual monitoring of licenseexempt in home care, including if monitoring is announced or unannoun ced, occurs more frequently than once per year, and if differential monitoring procedures are used.

Lead Agencies are required to res erve and use a portion of thei r Child Care and Development Fund program expenditures for ac tivities designed to improve th e quality of child care services and to increase parent al options for and access to hig hquality child care (98.53). This section addresses the quality improvement activities imple mented by the Lead Agency related to the support of the ch ild care workforce and the deve lopment and implementation of early learning and developmental guidelines. It asks Lead Ag encies to describe the measurable indicators of progress used to evaluate state/territ ory progress in improving the quality of child care services. (98.53 (f)) in either of these two areas. States and territories are required to describe their framework for training, professional development, and postsecondary e ducation for caregivers, teach ers, and directors, including those working in sch oolage care (98.44(a)). This fra mework is part of a broader systematic approach building on h ealth and safety training (as described in section 5) within a state/territory. States and te rritories must incorporate thei r knowledge and application of health and safety standards, early learning guidelines, respons es to challenging behavior, and the engagement of families. States and territories are requ ired to establish a progression of professional devel opment opportunities to improv e the knowledge and skills of CCDF providers (658E(c)(2)(G)) . To the extent practicable, p rofessional development should be appropriate to work wi th a population of children of different ages, English language learners, children with disabilities, and Native Ameri cans (98.44(b)(2)(iv)). Training and professional development is one of the options that states and territories have for investing their CCDF qua lity funds (658G(b)(1)). 6.1 Professional Development Framework 6.1.1 Each state or territory must desc ribe their professional develo pment framework for training, professional development, and postsecondary education for care givers, teachers and directors in programs that serve children of all ages. This fra mework should be developed in consultation with the State Advi sory Council on Early Childhood Education and Care or similar coordinating body. The framework should include these component s: (1) professional standards and co mpetencies, (2) career pathway s, (3) advisory structures, (4) articulation, (5) workforce information, and (6) financing (98.44(a)(3)). Flexibility is provided on the strategies, brea dth, and depth with which state s and territories will develop and implement their framework. a. Describe how the state/territory 's framework for training and p rofessional development addresses the following required elements: i. State/territory professional standards and competencies. Descri be: The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) fac ilitates professional development opportunities within its Core Knowledge Areas (CKA). The CKA ar e wellintegrated professional standards that are aligned with the National Association for th e Education of Young Children (NAEYC) Standards for Early Chil dhood Professional Preparation, the Child Development Associate (CDA) Competency Standa rds, DC Common Core Early Lear ning Standards, District of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS) E ffective Schools Framework and the Federal Head Start Program Performance Standards. The CKA include: 1.) Child Growt h and Development; 2.) Observing, Documenting and Assessing to Support Young Children and Families; 3.) Health, Safety, and Nutrition; 4.) Curriculum; 5.) Inclusive Practices; 6.) Learning Environments; 7.) Building Family and Community Relationship; 8.) Diversity: Fami ly, Language, Culture, and Society; 9.) Program Management, Operation and Evaluation; 10.) Professionalism and Advocacy; and 11.) SocialEmotion al Development and Mental Heal th. In addition to the CKA, OSSE ensures that all Early Childhood Education (ECE) workforce members have an understanding of basic standards of child health, safety and de velopment with its mandatory training for all newly hired child care staff, which is aligned with the requireme nts of CCDF (See section 5). Further, OSSE ensures that all child care staff hav e continuous professional development annually that includes maintenance of health and sa fety trainings, as well as additional topic areas such as developmentally appropriate meth ods of positive behavior intervention and support and inclusion of children with special needs. ii. Career pathways. Describe: The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) wor ked with a regional advisory group that consists of represent atives from the DCMarylandVir ginia area to develop a competencybased career pathway f or the Early Childhood Educati on (ECE) workforce that was published in the fall of 2019. OSSE ensures that all ECE pr ofessionals are aware of the general responsibilities, minimum education requirements, and p rofessional development opportunities available for each designated position through mu ltiple public education efforts. OSSE offers a resource webpage for ECE professionals t o learn about position responsibilities, education requi rements and available programs and resources for furthering one's education and career. Additionally, OSSE has a live ECE H elp Desk that the workforce can call or email for informatio n, technical assistance and con nections to resources. The Professional Development Informa tion System (PDIS), OSSE's Work force Registry, allows early childhood educators to learn about career opportunities ( e.g., trainings), build their electronic resume, build their o wn electronic portfolio of educ ational credentials and more. PDIS is intended to allow ECE pr ofessionals to use their stored documents to request to be assigned to a career level based o n their education credentials and professional trainings. Through this system, the workforce can apply for an OSSEcertif ied review of their credentials for a professional certificate indicating the posit ions for which they are qualified to be employed; this certificate is called the Credential Verif ication Certificat e and the levels are primarily based on the years of experience and credential o btained. iii. Advisory structure. Describe: iv. The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) wor ks with the Program Quality Committee of the State Early Childhood Development Coordinating Council (SECDCC) to receive advisement on programming relating to workforce develop ment that includes professional development offerings, outreach efforts and resour ce development. OSSE worked with a regional advisory group that consisted of represe ntatives from the DC MarylandVirginia area. The DC Head Start Association also advi ses OSSE on policy as relates to credential requirements and professional development support s that affect the Head Start workforce. OSSE solicit s public comment on any policy or regula tion changes. Additionally, OSSE is a member of the Early ChildhoodHigher Education Collab orative, which aims to develop programming opportunities for the ECE workforce in coor dination with local postsecondary representatives. OS SE conducts surveys through it s workforce programs and its live ECE Help Desk to determine the needs of the local work force and identify hurdles preventing early childhood educa tors and prospective early chil dhood educators from accessing the existing resources. OSSE regularly collaborates w ith administrators of the Child Development Associate (CDA) prog rams within the District and co nvenes the CDA Administrators Committee as an o pportunity for different CDA pr ograms in the District to collaborate on topics s uch as CDA candidate needs of the progra m for the current and a future workforce pipeline. v. Articulation. Describe: The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) is a member of the Early ChildhoodHigher Education Collabo rative , as are the local uni versities that offer early childhoodrelated degree programs . The colleges have confirmed the articulation of the CDA credential into up to six colle ge credits. OSSE's grantees offe ring the CDA program and the District's T.E.A.C.H. program funded by OSSE work with college representatives on behalf of Early Childhood Education (ECE) p rofessionals to aid in the art iculation of college credits for the CDA and professional developme nt with associated continuing education units (CEUs). Some university partners are w illing to accept both CDA and CEU s for college credit, but this differs based on university. OSSE continues to work with the Co uncil for Professional Recognition (issuer of the CDA) to help facilitate the articula tion of CEUs and the CDA at local universities. vi. Workforce information. Describe: The Office of the State Superint endent of Education (OSSE) coll ects workforce data from several sources and tools to gai n a robust understanding of the District's Early Childhood Education (ECE) workforce to a id in programmatic planning. The data collection tools include the Professional Development Inf ormation System (PDIS), Divisio n of Early Learning Licensing Tool (DELLT), the ECE Help Des k, and Quorum (online learning pl atform). The various workforce data collected include current position, education cr edentials and years of experience. OSSE is in the process of modernizing our data syst ems, which will result in an integrated data system that hous es child, family, facility, pro vider and workforce data. OSSE is currently in the process of i nvestigating how this system ca n be maximized to strengthen workforce data. Additionally, OSSE requires its grantees offer ing Child Development Associate (CDA) programs and the District's T.E.A.C.H. program funded by OSSE, to collect data on the ECE professionals pa rticipating in the programs suc h as: city ward of employment, salary and career pathway goal. vii. Financing. Describe: The Office of the State Superint endent of Education (OSSE) uses both federal and local funds to provide professional development and continuing education op portunities to the ECE workforce. The funds are allocate d to a variety of workforce de velopment programs including inperson training courses, unlimited access to an on line learning platform and college tuition scholarships. b. The following are optional elemen ts, or elements that should be implemented to the extent practicable, in the training and professional development frame work. i. Continuing education unit trainings and creditbearing prof essional development to the extent practi cable. Describe: The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) iss ues certificates for earned Professional Development Learnin g Units (PLU) fo r educators att ending the professional development training opportunities through the Professional Dev elopment Information System (PDIS). These training o pportunities are provided by app roved trainers, based on the core knowledge areas and are adm inistered through DC Child Care Connections, as well as sister agencies and partners on a variety of topics that are re viewed and approved by OSSE. These trainings are offered in person and through virtual learn ing platforms, such as GoToMeeting and Webex. OSSE also offers a variety of opportunit ies to earn PLUs and Continuing Education Units (CEUs) through programs such as Quor um. Quorum is an online learning platform that provides m ore than 160 hours of courses and the ability to complete the required CDA coursework onlin e. There are course options in both English and Spanish at this time. The CDA and CEUs may articulate into college cred its at local institutions of higher educations, depending on the institution and program. ii. Engagement of training and professional development provid ers, including higher education, in aligning training and educational opportunities with the state/territory's framework. Describe: The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) has a robust, researchbased Trainer Approval Program (TAP) t hat ensures the child care work force has access to a wide variety of quality training oppo rtunities that improve their kn owledge, skills, and competency in early childhood dev elopment from infancy through preK to kindergarten. TAP certifies both individual and organizational professional d evelopment trainers that provide ongoing training and pr ofessional development opportuni ties in the 11 Core Knowledge Areas (CKAs) that detail the specific knowledge and s kills needed by early childhood professionals to work effectively with all young chil dren and families. A variety of professional development (PD) o pportunities are afforded throug h OSSE grantees, a contract with Quorum, and partne rships with other government ag encies (e.g., DC Health, Department of Behavioral Health, etc.). Additionally, the Stron g Start program within OSSE, DC's early intervention program, is approved to provide trainin g opportunities to the workforce, and does so on a regul ar basis. Their trainings focu s on healthy development, supports for young children and fa milies and screening tools, s uch as the Ages and Stages Questionaire. iii. Other. Describe: 6.1.2 Describe how the state/territory developed its professional dev elopment framework in consultation with the State Advi sory Council on Early Childhood Education and Care (if applicable) or similar coordinating body if there is no SAC tha t addresses the professional development, training, and education of child care providers and staff. The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) lea dership has participated in the Regional Implementation Network with statebased leadership, in cluding neighboring states Virginia and Maryland. Once this network convenes again, OSSE l eadership will continue to participate. OSSE was a part of the development of the career p athway and framework that was led by the Washington Region Early Care and Education Workforce Network (the Network). Beginning in 2016, the Network hel ped with developing and launc hing a career pathway for the early care and education workfor ce of the DC region. This caree r pathway is based on educator competencies and tied to compensation and quality. Additionally , OSSE continues to work with the Program Quality Committee of the State Early Childhood Deve lopment Coordinating Council (SECDCC) to receive advisement o n programming relating to workf orce development that includes professional developme nt offerings, support to degree programs, resource development and other topics as the committee deems needed at a ny given time. 6.1.3 Describe how the framework impro ves the quality, diversity, sta bility, and retention of caregivers, teachers, and directors (98.44(a)(7)). The Office of the State Superint endent of Education (OSSE) see ks to promote diversity, stability, retention, and progression of the early c hildhood workforce through numerous scholarship and grant opportunities that enabl e child care professionals access to programs at little or no cost to them, including those that are funded by OSSE and by other District government entities, s uch as the associate's degree program in early childhood offered through t he University of the District of Columbia Community C ollege. The ECE Help Desk and O SSE grantees also support the child care workforce to access grants and scholarsh ips from federal and other sources. OSSE strives to recruit and retain diverse educa tors by providing professional development (PD) a nd continuing education opportun ities to diverse individuals. For example, OSSE administers a Child Development Associate (CDA) Training and Scholarship program via two grantees that offer th eir program in English, Spanish and Amharic lang uages based on the needs of th e current workforce and those looking to e nter the workforce. The OSSEsp onsored elearning platform for the Early Childhood Education (ECE) workforce is o ffers all courses in English and Spanish, including all coursework needed to obtain a CDA. In alignment with the DC Language Access Act, O SSE strives to reach individu als across the District by making publications available in the six most commo n languages spoken. 6.2 Training and Professional Development Requirements The Lead Agency must describe ho w its established health and sa fety requirements for pre service or orientation training and ongoing professional develo pment requirements\u2014as described in Section 5 for caregivers, teachers, and directors in CCDF programs\u2014align, to the extent practicable, with the sta te/territory professional devel opment framework. These requirements must be designed to enable child care providers to promote the social, emotional, physical, and cogniti ve development of children and to improve the knowledge and skills of the child care work force. Such requirements shall be applicable to child care providers caring for children re ceiving CCDF funds across the e ntire age span, from birth through age 12 (658E(c )(2)(G)). Ongoing training and profession al development should be accessible and appropriate to the setting and age of the childr en served (98.44(b)(2)). 6.2.1 Describe how the state/territory incorporates into training and professional development opportunities: the knowledge and application of its early learning and develop mental guidelines (where applicable); its health and safety standards (as described in section 5); and socialemotional/behavioral a nd mental health of young chil dren intervention models, which can include positive behavior intervention and su pport models that reduce the likelihood of suspension and expulsion of children ( as described in Section 2 of the Pre Print) (98.44(b)). The District's training and prof essional development requiremen ts are enumerated in the Child Development Facility Licensing Regulations. Training requ irements include preservice, orientation and annual health and safety training; courses in t he DC Early Learning Standards, the District's early learning and developmental guidelines, and courses in developmentally appropriate methods of positive behavior intervention and suppo rt. As a result of the updated DC Early Learning Standards, a training and professiona l development rollout plan was developed. Training of train ers has been hel d for both comm unitybased organizations and local education agencies on the updated standards. Addition ally, the required health and safety trainings are provided th rough both online (Quorum elea rning platform) and in person. Health and safety training requirements can be tracked for each individual employee through a tracker embedded in t he dashboard of the Professional Development Information System (PDIS). OSSE has intent ionally increased the availabilit y of training and supports related to socialemotional/beh avioral development and mental h ealth intervention models in response to the need. The Office of the State Superint endent of Education (OSSE) also works through partnerships internally (i.e., Strong Start), and with other DC agencies (e. g., the Department of Behavioral Health, DC Health, Early Stages) to provide trainings to provid ers. Community of practice meetings are held monthly for pr oviders participating in Capita l Quality, DC's redesigned Quality Rating and Improvement System (QRIS). In addition to th e previously mentioned courses, OSSE also provides a ccess to an online learning platfo rm to providers that allows them to take courses t oward the CDA credential, some of the lic ensing requirements, as well as course offerings on resiliency, trauma and behavior manageme nt. 6.2.2 Describe how the state/territory's training and professional de velopment are accessible to providers supported through Indian tribes or tribal organiza tions receiving CCDF funds (as applicable) (98.44(b)(2)(vi)). N/A 6.2.3 States/territories are required to facilitate participation of child care providers with limited English proficiency and disabilities in the subsidy sys tem (98.16 (dd)). Describe how the state/territory will recruit and facilitate the partici pation of providers in the subsidy system: a. with limited English proficiency. Currently, the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) offers more than 160 courses available in Spanish through an online learning platfor m, Quorum. Inperson trainings are often available in Spanish or with interpretation services. Additional training has been developed in Amharic and OSSE hopes to expand availabl e opportunities in the Amharic language based on demand. OSSE engages regularly with t he District's Multi cultural SpanishSpeaking Provid ers Association and ensures tha t course descriptions for all courses offered in Spanish are t ranslated and sent directly to the association. CDA training and scholarship programs are als o available in both Amharic and Spanish. OSSE's recruitment and communication s trategy also seeks to engage pro viders with limited English proficiency to participate in Capital Quality. Capital Quality aims to entice providers to participate in the subsidy progra m due to the increased rates, training, technical assistance, oneonone coaching and a publicf acing profile that providers have access to. Capital Quality engages the community t hrough the My Child Care DC webs ite, the OSSE website and through DC Child Care Connect ions, the Distri ct's child car e resource and referral (CCR&R) agency. Capital Quality employs staff who speak Spanis h and Amharic, all other staff have access to the language access line for any individua l that may have questions or want to learn more about the initiative. b. who have disabilities. The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) pro vides outreach and services to eligible persons with disabilities. Customer service sites a re accessible and comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act requirements (e.g., the OSS E office building, child care resource and referral, or CCR&R, service centers). The online l earning platform also supports individuals with limited mobility. Multiple modes of c ommunication are available to support individual needs. Par t of the recruitment and commun ication strategy is related to involvement in Capital Qualit y, the District's Quality Ratin g and Improvement System. Capital Quality aims to entice p roviders to participate in the subsidy program due to the increased rates, training, techni cal assistance, oneonone coa ching and a publicfacing profile that providers have acce ss to Capital Quality engages t he community through the My Child Care DC website, the OSSE website and through DC Child Ca re Connections, the District's CCR&R agency. 6.2.4 Describe how the state/territory's training and professional de velopment requirements are appropriate, to the extent pract icable, for child care provider s who care for children receiving child care subsidies, including children of different age groups (such as specialized credentials for providers who ca re for infants and/or schoolag e children); Englishlanguage learners; children with developmental delays and disabilities; and Native Americans, including Indians as defined in Section 4 of the Indian SelfDe termination an d Education Assistance Act (including Alaska Natives) and Native Hawaiians (98.44(b)(2)(iv)). The District's training and prof essional development requiremen ts enumerated in the Child Development Facilities Licensing Regulations specify the follow ing topic areas supportive of child care providers who care for children receiving child care subsidies, English learners and children with developmental delays and disabilities: community health and social services resources for children and families; developmentally appropriat e methods of positive behavior intervention and suppo rt; developmentally appropriate programming for infants, toddlers, preschool and/or schoolage children, as applicable; enhancing selfregulation and selfesteem in children; and inclu sion of children with special needs, including the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Individuals with Disabi lities Education Act. 6.2.5 The Lead Agency must provide training and technical assistance (TA) to providers and appropriate Lead Agency (or designated entity) staff on identif ying and serving children and families experiencing ho melessness (658E(c)(3)(B)(i)). a. Describe the state/territory's training and TA efforts for prov iders in identifying and serving children and their families experiencing homelessness ( relates to question 3.2.2). The Office of the State Superint endent of Education (OSSE) prov ides professional development with a sequential learning approach that addresses the complexity of homelessness. OSSE offers various training opportunities for pr oviders, local education agencies and community partners focusing on this special popula tion, including topics relevant to homeless children a nd their families such as the Mc KinneyVento Homeless Assistance Act and the Elementary and Secondary Education Act a s reauthorized by the Every Student Succeeds Act of 2015; Routines that Support Emoti onal WellBeing and Stability in the Classroom; Recogn izing Signs of Stress in Youn g Children; Ecomapping: A Tool for Assessing Support System s; and Engaging and Supporting Families Experiencing Homelessness. OSSE facilitates co llaboration and partnership wi th the District's community based organizations that serve h omeless families to improve dev elopmental outcomes for atrisk children. Families of chi ldren under age three who are not eligible for Part C services may be provided opportunities to engage with organizations that provide evidencebased parent workshops, ongoing develo pmental monitoring and communit ybased information sessions conducted by early intervention professionals. Please note that these opportunities are available to all families (an d not exclusively for families experiencing homelessness). The Virginia Williams Family Resour ce Center (VWFRC) serves as an intake hub for screening and placement for families seeking emergency shelter and other essential resources. OSSE has established a partnership wi th VWFRC to provide OSSE staff onsite to assist parents who have children in need of child care or educational supports, su ch as immediate enrollment and transportation assistance. OS SE developed a Homeless Educat ion Program Fact Sheet for Parents which provides guidance on the educational rights o f children, youth and families experiencing homelessne ss. Additionally, OSSE's Homele ss Education Program staff will continue to provide training for child development directo rs and enrollment coordinators on how to identify and support families that are e xperiencing homelessness. b. Describe the state/territory's training and TA efforts for Lead Agency (or designated entity) staff in identifying and serving children and their fam ilies experiencing homelessness (connects to question 3.3.6). The Office of the State Superint endent of Education (OSSE) and the Department of Human Services continue their partnership to ensure that the District 's central intake center for families who are experiencing ho melessness has an onsite child care intake specialist. Training has been provided to all child care intake staff and c ommunity staff in Level Two child development sites on the eligibility criteria. Families e xperiencing homelessness are categorically eligible for child c are subsidy and Head Start an d Early Head Start. 6.2.6 Lead Agencies must develop and implement strategies to strength en the business practices of child care providers to expand the supply and to improve the qu ality of child care services (98.16 (z)). Describe the state/ territory's strategies to stren gthen providers' business practices, which can include training and/or TA efforts. a. Describe the strategies that the state/territory is developing and implementing for strengthening child care providers' business practices. The District of Columbia revised the Child Development Faciliti es Licensing Regulations to specifically address additional annual professional development that may include basic and advanced business training for child care providers. Additional ly, the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE ) reviewed, compiled and analy zed local and national resources on best practices for child care business owners and directors; reviewed, compiled and analyzed data on p rofessional development offering s and attendance to plan and prepare for additional professional development opportuniti es. OSSE also engaged the State Early Childhood Developme nt Coordinating Council (SECDCC) Program Quality Committee in identifying online and inperson learning opportun ities. The Shared Services Business Alliance (SSBA), establis hed in fiscal year 2017 (FY17 ), currently serves nearly half of all licensed child development homes. SSBA is initiated a pi lot for small child development centers (e.g., centers with four or fewer classroom s). With increased need and increased funding available, OSSE will expand access to the SSB A to all Level I providers in the district in FY21. Child dev elopment facilities will also ha ve access to grants, resources and technical assistance through the Low Income Investment Fund (LIIF) and the Washington Area Community Investm ent Fund through both local an d federal funding streams. The District's Child Ca re Resource and Referral agency (CCR&R) identified and certified trainers that offer bus iness practices for child care center directors and owners and implemented business practices training and added the training to the Professional Development Information System ( PDIS). Business practice resour ces (e.g., policy templates) are available to all licensed chi ld development facilities on t he Early Childhood Share DC (EC Share DC) website. PreK Enhancem ent and Expansion Program (PKE EP) grantees received technical assistance training in a number of fiscal topics, inc luding cost reimbursement processes, budgeting, provision of relevant and appropriate sup porting documentation to substantiate costs a nd indirect costs. b.

The Office of the State Superint endent of Education (OSSE) aims to have at least 50 percent of child development pro grams with designations of qual ity or highquality during the performance period. Currently , 41.2 percent of child develo pment facilities participating in the subsidized child care program have a desig nation of quality or high quality. 6.4 Early Learning and Developmental Guidelines 6.4.1 States and territories are require d to develop, maintain, or im plement early learning and developmental guidelines that are appropriate for children in a forward progression from birth to kindergarten entry (i.e., birth to three, three to five, bir th to five), describing what children should know and be able to do a nd covering the essential domain s of early childhood development. These early learning and developmental guidelines are to be used statewide and territorywide by child care providers and in the development a nd implementation of training and professional development ( 658E(c)(2)(T)). The required esse ntial domains for these guidelines are cognition, including language arts and mathemati cs; social, emotional, and physical development; and approaches toward learning (98.15(a)( 9)). At the option of the state/territory, early learning and developmental guidelines fo r outofschool time may be developed. Note: States and territories may use the quality set aside, discussed in section 7, to improve on the development or implementation of early learni ng and developmental guidelines. a. Describe how the state/territory's early learning and developme ntal guidelines address the following requirements: i. Are researchbased. The Office of the State Superint endent of Education (OSSE) publ ished the updated District of Columbia Early Lea rning Standards (DC ELS) in 2019. The updated edition of the DC ELS is a response to the e volution of the standards move ment in early care and education throughout the country. The DC ELS include alignment with the Common Core State Standards for English La nguage Arts and Mathematics (2010 ) as well as the Next Generation Science Standards ( 2013). The standards are also ali gned with the Head Start Early Learning Outcomes Framewor k: Ages Birth to Five (2015), t hus ensuring that all children receive the same standardsbased instruction and appro priate learning experiences regardless of program auspices. ii. Developmentally appropriate. DC Early Learning Standards (DC EL S) are researchbased and int entionally broken down by age levels appropriate for th e growth and development contin uum. Those age levels include infants, toddlers, 2yea rolds, preschoolers, preK exi t expectations and kindergarten exit expectations to ensure developmentally approp riate practice (DAP) and standards by subject. iii. Culturally and linguistically appropriate. The DC Early Learning Standards (DC ELS) is designed to out line developmental trajectories for children from a variety of backgrounds with differing abil ities. The DC ELS is published in seven languages i ncluding English, Spanish, Amh aric, Korean, Mandarin Chinese, Vietnamese and French. Indicators, examples and suppor tive practices are culturally sensitive and inclusive of children and families div erse backgrounds. iv. Aligned with kindergarten entry. The DC Early Learning Standards (DC ELS) include indicators for infants, toddlers, 2year olds and preschoolers, as well as exit expectations for childre n leaving preK and kindergarten. The kindergarten exit expectations mirror the Com mon Core State Standards for English Language Ar ts and Mathematics and the Nex t Generation Science Standards (NGSS) v. Appropriate for all children from birth to kindergarten entry. The DC Early Learning Standards (DC ELS) include indicators for infants, toddlers, 2year olds and preschoolers, as well as exit expectations for childre n leaving preK and kindergarten. These standards pro vide parents and teachers with information about expectations for what children k now and are able to do and desc ribe how children progress at various ages and deve lopment levels. They focus on the whole child and include a broad range of domains because young children's learn ing and development are interrelated and cross all areas of learning. vi. Implemented in consultation with the educational agency and the State Advisory Council or similar coordinating body. The Office of the State Superint endent of Education (OSSE) cons ulted and worked with the State Early Childhood D evelopment Coordinating Council (SECDCC), local educational agencies (LEAs), com munitybased organizations (CBO s) and other stakeholders to create an implem entation plan that laid out act ivities for the state, partners and LEAs to accomplish and the timeline for doing so. b. Describe how the required domains are included in the state/ter ritory's early learning and developmental guidelines. Respon ses for \"other\" are optional. i. Cognition, including language arts and mathematics. Fourteen standards cove r these domains, inc luding the following : Demonstrates understand ing of spoken language; Uses language to express self; Uses conventional grammar and syntax; Uses conventional conversational and other social communication skills; Demonstrates understanding of print concepts; Demonstrates comprehension of printed materials read aloud; Hears and discriminates the so unds of English and/or home langu ages; Writes letters and words; Understands the purpose of writing and drawing; Matches, groups and classifies objects; Demonstrates knowledge of numbers and counting; Demonstrates knowledge of volu me, height, weight and length; Identifies and labels shapes; and Demonstrates understanding of positional words. ii. Social and Emotional development. The social and emotional domain includes six standards for chil dren's learning and development: Expresses a variety of feelings and learns to manage them; Recognizes the feelings and righ ts of others and responds appro priately; Manages own behavior; Develops positive rela tionships with adults; Engages and plays with peers; and Resolves conflicts with others. iii. Physical development. This domain includes two standards for children's learning and development: Demonstrates strength and coordination of large muscles; and Demonstrates strength and coor dination of small muscles. This domain also includes health and safety standards that cove r the following: Demonstrates behaviors that pro mote health and safety; and Demonstrates competent eating behaviors through the maintenance of positive eating attitudes, opt imal food acceptance skills, self regulation of food intake, mindful food choices and positive body image. iv. Approaches toward learning. This domain includes four standards for children's learning and development: Attends and engages with curiosity; Shows persistence; Approaches tasks flexibly; and Uses symbols and takes on pretend roles. v. Describe how other optional domains are included, if any: The DC Early Learning Standards ( DC ELS) also has a set of stan dards under Science and Engineering and the Arts, which include: Investigates living things; Investigates physical objects; Investigates characteris tics of Earth and space; Investigates engineering; Engages in music and movement activities; Engages in drama activities; and Explores the visual arts. c. Describe how the state/territory's early learning and developme ntal guidelines are updated and include the date first issued and/or the frequency of updat es. The DC Common Core Early Learni ng Standards (DC CCELS) were ori ginally adopted in 2012. In May 2017, the Office of the St ate Superintende nt of Educatio n (OSSE) launched a process to review the DC CCELS wit h a goal of considering addit ions in key areas to better align with the Head Start Early Learning Framework, Next Genera tion Science Standards, arts integration and to address th e needs of dual language lear ners. OSSE collaborated and worked with several stakeholders , including individuals from lo cal education agencies, national agencies, federal agencies, child care providers and e xperts working with the WestEd Mid Atlantic Comprehensive Center in reviewing and updat ing the DC CCELS. A draft of the enhanced standards w as shared with different stake holders within the District before finalizing the document. In October 2019, the updated DC ELS and implementation plan were completed. The Divisio n of Early Learning will contin ue to follow activities set in the implementation plan and will continually look for ways to k eep the standards upto date. d. If applicable, discuss the state process for the adoption, impl ementation, and continued improvement of state outofschool time standards. N/A e. Provide the Web link to the stat e/territory's early learning an d developmental guidelines and if available, the schoolage guidelines. The District of Columbia Early L earning Standards (DC ELS) can be accessed here on the Office of the State Superintende nt of Education (OSSE) website. 6.4.2 CCDF funds cannot be used to develop or implement an assessment for children that: Will be the primary or sole basis to determine a child care pro vider ineligible to participate in the CCDF Will be used as the primary or sole basis to provide a reward o r sanction for an individual provider Will be used as the primary or sole method for assessing progra m effectiveness Will be used to deny children eligibility to participate in the CCDF (658E(c)(2)(T)(ii)(I ); 98.15(a)(2)) Describe how the state/territory's early learning and developme ntal guidelines are used. The primary purpose of the DC Ea rly Learning Standards (DC ELS) is to ensure that children in the District of Columbia have the kinds of rich and robust earl y learning experiences that prepare them for success in school and for lifelong learning. T he DC ELS includes indicators for infants, toddlers, 2yearolds and preschoolers, as well as exi t expectations for children leaving preK and kindergarten. The kind ergarten exit expectations mirr or the Common Core State Standards for English Language Ar ts and Mathematics and the Nex t Generation Science Standards (NGSS). To achieve this goal, the Early Learning Standards should be us ed as: A resource for guiding the selection and implementation of curr iculum; A focus for discussion by familie s, educators, community member s and policymakers regarding the care and education of young children; A guide for selecting assessments appropriate for children from a variety of backgrounds with differing abilities; A guide for planning experiences and instruction that enable ch ildren to make progress in meeting the standards; and A framework for planning profe ssional development opportunities for education staff. 6.4.3 If quality funds are used to develop, maintain, or implement ea rly learning and development guidelines, describe the measur able indicators that will be use d to evaluate the state/territory's progress in imp roving the quality of child ca re programs and services and the data on the extent to which the state/territory has met these m easures (98.53(f)(3)). Local funds are used to develop, maintain or implement the DC E arly Learning Standards (DC ELS). 7 Support Continuous Quality Improvement Lead Agencies are required to use a portion of their Child Care and Development Fund program expenditures for activities designed to improve the qua lity of child care services and to increase parental options f or and access to highquality chi ld care (98.53). The quality activities should be aligned with a statewide or territorywide assessment of the state's or territory's need to carry out such services and care. States and territories are requi red to report on these quality improvement investments through CCDF in three ways: 1. In the CCDF Plan, the ACF 118, s tates and territories will desc ribe the types of activities supported by quality investments over the 3year per iod (658G(b); 98.16(j)). 2. In the annual expenditure repo rt, the ACF696, ACF will collect data on how much CCDF funding is spent on quality activities. This report will b e used to determine compliance with the required quality and infant and toddler spe nding requirements (658G(d)(1); 98.53(f)). 3. For each year of the Plan peri od, states and territories will s ubmit a Quality Progress Report, the ACF 218, that will include a description o f activities funded by quality expenditures and the measures used by the state/territo ry to evaluate its progress in improving the quality of child care programs and se rvices within the state/territory (658G(d); 98.53(f)). States and territories must fund efforts in at least one of the following 10 activities: Supporting the training and professional development of the chi ld care workforce (Addressed in Section 6) Improving on the development or implementation of early learnin g and developmental guidelines (Addressed in Section 6) Developing, implementing, or enhancing a tiered quality rating and improvement system or other systems of quality improvement for child care p roviders and services Improving the supply and quality of child care programs and ser vices for infants and toddlers Establishing or expanding a statewide system of child care reso urce and referral services Supporting compliance with state/territory requirements for lic ensing, inspection, monitoring, training, and health and safety (as des cribed in section 5) Evaluating the quality of child c are programs in the state/terr itory, including evaluating how programs positively impact children Supporting providers in the vol untary pursuit of accreditation Supporting the development or adoption of highquality program standards related to health, mental health, nutrition, physical activity, and physical development Performing other activities to im prove the quality of child car e services, as long as outcome measures relating to improved provider preparedness, child safety, child well being, or kindergarten entry are possible Throughout this Plan, states and territories will describe the types of quality improvement activities where CCD F investments are being made, i ncluding but not limited to, quality setaside funds, and will describe the meas urable indicators of progress used to evaluate state/territory progress in improving the quality of child care services for each expenditure ( 98.53(f)). These activities can benefit infants and toddlers through schoolage populations , and all categories of care. It is important that while Lead Agencies have the flexibility to define \"high quality\" and develop strategies and standards to support their definition, Lead Agencies should consider how that definition and those strategies for different provider types reflect and acknowledge their unique differences and how quality varies in di fferent settings, including family child care and small care settings as well as child care centers. This section covers the quality activities needs assessment, qu ality improvement activities, and indicators of progress for each o f the activities undertaken in the state or territory. 7.1 Quality Activities Needs Assessment for Child Care Services 7.1.1 Lead Agencies must invest in quality activities based on an ass essment of the state/territory's needs to carry o ut those activities. Lead Age ncies have the flexibility to design an assessment of their quality activities that best meet their needs, including how often they do the assessment. Describe your state/territory a ssessment process, including the frequency of assessment (658G(a)(1); 98.53(a)). The Office of the State Superint endent of Education (OSSE) has implemented the District's Quality Rating and Improvement System (QRIS), Capital Quality, which also serves as a tiered reimbursement rate system. The QR IS, Capital Quality, provides a common measure of quality that informs consumers and helps target investments and plannin g in early childhood care and education. This common measure of quality means that there is a lignment of quality standards across child development homes, centers and publicly funded pre K that is focused on positive outcomes for children. The QRIS assesses quality based on the f ollowing assessments: Infant/Toddler Environment Rating Scale (ITERS), Family Child C are Environment Rating Scale (FCCERS) and Classroom Assessment Scoring System PreK (CLASS P reK). These assessments are conducted annually, and two year s of data are collected before child development facilities are rated under Capital Quality. The first ratings under Capital Qu ality occurred in fall 2019. Although OSSE expected to comple te the second ratings under Cap ital Quality in fall 2020, OSSE suspended ITERS, FCCERS and CLASS PreK data collection and can celed the rating process in spring and fall 2020 during the co ronavirus (COVID19) public h ealth emergency. OSSE reviewed baseline data from the first rati ngs under Capital Quality to i nform quality activities and supports that best meet the needs of child development homes an d centers in the District. This process will continue annually onc e data collection and the rat ing process are ab le to resume. In addition to the formal assessmen ts, OSSE's Capital Quality gran tee, which provides oneonone technical assistance and coaching to child development homes an d centers through early childhood coaching professional s, known as quality facilitators , collects early childhood care and education provider feedback on Community of Practice (CoP) meet ings and the support received from the quality facilitators on an ongoing basis. OSSE and the grantee use this information to inform the supports that child d evelopment homes and centers re ceive. 7.1.2 Describe the findings of the assessment and if any overarching goals for quality improvement were identified. If applicable, include a direct UR L/website link for any available evaluation or research related to the findings. The Office of the State Superint endent of Educat ion (OSSE), as the lead agency, is using these results to inform our stra tegies, investme nts and the sup port OSSE provides to the providers in terms of traini ng, professional development an d supplies/resources. OSSE has collected Classroom Asse ssment Scoring Sy stem (CLASS) PreK data since 2013 and Environmental Rating Scale ( ERS) data since 2017. In order to better assess quality in the District, OSSE has transitioned from thresholds, which w ere previously reported against, to a system of floors and targets. The Infant and Todd ler Environmental Rating Scale (ITERS) and the Family Ch ild Care Environmental Rating Sc ale (FCCERS) yield programlevel observation scores on a scale of one to seven; fo r both ITERS and FCCERS the floor is 3 and the target is 6. CLASS yields three program level domain scores on a scale of 1 to 7; for CLASS, floor s are 4.5 for the Emotional Su pport and Classroom Organization domains and two for the Instructional Support doma in. Targets are 5 for the Emotional Support and Classr oom Organization domains and 4 for the Instructional Support domain. Additionally, O SSE aims to have at least 50 per cent of child development programs with designations of quality or highquali ty during the performance period. Currently, 41. 2 percent of child developmen t facilities participating in the subsidized child care program have a desig nation of quality or high quality. 7.2 Use of Quality Funds 7.2.1 Check the quality improvement acti vities in which the state/ter ritory is investing.

QRIS refers to a systematic fr amework for evaluating, improving, and communicating the level of quality in early chil dhood programs and contains five key elements: 1. Program standards 2. Supports to programs to improve quality 3. Financial incentives and supports 4. Quality assurance and monitoring 5. Outreach and consumer education 7.3.1 Does your state/territory have a quality rating and improvement system or another system of quality improvement? a. No, the state/territory has no plans for QRIS development. If no, skip to 7.4.1. b. No, but the state/territory is in the QRIS development phas e. If no, skip to7.4.1. c. Describe Yes, the state/territory has a QRIS operating statewide or terr itorywide. Describe how the QRIS is administered (e.g., statewide or local ly or through CCR&R entities) and any partners, and provide a link, if availa ble. The District's QRIS, Capital Qua lity, is administered statewide . The Office of the State Superintendent of Educatio n (OSSE) serves as the lead age ncy and a grantee provides oneonone technical assistance and coaching t o child development homes and centers th rough early childhood coaching professionals, known as Quality Facilitators. Capital Quality i ncludes 10 quality indicators that early childhood care and education providers us e to complete a webbased selfassessment of their child development homes and centers. These 10 quality indicators include: 1) curriculum and instruct ion are aligned to DC Early Learning Standards (DC EL S); 2) Formal and informal as sessments are aligned to curriculum; 3) Formal and informal assessments are i mplemented; 4) Data are used to inform instructional and professional practice s (CLASS PreK and/or ITERS and/or FCCERS are used to inform instructional and professional practices); 5) Culturally and lin guistically responsive practic es are implemented; 6) Inclusion practices are implemented; 7) Developmental screen ings are implemented; 8) Early care and education professionals meaningf ully engage in professional development; 9) Fam ily engagement promotes positiv e and goal oriented relationships; and 10) Mission statements are reflecti ve of both the program and the families served . OSSE collects and analyzes the Continuous Quality Improvement Plan (CQIP) (selfassessment data annually to inform the resources and supports providers receive as participants in Cap ital Quality. OSSE also collects feedback on th e CoP meetings and on provider s' experience with their quality facilitators. In addition to the selfassess ment, OSSE collects and analyzes the CLASS PreK, ITERS and FCCERS data to evaluat e progress and determine areas where supports ar e needed. The following is a l ink to the Capital Quality website, which provides additional information: https://osse.dc.gov/page/capitalqualityqris . d. Yes, the state/territory has a QRIS initiative operating as a pilottest in a few localities or only a few levels but does not have a fully opera ting initiative on a statewide or territorywide basis. Provide a link, if available . e. Yes, the state/territory has another system of quality impr ovement. Describe the other system of quality improvem ent and provide a link, if avai lable. 7.3.2 Indicate how providers participate in the state or territory's QRIS or another system of quality improvement. a. Are providers required to participate in the QRIS or another sy stem of quality improvement? Check all that apply if response differs for diffe rent categories of care. i. Participation is voluntary. ii. Participation is partially ma ndatory. For example, particip ation is mandatory for providers serving children receiving a subsidy, participation i s mandatory for all licensed providers or participation is mandatory for programs s erving children birth to age 5 receiving a subsidy. If checked, describe the re lationship between QRIS participation and subsidy (e.g., minimum rating required, reimbursed at higher rates for achieving higher ratings, participation at any level). According to Section 102 of the District of Columbia Municipal Regulations (DCMR) Title 5, Chap ter 5A1, child development facilities that receive Child Care Development Fund (CCDF) funding m ust participate in the Distric t's Capital Quality, the District's Quality Rating and Improvement System ( QRIS), while licensed nonsubsidy providers ma y elect to participate. The Ca pital Quality designation determines the tiered reimbursement rate for subsid y providers. In Capital Quality, subsidy provider s are reimbursed based on four designations, or tiers (Developing, Progressing, Quality and HighQuality), with the highest level of quality receiving the highest tiered reimbursement rate. iii. Participation is required for all providers. b. Which types of settings or distin ctive approaches to early chil dhood education and care participate in the state/territory's QRIS or another system of quality improvement? Check all that apply. i. Licensed child care centers ii. Licensed family child care homes iii. Licenseexempt providers iv. Early Head Start programs v. Head Start programs vi. State prekindergarten or preschool programs vii. Local districtsupported prekindergarten programs viii. Programs serving infants and toddlers ix. Programs serving schoolage children x. Faithbased settings xi. Tribally operated programs xiv. Other. Describe: c. Describe how the Lead Agency's QRIS, or other system for improv ing quality, considers how quality may look different in the different types of provid er settings which participate in the QRIS or other system of quality improvement. For instance, does the system of quality improvement consider what quality looks l ike in a family child care home with mixedage groups vs. child care centers with sep arate age groups? Or are standards related to quality environments flexible enough t o define quality in homebased environments, as well as child care center environme nts? The District developed its Quality Rating and Improvement Syste m (QRIS), Capital Quality, to be reflective of and responsive to the different ty pes of provider settings participating in the QRIS. The o bservation measures used in lic ensed child care centers, the Infant/Toddler Envir onment Rating Scale (ITERS) an d Classroom Assessment Scoring System PreK (CLASS PreK), are specific to those settings and the observation measure used in licen sed family child care homes, t he Family Child Care Environment Rating Scale (FCCERS ), is specific to those setting s. All observation measures used are valid and reliable measures of early care and education program quality, and accurately measure quality across different progra m types such as Early Head Start, state prekindergarte n (i.e., the District's PreK Enhancement and Expansion Program), faithbase d settings and other programs. 7.3.3 Identify how the state or territory supports and assesses the q uality of child care providers. The Lead Agency may invest in the development, implementation, or enhancement of a tiered quality rating and improv ement system for child care pro viders and services or another system of quality improvement. Not e: If a Lead Agency decides t o invest CCDF quality dollars in a QRIS, that agency can use the funding to assist in meeting consumer education requirements (98.33). If the Lead Agency has a QRIS, respond to questions 7.3.3 through 7.3.6. Do the state/territory's quality improvement standards align wi th or have reciprocity with any of the following standards? No Yes. If yes, check the type of alignment, if any, between the s tate/territory's quality standards and other standa rds. Check all that apply. a. Programs that meet state/territory preK standards are able to meet all or part of the quality improvement standards (e.g., content of the standar ds is the same, there is a reciprocal agreement between preK programs and the Quality Rating and improvement System). b. Programs that meet federal He ad Start Program Performance St andards are able to meet all or part of the quality improvement standards (e.g., content of the standards is the same, there is a reciprocal agreement between Head Start programs and the Quality Rating and Improvement System). c. Programs that meet national a ccreditation standards are able to meet all or part of the quality improvement standards (e.g., content of the standards is the same, an altern ative pathway exists to meeting the standards). d. Programs that meet all or part of state/territory schoolage quality standards. e. Other. Describe: 7.3.4 Do the state/territory's quality standards build on its licensi ng requirements and other regulatory requirements? No Yes. If yes, check any links between the state/territory's qual ity standards and licensing requirements. a. Requires that a provider meet basic licensing requirements t o qualify for the base level of the QRIS. b. Embeds licensing into the QRIS. c. State/territory license is a \"rated\" license. d. Other. Describe: 7.3.5 Does the state/territory provide financial incentives and other supports designed to expand the full diversity of child care options and help child care pr oviders improve the quality of services that are provided thro ugh the QRIS or another system o f quality improvement. No Yes. If yes, check all that apply. a. If yes, indicate in the table be low which categories of care re ceive this support.

The Office of the State Superint endent of Education (OSSE) coll ects data using the Classroom Assessment Scoring Syst em (CLASS) PreK, the Infant a nd Toddler Environmental Rating Scale (ITERS) and the Family Child Care En vironmental Rating Scale (FCCERS), which are used to evaluate progress and determine are as in which supports are needed. In order to better a ssess quality in the District, OSSE has transitioned from thresholds, which were previousl y reported against, to a system of floors and targets. ITERS and FCCERS yield programl evel observation scores on a sc ale of 1 to 7; for both ITERS and FCCERS the floor is 3 and the target is 6. CLASS yiel ds three programlevel domain scores on a scale of 1 to 7 for CLASS, floors are 4.5 fo r the Emotional Support and Classroom Organization domains and2 for the Instructional S upport domain. Targets are 5 for the Emotional Support and Classroom Organization doma ins and four for the Instructional Support domain. A dditionally, OSSE aims to have a t least 50 percent of child development programs with designations of quality or high quali ty during the performance period. Currently, 41. 2 percent of child developmen t facilities participating in the subsidized child care pro gram have a designation of qual ity or high quality. 7.4 Improving the Supply and Quality of Child Care Programs and Ser vices for Infants and Toddlers Lead Agencies are required to spe nd 3 percent of their total CC DF expenditures on activities to improve the supply and quality of their infant an d toddler care. This is in addition to the general quality setaside requirement.

Developing infant and toddler components within the early learning and developmental guidelines. Describe: The Office of the Stat e Superintendent of Education (OSSE) published the updated District of Columbia Early Learning Standards (DC ELS) in 2019. The updated edition of the DC ELS is a response to the evolution of the standards movement in early care and education throughout the country. The DC ELS include alignment with the Common Core State Standards for English Language Arts and Mathematics (2010) as well as the Next Generation Science Standards (2013). The standards are also aligned with the Head Start Early Learning Outcomes Framework: Ages Birth to Five (2015), thus ensuring that all children receive the same standardsbased instruction and appropriate learning experiences regardless of program auspices. DC ELS are researchbased and intentionally broken down by agelevels appropriate for the growth and development continuum. Those age levels include infants, toddlers, 2s, preschoolers, preK and kindergarten to ensure developmentally appropriate practice (DAP) and standards by subject. DC ELS also include ind icators for infants, toddlers, 2s and preschoolers, as well as exit expectations for children leaving pre K and kindergarten. These standards provide parents and teachers with information about expectations for what children know and are able to do and describe how children progress at various ages and development levels. They focus on the whole child and include a broad range of domains because young children's learning and development are interrelated and cross all areas of learning.

Establishing system s to collect real time data on availabl e (vacant) slots in ECE settings, by age of child, quality level, and location of program. Describe: . The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) coordinates with the child care res ource and referral (CCR&R) grantee on collecting vacancy information at the same time they are confirming the facility's open/closed status. The information is tracked through a data system showing a breakdown by age, location and quality level. n. Other. Describe: 7.4.2 Describe the measurable indica tors of progress relevant to subs ection 7.4 that the state/territory will use to evaluate its progress in improving the quality of child care programs and services for infants and toddlers within the state /territory and the data on the extent to which the state or territory has met these mea sures. Through Capital Quality, the District's Quality Rating and Impr ovement System (QRIS), the Office the State Superint endent of Education (OSSE) meas ures the quality of child care programs serving infants and toddlers using the Infant and Toddler Rating Scale (ITERS) (for child development centers) and the Family Child Ca re Environmental Rating Scale (FCCERS) (for child develop ment homes and expanded homes) . ITERS is an observation measure designed to assess programs serving childre n from birth to 30 months. It measures spatial, pro grammatic and interpersonal fea tures of the program environment. FCCERS is an observation measure designed to asses s family child care programs conducted in a provider's home for children from infan cy through school age. Similarly, it measures spatial, programmatic and interpersonal features of the program environment. These two measures contain measurable indicators t hat can help OSSE to track progress related to improvements in the health and safety of children (e.g., adequate space and furnishings, appropriate personal care routi nes) for infant and toddlers in centerbased care and familyhome provider care. Sp ecifically, programs will see increased progress toward the target scores ( e.g., 6) for t he ITERS and FCCERS subscales and increases in the percentage of programs achieving \"quality\" and \"high quality\" designations in Capital Quality. We will also see meas urable indicators of increased health and safety practices as indicated by reduction s in reports of serious injuries and health and safety v iolations during unannounced vi sits by licensing specialists. 7.5 Child Care Resource and Referral A Lead Agency may expend funds to establish, expand, or maintai n a statewide system of child care resource and referral services (98.53(a)(5)). It can be coordinated, to the extent determined appropriate by the Lead Agency, by a statewide publi c or private nonprofit, communitybased, or regionally based lead child care resource a nd referral organization (658E(c)(3)(B)(iii)). This effort m ay include activities done b y local or regional child care and resource referral agencies , as discussed in section 1.7. 7.5.1 What are the services provided b y the local or regional child c are and resource and referral agencies? The Office of the State Superint endent of Education (OSSE) prov ides a grant to a local communitybased organiz ation to operate the statewide child ca re resource and referral (CCR&R) system, providing familie s and providers with responsiv e services and evidencebased supports that promote improved a ccess to high quality early ca re and education in the District of Columbia. The CCR&R includes a hotline, two walkin service centers with lending libraries, and a website to improve access to and awareness of community r esources that improve family engagement and the homeschool connection. 7.5.2 Describe the measurable indica tors of progress relevant to subs ection 7.5 that the state/territory will use to evaluate its progress in improving the quality of child care programs and services within the state/territory and the data o n the extent to which the state or territory has met these measures. The child care resource and ref erral (CCR&R) sy stem tracks eac h contact made with families, providers and others made over the phone, by email, o n their website and in person. This information is tracked in a QuickBase application and is reviewed and analyzed on a monthly basis. Enrollment, attendance and profess ional development offerings are also tracked to hel p better coordinate services f or families and providers. Measurable indicators include: th e numbers of contacts made wit h families (e.g., for child care referrals) and provid ers (e.g., for technical assist ance); visits to the website and lending libraries; books and othe r resources downloaded and bor rowed from the website and lending libraries; a nd enrollment and attendance at the professional development trainings. 7.6 Facilitating Compliance with State Standards 7.6.1 What activities does your stat e/territory fund with CCDF qualit y funds to facilitate child care providers' compliance with state/territory health and safety re quirements? These requirements may be related to in spections, monitoring, trainin g, compliance with health and safety standards, and with state/territory licensing standards as outlined in Section 5. Describe: The Office of the State Superint endent of Education (OSSE) uses state funds to facilitate child care providers' compliance with health and safety requirements. Financial supports includes funding of criminal ba ckground checks fire inspections and tra ining and professional development. The District's training and professional developme nt requirements are enumerated in the Child Developm ent Facility Licensing Regulati ons. Training requirements include preservice, orientation and annual health and safety t raining; courses in the DC Early Learning Standards (DC ELS), the District's early learning and developmental guidelines, and courses in developmentally approp riate methods of positive beha vior intervention and support. As a result of the upda ted DC ELS, a training and prof essional development rollout plan was developed. Training of trainers has been held for both communitybased organizations and local educatio n agencies on the updated stand ards. Additionally, the required health and safety trainings are provided through both online (Quorum elearning platform) and in person. Health and safety training requirement s can be tracked for each individual employee through a tracker embedded in the dashboard of the Professional Development Information System ( PDIS). OSSE has intentionally i ncreased the availability of training and supports related to socialemotional/behavioral de velopment and mental health intervention models in response to the need. OSSE also works through partners hips internally (i.e., Strong S tart), and with other DC agencies (e.g., the Department o f Behavioral Health, or DBH, an d DC Health) to provide trainings to providers. Trainings are also provided through the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) P art C and Part B programs, Strong Start a nd Early Stages, respectively. Community of practice meetings are held monthly for providers p articipating in Capital Quality, DC's redesigned Quality Rating and Improvement System (QRIS). In addition to the previously mentioned courses, O SSE also provides access to an o nline learning platform to providers that allows them to tak e courses towards the Child De velopment Associate (CDA) credential, some of the licensi ng requirements, as well as cour se offerings on resiliency, trauma and behavior management. 7.6.2 Does the state/territory provide financial assistance to suppor t child care providers in complying with minimum health and safety requirements? No YES. If yes, which types of providers can access this financial assistance? a. Licensed Child Care Development Fund ( CCDF) providers b. Licensed nonChild Care Development Fund (CCDF) providers c. Licenseexempt Child Care Development Fund (CCDF) providers d. Other. Describe: 7.6.3 Describe the measurable indica tors of progress relevant to subs ection 7.6 that the state/territory will use to evaluate its progress in improving the quality of child care programs and services within the state/territory and the data o n the extent to which the state or territory has met these measures. The Office of the State Superint endent of Education (OSSE) trac ks progress in improving the quality of child care through the District's Quality Rating and Improvement and System (QRIS), Capital Quality. As a foundational basis for health and safety (the baseline for quality), child development facili ties must comply with the chi ld care requirements and OSSE staff ensures that these facilit ies meet these minimum standard s of care. In Capital Quality includes has five quality designations (Preliminary, HighQuali ty, Quality, Progressing and Developing) and reimbursement rat es increase in relation to hig her quality designations. A program's level of quality is ba sed on points earned on a ratin g scale. 7.7 Evaluating and Assessing the Quality and Effectiveness of Child Care Programs and Services 7.7.1 Does the state/territory measure the quality and effectiveness of child care programs and services in both child care centers and family child care h omes? No Yes. If yes, describe any tools used to measure child, family, teacher, classroom, or provider improvements, and ho w the state/territory evaluates how those tools positively impact children. Capital Quality, the District's Quality Rating and Improvement System (QRIS) yields ratings of program qualit y that correspond to one of fiv e Capital Quality designations: Developing, Progressing, Quality, HighQuality an d preliminary. The Capital Quality designations enable the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) to monitor and track the progress of child development centers and homes regarding the extent to which programs delive r increasingly highquality programming over time. The ratings are calculated using observable indicators of qualit y from the Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS) PreK, the Infan t and Toddler Environmental Rat ing Scale (ITERS) and the Family Child Car e Environmental Rating Scale (F CCERS) for programs serving infants and toddlers. 7.7.2 Describe the measurable indica tors of progress relevant to subs ection 7.7 that the state/territory will use to evaluate its progress in improving the quality of child care programs and services in child care centers and family child ca re homes within the state/territory and the data on the extent to which the state o r territory has met these measures. The Capital Quality ratings are c alculated using observable ind icators of quality from the Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS) PreK, the Infant and Toddle r Environmental Rating Scale (ITERS) and the Family Child Car e Environmental Rating Scale (F CCERS) for programs serving infants and toddlers. The first ratings under Capital Quality occurred in fall 2019. Although the Office of the State Superintendent of Educatio n (OSSE) expected to complete t he second ratings under Capital Quality in fall 2020, OSSE suspe nded CLASS PreK, ITERS and FCC ERS data collection and canceled the rating process during the coronavirus (COVID19) public hea lth emergency. The baseline data from the first ratings show: 16 percent designated HighQuality ; 35 percent designated Quality; 45 percent designated Progressing; and four percent designated Dev eloping of 172 total licensed, participating facilities (as of Dec. 1, 2020) rated in fall 201 9. An additional 58 licensed, participating facilities are designated Prelim inary because they did not have two years of observation data for, or started participation in the Q RIS after, the fall 2019 rating p rocess. To ensure facilities' tiered reimbursement rates are not lowered upon initially participatin g in Capital Quality, OSSE implemented the hold harmless po licy; while subject to the hold harmless policy, effected facilities may be reimbursed at a tiered reimbursement rate higher than th at aligned to the Capital Quality designation corresponding to their rating. 7.8 Accreditation Support 7.8.1 Does the state/territory support child care providers in the vo luntary pursuit of accreditation by a national accrediting body with demonstrated, valid, and re liable program standards of high quality? a.

Describe the measurable indica tors of progress relevant to subs ection 7.8 that the state/territory will use to evaluate its progress in improving the quality of child care programs and services within the state/territory and the data on the extent to which the state o r territory has met these measures. Although the District has no pla ns for accreditation developmen t, child development homes and centers participating in Capital Quality, the District's Qualit y Rating and Improvement System (QRIS) complete a selfassessment based on 10 quality indicators that are aligned to national accreditation standards (e.g., National Associ ation for the Education of Youn g Children, or NAEYC, National Association for Family Child C are). The 10 quality indicators a re: 1) curriculum and instruction are aligned to the DC Early Learning Standards (DC EL S); 2) formal and informal assessments are aligned to curriculum; 3) formal and informal assessments are implement ed; 4) data are used to inform instructional and professional p ractices Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS) PreK, the Infant and Toddler Environmental Rating Scale (ITERS) and/or th e Family Child Care Environmental Rating Scale (FCCERS) are used t o inform instructional and prof essional practices); 5) culturally and linguistically responsive practices are implemented; 6) inclusi on practices are implemented; 7) developmental screenings are implemented; 8) early care and edu cation professionals meaningfully engage in professional development; 9) family engagement promot es positive and goaloriented relationships; and 10) mission sta tements are reflective of bot h the program and the families served. Accreditation is not mandatory a nd is not a component of the QR IS; however, based on provider and stakeholder feedback, accreditat ion status (if applicable) is d isplayed on facility profiles on My Child Care DC. 7.9 Program Standards 7.9.1 Describe how the state/territory supports state/territory or lo cal efforts to develop or adopt highquality program standards, including standards for: a. Infants and toddlers b. Preschoolers c. and/or Schoolage children. Efforts to develop highquality program standards are supported through the District's Quality Rating and Improvement System (QRIS), Capital Quality. A key element of the QRIS is supporting programs in developing a Continuous Quality Improvement Plan (CQIP), which includes a set of q uality standards that are comm on to all programs serving children birth to age 5. As part of the CQIP, programs are supp orted in designing and implementing quality improvement strategies, in addition to bei ng provided with targeted support by quality fac ilitators (i.e., coaches) who wo rk with the home provider or center director to monitor, track and measure progress. In a ddition, the District provides a child care resource and referral (CCR&R) organizatio n and the Quality Improvement Network (QIN). These programs provide training and technical assistance to support providers in maintainin g healthy, safe and enriching environments. Additionally, the District promu lgated new licensing regulation s in December 2016 that incorporate key components of th e Caring for Our Children stand ards. Included in the licensing regulations are higher education requirements for sta ff. With the passage of the District's Healthy Tots Act in 2014, child development faciliti es serving more than 50 percent subsidyeligible childre n are required to participate i n the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP). The Healthy Tots Act provides an addition al enhancement to each meal as an incentive and ou tlines standards for promoting children's physical health and wellbeing. The Office of the State Superintendent of Educa tion (OSSE) partners with the Department of Behavioral Health (DBH) to provide mental hea lth consultants for child development facilities participating in the QIN and the P reK Enhancement and Expansion Program (PKEEP) throu gh the Healthy Futures program. The Healthy Futures program is also working to expa nd to child development centers located in wards 7 and 8 participating in the subsidized child care program. 7.9.2 Describe the measurable indica tors of progress relevant to subs ection 7.9 that the state/territory will use to evaluate its progress in improving the quality of child care programs and services within the state/territory and the data o n the extent to which the state or territory has met these measures. The Capital Quality 10 quality ind icators are aligned with nati onal accreditation standards (e.g., National Association for the Educ ation of Young Children, or NA EYC, National Association for Family Child Care, etc.) and are a part of the selfassessment that all participating providers complete. The selfassessment wa s updated in fall 2020 with the goal of being able to measure change and improvements over time. Capital Quality includes 10 quality indicators that are used for providers to complete a webbased selfassessment of t heir programs. Capital Quality requires programs to address the following program elements: 1. Curriculum and instruction are a ligned to DC Common Core Early Learning Standards; 2. Formal and informal assessments are aligned to curriculum; 3. Formal and informal assessments are implemented; 4. Data are used to inform instructional and professional practice s; o CLASS PreK and/or ITERSR and/or FCCERSR results are used to inform instructional and professional practices. 5.

Describe: The District of Columbia seeks t o address racial and social ine quities throughout the city by improving the wellbeing of child ren from birth and continuing through early childhood. The Office of the State Superint endent of Education (OSSE), Div ision of Early learning (DEL) in 2019 combined three grants previou sly separated grants supporti ng Quality Rating and Improvement System (QRIS), child care resource and referral (CC R&R) and the Shared Services Business Alliance (SSBA) into one grant, the Building and Sustaining Quality Early Care and Education Grant, with th ree program areas to align the strategies and enhance collaboration and coordination amo ng programs. The goal of this grant is to build the capacity of DC's early care and education system to expand and enhance quality services for young children and their families. This grant supports activiti es that address the identified and documented business and admi nistrative needs of child devel opment facility owners, center directors and child devel opment home caregivers and acti vities that support positive, goaloriented communications and relationships with parents/gua rdians in their role as their child's first and most important teacher. The grant objectives are: improve the quality of early learning environments; str engthen partnerships and commun ication with parents to enhance knowledge; increase acce ss to quality resources, referr als and supports for families; improve program participation an d outcomes for children and fam ilies; increase successful linkages for families and provid ers to needed services and supp orts; and improve the diversity and equity of outcomes for young children in programs and services. Other measurable indicators for the CCR&R and the SSBA include: the numbers of contacts made with families (e.g., for ch ild care referrals) and provide rs (e.g., for techni cal assistance); visits to the website and lending libraries; book s and other re sources downloaded and borrowed from the website and lending libraries; number of prov ider participants, and enrollment and attendance at the professional development train ings. December 2020, OSSE was awarded t he Supporting Equitable Educat or Development (SEED) grant from the Trust for Learning. The SEED grant will enhance professional development through the Building and Sustaining Quality Early Care and Educ ation Grant. The goal of the SEED grant is to improve the outcomes for all children by addre ssing racial and social inequities. Through meaningful culturally relevant professional learning experiences, the grant aims to reduce implicit bi ases and develop antibias prac tices within the early learning 246 | P a g e workforce using a train the trainer model. The planned train the trainer a pproach is designed to ensure th e District's early educator workforce has access to meaningful training and resources that enable them to develop the requisite skills, knowledge, and appreciation of diversity to c reate culturally responsive ideal learning environments for all yo ung children and families in DC . Furthermore, as the District s eeks to have strong policies, fun ding and programs that support our goals, there is a lo ngterm need and vision for an Early Childhood Integrated Data System (ECIDS). In March 2021, OSSE secured a vendor, thro ugh a competitive process, that will build an integrated dat a system for child care subsid y case management and payment system, the licensing data system, workforce and QRIS.
