What Terrorism Is, and Is Not Terrorism is \"the unlawful use of force and violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives .\" Federal Bureau of Investigation 28 CFR \u00a7 0.85 Terrorism , as described by the FBI, is always directed toward government al or political or ideological objectives. The use of violence is common to all forms of terrorism . Also common is the intention to intimidate , either an individual or (more often) a political or religious institution. In addition, terrorism is sometimes categorized as either domestic or international, referring , not to where the terrorist act takes place, but to the origin s of those responsible for it. Much debate has taken place over the motivations for terrorism. Traditi onally , it has been thought to reflect religious, political, or ideological beliefs, and that the targets of the attacks are symbolic in some way. Sparking fear in victims and the public appears to be the most common motivating element. Recent research s uggests , however, that motivations may include personal desire s by perpetrators to enhance their membership in the terrorist community by jockeying for internal domin ance (CSIS, 2020; DOHS, 2021). Terrorist acts have occurred throughout history but after the Oklahoma City bombing (1995) and the events of September 11, 2001 such events became a new focus of public consciousness in the United States . Terrorists may not only include those working on be half of religious or political organizations \u2014such as those who organized the 9/11 attacks \u2014but also individuals working on their own to subvert certain institutions . Sometimes groups will claim responsibility for another 's terrorist action to build notorie ty for themselves . Unfortunately, terrorism is a frightening reality for Americans. Mass Shootings Distinguished from Terrorism The Patriot Act defines domestic terrorism as an attempt to \"intimidate or coerce a civilian population; to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping\" (Myre, 2017). It can be hard to explain why domestic violence is distinguished from a mass shooting (Jenkins & Dadda rio, 2017). A mass gun shooting is defined as an incident involving multiple victims of gun violence. The United States Congressional Research Services clarifies that a public mass shooting is where the perpetrator selects four or more people and shoots th em with firearms in an indiscriminate manner . The mass casualty attack has no identifiable nexus with any terrorist organization, extremist ideology, or any other political purpose. Yet people want to emphasize the terrible nature of what they experienced by attaching the label of terrorism where none exists (Jenkins & Daddario, 2017). Increasingly, the United States has experienced violent events that some incorrectly identify as domestic terrorism . The following list of mass shooting events, but not terrorist acts, is by no means complete: Virginia Tech , 2007 Sandy Hook Elementary School , Newtown, CT , 2012 An Aurora , Colorado movie theater , 2012 The Boston Marathon , 2013 San Bernardino, CA , 2015 An Orlando, FL nightclu b, 2016 An outdoor concert in Las Vegas, NV October 1, 2017 A bar in CA , 2018 A Walmart in El Paso, Texas , 2019 An entertainment district in Dayton, O H, 2019 A gas station in Springfield, MO , 2020 Several massage spas in Atlanta GA, 2021 A grocery store i n Colorado, March 2021 Mass shootings that have occurred in the last five years are compiled in a database by the Violence Project. Sadly, these events represent only a sample of the violen ce against the public in the last decade (Myers, 2017). These events justifiably elicit very strong reactions in people, and they have much in common with terrorism, but we have noted the important distinction. They were not ideological, but personal. Nevada and Terrorism As Nevadans became acutely aware in October 2017 with the mass shooting outside the Mandalay Bay Resort in Las Vegas during a country western concert, terrifying events can be perpetrated by a single person using no weapons of mass destruction (chemical, biological, or radiological materials) and fueled only by intense personal reasons . Such events have sparked calls for tighter gun control, but the issues are complex. States vary on their own legislation against terrorism. Nevada does have crim inal penalties for Acts of Terrorism or Attempted Acts of Terrorism, which w ere passed in the aftermath of 9/11. Nevada law ( NRS 202.448) makes it a crime for any threat related to terrorism with the intent to injure or alarm someone, cause civil unrest, profit, or interfere with government operations. Even if nobody was hurt, a person can be convicted of a terrorist threat, which is a category B felony in Nevada and may include fines as well as up to 20 years in Nevada State Prison. Examples include calling in a threat to a place of worship, sending threatening letters to city hall , and sending texts of harm to Planned Parenthood. In addition, m aking a bogus bomb threat is considered a serious felony. YouTube: Crime of Terrorist threats in Nevada (1:37, 2 016) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGZ75YGPvso What Is Being Done? The U.S. government was actively working to combat terrorist threats even before September 11, 2001 and increased its efforts afterward. Government intelligence agencies are focused on patterns of potential crime , including terrorism, and there is heated debate between those who favor open access to phones and emails in order to identify potential threats, and those who fiercely want to protect an individual's privacy. Currently , for the general public as well as for healthcare workers, education about the proper responses to terrorist activities, along with thorough emergency preparedness, is the best available defense. Healthcare professionals are trained to deal with the physical resu lts and injuries from any event ; however , the effects of terrorist acts are often more than physical injuries. Emotional and spiritual reactions loom large among citizens, not only among those at the actual attack but also others locally and beyond. Healthcare workers need to be prepared to address fear, even in patients who have sustained little or no physical injury. Psychological and emotional reactions must be addressed along with the more obvious wounds sustained by victims. Analysis of these events , and responses to them , have resulted in a large body of resources for individuals and organizations seeking to educate and prepare themselves. Th e changing nature of the internet means that some of these resources may come and go, but websites maintained by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), and the CDC remain up-to-date and valuable for i ndividuals and institutions. The State of Nevada continues to update its websites and resource links. Contact information and links to both state and federal resources appear at the end of Module 7. 2. WMD and Terrorism Weapons of Mass Destruction Weapons of mass destruction (WMD) is a term that has become increasingly familiar through its use in the media. Not everyone means precisely the same thing when they use the term, but the definition used by the U.S. military may be the simplest and most generally understood. WMD are . . . chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear weapons capable of a high order of destruction or causing mass casualties (DOD, 201 9). The use of biological weapons was cited as early as two thousand years ago when the Assyrians p oisoned the public well of their enemies with ergot fungus. In the fourteen th century , the Tartars poisoned with plague the city of Kaffa (now in the Ukraine), which poisoning eventually created one of the great pandemics of Europe. Within our nation, earl y colonial British soldiers used soiled bedding of smallpox victims to infect Native Americans during the French and Indian wars (Flora, 2020). The use of bioterrorism continued to expand during World War I with the use of mustard gas; despite international treaties proscribing chemical weapons, World War II saw experiments with plague, nerve agents , and even anthrax on prisoners in various countries of the Axis . In the 1960s , only four countries had ability to develop biological weapons ; this is compare d to more than twenty countries who had that capability by the late 1990s. Today , recipes for making biological weapons and explosives are readily accessible to anyone on the internet. The possibility that terrorists might resort to the use of weapons of mass destruction is of grave concern. The four types of WMD vary in their ability to cause damage, in their ease of production and use, in the kinds of physical and human damage they can be expected to cause, and in their likelihood of use by terrorist organizations. All four types of WMD offer both advantages and obstacles to their perpetrators . Some require a certain level of skill, others require access to controlled or illegal substances, and still others require significant capital and the cooperation of people in positions of security or power. Some weapons could produce significant damage with high death tolls, while the greatest effects of others would be widespread panic and expensive cleanup operations. Bioterrorism and Chemical Terrorism The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) define bioterrorism as: . . . biological agents (microbes or toxins) used as weapons to further personal or political agendas. Acts of bioterrorism range from a single exposure directed at an individual by another individual to government- sponsored biological warfare resulting in mass casualties. Bioterrorism differs from other methods of terrorism in that the materials needed to make an effective biological agent are readily available, require little specialized knowledge and are inexpensive to produce (CDC, 2020). Video: Bioterr orism (5:56, 2016) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgPUkgZ4C3s According to the CDC: A chemical emergency occurs when a hazardous chemical has been released and the release has the potential for harming people's health. Chemical releases can be unintention al, as in the case of an industrial accident, or intentional, as in the case of a terrorist attack (CDC, 2018a). Some chemicals that are hazardous have been developed by military organizations for use in warfare beginning in World War I. Examples are nerve agents such as sarin and VX, mustards such as sulfur mustards and nitrogen mustards, and choking agents such as phosgene. It is possible for terrorists to get these chemical warfare agents and use them to harm people (CDC, 2018a). Since the World War I and II, there has been research and stockpiling of chemicals by many countries, but mutual nonproliferation agreements have generally prevailed. In 1997 the United States ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention Treaty (CWC), agreeing to destroy any remain ing stockpiles of chemical warfare agents no later than April 29, 2012 (CDC, 2018b). One hundred ninety -three (193) countries have signed all or elements of the CWC, which not only requires destruction of chemical weapons but prohibits, among other things, developing, producing, acquiring, stockpiling, and transferring of these weapons (NTI, 2021; ACA, 2018). Only Egypt, North Korea, and South Sudan have not signed the CWC or acceded to the convention. Many hazardous chemicals that have been used in biolog ical terrorism are used in industry (e.g., chlorine, ammonia, benzene ). Others are found in nature (e.g., poisonous plants ). Some could be made from everyday items such as household cleaners. These types of hazardous chemicals could be maliciously obtained and used to harm people, or they could be accidentally released (CDC, 2018b). The techniques for making destructive chemical weapons are well understood and the necessary equipment is commonly available. Once made, these weapons can be easily concealed. I n 1995 a Japanese cult group known as Aum Shinrikyo made and dispersed the nerve agent sarin several times in the Tokyo subway, killing 17 people and sending 5,500 to the hospital. These incidents made it clear that even small groups could manage the manuf acture and dispersion of deadly chemical weapons (NTI, 2021). Chemical and Biological Weapons Chemical weapons use the toxic properties of chemicals to cause harm and even death. Only a relatively small amount of a chemical agent is needed to produce significant physical and psychological effect. Historically, chemical weapons have been the most widely used and proliferated type of WMD, but they receive far less attention than do biological and nuclear weapons (NTI, 2021). The difference between a chemical and biological weapon is that a chemical weapon uses the toxic property of a chemical, whereas the biological weapon uses the toxic property of biological pathogens. Biological weapons utilize microorganisms and natural toxins to produce disease in humans , animals, or plants, and \"gram -for-gram, . . . are the deadliest weapons ever produced \" (NTI, 2021). Derived from a variety of sources, these compounds, when paired with a delivery system, become weapons. The potential danger of a given weapon is measured by its lethality \u2014how effectively it kills; its infectivity \u2014how easily it spreads; and its virulence \u2014how likely it is to cause disease. Other important considerations include how easily is it dispersed, whether it can be treated medically, whether there is a vaccine, what dosage is needed to cause disease , and the compound's stability. Chemical and biological weapons are financially and logistically easier to acquire than are radiologic or nuclear weapons. They cause more casualties and have a greater psychological impact than conventional weapons, but cause less destruction than devices involving radiation. Chemical weapons are somewhat easier than other weapons for terrorist groups (or even individuals) to manufacture because the manufacturing knowledge is readily available, many precursor chemicals have legitimate uses and are thus legally available, there is poor security around these chemicals in some countries, and small chemical manufacturing equipment is commonly available. Radiologic and Nuclear W eapons Radiologic and nuclear weapons rely on the same sources for damage \u2014explosive power and radiation \u2014but there is a distinction in their forms. In addition, true nuclear weapons produce tremendous heat, which can cause burns and start fires. In the last fifty years, most radiation injuries have been the result of accidents; however, the intentional deployment of a nuclear or radiologic device is a potential terrorist threat (NTI, 2015 a, b, c, d). Modern nuclear threats can be divided into five general categories: An attack on nuclear power plants A malevolent act using simple radiologic devices Terrorist use of a radiologic dispersal device Detonation of an improvised nuclear device Detonation of a sophisticated nuclear weapon (Dainiak, 2018) Both radiologic and nuclear devices can damage and contaminate any living organism from the epicenter of exposure widening to large perimeters. Incidents involving simple devices like Radiation Exposure Devices ( REDs) and Radiologic Dispersal Devices (RDDs)\u2014any device that causes intentional dissemination of radioactive material without a nuclear detonation \u2014could cause a limited number of casualties; however, those involving Improvised Nuclear Devices (INDs) and small nuclear weapons would result in mass ca sualties (ORISE, 2017). bombs\" \u2014are seen as more likely to be used by terrorists. These devices require only a little more skill than is needed to make a conventional bomb and their components are easier to acquire. RDDs utilize conventional explosives to disperse a radioactive material packaged in the device, as opposed to a nuclear device, which creates radiation with its explosion. While it is unlikely that many people would die from radiation poisoning as a result of the explosion of an RDD, there would be some deaths and injuries and the costs of cleanup could be considerable. These devices are attractive to some groups because they are relatively easy to create, and they will not generally do a great deal of damage, but they play on the heightened fear of radiation among the general public in order to cause widespread panic and disruption, which is often the group's real goal. Because of this, public education and good response preparation are important counter measures (ORISE, 2017). Nuclear weapons present significantly higher obstacles in terms o f the skill needed to produce them and the financial and logistical support needed to acquire materials, prepare the devices, and transport them (ORISE, 2017). The great concern is the potential for damage, injuries, and death is much higher because they a re significantly more powerful weapons. 3. Chemical Weapons Chemical weapons agents are classified as either nonpersistent or persistent. Nonpersistent agents dissipate within a few hours and are threatening specifically to the lungs. Persistent agents may take up to one month to dissipate if they have been deposited on soil, vegetation, or objects. They are most threatening to the skin. Video: What is a chemical weapon? (3:27, 2020) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Dpxz-YhxAU Scientists often categorize hazardous chemicals by the type of chemical or by the effects a chemical would have on people exposed to it. The categories used by the CDC are as follows: Biotoxins Poisons that come from plants Chemicals that severely blister the eyes, respiratory tract, and skin on contact: Mustards o Mustard gas (H) (sulfur mustard) o Mustard/lewisite (HL) o Nitrogen mustard (HN -1, HN-2, HN -3) o Sesqui mustard o Sulfur mustard (H) (mustard gas) Lewisites/chloroarsine agents o Lewisite (CX) Blood Agents Poisons that affect the body by being absorbed into the blood : Arsine (SA) Carbon monoxide Cyanide o Cyanogen chloride (CK) o Hydrogen cyanide (AC) o Potassium cyanide (KCN) o Sodium cyanide (NaCN) Sodium monofluoroacetate (compound 1080) Caustics (a cids) Chemicals that burn or corrode people's skin, eyes, and mucus membranes (lining of the nose, mouth, throat, and lungs) on contact : Hydrofluoric acid (hydrogen fluoride) Hydrogen chloride Choking/Lung/Pulmonary Agents Chemicals that cause severe irritation or swelling of the respiratory tract (lining of the nose, throat, and lungs) : Ammonia Bromine (CA) Chlorine (CL) Hydrogen Sulfuryl fluoride Incapacitating agents Drugs that make people unable to think clearly or that cause an altered state of consciousness including unconsciousness: BZ Fentanyls and other opioids Long- acting anticoagulants Poisons that prevent blood from clotting properly, which can lead to uncontrolled bleeding and he morrhage: Super warfarin Metals Agents that consist of metallic poisons : Arsenic Barium Mercury Thallium Nerve agents Highly poisonous chemicals that work by preventing the nervous system from working properly : G agents o Sarin (GB) o Soman (GD) o Tabun (GA) V agents o VX Organic solvents Agents that damage the tissues of living things by dissolving fats and oils : Benzene Riot control agents/tear gas Highly irritating agents normally used by law enforcement for crowd control or by individuals for protection such as mace : Bromobenzylcyanide (CA) Chloroacetophenone (CN) Chlorobenzylidenemalononitrile (CS) Chloropicrin (PS) Dibenzoxazepine (CR) Toxic alcohols Poisonous alcohols that can damage the heart, kidneys, and nervous system : Ethylene glycol Vomiting agents Chemicals that cause nausea and vomiting : Adamsite (DM) (CDC, 2018b) Covert Chemical Release Since September 11, 2001, concern has increased about potential terrorist attacks involving the use of chemical agents. In addition, cases involving intentional or inadvertent contamination of food with chemicals highlighted the need for healthcare providers and public health officials to be alert for patients in their communities who have signs and symptoms consistent with chemical exposures (CDC, 2018b). Intentional release of chemical agents may be an overt event, one whose nature reveals itself, such as release of a nerve agent in a subway or a large explosion of a chemical container. On the other hand, a chemical release might be a covert or hidden event. In a covert release of a biological or chemical agent, the presence of sick people could be the first sign of an exposure. Causes of these contaminants could include deliberate contamination of food, water, or a consumer product. Often only after numerous people present with similar symptoms can healthcare professionals begin to identify the event. To increase the likelihood that healthcare providers recognize a chemical release-related illness, and that public health authorities will implement the appropriate emergency response and public health actions, the CDC has identified examples of chemical -induced illness (see table below under \"Identifying Chemical Agents\") and created appropriate guidance for healthcare providers and public health personnel (CDC, 2018b). The CDC recognizes that the covert release of a chemical agent might not be easily identified, for at least five reasons: Symptoms of exposure to some chemical agents such as ricin might be similar to those of common diseases such as gastroenteritis. Immediate symptoms of certain chemical exposures might be nonexistent or mild despite the risk for long- term effects. Examples include neurocognitive impairment from dimethyl mercury, teratogenicity from isotretinoin, or cancer from a flatoxin. Exposure to contaminated food, water, or consumer products might result in reports of illness to healthcare providers over a long period and in various locations. People exposed to two or more agents might have symptoms not suggestive of any one chemical agent and as a mixed clinical presentation. Healthcare providers might be less familiar with clinical presentations suggesting exposure to chemical agents than they are with illnesses that are treated frequently (CDC, 2018b). Epidemiologic Clues Identifying a covert release of a chemical agent may depend on healthcare professionals being astute as they begin to see victims of the release. First receivers are hospital -based emergency staff and may be in the best position to observe epidemiologic clu es that suggest such a release. These clues include: An unusual increase in the number of patients seeking care for potential chemical release -related illness. Unexplained deaths among young or healthy persons. Emission of unexplained odors by patients. Clusters of illness in persons who have common characteristics, such as drinking water from the same source. Rapid onset of symptoms after an exposure to a potentially contaminated medium such as paresthesia and vomiting within minutes of eating a meal. Unexplained death of plants, fish, or animals either domestic or wild. A syndrome (a constellation of clinical signs and symptoms in patients) suggesting a disease associated commonly with a known chemical exposure such as neurologic signs or pinpoint pupils in eyes of patients with a gastroenteritis -like syndrome or acidosis in patien ts with altered mental status (CDC, 2018b). Identifying Chemical Agents Because various chemical agents could be used as covert weapons, the actual clinical syndrome varies depending on the type of agent, the amount and concentration of the chemical, and t he route of the exposure. However, some clinical presentations may be more common with a covert chemical release. Certain syndromes are associated with groups of chemical agents with similar toxic properties that have been used previously, have high toxici ty, or are easily available (see table) (CDC, 2018b). Clinical Syndromes and Potential Chemical Etiologies* Category Clinical syndrome chemical or hypertension, mental status, and/or seizures Nicotine** Organophosphate insecticides**\u2014 decreased acetylcholinesterase activity Carbamate insecticides Medicinal carbamates (ex. physostigmine) Generalized muscle rigidity Seizure -like, generalized muscle contractions or painful spasms Strychnine \u2014intact sensorium (neck and limbs) and, usually, tachycardia and hypertension Oropharyngeal pain and ulcerations Lip, mouth, and pharyngeal ulcerations and burning pain Paraquat** \u2014dyspnea and hemoptysis secondary to pulmonary edema or hemorrhage; can progress to pulmonary fibrosis over mental status, dyspnea, hypotension, seizures, and metabolic acidosis and symptoms: muscle weakness and atrophy, \"glove and stocking\" sensory loss, and depressed or reflexes peripheral neuropathy Severe gastrointestinal illness, dehydration Abdominal pain, vomiting, profuse diarrhea (possibly bloody), and hypotension, possibly followed by multisystem organ failure Arsenic** Ricin** \u2014inhalation an additional route of severe respiratory illness possible Colchicine Barium \u2014hypokalemia common *Not intended as a complete differential diagnosis for each syndrome or as a list of all chemicals that might be used in a covert chemical release. **Potential agents for a covert chemical release based on historic use (intentional or inadvertent use), high toxicity, and/or ease of availability. ***Unreliable sign. Source: CDC, 2018b. As noted above, it is likely that a covert chemical release would b e first recognized by healthcare providers, public health agencies, and poison control centers as they become aware of patterns while assessing illness and treating patients. Familiarity of healthcare professionals with the general characteristics of a covert chemical release, plus recognition of epidemiologic clues and related clinical syndromes, could reduce morbidity and mortality as these workers implement the appropriate emergency response. Public health agencies and healthcare providers might render t he most appropriate, timely, and clinically relevant treatment possible by using treatment modalities based on syndromic categories such as burns, respiratory depression, neurologic damage, and shock. Because of the hundreds of new chemicals introduced glo bally each month, it is more pragmatic to treat exposed persons by clinical syndrome rather than specific agent (CDC, 2018b). Recognizing Specific Chemical Agents The CDC provide s many reference materials for recognizing and treating the effects of all typ es of chemical compounds. These include \"reference cards\" for dozens of individual chemical compounds that outline essential information for emergency and hospital personnel, including the type of personal protective clothing and equipment (PPE) needed when treating victims. While PPE is necessary for treating virtually anyone who has been exposed to a chemical agent, specifics vary according to the agent involved. It is critical to have this information on hand and for staff to be trained to consult with. Following are the CDC guidelines for two of the common categories of chemical agents \u2014vesicants and nerve agents. These guidelines provide information on recognizing signs and symptoms, initial treatment, and alternative diagnoses. Remember that the details will differ for other agents and you should always know how to access reference materials quickly at your facility. Vesicant (Blister Agent) Poisoning Vesicants, also referred to as \"blister agents,\" were the most commonly used chemical warfare agents during World War I. Likely routes of exposure are inhalation, dermal contact, and ocular contact. Vesicants are highly reactive chemicals that combine with proteins, DNA, and other cellular components to result in cellular changes immediately after exposure. Depending on the vesicant, clinical effects may occur immediately (as with phosgene oxime, lewisite) or may be delayed for 2 to 24 hours (as with mustards). Following exposure, the most commonly encountered clinical effects include dermal (skin erythema, b listering), respiratory (pharyngitis, cough, dyspnea), ocular (conjunctivitis, burns), and gastrointestinal (nausea and vomiting). The amount and route of exposure to the vesicant, the type of vesicant, and the premorbid condition of the person exposed con tribute to the time of onset and the severity of illness. For example, ingestion of a vesicant leads to gastrointestinal symptoms more than those that would result from inhalation exposure to the same dose and type of vesicant (CDC, 2018a). Signs and Sympt oms The following is a more comprehensive list of signs and symptoms that may be encountered in a person exposed to a vesicant. Signs and symptoms are not listed in order of presentation or specificity. It is important to note that partial presentations or an absence of some of the following signs/symptoms do not necessarily imply less severe disease. Respiratory signs and symptoms include: Chest tightness Clear rhinorrhea Cough Dyspnea Tachypnea Dermal signs and symptoms include: Blisters (within 1 hour with phosgene oxime, delayed for 2 to 12 hours with lewisite, delayed for 2 to 24 hours with mustards) Erythema (immediate with lewisite and phosgene oxime, may be delayed for 2 to 24 hours with mustards) Immediate blanching (phosgene oxime) Itching Necrosis and eschar (over a period of 7 to 10 days) Ocular signs and symptoms include: Blindness Blurred block and cardiac arrest (with high- dose exposure) Hypotension (with high -dose exposure to lewisite) Gastrointestinal signs and symptoms (prominent if ingestion is a route of exposure) include: Abdom inal pain Diarrhea (sometimes bloody) Hematemesis Nausea and vomiting Central nervous system signs and symptoms (with exposure to high doses) include: Ataxia Coma Convulsions Tremors Hematologic signs and symptoms: Anemia Bleeding/hemorrhage Bone marrow suppression Increased susceptibility to infection Leukocytopenia Thrombocytopenia (CDC, 2018a) Laboratory Findings Although it is a nonspecific finding, leukopenia can indicate vesicant exposure. It usually begins 3 to 5 days after exposure. With a white blood cell count <500, the prognosis is poor. Differential Diagnosis Barbiturates Bullous pemphigoid Chemotherapeutic agents Carbon monoxide Other chemical burns (e.g., with strong acids, bases, corrosives) Pemphigus vulgaris Stevens -Johnson syndrome Staphylococcus scalded skin syndrome Toxic epidermal necrolysis Note: The actual clinical manifestations of a vesicant exposure may be more variable than the syndrome described above (CDC, 2018a). Nerve Agents and Organophosphate (OP) Pesticide Poisoning Nerve agents are chemical warfare agents that have the same mechanism of action as organophosphate (OP) pesticides. They are potent inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase. Inhibition of acetylcholinesterase leads to an accumulation of acetylcholine in the central and peripheral nervous system. Excess acetylcholine produces a predictable cholinergic syndrome consisting of copious respiratory and oral secretions, diarrhea and vomiting, sweating, altered mental status, autonomic instabilit y, and generalized weakness that can progress to paralysis and respiratory arrest. The amount and route of exposure to the nerve agent or OP pesticide, the type of nerve agent or pesticide, and the premorbid condition of the exposed person contribute to the time of onset and the severity of illness. For example, inhalation of a nerve agent or an OP pesticide leads to a quicker onset of poisoning with more severe symptoms than dermal exposure, given the same amount of agent (CDC, 2018a). Signs and Symptoms The following are more comprehensive lists of signs and symptoms that may be encountered in a person exposed to a nerve agent or OP pesticide. Signs and symptoms are not listed in order of presentation or specificity. Also, partial presentat ions (an absence of some of the following signs/symptoms) do not necessarily imply less severe disease. Central nervous system signs and symptoms include: Miosis (unilateral or bilateral pupil constriction) Headache Restlessness Convulsions Loss of conscio usness Coma Respiratory signs and symptoms include: Rhinorrhea nose) Bronchorrhea (excessive rate/depth) Bradypnea (de creased respiratory rate) \u2014late Cardiovascular signs include: Tachycardia (increased heart rate) \u2014early Hypertension (high blood pressure) \u2014early Bradycardia (decreased heart signs and symptoms include: Abdominal pain Nausea and vomiting Diarrhea Urinary incontinence, frequency Musculoskeletal signs and symptoms include: Weakness (may progress to paralysis) Fasciculations (local or generalized) Skin and mucous membrane signs and symptoms include: Profuse sweating (local or generalized) Lacrimation (tear formation) Conjunctival injection Laboratory Findings Decreased plasma or red blood cell (RBC) is a choline sterase activity. Limitations of interpretation of results include the following: There is a wide normal range for enzyme activity that makes interpretation difficult without a baseline measurement. Cholinesterase activity correlates poorly with severity of local effects after vapor exposures. Plasma or RBC cholinesterase may be disproportionately inhibited depending on the particular nerve agent, amount of exposure, and time interval since exposure. Interpreting cholinesterase activity: Plasma cholinesterase Usually declines faster than RBC cholinesterase Is easier to assay than RBC cholinesterase Regenerates faster than RBC cholinesterase May have a day -to-day variation in enzyme activity as high as 20% Is less specific than RBC cholinesterase Can show false depression from liver disease, malnutrition, pregnancy, genetic deficiency, or drugs (e.g., codeine, morphine, cocaine, succinylcholine) Red blood cell cholinesterase Is a better reflection of CNS cholinesterase activity Is more specific test than plasma cholinesterase May have a day -to-day variation in enzyme activity as high as 10% Can show false depression from antimalarial therapy or pernicious anemia Differential Diagnosis Carbamate insecticides Medicinal (e.g., atracurium, vecuronium) Note : The actual clinical manifestations of an exposure to a nerve agent or an OP pesticide may be more variable than the syndrome described in this document (CDC, 2018a). 4. Biological Weapons From a scientific and medical perspective, bioterrorism\u2014using biological weapons to produce disease in humans \u2014can be viewed as a variation of the problem of emerging infectious diseases, and the only difference is that increased virulence or intentional release are deliberate acts. The United States public health system and primary healt hcare providers must be prepared to address various biological agents, including pathogens that are rarely seen in this country. Epidemiology of bioterrorism is the study of how disease is distributed among people and populations. Biological terrorism is n ot immediately obvious. Because most healthcare workers have never seen first -hand the clinical presentation of the Category A or B agents of biological destruction, it is important to have a basic knowledge of what to expect in a patient's symptoms. Important concepts are that symptoms are often insidious and slow to develop. Hospital personnel such as lab workers or pharmacist s may be the first to recognize unusual lab results from a culture strain, or an increased use of antibiotics. The case rate may help identify or relieve the concern of potential bioterrorism. Recognizing natural versus irregular patterns of normally occurring disease is part of the epidemiology of bioterrorism. Improving readiness and awareness is the first step in bioterrorism preparedness. Surveillance of emergency room visits, lab data, pharmacy use, and school absenteeism are all methods to improve awareness. Local and state health departments are key to public health surveillance programs. Each facility that recognizes suspiciou s patterns must notify their local health department. Covert vs. Overt Bioterrorism As with chemical agents, the intentional release of biological agents can be either covert or overt. A covert release is unannounced and hidden and may go unnoticed for da ys or even weeks. The presence of ill individuals may be the first sign of a release, and those infected may have inadvertently infected others. An infected person may seek medical care anywhere within the healthcare system, possibly at a distance from the release area. An overt release is immediately apparent and may even be announced. In an overt release, the healthcare system and public health officials may be overwhelmed by requests for information and treatment. Hospitals, clinics, emergency responders , and communication systems will be required to go into immediate service. An overt release has the potential to cause widespread panic. Whether the release is covert or overt, healthcare providers should be alert to illness patterns and diagnostic clues that indicate an unusual infectious disease outbreak that could be associated with intentional release of a biological agent. In addition, they should watch for increases in unexpected or unexplained illnesses and know how to activate the public health resp onse system if an outbreak is suspected. The Biological and Chemical Terrorism Strategic Plan established in 2000 is still in effect (CDC, 2001). Well-trained and educated first responders, first receivers, and public health personnel are essential to an organized and successful response. Improving Response to Biologically Induced Illness Healthcare providers, clinical laboratory personnel, infection control professionals, and public health departments play critical and complementary roles in the recognition and response to illness caused by the intentional release of biological agents. Syn drome descriptions, epidemiologic clues, and laboratory recommendations provide basic guidance that can improve recognition of these events (CDC, 2001). Since 9/11, state and local health departments have initiated activities to improve recognition, repor ting, and response, ranging from enhancing communications to conducting special surveillance projects. This includes active tracking for changes in the number of hospital admissions, emergency department visits, and occurrence of specific syndromes. Bioter rorism preparedness activities and work with emerging infectious diseases have helped public health agencies prepare for any intentional release of a biological agent . The CDC's Emergency Preparedness and Response website has links to and information on th e various tools available, as well as other resources. Recognizing Clinical Syndromes Work continues on syndromic surveillance projects and the CDC maintains current data on this research, which was established in 2003. The term syndromic surveillance mean s watching for health -related data that signal sufficient probability of any single case or outbreak to warrant further public health response. Historically, syndromic surveillance was used in investigating potential cases, but its utility for detecting ou tbreaks associated with bioterrorism is increasingly being explored by public health officials. Advancements in technology and the growth of programs and data have also affected these efforts (CDC, 2019). See also the CDC resource website at: http://emerge ncy.cdc.gov/bioterrorism/surveillance.asp The release of a biological agent may not have an immediate impact because of the delay between exposure and onset of illness, and because outbreaks associated with intentional releases may resemble naturally occurring ones. Nevertheless, healthcare workers should be familiar with indications of intentional release of a biological agent and know when, and to whom, to report a suspected outbreak. These indications include unusual clustering of illness, patients pres enting with clinical signs and symptoms that suggest an infectious disease outbreak, unusual age distribution for common diseases, and a large number of cases of similar symptoms. An example is a new onset of multiple cases presenting with acute flaccid pa ralysis, which may be suggestive of a release of botulinum toxin (CDC, 2019). Epidemiologic Clues Signal ing a Covert Bioterrorism Attack Large number of ill persons with similar disease or syndrome Large number of unexplained diseases, syndromes or death s Unusual illness in a population Higher morbidity and mortality than expected with a common disease or syndrome Failure of a common disease to respond to usual therapy Single case of disease caused by an uncommon agent Multiple unusual or unexplained disease entities coexisting in the same patient without other explanation Disease with an unusual geographic or seasonal distribution Multiple atypical presentations of disease agents Similar genetic type among agents isolated from temporally or spatially distinct sources Unusual, atypical, genetically engineered, or antiquated strain of agent Endemic disease with unexplained increase in incidence Simultaneous clusters of similar illness in non -contiguous areas, domestic or foreign Atypical aerosol, food, or water transmission Ill people presenting near the same time Deaths or illness among animals that precedes or accompanies illness or death in humans No illness Source: Das and Kataria, 2011. As noted earlier, a variety of factors affect the potential public health impact of an intentionally released biological agent: Lethality \u2014how effectively it kills Infectivity \u2014how easily it spreads Virulence \u2014how likely it is to cause disease How easily it is dispersed Availability of medical treatment and/or vaccine Dosage needed to cause disease Stability of the compound (NTI, 2021) It may be difficult to pinpoint the time and location of a biological agent's release because of the variation in incubation period among organisms. Some diseases show a rapid onset of symptoms and early treatment is critical. For example, plague has a rapid onset and is potentially fatal within 12 to 24 hours if untreated, and the botulism toxin also has a rapid onset and requires immediate supportive treatment. On the other ha nd, smallpox can be treated effectively by vaccination within 2 to 3 days of symptom onset. Smallpox, like plague, is highly contagious and has the potential to cause widespread panic, and in the case of smallpox, which is believed to have been eradicated, not enough vaccine exists should a widespread outbreak occur. Conversely, plague and anthrax, despite their potential for causing serious illness and death, are effectively treated with antibiotics such as Cipro. Categories of Diseases and Biological Agents Bioterrorism agents can be separated into three categories \u2014known as Category A, B and C \u2014depending on how easily they can be spread and the severity of illness or death they cause. Category A agents are considered the highest risk and Category C agents are those that are considered emerging threats for disease (CDC, 2018b). Category A Diseases or Agents Category A diseases or agents are high priority and include organisms that pose the highest risk to the public and national security and are of greatest concern for public health because they: Are easily spread or transmitted from person to person Result in high mortality rates and have the potential for major public health impact May cause public panic and social disruption Require special action for public health preparedness and recovery (CDC, 2018b) Category A bioterrorism agents are: Anthrax (Bacillus anthracis) Botulism (Clostridium botulinum (CDC, 2018b) Category B Diseases or Agents Category B diseases or agents are the second highest priority because they: Are moderately easy to disseminate Result in moderate illness rates and low mortality rates, and Require specific enhancements of CDC's diagnostic capacity and enhanced disease surveillance Category B diseases or agents include: Brucellosis (Brucella species) Epsilon toxin of Clostridium perfringens cholerae, Cryptosporidium pa rvum) (CDC, 2018b) Category C Diseases or Agents Category C diseases or agents are the third highest priority and include emerging pathogens that could be engineered for mass dissemination in the future because they: Are easily available Are easily produced and spread Have potential for high morbidity and mortality rates and major health impact Agents include emerging infectious diseases such as Nipah virus and hantavirus and now the coronavirus known as COVID -19. (CDC, 2018b) Clinical Fe atures of High- Priority Agents Four Category A diseases have been the focus of the CDC's efforts to educate the healthcare community about bioterrorism potential: anthrax, botulism, plague, and smallpox. The CDC does not prioritize these agents in any ord er of importance or likelihood of use. Other agents with bioterrorism potential include those that cause tularemia and viral hemorrhagic fevers, brucellosis, Q fever, viral encephalitis, and disease associated with staphylococcal enterotoxin. Other important category B agents include any organism that threatens the water or food supply. Anthrax Anthrax has been recognized as an infectious disease of animals and humans for millennia. Within the United States, animal anthrax is reported almost annually, but naturally occurring human anthrax is rare. Worldwide, however, the disease is common in wild and domestic animals and not uncommon among people who interact with animals in agricultural regions of South and Central America, sub- Saharan Africa, central and southwestern Asia, and southern and eastern Europe (CDC, 2020a). Bacillus anthracis , the causative agent forming, gram-positive, rod -shaped bacterium. Biodefense experts often place B. anthracis at or near the top of the list for potential threat agents. Inhalation anthrax is particularly deadly, as demonstrated by the 1979 accidental release of B. anthracis from a military microbiology facility in the Sverdlovsk region of Russia where 88% of patients (66/75) reported with inhalation anthrax died. In addition to animal exposure, humans have acquired disease from exposure to spores released purposefully as a bioterrorist weapon and accidentally from naturally occurring sources (CDC, 2020a) If a b ioterrorist attack were to happen, Bacillus anthracis would be one of the biological agents most likely to be used. Biological agents are germs that can sicken or kill people, livestock, or crops. Anthrax is one of the most likely agents to be used because : Anthrax spores are easily found in nature and can be produced in a lab and can last for a long time in the environment. Anthrax makes a good weapon because it can be released quietly and without anyone knowing. The microscopic spores could be put into po wders, sprays, food, and water. Because they are so small, you may not be able to see, smell, or taste them. Anthrax has been successfully used as a weapon before. (CDC, 2020a) Anthrax has been used as a weapon around the world for nearly a century. In 200 1 powdered anthrax spores were deliberately put into four letters that were mailed through the U.S. postal system. Twenty -two people, including 12 mail handlers, got anthrax, and five of these 22 people died. Five grams of anthrax killed five people and th e mail system, and the US capitol were shut down causing public fear. Source: Wikimedia Commons. A letter sent in 2001 to Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle contained anthrax powder. Beginning one week after the September 11 attacks, letters containing anthrax spores were mailed to several news media offices and two U.S. Senators, killing five people and infecting 17 others. On April 2, 1979, an outbreak of anthrax infection happened in Sverdlovsk, USSR. According to one version , the anthrax spores wer e accidentally released from the Cold War-era secret military facility causing anthrax outbreak. An official report stated 64 people died during April and June. In July 2016 nearly a hundred people have been hospitalized amid an anthrax outbreak from nom adic communities in northern Siberia, Russia and more than 2,300 reindeer died from anthrax infections in Yamalo -Nenets Autonomous Okrug. A 12-year- old child also died due to the outbreak. Scientists believe the summer melting unearthed the frozen carcass of a reindeer that died in the previous anthrax outbreak in 1968. Then, in June 2018, an outbreak of anthrax in France killed several thousand cattle (Wikipedia, 2021). Bacillus anthracis is a Tier 1 agent. A subset of select agents and toxins have been designated as Tier 1 because these biological agents and toxins present the greatest risk of deliberate misuse with significant potential for mass casualties or devastating effect to the economy, critical infrastructure, or public confidence, and pose a sev ere threat to public health and safety. There are four clinical forms of anthrax: cutaneous or skin, inhalation or respiratory tract, gastrointestinal, and injection. The injectable form of anthrax has occurred in northern Europe but has never been report ed in the United States (CDC, 2020a). Anthrax is not contagious ; it only affects the person exposed to its spores , in whose body it produces toxins that cause severe illness. Symptoms from all four types may take from 1 day to more than 2 months to appear. An anthrax attack could take many forms. For example, it could be placed in letters and mailed, as was done in 2001, or it could be put into food or w ater. Anthrax could be released into the air from a truck, building, or plane. This type of attack would mean the anthrax spores could easily be blown around by the wind or carried on people's clothes, shoes, and other objects. It only takes a small amount of anthrax to infect a large number of people. If anthrax spores were released into the air, people could breathe them in and become ill. Inhalation anthrax is the most serious form and it can kill quickly if not treated immediately. If the attack were not detected by one of the monitoring systems in place in the United States, it might go unnoticed until first responders begin to see unusual patterns of illness among people showing up at emergency rooms (CDC, 2020a, b, c). Cutaneous Anthrax When anthrax spores get into the skin, usually through a cut or scrape, a person has cutaneous anthrax. This can happen when a person handles infected animals or contaminated animal products like wool, hides, or hair. Cutaneous anthrax is most common on the head , neck, forearms, and hands. It affects the skin and tissue around the site of infection. Cutaneous anthrax is the most common form of anthrax infection, and it is also considered to be the least dangerous. Infection usually develops from 1 to 7 days after exposure. Without treatment, up to 20% of people with cutaneous anthrax may die. However, with proper treatment, almost all patients with cutaneous anthrax survive (CDC, 2020 b, c). Cutaneous anthrax symptoms can include: Small blisters or bumps causing itch Swelling around the sore A painless skin sore or ulcer with a black center that appears after the small blisters , most often on the face, neck, arms, or hands (CDC, 2020a, b, c) Inhalation Anthrax When a person breathes in anthrax spores, they can d evelop symptoms of inhalation anthrax, which is the most common routes of anthrax. People who work in places such as wool mills, slaughterhouses, and tanneries may breathe in the spores when working with infected animals or contaminated animal products fro m infected animals. Inhalation anthrax starts primarily in the lymph nodes in the chest before spreading throughout the rest of the body, ultimately causing severe breathing problems and, potentially , shock. Inhalation anthrax is considered to be the deadl iest form of anthrax. Infection usually develops within a week after exposure, but it can take up to 2 months. Without treatment, only about 10% to 15% of patients with inhalation anthrax may survive. However, with aggressive treatment, about 55% of patients survive (CDC, 2020a, b, c). Inhalation anthrax symptoms can include: Fever and chills Chest discomfort Shortness of breath Confusion or dizziness Cough Nausea, vomiting, or stomach pains Headache Profusive sweats Extreme fatigue Often absence of flu -like symptoms Body aches (CDC, 2020a, b, c) Gastrointestinal Anthrax When a person eats raw or undercooked meat from an animal infected with anthrax, they can develop gastrointestinal anthrax. Once ingested, anthrax spores can affect the upper gastrointestinal tract, beginning with the throat and esophagus, stomach, and intestines. Gastrointestinal anthrax has rarely been reported in the United States. Infection usually develops from 1 to 7 days after exposure. Without treatment, more than half of patients with gastrointestinal anthrax die. However, with proper treatment, 60% of patients survive (CDC, 2020a, b, c). Gastrointestinal anthrax symptoms can include: Fever and chills Swelling of neck or neck glands Sore throat Painful swallowing Hoarseness Nausea and vomiting, especially bloody vomiting Diarrhea or bloody diarrhea Headache Flushing red face and red eyes Stomach pain Cervical lymphadenopathy Acute GI bleeding Abdominal pain Fainting Swelling of the stomach and abdomen (CDC, 2020a, b, c ) Injection Anthrax Recently, another type of anthrax infection has been identified in heroin -injecting drug users in northern Europe. This type of infection has never been reported in the United States. Symptoms may be similar to those of cutaneous anthra x, but there may be infection deep under the skin or in the muscle where the drug was injected. Injection anthrax can spread throughout the body quickly and be hard to recognize and treat. Many common bacteria can cause skin and injection site infections, so a skin or injection site infection caused by anthrax is often undiagnosed (CDC, 2020a,b,c). Injection anthrax symptoms can include: Fever and chills A group of small blisters or bumps that may itch, appearing where the drug was injected A painless skin sore with a black center that appears after the blisters or bumps Swelling around the sore Abscesses deep under the skin or in the muscle where the drug was injected (CDC, 2020 a,b,c) Diagnosis and Testing Quick diagnosis of anthrax depends as always on the timeliness of presenting symptoms by a person who can identify the possibility of exposure. As always, a thorough medical history may reveal the potential etiology (e.g., farmers and ranchers who work with animals or pesticides , putting them at higher risk for anthrax spores (CDC, 2020 a,b,c) . Treatment There is an anthrax vaccine available that can prevent people from developing symptoms should they be exposed to the bacteria (CDC, 2020b). Pre -exposure vaccination is recommended for ages 1 8 to 65 who may be at risk for occupational exposure or travelers such as military personnel. Contraindications for the vaccine , as with many vaccines, is prior exposure to the disease, impaired immune response, latex allergy , or moderate to severe co- morbidity or acute illness. The good news is that there is readily accessible treatment for anthrax, and it is treatable with common antibiotics with good survival rate. Post- exposure treatment for emergency use is doxycycline 100 mg bid, or ciprofloxacin 500 mg bid for 60 days. The FDA has issued permission for emergency dispensing of oral doxycycline without a prescription during an anthrax emergency (CDC, 2020d). Contraindications , of course , are allergic reactions to either of these medic ations . Side effects may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, sun sensitivity , and headaches. Alternatives to recommended antibiotics for those with allergic reactions are levofloxacin or amoxicillin. Treatments for 2014) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVD 5QtVmC8s Prevention strategies include: Vaccine Prophylactic antibiotics Standard precautions Early identification For early notification to the State of Nevada use the State of Nevada Confidential and Morbidity Form within 24 hours . Fax the form to the local health department . Botulism Botulism is a neuroparalytic illness characterized by symmetric, descending flaccid paralysis of motor and autonomic nerves, always begin ning with the cranial nerves. Signs and symptoms in an adult may include: Diplopia (double vision) Blurred vision Ptosis (drooping eyelids) Slurred speech Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) Dry mouth Muscle weakness Signs and symptoms in foodborne illness may also include: Abdominal pain Nausea Vomiting Diarrhea Signs and symptoms in an infant may include: Poor feeding Diminished suckling and crying ability Neck and peripheral weakness known as \"floppy baby\" Constipation Respiratory failure If untreated, illness might progress to cause descending paralysis of respiratory muscles, arms, and legs (CDC, 2021). Etiology and Transmission Botulism is caused by a potent neurotoxin produced from Clostridium botulinum, and rare strains of C. butyricum and C. baratii , which are anaerobic, spore -forming bacteria. Transmission differs type of botulism and includes the following: Foodborne botulism occurs when a person ingests botulinum toxin, which leads to illness within a few hours to days. Outbreaks of foodborne botulism have potential to be a public health emergency because the contaminated food may be eaten by many other people. A frequent source is home -canned foods prepared in an unsafe manner. Infant botulism occurs each year in a small number of susceptible infants who harbor C. botulinum in their intestinal tract. It occurs when an infant ingests spores of C. botulinum , which in turn colonize the intestinal tract and produce the toxin. Wound botulism is a rare disease that occurs when wounds infe cted with C. botulinum secrete the toxin. It occurs more frequently among persons who inject drugs but has also been seen in cases of traumatic injury, such as motorcycle crashes, and surgeries. Adult intestinal colonization (also called adult intestinal toxemia) is an even rarer type of botulism. It involves intestinal colonization in a person older than one year of age. In the small number of these cases, most patients had a history of gastrointestinal surgery or illness, such as inflammatory bowel diseas e, which might have predisposed them to enteric colonization. No other specific risk factors have been identified. Iatrogenic botulism occurs after an overdose of injected botulinum toxin for cosmetic or medical purposes (CDC, 2021). Diagnosis and Testing Botulism differs from other flaccid paralyses in that it always manifests initially with prominent cranial nerve palsies. It also differs in its descending progression, in its symmetry, and in its absence of sensory nerve dysfunction. Botulism is frequentl y misdiagnosed, most often as a polyradiculoneuropathy such as Guillain -Barr\u00e9 or Miller- Fisher syndrome, myasthenia gravis, or other diseases of the central nervous system. Clinical diagnosis of botulism is confirmed by specialized laboratory testing that often requires days to complete. Routine laboratory test results are usually unremarkable (CDC, 2021). Initial diagnosis is based on clinical symptoms. Do not wait for laboratory confirmation to begin treatment. Laboratory confirmation is done by demonstrating the presence of botulinum toxin in serum, stool, or food, or by culturing C. botulinum, C. butyricum, or C. baratii from stool, a wound, or food. Other tests and laboratory studies to help with clinical diagnosis include: Routine lab tests (CBC, electrolytes, LFTs, urinalysis): generally, not helpful in diagnosis as these tests show no characteristic abnormalities Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies: essentially normal, although occasionally a borderline elevation in protein level may be seen Tensilon test : A normal test helps to differentiate botulism from myasthenia gravis; borderline positive tests can occur in botulism. CTs and MRIs : Normal CTs and MRIs help to rule out cerebrovascular accident (CVA). (CDC, 2021) Treatment Administer botulinum antitoxin or BabyBIG as soon as possible. Antitoxin does not reverse paralysis but arrests its progression. Recovery follows the regeneration of new neuromuscular connections. Exercise meticulous intensive care, including monitoring of respiratory fun ction and, when required, mechanical ventilation. In more severe cases, ventilator support may be required for weeks to months. Treatment for wound botulism may also include wound debridement to remove the source of toxin producing bacteria and antibiotic therapy (CDC, 2021). Medical personnel caring for patients with suspected botulism should use standard precautions. Botulism is not transmitted person -to-person. Patients with botulism do not need to be isolated (CDC, 202 1). Incidence In 2015 there were 199 cases of laboratory -confirmed botulism reported to the CDC. Of these, 39 were foodborne, 141 were infant botulism, 15 were cases of wound botulism, and 4 cases were of unknown etiology (CDC, 2021). Sequelae Death can re sult from respiratory failure or the consequences of extended paralysis. About 5% of patients die. Recovery takes weeks to months. Those who survive may have fatigue and shortness of breath for years (CDC, 2021). Botulism Case Consultation If you suspect your patient may have botulism, call your state public health department immediately. If there is no answer, contact CDC 24/7 at 770 -488-7100. For non -infant cases: State public health officials can reach the CDC clinical emergency botulism service for con sultation and antitoxin. If administered early in the course of illness, antitoxin can prevent progression of illness and shorten its duration. For infant botulism: The Infant Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program, known as BabyBIG, call the Department of Public Health provides consultation 24/7 and can be reached at 510 -231-7600. If clinical consultation with state public health departments and CDC supports botulism care, request antitoxin immediately and begin treatment as soon as it is available. Do not wait for laboratory confirmation. Source: CDC, 2021. Plague (Yersinia pestis) Etiology and Transmission Plague is a lung or skin disease caused by Yersinia pestis (Y. pestis), a bacterium found in rodents and their fleas in many areas around the world. It may be transmitted by inhaling infectious droplets or transmitted through the bite of an infected flea or a break in the skin that creates inflamed lymph nodes known as buboes (CDC, 2020e). If bubonic plague is untreated, bubonic plague bacteria invade the bloodstream and spread rapidly, causing septicemic plague , and if the lungs are infected, secondary pneumonic plague . Septicemic and pneumonic plague may also be primary manifestations. A person with pneumonic plague may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If pneumonic plague develops and patients are not given specific antibiotic therapy, the disease can progress rapidl y to death. Although the majority of patients with plague present with buboes, some may have nonspecific symptoms. For example, septicemic plague can present with prominent gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Rare forms of plague include pharyngeal, meningeal, and cutaneous plague . Diagnosis and Testing Bubonic plague is the most common primary manifestation, with a buboe (inflamed lymph node) usually occurring in the groin, axilla, or cervical nodes. Buboes ar e often so painful that patients are generally guarded and have restricted movement in the affected region. The incubation period for bubonic plague is usually 2 to 6 days. Appropriate diagnostic samples include blood cultures, lymph node aspirates if possible, and/or sputum, if indicated. Chest x-rays may reveal severe infiltration. Drug therapy should begin as soon as possible after the laboratory specimens are taken. If plague is suspected, local and state health departments should be notified immediately. If patients have respiratory signs, they should also be isolated and placed on droplet precautions (CDC, 2020e). Symptoms Pneumonic plague can be transmitted from person to person, however bubonic plague cannot. Pneumonic plague affects the lungs and i s transmitted when a person breathes in the agent Y. pestis particles. Bubonic plague is transmitted through the bite of an infected flea or exposure to infected material through a break in the skin (CDC, 2020e). Plague symptoms depend on how the patient was exposed to the plague bacteri um. It can appear as common flu- like symptoms ; however , without immediate attention the person may present with cyanosis. Bubonic : Sudden onset of fever, headache, chills, and weakness and one or more swollen, tender, and p ainful lymph nodes (called buboes). This usually results from the bite of an infected flea. It is not suitable for a biological weapon. Septicemic : Fever, chills, extreme weakness, abdominal pain, shock, and possibly bleeding into the skin and other organs . This usually results from bites of infected fleas or from handling an infected animal. This was the type of plaque known in Europe as the black death. Pneumonic : Fever, headache, weakness, and a rapidly developing pneumonia with shortness of breath, chest pain, cough, and sometimes bloody or watery mucous. Nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain may also occur. It is considered suitable as a biological weapon. May develop from inhaling infectious droplets or from untreated bubonic or septicemic plague that spreads to the lungs (CDC, 2020e). Pneumonic Plague as Bioweapon Yersinia pestis used in an aerosol attack could cause the pneumonic form of plague. One to six days after becoming infected with the bacteria, individuals develop pneumonic plague. Once people have the disease, the bacteria can spread to others who have close contact with them. Because of the delay between being exposed to the bacteria and its symptoms, people could travel over a large area before becoming contagious and possibly infecting others. Controlling the disease is then more difficult. A bioweapon carrying Y. pestis is possible because the bacterium occurs in nature and could be isolated and grown in quantity in a laboratory. Even so, manufacturing an effective weapon using Y. pestis would require advanced knowledge and technology (CDC, 2020e). National and state public health officials have large supplies of drugs needed in the event of a bioterrorism attack. These supplies can be sent anywhere in the United States within 12 hours (CDC, 2020e). Treatment Treatment includes antibiotics within the first 24 hours, support care, and intensive care for pneumonic plague victims with ventilator and respiratory therapy. Antibiotics that are effective include streptomycin, gentamycin , levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin and chloramphenicol. If plague is suspected, notification of the State of Nevada Public Health Department is done with the same form mentioned earlier. Prevention Strategies As with other potential biologic age nts, prevention strategies include careful use of standard precautions and droplet precautions. An N -95 mask is not required due to the size of the microbe. Smallpox (Variola) Thousands of years ago, variola virus (smallpox virus) emerged and began cau sing illness and deaths in human populations, with smallpox outbreaks occurring from time to time. Thanks to the success of vaccination, the last natural outbreak of smallpox in the United States occurred in 1949. In 1980 the World Health Assembly declared smallpox eradicated (eliminated), and no cases of naturally occurring smallpox have happened since. Before smallpox was eradicated, it was a serious contagious disease caused by the variola virus. Because it is infectious it can easily be spread between people. Etiology and Transmission Smallpox research in the United States continues and focuses on the development of vaccines, drugs, and diagnostic tests to protect people against smallpox in the event that it is used as an agent of bioterrorism (CDC, 20 01, latest). People who had smallpo x had a fever and a distinctive, progressive skin rash of small, firm, round and deep -seated vesicles or pustules all in the same stage of development. It has an acute onset of illness with a fever > 101 F. The prodromal period is characterized by a fever, headache, chills, nausea and vomiting 1 -4 days before the rash begins. A difference between smallpox is that the rash of smallpox generally begins on the face and extremities and the crop of vesicles all begin at the same time, unless the vesicles of chic ken pox that are in various stages and tend to begin and cluster on the trunk. Most people with smallpox recovered, but about 3 out of every 10 people with the disease died. Many smallpox survivors have permanent scars over large areas of their body, especially their faces. Some are left blind (CDC, 2001, latest ). It is mainly spread by direct and fairly prolonged face -to-face contact between people via airborne transmission. Smallpox patients became contagious once the first sores appeared in their mouth and throat, which is the early rash stage. They spread the virus when they coughed or sneezed and droplets from their nose or mouth spread to other people. They remained contagious until their last smallpox scab fell off. Because smallpox was declared to b e eradicated in 1980 public vaccination is no longer practiced, which makes an outbreak possibly more expansive. These scabs and the fluid found in the patient's sores also contained the variola virus. The virus can spread through these materials or through the objects contaminated by them, such as bedding or clothing. People who cared for smallpox patients and washed their bedding or clothing had to wear gloves and take care to avoid transmission by direct contact of body fluids. Rarely, smallpox has spr ead through the airborne route in enclosed settings, such as a building or a situation with poor ventilation, but it requires face to face contact with an infected person. Smallpox can be spread by humans only. Scientists have no evidence that smallpox can be spread by insects or animals (CDC, 2017b). A person with smallpox goes through several stages as the disease progresses. Each stage has its own signs and symptoms : Incubation Initial symptoms Early rash Pustular rash and scabs Scabs fall off No scabs (CDC, 20 01, latest) There is no proven treatment for smallpox disease, but some antiviral drugs may help treat it or prevent it from getting worse. There currently is a vaccine to protect people from smallpox but it is not commonly given in the United States. If there were a smallpox outbreak, health officials would use the smallpox vaccine to control it (CDC, 2001, latest ). Distribution of Pox Rash Comparison of Smallpox vs Chickenpox Smallpox Chicken pox Prodrome Severe flu -like symptoms Mild flu-like symptoms Rash Synchronous vesicles in the same stage Crops in a variety of stages of vesicles Location Begins on face and extremities Begins on trunk Source : Tracey Long, 2021. Diagnosis and Treatment Treatment includes supportive measures such as Tylenol, IV fluids , and comfort measures for the skin such as an antipruritic for intense itching. Vaccinations may be given up to 3 to 4 days post exposure. Most likely, if smallpox is released into the United States as a bioterrorist attack, public health authorities will learn of it when the first afflicted person goes to a hospital for treatment of an unknown illness. Physicians will examine the person using tools developed by CDC to decide if signs and symptoms are similar to those of smallpox. Patients with smallpox do need to be isolated. Even if clinicians suspect the person has smallpox, they will isolate and care for the person in the hospital so that others do not come in contact with the smallpox virus. The hospital must contact local public health authorities that they have a patient who might have smallpox. Local public health authorities would then alert public health officials at the state and federal level to help diagnose the disease. If experts confirm the illness is smallpox, then CDC, along with state and local public health authorities, will put into place their plans to respond to a bioterrorist attack with smallpox . Best Practices for First Receivers [Material in this and following sections is from OSHA, 2005 (latest) unless otherwise cited.] Healthcare workers risk occupational exposures to biologic materials when a hospital receives contaminated patients, particularly during mass casualty events. Hospital employees termed first receivers are those who work at a site away fro m where the hazardous release occurred. This means that their exposures are limited to the substances transported to the hospital on the skin, hair, clothing, or personal belongings of the victim. The location and limited source of contaminants distinguish es first receivers from first responders such as firefighters, law enforcement, and ambulance service personnel, who typically respond to the site of the incident and may also be exposed. The current recommendations for best practices for hospital -based fi rst receivers is still the guideline established by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration in 2005. Worst -case scenarios take into account challenges associated with communication, resources, and multiple victims. During mass -casualty emergen cies, hospitals can anticipate little or no warning before victims begin arriving. First receivers can anticipate that information regarding the hazardous agents may not be immediately available. Hospitals can also anticipate a large number of self -referre d victims (as many as 80% of the total number of victims) and should assume victims will not have been decontaminated prior to arriving at the hospital . An employee's role at a facility and the corresponding hazards the employee might encounter dictate the level of training that must be provided to any first receiver. Selection of personal protective equipment (PPE) must be based on a hazard assessment that carefully considers these factors, along with the steps taken to minimize the extent of the employee 's contact with hazardous substances. Surge capacity, triage, decontamination, security, and disposal of contaminated wastewater must also be addressed. Surge Capacity In the event of a mass casualty event, healthcare organizations must be able to increase their services quickly in response to the crisis. This is an organization's surge capacity , which is \"the ability to expand care capabilities in response to sudden or prolonged demand\" (NIH, 2017). Staffing levels, education and training, decontamination capabilities, vaccination programs for direct caregivers, volunteer resources , and stockpiling of supplies must be assessed while, in most cases, routine care continues. Individual personnel on an emergency response team have slightly diffe ring concerns and responsibilities when it comes to surge situations. While surge capacity planning is an administrative level concern, individual healthcare providers should understand the basic concept and the need for guidelines in order to participate effectively in training and any necessary implementation. The CDC's handbook, Updated in a Moment's Notice: Surge Capacity in Terrorist Bombings (2010, latest) is still the standard guideline on surge capacity. The ability of the organization to \"degrade gracefully\" must also be considered. The term graceful degradation is the ability of a machine or in this context, a medical system, to maintain limited function even when a large portion has become inoperable (Wiki, 2021). A healthcare organization should have a plan to deal with a reduction in services as the number of patients increases. The goal is to engineer and manage failures and thus to avoid \"catastrophic failure\" During a state of emergency, it may be impossible to follow normal practice guidelin es. The Joint Commission recommends that hospitals and oversight agencies \"provide for waiver of regulatory requirements under conditions of extreme emergency. A recent example of this was the severe limitation of PPE resources for nurses and hospital staff when dealing with the large influx of patients in the United States due to COVID -19. Normal recommendations for not reusing PPEs were relaxed as nurses wore the same PPEs for an entire shift due to diminished supplies. The Joint Commission, previously ca lled JCHOA) had to relax standards during the crisis (Joint Commission, 2020). Triage Pre-decontamination triage serves three purposes: Distinguishes contaminated individuals from other patients arriving at the hospital by identifying symptoms and victim's proximity to a known chemical release Identifies patients who require immediate stabilization before they enter the decontamination system Identifies injuries or critical pre -hospital treatment materials that will require special handling inside the decontamination system Post-decontamination triage for medical treatment should occur in the hospital post- decontamination zone after victims are inspected and found to be free of contamination. Some hospitals combine decontamination and initial medical treatment (such as antidotes), which means either the healthcare worker attempts medical triage while wearing PPE (preferred) or the worker is at risk of exposure from victims who have not been adequately decontaminated . Decontamination Activities Hospitals m ust identify spaces that will support decontamination activities (including equipment storage) and ensure that operations can continue in the event that one area of the hospital becomes contaminated. Hospitals planning additions or remodeling projects have a unique opportunity to design spaces appropriately. Other hospitals should use creative planning to identify existing architectural features that they can use to their advantage. Victims who cannot ambulate can require a substantial proportion of first r eceivers' time and efforts, and first receivers are likely to experience the greatest exposure while assisting these victims . If decontamination is necessary, numerous agencies and organizations recommend a shower time of approximately five minutes for contaminated victims brought into a hospital. Despite the fact that there is no empirical data, operational procedures deem this time to be adequate. Numerous agencies and programs recommend the use of water and a liquid soap with good surfactant properties (such as hand dishwashing detergent) to decontaminate victims during emergencies and for mass casualties involving hazardous substances . Isolation and Lockdown Hospitals can use a variety of methods to limit unauthorized access to the emergency departmen t until the victims have been decontaminated. The methods range from a guard at the locked door to sophisticated keycard systems controlled at a central command center. These more complex systems tend to be associated with urban or recently modernized hosp itals and are intended for use in any type of disturbance. Hospitals can use these methods if situations suggest that an unruly crowd will force its way into the hospital. Security Site security helps maintain order and control traffic around the decontamination facility and the hospital entrances. Security officers might need to control a contaminated individual to prevent other staff from becoming exposed and to protect equipment. Security officers also ensure contaminated victims do not bypass the decont amination hospital or enter the ED without passing inspection. In cases of civil disturbance, properly identified security officers can protect the decontamination facility and staff so normal operations can continue. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Hospitals should select personal protective equipment (PPE) such as respirators, suits, gloves, and face and eye protection based on a hazard assessment that identifies the hazards to which employees might be exposed. Under OSHA's Personal Protective Equipme nt Standard, or the parallel State Plan standards, all employers, including hospitals, must certify in writing that the hazard assessment has been performed. First -receiver hospitals may base the hazard assessment on OSHA's Best Practices document. Hospita ls likely to respond to incidents involving a specific hazard should adjust the PPE accordingl y. OSHA's Personal Protective Equipment Standard also requires that employees be provided with equipment that fits appropriately. Some hospitals assign a set of protective equipment to a specific individual, and that equipment is stored in a container marked with the individual's name. Other hospitals maintain general supplies of PPE, storing sets of equipment by size. In this case, the packages are clearly marked only with the size. Each first receiver tries on equipment in advance to determine what size group fits best so that, during an emergency, the employee can quickly locate appropriate PPE. An example is that hospitals complete a fit test for N-95 masks for all staff at least annually , so staff know what size is best for them before the need arrives. Personal protective equipment selection for first receivers has been a topic of extensive discussion, especially after the PPE supply depletions during the COVID -19 crisis. At the root of this discussion is the need for hospitals to provide adequate protection for the anticipated worst -case scenario, despite having limited information regarding the nature of the substance with which victims may be contaminated. Th is lack of information challenges hospitals' abilities to conduct the hazard assessments on which PPE selection must be based . Infection Control Heightened awareness, education , and preparedness by infection control (IC) professionals facilitates earlier recognition of symptoms caused by a biological agent. Infection control professionals are involved with many aspects of hospital operations and often with their counterparts in other hospitals. As a result, they may recognize changing patterns or clusters in a hospital or in a community that might otherwise go unrecognized , Infection control professionals should ensure that hospitals have current telephone numbers for notificati on of both internal and external support and that they are distributed to the appropriate personnel. They should work with clinical microbiology laboratories, on - or off -site, that receive specimens for testing from their facility to ensure that cultures f rom suspicious cases are evaluated as quickly as possible . Wastewater Management Wastewater from decontamination showers can contain low -level concentrations of the substance(s) with which victims are contaminated. Given the opportunity to plan for deconta mination activities (by designing and installing or purchasing decontamination facilities, developing procedures, and preparing staff), hospitals should consider the management of decontamination shower water as part of their emergency preparedness plan . Decontaminating Surfaces and Equipment The hospital emergency management plan should include procedures for cleaning equipment and surfaces during and after an incident. Cleaning should be performed by employees who are properly protected and trained. Items that cannot be decontaminated safely should be processed for appropriate disposal. It is unlikely that portable gear could be adequately decontaminated after an incident involving a persistent or highly toxic agent. Reporting an Incident of Bioterrorism In the event of an incident of bioterrorism in your community, you should know what to report and to whom the report should be sent. First reporters should start at the healthcare organization or hospital level by reporting to the department supervisor, laboratory, and infection control department. Next contact the local health/regional departments, which will contact the Nevada State Health Division and the CDC. Successful reporting of a bioterrorism event results from good planning, education, and awarenes s, as well as regular quality process review and improvement before an occurrence. In most cases telephone will still be the primary means for immediate reporting because it is direct, rapid, and easy -to-use. There should always be a backup communication plan such as cell phones or radio in case of a telephone system failure. In every institution a clear process should be established to ensure a reliable and immediate response to notifiable diseases and health conditions.

Radiological and Nuclear Weapons Radiation is any form of energy propagated as rays, waves, or energetic particles that travel (radiate) from their source. Radiation can travel through the air or through a material medium (Williams, 2020). There are five p rimary types of radiation: Alpha particles Beta particles Gamma rays X-rays Neutrons Radiation types vary in their size, charge, ability to travel, and ability to penetrate objects. These variations affect their uses, their current and future effects, wha t materials effectively shield against them, the parts of the body they can potentially damage, and the exposure restrictions mandated by the government (CDC 2020 f,g; ORISE, 2017 ). Radioactive materials are composed of atoms that are unstable. An unstable atom gives off its excess energy until it becomes stable. The energy emitted is radiation. The process by which an atom changes from an unstable state to a more stable state by emitting radiation is called radioactive decay or radioactivity (NTI, 2015d). Radiation is often divided into ionizing and non -ionizing radiation. Radiation that has enough energy to move atoms in a molecule or cause them to vibrate, but not enough to change them chemically, is referred to as non -ionizing radiation. Examples of this kind of radiation are radio waves and visible light (Williams, 2020). Radiation that falls within the ionizing radiation range (alpha and beta particles and gamma rays) has enough energy to break the bonds that tie electrons into the atoms or molecules that make up ordinary substances. This is the type that people usually think of as \"radiation\" when dealing with nuclear dangers. Ironically, this is also the type of radiation that is used for medical treatment and in many manufacturing processe s (Williams, 2020; ORISE, 201 7). Compared with other types of radiation that may be absorbed, ionizing radiation deposits a large amount of energy into a small area. All ionizing radiation is capable, directly or indirectly, of removing electrons from most molecules. This property of ionizing radiation lies at the root of both its usefulness and its dangers (Williams, 2020). Radiation cannot be detected by the human senses . A radiologic survey conducted with specialized equipment is the only way to confirm the presence of radiation. If a terrorist event involves the use of radioactive material, both patient exposure and contamination must be assessed. Exposure occurs when a person is near a radiation source. People exposed to a source of radiation can suffer radiation illness if the dose is high enough, but they do not become radioactive themselves. For example, an x -ray machine is a source of radiation exposure, yet a person does not become radioactive or pose a risk to others following a chest x -ray (Kotora , 2015). When nuclear medicine is used however, a patient may be considered to emit some radiation upon others and must be careful to not share eating utensils or even the same bathroom for a period of time. Measuring Radiation When scientists measure radiation, they use different terms depending on whether they are discussing radiation coming from a radioactive source, the radiation dose absorbed by a person, or the risk that a person will suffer health effects (biological risk) from exposure. Most scie ntists in the international community measure radiation using the Syst\u00e8me International d'Unit\u00e9s (SI), a uniform system of weights and measures that evolved from the metric system. In the United States, however, the conventional system of measurement and n ot metric is still widely used. Different units of measurements are chosen depending on what aspect of radiation is being measured. For example, the amount of radiation being given off, or emitted, by a radioactive material is measured using the conventional unit curie (Ci), named for the famed scientist Marie Curie, or the SI unit becquerel (Bq). The radiation dose absorbed by a person is the amount of energy deposited in human tissue by radiation and is measured using the conventional unit rad or the SI unit gray (Gy). The biologic risk of exposure to radiation is the risk that a person will suffer health effects from an exposure to radiation and is measured using the conventional unit rem or the SI unit sievert (Sv) (NTI, 2021; Williams, 2020). Types of Radiation Injury The only non- test deployment of nuclear weapons was the 1945 dropping of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, near the end of World War II. Those at the center of impact were killed immediately by thermal and shock forces as well as intense radiation poisoning. Others at varying distances from the bomb's center were injured and died later. Still others are alive today, but many of them have suffered from the latent effects of radiation exposure. Because of the huge populations that were affected, we now have identified patterns of aftereffects, which are the patterns of radiation illness and injury that follow closely upon exposure. Understanding these patterns will aid in diagnosis and treatment of radiation -induced injury or illness. Radioactive contamination and radiation exposure could occur if radioactive materials are released into the environment as the result of an accident, an event in nature, or an act of terrorism. Such a release could expose people and contaminate th eir surroundings and personal property (Williams, 2020). Exposure Radiation exposure occurs when all or part of the body absorbs penetrating ionizing radiation from an external radiation source. Exposure from an external source stops when a person leaves the area of the source, the source is shielded completely, or the process causing exposure ceases. During exposure, the body may absorb radiation, or it may pass completely through the body. This is similar to what happens during an ordinary chest x -ray. An individual who has been exposed in this way is not radioactive and can be treated like any other patient (ORISE, 201 7; REMM, 2017). An individual exposed only to an external source of radiation, is NOT radioactive or contaminated and may be approached without risk, just as is the case following a chest x -ray or CT scan (REMM, 201 7). Radiation exposure also occurs after internal contamination, when a radioactive material is ingested, inhaled, or absorbed into the bloodstream. This kind of exposure stops onl y if the radionuclide is eliminated from the body, with or without treatment (REMM, 2017). Radiation from external exposure alone is either absorbed without the body becoming radioactive, or it can pass through the body completely. Therefore, if a person is scanned with a radiation survey monitor after external exposure alone, the device will not register radiation above the background level (REMM, 2017). Contamination: External or Internal Contamination results when a radioisotope (as gas, liquid, or solid) is released into the environment and then ingested, inhaled, or deposited on the body surface. External contamination results when radioactive material is deposited on skin, hair, eyes, or other external structures, much like mud or dust. External contam ination stops when the material is removed by shedding contaminated clothes and/or completely washing off the contamination (REMM, 201 7). Internal contamination results when radioactive material is taken into the body via inhalation or ingestion or open wo unds. Internal deposition of radioisotopes in organs results in local exposure at that location. Internal contamination continues until the radioactive material decays, is flushed from the body by natural processes, or is removed by medical countermeasures (REMM, 2017 ). Incorporation After inhalation, ingestion, or wound contamination, small radioisotope particles may be transported via blood or lymphatics into cells, tissues, and organs. Isotopes can be alpha -, beta -, or gamma -emitting. Radioisotopes can be incorporated into one or more organs specific for that isotope, (e .g., thyroid, lungs, kidneys, bones/bone marrow, or liver/spleen) resulting in exposure at that site. Medical countermeasures called decorporation agents or other procedures such as diuresis may be needed to remove radioisotopes that have been incorporated into tissues. Patients who have received radioactive substances for diagnostic procedures should be taught to drink 1 t 2 liters of water after the procedure to help eliminate the radioisotope. Toxic effects of radioisotopes may be due to their chemical and/or radiologic properties (REMM, 201 7). Radiation- Induced Illness Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS) Acute radiation syndrome (ARS) \u2014sometimes known as radiation toxicity or radiation sickness\u2014is an acute illness caused by irradiation of the entire body, or most of the body, by a high dose of penetrating radiation in a very short period of time (usually a matter of minutes) (CDC, 2018d). The most probable terrorist events, such as a dirty bomb attack, will likely generate low levels of radiation exposure. If ARS cases are seen, it is likely that casualty numbers will be small (CDC, 2018d). Basic issues of ARS that may modify how symptoms present include: Time of exposure, distance from radioactive source, and duration of exposure. Patients may present individually if exposed to radioactive sources that are hidden in the community. Symptoms can be immediate or delayed, mild or severe, base d on radiation dose. Nausea and vomiting may occur minutes to days after exposure. Early onset of vomiting followed by symptoms of bone marrow suppression, gastrointestinal destruction, and/or cardiovascular/CNS effects are indicative of acute illness. Depending on the stage of illness, a patient may be asymptomatic. (CDC, 2018d) The required conditions for ARS are: The radiation dose must be large (> 0.7 Gy, or >70 rads). The dose usually must be external . The radiation must be penetrating (able to reach the internal organs). The entire body (or a significant portion of it) must have received the dose. The dose must have been delivered in a short time (usually a matter of minutes). (CDC, 2018d) The three classic ARS syndromes are: Bone marrow syndrome (hem atopoietic syndrome) Gastrointestinal syndrome Cardiovascular (CV)/ central nervous system (CNS) syndrome (CDC, 2018d) The four stages of ARS are: Prodromal stage (N -V-D stage): Classic symptoms are nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Anorexia generally follo ws depending on dose of exposure. The symptoms may begin from minutes to days following exposure and last episodically from minutes to several days. Latent stage : The patient looks and feels generally healthy, for a few hours to a few weeks. Manifest illne ss stage : The symptoms depend on the specific syndrome and last from hours to several months. Recovery or death : Most patients who do not recover will die within several months of exposure. The recovery process lasts from several weeks to 2 years (CDC, 2018d). Cutaneous Radiation Syndrome (CRS) The concept of cutaneous radiation syndrome (CRS) was introduced in recent years to describe the complex pathologic syndrome that results from acute radiation exposure to the skin. ARS is usually accompanied by some skin damage. It is possible to receive a damaging dose to the skin without symptoms of ARS, especially with acute exposures to beta radiation or x-rays. Sometimes this occurs when radioactive materials contaminate a patient's skin or clothes. When the basal cell layer of the skin is damaged by radiation, inflammation, erythema, and dry or moist desquamation can occur. Also, hair follicles may be damaged, causing epilation. Within a few hours after irradiation, a transient and inconsistent erythema (associated with itching) can occur. Then, a latent phase may occur and last from a few days up to several weeks, when intense reddening, blistering, and ulceration of the irradiated site are visible. In most cases, healing occurs by regenerative means; ho wever, very large skin doses can cause permanent hair loss, damaged sebaceous and sweat glands, atrophy, fibrosis, decreased or increased skin pigmentation, and ulceration or necrosis of the exposed tissue (CDC, 2018d). Nuclear Agents The concern about nu clear agents is similar to radiation exposure and is addressed with the same protocols. The difference is the agent, which is a nuclear radiation. Although nuclear weapons have been the fodder for many Hollywood movies as having potential to cause the grea test impact of public health, it is less common because it requires advanced knowledge and technology. The great concern, however, is if the nuclear weapons contain biological agents that could be disseminated to huge, populated areas , killing thousands o f humans as well as livestock ( SNHD , 2020). A Kg of viable anthrax could kill as many as Hiroshima size weapon. Although anthrax can be treated with cipro and doxycycline, prophylactic medications have a limited shelf life and limitations in supplies is real. Stockpiling these medications is impossible. Protecting Staff and Patients The CDC has established general guidelines for managing patients and protecting staff in the event of radiation exposure. These guidelines are specifically designed for small- scale incidents not resulting from a large or nuclear device. An example of a common protection is having staff who work in the radiology department wear tags that indicate daily and weekly radiation exposure. If they exceed the limit, they ar e pulled from working directly with the radiation machines to prevent additional radiation exposure until their total exposure decreases to acceptable levels. The department most regulated in any hospital is the radiology department. Hospitals and other agencies are expected to have mass casualty strategies in place, and all appropriate staff should be trained in proper procedures and use of equipment. OSHA provides m any resources for establishing triage areas and managing mass casualties (OSHA, 2005 , latest). According to the CDC, addressing contamination issues should not delay treatment of life-threatening injuries. It is highly unlikely that the levels of radioactivity associated with a contaminated patient would pose a significant health risk to care providers. In certain rare instances, the presence of imbedded radioactive fragments or large amounts of external contamination may require expedited decontamination ; thus, it is recommended to include in -house radiation professionals on the response team (CDC, 2018c). The CDC staff protection guidelines include the following for an ad hoc triage area: Base it on your hospital's disaster plan and the anticipated number of casualties. Establish a contaminated area and a clean area separated by a buffer zone . Remove your contaminated outer garments when leaving the contaminated area. Have your body surveyed with a radiation meter when exiting a contaminated area. (CDC 2018c) Use standard precautions to protect staff: Follow standard guidelines for protection from microbiologic contamination. Surgical masks should be adequate. N-95 masks, if available, are recommended. Survey hands and clothing at frequent intervals with a radiation meter. Due to fetal sensitivity to radiation, assign pregnant staff to other d uties. (CDC, 2018c) Protective Clothing for Staff The purpose of protective clothing is to keep bare skin and personal clothing free of external contamination. Paper coveralls, cloth coveralls, and surgical garb are all appropriate protective clothing. Because most people are not used to working in extra layers of clothing, they should be monitored for heat stress . \"Standard issue particulate protective masks (respirators) afford excellent protection from inhalation and ingestion of most radioactive material\" (ORISE, 2017). Additional protective clothing includes wearing radiation -blocking lead aprons, which are commonly used in catherization labs. PPE in Radiation Emergencies In a radiation emergency, the choice of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) depends on : Response role and specific task s Risk of contamination PPE can protect against : External contamination Internal contamination via inhalation, ingestion, absorption through open wounds Other physical hazards (e.g., debris, fire/heat, chemicals) PPE cannot protect against : Exposure fro m high energy \u2014highly penetrating forms of ionizing radiation associated with most radiation emergencies o Note that lead aprons worn in diagnostic radiology do not provide sufficient shielding against these kinds of radiation. PPE Equipment: PPE should include a personal radiation dosimeter whenever there is concern about exposure to penetrating ionizing radiation. Direct -reading personal radiation dosimeters may be used to monitor radiation dose and can help workers stay within recommended Dose Limits f or Emergency Workers. Direct -reading dosimeters should be worn so that a worker can easily see the read-out and/or hear warning alarms. Recommended respiratory PPE includes a full -face piece air purifying respirator with a P -100 or High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filter. Other respiratory protective equipment (e.g., a simple surgical face mask, N - 95 respirators), non -fit tested respirators, or ad hoc respiratory protection do not deliver appropriate or sufficient respiratory protection. Environmenta l testing and hazard assessment by a safety professional can help identify hazards and risk levels and direct choices . More detailed information about forms of PPE and their efficacy is available from the Radiation Emergency Medical Management website . Decontamination Guidelines for Patients The CDC offers the following guidelines for managing patients who are believed to have been contaminated either externally or internally with radiation. Before beginning treatment, staff should be sure to take care in following their agency's guidelines for donning and doffing protective clothing or equipment. Guidelines to complete a correct survey of radiation for any patient i ncluding the following for using a radiation meter: Perform surveys using consistent technique and trained personnel. Note exceptionally large amounts of surface or embedded radioactive material. Handle radioactive objects with forceps and store in lead co ntainers. Record location and level of any contamination found. Remove patient clothing: Carefully cut clothing and roll it away from the face to contain the contamination. Double -bag clothing using radioactive hazardous waste guidelines, label, and save as evidence. Repeat patient survey and record level. (REMM 2017) Cleanse contaminated areas: Wash wounds first with saline or water. If facial contamination is present, flush eyes, nose, and ears, and rinse mouth. Gently cleanse intact skin with soap and water, starting outside the contaminated area and washing inward. Do not irritate or abrade the skin. Resurvey and note levels. Repeat washing until survey indicates radiation level is no more than twice background or the level remains unchanged. Cover woun ds with waterproof dressing. Dispose of wastewater through normal channels. For mass casualties, consider establishing separate shower areas for ambulatory and non -ambulatory patients. (REMM, 2017.) Management of deceased: If exposed to a lethal dose of ra diation without contamination, a patient is not radioactive, and no special precautions are needed. Special precautions may be necessary for contaminated deceased . (NTI, 2021) Initial Evaluation and Treatment Treat vomiting and then complete a CBC analysis, with special attention to the lymphocyte count, every 2 to 3 hours for the first 8 to 12 hours after exposure, and every 4 to 6 hours for the following 2 to 3 days. Precisely record all clinical symptoms, particularly nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and itc hing, reddening, or blistering of the skin. Be sure to include time of onset. Note and record areas of erythema. If possible, take color photographs of suspected radiation skin damage. Consider tissue and blood typing as well as initiation of viral prophylaxis. Promptly consult with radiation, hematology, and radiotherapy experts about dosimetry, prognosis, and treatment options. Call the Radiation Emergency Assistance Center to record the incident in the Radiation Accident Registry System (see numbe rs under Resources at the end of this course). After consultation, begin the following treatment (as indicated): Supportive care in a clean environment (e.g., burn unit) Prevention and treatment of infections Stimulation of hematopoiesis by use of growth f actors Stem cell transfusions or platelet transfusions (if platelet count is < 100,000) Psychological S upport Careful observation for erythema (document locations), hair loss, skin injury, mucositis, parotitis, weight loss, or fever Confirmation of initial dose estimate, using chromosome aberration cytogenetic bioassay when possible (Although resource -intensive, this is the best method of dose assessment following acute exposures.) Consultation with experts in radiation accident management. (CDC, 2018c) Government guidance for radiation management is clustered in the website of the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education . Internal Contamination Consider internal contamination if high survey readings persist following decontamination. Internal contamination generally does not cause early symptoms. Nose or mouth contamination may indicate inhalation or ingestion. To check for internal contamination: Assessment may include analysis of urine, blood, and fecal samples or whole - body counts. Consult with radiation experts. Radiation experts may recommend early administration of radionuclide - specific decorporation agents such as Prussian blue, DTPA, or bicarbonate. Gastric lavage, antacids, and in clearing ingested contaminants. (CDC, 2018c) Medical Management: Countermeasures During a radiological or nuclear emergency, radioactive materials may be released into the air and then breathed into the lung s or may get into the body through open wounds. Radioactive materials can also contaminate the local food supply and enter the body through eating or drinking. This is called internal contamination. The sooner internal contamination is removed from the body, the fewer and less severe the health effects will be. Small amounts of internal contamination may not need treatment. Some medical treatments are available for limiting or removing internal contamination , depending on the type of radioactive material involved. Medical professionals will determine if any of the following treatments are needed: Potassium Iodide 2018d) Psychosocial Issues In urban areas, hundreds to thousands may seek care. Most will self -refer to the nearest hospital. While many may need decontamination, others may seek radiologic screening even though not contaminated. Many simply seek reassurance. Mental health professionals should be members of th e response team and available in a first-receiver facility to provide such support. When evaluating patients, healthcare workers need to understand that psychogenic symptoms, such as nausea or vomiting, may manifest. Keep in mind that vomiting due to radia tion exposure is usually recurrent rather than episodic. Provide radiation exposure fact sheets for patients and families and remember that pregnant patients require special counseling. It is likely that separate areas for radiation screening and counseling will be needed for patients with minimal risk of exposure or injury . 6. Health Alert Network (HAN) The Health Alert Network (HAN) is a nationwide communications system established by the CDC and implemented by each state. The Nevada HAN provides a 24/7 means of two- way communication for all critical health information among the Nevada Division of Public and Behavioral Health and local and rural healthcare professionals. These professionals include physicians, nurses, hospitals, laboratories, clinicians, public health workers, emergency management, and others (SNHD, 2020). The Nevada Health Alert Network (NVHAN) is administered by the Division of Public and Behavioral Health (DPBH), Public Health Preparedness Program (PHP). NVHAN is a statewide, bed tracking, availability and alerting system in place throughout the state. Its digital, high -speed notification system is used to rapidly contact hospitals and healthcare facilities, and thousands of staff with extreme speed and accuracy (NVHAN, 2021) . NVHAN is co mposed of three systems: 1. HAvBED (Hospital Available Beds for Emergencies and Disasters) 2. NXT Communicator (allows rapid contact of large groups of key individuals) 3. Wireless Priority Service (WPS) and Government Emergency Telecommunications Service (GETS) (provides additional communication capabilities in an emergency when wireless or public systems are congested). Healthcare professionals interested in signing up for NVHAN should visit the Nevada Health Alert Network (NVHAN) website and follow the link to sign up . For more information , contact the administrator at 775 684 3223 . http://dpbh.nv.gov/Programs/NVHAN/NVHAN_ -_Home/ Healthcare professionals in southern Nevada can also get information and/or sign up at the Southern Nevada Health District HAN Coordi nator at 702 759 1000 or sign up at the district's website (SNHD, 2020). https://southernnevadahealthdistrict.org/epi/forms/han -enrollment Alert Message Types CDC HAN messages range from informational updates of general interest to alerts that require imm ediate action. Examples of the different types of alerts listed below ; archives of past alerts may be found on the CDC Health Alert Network website. http://emergency.cdc.gov/HAN/ Health Alert : provides vital, time -sensitive information for a specific incident or situation; warrants immediate action or attention by health officials, laboratorians, clinicians, and members of the public and conveys the highest level of importance. Health Advisory : provides important information for a specific incident or situ ation, contains recommendations or actionable items to be performed by public health officials, laboratorians, and/or clinicians that may not require immediate action. Health Update : provides updated information regarding an incident or situation unlikely to require immediate action. Info Service : provides general public health information; unlikely to require immediate action. (CDC, 2020b) 7. Summary Due to escalating occurrences of domestic and international terrorism, it is crucial for healthcare professionals to be aware and alert to presenting symptoms that may result from such violent acts. Quick identification of the cause of suspicious symptoms can help improve rapid diagnosis and treatment for better patient outcomes. Being trained and prepared on how to respond to chemical, biochemical , and radiation attacks on our own citizens is essential for successful outcomes and to minimize damage to individuals and the community. Knowing what targets, protocols, and resources are unique to Nevada has justified the requirement for Nevada nurses to take a course on bioterrorism (SNHD, 2021).
