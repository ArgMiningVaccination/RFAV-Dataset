A similar question can be posed: if medicine really works, why aren't chiropractors using it? It's not about one method working and one not. The real question is: What is each working at? And the truth is, Chiropractic and medicine are working two different models. Chiropractic works via salutogenesis. Medicine works via pathogenesis. Salutogenesis literally means \"that which gives birth to health.\" It is the complete opposite of pathogenesis, which means \"that which gives birth to disease.\" Chiropractic adheres to the salutogenic model. Medicine adheres to the pathogenic model. The pathogenic model emphasizes the treatment of symptoms and sickness. Treatment involves isolating a condition and trying to suppress its symptoms. The salutogenic model emphasizes adaptation, homeostasis and healing in the individual. Care aims to enhance function and support the healing process. While both are workable models, it doesn't make them at odds with each other. One approach is not better than the other. Thinking of them in those terms is the wrong mindset. They each bring something unique to the \"health table.\" Medicine works because the pathogenic model has merit. Chiropractic can't deny that. Chiropractic works as well because the salutogenic model has merit. Medicine can't deny this. But questions still arise: why two different models? If they both work, why not use both as a chiropractor or a medical doctor? Generally speaking, medicine is too enamored with the pathogenic model to concern itself with other models. Medicine has been using the pathogenic model for thousands of years. It is the foundational perspective for conventional medicine. For example, when you are sick, medicine talks about the pathology of disease X, Y or Z. Or that a pathogen caused a disease. There are specialists within medicine, called Pathologists, who study the process of disease. Medicine is also known as allopathy. For this reason, treating symptoms and sickness is very much ingrained in our healthcare system. This \"disease monopoly\" has even permeated the majority of alternative medical practices. Osteopathy, homeopathy, naturopathy, etc. have all incorporated disease in their name. There is a downside though to this one-sided way of thinking when it comes to health. A disease-focused system will never be healthy. This is where Chiropractic steps in. Chiropractic chooses to focus on health, not disease. Chiropractic is not called \"chiropathy\" for a reason. Chiropractic care improves functions of the body, specifically homeostasis and adaptability. This in turn assists the body in the healing process, no matter what disease is present. The potential for health is improved. In my opinion, it would be asking too much of medicine to incorporate salutogenic principles into its model. The same can be said about Chiropractic in trying to add pathogenic principles to its model. Chiropractic and medicine can work together in their proper ratios to improve what needs to work most of all, health.
