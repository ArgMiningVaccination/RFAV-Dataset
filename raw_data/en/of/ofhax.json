Applied research often takes the results of basic research investments and carries them forward to determine the operational parameters of potential technologies and evaluate the practicality of applying those technologies to military needs. The assessment of the Applied Research program found that: x The program purpose and design are clear. The Department has built methodical processes for setting program goals and for reviewing progress. The program is designed to ensure that warfighters have superior and affordable technology to support their missions and to provide revolutionary war-winning capabilities. x Reviews of the program by external review panels are not independent of program officials. x A large part of the program is executed either without the benefit of military or scientific expertise in choosing the funded work or without allowing the applications process to be open to all capable researchers. Earmarking of projects in the program has increased in the recent past and has led to these problems. In response to these findings, the Administration will: 1. Continue to ensure that adequate funding exists to carry promising basic research results into the realm of applied research. 2. Change the expert evaluation process to use fully independent review panels in assessing the performance of the program. 3. Work with the research community and Congress to explain the need to limit claims on research grant funds to proposals that independently can meet the standards of a strict merit-review process.

Models of complex gene-protein interactions will enable simulation, dynamic analysis, prediction a nd control of cellular processes. Based on these models, the program is developing B io-SPICE (Simulation Program for Intra-Cell Evaluation), an open software framework providing innovative models and analysis tools. The extensible design of Bio-SPICE allows for adding, refining and customizing of the Bio-SPICE models and tools for specific cell processes. (U) Technical challenges to developing Bio-SPICE are met in several wa ys. First, four-dimensional (4-D) computational models are b eing developed to capture spatio-temporal inter actions of gene-proteins in cellular mechan isms. This includes hybrid analog-discret e models of biochemical reactions, small concentration reactants, asynchronous and stochastic com putation, and reaction-diffusion spatial m odels. Second, cognitive information processing tools will be exploited to rapidly extract and incorpor ate molecular interaction information f rom structured and unstructured databases and scientific publications in the private and public domain. Third, new 4-D simulation techniques are being developed that can scale to large numbers of gene-protein interactions. To transition the technology, th e program is collaborating with several DoD client agencies including Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), U.S. Army Medical Research and Material Command (USAMRMC), Soldier Biological and Chemical Command (SBCCOM), Walter-Reed Army Ins titute for Research (WRAIR), Naval Medical Research Command (NMRC), the U. S. Air Force Toxicology program, and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). (U) Program Plans: Develop a progressively sophisticated suite of dynamic cellular models and architecture for Bio-SPICE, which will enable modeli ng, prediction, and control of cellular processes. Con tinually validate results through experimentation. Continue to incorporate spatial models into Bio-SPICE and e xplore potential reduced-order models to analyze the non-linear and stochastic dynamics of thousands of interactions.

(U) The Computer Exploitation and Human Collaboration program is also exploring the fundamental science of interconnected systems t o provide powerful mathematical tools for understanding the intrinsi c properties and complexities of large-scale networks and oth er distributed systems. This foundational research is imperative for future desi gn of robust systems that break out of the established tradit ion of piece-wise patching current infrastructures. The resulting mathematical t ools will allow development and defense of critical infrastructu res; and create more efficient, reliable data networks for the warfighter. The secu rity of the nation depends on interconnected systems, such as th e power grid, telecommunications systems, social and organizational networks , economic and financial systems and command and control structur es. These networks can suffer dramatic failures (examples include the Mi dwestern power grid outage and the increasingly mission-critical yet fragile internet infrastructure). Such failures can potentially be prevented or controlled through a fundame ntal, quantitative understanding of the intrinsic properties of networks, or more generally, any interconnected system. Deeper sc ientific foundations for what might be called \" network understanding\" will eventually generate dram atic new capabilities for the DoD while at th e same time generating benefits for ci vilian applications. Overall, the program will provide vastly e xpanded power and improved inte raction for a wide range of military tasks and environ ments. (U) Research on machine intelligence over the l ast two decades has revealed that many r easoning problems are inherently computation al complex, and in many cases, intractable. The Real-World Reasoni ng thrust (REAL) is developing foundational technologies, heuri stic approaches, and tools necessary to enable effective, practical machine reasoning about increasingly complex, large-scale proble ms on time scales and with accuracies that will aid commanders and warfighters in assessing the consequences of specific actions and strategies, and predict future results. This research will push the envelope of deep-reasoning d ecision-making by systematically considering interactions amo ng multiple teams of warfighters, robots and weapon systems in strategic settings wher e each team may have different or varying goals. The key t echnologies under investigation are effective, practical inferential reasoning in r eal-world situations with complexity and uncertainty; novel pa radigms for learning from experience, events, and actions that affect the final outco me of a situation or scenario; integration of multiple reasonin g paradigms; representation and reasoning with information that changes constantly over time; reas oning about the goals of other agents; pra gmatic reasoning that uses appropriate default assumptions to respond intelligentl y; and appropriate metrics fo r measuring cognitive behavior an d performance. 14UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2005 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA1 Basic Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Defense Research Sciences PE 0601101E, Project CCS-02 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 1 Page 15 of 28 (U) Program Plans: Develop new forms of human-computer interac tion that enable humans and computers to wo rk as synergistic teams.

Control Plane seeks to develop the ability for indivi dual hosts (end-points) to lear n essential characteristics about the network path between themselves and ot her hosts, allowing the hosts to shape any transmission to pass through the network with the minimal network load. Additionally, when multip le network paths are available, a host will be able to either choose the path that best meets its requirements or simultaneously transmit over multip le paths. This technology w ill support the Defense Departmen t's Global Information Grid concept of operations. (U) Program Plans: Develop mechanisms to improve end-to-end Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) wide-area network performance between the Continental United States (CONUS ) operating base and forward deployed tactical units.

Such a n institute is envisioned as a key asset to relevant DoD/U.S. Government agen cies whose charter includes seeking to ensure access to informati on systems, maintaining the U.S. edge in informati on operations, leveraging advances in inform ation technologies, and ensuring DoD's abilit y to provide end- to-end interoperable communications in the long-term. The ins titute would develop the techniques and formal methods to validat e the 'networthiness' of networked weapons systems. Currently, softwa re/firmware/hardware systems can be checked for correct behavio r and code security at the individual program or module level. However, once these systems are integrated into a network, they are assume d to work correctly across the network. Generally, there is no effort to validate this assumption and there are no established procedures or metho dologies to validate these systems. As a result, the Defense Department's relian ce on networks for future opera tions may be jeopardized. 51UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2005 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Information and Communications Technology PE 0602303E, Project IT-03 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 12 Page 24 of 30 (U) Program Plans: Working with likely DoD transition partners, such as the Defense Information Systems Agen cy (DISA) or the Directorate of Test a nd Evaluation (DOT&E), establish goals, eval uation criteria and metrics needed to t horoughly vet potential research institutes.

(U) Program Accomplishments/Planned Programs: Narrative Title FY 2004 FY 2005 FY Situation Presentation and Interaction (10.870) 11.500 11.616 14.387 (U) There are two programs involving direct speech-to-speech translation: The Compact Aids for Speech Translation (CAST) program is provi ding the tactical warfighter with real-time, face-to-face speech translation during combat and humanitarian operations in foreig n territories. The program addresses domain-specific translatio n accuracy and response time. Early CAST prototypes re lied on simple dictionaries and phrases. The CAST program resulted primarily in qu ickly making one-way translation systems (from English to multiple fore ign languages) available to warfighters in the field. The DAR PA Phraselator is the key prototype system in use today. The syst em was deployed in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Endurin g Freedom. Future versions will offer a more sophisticated, flex ible and fluid translation and paraphrasing capability that is r obust and conducive to normal human conversations.

The program addr esses the issues surrounding the rapid deployment of new languages, esp ecially, low-resource languages and dialects. TRANSTAC will b uild on existing speech translation platforms developed in CAST to create a rapidly deployable language tool that will meet the mili tary's language translation needs. For example, the program will a dd a two-way translation capability and will include Arabic dialect s spoken in Iraq (the current Phraselator uses only Modern Standard Arabic).

The program has been developing technology to enable English-speaking operators and analysts to exploit the huge amounts of foreign speech and text (broadcast and newswi re) that currently go unanalyzed due to shortages of skilled f oreign language analysts. TIDES is creating new capabilities for Transla tion (converting foreign language material to English), Detec tion (finding or discovering needed information, e.g. topics), Extr action (pulling out key information including entities and relati ons), and Summarization (substantially shortening what a user must read). TIDES technology w ill dramatically increase the quantity, qual ity, and timeliness of analysis and reporting, thereby providing vital in formation to senior decision-makers and enabling commanders to carry out critical missions more swiftly, safely, and effectively. Effective, Affordable, Reusable Speech-To-Text (EARS) is crea ting new automatic transcription (speech-to-text) technology whose output is substantially richer and more accurate than previously possible. Fast, accurate , automatic transcription of broadcasts, tel ephone conversations and multiparty speech will make rapid search and analysis of speech possible. EARS also provides text versions o f spoken language for input to systems developed in TIDES, thereby extending the scope of what is possible with automatic translation, d etection, extraction, and summarization. Global Autonomous Language Exploitation (GA LE) will revolutionize the exploitation of both speech and text in multiple language s (which is currently slow, labor-intensive , and limited) by developing core enabli ng technologies and end-to-end systems for ins ertion into a series of high-impact military and intelligence operational settings. GALE will substantially improve upon and exploit capab ilities developed under TIDES, build off of the successes of both TIDES and EARS, and emphasize the creation of a systems framework for integrating the component language processing technologies, evalua ting them based on their utility in various end-user tasks. GALE technology will enable machines to convert a nd distill enormous volumes of streaming sp eech and text in many languages to provi de critical intelligence.

The technol ogy will allow computational systems to have reasoning and lear ning capabilities and levels of autonomy far beyond those of today's systems. With the ability to reason, learn and adapt, and with facilities f or self-awareness, these will literally be systems that know what they are doing, en abling new levels of capability and powerful new applications. This program element and the projects funded within it were created in accordan ce with congressional intent in the FY 2005 DoD appropriation s bill with prior year funding budgeted in PE 0602301E, Projects ST-30, ST-31, and ST-32. (U) Cognitive Systems are different from conventional computing systems in that they manipulate rich structured representations of their knowledge, learn from experience and add to their store of knowle dge, mix symbolic logical knowle dge with uncertain and probabi listic information, allow reflective self-aware inference, and support th e transition of perceptual (e.g., visual, auditory) data to s ymbolic information. These capabilities are not well matched to the architectures that support more conventional computing. The Cognitive Systems C omputing Foundation project is developing the tools and architecture necessary to support the cognitive computing revolution. 59UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2005 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Cognitive Computing Systems PE 0602304E, R-1 # 13 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 13 Page 2 of 34 (U) The Learning, Reasoning, and Integrated Cognitive Systems project will develop core technologies that enable computing systems to learn, reason and apply knowledge gained th rough experience, and respond intelligently to things that have not been previously encountered. These technologies will lead to systems demonstrating increased se lf-reliance, self-adaptive rec onfiguration, intelligent negot iation, cooperative behavior and survivability with reduced human intervention. (U) The Collective Cognitive Systems and Interfaces project will dram atically improve warfighter and commander effectiveness by developing revolutionary methods for users to interact with and direct cognitive syst ems (including the physical sensors and ef fectors).

The novel forms of computat ion developed in Cognitive Systems will revolutionize future military systems. Ne xt-generation computer systems will rely upon reasoning, learn ing, and self- monitoring to handle increasingly complex tasks. These systems will be advisable, adaptable and able to cope with surprise. T he Cognitive Systems Foundations project will develop the necessary foundational so ftware methods and hardware architectures to facilitate t he learning and inference crucial to intelligent computing. These new computing foundations will help us move fa r beyond today's standard Von Neumann computing model. (U) Cognitive Systems for military applications must be robust and r esistant to both attacks and system failures. The military fac es new aggressive and agile threats that have sufficient technical r esources to mount sophisticated attacks using easily accessible co mmercial information systems. The pervasive nature of both the threat and its mean s drives the need for systems to dynamically adapt, collect and a ssimilate large quantities of systems operation data, and remain robust even under aggressive attacks or failure conditions. Cognitive Systems Foundations will enable future computer systems to be more responsible for thei r own configuration, monitoring, protection and restoration to fu ll functional and performance capabilities after an attack or failure.

ACIP will develop the micro-architectu re concepts, framework, and development environments th at will provide the basis for and enable innovative and efficient cognitive informati on processing. Current intelligent processing implementations depend on the use of existing numerically-based architectures and/or standard so ftware architectures, and are therefore built on algorithms and pro cessing foundations that are potentially ill-suited to cognitive ta sks. Architectures that more directly mirror the symbolic reasoning, learning, and percep tion functions of a cognitive syst em are needed to enable majo r advances in this area. The ACIP program will establish core processing capabilities that significantly advance the state of the art at all impl ementation processing levels - modules, systems, and underlying cognitive processing approaches, algorithms and architectures. In order to focus and establish context for the ACIP program, ACIP will pursue in-c ontext DoD focused mission areas for the deve lopment of new data processing concepts . ACIP will develop implementations that span the areas of perception, r easoning and representation, learni ng, communication and interactio n. The ACIP program will enable new classes of cognitive information processing a pplications that move the U.S. dramatically toward the ove rall goal of creating computer systems that know what they are doing.

SRS technol ogy will employ innovative techniques like biologically-inspi red diversity, cognitive immunity and hea ling, granular and scalable redundancy, a nd higher-level functions such as reasoning, reflection and learning. These technol ogies will make critical future information systems more rob ust, survivable and trustworthy. The SRS program will also develop technologies to mitigate the insider threat. Beyond graceful degradation capa bilities provided by fault- and intrusion-tolerance mechanis ms developed in prior DARPA programs, SRS- enabled systems will be able to reconstitut e their full functional and performance capabilities after experiencing an accident al component failure, software error, or even an intentio nal cyber-attack. They will also maintain robustness and trustworthiness attributes even with growth and evoluti on in functionality and performan ce.

Security-aware systems will a void brittleness and vulnerability by reasoning about their own sec urity attributes, capabilities and functions with respect to specific mission needs. Security -aware systems will also dynamically adapt to provide desired le vels of service while minimizing risk and providing coherent explanations of the relative safety of service level alternatives. In add ition, these systems will bolster the reliability and security of critical open sour ce software systems by reducing vulnerabilities and logic errors , and providing state-of- the-art software analysis techniques augmen ted with cognitive decision-making techniques. (U) The Application Communities (AC) program will leverage the res earch conducted under DARPA's in formation assurance programs to create a new generation of self-defending software that automatic ally responds to threats and provides a comprehensive picture of security properties and current status, displayed at multiple levels of abstraction and formality. This capability will bring intellige nt security adaptation to DoD systems and make security properties and status more appa rent to decision-makers, thus increasing the speed and confidence with which military systems can be securely and dynamically reconfigured, particularly under stressful conditions. AC technology will ena ble collections of similar systems to collaboratively generate a shared awarene ss of security vulnerabilities, vulnerability mitigation strategies , and early warnings of attack. AC will revolutionize the security of general-purpose in formation systems and reduce the threat from stealth attacks w here attackers take control of systems undetected. In addition, this program w ill develop quantitative information assurance measurement technique s to enable military system integrators to construct ne tworks and information systems with a high degree of confidence that the systems are protected against cyber-attacks (by the assurance properties of available component s). The technology will greatly enhance the reliability and s ecurity of C4ISR systems.

These capabilities will make the difference be tween mission degradation or failure and mission success, e ven in the event of cyber-attack or component attrition resulting from kinetic warfare or accidental faults and errors. Systems that learn and rea son will reduce the requirement for skilled system administrators and dramatically reduce the overall cost of system maintenance. As the military moves towards a dynamic expeditionary force, it is critical fo r systems to become more self-sufficient. (U) The Learning, Reasoning and Integrated Cognitive Systems project will develop core technologies that enable computing systems to learn, reason and apply knowledge gained through experience, and to r espond intelligently to new and unforeseen events. These technol ogies will lead to systems with increased self-reliance, intelligent negotiation capability, cooperative behavior, the capacity to reconfigure themselves, and survivability with reduced human interventi on. In cognitive architectures, there ar e three primary types of processes: reactiv e, deliberative and reflective. Reactive processes respond quickly and directly to known stimuli; deliberative processes embody what is usually kn own as \"thinking;\" and reflective (higher-order) processes allow a system to \"step back\" and evaluate the environment and its own capabilities to decide the next appropriate course of action. Each of these processes will be improved through learning. Individual technical capabilities de veloped in this project include novel representations for knowledge, skill learning, algorithms for automated reasoning (deductive, abductive, planning, strategic inference, and hybrid approaches), pattern detection capabilities, and language learning. Overall, the project will extend fun damental computing capabilities to deal with real-world information complexity and un certainty. This program element and project were created in accordance with congressional intent in the FY 2005 DoD appropriations bill. Pr ior year funding was budgeted in PE 0602301E, Project ST-30 and is noted as a memo entry in each program below. 69UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2005 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Cognitive Computing Systems PE 0602304E, Project COG-02 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 13 Page 12 of 34 (U) Program Accomplishments/Planned Programs: Narrative Title FY 2004 FY 2005 Integrated Cognitive Systems (31.046) 45.409 57.192 63.063 (U) The Integrated Cognitive Systems technology thrust will develop advanced technology to enable a new class of integrated, highly functional cognitive systems capable of greatly assisting military commanders and decision makers. This thrust will build upon prior DARPA programs that developed improved human-comput er interaction capabilities and highly-responsive computing systems. Integrated c ognitive systems will seamlessly fuse perceptual inputs and tie newly percei ved data to prior knowledge a nd experience. They will be ab le to plan ahead and will understand the world well enough to plausibly anticipate fu ture events. Most importantly, these systems will have emb edded learning capabilities that will allow them to retain prior learned knowledge , apply this knowledge to new scenarios, and ultimately prov ide faster and more effective responses. Overall, the ability to learn will enable the performance of a cognitive system to improve over time. Th e Integrated Cognitive Systems thrust comprises the Personalized Assistant that Learns (PAL) and Cognitive Command, Control, Communication, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Rec onnaissance (Cognitive C4ISR) programs. The Personalized Assistant that Learns (PAL) program will devel op integrated cognitive systems that act as personalized, execut ive-style assistants to military commanders and decision makers. This pr ogram will demonstrate cognitive systems that use basic knowledg e and past experience to help them understand and seek input. Initia lly the program will strive to create assistant programs that di splay basic interaction competencies with people and other assistant programs in an operational environment. Some of these basic competenc ies include sending and receiving information in a natural manner; re lating information and activities in various media; interactin g with the assistant's user and inferring preferences; executing procedures correctly; and accepting coaching and guidance expressed in na tural language. In a unified multitasking, mixed-initiative architect ure, these integrated cognitive systems will push the limits of technology for formal reasoning and learning. Methods for processing raw data will be learned in a way that optimizes performance of the enti re system and enables the same purposeful perception that makes natural syst ems successful in dealing with huge amounts of input data and a constantly changing world. One of PAL's goa ls is the development of advisable system s technology that yields systems that warf ighters and other end-users can control in a natural and flexible manner, e.g., by exchanging advice and instructions, rather than via menus or programming. The term \"advice\" refers to a series of instruc tions that span a spectrum ranging from high-level policy and goal s, to 70UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2005 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Cognitive Computing Systems PE 0602304E, Project COG-02 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 13 Page 13 of 34 intermediate preferences and constraints on system behavior, to specific direction and continge ncy actions. The end-user will be able to engage in a natural dialogue with the system, and th e advice will be translated to an executable form. The Cognitive Command, Control, Communication, Computers, In telligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (Cognitive C4ISR) program will develop embedded learning and real-time reasoning elements along with multimodal dialog-based interfaces to enable a new generation of cognitive C4ISR. These technologies will support eff ective decision-making in the face of the increased pressure s, ambiguity, deception and surprise of today's military operations. The embedded learning element will provide faster response t imes by allowing a system to retain and apply what it has learned in the past. Real-time reasoning allows the system to apply what has been learned to new scenarios in an intelligent and thorough way. Th e multimodal dialogue technology transition to the military wil l emphasize adaptable and scalable architectures and automatic dialogue that addresses human stress adaptation, prosody and system reliabil ity. The Cognitive C4ISR transition efforts will assist commanders by provid ing critical information in a timely manner, with alternativ e courses or action, to enable more effective decision-making.

Narrative Title FY 2004 FY 2005 FY 2006 FY 2007 Foundational Learning Technology (11.112) 26.224 38.830 55.282 (U) The Foundational Learning Technology thrust seeks to develop advanced machine learni ng techniques that enable cognitive systems to continuously learn, adapt and respond to ne w situations by drawing inferences from past experience. The application of this te chnology will result in military systems that are more robust, self-sufficient, and re quire minimal or no platform-specific customization. Current projects will develop hybrid learning techniques to create cognitive systems capable of learning military strategy, leveraging large amounts of prior knowledge, incorporating external guidance and applying prior knowledge in r eal-time to the naturally changing environment, all without pr ogrammer intervention. The Foundational Learning Technology thrust comprises Real-World Learning, Bio-Inspired Cognition , and Learning Locomotion and Navigation. The Real-World Learning thrust will explore the integration and application of a dvanced machine learning techniques to enable cognitive computing systems that learn from experience and adapt to changi ng situations. The program will emphasize the ability to trans fer knowledge and skills learned for specific situ ations to novel, unanticipated situations and perform appropria tely and effective ly the first 72UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2005 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Cognitive Computing Systems PE 0602304E, Project COG-02 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 13 Page 15 of 34 time a novel situation is encountered. The program will drive th e design and implementation of new hybrid learning technologie s, such as large-scale transfer learning, multi-purpose extensible knowledge learning, learning with minimal direction and learning genera lized task models. The program will stress technologies that combine sta tistical learning techniques with knowledge-based techniques that take into account background knowledge and a priori experience. Cognitive systems will a) learn and represent vast amounts of knowledge in forms that can be applied to unknown situ ations and domains; b) generalize learned knowledge and apply it to dynamic and unpred ictable situations and c) reason about a situation or environment. Real-World Learning will enable systems to execute unanticipated ta sks with minimal direction and will provide a much-needed military capabili ty for coping with dangerous and unpredictable situations. The Bio-Inspired Cognition thrust (formerly Neuromorphic Learni ng Technology) will draw on con tinuing advances in neurophysiolo gy and cognitive psychology to gui de and augment traditional artificial intelligen ce (AI) approaches to learning, reasoning, memor y, knowledge acquisition and organizati on, and executive functions. The work will focu s on novel designs inspired by the function , representation and structure of the brain. This approach w ill expand traditional AI technologies from complex symbolic process ing to new capabilities in memory, categorization, pattern recognition and fusi on of perceptual/sensor information. Computational intelli gence is in its infancy, whereas the human brain is the product of millions of years of evolutionary development. Thus, designing software inspired by the brain's processing schemes can offer leap-ahead advances in cognitive systems. These systems will seek to emulate human performance in exploiting past experience in novel situations, learning in multiple ways, fusing multiple perceptual inputs in real-time, extracting concepts from specific experiences, forming hierarchi es of associated memories and concepts, and directing attention through a complex executive process. This thrust w ill take a fresh look at the design and implementation of bio-inspired cognitive archi tectures modeled after human cognition that combine principles from neuroscience and cognitive psyc hology with traditional artificial intelligence- based symbol processing and knowledge representation. Success will, in part, be measured by the ability of the systems develop ed to deal effectively with novel situations and resp ond appropriately in reasonable timeframes. This thrust has the potential to revolut ionize a broad range of military applications through break through performance of intelligent machines. The Learning Locomotion and Navigation thrust will develop lear ning and reasoning technologies that specifically address concer ns in robotic systems. The resulting robotic systems will learn automa tically to interpret sensor data and apply this knowledge to t he control of their actuators, which will improve locomotiv e and navigational autonomy in complex envi ronments. Approaches in reinforcement learning and technologies for learning from example will be expl ored. These technologies will open new horizons for unmanned m ilitary operations, surveillance and reconnaissance, and will dramatically advance the capab ilities of autonomous vehicles.

This thrust comprises two components: Learn ing Applied to Ground Robots (navigation) and Learning Locomotion. (U) Program Plans: Real-World Learning. -- Selected several critical problems and scenarios to challenge machine learning technology in ways that will determine the essential value of individual techniques. -- Establish a testbed of complex multi-agent environments for ge neration of specific and novel situations to use for evaluating learning techniques and components. -- Design and develop hybrid learning systems that allow cognitive sy stems to generalize based on information gathered and learned to operate successfully in similar, but not identical situations; to adapt to a wide variety of naturally-occurring situations; and to perform better over time. -- Demonstrate the ability of a cognitive agen t to learn large amounts of knowledge fo r performance in a specified domain on an unknown task. -- Demonstrate the ability of a cognitive agen t to combine and restructure knowledge from multiple domains to solve novel problems. This includes the ability to generalize knowledge from a particular domain, recognize its applicability, and apply i t to a problem in a new domain. It also includes the ability to appl y knowledge effectively and skil ls acquired for one purpose to ot her purposes, and demonstrate the ability to propose novel problem solution methods when specified resources are unavailable. -- Develop a new set of learning algorithms that focus on learning structures or models rather than refining parameter values. -- Develop algorithms that reason about when learning systems s hould ask humans for explicit input and learn processes efficiently from humans as they perform work tasks. -- Create methods for using domain knowledge to guide and direct learning algorithms. -- Demonstrate the ability of learning techniques to improve representation and reasoning performance in complex multi-agent environments. -- Develop the ability of a cognitive agent to solve a problem with incomplete and partially inaccurate directions. -- Develop the ability of a cognitive agent to achieve a goal that is only implicit in a specified task set of directions. 74UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2005 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Cognitive Computing Systems PE 0602304E, Project COG-02 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 13 Page 17 of 34 Bio-Inspired Cognition. -- Begin using a new generalized theory of learning and memory as well as modular biomorphic designs to implement and integrate simulation modules into a series of biomorphic learning systems. -- Investigate the role of parallel architectures, algorithms, and ge neral principles inspired by neuroscience in hybrid learning and adaptive systems. -- Develop two test batteries for testing and evaluating cognitiv e architectures: a \"cognitive decathlon\" for assessing specific skills associated with cognition (e.g., visual perception, memory); and a set of challenge problems, each of which will require a comp lex range of cognitive functions in orde r to be successfully negotiated. -- Using these batteries, compare the performance of biomorphic l earning technologies against those of traditional artificial intelligence. Learning Locomotion and Navigation. -- Explore the integration of various learning technologies to enable rapid adaptation by robots to new physical environments and improve autonomous vehicle speed over rough terrain. -- Develop learning methods that allow their learned navigation algorithms to surpass the perfo rmance of a baseline system. -- Transfer the best performing navigation methods learned on a smal l-scale vehicle to the large robotic vehicle, Spinner, to incr ease speeds in complex environments. -- Explore \"learning from example\" and \"reinforcement learning\" a pplications to develop technology for autonomous vehicle systems to learn from example and from ga thered experience without relying on a pr ogrammer to anticipate all eventualities. -- Create learning locomotion toolkits that will control a di verse set of high degree-of-freedom vehicles on rough terrain. 75UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2005 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Cognitive Computing Systems PE 0602304E, Project COG-02 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 13 Page 18 of 34 Narrative Title FY 2004 FY 2005 23.435 The Technology thrust will develop enabling tec hnologies, methodologies, ontologi es and detailed knowledge base s to achieve the next generation of intelligent, knowledge-intensive systems. This work will focus on developing technology that sp ans the spectrum from large, strategic knowledge banks to sm all, individual knowledge-based systems. The Knowledge-Base Technology thrust compr ises Knowledge-Based Systems and Bootstrapping Cognitiv e Systems with Implicit Semantic Knowledge. The Knowledge-Based Systems program will de velop technologies to acquire, codify, link, integrate, and use complex and cross- disciplinary knowledge at varying scales. At a strategic level, this capability will pr ovide DoD decision-makers with rapid, a s-needed access to relevant background knowledge from a broad spectrum of sources. The knowledge will be expressed in formal knowledge representation languages that allow computers to reason with the knowledge, consider its implica tions, imagine possible future scenarios and query the warfighter for clarification. The significant ch allenges are centered on the fact that critical knowledge involv es temporal information, complex belief structures and uncertainty. Current representation technology is inadequate to capture such inform ation. This program will develop technology needed to enable the creation of individual knowledge-based systems that would incorporate into the reasoning process (in a computer-understandabl e form) knowledge of the warfighter's r esponsibilities, approach, tasks and activ ities. Another goal of this program is to support the warfighter's ability to understa nd the \"big picture\" for mission planning, monit oring and re- planning. By formalizing situation-mode l representations, automated support will be pr ovided to commanders and analysts for pr ediction of unforeseen events and determination of relevance of isolated or partial events to the evolvi ng situation. To achieve these objectives, this program will develop analogical and case-based reasoning, la nguages and situation markup lan guages technologies, and forma lized situation representations. An additional goa l is the development of technologies for rich, high-fidelity simulation models of human learning, reasoning and behavior. The program will also explore some new ways for knowledge to be transferred efficiently to a knowledge base including by reading tutorial text intended to convey new concepts to a cognitive system. The Bootstrapping Cognitive Systems with Implicit Semantic Know ledge program will explore a new technique for creating cognitiv e systems that store knowledge about the choices the warfighter has made in the past, so when faced with a similar task, the syst em would select a performance method by referring back to previous decision s. Although not appropriate for all cognitive systems tasks, this action- 76UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET February 2005 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Cognitive Computing Systems PE 0602304E, Project COG-02 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 13 Page 19 of 34 centric technique should be effective for simple tasks, such as information gathering to support mission planning or intelligen ce analysis. Most cognitive research is predicated on explicit representation (i .e., having models of the world) and reasoning about the way to achieve a specific goal or meet specific need. Wh ile this approach is effective, encoding the knowledge and reasoning procedures is la bor intensive and expensive. This program w ill develop a new technique that eliminates the material investment required by traditi onal approaches. This approach will replace deep reasoning and deep semantics with implicit reasoni ng and semantics derived from ac tual warfighter performance and experience. (U) Program Plans: Knowledge-Based Systems. -- Develop methods, protocols, and tools fo r using interoperable knowledge modules r esident on distributed knowledge servers. -- Develop integrated knowledge representation and learning technolo gy that enables effective representation of essential forms of knowledge. Document a substantial library of formal declarative interoperable multi- use ontologies initially across single, then multiple domains. -- Demonstrate and evaluate prototypes of stra tegic and individual knowledge-based systems. -- Develop representations of events and me thods for separating and tracking their association to merge multiple scenarios, assimilate one event within the context of the othe r, and identify where events deviate from the norm. -- Explore novel methods for acquiring new knowledge that are less onerous than traditional methods requiring hand-coding by experts including direct input thr ough processing natural language text. Bootstrapping Cognitive Systems w ith Implicit Semantic Knowledge. -- Develop algorithms based on implicit semantic knowledge that en able cognitive systems to exam ine a current goal, and then decide how to achieve that goal based on what the warfighter has done in the past. -- Evaluate and test the implicit semantic knowledge algorithms on a variety of different domains or application areas to assess t he utility of the approach and its eff ectiveness for different applications. -- Create distributed agent scribes that learn operations from th e performer and store these operations along with the implicit semantic knowledge in a repository for future automation. 77UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2005 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Cognitive Computing Systems PE 0602304E, Project COG-02 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 13 Page 20 of 34 (U) Other Program Funding Summary Cost: Not Applicable. 78UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 13 Page 21 of 34 RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2005 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Cognitive Computing Systems PE 0602304E, Project COG-03 COST (In Millions) FY 2007 FY 2008 FY 2009 Collective Cognitive Systems and Interfaces project will dram atically improve warfighter and commander effectiveness and productivity by developing revolutionary methods that increase the individual warfighter's/commander's information processing c apabilities, enhance situational awareness in urban and battlefield operations, and enable team co llaboration through en sured network commun ications. (U) A unique aspect of natural perceptual systems is their ability to filter and integrate vast amounts of raw sensor data, such as visual flow and rich auditory input; rapidly segment the resultant data into meaningful elements; and integrate them into a coherent pictur e. The human perceptual system is able to create perceptual units that par cel the world into objects and di screte entities, which are then r ecognized, remembered and used in problem solving. Looking closely at these innate perception abilities will yield in sights into how to build totall y novel computational systems that identify important, low-frequency events in a noisy e nvironment. This kind of approach should lead to dramatic im provements in the ability of a computer to process and analyze huge amounts of data to form a high-level understandi ng within its environment. R obust interaction among cognitive systems, legacy systems and warfighters will require incorporation of advanced m odels and control of the networ k infrastructure to ensure adequate provisioning of quality-of-service under d ynamic loads. Together, these technologies will allow the warfigh ter to focus on high-level mission objectives rather than low-level maintenance of supporting systems. At the same time the technology will en sure that the warfighter maintains essential understanding of how (and how well) the system is implementing and responding to high-level dire ction. (U) This project will focus on methods for users to interact with a nd direct cognitive systems (including the physical sensors and effectors); technologies to reduce the personnel and labor required for set up a nd maintenance of tactical and strategic networks; and tech niques for retrieving and interpreting relevant collected information. High-level languages will be developed for rapid and precise specification of complex behavior in response to mission demands. Since it is equally important for th e warfighter or commander to understand the system as it is f or the system to understand the user's goals and n eeds, this project will develop technologies that give systems the ability to explain, perceiv e and reason about their behavior and actions. While development of stand-alone cognitive systems re presents a huge leap forward, real, complex m ilitary missions require teams of these systems to work collaboratively. The pr oject will also develop those technologies necessary to enable s uch systems to collaborate effectively and to take advantage of the power of collective cognitive agents. 79UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2005 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Cognitive Computing Systems PE 0602304E, Project COG-03 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 13 Page 22 of 34 (U) The suite of programs conducted under project will significantly ad vance the military's ability to address and deal with comple x situations in operational environments.

This thrust will develop technologies t o enable systems to detect and assess the user's cognitive state (e.g., le vel of attention, memory retention, and decision-making capabi lities) and adapt to optimize the user's understanding and productivity. The work will significantly expand the warfighters' capabilities in a real -time operational environment by enhancing information throug hput and retention, and executive function efficiency. This thrust will also help c reate context-based computational systems that will understand, predict and participat e in goal-directed collaboration to maintain situational awar eness and assist the warfighter in the decision-making process. Recent progress in neur al science, computation and miniaturization can now be lever aged to enable new concepts of warfare. The technologies developed under this thrust will revolutio nize the way 21st Century warriors and com manders interact with computer-based systems, implement adva nced systems design methodologies, and fundamentally re-engineer military decision-m aking processes. The IWIP thrust comprises two programs: Improving Wa rfighter Information Intake under Stress and Context-Based Comp uting for Command and Control. The Improving Warfighter Information Intake under Stress program will enhance operational effectiveness through a set of cognit ive techniques that specifically improve 1) the amount of informa tion that warfighters can handle, thereby reducing manpower requir ements (e.g., one person doing the j ob of three); 2) attention management during str essful operations; and 3) information retention (m emory). The program will develop the means, devices and infrastructure neces sary to assess the warfighter's or commander's cognitive status in real time, and use adaptive strategies specific to his/her status to improve information processing a nd decision-making.

The research will also pursue perceptual processi ng-based displays that are sensitive to information processing mechanisms inherent in the human perceptual system to invent, modify and redesign devices that more effectively deliver content to the operator. Such wor k will include designing and building adaptive multimodal interfaces th at improve the battlefield and command center communications, a nd exploiting all of the digital information currently available in a static command environment. DARPA has established an MOA wi th the U. S. Army Soldier and Biological Chemical Command and the Naval Air Systems Command for transition of this program. The Context-Based Computing for Command and Control (CBC3) program will demonstrate dramatic improvements in command decision-making and situational awareness, in real time, based on the development of \"context-based computing.\" CBC3 will also capture, in real time, the context (situation assessment including info rmation about places, people, time, functional activities, etc.) critical for supporting the decision-maker. Software tools and agent services will be provided to support the rapid creation of interoperab ility capabilities for information exchange in heter ogeneous environments. The long-term impact of this work will be to provide user s with vastly expanded expressive power, interface flexibility and transp arency, timely access to relevant information, and greater ov erall utility and robustness of interaction with next -generation military digital systems.

Such situations typically require multiple coord inated tasks that involve information sharing and cooperative efforts. The Colla borative Cognition thrust will foster the design and implementat ion of collaborative software agents in dynamic environments that include both softwa re agents and people. Applica tions include collaborative surve illance and reconnaissance systems, logistics re-planning and decision support for unanticipated operational changes, situational analysis and prediction tools, and other aids to human decision-making. The technology develope d will also allow software agents to cope with limited and/or noisy sensor information, limited communication capabilities, changing and unforeseen environments, other agents, and limited a priori knowledge of each other's capabilities. The Collaborative Cognition technology thru st consists of three program s: Collaborative Cognition System s, Coordination Decision-Support Assistants (COORDINATORs), and Advanced So ldier Sensor Information System and Technology (ASSIST). The Collaborative Cognition Systems program will develop software for controlling agen t computer programs capable of interacting with both friendly and adversarial software agen ts, and operating in multiple domains and/or varying scenarios within the same domai n. The application of learning and reasoning technology in an explicitl y collaborative setting will allow systems to modify themselves based on experience and information exchanged among multiple team members; this will enable adept control of agent programs under previo usly unseen or unknown conditions. This work will also explore revolu tionary concepts for applying distributed agent technology to modeling and simulation systems. The long-term goal is to apply this technology to operational environments, thereby significantly adva ncing deployed system capabilities. The Coordination Decision-Support Assistants (COORDINATORs) program will develop cognitive software coordination managers that provide support to fielded tactical teams. The coordination ma nagers will help fielded units adapt their mission plans in resp onse to inevitable, unanticipated changes in the mission and conflict situ ation by keeping track of personnel, resources, situational c hanges, and proposing and evaluating options (adjustments to task timings, changes to task assignments and selection from pre-planned conti ngencies). This will enable fielded units to respond faster and more accurately to the dynamica lly changing battlefield situation with far fewer 83UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2005 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Cognitive Computing Systems PE 0602304E, Project COG-03 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 13 Page 26 of 34 personnel required in the re-planning coor dination process. COORDINATORs is a distributed technology. A single COORDINATOR will be partnered with each tactical unit or team, and will be able to collaborate and coordinate with other tactical units to optimize needed mission changes. A key lesson learned from Operation Iraqi Freedom is the importa nce of accurate observational reporting by ground soldiers. Th e Advanced Soldier Sensor Information System and Technology (ASSIST) program will develop an integrated information system that exploits soldier-worn sensors to augment the soldier's ability to capture, report, and share information in the field. Communi cation of timely and accurate information is vital for enhanced situa tional understanding and overall ope rational effectiveness in urban combat and post-conflict stability operations. While a range of standardized reporting mechanisms are in use today, the confusion of the battlefield/urban operations combined with ph ysical and psychological stresses on the warfighters can make the task of reportin g very difficult. Furthermore, existing verbal and text-format reports limit the soldier's ability to capture and convey the full pic ture, particularly annotated visual information. The ASSIST program will develop an integrated system using advanced technologies for processing, digitizing and analyzing information captured and collected by so ldier-worn sensors. It will draw heavily on the experiences a nd lessons learned from previous Iraqi and other surv eillance and reconnaissance missions.

The technology will improve information sharing and situational awareness by robu stly and dynamically networking teams of agents and warfighte rs. Self- Sufficient Collective Systems concepts will enable warfighters to take full advantage of all available information and bring to bear all available assets in a rapid and flexible manner. (U) The Cognitive Collectives for Autonomic Situa tion Awareness thrust will create software technologies that enable future warfigh ters to form a collective unit and share information automatically. This will provide the warfighters with a broad tactical battlespac e awareness. The selection, generation, sharing and display of information will be handled by cognitive software systems coupled with each warfi ghter. The network of individual systems will form a collective. Each syst em will monitor the sensors att ached to its associated soldier, collect situational information and reason about the soldiers' ope rational environment.

These technologies will allow the military to focus its critical manpower resources on the mission rather than on the maintenance of its information systems and network infrastructure. Resear ch in this area will create a radical new design for distributed computers, device networks, and the software to manage these systems. It will also attempt to create a \"cognitive enhanced radio\" capability, which uses cogn itive information processing to optimize communication based on current conditions, past experience and high-level user guidance. The Cognitive Networki ng thrust comprises three programs: Universal Adaptive Controller for Mission-Aware Ad-Hoc Networks, Self-Sustaining Peer-to-Peer Systems, and Situation-Aware Protocols in Edge Netwo rk Technologies. (U) An outgrowth of the Adaptive Networking program, the Universal Adaptive Controller for Mission-Aware Ad-Hoc Networks (UNMAN) program will develop an adaptive configura tion management capability that dramatica lly reduces life-threatening communication f ailures in complex communication networks. In order to develop this new capability, the initial fo cus is on the tactical mobile ad-hoc ne tworks (MANETs). As are other critical networks, MANETs are composed of interdepe ndent nodes based on interdependent system layers. Each node e xposes dozens to hundreds of configurable paramete rs that must be continuously adapted due to variable tactical factors such as missio n profile, phase, force structure, enemy activity, and environmental conditions. Th e complexity of this high-dimensional, adaptive, constrained, distributed network configuration problem is overwhelming to human operators and designers. Furthermore, today's commercial trends are not aimed at supporting the DoD's extreme deployments. This program will take on the ambitious goal of addressing the integrated management of all network layers simultaneously. Key technical challenges include missi on understanding and mapping mission requirements to goals for ea ch of the network's agents in order to optimize instantaneous resource a llocation. These challenges are particularly difficult in a dist ributed setting with partial and uncertain information, high co mmunications overhead, and high probability of failure. To address this problem, the UNMAN program will develop new mission-aware, adaptive, distributed, active l earning and reasoning technologies that will provide a robust an d effective configuration capability for MANETs. 87UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET February 2005 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Cognitive Computing Systems PE 0602304E, Project COG-03 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 13 Page 30 of 34 (U) The Self-Sustaining Peer-to-Peer Systems program, an outgrowth of the DARPA Networ king program, will develop resilient, scalabl e sensor/computation/communication networks with decentralized cont rol. This technology will enab le continuous monitoring of cri tical areas and targets in remote or inaccessi ble areas through the development of self-forming, large ad hoc networks of sensors and computational elements. Networks will operate within severely re source-constrained environmen ts (power, bandwidth, stealth ) of military operations, whi le enabling critical networks to survive component failu re, network intrusion and the subversion of elements. This self-sustaining network of sensors and communication elements will provide a lifeline to the warfighter in the support of effective operations while automating the bu rdensome and distracting tasks of network deployment, configuration and mana gement. High-level languages will be developed to map the warfi ghter's mission plans, including geographical constraints and direct control of individual sensors, into network control actions. The cognitiv e network technology will provide on-demand sensing, imaging and tracking with a prediction/planning capability to estimate the state and trustworth iness of network elements, communication links, and assets connected by sensors. T hus, as elements fail or are subverted, the Self-Sustaining P eer-to-Peer Systems will control the graceful degradation of any of its parts. Th e program will develop network technology for terabit data stream ing and processing, on-demand networking and methods for mobile, da ta-centric ad-hoc networks. This tec hnology will support a variety of networks of manned and unmanned systems. (U) The Situation-Aware Protocols in Edge Network Technologies (SAPIENT) program will develop a new gene ration of cognitive protocol architectures to replace conventional protocols that fare poorly in extreme network conditions a nd do not provide adequate serv ice for key applications. Technology developed in th e SAPIENT program will have military utility wherever tactical communications are depl oyed. SAPIENT architectures will represent awareness with a knowledge base that is updated based on specification and observation. T his technology enables the automatic adaptation of protocols to the operational environment. SAPIENT will exploit attributes of human cogniti on, such as learning and self-improvement to the automated construction of ne twork protocols. Key research challenges for the SAPIENT prog ram are the use of these cognitive attributes to dramatically reduce the effect of network impairments on appli cations and demonstrate a positi ve trend in this capability as new situations are encountered and learned. Desired capabilities include interoperable knowledge representations and rapid incorporation of new knowledge about applica tions, network conditions and building blocks from which new protocols can be const ructed.

This project funds programs supporting revolutionary new appr oaches to biological warfare (BW) defense and does not dupl icate efforts of other government organizations. (U) Efforts to counter the BW threat include developing barriers to block entry of pathogens into the human body (including unique methods for rapid air and water purification), countermeasures to stop pa thogen and chemical consequen ce and to modulate host immune re sponse, medical diagnostics for the most virulent pathogens and their molecular mechanisms, biological and chemi cally-specific sensors, advance d decontamination and neutralization techniqu es, and integrated defensive systems, including detection of chemical and biological agents in sealed containers at entry points of facilities.

Past successes in this effort have come from developing therapeutics that are des igned to work against broad classes of pathogens. This has led to several si gnificant transitions and a separat e thrust in Accelerated Anthr ax. Work in this area has also uncovered new approaches to therapeu tics that, rather than attacking specific pathogens, enhance human innate immune m echanisms against broad classes of pathogens. Not only will these approaches be more effective against known pathogens, they also promis e to offer substantial protection against unk nown pathogens including engineer ed pathogens and emerging path ogens from third-world environ ments. Because activation of the innate immune system also provid es protection from oxidative DNA and cell membrane damage, these appr oaches are now known to provide protection against radia tion exposure in animals. This thrust is also addressing the difficulty in demons trating the efficacy of vaccines against threats that cannot undergo human trials thro ugh the development of tools such as an artificial immune syst em that will provide rapid, in vitro assessments of novel counterm easures against unique DoD threat agents.

(U) Handheld Isothermal Silver Standard Sensor (HISSS) The overall goal of DARPA's Handheld Isothermal Silver Standard Sensor (HISSS) program is to develop a sensor that is capable o f detecting the entire biological warfare threat spectrum (bacteria , DNA viruses, RNA viruses and protein toxins) with the same \" silver standard\" specificity as current laboratory techniques, but in a f ast, reliable, handheld unit. Today, this standard is achiev ed for DNA and RNA threats using polymerase chain reaction, which is slow because of the associated temperature cycling. For proteins, the st andard is met using Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), which requires skilled laboratory technicians to complete. The equipment required for these tests is bulky and difficult to use under fiel d conditions. Under HISSS, DARP A will develop fundamentally n ew ways to exploit previously developed identification mechanisms (DNA a nd RNA primers, protein antibodies) in an integrated, isotherma l system that will allow a single, handheld senso r to detect the full range of BW threats. 97UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET DATE February 2005 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Biological Warfare Defense PE 0602383E, R-1 # 14 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 14 Page 6 of 18 (U) Program Plans: Developed isothermal assays for DNA, RNA and protein toxins and demonstrated a false-alarm rate equivalent to the current laboratory technology.

Design and build a prototype HISSS device. Characterize HISSS prototype in labor atory and operational environments. (U) Triangulation Identification for Genetic Evaluation of Biological Risk (TIGER) Most nucleic acid based sensors search for an exact sequence matc h to some unique part of each pathogen. This requires a uniqu e set of primers and probes for every target pathog en; it also means that the sensor can only determine whether that specific (portion o f the) target pathogen is present. DARPA is developing a new kind of DNA-based sensor that searches out the universal parts of the genetic c ode and looks for species-specific variation between these regions. Th is TIGER sensor will enable a universal sensor for all pathogens and also holds the promise of detecting the presence of never-before-seen (bio-engineered) agents.

Transition and deploy fieldable prototype to support operati onal bio-protection efforts at USAMRIID and NHRC San Diego. (U) Spectral Sensing of Bio-Aerosols (SSBA) Active probing of bioaerosols with electromagnetic (EM) energy holds the promise of extremely fast, and potentially long-range, detection and identification of bio agents. Only a small portion of the EM spectrum is exploited in t oday's trigger sensors (e.g., optic ally based particle sizers, sometimes enhanced with fluorescence measurements). However, anecdot al evidence suggests that other portions of the spectrum may offer substantial improvement in trigger senso rs, as well as potentially agent-specific discrimination capability. Various types of spectra in the visible, infrared, and additional UV wave lengths are being measured in laboratory or early prototype sy stems. Additional spectral information such as UV fluorescence lifetime and single particle mass spectrosc opy is also being evaluated. DARPA is investing in this approach, beginning with cross-spectrum data collection and performance m odels, followed by prototype sens or development. An aerosol testbed has been developed to provide calibrated exposures of threat agent simulants. (U) Program Plans: Completed bioaerosol testbed and standardi zed data-collection protocols to allow the new sensor technologies to be challenged w ith both threat agent simulants and typical interferent s such as diesel smoke, pollen and natural fibers.

The approach is to modify and augment the infrastructure of buildings to allow them to sense and defeat an attack by bio or chem agents in real-time and to find and remove hazardous ra diation left behind by a \"dirty bomb.\" The program has three goals: to protect th e human inhabitants from the effects of the agents; to restore t he building to function quickly after the attack; and to preserve forensic eviden ce for treatment of victims, if necessary, and for attributio n. For CB releases, the DARPA focus is on the challenging problem of protection from intern al releases of agent, where active and timely control of air flow is required to prevent a building's HVAC system from spread ing the agent throughout the building. To enable such building-protection systems, DARPA is developing component technologies such as optimized filtration sy stems, advanced neutralization techniques, active building coa tings, and remediation techniques appropriate to biological, chemical, and radi ological decontamination. In addition, DARPA is investigat ing the systems- level issues of integrating and optimizing such active systems, including the integration and adaptation of sensors, as well as the simulation of threat events and emergency responses. Seve ral new chemical and biological sensors ha ve been identified for development to add ress problems that are unique to the building application. Self-assembling nano-structures for building sealants will be investigated to qui ckly and inexpensively coat building exteriors and completely seal the building, thereb y making effective the defensive strategy of sheltering in plac e. These efforts have used full-scale test facilities to determin e the effectiveness of protection component s and the optimal architectures for prote ction. These systems are being transitioned to a full-scale demonstration of a comple te building protection system at a military installation and wi ll also leave behind a software tool for the design and optimization of bui lding-protection systems for other military facilities.

Narrative Title FY 2004 FY Wide-Area Biological Warfare Agent (BWA) Surveillance program investigated BWA surveillance systems architectures for urban environments, such as military bases and transportation centers, to effectively and efficiently detect covert aerosol releases of BWA and to determine the approximate release location before the onset of symptoms in humans . The program studied the key architecture trades, including: the appropriate mix of stationary and mobile assets (collectors/ samplers and identification sensors); the value of distributed sampling and identification (sensing) versus distributed sampling with centra lized identification; the role of layered sensing, such as cont inuous wide-area surveillance followed by focused/targeted co llects for confirmation; the importance of spatial and temporal resolution in enabl ing backtracking to determine release time and release location; and specialized co llection and identification requirements in different environmen ts. These trades were carried out by modeling covert releases and then analyzing the ability of various architectures (1) to detect the release quickly and (2) to geo- locate the source. The results of these studies provided much of the analytical basis for the Threat Agent Cloud Tactical Inte rcept and Countermeasure (TACTIC) program.

The motivation behind all of the programs is to reduce the exposure of U.S. warfighters w hen they are operating in disadvantageous territory, especially those comple x settings (densely populated and structured areas, multi-storie d buildings, etc.) typically found in urban settings. The Novel Sensors program cons ists of the Unique Signature Detection Project (formerly know n as the Odortype Detection program), the Enemy Di smount Intrusion Detection Project, the Urban Vision Project, the Explosives Detection Project, and congressionally added funds for Tactical Awareness for Friend or Foe.

The program consists of an interdisciplinary team of performers using state- of-the-art techniques to evaluate the statistical, biological a nd chemical nature of individual emanations. Once the nature of the chemosignal has been characterized, performers w ill determine the impact of non- genetic factors (e.g., diet, stress, health, age) on the signal in order to de termine whether the signal can be robustly extracted from a compl ex and varied chemical background. If an exploitable robust signature is identif ied, the program will then pursue detector development. (U) The Enemy Dismount Intrusion Detection Project will develop a ch emical sensor that is capable of providing an advanced warn ing of the presence of enemy troops or combatants by detecting the chemical emissions or pattern of emissions that are common to all human s, but are otherwise not ordinarily encountered in the environment. Th is program will leverage capabiliti es found in nature to recognize and locate the volatile chemicals that are the most reliable indicator of the presence of enemy troops or combatants leading to the developmen t of a sensor and detection scheme that will be capable and robust against false alarms. This detection capability would replace land mines as a way to provide advanced threat warning of approaching enemy combatants to troops involved in perimeter de fense and similar operations. (U) The Urban Vision Project will develop the technology and systems to provide the warfighter with an advanced in-depth view of th e distribution and location of dielectric bodies that resemble those of enemy dismounted troops or combatants within a building i n an urban area. Each node of the array carries a suite of low-power transmitters an d receivers that act in concert with real-time electromagnet ic analysis codes to \"peel back\" the structure of the building and the disposition of signatures that are indicative of enemy dismounted troops or c ombatants within. (U) The Explosives Detection Project seeks to develop technologies capable of standoff (non-contact) detection of explosive com pounds. Of particular importance are high throughput applications, such as military checkpoints, where an ex tremely low false alarm rate i s required. Rather than promoting a single, particular technology, this program will develop a systematic framework of understanding for both the target and background signals. With such an understa nding, concepts such as sensor fusion and the optimum setting of thresholds can be pr operly optimized. In this manner, a system of sensors can be developed that has reliable detection capabilities in both laboratory and field envi ronments. This capability will greatly reduce the threat of suicide bombing, Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), and similar tactics faced by troops in the field. 124UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2005 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Tactical Technology PE 0602702E, Project TT-04 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 16 Page 15 of 64 (U) Program Plans: Unique Signature Detection. -- Identify the chemical make-up of the Major Histocom patibility Complex (MHC)-determined unique signatures. -- Examine the chemistry and impact of non-genetic background signals. -- Design detectors that are capable of identifying high-level-of-int erest individuals within groups of enemy troops or combatants through unique, specific signatures with high reliability.

Narrative Title FY 2004 FY (U) The Walrus program will develop and evaluate a very large airlift vehicle concept that is designed to control lift in all stage s of air or ground operations including off-loading of payload without taking onboard ballast othe r than air. Unlike earlier generation ai rships, it will generate lift through a combination of aerodynamics, thrust vect oring and gas buoyancy generation and management and for much o f the time, it will fly heavier than air. The program will develop an operati onal vehicle concept and will con duct risk reduction demonstrati ons on a Walrus Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD) air vehicle. The ATD ve hicle will demonstrate scalable aircraft technology, is anticip ated to achieve comparable C-130 airlift capability, and will explore, develop, and demonstrate the system concepts of operation. The Walrus o bjective vehicle will have a primary mission to deploy com posite loads of personnel and equipment (for example, the components of a Unit of Acti on) ready to fight as they disembark from the aircraft within 6 hours after landing. Walrus will operate without significant infrastructure and from unimproved landing sites, ostensibly flat but over ro ugh ground to tolerate 5 f eet high obstacles. It will carry a useful payload >500 to ns over global distances (12,000 nm in less than 7 days) at a competitive cost. Additio nally, Walrus will be capable of performing theater lift, suppor t of Sea Basing, and persistence missions to meet a range of multi-agency needs. A dvanced breakthrough technologies will be investigated in the fir st phase to support the development of lift and buoyancy concepts. The program's first phase will include system studies and development of a noti onal concept of the objective vehicle. Based on these studies and concept viab ility, the competitive second phase will lead to the development of an objective air vehicle design and building and initial flight test of the ATD vehicle.

Ultimately, the studies and developme nts under this project may result in the first controllable, recoverable, and reusable hypersonic system demonstration. Initial designs will allow for either a manned or unmanned version, and provide viable options for lo ng-range strike and affordable access to space. The program is di vided into two efforts - the High Speed Turbine Engine Demonstration (H iSTED) and the Scramjet Engine Demonstration (SED). (U) The HiSTED objectives are to design, fabricate, and ground test a hi gh Mach expendable turbine engine capable of Mach 3-4+ oper ation. The objective of the ground demonstration is to verify, via si mulated altitude testing, that engine performance and operability characteristics at key transonic and maximum Mach/altitude cruise flight conditions meet anticipated system applicati on needs. Successful completion of the Phase I ground demonstration will enable Phase II devel opment of a reusable turbine-based combin ed cycle engine capable of accelerating a hypersonic cruise vehicle to Mach 4+. (U) The SED effort seeks to design, fabricate, and fly a hypers onic vehicle powered by the HyTech scramjet engine over a broad range of Mach numbers. The SED flight vehicle will be boosted to Mach 4. 5 where the scramjet engine will be started and the vehicle wil l accelerate to Mach 6.5 to Mach 7+. This will demonstrate a scramjet engine that produces thrust greater than vehicle drag, accelerating a fr ee flight vehicle over a range of Mach numbers. This will be the first-ever demonstration of a flight -weight, fuel-cooled scramjet-powered vehic le. It will also establish the viability of the scramjet engine for integration w ith high speed turbines such as that developed under HiSTED and /or rocket engines to create combined cycle engines for hypersonic cruise ve hicles and affordable on-demand access to space systems.

The Helicopter Quieting Pr ogram is developing revolutionary new rotor blade design tool s that will enable the creation of novel rotor blades that can dramatically reduce the acoustic signature of a helicopter without sacrificing flig ht performance. Current rotor blade development approaches re ly on an iterative cycle of analysis and model wind tunnel tests (time consuming a nd costly) or go straight from analysis to full-scale wind tunnel/flight test (high risk and costly). Because of the significant issues of time , cost, and risk, helicopter rotor designers cannot explore the revolutionary potential of emerging new rotor noise-reducing technologies in the design proc ess. Recent advances in computational fluid dynamics (C FD) will be leveraged to develop physics- based predictive design tools that will all ow designers to develop revolutionary rotor blade designs with vastly improved acoustic characteristics. The predictive tools will be tested u sing existing data sets and data collected from fully instrumented full-scale and model-scal e experiments. The tools will then be used to design new b lades that yield a significant reduction in low-frequency in-p lane signatures without impacting perfo rmance compared to a baseline design.

CZTS w ill provide close-in sensing and extended reconnaissance capabiliti es using a network of video sensors. The system will track vehicles over wi de urban areas using sparse arrays of video cameras and automa tically detect vehicles that may be involved in hostile activities based on th e observed tracks. This network will produce an extreme amount of data for human analysis, so advanced video understanding algorithms embedded in commercial-off-the-she lf hardware systems will monitor video f eeds automatically. Reconnaissance, intelligence, and targeting inform ation needed to provide close-in, 24/7 support for military o perations in urban terrain (MOUT) will then be generated. CZTS will enable vehicle identification with a 10,000-fold reduction in the bandwidth r equired to transmit key data across the camera networ k and will provide the capability to track vehicles non-continuously across extended distances.

Whi le experienced commanders are required to formulate strategy and select tactics, the increased operational tempo will demand more automation of low-level decision processes, such as route-finding, weapon/target pa iring, and sensor scheduling. Some elements of these proc esses, such as collision avoidance and navigation, will be embedded in each platform. However, gr oups of platforms will be able to execute co operative tactics to achieve coordinated effects. This cross-platform coordi nation and synchronization requires new technologies that can carry out aggregate maneuvers and tasks, while leveraging the functions embedded in each platform. This program is developing novel technologies f or multi- platform, automated battle management at the tactical level, in the air, on the ground, and within mobile sensor networks. The Mission Driven Control of Autonomous Robotic Systems (MDC ARS) program will develop autono mous control methods to cause distributed platforms to self-organize and distribute tasks throug h judicious transactions conveyed over a shared communication s network. Techniques to permit rapid insertion of new functional elements (s uch as, new platforms, sensors, control stations, visualizati on tools, algorithms, and databases) into robotic system networks will be explored. MDCARS s upports explicit publication of data models and control strategies used by sensors, algorithms, tools, and data bases and references appropriate knowledge bases to define trans formations between different data models. Products w ill be integrated via semi-automatic tools to accelerate system and information integ ration. This effort permits rapid adaptation of robo tic systems behavior to changes in the real -time military situation. The program a ccelerates configuration and integration of robotic systems at field sit es, enabling rapid technical upgrade, improving interaction with c oalition partners and system tailoring to new envir onments.

(U) A space force structure that is robust against attack represen ts a stabilizing deterrent against adversary attacks on space ass ets. In addition to the ability to detect and characterize potential attacks, robus tness against attack is provided by proliferation of assets, ready access to space, the ability to neutralize man-made space envir onments, and a flexible infrastructure fo r maintaining the capabilities of on-orbit a ssets. Ready access to space allows the delivery of defensive systems and replenishm ent supplies to orbit. An infrastructure to service the missio n spacecraft allows defensive actions to be taken without limiting mission lifetime. In addition, developing sp ace access and spacecraft servicing technologies will lead to reduced ownership costs of space systems and new oppor tunities for introducing technologies for the exploitation of spa ce. Systems development is also required to increase the interactivity of space systems, space-derived information and services with terres trial users. Studies under this project include technologies and systems that will enab le satellites and microsatellites to operate more effectively by increasing maneuverability, survivability, and situati onal awareness; enabling concepts include solar thermal propulsion, novel ion thrust er applications, payload isolation and pointing systems.

The concept consiste d of a responsive, routine, small payload delivery system ca pable of providing flexible access to space using a combination of reusable and lo w cost expendable vehicle elements. Specifically, the RASCAL sy stem concept included a reusable airplane-like first stage vehicle called th e mass injection pre-compressor cooling (MIPPC) powered vehicle (MPV) and a second and third stage expendable rocket vehicle (ERV). The RASCAL demonstration objective was to place satellites and commodi ty payloads, between 50 and 130 kilograms in weight, into low earth orbit at any time, with a launch cost of less than $20,000 per kilogram. While the cost goal was commensurate with current large payload launch systems, it was estimated that the operational system, through producti on economies of scale, would have been more than a factor of three less than current capabilities for the dedicated micro payload size. Such a capability could enable cost effective use of on-orbit replacement and re-suppl y and provide a means for rapid launch of orbital assets for chan ging national security needs.

The FY 1990 Appropriation Act provided funds for the crea tion of HAARP, jointly managed by the Air Force Research Laboratory and the Office of Naval Research to exploit emerging ionosphere and high power radio technology for new military systems applications. Key to the curr ent effort is the expansion of the experimental research facility that includes a 3.6 MW high-frequency transmitter and a variety of diagnostic i nstruments, to conduct investigations to characterize the physical processes that can be initiated a nd controlled in the ionosphere and space, via interactions with high power radio waves. Among these are: (1) the generation of extremely low frequency/very low frequency radio waves for subm arine and other subsurface communication, and the reduc tion of charged particle populations in the radiation belts to ensure safe spacecr aft systems operations; (2) the control of electron density gradients and th e refractive properties in selected regions of the ionosphere t o create radio wave propagation channels; and (3) the generation of optical and infrared emissions in space to calibrate space sensors. To date, t he facility has been developed to include a suite of optical and radio diagnostics and an advanced, modern, high fre quency transmitting array that h as a radiated power of 960 kW, about one-third of the 3.6MW called for in the orig inal concept and plan. The current high frequency transmitting a rray has proven to be extremely reliable and flexible, and has shown the feasibility of the overall concept. However, results to date indicate th at advanced applications-related research activities and new military system concept demonstrations envisione d under the program require th at the high frequency transmitting capability at the site be increased from the present 960 kW level to the originally planned 3.6 MW level . A recent study completed by an Air Force/Navy Panel also points to additional hi gh-value functions that can po tentially be accomplished with t he a 3.6 MW 253UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2005 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Space Programs and Technology PE 0603287E, R-1 # 33 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 33 Page 10 of 22 capability, in particular, the exploration and refinement of scien tific principles that could lead to the development and deplo yment of a system to provide protection for space-based assets from emergent asymmetric th reats.

The effects of High Altitude Nuclear Detonations (HAND) are catas trophic to satellites. HAND-generated charged particles are t rapped for very long periods of time, oscillating between th e earth's north and south magnetic poles. This enhanced radiation environment woul d immediately degrade low earth orbiting (LEO) spacecraft capability and result in their destruction in a short period of time. The Sleight of HAND (SOH) program is a proof of concept demonstrati on of the technology and techniques to mitigat e the HAND-enhanced trapped radiation. The goal of SOH is to accelerate the rate of decay of trapped radiation from the LEO environment by a factor of 10 over the natural rate of dec ay. In Phase 1, SOH will use a high power ground-based source of very low frequency (V LF) radiation propagating throu gh the ionosphere to deflect t he trapped radiation deep into the atmosphere. If the ground-based proof of concept shows VLF radiation remediation concepts are valid an d cost-effective, a space-based demonstration that may lead to an operational capability will be pursu ed. If successful, follow-on operational pro grams to perform HAND produced radiation remediation will be pursued by the Air Force.

Currently optical ne tworks use photonics to transport data and electronics to process data. However, as the underlying bit rates of the optical networks are pushed beyond 40 giga-bits per s econd, there will be significant processing bottlenecks in these ne tworks and these bottlenecks will severely limit the military's ability to rapidl y transport time critical information. A potential solution to this problem is to deve lop photonic technology so optics can take over higher order netwo rk processing functions. This program will develop and demonstrate four key photonic technologies to meet these challenges: all-optical rout ing, all-optical data buffering (controllable and eventually random access,), optical logic circuits, a nd all-optical (multi-wavelength) regenera tors. These photonic technologies will lead to intelligent all-optical networks. The program will have two major areas of interest: The first will focus on developing new photonic technology that is essential if photonics is to play a significant role in higher order processing in optical netw orks. The second area will focus on developing novel architectures that will fully expl oit the new photonic technology to bring new and increased fun ctionalities to the optical networks.

Narrative Title FY 2004 FY 2005 2007 Urban Commander 2.415 15.200 14.025 11.727 (U) The Urban Commander thrust will develop automated tools to help ground commanders construct deta iled, realistic operational pla ns, particularly in nontraditional and urban e nvironments. Partial plans will be represente d in hierarchical task networks and vis ualized through synchronization matrices, icon overlays, or tactical sketch anim ations. Commanders and staff will modify, refine, and extend a plan through voice, sketching, and semi-structured input. The system links fragments constructed at different sites, transfers information among related parts, and discovers and recommends solutions for inconsistencies. The system continuously compiles a set of plan cases and employs a nalogical matching to propose extensions to current plans suggested by past experience. Plan elements are communicated through an integr ated set of protocols from the unit commander down to dismount commanders equippe d with advanced heads-up disp lays and helmet-worn sensors. Finally, the program will continuously assess progress against the opera tional plan and alert users to significant deviations. The Urban Commander program is developing planning and contro l tools tailored to dismounted operations in complex urban environments. Urban warfare combines limited sightlines and mo bility with insufficient knowledge of the disposition of enemy combatants, civilians, and the structures occupied. Urban Command er will form a command and control substrate that enables gro und forces, including vehicles and dismounts, to rapidly coordinate actions as the situation and comm anders knowledge of the situat ion 315UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2005 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Command, Control and Communications Systems PE 0603760E, Project CCC-01 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 46 Page 8 of 30 change. The program includes: 1) spatial analysis to determine lines of sight and fields of fire; 2) planning aids to assist i n sensor placement and route planning; 3) visualiza tion tools to allow commanders and soldiers to rapidly apprehend and address a situat ion; and 4) analysis tools to suggest locations and types of potential threats. The Multi-spectral Adaptive Networked Tactical Imaging System (M ANTIS) program is developing, in tegrating, and demonstrating a soldier-worn visualization system. The system consists of five elements: 1) helmet-mounted, multi-spectral sensor suite; 2) h iner tial unit and p ower supply. MANTIS provides the warfighter with digitally-fused im agery in real time from the multi-spectral sensor suite, exploit ing the signatures of imagery in three spectral bands: 1) the Visible/Ne ar Infrared (VNIR, .4 - .9 micr ons); 2) the Short Wave Infrare d (SWIR, 1 - 2 microns); and 3) the Long Wave Infrared (LWIR, 8 - 12 microns ). MANTIS will regain the nighttime advantage for the individua l warfighter in terms of mobility, situational awareness, and targe ting. The system will also allow the warfighters to record an d \"play back\" the video while on the battlefield. The r ecord/playback feature includes: electroni c zoom, scroll, pan and panoramic image st itching. In total, these technologies will furnish a larger field-of-view to e nhance context. MANTIS will provide a vision-aided inertial navigation system (INS) and will interface with the future soldier's global positioning system (GPS). When combined with precise pose est imation from the helmet-mounted IMU, MANTIS will allow battlefield informa tion to be overlaid on the display to provide augmented reali ty and increased situational awareness. MANTIS will interface with the fu ture soldier's advanced communications systems, allowing the warfighter to send/receive video images and position information with fellow soldiers and commanders in real time. MANTIS will also allow the soldier to receive images and information from remote se nsors. The coupling of the imaging system with INS/GPS will provide the individual warfighter a \"point-click-kill\" capability for real -time target hand-off capability to networked smart weapons f ired from remote locations, thereby significantly increasing the lethality of the individual warfighter. The MANTIS technology is planne d for transition to the Army at the conclusion of Ph ase III anticipated to be completed by FY 2006.

Active Templates are distributed applica tions whose variables were linked to live data feeds and exter nal problem- solving algorithms. AcT helped automate planning and execution by capturing, suggesting, and updating critical information, su ch as current state, goals, constraints, alternative acti ons, standard defaults, decisions in contex t and rationale. Active Templates were d esigned to be easily tailored, networked, noise-tolerant, user-s upported, scalable, and widely adopted. Ac T enabled special operations planners to create plans six times faster, improved plan quality by considering up to eight times more options, reduced staff-hours required to track and co ordinate missions by 60 percent, and enhanced capture of less ons learned. This technology promises significantly improved national capability to re spond in a crisis. Early prototypes of AcT technologies have been adopted and used by Special Operations Command (SOCOM), including use during Ope ration Enduring Freedom. There, they reduced plan development time by a factor of four and reduced personnel required for battle trac king by a factor of six. DARPA is working closely with th e Joint Special Operations Command to deve lop temporal and spatial planning applicatio ns and simple forms-based coordination tools that may be de fined dynamically by ordinary users in l ess than a day.

Ne w means of conducting secure communications ar e needed because th e commercial availab ility of high performance RF components makes the basic tools necessary for conducting signals intellig ence (SIGINT) exploitation available t o our adversaries. It is realistic to assume that adversaries will soon have the capability and means to develop software exploitati on techniques that make even the most advanced U.

To defeat this threat, the technical goal is to identify approaches to eliminate repeatability in transmissions by adapting the waveform randomly and forci ng random network routing. (U) The goal of the Polarized Rotation Modulation (PRZM) Communications program is to develop new ex tremely high data rate, point-t o- point, and wireless communications using the PZRM communications c oncept which can be implemented at any wavelength - RF to vis ible - to exploit the presently unused polarization and rotation dimensions of radiation. The PRZM communications program will investiga te the use of polarization modulation and the ability for conventional radios to carry all inform ation over the transmitted signal amplitude, phase and frequency. Polarization modulation introduces an additional dimension. A ra dio with four polarization possibilities would transmit four t imes the information with all other aspects of the waveform held constant. Use of the antenna as part of the information processing architecture of a radio has not been previously performed. This technology will greatly increase the capability of existing channels without increase in spectrum o r modem complexity. The program will be demonstrated as an enhancement to an otherwise state of the art networking system.

The Connectionless Networking (CN) program will develop technology to allo w networks (such as UGS) to se nd and receive messages without initial link acquisition or previous sharin g of routing information. This will, in turn, improve ener gy per bit of delivered information by as much as 100 to 1,000 times compared to conventi onal and near-term deployable communications systems such as c ontemplated by both commercial and military users. Conventional radio link and network designs expend most of the energy on link establish ment and maintenance, as well as packet and networ k overhead. This energy requirement not only limits the lifetime of energy-limited sy stems, it unnecessarily fills the radio spectrum, limiting available bandwid th, creates unnecessary risks of detection, and increases the rmal loads. These impacts are especially severe for communicati ons with proliferated sensors, or remotely operated or updated weapons. Eliminati ng the requirement to maintain a continuous netw ork linkage would enable these platforms to provide continuous connectivity without co nsumption of power, or compromising emanations. The CN program will expl oit current signal processing components, intelligent (processing a nd memory intensive) routing, and availability of situational informati on to demonstrate a total energy savings of at least 100 times typ ical connection oriented network applications. The Connectionless Networking technology is planned for transition to the Army, Navy, and Air Force for Unattended Ground Sensors and low duty cycle in FY 2007.

U.S. Forces face unique spectrum access issues in each country in which they op erate, due to competing civilian or government users of national spectrum. Th ese constraints must be reflected in all force planning and may preclude operation of critical systems. Coalition and allied operations ar e even more complex to manage, and may severely limit the U.S . ability to fully exploit its superiority and investment in information technology. The XG program approach is to develop the theoretical underp innings for dynamic control of the spectrum, the technologies and subsystems that enable reallocation of the spectrum, and the system proto types to demonstrate applicability to legacy and future DoD radio frequenc y emitters. The approach plans to investigate methods to leve rage the technology base in microelectronics with new waveform and medium access and control protocol technologies to construct an integ rated system. The proposed program goals are to develop, integrate, and evalua te the technology to enable equipment to automatically select s pectrum and operating modes to both minimize disruption of existing users, and to ensure operation of U.S. systems. The result of the XG p rogram will be to develop and demonstrate a set of standard dynamic spectrum ad aptation technologies for legacy and future emitter systems for jo int service utility. The XG Comms technology is planned for transition to the Army in th e Joint Tactical Radio Systems clusters and is anticipated t o be complete in FY 2007.

Su ch a reduction will significantly decrease th e probability of detection of transmitted signals and will also decrease the requi red transmit energy, thereby increasing battery lifetime. The program will pursue two novel approaches toward achieving its goal. One approach builds upon multiple noise-im mune sensors that have been combined with traditional coding algorithms to achieve significant improvements in intelligibility and quality in harsh noise environments at 2400 bps. This approach will be extended to no ntraditional ultra-low-bit-rate coding algorithms in order to achieve 300 bps coding capability in harsh military environments. An alternative approach explores the possibility of communication wit hout acoustic information by extracting lar yngeal and sublingual muscle signals that are produced when a person genera tes subvocal speech. This approach will yield a revolutionary capability in situations where stealth is of the utmost importance, or in situations where acoustic signals cannot be used, such as under wat er. The Advanced Speech Encoding technology is planned for transition to th e Army and is anticipated to be completed by FY 2008. (U) Program Plans: Demonstrated significant improvement in intelligibility a nd quality in harsh noise environments at 2400 bps.

This effort seeks to create a s ystem control methodology that will allow intuitive control over complex comm unications systems while still preserving the flexibility of the emerging ad-hoc networks. In addition to creating a method for an operator to un derstand the state of the network, PBNM will allow the network to implement the commander's intent for the operation by dynamically changing func tion and allocation throughout the duration of a mission.

Until recently, the pr imary technological emphasis has been oriented towards improv ing Command, Control, Communications and Computing, Intelligence, Surveillan ce and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems to enable better sensor-de cider-shooter linkages. To be more effective in joint operations, network cen tricity development must receive equal priority to facilitate b attlefield understanding to the commanders at all echelons, in a form b est suited for their information assimilation (receptive) and decis ion processes (intuitive). In other words, network centricity must improve th e art of battle command, rather than just the science of C4ISR, to be a force multiplier. This new initiative will develop and demonstrate the enabling technologies for Network Centric Operations, with em phasis on creating understanding for battle command. It will seamlessly connect the Network Centric Enterprise and Network Centric Warfare layers through understanding, thereby enabling shared awareness, collaboration and self-synchronization among the various joint components and echelons. This program integrates technologies enabling secure, assured, multi-su bscriber, multi-purpose (e.g., maneuver, logistics, intellige nce) networks with commander-centric command and control/intelligence technologies, in cluding forecasting/prediction of Courses of Action (COA) an d sustainment tools, into one unified joint battle command system. It will allow the Strategic/Operational Commanders to simultaneously orch estrate and coordinate the deployment, combat operati ons and resourcing of multiple UAs supported by multi-service, interagency, multinatio nal and nongovernmental activities. It will also s upport long range indirect fire support and effects, persistent theater Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (ISR), and continuous sustainment. For example, r esults of this program could help the Army produce within 30 m inutes, with a quality equivalent to what could be produced by a staff of sen ior planners with no time limit, (1) Running start insertion plan for multiple UAs; (2) transition plan for 3 UAs to maintain tempo in multiple battles; and (3) Operational maneuver of a UA by strategic air lift. F uture capabilities include, but are not limited to: Network Centric Operations, incl uding Enterprise and Warfare la yers; synergistic battle comman d among all joint components and echelons; networked manned a nd unmanned systems; cognitive systems; and robust, secure self-forming tactical net works seamlessly connected to the Global Information Grid (GIG). Initial technologies developed in the program will transition to th e Army Unit of Employment and the U.S. Joint Forces Command as a basal capabilit y in FY 2006, with more comprehensive capabilities ng in FY and FY 2009. 329UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2005 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Command, Control and Communications Systems PE 0603760E, Project CCC-02 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 46 Page 22 of 30 (U) Program Plans: Develop and demonstrate a single common architecture and commo n technology building blocks for seamlessly integrating the Strategic, Operational and T actical levels of warfare.

Narrative Title FY 2004 FY 2005 FY Advanced 0.000 (U) The Adaptive Amplification to Enable Electri cally Small Antennas effort (formerly know n as the Micro-Aperture Circuit effort) w ill develop and implement advanced circuit theo ry (non-Foster matching) that will enable electrically short antennas to be used wit h similar effectiveness to larger ones, and to dyna mically match antennas throughout a wide range of frequencies. Current antenna techno logy limits the ability to miniaturize the physical size of the antenna, resulting in a requirement for large platforms or physical deployments for frequencies (High Frequency) very suitable for special operations. Similarly, li mited antenna bandwidth limits the ability to fully exploit soft ware-based radios, such as Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS), since the antennas they u tilize are limited in bandwidth. Application of advanced techn ology (wide-band gap materials) offers the ability to fabricate devices that can e ffectively couple to very non-res onant antennas. In this prog ram DARPA will develop the basic technology, and then apply it to develop radios with wide bands of operation and very small physical size.

A potential application will be a self-contained cell phone size device that can use High Frequency (HF) to commu nicate around the world without any infrastructure. The Adaptive Amplification to Enable Electrically Small Antennas technology is planned for transition to the Army (primary), Navy and Air Force (secondary) in FY 2009. (U) The Ultra-Fast Radar effort will entail the design, construction, and demonstration of an X-band noise correlating radar with a retro- directive antenna. This effort will research and develop a new type of radar sensor based on the correlations of the Gaussian noise received by an antenna array from a small object located in the far field of th e antennas and the retro-directive re-radiation of the correlat ed noise by interconnecting the receive elements to transmit elements in a c onjugate (\"van-Atta\") fashion. The idea is the combining and t ailoring of noise- correlating (RNC) radar. The combinat ion of these innovations allows the radar to operate in omni-directional search mode by broadcasting white noise over a specified search ang le determined by the beam pattern of the individual elements. Once a target of ad equate cross section enters the beam within the range of the s ensor, correlations appear in the noise between neighboring antennas. The received noise power is then amplified by the transceiver electronic cha in and re- transmitted directly towards the target in a process call the RNC feedback loop. The result of this project will be a new type of search-mode radar having promising performance in terms of s hort acquisition time and low probability-of-intercept. The Ultra Fast Radar technol ogy is planned for transition to the Army in FY 2007.

This effo rt will pursue opto-electronic integration of state-of-the art radio frequency (R F) and digital photonics, RF and digital integrated circuits and micro-electro- mechanics (MEMS) technologies for embedded aerospace applications . The photonics technology from this effort will result in th e development of a common optical backbone in place of ma ny point-to-point links. The DARPA porti on of the Navy Photonics Program will addre ss high-risk development areas including reduction of fiber optic device size. As a result, this size reduction will enable placement of co mponents in currently inaccessible locations (i.e., beyond the wing-fold).

Narrative Title FY 2004 0.000 work previously reported under PE 0602702E, Tactical Technol ogy to rapidly develop and demonstrate affordable and reliable acoustic gun shot de tection and localization techniques. This program focused on enhancing the safety of vehicle convoys and increasing situational awareness. Based on previous acoustic shot det ection work, this program de veloped system hardware d esign and packaging, vehicle integration concepts, user interfaces and si gnal processing algorithms and software for prototype systems, a s well as continued refinement of algorithms, hardware and soft ware to improve system performance and accuracy. Acoustic sensors, mounted in an ar ray at the top of a mast, are used to detect both supersonic shock and sound waves from muzzle blast and then identify the location of the sho oter. Users receive simultaneous visual and auditory information about the point of fire from an LED display and speaker. Boomerang systems are be ing tested by warfighters serving in Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and are providing force protection capabilities for moving vehicles and st ationary sites. The systems were designed for ease of use, installation and field upgr adeability. Shot data collected from a series of CONUS firin g tests and from systems deployed to OIF demonstrated that Boomerang provides troops the ability to detect and locate supersonic shots for both stationary and moving targets. Comments from deployed troops continue to be coll ected and analyzed. As a result, an improved version of the Boomerang system with significantly smaller acoustic arrays (designed to redu ce visual footprint) is being de veloped with enhanced crew d isplay, increased detection range, ability to provide shooter's elevation, and impr oved electro-magnetic interference thresholds so as not to int erfere with tactical combat radios used by Marine and Army units. 342UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2005 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Land Warfare Technology PE 0603764E, Project LNW-01 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 49 Page 5 of 22 (U) Program Plans: Improve performance based on data from deployed systems, user feedback and evolving concepts of operations.

The FCS program em braces an evolutionary acquisition, spiral development process. The first FCS SoS Unit of Action (UA), equipped with the eighteen (18) FCS Systems, plus the Netw ork, will be initially fielded in 2014. The program allows for continuous capability upgrades through the introduction of new, enabling tech nologies throughout the development phase. This Joint DARPA/ Army activity supports the FCS spiral process through the development of critical technology improvements for FCS platform variants and the N etwork. The resulting network-centric SoS will continue to provide the Unit of Action overwhelming lethality, strategic deployability, self -sustainment, and high survivability over other conventional ground forces.

The FCS PerceptOR tech nology was integrated into the UGCV-PerceptOR Integration (UPI) program. (U) The Unmanned Ground Combat Vehicle (UGV) program developed vehi cle prototypes exhibiting advanced performance in endurance, obstacle negotiation, and transpor tability (small size) based on novel designs unrest rained by the need to accommodate human cr ews. These prototypes included unique mobility configura tions, exceptional drivetrains, advanced structures/composites, terrain/soil analy sis, sensory exploitation and interaction with robotic control architectures. The FCS UGSV technology was inte grated into the UGCV-PerceptO R Integration (UPI) program. (U) The UGCV-PerceptOR Integration (UPI) program will integrate aut onomous navigation algorithms with the Spinner platform to yield an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) that operates reliably in obstacle -rich terrain. Spinners will be used as platforms to port and test methods for perception techniques to optimize autonomous performance. This natural mating of the best-of-class sensors and algorithms on a vehicle of Spinner's class represents a leap forward in UGV capability. Autonomous mobility will be further enhanced by the use of terrai n data for path planning. The program's technologies will transfer to the FCS Ar med Robotic Vehicle (ARV) and Au tonomous Navigation System (AN S) programs through PM-UA, anticipated to occur in FY 2008. (U) The Future Combat Systems MultiCell and Dismounted Command a nd Control program enables experimentation with advanced command and control information technology. MultiCell emulates the functionality of an entire tactical combined arms force. T he program incorporates both unmanned air and ground robotic platforms, hea dquarters working at the operational level, and human dismounts . MultiCell also provides commanders with recommended interface functions a nd workload allocations. MultiCell validates the understanding of the dynamics of complex warfighting organizations thus defining comm ander interface layouts, functions and displays for maximum fle xibility and effectiveness. This program recommends capability enhancements supporting technol ogy for the nomination of information sources and supports visualization of current and future operational states. Mu ltiCell enables commanders to successf ully prosecute future command and control operations with significantly reduced staff.

To enable this functionalit y, development of new secure waveforms, di rectional antennas and mobile ad hoc netw orks will be initiated. The C2 component will directly leverage the Army's investment in th e automation of the Battlefield F unctional Areas within the Army Battle Command System (ABCS). Because of the multitude of single aspect systems that feed information in ABCS, large amounts o f data are made available to the commander, thus requiring a much larger sta ff of operators and workstation analysts to complete the fusio n function of battlefield data into information for the commander to make d ecisions. Future operations involving FCS technologies and operat ional capabilities cannot be restricted by a less responsive C2 architecture and large support staffs. DARPA establis hed an MOA with the Army for this program in July 2004. (U) Under the Maneuver C 3 program, the Mobile Networked Multiple-Input/Multip le-Output (MIMO) (MNM) project will pursue MIMO communication systems, which have the potential to increase data rates by 10-20 times above current systems. MIMO will use mul tipath to create parallel channels in the same frequency band thereby increasing spect ral efficiency. This effort will demonstrate the MNM capa bility under where conven tional techniques are degraded. This effort will unde rtake advanced MIMO technology development and perform field demonstrations of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). This effort will culminate in the development of a wideband form-factor (Joint Tactical Radio Syst em (JTRS) cluster 1 size PC card) system. The MNM technology is planned for transition to the Army, FCS Program at the conclusion of Phase II that is anticipated to be completed by FY 2007. (U) The Netfires program developed and tested a containerized, platform-independent multi-mission weapon concept as an enabling technology element for FCS. NetFires provides rapid response and lethality in packages requi ring significantly fewer personnel , decreased logistical support and lower life-cycle costs, while increasing su rvivability compared to current direct fire gun and missile a rtillery. NetFires will allow FCS to defeat all known threats, will be air deployable in C-130 (and smaller) aircraft, and will enhance the situation a wareness and survivability of FCS by providing standoff target acquisition and extended-range, non-line-of-sight engagements. The program d eveloped and demonstrated a highly flexible modular, multimission precision miss ile and a loitering attack missile that can be remotely comm anded. Both missile types have a self-locating launcher and a command and contro l system compatible with FCS. This program transitioned to the Army in March 2004.

Th e company level UAV will be developed under the OAV-II program and the platoon le vel UAV will be developed under the Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) pr ogram. (U) The Organic Air Vehicle - II program consists of 2 primary elemen ts: development of lift augmen ted ducted fan vertical flight vehicles together with their associated flight controls; and evaluati on and integration of supporting technologies including non-line-of -sight communications, heavy fuel engines, improved navigation and obst acle avoidance, and acoustic noise reduction. Once the basic f light vehicle is proven, these technologies will be integrated into the flight vehi cle and demonstrated in a simulated mission. The OAV-II prog ram will leverage several programs in DARPA and the services including advanced communications, sensor developments, the MAV ACTD, and UAV comman d and control programs. The dry system weight (no fuel) of the OAV II to be developed in FY 2005 will be no greater than 112 lbs . DARPA established an MOA with the Army for this program in December 2004. The program will transition to the Army at the end of Phas e III, which is anticipated to be in FY 2009. (U) The primary goal of the Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) program is to further develop and integrate MAV technologies into militarily useful and affordab le backpackable systems suitabl e for dismounted soldier, Mari ne, and Special Forces missions. It will focus on the development of lift augm ented ducted fan MAVs to accomp lish unique military missions, pa rticularly the hover and stare capability in restricted environments. The objectiv e of the MAV ACTD is to dem onstrate a backpackable, afforda ble, easy-to- operate, and responsive reconnaissance and surv eillance system. The system will provide the small unit with militarily useful real-time combat information of difficult to observe and/or distant areas or objects. The system will also be employable in a variety of warfig hting environments (for example: in complex topologies such as mountainous terrain; ur ban areas; confined spaces; and high concentrations of civil ians). The initial MAV technology development program focused on the technologies a nd components required to enable flight at small scales, includ ing flight control, power and propulsion, navigation and communications. Th e MAV ACTD program is intended to get DARPA-developed small, V TOL UAVs rapidly into the hands of the users for evaluation and evolut ion of the technologies; development of tactics, techniques a nd procedures; and to provide a residual operational capability to active duty forces. The FCS MAV technology is planned for transition to the Ar my during FY 2007. (U) The FCS LADAR Support (JIGSAW Phase III) program develops adva nced laser radar (LADAR) sensor systems and technologies. Jigsaw enables warfighters to accomplish day/night target identif ication and verification in stressing environments. Environme nts of interest include targets hidden by foliage and camouflage, and targets in urban settings, such as alleyways. Jigsaw technologies are de signed to provide 350UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2005 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Land Warfare Technology PE 0603764E, Project LNW-03 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 49 Page 13 of 22 warfighters with reliable combat identification; the LADAR sensor will deliver a visual picture of the target scene. DARPA est ablished an MOA with the Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate for this program in October 2004. The JIGSAW technology is planned fo r transition to the Army at the conclusion of Phase III that is anticipated to be completed by FY 2007. (U) The Foliage Penetration (FOPEN) Reconnaissance, Surv eillance, Tracking and Engagement Radar (FORESTER) initiative supports the Future Combat Systems (FCS) and the U.S. Army Objective Force. The program is de veloping FOPEN Ground Moving Target Indication (GMTI) radar. This radar promises persistent, long-term detec tion and tracking of enemy combat vehicles and dismounted troops moving in open and forested areas of the battlefield. The technology allows Ob jective Force commanders to opera te with confidence in forested areas. It also detects low-flying aircraft such as helicopters and ultra-lights. Its synthetic aperture rada r images support terrain delimita tion, road identification, and target tracking in wooded areas. FORESTER is a UHF-band FOPEN GMTI radar for deployment on rotary wing platforms such as t he A160 unmanned helicopter. The radar, operati ng from a hovering platform under calm wind c onditions, can achieve calm-weather detect ion ranges in excess of 30 kilometers against dismounted troops moving in fo rested areas. The program employs adaptive antenna processing an d innovative radar waveforms to overcome ra dio frequency interference and electronic counter measures in hostile electromagnetic environments . The FORESTER technology is planned for transition to the Army at th e conclusion of Phase III anticipated to be completed by FY 2008 . (U) The Affordable Adaptive Conformal Electronically Steerable Arra y Radar (AACER) program develops components and technologies for a helicopter-borne surveillance, targeting, and communications capability and integrates them into an airborne system suitable for use on the next generation Unmanned Airborne Vehicles such as A-160. The technol ogies being developed include: (1) Ka band Electronically Sca nned Antenna Arrays (ESA) which lend themselves to affordable manufacturi ng techniques; (2) underlying ESA devices such as phase shifting el ements and power amplifiers/combiners whic h operate at Ka band and are affordable yet su pport the requirements of a high performance radar system; (3) miniature receiver exciter modules capable of generating waveforms for high performance MTI and SAR radar, for communications f unctions including combat identification, and for growth to higher perfo rmance and additional functions in radar and electronic warfare; (4) very high performance, small size and low cost sign al processors to support high resolution ra dar surveillance and tracking functions, ta rget imaging and geolocation, and communications functions; (5) signal processing al gorithms to optimally exploit the inherent capability of the ESA to support multiple functions simultaneously, each with state-of-the-art ope rational performance; and (6) integration of all technical ele ments into a functional system that meets UAV platform constraints, is suita ble for flight demonstration on manned and unmanned vehicles, an d provides a concrete basis for demonstrating the affo rdability of production units. If successful, this program will provide a vastly impr oved intelligence and targeting capability for local commanders by providing a dedicated , rapidly taskable asset with the capability to maintain surv eillance of a large 351UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2005 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Land Warfare Technology PE 0603764E, Project LNW-03 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 49 Page 14 of 22 region of their battlespace, including areas inaccessible or obscure d to larger airborne assets. DARPA established an MOA with the Army for this program in January 2005. The AACER tec hnology is planned for transition to the PEO -IEW at the conclusion of Phase III, anticip ated to be completed by FY 2008. (U) The Affordable Weapon System Long Gun program will evaluate and develop a re-useable, long endurance, low cost, joint, unmanned/armed missile system combined with a tri-mode long wave infrared/near infrared/visible (LWIR/NIR/VIS) sensor with lase r spot targeting. Ducted fan propulsion will pr ovide efficient thrust for long endurance. The missile will be launched from a canist er carried on a sea or ground vehicle, will fly to a specified target area, and use a tri-mode sensor operating at visi ble, long, and near-infrared wa velengths to search for targets. If a qualified target is found, the missile will attack the target with a self-contained munition. If no targets are found, the missile could be commanded to return to base. The missile will include a data li nk back to a human controller/operator to confirm target charac teristics, approve engagement, and perform battle damage assess ment. Beginning in FY 2005, the program is funded under PE 0603286E, Project AIR-0 1. (U) The electro-magnetic (EM) Mortar program w ill design and demonstrate EM guns (coilgun and railgun) cap able of firing modified 1 20 mm mortar rounds to 420 m/s. The second goal is to evaluate significant system \"trade space issues\" for implementation includi ng: 1) ammunition integration and compatibility; 2) vehicle integration concerns; 3) system reliabilit y metrics (barrel life, EM interference); 4) lethality change due to modification; and 5) system supportability metrics. Trans ition of operational capability will be accomplished through the A rmy FCS program, and is anticipated to occur in FY 2007. (U) The DP-5X program will provide a flight-ready, tactically transp ortable, vertical take-off and landing unmanned air vehicle (VT OL UAV) to integrate with a gimbaled payload for technology demonstrati on of the JIGSAW sensor package. The UAV will be employable by a two person team and deployable in a single HMMWV. It will provide lift for a 75 lb payload with 6 hours endurance, 100 kts cruising speed , with nap of the earth agility. Multi-mission capability and modularity will allow th e DP-5X to rapidly integrate additional payloads for sensi ng, communications, and target effects. The DP-5X program is pl anned for transition to the Army in FY 2007. (U) The Future Combat Systems Studies, Analysis and Experimentation Project enables the continued Joint analysis and integration of enabling future land warfare concepts and technologies into the U.S. Army Future Combat System program. It enables the rapid a nalysis of opportunistic concepts and technologies, a nd provides support for Joint Force effectiveness modeling of DARPA enabling technolo gies by the 352UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2005 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Land Warfare Technology PE 0603764E, Project LNW-03 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 49 Page 15 of 22 TRADOC \"Future's Center.\" The project has three initial focus ar eas: Air Assault Expeditionary Forces (AAEF), USMA Systems Eng ineering, and Directed Studies. (U) The objective of the FCS International Cooperation program is to establish a Science and Technology Project Agreement with Sing apore as well as supporting the conduct of FY 2004 Coalition Interoperability wargaming analys is with Singapore and the UK using the DARPA developed Joint Semi Automated Forces (JSA F) Simulation. The program is in collaboration with the Army. The Singapore Project agreement will initially support the Mechanized Air Assault, Unmanned Air Vehicles, Coalition Command and Control, and Multispectral Gogg les for Dismounted Infantrymen and Scouts. This program investigates th e development of novel quantum dot detector technology and appl ications to multi-spectral systems, concentrating on the visible to near in frared. The initial assessment of detector technology will incl ude the spectral sensitivity, quantum yield and temperature-dependant material para meters. These parameters will be related to the sensor requi rements, including new design concepts for unique micro-sensor s and goggle applications. DARPA established an MOA with the Army for this program in April 2004. The FCS International Cooperation technolog y is planned for transition to the Army by FY 2007. (U) The Sensor DART program will produce and de monstrate unattended ground sensors into an aerodynamic glider capable of covert delivery from a stand-off at least 45 km with a 50 m or less circ ular error probability (CEP). Se nsor DART will leverage and i ntegrate capabilities derived from the Hawkeye small UAV demonstrator and Steel Rattle r (hand emplaced) and Steel Eagle (F-15 air emplaced) projects. The basis for the Sensor Dart is a platform/sensor system that transiti ons from winged flight to earth-penetrating dart. The integration of glider and precision delivered sensor will provide a well-coupled seismic and acoustic sensing capability in support of the Unit of Action (UA). Th e transition customer will be UA Product Manager Robotic and Unmanned Sensors (PM RUS) out of Fort Monmouth. Transition will occur followin g program conclusion, after FY 2007. (U) The WolfPack program will further develop the initial capability for close approach electronic warfare. The overall effectiven ess and efficiency of FCS will be improved by this effort through the development of an advanced, collaborative electronic warfare sens ing and attack system. This will lead to improved situational awareness of the battlespace for other FCS platforms and will improve their sur vivability in a wide range of potential conflicts. The improved WolfPack system will be able to suppress enemy air defenses, RF communication syste ms, and networks either through sensing and passing b ack targeting information to other FCS wea pon platforms for kinetic fire or by col laboratively jamming those systems and networks on its own. The WolfPack technology is planned for transition to the Army by FY 2006. 353UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2005 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Land Warfare Technology PE 0603764E, Project LNW-03 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 49 Page 16 of 22 (U) Program Plans: PerceptOR -- Conducted perception system prototype developm ent testing in both laboratory and field. -- Conducted evaluation experiments on early perception system prot otypes in variety of terrain and environmental conditions. -- Conducted algorithm development for advanced perception behavior. -- Continued algorithm and supporting technology developments for unmanned maneuver. -- Updated prototype algorithms and hardware based on supporting experimentation. -- Explored system implications of degraded component perform ance (communications constraints, sensor and other faults).

It is imperative for the future of the U.S. forces to operate flawlessly with each other, regardless of which Services and systems are involved in any particular mission. The overarching goal of this program element is to enable technologies at all levels, regardless of Service component, to operate as one system. (U) The Joint Warfare Systems project will create enabling technology for seamless joint operations from high-level, strategic plan ning to low-level, tactical operations in all envi ronments: urban, suburban, and rural areas. The operational benefits of this project will be an enhanced ability to counter opponents' capabilities, not just facilities and e quipment. This project includes efforts at the strategic/ operational level that generates targeting options against opponents' centers of grav ity having complex networked re lationships, the operational/tacti cal level that manages highly automated forces with tight coupling between air and ground platforms, and the focu sed tactical level that devel ops targeting platforms that can acquire targets of opportunity cued by netw ork-based analysis of likely enemy operations.

Naval forces play an ever-increasing role in network centric warfare because of their forward deployed nature, their unique capab ility to operate simultaneously in the air, on the sea and under the sea and their v ersatile ability to provide both rapid strike and project sustained force. The technologies developed under this project will capitalize on these attributes, improve them and enable them to operate with othe r network centric forces.

Joint Warfare Systems levera ges current and emerging network, robotic, and information techn ology and provides next generation U.S. forces with greatly expanded capab ility, lethality, and rapid responsiveness. Critical issues fa cing this project are: (1) U.S. opponents utilizing systems that are flexible, robust, and difficult to neutralize; and (2) U.S. doctrine that limits the use of firepower to lessen the impact of operations on noncombatants. These problems are magnified in urban and semi-urban areas where combatants and civilians are often colocated, and in peacekeeping operations where combatan ts and civilians are often indistinguishable. Meeting these challenges places a heavy burden on joint war planning. Unders tanding opponent networks is essential so th at creative options can be developed to counter their strategies. Synchronization of air and ground operations to apply force only where needed and with specific effects is require d. This project supports all levels of the force structure including: (1) the strategic/operational level by ge nerating targeting options agai nst opponents' centers of gravity that have complex networked relationships; (2) the tac tical/operational level by managi ng highly automated forces with tight coupling between air and ground platforms; and (3) the focused tactical level by developing platforms, which acquire targets of opportun ity, cuing network-based analysis of likely enemy ope rations and developing warfighter tools, t hus maximizing the presence of ground force s in Stability and Support Operational (SASO) environments.

The program allows commanders and their staffs to share situ ation information, develop coor dinated battle plans, generate and compare alternate courses of action, a nd assess likely outcomes, without conventional group briefings. Net work Command builds on the paradigm established by the Command Post of the Fu ture program, which demonstrated to commanders, working with vo ice-over IP and robust graphical collaboration software , a coherent understanding of a situation and operational plan without any face-to-f ace interactions. Command Post of the Future (CPOF) is curren tly deployed with multiple Army Divisions in support of Operations Iraqi Freedom (OI F). CPOF is scheduled to transition to the Ar my Program Executive Office Command, Control, and Communications Tactical (PEO C3T) in April 2006. This program created a system with radical ne w capabilities for improving decision making by operational commander s, providing dynamic tailored visualization a nd deep collaboration tools for improved s ituation awareness and course-of-action dev elopment and dissemination. The program will introduce a radical new conc ept for future command environments, namely, the elimination o f the fixed command post that will be replaced by battle command on th e move. Introduction of the tool s developed under this program will allow future command structures to be mobile and distributed, thus enabling reduction of staff sizes and allowing commanders to operate effectively while on the move. The Multiuser, Adaptive Command Environment (MACE) program is an outgrowth of the Command Post of the Future (CPOF) program that will make collaborative tactical command more adaptive, cro ss-functional, and scalable. The program provides monitors in the collaboration environment to observe data tr affic, identify patterns, and proactively m ove information through the system to mo re rapidly meet user's needs. MACE allows users to be distinguished by their military functi on - intelligence, maneuver, fires, security, logistics - and tailors displays and communication mode s to those functions. Finally, the technology scales the environment from dozens to hundreds of workstations operating over a dive rse set of tactical communication networks. 364UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2005 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Network-Centric Warfare Technology PE 0603766E, Project NET-01 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 51 Page 5 of 22 The Network-Centric Situation Assessment pr ogram develops and deploys technologies to assess military situations at levels of i nterest above individual targets. The program uses all-source data to reconstruct unit organizations , mission relationships, logistics connections, and communications connectivity and analyzes data over time to infer movement, communicat ion, and supply patterns. Within this context, capability analyses are provided and future courses of action are hypothesized. The objective is to understand potent ial capabilities and intentions of opposing forces. This effort provides greater understanding of opponents' force structures, cap abilities, and operational practices, then enables commanders to sustain effects-based targeting rather than simple attrition strategies. The program provides a context for discovering vulnerabilities in opposing fo rces and provides cues for intellig ence, surveillance, and rec onnaissance planning, as it suggests areas of future en emy activity that merit intense scrutiny. The Joint Mission Rehearsal program integrates high-fidelity; ma inframe-based combat simulations with situation assessment and planning tools. The objective is to allow rehearsal of joint mi ssions, while participants are en route to operations or remain at their home stations. The program uses current situa tion data to: (1) provide initial conditions for the simulations, and (2) plan data t o steer the dynamics of the simulations along the selected courses of action. The technology streams data from the simulations for display , then visualization systems are available to the prospective participan ts. The visualization permits the warfighter to interact with the simulation in a manner consistent with their anticip ated role in the mission being rehearsed. The program delivers the capability to prac tice and fine- tune mission plans for joint military operations and enables co mmanders and staff to participate from their current location in stead of a training facility, thereby reducing deployment need s while improving mission planning and effectiveness.

Narrative Title FY 2004 FY 2005 FY 2006 FY Systems (PUCS) 0.000 4.000 10.423 22.565 (U) The Precision Urban Combat Systems (PUCS) is developing and va lidating advanced sensor, explo itation, networking, and battle management capabilities for joint dismounted fo rces in urban combat. The program in cludes detection and tracking of potential enemy targets, discrimination and identification of friendl y versus enemy units, sorting of enemy from neutral and non-combatant personnel, co ordination of sensing, maneuver, and fires, and contin uous assessment of results. PUCS will utilize technologies including: smart networks o f distributed imaging and non-imaging sensors; sensors with the capability to de tect hidden human targets; improved 3D visualization systems, multi-spectral discrimination systems that survey the battlefield for weapon activity and detect primary signatures. These capabilities will be developed within the framework of both legacy forces and exp ected future forces. The program will provi de a set of prototype demonstrations of the capabilities in surrogate urban combat environments. The Robust, Persistent 3D Urban RSTA (r econnaissance, surveillance and target acqui sition) program addresses the very difficult technical challenges to provide situatio nal awareness capabilities that will assist the warfighter in identifying and defeating enemy threats. This includes the ability to robustly detect and persistently track all-source targets in the highly cluttered, 3-dimensional u rban landscape (outdoors and indoors). This program will demonstrate an i nnovative active radio frequency (RF) sensor network technology that uses broadband, short-pulse active RF technologies for low power precis ion radar and communications, e xploits multi-static operation for robust 3-D target detection, localization and tracking, and pr ovides distributed sensor fusion for target characterization. 366UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2005 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Network-Centric Warfare Technology PE 0603766E, Project NET-01 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 51 Page 7 of 22 The Firefight Aerial Sensor and Mapper pr ogram will develop a new adaptive optical-ac oustic sensor fusion system to identify th e 3D dynamic locations of red and blue forces in continually updated 3D mode ls of the urban landscape. The program will use a small number of UAVs (1-4) equipped with multi-modal sensor suites (IR, acoustic a rrays) and rapidly updated 3D im agery. By detecting weapo n discharge events, approximations of individua l shooter locations are combined in orde r to obtain an informative overall picture of the emerging battlefield. The Smart Dust Sensor Networks Applied to Urban Area Operations Program will provide persistent staring reconnaissance, surveil lance, and target acquisition (RSTA) of the three- dimensional urban battlespace using a dense ne twork of ground sensors. The system c oncept consists of ubiquitous and inconspicuous low-power, small and easily conceal ed ground sensors throughout the urban landscape. The program includes the development of ultra small sensor nodes for e asy deployment and concealment in a crowded urban environment and data fusion algorithms to exploit the abundance of new information provided by a dense urban spatial network. The Head Mounted Alerting for Urban Operations program will provide unprecedented situation awareness capabilities to the warfi ghter without flooding the individual with excess information. The prog ram will develop an intrusive alerting system that will allow a soldier to patrol and/or operate in an urban envir onment while being interrupted only by urgent and highly relevant situation awareness in formation. The program will employ an information management engine that filters, prioritizes, and presents diverse and copious amounts of situation awareness data, generically referred to as 'alerts', in accordance with a set of corre lation rules created by each in dividual soldier. The filtering will be specialized to individual warfighter's ro les and responsibilities and automated so the warfighter does no t have to make real-time complicated adjustments to th eir tools when a dangerous situation erupts. The Exploiting Vibrations to Monitor Activities in Buildings pr ogram will develop procedures and sensors to characterize activi ty inside structures based on acoustic/seismic information. The types of information sought include numbe r and location of personnel, fo ot traffic, operation of building mechanicals (ventilation, cooling, and hea ting; plumbing; etc.) as an indicator of human activity, operat ion of other machinery, door openings and closings, and speech. Algorithms th at infer internal layout of the building from the pattern and location of these activities will be investigated along w ith the fusing of the information from othe r surveillance information gained by ot her sensing modalities. 367UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2005 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Network-Centric Warfare Technology PE 0603766E, Project NET-01 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 51 Page 8 of 22 (U) Program Plans: Robust, Persistent 3D Urban RSTA. -- Collect Ultra-wide band target and background signatures. -- Develop and demonstrate technologies to separate targets from background. -- Test at a representative Military Operat ions on Urban Terrain (MOUT) site.

These techniques use all-source info rmation to continuously update models of urban networks (e. g., transportation, energy). An aim is to elicit operational objec tives for urban interventions, expressed in terms of desired and undesired effects. The technology will use these objectives to find vu lnerabilities in the networks, then nomi nating targets for prosecution so as to maximize desired effects while minimizing undesired effects. Further, the program develops techniques for predicting those observables that wil l rapidly identify an opponent's response when several courses of action are available.

Improvements in communications between and amo ng submarines, surface ships and naval aircraft have allowed these forces to opera te seamlessly with each other and with other Service's netwo rk centric systems. Naval forces will play an ever increasing role in network centric warfare because of their forward deployed nature, their uniqu e capability to operate simultaneously in the air, on the sea and under the sea a nd their versatile ability to provide both rapid strike and pr oject sustained force. The technologies developed under this project will capitalize on th ese attributes, improve them and enable them to operate with other network centric forces. This project funds the Mobile Undersea Distribut ed System (MUDS) program, the Jet Blast Deflector program, the Non Linear Dynamics for Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), and the Reduced Si ze, Affordable Submarines technology demonstration program.

Using covert, mobile, and ener gy-efficient vehicles, the tactical gain available from the collective intelligence behavior of a sw arm of individual agents will be demonst rated. This effort will develop technologies in the areas of agent-based autonomous cont rol; vehicle navigation; high data rate/low-power underwater co mmunications; network management and optimization; sustainable energy con cepts; and low power sensing/signal processing enabling covert persi stent underwater surveillance in denied areas. The military utility of underwater gliders will be dem onstrated in a sensor system th at is configurable in 3D, adaptable to the physical environment for sensing and comm unications, sustainable by getting its on-station locomotion and 'staying power' from the environment, self-configurable using sensory feedback, and self-optimizing using efficien t dynamic network management techniques. (U) The Persistent Ocean Surveillance effort will combine geoloca tion techniques such as the global positioning system with station keeping and intra-sensor communication technologies to provide long-term station keeping ocean environment sensing buoys. These techno logies when applied with state-of-the-art undersea warfa re sensors will result in a floating field of smart sensors capable of observing th e undersea environment in an area, including the presence of submarines and other undersea vehicles. A range of technologies will be considered inclu ding those that rely on the local environment (such as wind, solar energy, temperature differentials, etc.) for their power, miniature geolocation t echnologies, and technologies for sensor data storage, transmission, and intra-fi eld communications. The Persiste nt Ocean Surveillance-Station Keeping technology is planned for transition to the Navy is anticipated in FY 2008.

This information is critical for rout e planning, sensor placement, rendezvous determination, vulnerabi lity assessments, and for determining objective assault engagement/disengagement stra tegies. For uncharted and/or denied areas, present methods are inadequate for obtaining the necessary information. Reliable remote sensing methods do not exist that produ ce bathymetry and water curren t data in waters that are sediment laden (bottom is not visible) and/or shelte red (swell and significant wind waves are not likely). The River Eye effort will provide a new capability to predict or assess, in real time, river and estuary conditions to enable special operations mission planning and execution. New techniques will be developed to indirectly determine current by remotely-sensing advection of scen e features. Using advanced m odeling techniques indirectly sensed current data will be used to extract bathymetry data. Forward circ ulation models will use the bat hymetry data to predict future currents and water heights in a mission planning decision support tool.

Although this effort is focused on projects that are driven by projected submarine requirements, it is recognized that several of these developments will have applicability to multiple Navy platforms that share similar inhe rent infrastructure (e.g., hydraulics, torpedo handling/launch, and sonar). This program will be a collaborative effort to overcome selected tec hnological barriers that are judged to have a significant impact on submarine platform infrastructure cost. DARPA and the Navy, under Memorandum of Agreement in September 2004, will jointly formulate tech nical objectives for critical technology demonstrations in: (1) propulsi on concepts not constrained by a centerline shaft, (2) extern ally stowed and launched weapons (especially torpedoes), (3 ) conformal alternatives to the existing spherical sonar array, (4) technologies tha t eliminate or substantially simplify existing submarine hull, mechanical and elec trical systems, and (5) automation to reduce crew workload f or standard tasks.

Narrative Title FY 2004 FY 2005 FY 2006 FY 2007 Network Centric Sensing and Engagement (29.891) 28.144 39.683 43.843 (U) The Network Centric Sensing and Engagement Program develops technology and tools to support precise situational awareness, rapi d targeting, and precision engagement through the exploitation of systems of networke d sensors. Network-centric sensing acknowle dges a group of sensors as a system and leverages networked intercommunication to enable system perform ance superior to that of uncoordinated i ndividual sensors. Applications include advanced ta rget detection, acquisition, tracking, and combat identification. The technology is suited to ground - based fixed and mobile sensors and airborne multi-ship sensor sy stems. Exploiting the potential of network-centric sensing req uires a number of approaches. Required technology advances include: sensor-to-sen sor communications, multi-sensor management, sensor system geo registration, real-time data fusion, advanced tracking, and network-centric sensor operational modes. Initiatives in this program include th e following: The Camouflaged Long Endurance Nano-Sensors (C LENS) initiative develops low-cost, lightweight micro-sensors to detect, geolocat e, track, and classify targets in difficult environments. The syst em leverages ultra-wideband radio technologies developed for ad vanced communications. The combination of active, coherent, distri buted-network sensing offers unique capabilities not possible from stand- alone, single-point systems. CLENS enables reduced force protecti on and supports monitoring of borders and critical CONUS sites , and long-duration covert monitoring of target sites such as terrorist camps. CLENS has broad application in support of comprehensi ve intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissan ce for situational awareness and enables pe rsistent sensing of dismounted combatant s in forested areas and other tough environments . The CLENS technology is planned for transition to the SOCOM at the conclusion of Phase III anticipated to be completed by FY 2007. The Tactical Targeting Network Technologies (TTNT) initiative deve lops rapidly reconfigurable, a ffordable, robust, interoperabl e, and evolvable communications technologies. R esulting technologies support airborne network-centric targeting. Goals for the TTNT tactical network are: (1) reconfigurability in fractions of a second; (2) wideband capacity (10+Mbit/s) on demand; (3) near mil liseconds) 405UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2005 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Sensor Technology PE 0603767E, Project SEN-02 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 52 Page 24 of 34 latency for high priority messages; (4) comple te interoperability with Link 16; and (5) cost effectiveness. This program addre sses technical issues including physical waveforms and frequency alloca tions, fast security subsystems, and distributed network mana gement. It is developing novel digital processing techniques to eliminate the need for centralized network synchronization. TTNT is pu rsuing an omni-antenna-based approach with a self-ad aptive, channel-sensing, multiple user access protocol. It employs spread spectrum waveforms optimized for rapid carrier acquisition, featuring powe rful turbo code error detection and correction. This physical layer provides well-integrated security architecture. The network ar chitecture is designed to exploit commercial-off-the-shelf techn ology wherever possible. TTNT will incorporate Joint Tactical Radio Syst em software defined radio standa rds. Performance in simulat ions and laboratory testing with bread-board equipm ent exceeds the current phase program goals. TTNT is designing and fabricating a ful l security architecture brass-board system. The program separately devel oped a novel Ku band directional antenna. The antenna promises 20+Mbit/s connectivity between intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance assets, tactical aircraft, and small unmanned air vehicles using the Common Data Link family of radios . The TTNT technology is planned for trans ition to the Air Force, Army, Marine Corp , and Navy at the conclusion of Phase III, that is anticipated to be completed by FY 2006. The Rotorcraft SIGINT/COMINT Geolocation in applica The program enables collaborative interacti on between multiple rotorcrafts (manned or unmanned) for mapping, location and engag ement of RF emitters. This effort develops techniques to mitigate ro tor blade induced multipath. It demonstrates appropriate receiv er, signal processing and antenna technology, enabling ad hoc rotorc raft networks to rapidly characterize emitters. The Federated Object-level Exploitation (FOX) initiative assembles the results of image analyzers, target recognizers, and sign al processors into a collection (federation) of situation estimate s and describes objects of interest ranging from terrain, roads, and surface type to militarily significant vehicles, buildings, and people. The estimates enable prediction of future observables, enablin g differences between the predictions and the observations to trigger change detection and analysis that updates the estimates. The estimate s are maintained, in a consistent manner at multiple sites, distinguish ed by different areas of interest, target sets, and data sourc es. Technologies are evaluated on real-world data at experimental facilities co located with operational analysts, and transition takes place inc rementally as individual technologies mature. The Persistent Operational Surface Surveillan ce and Engagement (POSSE) program creates a system of systems framework in which a mix of surveillance assets, both operational and developmental can be c oordinated and exploited to yield persistent surveillanc e of insurgent activities. The program focus is on the Iraqi theatre, using a spiral approach designed to insert enhanced counter-i nsurgency 406UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION DATE February 2005 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Sensor Technology PE 0603767E, Project SEN-02 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 52 Page 25 of 34 capabilities into operational use as soon as possible, followed by im provements and enhancements as they become integrated thro ugh a domestic testbed. The efficacy and timeliness of surveillance a fforded by the program's systems-level approach will significan tly exceed that afforded by individual ISR components, and will result in substantially enhanced force pr otection for fixed sites, convoys , and military operations. The framework includes da ta exploitation at both forward-deployed and national sites to support both quic k-reaction cuing to engage insurgents, and deeper forensic analysis to identify their support structures.

The objectives are to provide: (1) rapid acquisition; (2) polarization exploitation; (3) intensity mapping; and (4) high range r esolution. Results will provide command ers with significantly improved identification of enemy ground-moving target s. Demonstrations employ existing commercial-off-the-shelf optics, focal plane arrays and gimbals, combined with a novel polariza tion-to-range mapping technique. The SPI-3D technology is plann ed for transition to the Air Force at the conclusion of Phase III that is anticipated to be completed by FY 2008. The Synthetic Aperture Ladar for Tactical Imaging (SALTI) initia tive will develop and demonstrate an airborne interferometric s ynthetic advanced laser radar (Ladar) imager capable of producing high -resolution three-dimensional imagery at long ranges. The ultimat e SALTI system will combine the long-range day/night access afforded by conventional synthetic ap erture radar (SAR) with the interpreta bility of high-resolution and the explo itability (3-D) imager y and fit within a tactical-sized packa ge suitable for deployment on a long-range unmanned air vehicle such as the Gl obal Hawk. The technical objective of the SALTI program is t o provide a proof-of-concept for operation at tactically relevant high altitudes and at long ground ranges. The SALTI technology is planned for transition to the Air Force by FY 2007. The Video Exploitation for Precision Identif ication initiative leverages numerous video sensors being introduced into the battl espace, providing more persistent and ubiquitous sensing over larger area s of interest. This initiative explores new ways to enhance t he performance of target recognition and site monitoring techniques through use denser da ta sets that exhibit high temporal and sp atial sampling rates, long-term observation, and pe rspective diversity. Particular topics of interest include: (1) video data minin g (e.g., extracting and representing behavior, represen ting and recognizing events and patterns of events, and characterizing patterns o f object motion); (2) learning for recognition and monitoring, (e.g., learning object categories from stereo or video sequences and lear ning event and behavior normalcy models); (3) modeling-on-the-fly (e.g., crea tion of active models and models that use recent advances in camera modeling and extraction of geometric inform ation and invariants); (4) novel sensing t echniques (e.g., dense, inexpensive camera arrays, polarization-sensing video cameras, and novel image formation pro cesses that could extract new or different types of informatio n, such as imaging through foliage or walls); (5) innovative space-time visua lization concepts (e.g., new approaches to 4D visualization o r visualization using video flashlights or paintbrushes); and (6) new approaches to recognition (e.g., recognizing classes of obj ects, inferring and reasoning about function, using scene or site models to object identification or characterization, recognizing ev ents, and using multi-view geometry, 3D curves, affine patches, or other invariant or semi-invariant techniques). 409UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2005 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Sensor Technology PE 0603767E, Project SEN-02 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 52 Page 28 of 34 The High Precision Long Range Laser Designator/Locator (HPLD) initiative seeks to develop an affo rdable laser target designator /locator package that allows the user to observe, track, and designate a target at operationally significant ranges. The focus of this effort is to develop new target-in-the-loop active opti cs approaches and novel high accuracy pointing methods to enable a single operator to precisely determine the GPS coordinates of a target over 5 kilometers away. Once precisely dete rmined, the operator will be able to obse rve, track, and laser designate the target as required, using a single device. This device will be used by ground combat elements and smal l unmanned aerial vehicles that conduct terminal attack control and call for fire and will be d esigned to support their full range of depl oyment methods. It will also survive in a harsh environment for long periods of time with minimal maintenance. DAR PA established an MOA with th e Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate for this program in August 2004. The High Precision Long Range Designator/Loca tor technology is planned for transition to the Army and SOCOM by FY 2008. The Omni-Directional Flash & Launch Detecti on, Positioning, Classification and Observation System (MEGA) program will develop a low-cost, omni-directional staring, infrared sensor, which will pr ovide circumpheral imagery of its surroundings. The MEGA se nsor and algorithms will be used to detect weapon discharges in its field of regard, locate and classify them and, using appropriate com munication means, convey the information to other units or systems connected to it.

Its emphasis is on surface targets and threats. Program e fforts are focused on exploiting emergent and no vel radar sensing technology and phenom enology. Key elements are adva ncements in ultra-wide UHF/VHF, polarimetric change detection, tomographic imaging, space-time adaptive processing and other advanced signal processin g, advanced Ground Moving Target Indication (GMTI) techniques, and foliage, bu ilding-penetrating, and ground-pe netrating radar phenomenolog y. Program developments are integrated with current and emerging military platforms. Emphasis is on the most stressing military radar sen sor challenges. Examples are operations featuring complex cl uttered ground environments; those against small and slow moving surface targets; u rban operations, and situations where camouflage, decoys a nd countermeasures must be overcome. Initia tives in this program include the followin g: The Wide Area All Terrain Change Indication and Tomography (WATCH-IT) initiative is developing real-time VHF/UHF synthetic aperture radar (SAR) automatic change det ection and target discrimination technologies. WATCH-IT provides the commander with r apid, robust detection of threat systems in the open, under camoufla ge, and in foliage. The program features discrimination algorith ms that examine change detections to determine if they have threat vehicle characteristics. Indications of change cue on- or off-board high- resolution sensors to perform target identification. WATCH-IT is designed to operate from platforms, such as high altitude unm anned air vehicles (UAVs). The technology will demonstrate high area-covera ge rates with few false alarms . WATCH-IT provides commanders with a critical capability that currently does not exist. The progr am also develops techniques to extract 3-D vehicle images f rom multiple- pass polarimetric SAR imagery. This capab ility enables rejection of confusers (i.e., decoys, relocated vehicles that are not o f military significance), thus greatly improves target classification/identification. DARPA estab lished an MOA with the National Geospati al - Intelligence Agency for this program in September 2004. The WA TCH-IT technology is planned for transition to the NGA at the conclusion of Phase II, anticipated to be completed by FY 2005. The Knowledge Aided Sensor Signal Processing and Expert Reasoning (KASSPER) initiative ra dically alters the fundamental \"front- end\" signal processing architectures of advanced military sensors. It accomplishes this through the real-time integration of a dyna mic environmental knowledge database. Real-tim e \"environmental awareness,\" absent in conventional systems, dramatically improves c lutter and interference rejection and significantly enhances sensor produc ts. Current radio frequency sensors with adaptive signal pr ocessing 412UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2005 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Sensor Technology PE 0603767E, Project SEN-02 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 52 Page 31 of 34 estimate the background interference using sample statistical estim ation. This necessarily entails an explicit assumption of s tationarity. However, sensors operating in real envir onments around the world demonstrate that this homogeneity assumption is not valid. Th e problem manifests itself in increased false alarms, decreased target detections, and s ubstantially degraded minimal detectable velocities in GMTI systems. KASSPER leverages the advent of detailed da tabases and high fidelity models to address inhomogeneities and non- stationarity at the front end of adaptive signal processing system s. Key technologies include a dvanced algorithms and high-per formance computing architectures capable of memory-i ntensive adaptive signal processing. The program includes data collections, and a r eal-time demonstration of its processing gains. The KASSPER technology is planned for transition to the Air Force during FY 2005. The Generation After Next Airborne Surveillance Radar (GAN) initia tive will evaluate new concepts for wide area coverage airbor ne ground surveillance radar technology by explo iting wide-beam staring systems rather than narrow-beam scanning systems. This ap proach would overcome challenges associated with low revisit rates, limi ted concurrency of modes, low power efficiency, low resolution , and sensor management. It is hypothesized that by supporting sever al modes on the aperture concurrently, GAN could offer better th an an order-of-magnitude improvement in radar productivity relative to current and emerging systems. The Tethered Ultra-Long baseline Sparse Aperture (TULSA) initiativ e is developing new means of exploiting single-ship airborne long- baseline sparse apertures. This initiative develops techniqu es for deploying, calibrating, powering, feeding and processing re ceived signals from active end bodies deployed on lo ng, towed tethers. TULSA also develops signal processing to support use of single -aircraft, towed long-baseline sparse arrays for: (1) emitter geolocation and multi-static such as GMTI multi- lateration. TULSA promises high-confidence geolocation of em itters from a single aircraft and provides commanders with characterization and targeting information for facilities, vehicles, and dismounted targets. The program also delivers tactica l situation awareness and supports strate gic indication and warning. The Networked Detection and Ranging (NetDAR) initiative is addressing an impending bandwi dth crisis in radar. Commercial press ures on bandwidth usage will make it difficult for military radar systems to operate in peace time without interfering with or being interfered by other transmission sources. This initiative will explore technologies to turn this bandwidth crisis into an asset. By using s ignals of opportunity across the spectrum, systems will be developed that can passively exploit a multi-static and only transmit to augme nt the RF propagation environment. Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) radar c oncepts will be developed that coherently integrate multiple s ignals to efficiently use the entire RF spectrum. This now makes all RF sources assets instead of interference sources. This will in clude adaptive waveform diversity and extending MIMO radar into airborne sources as a revolutionary approach to conventi onal multi-static rada r. 413UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET Exhibit) DATE February 2005 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Sensor Technology PE 0603767E, Project SEN-02 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 52 Page 32 of 34 (U) Program Plans: Wide Area All Terrain Change Indication and Tomography. -- Collect data using low-frequency, high-resolution polarimetric SARs. -- Quantify the robustness of wide area change detection to factors, such as aircraft heading, depression angle, database aging, topography and terrain cover.

(U) The Guidance Technology project will increase the ability of Global Positioning System (GPS) users to operate effectively in th e presence of enemy jamming; to increase the versatility of navigation systems applications by de veloping microelectromechanical sensor in ertial navigation system technologies; and to apply the geolocation technologies /techniques to precision threat geolocation of short-dwell emitte rs or passive air defense systems. Fire-and-forget standoff weapons need precise targeting information if critical fixed and mobile targets are to be eliminated effectively with minimal collateral damage and minimum cost-pe r-kill. This requires that: (1) military surveillance and targe ting systems geolocate targets accurately in the same coordinate system in wh ich the weapon system navigates; (2) the surveillance, targetin g and weapon systems have precision navigation and guidance systems on-board; and (3) navigation and target location systems robustly operat e day/night and in adverse weather. In addition, future systems designed to accomplish precision strike missions must be significantly more af fordable. The achievement of these characteristics in an inte grated system is the goal of this program. 417UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2005 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Guidance Technology PE 0603768E, R-1 # 53 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 53 Page 2 of 8 (U) Program Change Summary: (In Millions) FY 2005 FY 2006 FY -34.999 -38.137 Please note that this program element has been newly creat ed from projects previously funded in PE 0603762E.

The NAVSOPP program will use signals of opportunity and specialized signals from a variety of groun d-, air-, and space-based source s; these will be received on the warfighters' forth coming software defined radios , and will use specially tailored algorithms to determine posi tion. The greater strength and diversity of these signals will pr ovide coverage when GPS is denied due to lack of penetration into buildings and underground, and when severe multipath is a problem. The NAVSOPP is a two part program: (1) cataloging and assessing of potential exploitable signals followed by analysis and performance modeling and hard ware-based concept validation and (2) design ing, testing, and demonstrating of a ( non-form-fit) of a prototype receiver(s) and algorithms for geolocation using the signals of opportunity. The NAVSOPP technology is planned for transition to United States Special Operations Command and the Air Force at th e conclusion of Phase 3, and is anticipated to be completed by FY 2008.

The targeting system is d esigned to negate emitter shutdo wn tactics now employed to defeat anti-radiation missiles (ARM) guidance, and th ereby enable simplified ordnance inventories. The goal was to generate and distribute near real-time, comprehensive, and highly precise locat ion of threat radars to all theater combatant aircraft withou t deploying any additional SEAD-dedicated, emitter-collecting platforms. AT3 acco mplished this by widely deploying emitter collection packages hosted on existing airborne platforms, including combat aircraft. AT3 inte grated distributed multi-platform emitter collections in real- time using existing or planned tactical data links with advanced network management and signal processing. To achieve wide deployment, AT3 focused on transition through inexpensive upgrades to digital radar warning receivers. Enabling techno logies include: coupled GPS Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) packages, tactical communications, advanced highly dynamic data fusion network management capabilities, and algorithms to ensur e robust, flexible performance of geolocation algorithms for locating mu ltiple emitter types in noisy, high pulse density environments. AT3 has successfully completed strenuous flight tests and real-time multi-sh ip demonstrations with brassboa rd hardware. The AT3 techno logy is transitioning to the Air Force and Navy in FY 2005.
