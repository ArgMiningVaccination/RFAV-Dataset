The lawsuit was filed by Lorenzo and Melissa Catabrana, who say their son, Noah, developed autism following exposure to heavy metals in baby food made by Hain Celestial Group, Gerber Products Co. and other manufacturers.

While plaintiffs previously sought to consolidate the growing number of baby food lawsuits being filed in various U.S. District Courts in to single multi-district litigation, the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (JPML) denied the request, resulting in cases against various different manufacturers moving forward independently in a number of different jurisdictions nationwide.
