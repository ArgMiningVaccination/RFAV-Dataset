Good Nutrition \"I am a fan of targeted supplementation when needed\u2014I prefer to have my patients focus on their nutrition first,\" says Dr. Petrucci. She suggests [a diet focused on whole foods](https://www.forbes.com/health/womens-health/menopause/what-to-eat-menopause/) and other [key vitamins and minerals](https://www.forbes.com/health/womens-health/best-multivitamins-women/). \"A diet rich in vegetables, lean proteins and healthy fat is going to restore a woman's health faster than a supplement,\" she says. Fiber Dr. Petrucci also suggests amping up [fiber intake](https://www.forbes.com/health/body/best-fiber-snacks/). \"The health of the gut affects everything from our immune system to our moods,\" she says. \"Our good gut bacteria loves to feed on fiber, so women need to be very mindful that they are getting at least 25 to 30 grams a day,\" she says. If your diet isn't supplying enough, a tablespoon or two of [flax seeds](https://www.forbes.com/health/body/flaxseed/) is a great way to sneak in more fiber. Prebiotics and Probiotics An imbalance of good and bad bacteria in the gut can interfere with the body's ability to absorb and use nutrients properly. \"This imbalance may also launch a cascade of unpleasant symptoms like [bloating](https://www.forbes.com/health/womens-health/menopause/menopause-belly-bloating/), gas and other intestinal issues,\" says Dr. Petrucci. A combination prebiotic and [probiotic supplement](https://www.forbes.com/health/body/best-probiotics/) can support a healthy gut by balancing the good and bad bacteria. \"In addition, several key hormones are made in the digestive tract, so we need to [keep our gut healthy](https://www.forbes.com/health/body/best-foods-for-gut-health/) to support this process,\" she adds. Vitamin D [Vitamin D](https://www.forbes.com/health/body/vitamin-d-guide/) can help keep your other hormones balanced, so Dr. Petrucci suggests spending at least 15 minutes a day in the sun or taking an additional supplement if it isn't included in your menopause supplement. B Vitamins B vitamins are essential for energy and mood\u2014\"two things a lot of menopausal women struggle with,\" says Dr. Petrucci. She suggests a B complex supplement, which often includes vitamin B12, methylcobalamin, folic acid and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate. Magnesium Dr. Petrucci also suggests [magnesium](https://www.forbes.com/health/body/best-magnesium-supplement/) for its ability to calm the nervous system. \"During menopause, I find it essential for better quality sleep,\" she says. Collagen When you hit menopause, your collagen production decreases dramatically \"because estrogen is critical for maintaining collagen. As you lose estrogen, you also lose collagen,\" says Dr. Petrucci, who has a line of supplements, including collagen. \"Add hydrolyzed [collagen powder](https://www.forbes.com/health/body/best-collagen-powders/) or bone broth to your daily diet to support gut, skin and joint health.\" Get Ahead Of Menopause Symptoms We formulate with clinically proven nutrients and source with great care.

She suggests a product called Equelle, which is derived from soy and can be helpful for hot flash relief. Estrogen Therapy As previously mentioned, estrogen therapy is the most effective therapy for menopausal hot flashes, per Dr. Minkin.
