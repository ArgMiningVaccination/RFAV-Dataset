When Eileen McGuirk was admitted to Mass General in 2012 for treatment of an advanced cancer, she was overwhelmed by a nonstop fl ow of well-wishers. While she appreciated their love and support, the steady stream of visitors was depleting the energy she needed to heal. Her husband had an idea. Doug recruited their daughter Erin to reach out to family and friends via social media. The next day at high noon, more than 200 well-wishers joined together for a fl ash mob-style rally on Ebersol Field\u201421 stories below Eileen's hospital room. They held signs, synchronized a stadium-style wave that rivaled Fenway Park's best, performed a loosely choreographed dance, and ultimately joined hands to form a giant heart. Throughout the performance, Eileen watched from her hospital window, surrounded by those dearest to her\u2014her mother, father, brother and sister-in-law, husband, daughter, son and fi anc\u00e9e (who had just announced their engagement!), and her oldest and dearest friends. Looking through binoculars and listening to the cheers and serenades by cell phone, she glanced one by one at each person on the fi eld, calling out names to the smaller group in her room. Then she connected briefl y with friend after friend below as they passed a cell phone through the crowd. \"When we felt helpless,\" said Eileen's friend, Jennifer Mscisz, \"this was a way for everyone to get together and kind of lift Eileen's spirits, to let her know how much we loved her and cared for her.\" Eileen got the message\u2014loud and clear\u2014and it was spectacular. Innovation at its best! 3Guided by the needs of our patients and their families, we aim to deliver the very best healthcare in a safe, compassionate environment; to advance that care through innovative research and education; and to improve the health and well-being of the diverse communities we serve.The Mass General MissionDear Friends and Colleagues, Innovation comes in many shapes and sizes. It can be found in the simplest of thoughts and gestures and in the boldest and broadest of visions and ideas. We witness it in the heartfelt gathering of a fl ash mob on Ebersol Field. It's seen in the multiple interdisciplinary care teams working toward a single patient's most dearly held goal. And it's part of the fabric of the one-on-one care provided throughout MGH every day. Whether sparked by one person's idea or the collective actions of a like-minded and committed group, innovation\u2014at its core\u2014is about making things better. In healthcare, we face a myriad of escalating challenges in our quest to provide the best possible care to each and every patient and family we serve. With this in mind, in March 2012 MGH formally launched an unprecedented effort to establish a blueprint for the future of care delivery. We established 12 Innovation Units, designed to be safe testing grounds for new care delivery advances and ideas. Soon we began to see signs of a care delivery model that was more ef cient, effective and patient- and family-centered. And we were able to sustain our momentum. The next phase involves sharing lessons learned throughout MGH and beyond our walls. In the MGH tradition, throughout 2012, innovation outside these 12 units continued to thrive and took many forms. Staff rallied to help a medically challenged patient travel overseas with family. We established the Connell Ethics Fellowship and the Connell Nursing Research Scholars Program. We leveraged the Knight Simulation Program to expose Boston high school students to the realities of healthcare delivery. And we persevered to ful ll the dying wish of a homeless man. The stories are numerous. Innovation indeed comes in many shapes and sizes. I hope you will enjoy the snapshot of 2012 in MGH Patient Care Services that this report provides. Guided by the needs of the patients and families who entrust us with their care, we continue to strive for Excellence Every Day! Best, Jeanette Ives Erickson, RN, DNP , F AAN Senior Vice President for Patient Care and Chief Nurse 5The Heart of Innovation advancing interdisciplinary care delivery In 2011\u2014as the Affordable Care Act began to spark a healthcare revolution throughout the US\u2014Mass General launched an unprecedented effortto design a blueprint for the future of care delivery. Although the pathahead was somewhat uncertain at the time, the PCS leadership teamknew exactly where and how to start. We began with the patient andfamily and tapped into the wisdom and creativity of our staff. Following months of strategic planning and preparation, in March 2012,MGH offi cially launched 12 Innovation Units (see \"A Legacy of Leadership and Innovation...Patient Care at 200,\" 2011 PCS Annual Report). Guided by a newly developed \"Patient Journey Framework,\" these Innovation Units were designed to be safe testing grounds for new care delivery advances and ideas that would readily demonstrate which proposed changes worked and which did not. 7Advancing interdisciplinary care delivery Among the early fi ndings, the 12 MGH Innovation Units realized patient satisfaction scores that increased at more than double the rate of other like units, a 5 percent decrease in lengths of stay, and a 3 percent drop in readmission rates. \"To date, fi ndings have been Jeanette Ives Erickson, RN, DNP , FAAN, senior vice president for Patient Care and chief nurse. \"We are encouraged by the impact the Innovation Unit interventions are having on interdisciplinary teamwork and communication, the patient and family experience, and other key indicators.\" Ongoing evaluation of the units is being conducted by nurse scientists in The Center for Innovations in Care Delivery and The Yvonne L. Munn Center for Nursing Research. Quantitative metrics being tracked include statistics about patient safety, length of stay, readmissions, quality indicators, cost per case mix, and staff retention, as well as the results of patient and staff satisfaction surveys such as the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) tool and the Revised Staff Perceptions of the Professional Practice Environment scale. Qualitative metrics include focus groups comprised of staff, patients and families, as well as observations and narrative reports.Early data for what may be two of the most signifi cant interventions\u2014 the new role of attending nurse (ARN) and hard wiring into practice the philosophy of relationship-based care, which emphasizes the connection between patients and providers\u2014point to success. According to Jeff Adams, RN, PhD, director of the Center for Innovations, the attending nurse role was embraced by all role groups and disciplines and was described by many as \"a Patient satisfaction scores on the Innovation Units increased at more than double the rate of other like units. 8signifi cant innovation.\" The ARNs function as clinical leaders, working with staff nurses, interdisciplinary team members, patients and family members to manage the care of patients on a single unit from admission to discharge. The ARN is part navigator, advocate, educator and discharge nurse and gives patients, families and staff a consistent presence throughout the patient's hospitalization and post-discharge period. An in-depth look at the ARN follows in \"The Attending RN...introducing a new clinical role.\" \"Staff have consistently described the 'importance of embracing the philosophy of relationship-based care to guide care delivery,'\" says Dorothy A. Jones, EdD, RNC, FAAN, director of The Yvonne L. Munn Center for Nursing Research. Although more evaluation is needed, it is clear something positive is happening. The Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers & Systems (HCAHPS) survey results through 2012 further support this claim. \"We were pleased to see our patient satisfaction scores on the Innovation Units increase across the board,\" says Rick Evans, director of MGH Service Improvement. \"Measures improved at a rate that was greater than seen on other units for virtually every measure.\" (right, \"HCAHPS Results\u20142011 vs. 2012\") The Innovation Unit approach The methodology of the Innovation Unit initiative involved reducing variation wherever possible, implementing evidence-based solutions, introducing and/or adapting technology to support practice, and fostering high-quality care by ensuring that all members of the team practiced to the full extent of their role. The interventions represented \"top priority\" actions that would lead to the highest levels of consistency, continuity and effi ciency. In addition to the new ARN role,other specifi c evidence-based interventions played a key role in advancing care delivery.HCAHPS Results\u20142011 vs. 2012 Survey Measure MGH 2012Change (2011 - 2012)Innovation Units 2012 Change (2011 - 2012) Nurse Communication Composite 81.0 +1.6 80.8 +4.5 Doctor 72.9 +3.1 2012Change (2011 - 2012)Innovation Units 2012 Change (2011 - 2012) Nurse Communication Composite 81.0 +1.6 80.8 +4.5 Doctor 72.9 +3.1 2012 Score exceeds that of entire hospital2012 Score exceeds that of entire hospital Rate of Improvement Exceeds that of the entire hospitalRate of Improvement Exceeds that of the entire hospital 11INTERVENTION SPOTLIGHT Enhancing pre-admission data collectionTo ensure continuity and accurate information-gathering for all patient populations, an interdisciplinary Tiger Team created a new Admitting Face Sheet that includes anticipated discharge date and disposition to better inform the interdisciplinarycare planning. ARN business card At admission, the ARN gives the patient and family a business card that establishes an open line of communication, both during and after the patient's hospitalization. Welcome packets A new Welcome Packet provides patients and families with relevant information, invites feedback for improvement, and helps set expectations and prepare them for the hospitalization and discharge. A \"Patient & Family Notebook\" includes a Universal Patient Compact, care team overview, and space to note questions for caregivers. A \"Discharge Envelope\" features a checklist that 12prompts discussion around key transition topics, including home care, nutrition and follow-up appointments, and centrally stores important items such as prescriptions and educational materials. Domains of practice With the implementation of interdisciplinary rounds, having a greater understanding of the domains of practice of colleagues in other disciplines becomes increasingly important. Each discipline within Patient Care Services updated descriptions of its domains of practice and shared these in various forums, including the Excellence Every Day web portal. Supporting technology Effi cient, well-coordinated care depends on staff's ability to communicate effectively. Staff on Innovation Units are equipped with specially programmed cell phones and portable, wireless laptops to make access to and dissemination of information more effi cient. Electronic whiteboards at nurses' stations enhance staff's ability to know patients and coordinate care.Interdisciplinary team rounds Interdisciplinary rounds bring all members of the team together on a daily basis to identify obstacles to the progression of care, create a more holistic approach to care delivery, and ensure that issues are shared and addressed in a timely manner. In-room whiteboards Standardized in-room whiteboards display key pieces of information, including the names of the patient's physician, nurse and other team members; the \"goal for the day\";and space to note questions for the care team. Discharge planning and readiness A new Discharge Checklist is being developed, and a Discharge Follow-up Phone Call Program is being implemented. All patients are eligible to participate. In the initial stages of the Innovation Unit rollout, a standard questionnaire, guidelines, and training curriculum were developed. Other interventions are highlighted throughout this report.Spreading best practices \"By sharing best practices and standardizing whenever possible, we're continuing to improve systems, refi ne care delivery, and mine the creativity and innovative thinking that has brought us so far,\" says Ives Erickson. \"Looking ahead, we plan to roll out to all inpatient units those Innovation Unit interventions that are proving successful and to continue to share our fi ndings nationally and internationally.\" The Innovation Unit work has begun to attract national interest and has been featured in the documentary \"NURSES: If Florence Could See Us Now,\" recognized by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's \"Transitions to Better Care\" video contest. It has also been reported in a variety of publications, including \"Nurse Leadership from Bedside to Boardroom,\" Patient Safety & Quality Healthcare ; \"Attending Registered Nurse, an Innovative Role to Manage Between the Spaces,\" Nursing Economics ; \"Nurses Leading Through Innovation,\" The American Nurse ; and \"'Innovation Advisers' Chosen for Ideas to Improve Health Care, Cut Costs,\" The Washington Post . 13 (For more information, see \"Attending Registered Nurse, An Innovative Role to Manage Between the Spaces,\" Nursing Economics, 2012 Sept-Oct;30(5):282-287.) 15Each of the initial Phase 1 Innovation Units was asked to commit to the development of a new patient care delivery model that improved the patient's journey. The Patient Journey Framework (opposite page) was designed to help guide this work. Engaging clinicians and patients in identifying ineffi ciencies in the delivery system quickly led to a greater understanding of the importance of relationships with patients, families, and within the care team. Relationship-based care as suggested by Koloroutis and colleagues (2004) provided a new way to ask ourselves how we would redesign interdisciplinary care. Once we gained greater understanding of relationship-based care, we asked ourselves, \"What would our care delivery model look like if 'relationship-based care' was embedded into the very fabric of the organization?\" The second question was, \"What would it take to change the very nature of how we worked together as a team and how we worked with patients and families?\" These questions led to the identifi cation of both a philosophical underpinning for the delivery model and the initial interventions for the Innovation Units. The Attending RN...introducing a new clinical role Every patient hospitalized at MGH has a registered nurse responsible for their care. With the development of a new clinical nursing role, MGH Innovation Unit patients also now have an Attending Registered Nurse (ARN) assigned to their care throughout their hospital stay. While staff nurses continue to be the backbone of the care delivery system, the ARN is a clinical nurse who is specifi cally responsible for ensuring the continuity of the patient's overall care plan\u2014from admission through discharge\u2014functioning as the primary contact for the care team as a whole and its individual members, as well as patients and families. \"I describe the ARN as the 'constant' nurse,\" says Jean Stewart, RN, attending nurse on the White 6 Orthopaedics Unit. \"I'll be there every day as the glue that keeps the patient's hospital experience cohesive and moving forward, and later I'll be calling them at home to be sure they're making a smooth and safe transition.\" The launch of MGH's Innovation Units was based on studies that show there are points along the Patient Journey where specifi c interventions may enhance an already high quality of care delivery. The new ARN role has proven to be one such signifi cant intervention. By design, ARNs are given the responsibility to \"manage between the spaces,\" facilitating care with the entire healthcare team, ensuring the continuity of care, and providing patients and families a readily available and familiar \"go to\" person before, during and after hospitalization. The role requires a dynamic set of individual competencies, knowledge, and an approach that is tailored to the particular needs of each patient care unit. Ideal ARN candidates are experienced, highly regarded, inquisitive nurses who are committed to advancing change\u2014no small task. They also commit to work schedules designed to promote continuity and relationship-based care for patients, families and care team members alike. \"Although the ARN role has successfully become part of the care delivery framework,\" says Karen Rosenblum, RN, attending nurse on the Blake 11 Psychiatry Unit, \"there is no 'typical day' for an attending nurse.\" Every ARN is assigned a specifi c number of patients. On some units, two ARNs may cover 10 patients each; on others, only 17high-risk patients may work with an ARN. For each patient they are assigned, the ARNs are involved in developing a comprehensive patient-care assessment and plan with the interdisciplinary care team, fostering collaboration, coordinating meetings and team huddles to facilitate timely clinical decision making, developing and revising patient care goals with the clinical team daily, identifying and resolving barriers to optimum care, promoting seamless handovers, communicating with patients and families around the plan of care, answering questions, teaching and coaching\u2014anything that contributes to making the patient's journey a smooth one. \"We introduce ourselves to each patient and family as they arrive on the unit and let them know about the Innovation Unit concept and the ARN role,\" says Sandy Masiello, RN, an ARN on the Blake 13 Newborn Family Unit. \"We review the Patient and Family Notebook, encourage them to jot down any questions or concerns they want to discuss with the team, and we continue to reference the notebook throughout their stay.\" ARNs are also involved in daily interdisciplinary rounds and in coordinating details of their patients' care plans and anticipated discharge, for example, ensuring tests are scheduled, prescriptions written, follow-up appointments noted, any required home care set up\u2014all tailored to the needs of each individual patient. The ARN role combines the functions of navigator, advocate, educator, and discharge nurse, and gives patients and families a consistent presence and much-needed peace of mind throughout their hospitalization. \"As an ARN, it's incredibly gratifying to know I'm having a direct impact on the hospital experience for patients and families and also staff,\" says Gina Chan, RN, attending nurse on the Bigelow 14 Vascular Surgery Unit. \"Being able to follow patients daily and share information with the whole team has improved communication, improved care and most important, improved patient outcomes.\" 18Successful Joint Commission survey From July 23, 2012\u2014just one week after U.S. News & World Report named MGH No. 1 on its \"Best Hospitals Honor Roll\"\u2014The Joint Commission arrived at the doors of the hospital to conduct its own week-long assessment. This came in the form of a triennial, unannounced accreditation survey. For the subsequent five days, seven Joint Commission surveyors performed a thorough examination of the environment, processes, operations, and practices throughout the main campus and at several off-site locations, including our health centers and clinics. In the words of John Belknap, director of Corporate Compliance, \"It was a fantastic week.\" For others within the MGH community, the weeklong visit reaffi rmed how special an organization MGH truly is\u2014a point the survey team made over and over. \"It has been an absolute delight interacting with your staff,\" said surveyor Kate Townsend, RN. \"One nurse told me everything about her patient without once looking at the patient's record.\" Surveyor Paul Ducharme, CHFM, shared that \"Every hospital in every major city in the country could learn and benefit from your Emergency Management system.\" As with any outside assessment, the survey also provided an invaluable opportunity to learn. At its conclusion\u2014and as is customary\u2014The Joint Commission issued a report listing Requirements for Improvement, areas where an organization must respond with corrective action plans. MGH staff immediately responded to the fi ndings to further the hospital's commitment to provide the very best possible care for patients and families. In the spirit of transparency, a summary of the 2012 performance is available via the hospital's web site. While there is no disputing the importance of a favorable Joint Commission survey, the best measure of success was found in the feedback from MGH patients and families. One after the other, unit after unit, they stated they felt safe and cared for. the heart o f INTERVENTION SPOTLIGHT Discharge phone calls Patients often leave the hospital with what can seem a staggering amount of important information\u2014how to care for a wound, a list of dos and don'ts to promote healing, home care schedules, dates of follow-up appointments, and more. It can feel overwhelming. The MGH Innovation Units tested the practice of having unit-based nurses call patients at home within 48 hours of being discharged as a way of supporting patients during their transition. The calls keep the line of communication open, giving patients and family members an opportunity to ask questions or raise any concerns. According to early feedback, the calls give the patients and families extra peace of mind when most needed. In several cases, staff have been able to intervene and assist patients who had new questions about their discharge care plan, likely helping them avoid extended health problems and additional hospitalizations.f innovation The power of the narrative Staff at MGH have long appreciated the benefi ts of a narrative culture. Recently two disciplines discovered its potential for fostering interprofessional education. Physical and Occupational Therapy piloted a Narrative Rounds program in which staff present narratives in small-group settings and then \"unbundle\" them with feedback from the group, providing greater insight into clinical practice. Response from both departments was overwhelmingly positive. \"Based on staff response to the pilot, we knew this approach was getting at something different,\" said Ann Jampel, PT, clinical education coordinator for Physical and Occupational Therapy. \"When surveyed, 92 percent of staff responding to questions about the pilot session agreed or strongly agreed that narrative rounds helped foster professional development.\" As one respondent said, \"It was an opportunity for two areas of practice to come together and discuss common patient challenges.\" Jampel and two of her colleagues, Mary Knab, PT, physical therapy specialist and faculty member at the MGH Institute of Health Professions, and Karen Turner, OTR/L, occupational therapist, recognized that for the writer, a clinical narrative is a retrospective learning process that allows clinicians to refl ect on their practice. With the added dimension of group discussion, the learning becomes prospective as clinicians discuss how it can be applied to future care. The three had an opportunity to share their fi ndings at the national level, presenting at the annual American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) Educational Leadership Conference, during which 10 participants volunteered to be part of a \"fi shbowl\" discussion about a narrative while the other attendees observed. By the end, it was clear that the unbundling process had allowed this group of physical therapy educators to experience occupational therapy practice in an entirely different way. As one participant shared, \"The concept of selecting the 'just right' challenge for a patient now has a context and specifi city that brings clarity to the OT role.\" She was looking forward to sharing the approach with her own colleagues. 21the heart of innovation Club STAR Amid the many challenges children face growing up today, the loss of a brother or sister or a parent can be devastating. Club STAR (Sharing Together and Remembering) is a monthly bereavement group for children 5-18 years old who have experienced the loss of a sibling. This past year the program expanded to include children and teens who are grieving the loss of a parent. Club STAR was started in 2010 as a collaboration between child life specialists and social workers with support from the Ladies Visiting Committee. The program provides a healing space for parents, children and caregivers to come together with other families coping with similar losses and to connect and learn from one another. As one teen member of the group best summarized the program's impact, \"I felt better just walking into the group the fi rst night because I realized I wasn't alone.\" At the beginning of each group session, children and family members place a smooth stone into a glass bowl and share a special memory of their loved one. Child life specialists then lead the children in creative projects and memory-making activities to facilitate the sharing of feelings and personal stories. Child life specialists are healthcare professionals specifi cally trained to help children and families overcome challenging life events through play, preparation, education, and self-expression. They collaborate with nurses, social workers, physicians, and therapists to facilitate a positive hospital experience, and they work with inter-disciplinary teams to create programs for the entire family both during hospitalization and after discharge. Since its inception Club STAR has supported 23 families, and today referrals come from throughout the city of Boston. 22INTERVENTION SPOTLIGHT Handheld communication devices A new handheld communication system utilizes repurposed iPhones and an application that allows for voice calling and text messaging between nurses and staff throughout the hospital. The system enhances communication for nurses by enabling instant and convenient sharing of information. Group text messaging and customizable template messages also increase the effi ciency and ease of using these devices. The introduction of this technology has helped reduce and, in some cases, eliminate overhead paging on units, contributing to a quieter care environment. ,p g g on units, contributin g to a quieter care environment. Reverend John Polk, DMin, BCC, was named director of Chaplaincy in July 2012. He most recently served as interim director of the Spiritual Wellness Department, St. Luke's Hospital in Kansas City, Missouri. With more than 15 years' experience in healthcare chaplaincy and years of dedicated service as a pastor to different congregations, Polk is excited to step into this new leadership role of advancing spiritual care for patients and families. Chaplains assess and respond to the spiritual needs and concerns of patients and family members of diverse cultures, traditions and beliefs. Upon arriving at MGH, Polk embarked on a listening and learning tour to quickly acquaint himself with the hospital and to identify the needs of both the MGH community and his department. Following his tour, he developed a 12-month strategic plan that now guides the focus and direction of the Chaplaincy Department. He is likewise beginning to standardize a handful of the department's best practices and incorporate these into the interventions in the newly established Innovation Units, for example, interdisciplinary rounding. Donation supports two new programs Healthcare today moves at a fast pace, often with competing demands. It can be challenging to carve out time to advance the stu dy or research of a particular area of interest, as well as carve out re fl ective time to observe and consider the ethical impact of the fast pace of healthcare, which is replete with issues such as advances in medical technology and the impending changes of healthcare reform. Through the generosity of the Connell family, local entrepreneurs and philanthropists, PCS has launched two important new programs that will afford clinicians something invaluable: dedicated time to help advance practice through focused research and education. The Connell Ethics Fellowship will allow two experienced health professionals from Patient Care Services\u2014one nurse and one allied health professional\u2014to develop and re ne their clinical ethics expertise. Upon completion of the program, the Connell fellows will serve the MGH community as ethics resources and play a part in addressing ethical issues through clinical ethics consultat ions, unit- based interventions, and ethics committee participation. The intensive, one-year training program, under the supervision of a c linical nurse ethicist with ethics faculty, will provide opportunities for fellows to acquire historical, philosophical and empirical k nowledge and to receive mentoring in ethical problem-solving, consultation and facilitation. The Connell Nursing Research Scholars Program The Connell Nursing Research Scholars Program is designed to promote interdisciplinary patient- and family-centered care through nursing research. Four Connell nursing research scholars\u2014novice and mid- career\u2014will have dedicated time and resources each week to advance their particular research agendas. The initial proposals wil l focus on the high-priority areas of: Care of the elderly patient and family experiences and end-of-life care Workforce evaluation Interventions to decrease risk and improve management of hospital infections, pressure ulcers and falls, and enhance effectiv e pain management Research methodologies to effectively measure the impact of nurse-driven interventions on patient care outcomes Evaluation of educational programs for staff and patients Efforts to promote the evaluation of the professional practice environment (internationally) Development of theoretical models to guide practice, advance nursing science and integrate and in fl uence other ideas consistent with the goals of Patient Care Servicesthe heart of innovation 24\"I need to nd my family.\" These were the fi rst words clinical social worker Samantha Tarcov-Block heard as she walked into her new patient's room. \"Mr. M\" was a middle-aged man with little-known medical history who had been diagnosed with widespread metastatic disease and changes in his mental status. Not only did the team want to honor their patient's last wish, but they hoped to fi nd a family member who could participate in Mr. M's medical decision making as he grew less and less able to do so himself. A member of the interdisciplinary care team had searched with no success, and it became clear they needed the help of Social Service. Social workers are a vital part of the care team, helping patients and families deal with challenging issues, improve relationships, solve problems, and get through diffi cult times. They are uniquely prepared to help patients cope with the specifi c circumstances surrounding their illness and hospitalization. Life can take unexpected turns at any moment. In the case of Mr. M, he had been homeless for several years, eventually losing complete touch with his family. Tarcov-Block began an intensive search for relatives that included calling virtually every local homeless shelter in hopes of fi nding any kind of clue. She pursued a few leads, all of which turned up empty. Those who did know Mr. M thought his family members were already deceased. Tarcov-Block pressed on with no luck. She remembers very clearly the morning she received the page from the team that Mr. M's condition had dramatically deteriorated; he might not survive the day. Although it seemed futile, she continued the search, once again launching an Internet search. Time passed, and countless mouse-clicks later, there it was: a vague reference to what could be a relative. Eureka!\u2014Tarcov-Block discovered several family members of Mr. M who were living in eastern Massachusetts. Despite the gravity of his condition, Mr. M's relatives were relieved to learn he had been found and was in good hands. They rushed to the hospital, where they arrived not so much hopeful as grateful to have an opportunity to give Mr. M the most precious gift imaginable: He was able to spend the fi nal moments of his life surrounded by those he most loved. 25Wayne Newell assumed directorship of Volunteer and Information Ambassador Services in March 2012. He served as program manager for Volunteer Services for the prior four years, increasing the total volunteer hours to more than 106,000 annually and developing a front-end Emergency Department (ED) guide volunteer role to assist patients and families in the hospital's newly expanded ED. Newell's career spans 36 years at Mass General; he previously served in several supervisory and managerial positions in Clinical Administration, as director of Materials Management, and as the evening administrative supervisor in the ED. In his new role he will oversee more than 1,500 volunteers, as well as the Volunteer and Information Associates programs, continuing to match volunteer resources and develop volunteer programs in support of the hospital mission. A true spokesperson MGH clinicians frequently go the extra mile for their patients and families. But going an extra 180 miles\u2014that's something else again. In June 2012, MGH nurse Kristin Beauparlant, RN, did just that, cycling from the White Mountains of New Hampshire to the Atlantic coastline. It was all about honoring the dying wish of a former patient. Her inspiration, Elizabeth \"Beth\" Bennett Rice, was a vibrant woman diagnosed with a rare and aggressive cancer in 2005. Even before being diagnosed, Bennett Rice had been a long-standing participant in the 190-mile Pan Mass Challenge, the country's largest sports-related cancer fund-raiser. She knew the cure would one day be found through research and education. As Bennett Rice's disease progressed, she spent many hours in her hospital bed at work on her laptop computer. She was laying the groundwork for an organization that would benefi t research and education at MGH\u2014she envisioned the \"Madam Ovary Foundation.\" Now three years after her death, her vision had become reality. In a fi tting inaugural event, Beauparlant accompanied Bennett Rice's husband and several family friends as they made the 180-mile ride through the Granite State to raise money that would help fund research in ovarian cancer at MGH.As an added tribute, Beauparlant made the journey riding Bennett Rice's bicycle. Bennett Rice's husband, Peter, carried his wife's signature pearl necklace, the one she wore on so many other charity rides throughoutthe years. the 26A different approach Every clinical team is stronger because of the diversity of expertise brought by its various members. In the case of \"Mary,\" it was speech-language pathologist Danny Nunn, SLP , who began to crack the mystery behind one patient's decline. Mary was a 90-year-old woman with a history of advanced dementia, admitted to MGH with pneumonia. Throughout her fi rst week at the hospital, Mary's mental status continued to worsen. She was very fi dgety and constantly picking at her IV , which she had managed to remove three times. Although she had initially been able to walk, she had not gotten out of bed while in the hospital. She was now on IV fl uids and antibiotics and a diet of pureed foods and honey-thick liquids. However, Mary was most often too sleepy to be fed or just refused to eat altogether. The team had tried to place a feeding tube through her nose, but Mary became too agitated during the attempt. There was a lingering concern by the team that Mary's pneumonia stemmed from an aspiration or breathing in food or fl uid. Her two devoted daughters were extremely concerned that maybe they had done something wrong when feeding her, and they were anxious for ideas about what they could do to help their failing mother. Her care team contacted the Speech-Language Department for an evaluation. Mary was quite lethargic when she was initially examined by Nunn. When Nunn returned later in the day, Mary was more awake but still refusing to eat or drink anything. No amount of coaxing or cajoling helped. Her daughters were increasingly concerned and hoping to avoid the prospect of a feeding tube. The next day, Nunn came prepared to try a different approach, armed with tea and cookies. She set a small table at Mary's bedside, setting up chairs for herself and Mary's two daughters, and positioning Mary to eliminate any risk of aspiration. Nunn encouraged the daughters to start eating with her to make a more natural environment. As one of her daughters reached for a cookie, Mary reached for one of her own. And then another. The tea party began, and with it Mary's recovery. heart of innovation s nny d at y been n IV fl uids ary was most often too sleepy to be 27Focus areas for Process Improvement With an eye toward providing safe and high-quality care, the hospital community rallied around four primary process improvement initiatives: Medication reconciliation \u2014Medication reconciliation, both for patients admitted to the hospital and those coming to the hospital for ambulatory care, means collecting and documenting a complete list of medications being taken by each patient. For ambulatory patients, the medication list is updated during each visit and reconciled to refl ect any changes. Patients are given copies of their reconciled medication lists for theirown records. Universal protocol \u2014Universal protocol must be conducted before all surgical and other invasive procedures that expose patients to more than minimal risk. Universal protocol ensures that the right patient receives the right procedure at the right site. Reducing hospital-acquired infection s\u2014MGH has focused a great deal on decreasing healthcare-associated infections throughdiligent hand-hygiene practices before and after patient contact and through the appropriate use of protective gloves, garments, and equipment. Effi ciency and effectiveness \u2014A wide range of care redesign initiatives, including the implementation of Innovation Units, is helping us achieve greater effi ciency and effectiveness in care delivery. Innovation Units are designated inpatient units being used as testing grounds for change, allowing us toquickly determine whether new ideas should beadopted, adapted or abandoned. Interdisciplinary rounding Interdisciplinary rounding consists of regularly scheduled huddles with all members of the care team, representing many disciplines involved in care delivery. Clinicians participate in conversations involving patient updates and progress in order to help create the best and most complete plan of care. Staff have commented that interdisciplinary rounding helps streamline communications between different departments and provides an opportunity for staff to better advocate for their patients. Likewise, the rounds have enhanced continuity of care and improved the staff's ability to identify and address the comprehensive needs of patients. INTERVENTION SPOTLIGHT theBreathing a bit easier Last year Mark Rosen made an overseas pilgrimage he once thought impossible. He wanted to visit Israel with his children to help connect them to their heritage. A 62-year-old patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Rosen knew he faced multiple challenges: He relied on a motorized wheelchair, an electronic communication device, and a portable ventilator at night. Help came from an interdisciplinary care team, with vital input from Respiratory Care services. At MGH, Respiratory Care employs more than 85 registered therapists who are frequently consulted by nurses and physicians to help assess and treat patients in respiratory distress or failure. To specifi cally address Rosen's breathing needs, the respiratory care team, pulmonary function laboratory, and his pulmonologist worked together to perform a variety of critical tests, including high-altitude simulation testing to determine the minimum concentration of oxygen their patient would require during a transatlantic fl ight. Their care plan also had to include addressing airline specifi cations for acceptable equipment, coordinating with medical equipment providers, and performing battery-life tests. \"The most important thing we learned,\" says Nancy Davis, RRT, AE-C, chronic care coordinator and respiratory therapist, \"is that when everyone works toward a common goal, there's a good chance you'll not only achieve that goal, but you may exceed everyone's expectations in the process.\" Despite the complexity of the situation, Rosen's trip was a complete success, providing unbounded inspiration for the days to come. \"The trip strengthened my resolve to keep fi ghting ALS with all my might,\" says Rosen. A man of his word, he is already planning future travels. e heart of innovation 29INTERVENTION SPOTLIGHT Quiet hours Resting is a simple but crucial part of the healing process. Ironically, it's the very equipment and activities involved in quality care delivery\u2014the technology, IV pumps, monitors, frequent rounding, medication delivery\u2014that can make a patient's room feel less than restful. In an effort to promote a better healing environment, the MGH Innovation Units tested \"quiet hours\" during designated periods. The goal is to create blocks of time for patients to get some much-needed rest. Quiet time involves simple changes\u2014dimming lights in the hallway, talking with \"library voices,\" closing patient doors when possible, and clustering routine care before or after quiet hours. The introduction of quiet hours has produced remarkable results, allowing patients to get the rest they need. In the early testing, patients surveyed reported a 6.6 percent improvement in noise levels on their unit. Quiet Time Resting is Healing We offer Quiet Time every day 3:30 - 5:30 pm 10:00 pm - 6:00 am Please be respectful of our healing patients Hands-on learning In the spring of 2012, the Knight Simulation Program took job shadowing to a whole new level. Sixteen high school juniors had an opportunity to see fi rsthand how the human respiratory system functions thanks to a number of scenarios played out on clinical simulators. The students were enrolled in the MGH Youth Scholars Program, a four-year program for Boston high school students interested in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) with a focus on healthcare and college readiness. \"Staff from the Knight Simulation Program met with biology, chemistry, and anatomy teachers to develop a classroom model for this innovative new program that had a curriculum aligned with a healthcare perspective,\" says Brian French, RN, director of The Knight Simulation Program. \"And at MGH, we chose to develop simulation scenarios that focused on problems in the community.\" Nurse educators in the Knight Simulation Program prepared a four-week curriculum that allowed students to apply their science knowledge to real-life clinical situations such as asthma, alcohol intoxication, and the effects of inhalants. They also learned about various clinical role groups and some of the tools used in emergent clinical situations. the heart of innovationA cut above As chaplain for the MGH Cancer Center, Katrina Scott, MDiv, BCC, is well versed in supporting the spiritual needs of patients throughout their cancer experience. \"I've come to appreciate the special circumstances of living with the limitations of illness while trying to keep a sense of self,\" she says. \"For a patient undergoing chemotherapy, losing their hair\u2014particularly for a woman\u2014can be a trying experience.\" As a personal tribute to her patients, Scott grows and donates a ponytail that will be made into a wig for a cancer patient. Above, at right, she prepares for a new \"do,\" courtesy of Erin Evers, a stylist in the Cancer Center's Images Boutique. It's her third time making the pilgrimage. Scott says, \"It's a gift to myself really, just knowing that a patient who otherwise might not be able to afford a wig will have one, along with the restored sense of dignity and self that comes with that.\" Interdisciplinary collaboration Nine different clinical disciplines comprise Patient Care Services. Leveraging the diversity of expertise, experience and perspective of each is a critical element in providing high-quality care, particularly during times of great change. This year's launch of a PCS Interdisciplinary Staff Advisory Committee was designed to provide a forum for communication among PCS leadership and clinicians and enhance interdisciplinary collaboration and discussions. In an effort to inform and be informed by staff, the work of the committee is guided by several key principles: to provide a routine and ongoing forum for PCS staff to identify issues important to their practice to provide a forum for communication about organizational changes affecting PCS staff and patient care to promote and invigorate interdisciplinary collaboration and effectiveness in patient care, education, research, and community outreach, and to further engage staff in initiatives that promote and sustain regulatory readiness, also referred to as Excellence Every Day. To further complement this work, where they did not previously exist, several departments have formed their own discipline-specifi c advisory committees. 31Rebuilding On October 7, 2012, MGH performed its fi rst hand transplantation. The patient, Joseph Kinan, was a burn survivor of the tragic Rhode Island Station Nightclub fi re. Joe sustained burns over more than 40 percent of his body, including losing the fi ngers on his dominant left hand, and his right hand was so severely damaged, he was left with only a shortened thumb. Joe had to rely on others to help him with daily activities. Occupational therapy (OT) would play a critical role in Joe's postop success, and preparations began many months in advance of his surgery. The outpatient OT staff conducted extensive literature reviews, researched and contacted other facilities in the country that had worked with hand transplant patients, and developed task force teams. These teams focused on the specifi c areas of care Joe, and others to follow, would require: protective motion, splints to both protect repaired structures and aid in functional motion. They also focused on possible use of various modalities, sensory re-education and functional retraining. Based on their fi ndings and their collective experience working with replanted digits and limbs, the OT teams developed protocols to address all aspects of care, beginning the day after the transplant to present day and based on healing stages of bone, tendon, nerves, and blood vessels. One of the keys was constant, essential collaboration between the medical team, OTs, other care providers, Joe, and his fi anc\u00e9, Carrie, to ensure a successful rehabilitation. This meant engaging Joe in his daily therapy and having him immediately begin to use his transplanted left hand as his own. By performing basic, repetitive movements, slowly and methodically\u2014through cortical retraining\u2014Joe began to regain his motor skills. Joe's procedure and rehabilitation were about improving his quality of life. If you see Joe and Carrie walking hand in hand down a hallway at MGH\u2014something they weren't able to do before\u2014you know he's on the right path. the heart 32of innovationINTERVENTION SPOTLIGHT Patient & Family Notebook The caregiving process at MGH revolves around the patient and his or her family. Engaging patients and families more directly in their care can ensure they are receiving the best treatment and attention possible. The Patient & Family Notebook was designed to encourage patients and families to actively participate in the care they are receiving. Given to the patient and family at admission, the notebook introduces them to the Innovation Unit they are staying on, shares a Universal Patient Compact, provides an overview of the patient's care team, and offers space for key information and questions to be noted and reviewed. \"The notebook helps orient patients and families to both the unit and the care team,\" says Jean Stewart, RN, MSN BC, attending nurse on the White 6 Orthopaedic Unit, \"and it gives them a great place to take notes and write down questions they might have for the team.\" Some patients have used the notebook at home to document their progress, providing important clinical information when they return for follow-up appointments. Anabela Nunes, MBA, was appointed director of Medical Interpreter Services in March 2012. Since joining the MGH community in 2000, she has been an active fi gure in various leadership roles in Interpreter Services, serving as the manager since 2007. Anabela has been an innovator in the fi eld of medical interpreting at MGH through her participation in the creation of a real-time, web-based scheduling system for the department, and by helping to create I-POPs (Interpreter Phone on a Pole), and V-POPs (Video Phone on a Pole) to facilitate the hospitalwide use of professional medical interpreters. She is dedicated to ensuring that Limited English Profi cient and Deaf and Hard of Hearing patients receive equitable, quality and safe care, positioning MGH as a national leader. Anabela has likewise been a driving force in promoting the national certifi cation of medical interpreters, with an unparalleled 78 percent of MGH staff interpreters earning this distinction. 33Cancer Resource Room Caring HeadlinesCenter for Global HealthChild ProtectionClinical Support ServicesHAVEN Program (Helping Abuse and Violence End Now) Information AmbassadorsInternational Patient CenterLadies Visiting Commi tt eePatient Care Services Programs Retail Shops MGH Quit Smoking ServicePatient AdvocacyOrthotics and ProstheticsPatient and Family LodgingPCS Diversity ProgramPCS Management Systems and Financial PerformancePCS Clinical InformaticsPCS O ce of Quality & Safety Volunteer Services The Institute for Patient Care Center for Innovations in Care Delivery Maxwell & Eleanor Blum Patient and Family Learning Center Norman Knight Nursing Center for Clinical &Professional Development Yvonne L.
