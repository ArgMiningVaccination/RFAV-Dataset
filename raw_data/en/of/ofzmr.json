Background:The [COVID-19 vaccines]were developed unprecedentedly and have proven safe and efficacious in reducing transmissibility and severe [infection]. The impact with a CIED between 2010-20 were utilized to identify recipients of one or more doses of the [COVID-19 vaccine]in 2021. Those [who]had [influenza] [vaccination]in 2020 were also identified in the same cohort as a control. From [remote monitoring]data, the number of atrial high rate events (AHR) and % burden of AA in the three months post- [vaccination]was compared to the preceding three months using Wilcoxon signed rank test. Kruskal-Wallis test was used for group difference comparisons. New AF [diagnosis]was determined from [ICD-10] [diagnosis] [codes]in [Medicare]claims. 47% Moderna, and 3% J&J) were administered CIED (age 76.2 (+/-9.0) 49% [males]), respectively. In cohort, 4723 (61%) individuals received the [influenza vaccine]. A statistically significant increase in the number of AHR episodes and % burden of AA was noted in the three months post- [vaccination]compared to the preceding three months after the 1st and 2nd doses of the [COVID-19 vaccine](Figure). No such [association]was noted following [influenza] [vaccination]. In subgroup [analysis], AHR significantly in [age groups]>70 and [men]. Post- [vaccination]increase in AHR episodes was more significant in those without a pre- [vaccination] [history]of AHR episodes (mean increase of AHR 6.9+/-88.4, p<0.001) and was non-significant in those with a preceding AHR (p=0.8). Among the 764 [patients]with no preceding 87 (11.4%) developed a new AF [diagnosis]or AHR event in the first three months post- [vaccination]. Conclusion(s) We [report]a small but significant number of CIED-detected atrial arrhythmias following [vaccination]for COVID-19 but not [influenza], specifically [men]and age >70 years. Acknowledging the immense [public health]benefit of [COVID-19 vaccines], our results should prompt increased [awareness]of evaluating for in this Similares MEDLINE ... LILACS LIS "}
