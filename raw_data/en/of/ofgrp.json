Chair Pennell then read Item 2, the only item on the agenda and asked Julia Peek, Deputy Administrator of the Nevada Division of Public and Behavioral Health to present Item 2. 2. - Item for Possible Action - Consideration and Possible Adoption of Proposed Emergency Statement and Emergency Regulation Amendment of Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) 441A.755, relating to university, community college and state college students providi ng proof of immunity to certain communicable diseases, including COVID -19. - Julia Peek , Deputy Administrator, Nevada Division of Public and Behavioral Health (DPBH) . Chair Pennell called on Ms. Peek to present agenda item 2. Good morning, Chair Pennell, and members of the Board of Health. My name is Julia Peek for the record, and I serve as a Deputy Administrator for Nevada's Division of Public and Behavioral Health. I wanted to start by thanking you all for your time and for scheduling an additional mee ting to consider the emergency regulation in front of you today. I am joined today by many members of our immunization team, as well as our colleagues within the Nevada System of Higher Education or NSHE which I will refer to NSHE going forward. As you ar e aware, the Board of Health must approve agency regulations before they take effect with the force of law. The proposed emergency regulations would require COVID vaccines for higher education students in Nevada. These regulations are brought forth on the advice o f the Governor's Medical Advisory Team. As you know, COVID -19 continues to pose a substantial crisis in Nevada despite the availability of safe and effective COVID -19 vaccines authorized for everyone ages 12 years and older who does not have a medical contraindication. Vaccination is the most effective countermeasure to prevent COVID -19. The changes and addition of COVID -19 to NAC 441A.755 will protect students by mitigating the spread of COVID -19 on campus and preventing severe illness, hospita lizations, and deaths among students attending Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE) institutions. Mandating vaccinations in Nevada's universities is nothing new. Section 755 within Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) 441A already notes that a person shall not attend a university until he or she submits to the university proof of immunity to tetanus, diphtheria, measles, mumps, rubella and any other disease specified by this Board. Today, we are asking that you add COVID -19 vaccine to that list and that you also expand that to the NSHE institutions more broadly. I'll now walk through the regulation changes: So, as I mentioned Nevada Revised Statue (NRS) 441A .755 currently lists universities we are now recommending that now include NSHE universities, communi ty colleges, and state colleges. I will now go to section 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 11 or unless excused because of religious belief or medical condition, a person shall not enroll in courses at a university, community college, or stat e college on or after November 1, 2021, unless the person submits to the institution proof of a completed COVID -19 vaccination series. We go on to continue to modify in the sections to add again NSHE institutions as opposed to just universities. That again would be a university, community college, or state college instead of just universities as it states now. We provide in the last section a definition of what we mean by community college , state college, and institution. 4150 Technology Way, Suite 300 Carson City , Nevada 775- 684- 4200 Fax 775- 687- 7570 dpbh.nv. gov Page 4 of 40 I'll also note that, NSHE employee s are required to be fully vaccinated or complete weekly testing effective this last Monday, August 16th, as a requirement of employment as required by the Governor. With this emergency regulation, this would ensure the NSHE campuses have both vaccinated s tudents and vaccinated or regularly tested staff and faculty. If approved, these regulations would be effective for 120 days and would have to go through a more rigorous public process to be made permanent if health and higher education officials deem it necessary. The emergency COVID- 19 vaccination regulations must be endorsed in writing by Governor Sisolak and then will take effect immediately upon being filed with the Secretary of State. Therefore, on behalf of the Division of Public and Behavioral Heal th we ask that you approve the emergency regulations a s written. With that, Chair, with your approval, I would like to hand off the presentation to my colleague at NSHE, Caleb Cage who serves as NSHE Task Force Co -Chair, Vice Chancellor for Workforce Devel opment and Chief Innovation Officer, Dr. Melody Rose, Chancellor, NSHE, and Regent Cathy McAdoo, Chair, NSHE Board of Regents. Dr. Melody Rose, Chancellor, NSHE, It is my pleasure to be with you this morning. I am joined as you heard by my colleagues who co -chair the COVID Task Force. Mr. Caleb Cage, Vice Chancellor of Work Force Development and Chief Innovation Officer, and my other co- chair Joe Reynolds, General Co unsel of the NSHE system. I want to start my brief remarks this morning by acknowledging that we are all going through a tremendously difficult time. It is with great empathy that I share that we understand at NSHE that this is a vital conversation and an incredibly challenging conversation. I just wish to share for all of those chiming in this morning thr ough public comment and contributing to this dialogue that I very much appreciate what we are all collectively going though. I would like to continue to offer a couple of additional remarks. We here at NSHE have been working faithfully with the CDC (Centers for Disease Control) with the Governor's Office, and with all stake holders at the local and county level since March 20 th, 2020. It has been within our ethic from the beginning of this pandemic to be good collaborators. To make science based decisions and to abide by all government directives. I would also share with you sir, and members of the Board, that I think that we have been extraordinary partners to our broader communities, and we have worked faithfully to offer our expertise; our scientific expertise, our ability to do contact tracing for the br oader community as well as provide vaccines and tests to the larger community. So, we believe we have f aithfully been following all of the regulatory guidelines, the ones that we have had, and so with great care not just for our community but for the communities at large. We are also very grateful to share with you today that we have great faith in the COVI D Task Force which was formed by my predecessor Chancellor Tom Riley. As you know over 100,000 college students are preparing to return to in class learning in the coming days. And more than 15,000 l oyal, and hard working faculty and staff are eagerly awai ting their arrival. As we approach the joyful first days on our college and university campuses we are looking to you at the Board of Health for direction as we continue to strive to keep all safe and all learning in person even as the Delta variant rages. As I have mentioned since the beginning of the pandemic back in March 2020, NSHE has worked collaboratively and faithfully to adhere to all government guidelines and directives. We are following the science at every turn in order to keep all Nevadans safe, and given this loyalty to science, safety and best practice some may wonder why NSHE itself has not imposed student vaccines. The safest and most effective way to insure in person learning and ultimately to stamp out this wicked virus. Our Board of Regents is a caring and dedicated group of officials, and they are eagerly awaiting your direction. The NRS is clear the Nevada State Board of Health is the supreme, and I quote \"is supreme in all administrative health matters relating to the preservation of he alth and the lives of the citizens of this state.\" As the independent body legally tasked with overviewing the vaccine regulations in our state we at NSHE respect your authority and expertise. We request your guidance as it pertains to student vaccinations 4150 Technology Way, Suite 300 Carson City , 775- 684- 4200 Fax 775- 687- dpbh.nv. gov Page 5 of 40 against COVID -19. As I mentioned earlier , as we have since March 2020 , we will faithfully follow and implement the direction you choose today. As you are aware my predecessor Chancellor Tom Riley had the foresight to form an internal Chancellors Task Force to advise him, and now to advise me on our system 's COVID response. That group of professionals which is made up of 19 experts from the academic fields required to manage a pandemic has guided our COVID management for nearly 18 months. On August 4 th that task force unanimously provided me with the recommendation that a COVID -19 vaccine mandate be imposed for all NSHE students at all NSHE campuses. They followed the science and the data and they have recently unanimously advocated for required vaccines. As you know as well the Faculty Senate Chairs, the body elected to represent all NSHE faculty, is in agreement and has submitted public testimony to that effect. The memo should be on the record. I know that I have several regents watching and ob serving this meeting today including Chairwoman McAdoo and I am grateful for their support and their presents. Here to help answer any questions for you are Chief General Counse l Joe Reynolds and Vice Chancel lor Caleb Cage co -chairs of the NSHE COVID Task Force. They would be on deck to answer any technical questions. With that I want to thank you all for your service and your consideration of this critical issue at this critical moment thank you and I yield back to you Mr. Chair. Chair Pennell thanked Dr. Rose and asked if there were any questions from the Board of Health members for Ms. Peek, Dr. Rose, or her colleagues. Chair Pennell did ask Ms. Peek to clarify. The Board of Health received some comments concerning the timing of todays meeting in relati on to the start of classes on Monday; August 23 rd. Just to clarify, is there anything in this emergency regulation that would affect registered students' ability to attend classes starting on Monday. Ms. Peek replied that she would answer then hand it over to Dr. Rose who might be better to answer that as well. The Governor has been clear he does not want it to impact this semester, so students will start next week as noted in the regulations. This would become effective November 1 st. Dr. Rose stated t hat is correct from her understanding as well and we are very grateful to the Governor 's Office for being careful to not affect our fall term enrollment. As you know our students are moving into dorms and preparing for classes coming up on Monday, and we a re eager to welcome them to campus. We look forward to your decision going forward for spring term. Dr. Murawsky asked Ms. Peek. Just to clarify, many of the public comments were related to the vaccine is that it is experimental, my understanding is this vaccine is past the experimental phase and emergency use authorization is not experimental according to the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) it is in use for a specific reason and a safety study had to be presented to get that authorization. Is this cor rect? Ms. Peek stated that Dr. Murawsky is correct. This has emergency use authorization . We expect full approval in the coming months, and so we look forward to that. You are correct it is not experimental. Dr. Murawsky asked Ms. Peek if current regulations requiring the vaccination for university students at this time we are merely adding another vaccination request and expanding the pool for whom that covers. Is that correct ? Ms. Peek replied that yes, that is correct. Dr. Larson state d that she would like to affirm the process of approvals for vaccinations. This vaccine has under gone every single safety and effectiveness study that is required for licensure. It had over 60,000 people participate in the trials which is more than any vac cine we have seen in recent time, and it passed all of them. This is one of the safest vaccines that has ever been produced and it is highly effective. So, I would add to Dr. 4150 Technology Way, Suite 300 Carson City , Nevada 775- 684- 4200 Fax dpbh.nv. gov Page 6 of 40 Murawsky's comments that this is not an experimental vaccine at this point. It ha s gone through full safety. The only thing that is now being looked at is more follow up data. Thank you very much. Chair P ennell asked if there were any more questions from the Board of Health members. Hearing none Chair Pennell opened the public comment period. a) PUBLIC COMMENT Chair Pennell stated that this would be public comment for Item 2 only and reread the action item. Chair Pennell stated that the Board of Health has received many public comments relating to the Clark County School District (CCSD) and this decision does not involve CCSD whatsoever. Chair Pennell reminded the public that there will be time for any general public comment later in the agenda. Chair Pennell reminded the public that comments may b e received by phone, computer, written comment, because of time considerations every caller offering testimony during this period for public comment will be limited to not more than 2 minutes. Board of Health members have received all written comments up u ntil the start of the meeting and they are entered into the record. If you are testifying on your computer you will see a countdown clock. If you testify by phone we will verbally notify you when your time is up. If you continue to testify past your allott ed time your microphone will be muted to allow the next person to participate. Use of obscenities or otherwise behavior which disrupts this meeting to the extent that disorderly conduct is made impractical may result in forfeiture in the opportunity to provide public comment, or you may be removed from this meeting. Mr. Filippi called upon the public for their Board of Health testimonies. Kent Ervin, State President of the Nevada Faculty Alliance, the independent association of faculty at NSHE colleges and universities. We work to empower faculty and our mission is to help students succeed. The safety of our faculty staff and students is paramount. We have also submitted a petition for a safe fall semester with members of the NSHE community. I speak on behalf over 1,261 NSHE faculty, staff, and family members statewide who have signed. Vaccinations are the surest and safest way to protect the campus community against toxic harm from COVID -19 and to keep in person c lasses open. According to the Chronical of Higher Education, 741 colleges and universities nationwide have mandated vaccinations. We are counting on the Board as the public medical and health professionals to analyze the data and consider the necessity of vaccinations among students and faculty that interact within close learning environments. Please ignore the disinformation that seems to be spreading as fast as the virus. We support the proposed exemptions for the medical and religious reasons and for onl ine only enrollment. We respectfully request that you approve the emergency regulation today. We ask NSHE to act promptly to implement it. Along with testing for unvaccinated students as well as staff in the meantime. Thank you for holding this emergency m eeting. Unfortunately, we feel it is already too late to avert major outbreaks on our campuses as COVID cases surge. Personally, I already have 2 students in class who can't attend my first lecture class on Monday. Thank you very much. Mr. Filippi informed the Board that there is a clarification from the Deputy Attorney General's (DAG) office and introduced Ms. Pierron Tackes. Ms. Tackes , DAG. There are significant comments going on in the chat function of this Zoom meeting to the extent that the individuals contributing those comments would like their comments to be on the record. They should be made during the public comment period as Dr. Pennell noted there are two designated comment periods for this meeting. The current public comme nt period is specific to public comments relating to vaccinations for college students, which is presently before the Board. T he second public comment period will 4150 Technology Way, Suite 300 Carson City , Nevada 775- 684- 4200 Fax 775- 687- 7570 dpbh.nv. gov Page 7 of 40 be opened up prior to the adjournment of the meeting is for any other comments that members of the public would like to make. Pranava Moody: Good morning distinguished Board members. Today I come before you as a disabled veteran a William S. Boyd School of Law student, Vice President of the Boyd Law Education and Disability Equal Rights Society and a mother of two Southern Nevada Collage of Law students. I come to you today to advocate on behalf of my children, myself, those members of our community with disabilities and the education rights of us all. I fully support the proposed amendment NAC 441A.755 mandating the COVID -19 vaccine requirement for students that are enrolling in NSHE institutions and NSHE community colleges and state colleges institutions to be governed by the state. All eyes are on you at this point. As it has been pointed out by several offices that it is only per your guidance through the medical and health experts on this Board that a COVID vaccine can be mandated. You are the only agency with the legal authority to enact this mandate , Boyd cannot, UNLV cannot, NSHE cannot. You can. Use your already established legal authority to take care of the health of the higher education students in this state. We all deserve a safe learning environment, and you alone can provide it when it comes to this worldwide pandemic. I ask you to rely on the medical and scientific expertise available to you as well as the legal authority already invested in you to amend NAC 441A.755 as proposed. Do not be persuaded by partisan idolatry created during a state of fear. Do not play with the lives that comprise the future of the state. It is aimless train of thought to keep this vaccine as a voluntary action in combating this pandemic. This will only create a less safe environment for those members of our communi ty that are medically fragile. This is not a partisan issue; this is a community issue. It is time for you to take the necessary step to take care of the entire community and not rely on those members who are willing to be team players and carry that burde n for you. Thank you very much. Zachary Johnigan, Student Body President of the Coll ege of Southern Nevada (CSN), I have been elected to serve the students at CSN . As part of my service, I am the voice of the students. Concerning the mandatory COVID- 19 vaccinations CSN and the student government asked the students in a survey how much do you support a mandate that all students in the NSHE to receive a COVID vaccination. The survey was open for 6 days and 30% of the 9,110 students responded saying \"I do not support a mandate for a mandatory COVID vaccination at all\" while only 33% say they \" support it a great deal \". We also asked \" how much do you support a mandate that requires all students attending any NSHE institution to show that they have proof that they have a COVID vaccination \", 41% of the students surveyed said they have no support for this at all, and 33% said they support this a great deal. This survey received the highest amount of feedback in CSN history. Students should have the right to choose what they put inside their body. That right should not interfere with the ability to pursue higher education that empowers them to achieve, succeed, and prosper. Members of the Nevada State Board of Health you have heard the voice of the students at CSN . Take this voice into consideration when voting on agenda item number 2. Thank you for listening and thank you for your service to our shared community. Conzello Barnhill III, I am confused because you guys keep saying that you trust the science, but all the science reports that I have seen on Johnson and Johnson, Pfizer, and Moderna. They specifically target the spike protein it doesn't introduce the whole genomic structure of the virus, so people who get the vaccine are still able to get the virus , and there is evidence that there is a viral loa d that is in people who have it a symptomatic symptoms. It is kind of ridiculous what you are saying, and I would like for you to stop misinforming the public. Because it is disrespectful to the public because you are misconstruing science by looking at statistics and adding your own interpretation. . People have rights to their own bodies and I am deeply against this mandate. Especi ally because 4150 Technology Way, Suite 300 Carson City , Nevada 775- 684- 4200 Fax 775- 687- 7570 dpbh.nv. gov Page 8 of 40 the structure that you are citing specifically lists for immunization. You are not immune to this virus once you get the vacci ne, it does not provide immunity. You are playing a little game of your antibodies blocking the spike protein and trying to stop the spike protein from attaching to your cells and injecting the viral load from the proximity. It is ridiculous that you keep saying . That is basically what I wanted to say. And also, I am getting tired of this emotional rhetoric attached to i t. You must understand we are dictating these people's lives. My ability to pursue education is at the hands of whether I get this vaccine or not. It is kind of ridiculous, how do you support the science, you completely neglect all other aspects besides comprehensive . Xeloria (NLN), I am an incoming junior at UNLV, and I am against the mandating of the COVID -19 vaccinatio n for students and in general. The main reasons for the COVID vaccine has been recommended, and mandated in some states so we can reach herd immunity and prevent the spread of the virus as fast as we can. However , recent events in several states, such as in Massachusetts , having over 12,000 vaccinated individuals testing positive to the COVID virus to Iceland having a recent COVID outbreak where over 80% . The cases being reported to be from vaccinated individuals. Indicating herd immunity through these vac cinations will never be possible. The COVID vaccination has been reported to c urb severe side effects of COVID upon contraction. However, this means unbeknownst asymptomatic care for this virus will likely increase . Recent studies done by the CDC even suggests that the viral for the vaccinated and unvaccinated indicating that both parties are equally contributing to the spread of the virus. In regard to the side effects of the vaccine, initially when the COVID vaccine was being rolled out there was no warni ng about st rokes, blood clots, and being permanently disabled. This was never talked about, but later discovered through individuals according to their own experiences and confirming of their legitimacy. This goes to show that we are in a learning process of potential dangers with this new type of vaccine, and only time will tell. Case in point the EU (European Union) is looking into possible side effects including but not limited to nursing multi -form, kidney inflammation, and exotic syndrome, with the slim likelihood of stopping COVID even with a vaccination, with the potential side effects still being researched. Mandating the vaccine is not ethical, nor is it humane. As a matter of fact, it is quite discriminatory. Even if the vaccine were to hel p with potential side effects of the virus itself, it is up to the discretion of many without jeopardizing their career, education, or lively hood. Especially, because the spread of the virus is not limited to the unvaccinated. Especially when the vaccine administrators are no t held accountable for bodily harm if there were any due to taking this vaccine. Ariana Brockman, Student at the University of Nevada. I would like to start off by asking you all some questions. First of all, why mandate a vaccine th at has a 99. 983% survival rate. If the vaccine works, then why does it matter who receives it or not. Those who protect themselves may take it although taking the vaccine does not protect others as even as the White House omitting it is possible to contrac t and spread COVID, so why mandate it ? How about instead of brushing off all of our questions as misinformation you actually try to answer us. All of the arguments in favor of the adding the COVID vaccine to the list of mandated vaccines when the precedents have been set as other vaccines are required to attend the universities. For all those arguments are based upon the same flaws and I would like to bring them to your attention. First of all, those vaccin es that are mandated have full FDA approval. It has been available for many years and have long term studies done to evaluate their safety, effectiveness, and side effects. Also, all of the required vaccines cultivated a live attenuated strain of the virus , it is a weakened form of the virus . Whereas the COVID vaccine is an mRNA vaccine which has never been used or successful until now. Lastly the adverse effect that is required by other vaccines are much lower than for the COVID vaccines. This is coupled w ith the fact that the death rates for other vaccines is much higher, and thus more of a threat than COVID. As it stands now this vaccine is an experimental drug that does not have full FDA approval. Never in history has any sort of drug or medication 4150 Technology Way, Suite 300 Carson City , Nevada 775- 684- 4200 Fax 9 of 40 witho ut FDA approval has been mandated or required. It is under an Emergency Use Authorization only. Along that same train of thought let's talk about disability of COVID because I don't think it warrants an emergency, the threat of COVID is 0.017% . In other wo rds, this translates into 99.983% survival rate I got these numbers off of the CDC website, so you can pull them up and do the math if you don't believe me. As a student at the University of Nevada , Reno, I urge you to leave the decision whether or not to take the COVID vaccine up to every individual student. A decision that should remain private . Samantha (NLN), I have submitted written comment, but I will also read it for the record. I would like to state that I am in opposition of mandating for students who are attending Nevada State colleges or universities. For the main reason that many students do not feel comfortable with this vaccine yet. Mainly because it does not have full FDA approval yet outside emergency use. It doesn't prevent the spread of the virus since vaccinated individuals can still contract and spread the virus. Most of the time unknowingly due to the lack of symptoms. The flu vaccine has never been required for admission even though it kills thousands of people a year and we don't know yet the short or long- term effects of this vaccine. Additionally, my child and I are attending online only and have zero desire to step foot on the campus due to our busy work and my schedule obligations. Especially now that we learned last year how we can effectively execute all services and needs online. My son has full scholarships to local schools and to think he will lose that, and we will have to go out of state for our education, if this pass is not only devastating but also very unjust. We shouldn't have to choose between protecting ourselves and making decisions about our own body to get an education. I see that staff has been given the option to test weekly and that should at least be an option for students as well. Although testing should be for everyone considering we discovered fully vaccinated people are carrying the virus and are a - symptomatic. At the rate it will never go away. I am disappointed that we are making rash decisions that are not based on true evidence and research and actively effective in reducing this disease, but rather just controlling people. Relying on a vaccine that still spreads the disease more rapidly, instead we avoid actually getting our population healthy to improve their immune system, so that they can actually beat this disease. Thank you. Carson Terr y, I wanted to talk about COVID and COVID deaths by age group. In the world the COVID cases from 18 to 29 year -old is 6,600,000 and the survival rate is less than 1% at .6%. If you look at almost any college. I specifically chose CSN student census to look at, but the majority of students are from 18 to 29 years - old, so they are in that group. They are in the group that is most likely to survive COVID. I also wanted to ask if the vaccine is mandated what other options are there for students because an online class, which I have taken many, do not offer any student professor interaction, other than emails which is not helpful in most classes. I have not taken any remote learning class where you are able to do this, like a Zoom call with classes. I have heard that they are almost as ineffective as just online class where you are handed a test book and assignments which I was taking Math 132 and I couldn't do it by myself. It is like learning rocket science alone, it's not possible. My question to you is what ot her options are there for people who are not going to come into the campus, and I also want to speak about testing, like the previous person was saying, there needs to be testing available instead of the vaccine for students who do not want to get it. Abe Lugo, Student Body Vice President of the UNLV representative to 28,000 students of our community. It is important to note that this amendment, if it is to be implemented, is to the effect and of for these 28,000 students and these 28,000 students alone. Because of this the highest priorities at this moment should be to reflect the needs of these students, particularly students at UNLV. Given the ongoing rising cases of COVID -19 with a daily average of already 1,092, as of yesterday in Las Vegas. The only way of combatting this is by implementing the COVID -19 vaccine. If we do not, nothing at all will be done to combat this disease. The 4150 Technology Way, Suite 300 Carson City , Nevada 775- 684- 4200 Fax 775- 687- 7570 dpbh.nv. gov Page 10 of 40 numbers will continue to grow as they already have, we will get shut down once again and countless people, once again will due to the refusal of both mas king up and getting vaccinations. As directly stated from the CDC website, the unvaccinated individuals are twice as likely to be reinfected with COVID -19 than those who are fully vaccinated after initially contracting the virus. Moreover, the intended position for Congress and the United States Supreme Court predicted early in this pandemic that 70,000,000 to 100,000,00 United States residents would contract COVID -19 a 1% mortality rate as stated previously in other comments at that scale of infection it is worth noting that between 700,000 and 1.5 million. David Orentlicher , Professor at UNLV, Boyd School of Law and Director of the UNLV Health Law Program, I speak today in strong support of the proposed regulation w ith one change to speed up its implementation. I have submitted written comments on behalf of my self and over 35 of my law faculty colleagues . One of the most important things that we do for our students is to foster a sense of community. Indeed, the miss ion statement for UNLV is as follows \"Our mission is for UNLV's diverse faculty, students, staff, and alumni to promote community wellbeing\" right now the most important thing we can do to promote the wellbeing of our college and university communities is to limit the spread of COVID. And make sure that our campuses are safe spaces for students, staff, faculty, and visitors. And while we are grateful for current COVID precautions we need widespread immunization to adequately protect our students and importa ntly with whom they interact. Whether at home or on campus. Vaccination is by far the most effective tool to prevent infection, hospitalization, and death. We understand the concern about giving people notice and students have been enrolled, but we are in a public health emergency, and it is essential that we act quickly given the long standing availability of vaccines and the severe nature of the COVID threat it is fair, and it is vital to move quickly, more specifically with the plentiful opportunities for immunization we believe it is appropriate to require the first dose by August 27 th thank you very much for your consideration. Cameron (NLN) , To be clear I am not anti -vaccination in general. Having said that I firmly believe that mandating vaccines to attend NSHE institutions is wrong. To me this proposal sets a dangerous precedent where in the government and other institutions can regulate our bodies by denying opportunities for higher education on the principal of non- compliance. The government and l ocal institutions do not, I repeat, do not have autonomy over our bodies. I firmly believe that most people including the vaccine hesitant are just trying to do the right thing. Members of the Nevada community have taken excellent strides in complying with the masking mandates, and the testing mandates. But masks and testing are non- invasive I have learned that it is incredibly important to learn history, so you are not doomed to repeat it. Our for fathers built this country to be suspicious of institutions and the government. They didn't want people to have to feel unsafe in their own country. And the fact of the matter is that the vaccine has not been authorized for full use from the FDA. That is fact. Getting people to inject something into their own bodi es without knowing the long- term reproductions is not ok. We have been told the vaccine is safe. The fact of the matter is we do not know. In the 1960's thalidomide was prescribed to pregnant women to help with morning sickness, this was done experimentally and under emergency use, but the fact of the matter is when those children came into term 9 months later their bodies were marred. We do not know what the consequences are because there has not been sufficient time to regulate this. Thank you. Katherine E. Kelly, of Delta Toxicology. I am a practicing toxicologist in Nevada with a doctorate in public health from Columbia and undergrade Stanford, back when that actually meant something, as a dedicated public health professional. I am here to say for the record that a cold hard look at the risks . The cost and the benefits of vaccinations and masks on students and their teachers with all that we know today leads to the inescapable 4150 Technology Way, Suite 300 Carson City , Nevada 775- 684- 4200 Fax 775- 687- 7570 dpbh.nv. gov Page 11 of 40 conclusion that the harm of doing so greatly outweighs the benef its. That's the type of analysis I was trained to do, and I would hope State Health Department staff are trained as well to not to make important health policy decisions any other way. The d ata simply does not justify intervention for a long list of reasons that 2 minutes can't possibly address. I have lived long enough to know that history will not look kindly at many of the public health decisions that have been made in the last couple of years. And I feel that those who are making public health policy de cisions affecting our kids be based on anything other than hard data will fair the worst. This is the time to be encouraging our youth to be confident, resourceful, independent individuals that will help our country to get back on track and flourish and not compromise their youth with unsound indefensible interventions. Please be accountable to the standards of our profession. Let the schools and campuses get back to the business of educating our kids. Thank you. Austin Kight, Concerned citizen and parent . As of August 16 th, 2021, the CDC reported that the norm ethnicity of at least one dose of the vaccine was nearly 2/3rds white people at 58% as opposed to minorities at 10% Black, 17% Hispanic, and 6% Asian. Mandating the COVID vaccination for students attending Nevada college campuses is an obvious attempt to systematic ally discriminate against minorities and suppress their right to education. Nevada colleges should be striving for inclusive policies that make that make the opportunity for education to all thereby fostering a more equitable society for all. Instead, they are covertly leveraging this pandemic to suppress minorities. And yes the right to a higher education is underlined by unequal factors such as funding, resources, quality teachers, and class sizes. Society turns a blind eye to these dramatically different learning opportunities and takes the view that if the student doesn't achieve it is their own fault. We can not take this vaccine. There are deeply ingrained fears and beliefs of minorities surrounding health care that are based on atrocious acts such as the Tuskegee Study to name just one. You claim to base your decisions in science, but science has no definitive answer on how long the vaccine is effective. According to the CDC vaccinated people are capable of spreading the virus. In fact, a vaccinated person poses the same risk as unvaccinated people. In reality you are using fear and public health policy to justify denying minorities the right to a higher education. Segregation in sports has had lasing implications resulting in wide disparities between whites and minorities for generations after it ended. This will be no different. You are not condemning minorities today for a lack of education, you are ensuring a lack of inequality for generations to come. For the record I oppose mandating the vaccine in any capacity. Gregory Brown, Professor at UNLV. I am speaking in support of this measure with many of my colleagues, students, and community members who have advocated for this for months dating back to last spring. It has taken this long while nearly 1,000 institutions and systems across the country have acted is highly problematic for our state and our system and the consequence of this delay is that the policies drafted would not take affect during the fall semester, amidst the delta surge. Which raises serious concerns about the public health situation in our classrooms starting next week. The reason for this delay is a concern that seems to be very reasonable that we want a quote \"fair and responsible timeframe\" but that fails to meet the urg ency of the public health crisis. Delta is not interested in fair and responsible. I'd like to quote from two of our state leaders. Which suggest that we should in the interest of public health put this policy in plac e immediately. Chancellor Rosen on May 7 th, 2021 said \"I fully support the implementation of a mandatory COVID -19 vaccine for our students. Our students cannot afford further disruptions to their education if the virus is allowed to spread unabated. Which continues to be a concern, especially i n the colder months. Students and their families should prepare for the possibility of a mandate for the fall 2021 semester:\" Governor Sisolak this past Monday; August 16th, 2021 \"To all higher education students, if you have not yet done so, I encourage t hose who plan to return for in person learning to get your COVID -19 vaccination before returning to campus.\" I urge the Board therefor to modify 4150 Technology Way, Suite 300 Carson City , Nevada 775- 684- 4200 Fax 775- 687- 7570 dpbh.nv. gov Page 12 of 40 the proposed regulation and implement it with an effective date of September 7th, 2021. That would give unvacci nated students sufficient time to receive their first shot, or if they choose to seek a refund. Dawn Rickabaugh, I am just very concerned about this. I have kids that are college age, and I am deeply opposed to this. It is just astounding to me that the people who are supposedly our leaders and our science people and our health commissioners. You know if it was science, this is like propaganda. Science is never settled. Science, true s cience, and not a religion. You are paying attention to things that are coming out such as the FDA recently warned against neurological disorders that are being associated with the vaccination. Ok, we will do online courses do you know now with this whole narrative that in Connecticut now any unvaccinated students are being blocked from using the internet. So, we can see that it is much more about science . This is some perverse, very perverse agenda that is going on and I would hold each one of you personal ly accountable. I would sue each one of you for any harm that comes from this. It's absolutely disgusting. There has been more adverse reaction to this so- called vaccine, when its not even really a vaccine, in 1 year than all the other vaccines put togethe r. It is just unfathomable to me. The lack of clear thinking and the lack of dedication to the values that made this country great. And you need to stop. I would definitely, you just wait, lots and lots of law suites coming. Don't do this. Thank you. Daph ne Lee, I wrote all of you for the record and sent science behind the naturally immune. It is horribly wrongful to be indiscriminately vaccinating people when the vaccine was never tested on people who were naturally immune. Anyone can go onto clinicaltria ls.gov and read the exclusion and inclusion data. Anyone who has been exposed or had COVID already they were excluded from the safety data. Now they are indiscriminately vaccinating people who are already immune, and I sent you all this scientific literatu re that says that people who have already contracted COVID have complete and robust immunity. I do not understand why our scientific people are ignoring this. Its not right. My son's doctor told him that he is immune and that he does not need this vaccine and as we are seeing with the coming booster shots in September the vaccine is failing. It is a leaky vaccine, and it does not provide complete immunity, so this whole farse that it is going to stop the spread, its not. Look at Israel right now they are on e of the most completely immunized nations and they are having a crisis right now. I don't understand. You guys keep telling us to follow the science. We are, we are looking at what is going on right now and these vaccines are failing. So, to put this on t he youth who are not at risk, especially when many of them are naturally immune and you're not even giving people the chance to test for anti- bodies beforehand. Frankly its completely irresponsible and there is nobody who is going to be held accountable wh en these young people are injured or have heart inflammation or blood clots. We already have an 18 year -old in Henderson who had blood clots, their family was left with hundreds of thousands of dollars in hospital bills. Who is going to pay when our childr en get hurt. I want to know. Thank you. Naseem As emeenkell, I want to give public comment in support of this mandate. I am quite disgusted by the comments of my students. Speaking of how forcing a vaccination could jeopardize education of your peers, my fellow students is ignorant and close minded. You do not consider how jeopardized the education has been by idol action this past year. I encourage the Board to mandate a vaccination because it is the only way to move forward from this pandemic. Short and s weet, I do not want to take much of your time, I very much apricate the Board's time today and everyone who gave public comment I thank you. Have a good rest of your day. I do disagree with quite a bit of you though. Stay tuned for the rest, Thank you. Adam Hurd, UNR Student and U.S. Air Force veteran. I am what the business types would call a \"stakeholder\" in this. I want to address what the Board was bringing up earlier. The argument was made that this is just one 4150 Technology Way, Suite 300 Carson City , Nevada 775- 684- 4200 Fax 775- 687- 7570 dpbh.nv. gov Page 13 of 40 more vaccine to be added to the list. Its not really a vaccine it is gene therapy. It is modifying your DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) to produce a spike protein but setting all that aside they say this is just one more on the list. Well, let me put that into context by looking at the other vacci nes. The Tdap (tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis) vaccine was first combined in 1948. The MMR, measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine was combined in 1968. Those pre -date the Korean War and the moon landing respectively. They have a much, much longer track record than this so- called vaccine which has been out for less than a year. And if you look at the development timeline the average vaccine development, according to the National Institute of Health is about 10 years. They di d this in less than a year. How is that possible. I don't really care what the FDA said that they followed every single step. You can't cheat time. Where are the long term studies on this. We have no idea what the long term effect. In fact, CNN (Cable News Network) September 1 st, 2020, wrote this article and I quote \"Past vaccine disasters show why rushing a Corona vaccine now would be colossally stupid\" and more facts for you. The 1955 Cutter incident 40,000 got polio during a vaccine distribution. 1976 sw ine flu, they had to stop that after too many people got Guillain- Barre Syndrome. Don't do this. Thank you. Sandra Kourik, I would like to start this off by stating that I am a member of the College of Southern Nevada Student Government Henderson Campus S enator. This is due to college attendance being contingent upon taking a non- FDA approved vaccine the right of the person to accept or deny medical care on the individual level. Between the two there is a boundary. That boundary is, not a single institution should have the power to leverage a student's education against their own individual health care decision. This consequence of going beyond the boundary is breaching a student's rights to accept or deny medical treatment that only exists between a studen t and their health care provider. Many people may be unaware that NRS 449A.112 gives every medical patient in Nevada the right to refuse treatment. I consider this vaccine for COVID as a treatment. As hospitals, doctors' office, medical providers, or any other health care professional must be given consent by the patient for medical treatment. The Nevada Board of Health has been actively by passing that consent by issuing this vaccine mandate for every student in NSHE attendance. That is all I think I have to say on this issue. We students have the right to decide medical treatment, whether we want this vaccine or not. Christopher Stead, I oppose the vaccine mandate because no one knows what the long term effects of the vaccine are. This is why it is under an Emergency Use Authorization. Which authorization gives everyone the option to accept, refuse administration in whole or in part under Title 21 USC (United States Code) Section 360, so at this point we have an unapproved drug that is being sourced upon people if this vaccine mandate is allowed to go fourth. Even if the FDA approved the drug experienced and independent physicians would recommend not to take a new drug approved by the FDA for 7 years, so that evidence can accumulate about its real harms and benefits. I would believe that if the Board goes forward with this vaccine mandate the y would be violating federal law, at least under the EUA (Emergency Use Authorization). Thank you. Heidi Parker, E xecutive Director of Immunize Nevada. First , I would like to thank our public health leadership and our Board of Health members for your service and for continuing to protect the health of Nevadans in all of our communities across the state. You have worke d overtime during this pandemic to reduce the pain and suffering of Nevadans and it is appreciated by many. The arrival of COVID -19 vaccines brought great hope in Nevada against this pandemic that has affected our way of life for nearly a year and a half. Now more than 7 months into this largest vaccination effort that we have seen in history. The data and science are clear. The vaccines are safe, t hey are effective, and they are saving lives. History also shows us precedent, in 1905 the Supreme Court in Jacobson vs. Massachusetts upon the principal of self defense of paramount necessity a 4150 Technology Way, Suite 300 Carson City , Nevada 775- 684- 4200 Fax 775- 687- 7570 dpbh.nv. gov Page 14 of 40 community has the right to protect itself against an epidemic of disease which threatens the safety of its members. Over 700 campuses and counting across the U.S. ha ve announced some type of COVID -19 vaccination requirements and we applaud Nevada for this proposed Emergency Regulation and for protecting the health, the safety of higher education students, staff, and faculty across all of our campus communities. The continued spread of the virus and arrival of new variants is an urgent reminder that this pandemic is not over yet and vaccination is the best and most ef fective way to protect our state. Peter Yong, in the western tradition higher education has been associated with expansion of our freedom. For example, in an age where kings and priests attempted to censor the philosophers of the enlightenment rallied under the injunction \" Sapere Aude \" or dare to know in Latin. For these philosophers to be truly educated was not merely to reiterate approved opinions: #sa feandeffective, #trustthescience, but to have the capacity and courage to think for yourself. Unfortunately, these values are now under assault on all fronts. Students' self - censor afraid of being reported for \"microaggressions\" or \"wrong think\" and even f aculties fear cancellation. Facts have yet the uprooting of autonomy has not yet been complete for though they might stifle their speech students and faculty could still choose what was allowed within their own bodies. This small flicker of freedom is now about to be extinguished. This is the choice that confronts you today, and I fear that if you choose wrongly and give the university a final shove into the abyss of totalitarianism the consequences of your decision will be complete and irrevocable. Will yo u expel the last shreds of autonomy from higher education. Will the motto of future students be not \" Sapere Aude \", think for yourself, but obey without question, or more accurately abandon hope ye who enter here. Thank you for your time. Zoe Chamberlin, I would like to say just firstly that the federal law prohibits any mandate of the COVID -19 vaccine as unlicensed Emergency Use Authorization only vaccines in Sub- section b, ( b), b 3e 1a Section 23 Section 30 Title 21 of the United States Code (USC) otherwise known as the Emergency Use Authorization section of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act. It demands everyone employees and students alike the option to accept or refuse the COVID -19 vaccine. I can put a link in the comments section. On Sub- section 2 conditioning and continued employment or education upon participating in a medical experiment and demanding dis closure of private personal medical information may also create employer or institution liability. Under federal and state laws including HIPPA , (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) FMLA, (Family Medical Leave Act) and applicable state and tort principals including torts prohibiting prescribing invasions of privacy and battery. Indeed, any employer or institution mandating the vaccine will be liable to their employees for adverse event suffered by the employee or student and this comes from OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) . This is my body, and this is my choice. I do not agree with you trying to force me to get this vaccine and it is not fair that my education could be at forfeit. That I do not get to finish my degree next semester because I do not wish to put this into my body. I ask that you give us the opportunity to test weekly, or to be able to opt -out of getting this. I hope you realize how much money these schools are going to lose if you decide to implement this. Thank you. Kim Benke, Why do we need an experimental vaccine for a virus that we have a 99.98% chance of surviving. More and more evidence is pouring in from around the world that raises doubts about the safety and efficacy of this vaccine. According to the UK (United Kingdom) based E vidence B ased M edicine Consultancy Group which submitted their findings to Britain's Department of Health doctors from England are calling for a complete cessation of the use of COVID vaccines on humans. They are claiming quote \"There is more than enough evidence to declare that the COVID vaccine is unsafe for use in humans.\" Doctors say after examining official public health records they have a number of admitted side effects from the vaccine including bleeding 4150 Technology Way, Suite 300 Carson City , Nevada 775- 684- 4200 Fax 775- 687- 7570 dpbh.nv. gov Page 15 of 40 and clotting, unexpected immune system reactions, unusual pain reacti ons, neurological responses, l oss of sight, hearing, speech, or smell are adverse reactions effecting pregnancy including miscarriage. Researchers explain that the products in the vaccine are toxic to humans. According to the VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System) website, a U.S. Government site that tracks adverse reactions to vaccines nearly 6,000 people have died as a result of taking this vaccine. Some 20,000 more have been hospitalized. Nearly 2,000 others have come down with Bell's Palsy and 44,000 have checked themselves into urgent care. That's not to mention the 5,900 life threatening reactions people have had directly from receiving the vaccine. Including 2,200 people who have suffered heart at tacks as a result of getting this injection. Over 650 women have suffered miscarriages, and 4,500 people are disabled, some permanently. These numbers are growing greater than all of the other side effects of all the other vaccines in the entire world comb ined. This is not normal. But, then again, this is not a normal vaccine. It is experimental. This past week president Joe Biden gave his staff the options to whether they wanted to vaccinate or not and as students we deserve the same consideration. The sta te has the power to stop this, so please stop this governmental overreach of power and control over our lives. Leann McAl lister, Executive Director of the Nevada Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) . The Nevada A AP has 265 members most of whom are board certified pediatricians in both primary and specialty care. Members also include pediatric nurse practitioners, physician assistants, pediatric residents, and medical students. All of whom work and live in Nevada a nd have dedicated their professional lives to the health of all children. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all individuals 12 and older receive COVID- 19 vaccinations as medically indicated. The COVID -19 vaccine is the best way to protect children and teens from COVID -19 including the Delta variant. AAP recommends everyone get the vaccine as soon as they are eligible. Vaccines are safe and effective and among the most studied medication that we give. Vaccines are much safer for children and young adults than the diseases they pre vent. The number one concern of any pediatrician is simple. It is the health and wellbeing of children. Nevada AAP members know that immunizations keep children healthy. That is why pediatricians vaccinate their own children and that is why the Nevada AAP urges parents to vaccinate their children. Thank you. Burke Layne, thank you for the opportunity to speak. I say no to adding COVID -19 shots to vaccination series. One, because of unknowns, misinformation and frankl y the overwhelming push for the jab and zero talk of adverse reactions. Let's start with COVID -19 itself. There is no isolated and purified viable sample given to a lab for the CDC for testing. Another point is that the shot is not proven to prevent transm ission or aid in heard immunity. A recent study found vaccinated people can carry the same amount of virus as the unvaccinated. Ask yourself, why are there only studies of the shot results of people never having COVID -19. Where is the study of possible ris ks to individuals having antibodies and receiving the shot. There is no study that has evidence of antibodies don't protect individual's long term. There are trial studies that cause me to pause. One with 40,000 and another with 30,000 but they only use the results of 370 for their inclusion, why is that. On the vaccine bottle itself it states \"unknown whether shot has impact on fertility\" really? It is unknown but yet you want to mandate it. A Pfizer study shows that a decrease of fertility in rats at 16%. We are the trial. This is not approved. Keep that in mind. Like so many people said over 99.98% people 20 to 49 have survivability. The media as a whole has dismissed any adverse events and deaths only pushing shame on the unvaccinated. How is it mandated and forced on citizens, yet countless people from the border are allowed around our country without one. Shelby Benson, Senior at UNR. In all honesty I don't follow what everyone else has had. I just have a general concern as a student. I have 2 semesters left and in all honesty I'm scared. I am scared of the vaccine and scared 4150 Technology Way, Suite 300 Carson City , Nevada 775- 684- 4200 Fax 775- 687- 7570 dpbh.nv. gov Page 16 of 40 of everything that is going on in this world, a nd I feel that my education is being stolen from me. I am sitting here crying all morning waiting to make my first payment for my second to final semester at UNR. Waiting to see if I am going to lose my education because I am afraid of something that is not entirely safe for me yet. Honestly I could go somewhere else, that i s perfectly fine, but eventually everywhere is going to have the same thing. I understand that there are multiple differing opinions on this, but you are wanting to mandate something for college students. So, when do college students speak. If we feel safe enough we want the vaccine that's fine, take the vaccine. Be safe. If you want it wear your mask, distance yourself, take the steps that you feel are necessary. And still get the education that I feel we all deserve. I feel like as adults as college stude nts we are entirely capable of making that decision ourselves without a mandate. If I want the vaccine than I will take it and if I feel like I am not there yet, or I don't feel safe or I don't want it if feel it is alright as an adult, as a college studen t to be able to sit here and make this decision for myself. Thank you. Remington Vincet Longly, incoming UNLV Senior this fall studying economics and I would like to submit to public record today that I stand in firm support of not mandating this vaccine. I stand with the solid majority of surveyed students who do not support mandating this vaccine. I will cut right to the chase. I am dubious about this. I have not been reading anything very good about it. People have been having adverse reactions to it especially considering all the heart issues people have been having. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine which was pulled off of the ma rket for a little while because people were having issues with blood clotting, bleeding, things like that. People want me to shoot that into my arm just because I want a bachelor's degree. I don't say that as someone who is anti -vax, if you want to get the vaccine get the vaccine, but I also think that you guys should respect the medical freedoms and medical choices of people who say that they don't want to take it. Again, we are in the majority opinion. People who support the vaccine mandate you guys are i n the minority opinion absolutely for sure, as my colleague Zack earlier pointed out. We done surveys on this. The response rate was high. People don't want to get it. The reasons are obvious. People find it sketchy; people don't think that it is very trus tworthy, so no. I think that NSHE and the UNLV Board of Directors need to do the right thing and respect the medical freedom and medical choices of southern Nevada students who say they don't want to get a vaccine that has been around for less than a year. For a virus that has been in public opinion for 2 years. It is time to do the right thing, you guys should not mandate this as people need to respect the choices of our students and with that I will yield my time to the rest of this entire chat who have b een overwhelmingly say they don't want this thing to be mandated. Thank you. Dr. Andrew Pasternak, Family Physician in Reno, Nevada and President Elect of the Nevada State Medical Association (NSMA). NSMA is Nevada's largest physician association who represents physicians in all specialties throughout the state. We want to thank the Board of Public Heath for this meeting today. NSMA is in favor of requiring COVID -19 vaccinations enrolled in Nevada's coll eges and universities. Our recommendations came after a th orough review by our Public Health Committee. These recommendations were unanimously agree d upon by our leadership. As physicians we are on the front lines of seeing how people have been affected by the COVID -19 pandemic and how it has affected so many different people in so many different ways. We also fully realize the importance of getting s tudents back in the classrooms. COVID -19 vaccinations are one of the keys of doing this. I know that there are a lot of concerns about the safety of the COVID vaccines, but I will point out that 96% of physicians have been vaccinated against COVID -19. We u rge you to follow the science and ensure the safety, health, and educational well being of the students of our state. Nevada's response to COVID should be one based in facts and not in political divisions. We will continue to take care of our patients with diligence and compassion. We also ask you to help us show compassion to our job by ensuring college communities in our state are safe. Thank you. 4150 Technology Way, Suite 300 Carson City , Nevada 775- 684- 4200 Fax 775- dpbh.nv. gov Page 17 of 40 Grant Guston, Nevada native and a UNR graduate, class of 2019. Sometimes it is embarrassing to change our minds when new information is presented to us. Especially after stating our opinion on a subject. Maybe some of the Board members have told each other how they intended to vote on this today and they might feel embarrassed to change their mind after hearing the public testimony. However, we are all here to learn and educate ourselves and all of you have been lucky enough to learn a lot of new information today, so here's some statistics I found useful during my research. Frequently what is mentioned is the total number of cases. Total number of cases is simply just that, the total number. It doesn't mean hospitalizations or deaths. The total number of hospitalizations and deaths is much, much, much lower but you hardly hear the number of hospitalizations and deaths mentioned because that number isn't high enough to be sensationalized by the media or anybody else. I support people who decide to get the Coronavirus vaccine for their own personal reasons, but I believe the choice is for each individual person to decide if the vaccine is right for them . And not be left up to a state board mandate. Simply not approving this resolution does not mean you are against vaccines, or you are an \"anti-vaxxer \" all that means is that you believe each individual has a choice to do what is right for them. Melody during your introduction you called the C oronavirus a wicked virus, however, the COVID virus is comparable to a bad flu with mild side effects for which most include a fever and temporary loss of taste and smel l. I would hardly call that a wicked virus. And you also called this a critical issue at a critical moment, but it is anything but. I am currently unvaccinated, and I deal with people face to face all day. I have been doing this for over a year and I have never had Coronavirus. During introductions Julia you mentioned that the vaccine is currently the most effective way to stop the threat of COVID. However, many people who have been vaccinated have been infected with Coronavirus including our mayor Caroline Goodman, who has openly got the virus and she is vaccinated, so it is just crazy. Nour Benjelloun, I am just going to give my comment, not as a CSN senator and community leader , but as a student who is concerned for his health and safety at UNLV. To be quite honest I am disgusted with the comments I have been hearing today from those in my community, from my peers . If you are all concerned about the safety of our students, if you are concerned about it impacting your education then make the smart move an d mandate the vaccine. At UNLV we are quite overdue I believe, and we already are required to have 4-5 vaccines to come here in the first place. The only reason people are getting so envious about this is it has been made critical by the government and politics and everything going on in last few years. And this last year in general you know I am a junior at UNLV a nd I have actually only had one normal in person experience up to this point because everything has been online. You know I've had friends and family who have been impacted by COVID, so hearing all these comments today of being against the vaccine mandate , personally pisses me off , so I urge all of you leaders who are supposed to be taking care of our health to mandate the COVID -19. Alliyah Weaver, I would like to start off by saying that the government works for us, we don't work for you guys. And it is o ur choice not to get this vaccine and when people have finally had enough you guys' won't have jobs. The school district is funded by the people that go to the school like students and if we all move online you guys' wont be making any money and you wont have any funds so, that's a choice if you really want to do that. If this is really for our health tha n why is Pfizer making a 2 billion dollar profit ? I'd like you to know the vaccine is not free. Taxpayers are paying for the vaccine, we continue to pay for it, that is why our taxes continue to go up. That's why these big drug corporations are making that money. They are making 2 billion dollars off of you guys and you think this is about health and you think this is really about people being safe. No its not, they are making money off of you. You guys keep saying \"trust the science, trust the science\" well you have to question science. That is what science is. You're not questioning science. I mean that's not science. So 4150 Technology Way, Suite 300 Carson City , Nevada 775- 684- 4200 Fax 775- 687- 7570 dpbh.nv. gov Page 18 of 40 many comments to cite your sources, look it up. Taxpayers are paying for vaccine, google it. Pfizer just made 2 billion dolla rs, google it. People can't sue if they are injured, and I want you guys to know if they are injured who is going to pay for it. Because I would sue the people who are supporting this. And you guys would pay the price for these students being hurt and whom ever else. That is all I have to say. Thank you. Dr. Pennell called a 10 minute break for the Board of Health, and he called on the meeting to reconvene at 10:40 am. Mr. Filippi announced to the public that those wishing to give comment to keep their hands raised and public comment will continue when the meeting reconvenes at 10:40 am. Mr. Filippi took rollcall of the Board of Health members to make sure quorum was still valid. The following Board of Health members were present for quorum after the 10 m inute break: Dr. Jon Pennell, Chair Dr. Trudy Larson Dr. Jeffery Murawski, Vice Chair Mr. Charles Smith Ms. Judith Bittner Dr. Monica Ponce With quorum verified the Public Comment period continued at 10:40 am. Destany Jones, I am a stay at home mom of one , and a student of S age Evy School . The option of being tested should, at the very least, be an option for students choosing not to get the vaccine. The common flu is just as bad as COVID -19 and we as students should not have to be required to have a flu shot to attend school. That's not requirement right now but being required to have the COVID -19 vaccine is ridiculous in my opinion. There are students that have been working so hard to get a degree to be a doctor, an accountant, an artist, and t o know all that doesn't matter anymore if they are not vaccinated is ridiculous. People should have the right to choose. People should have the right to tested regularly instead of having to be vaccinated. It should just be an option. Pro-choice is the opt ions for abortions and the option for so many things. America wouldn't be where it is today if people didn't have the option to choose. My ancestors would be in slavery right now if people didn't have the option to have a difference of opinion. Conforming people to just decide to be vaccinated and not have any second thought about it is ridiculous. People have the option to choose. I am not against the vaccine, I am against mandating something without letting people have the option to decide, so that is jus t where I am with that. Thank you. Letasha Minter, I am a transfer student from WNC (Western Nevada College) and transferring to UNR in the fall and I must say I am so excited to become part of the Pack. Whose vision is to educate and graduate the best prepared confident leaders for the state, national and global community. To be a nexus for research and creativity that focuses on the vital issues of our time. And I think that today's conversation is an excellent example of a vital issue of our time because what we are seeing here today is a moral argument. There is enough conflicting information as can be seen through the course of both sides of this conversation for there to be cause and concern for people to have questions. And I know as for me it' s exciting to see a group of students stand up and say, \"no not today\" \"no this is my choice\" \"no this is my right\" and they are within their bounds to 4150 Technology Way, Suite 300 Carson City , Nevada 775- 684- 4200 Fax 775- 687- 7570 dpbh.nv. gov Page 19 of 40 do so. We have heard comments today in regard to diversity and a community of wellbeing, but when you ar e forcing choices unto people that isn't a diverse community. That's not what that is. This is coercion, when you tell people that they have options and choices that's a really loose term because if you get vaccinated you can receive your education, but i f you're not vaccinated, sorry no go. That is not a choice. That is leverage so to sit back and say that one student is required to get vaccinated with something that is not FDA approved, whether or not it is in an emergency trial is a violation of individ ual rights and liberties. I'd like to have faith in my State Board of Health that they will see the moral failings behind this mandate, and they will do what's necessary to stop this mandate. And let the students of the NSHE make the proper choice for thei r body. Thank you for your time. Janine Hanson, State President of the Nevada Families for Freedom. We oppose mandatory COVID vaccines for Nevada college students. We do however, apricate the fact that you are recognizing exemptions for religious, philos ophical, and health reasons. This is very critical to maintain. College students are some of the least likely populations to get COVID -19. Israel was one of the first countries to impose vaccines and is now experiencing, according to science magazines, pro blems with young men ages 16 to 24 developing mild carditis, inflammation of the heart caused by the COVID vaccine. Independent researcher Virginia Stoner has issued a stunning new report on their numbers in an effort by the mainstream scientists to minimize the destructive effects of the COVID vaccines. Here are a few quotes from her report, \"more deaths have been reported to bearers from the COVID shots than from all other vaccines combined for the last 30 years.\" \"The number of COVID shots in the U.S. has injured, so far in 2021 is roughly the same as all other vaccines administered in 2021\" What a shocking 36 times more deaths were reported this year from COVID shots than there were reported last year from all other vaccines. And of course we know that some of the deaths are reported as errors. There is all kinds of evidence that these vaccines, which have emergency use, are not working. U.S. Senat or Angus King from Maine was fully vaccinated, but now has COVID -19 as does Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina. Governor Greg Abbott of Texas, also fully vaccinated, now has COVID - 19. To force anyone to participate in the medical experiment in viol ation of the Nuremburg Code. The COVID vaccines only have an Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA . Priscila Venzor, I am speaking as a law student attending an NSHE university. I am speaking on behalf of the Boyd Chapter of the National Lawyers Guild and concerned law students attending the William S. Boyd School of Law. We thank you for taking the time to hold this meeting and taking the time to listen to the voices of the community. Our student organization reached nearly 100 signatures on a letter urging the law school to mandate a COVID -19 vaccine. The law school administrators then sent the letter to NS HE, but NSHE has passed this responsibility unto you, the Board of Health. These are the voices of students which is a community that is most directly impacted by this body's decision. NSHE is not going to implement a vaccine mandate unless you, the Board of Health chooses to do so. We fully support the amendment to the NAC to require the vaccine. We can not wait on passing this policy. This mandate is urgent for university students that are unable to get the vaccine, or those who are high risk and for thei r families across the State of Nevada . Directing students and staff to preventable risks is a gamble that we ask the Board of Health not to take. Additionally, it is inaccurate to say that a mandate of the vaccination for in person attendance at a state un iversity is a violation of constitutional rights. Earlier this month the Southern Circuit Court affirmed the right for Indiana universities recent implementation of a COVID -19 policy. As stated by the Supreme Court under Jacobson v. Massachusetts there can't be a constitutional problem with a vaccination because there is no fundamental right to refuse necessary public health measures such as vaccines. We are asking the Nevada State Board of Health to mandate the 4150 Technology Way, Suite 300 Carson City , Nevada 775- 684- 4200 Fax 775- 687- 7570 dpbh.nv. gov Page 20 of 40 vaccine and keep Nevada classrooms safer for all. We trust and hope that you will make the correct decision so that we can resume in person learning in collaboration without inequity or fear. Thank you. Jodie Nelson, I have two students who attend higher learning in the Nevada educational system I w ould like to start out with some quotes and facts. The Moderna Chief Medical Officer Tal Zaks is on record as saying that the Moderna vaccine can prevent someone from getting sick with COVID -19, but there is no evidence that it can prevent someone from car rying and disseminating the virus. Additionally, the San Francisco Chronical has reported , and other news sources have echoed that the unvaccinated account for 95% of hospitalizations on record . However, the CDC Director Wilensky noted that on August 5 th that these statistics were obtained from looking at hospitalizations and mortality data from January through June 2021. A timeframe in which the majority of the population was unvaccinated. On August 1 st, 2021, the director of Israel's public health servi ces announced half of all COVID -19 infections were among the fully vaccinated. On August 5th , Dr. Jacob Haviv the Director of the Herzog Hospital in Jerusalem recorded that 95% of severe COVID -19 patients are fully vaccinated and they make up 85% - 90% of COVID related hospitalizations overall. In Scotland official data on hospitalizations show 87% of those who have died from COVID -19 in the 3rd wave that began in early July were vaccinated. In Gibraltar which has a 99% COVID vaccination compliance rate CO VID cases have risen by 2500% since June 1st. From the current data being compiled worldwide it reflects that the COVID -19 vaccine isn't as effective as we hoped at the rate of hospitalizations and deaths. I implore you to continue to give students the choice of vaccination and not to coerce students to choose between their .. (2:00 minute time cap) . Betsy Strasburg. I oppose this mandate. If anyone in the faculty or students are health impaired they have the right to take the jab. No one is stopping anyone from taking this emergency gene therapy if they want one. Since July , the fully vaccinated peopl e in Carson City ha ve gone up from 52% to 58% and that increase was achieved without a mandate. This vaccine cannot prove immunity. It is not in the same class as other proven vaccines used for immunization practices. How many years did we have the flu vac cine? It is not mandated, has it stopped the deaths with the flu every year. We are the lab rats for this new experimentation without full disclosure of risks, health risks by any health agency. Dr. Fauci says that the booster shots will be needed. This is within 8 months of the initial vaccination. This is a risk versus benefits analysis that every individual can do. They also can do their own analysis. This is your body, your choice. No one has the right to force decisions on students. Isn't the faculty t eaching our students to be free and rational thinkers ? How does this mandate fit that philosophy? Has anyone read the Nuremberg Codes which establishes research ethics for human experimentation at the end of the second World War ? They should. No human experimentation without consent , and so we do not need any vaccination mandates. When the academic institutional , this health law takes responsibility for adverse medical affects after this gap insurance companies will refuse treatme nt. Is the health Board willing to be the subject of multiple medical class action lawsuits? Jacob Bram, I believe that it is unreasonable and unethical to try and use our education against us as leverage to force us into taking the vaccine, that we have every rhyme and reason to be skeptical about. It is completely experimental, not FDA approved and has emergency approval , which is not the same as standard approval by the FDA. It has already been proven to not stop the spread of COVID. Furthermore, the Health Advisory and Recovery Team (HART) from the U .K. has informed us that several media outlets over there have released this story for alleged unvaccinated people are risking their own health and risk and will become potential factors in virus variants. Commenting on these news items is Dr. Jerry Quinn who has a post doctorate in microbiology and immunology points out the reverse is more likely to be true. He says there is unproven, but yet not discounted, theory that the possibility the vaccination may be making the mutant variations worse. Natural 4150 Technology Way, Suite 300 Carson City , Nevada 775- 684- 4200 Fax 775- 687- 7570 dpbh.nv. gov Page 21 of 40 immunity to COVID is estimated to be around 80% and it provides a broader protection. Not just narrow to a reaction not just the spike protein that the vaccine provides. Natural immunity is superior to the vaccine. Induced immunity because it includes the innate i mmune defense as specific immunity which is directed as multiple parts of the virus and not just the spike protein targeted by vaccine induced immunity. Dr. Tess Loury wrote Dr. June Lane , the head of the MHRA, or Medicine and Heath Care Regulatory Agency in the U .K. saying that the MHRA now has more than enough evidence from a yellow card system to declare the COVID vaccines unsafe for use in humans. I understand how you might see this as putting safety first, but how safe is it to rush and mandate a vacc ine when you don't know what the effects will be long term. Thanks. Kathlyn H awley. Thank you to the Board for holding this emergency meeting. I am going to college to get an education, not to contract a deadly illness. Vaccine mandates are not a new idea. I had to show proof of my MMR and my tetanus vaccine before going into 7 th grade. Supreme Court Justice Amy Comey Barret recently stood by the Jacobson v. Massachusetts decision regarding COVID vaccine in the Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit. Legality is not an issue the Board of Health is voting on today as this is legal. Many people are worried about any possible long term side effects of the COVID vaccine, and we don't know without a shadow of a doubt what if, those would be. However, we know exactly what happens when people contract the virus. People die. Hundreds of thousands of people are dead. If we have learned anything from the last year it is that we have the ability to conduct classes virtually, so your classes don't have to be put on hold. For anyone majoring in heath occupations that don't have a religious , or medical exemption , and still refuse to get vaccinated , you completely misunderstood what it means to be in health care . With that being said I urge you to require COVID vaccinations for all students. Thank you. Meloney Johnston. I just want to s tate that I have two daughters. One is at UNR right now , the other one is a senior and will be going to college. I want to state that I am against mandating, as they said it is not actually a vaccine. I am not anti -vaccination. All of my kids have gotten a ll vaccinations required up until the one. My main concern is that it has been in an experimental stage so far. We don't know the full term side effects of this vaccination going forward. It's not something I want my daughters to take. We don't know what i s going to happen in the long term. There have been numerus doctors, scientists, mental health experts coming out about the side effects. The warnings about this vaccination long term and short term effects. People dying from it. People getting serious side effects. Even from their reports they have shown more deaths from this vaccination than from all vaccinations in the past 30 years, as one other person commented earlier. Also, it is not shown that this vaccination even stopping someone who is vaccinated from getting COVID anyway. It is just something that I feel should not be mandated. It should be our choice if we want to get the vaccination and if someone wants to get the vaccination they should be able to get it, and they should be safe if they believe it or the mask. It should not be something mandated or forced. Judy Rushing. M andating a vaccine for a virus with a 99.98% survival rate doesn't make sense. It is actually criminal. This is not an FDA approved vaccine. What I want to know is, first of all if you are listening to all the people here. I am a UNLV grad myself. I have two students that are at UNLV. They have chosen to not attend right now because of potential mandate si tuation. For the people who want to get a vaccine, great, it is available for you go ahead and do it. For those that don't , don't mandate this. It is experimental. It is a Nuremburg Code violation and if you are listening and reading the comments there are so many students here whose voices need to be heard. There is so much \"science\" on both sides of the a isle, you have to see that there is not vast majority of people asking you to please mandate a vaccine. Instead allow the people's voices to be heard and their 4150 Technology Way, Suite 300 Carson City , Nevada 775- 684- 4200 Fax 775- 687- 7570 dpbh.nv. gov Page 22 of 40 freedom of medical choice to be utilized, so that if they want it they take it and if they don't want it they are still allowed to receive the education. They are being held hostage. Valerie White, I am 100% opposed to any mandate requiring forced vaccinations. If you approve this illegal mandate you will be disregarding the Nuremburg Code and any definition of ethical behavior or respect for human life. Why are so many of Nevada's bureaucrats, politicians, scientists, and doctors repeating the actions of Nazi Germany 90 years -ago? Why violate the Nuremburg Code? That code was established to prevent society from repeating the atrocities committed by Nazi scientists and doctors. Do you actually see what you are doing? You are on the brink of approving something that Nazi monsters would have loved. I f you approve this mandate you are complicit in the destruction of our nation. You know the vaccines are not safe. You heard a mountain of facts against them. You know that the vaccinations are not really about COVID. They are about control, destruction, a nd money. How will you sleep at night when you have turned your backs on the rights, freedoms, and health of Americans who are asking you to do the right thing? Please stand up and protect this nation and its citizens from the destruction of freedoms and r ights that are being taken every day. Refuse to do Sisolak's dirty work. The future will reveal who truly owns them and what is compelling these mandates. Refuse to collaborate with those who acting as traitors. Do not allow this mandate or force the vacci nations to go forward. Please do the right thing. Ramona Brockman, I would like to make some quick comments. I just sent in a letter, but I'd like to keep my comments a little shorter today. There have been a lot of people who have done the research on t his topic as you can hear. They are a very well informed public. I placed a request for information to receive documentation on what basis this Board is making their decision today, or suggested decision. I received no staff reports, I received nothing out side of the verbiage that is being proposed. So, I question how this Board is making their decision and on what risk benefit analysis they are making their decision on. I did not seem to get any response to staff reports, peer review articles or anything. Even the recommendation from other groups like NSHE, that supposedly have given recommendations. Where is the science ? The science, as you know, is unclear. It is not know n exactly what risks are involved with this vaccine. It is just unclear. So, therefore there are no scientific or legal grounds that you have to date to mandate a vaccine requirement for students to attend university or community colleges in Nevada. I ask e ach one of those Board members to remember their Hippocratic Oath. Again, as a practitioner you would yield risks and benefits to each chosen treatment and this is making a blanket statement for all students no matter who they are or their particular situa tion. Ashley Mendenhall, Student at UNR. I just want to start out by asking what is the push to get vaccinated, w hen there is a 99.98% survival rate of this virus ? There is a higher, more likely chance of you obtaining an adverse reaction or even death t han getting COVID itself. Some of these reactions are Bells Palsy, infertility, miscarriages, blood clots, strokes, and myocarditis. This alone should be alarming to you. Dr. Shaun Brooks says that Robert Malone, who is the creator of mRNA, wants it off the chart because we had known that this is unsafe. In the next 6 months to a year these people will die. Why is this you might ask? That is because by receiving your first shot your immune system decreases by 15%, and by the second it decreases by 35% making it hard to fight off infection in the future. This vaccine that is out will not protect you from the Delta variant or COVID- 19. According to the CDC in the last 30 days out of all of the COVID cases reported 72.5% of those have been vaccinated. Please gi ve us our freedom of choice on whether or not we get this as well as if you mandate it. Thank you. 4150 Technology Way, Suite 300 Carson City , Nevada 775- 684- 4200 Fax 775- 687- 7570 dpbh.nv. gov Page 23 of 40 John David, I am a UNLV student . I study Political Science and Nursing. I am in support of the vaccination mandate because it is our duty to be working together to be able to make sure we keep every single student on campus safe. I believe that these vaccines are effective. First off vaccines are not cures they are made to help reduce the risks of severe symptoms and hospitalization, and even death. For thos e who are saying this is gene therapy that is not true. On gene therapy it is the alteration of genes, and the vaccines don't do that. They take in the mRNA of that virus to be able to help and trigger an immune response in our bodies to make sure that our body is prepared to fight against this virus, and for those students that are opposing this mandate how are we going to be able to be on campus when they pass on vaccinations ? We use the vaccinations to make sure that everyone is safe. We want to make sur e that we don't have outbreaks and that is why I feel like this is a really good time for a vaccine for COVID. Because we need to keep our campus safe and be able to just allow students to be able to get the college experience that many of us are missing n ow. I just want to say that we need to do better than this because we can not be saying and comparing this with what happened in Nazi Germany. This is just a way different thing because before that was just persecuting Jews. This is a whole public health crisis where we need a cooperation. I feel like we do not need to be seeing anymore hospitalizations. That is already overwhelming our heath care system. Thank you. James Wright, a Public Health Student that works at UNLV in multiple capacities. COVID -19 has about a 98.2% survival rate, however on September 9 th, 2001, over 2,000 human lives were lost that day. We the people would have said with that many people have p assed away. However, 600,000 human lives alone in America have passed away from COVID -19 and counting. Furthermore, it has already been seen that if you contract COVID- 19 you will have long term effects such as difficulty breathing, constant fatigue, confusion, headaches, heart palpitations, diarrhea, insomnia, and more . While people who are vaccinated have lower complications to COVID- 19. Continued those who are unvaccinated against COVID -19 have higher rates of complications that in turn take up our hospi tal bed spaces. Our hospital bed spaces are not available for people who get into severe accidents, injuries, strokes, heart attacks, and more . As the virus evolves and becomes stronger we will lose, and the virus will win. Our future will cease to exist, and your degree will mean nothing. We the people need to come together to protect each other. I support the vaccine mandate with the very least constant testing for those that wish to receive it. Thank you for your time. Amy Clemens, I have a 19 year old daughter at UNR who is really wrestling with whether or not to get a vaccination and it should absolutely not be mandated. There is not enough long term study. It takes generally 7 to 10 years for a vaccine to come to market and we have no idea of the lon g term effects on my daughter. What if it causes sterilization ? There are many problems that could come up such as autoimmune. It has not been proven. It has not been approved and it should not be approved for our students. Thank you very much. Lily Choyce, I wonder if the State Board is prepared for lawsuits due to adverse reactions, death, discrimination, and limiting access to education. Why would you recommend a so called, preventative measure, that can cause the same outcome that COVID can cause? Why are tit ers used to confirm immunity and prove advocacy post va ccination, but not acceptable proof of natural immunity by contracting COVID ? It is deeply irresponsible and criminal to coerce the public to a science experiment that could have lifelong effects. There are several developed precedence that provide the autonomy for example the list goes out to Immunize Nevada and Pricilla Benzos specifically , since 1978 it was revealed that a person could not legally be compelled to participate in a medical treatment to save another person's life. It set the legal preced ent that the individual is not in the compulsion to aid another person at their medical and physical expense. Assuming that the vaccination actually works to save lives. Judge Flattery stated that a person to submit to an intrusion of his body 4150 Technology Way, Suite 300 Carson City , Nevada 775- 684- 4200 Fax 775- 687- 7570 dpbh.nv. gov Page 24 of 40 would defeat the sanctity of the individual and impose a rule which would know no limits. This could be the most perfect medicine and prevention and it would still be unethical to mandate it. What is right for you may not be right for everyone. I am opposed to mandati ng vaccines for students. Thank you. Byron Brooks, University Regent. I am speaking on behalf of myself today and not t he Board of Regents . Unfortunately, the topic of COVID vaccination has turned into a political and social divisive issue. As a Regent one of my responsibilities is to ensure that all system campuses have the tools and resources necessary for the betterment of their education . Currently a majority of students are not in favor of a vaccine mandate. Particularly a vaccine that has not been approved by the FDA. Additionally, health and medical decisions should be made between the individual and their doctor. Furthermore, if a vac cine mandate is enacted who is liable for any adverse reactions some may have by taking it ? You know it has been said to me that students and concerned parents deserve consideration as they are stakeholders in the development of education and education policies. Now nationally we are witnessing the failure of policy in a troop withdrawal that has produced complications and negative consequences. I am asking our leaders regarding state health an education policy to slow down and reevaluate this whole agenda. My concern is that mistakes will be made here that will cause negative generational consequences. I cannot in good consciences support this policy knowing that massive complications have occurred on some patients that have received this vaccine. T o Corona vaccine, or not, must be made between doctor and the patient. Thank you. Adrienne Michelson, I am a member of a community here in Las Vegas. I love living in Las Vegas and being here, but I also wound up getting Hodgkins Lymphoma, which is an emphatic cancer here, and beating it recently. I was able to complete chemo in April and I am happy to be a lot healthier than I was back then. The problem is individual liberties and freedoms are great and being able to talk to your doctor is great. That is what I did when I went and got vaccinated. After I finished chemo I went and talked to my cardiologist, to my oncologist, and my primary physician. In order to make the decision to go and get the vaccine to make sure I don't catch COVID nor that I spread it to other people . But it is not just about my personal decisions , because I live in a community with o ther people. Other people who may be immunocompromised or have cancer who may not be able to get the full vacs of a vaccine that does help the rate of infection and the rate of hospitalizations. And that is why I am in support of a vaccine mandate and why I support making sure that for something that has little to no effect on the human body. The lack of risk for the community is just substantial. Having had chemo, I had risks of infertile, I had Medi card as myself the risk comparative to vaccine is in comparable, so I recommend the mandate and I do recommend that people do get vaccinated. Nicole Thomas , President of the Graduate and Professional Student Association at UNLV . I represent over 5,000 graduate students at UNLV. I previously had prepared remarks, but frankly I am just disappointed and not surprised at the comments, and the previous statements being made. I surveyed my student body and over 60% of graduate and professional students want a vaccine mandate. We are educated students. We are students of science. We are students of public he alth. We have medical students respond. I am not here to be bullied in the chat. I am not being paid by anyone and am a Ph.D. student I received my master's in science. I am simply telling you what my students have voted for. Over 60% of them want a vaccine mandate. That's what I am giving you. I am hoping you will listen to the students on this call. I am hoping that you could listen to. I am looking through this right now and there is no combatting this unfortunately, I'm just trying to represent my stude nts. I appreciate you all and for the students that are on here trying to fight for a mandate I'd like to shout - out my roommate who has an immunocompromised daughter who can't get the vaccine, so her going to classes and courses is really going to hurt her daughter if she is unable. 4150 Technology Way, Suite 300 Carson City , Nevada 775- 684- 4200 Fax 775- 687- 7570 dpbh.nv. gov Page 25 of 40 Nathan Noble, incoming sophomore at UNR. I am a Senator for the Associated Students of the University of Nevada. Today I come to you merely as a student. A student who is concerned for his safety and the safety of his peers. I had planned a whole long speech filled with statistics and data about the virus, but I'm not going to do that. I am sure that each member of this Board is acutely aware of the multiplicity of sound medical evidence in support of vaccinations. The fact of the matter is this isn't a decision about facts. It is a decision about priorities. As I was looking through the comments this morning I noticed that every time a physician chose to speak they spoke in support of vaccinations. That is because of priorities . Because physicians take their oaths to the safety and protection of their communities. First do no harm, that is their priority. Over the course of this morning, I have seen a lot about rights, about freedoms, but the fact of the matter is in this countr y we prioritize safety above freedom. You cannot shout \"fire\" in a crowded movie theatre, that is not your right. Your right to throw a punch ends at my face and your right to carry a deadly virus ends at the point at which you choose to put others in danger by infecting other people around you. Recently a court decision was made saying that a school had the right to pursue a reasonable due process of vaccination in the legitimate interest of public health for its students, faculty, and staff . To the people threatening to sue , first of all, you will lose. But for the Board this is precedent, you can make this decision. So, I ask you where are your priorities ? Laura Vallet , I oppose this vaccine for educational learners. I am a mother of three here i n Nevada. I have been here my whole life. I am pleading with you and the Board members to do the job that you have been asked to do. Protect our children. This is an EUA vaccine. Technically it is experimental , being it is being distributed under an EUA ac tion. I'm not sure why the scientists you brought here today don't consider this an experiment. Have you spoken to other scientists, let me ask you, have you spoken to other scientists or researchers before you make this decision? Where is the data? Show t he data. Put the data out there. Listen to the people. Do your due diligence. Look it up. I want to talk about the EUA facts real quick. The biggest point I want to say is t he EUA guidelines cannot mandate a vaccine if there are reasonable treatments. Nobo dy has talked about treatments today. Board members, there are actual treatments for this vaccine. Look them up, over seven of them. Scientists, researchers, they are out there. You cannot en force a vaccine. Number two, you cannot enforce a vaccine without consent. You cannot coerce people to get a vaccine. Board members you are taking away education from our students if they do not comply. This is coercion. This is illegal, and this is wrong. I ask you not to make this rash decision. These vaccines are not like any others that have been tested on human beings before. We have one and a half years of studies on this vaccine and that is it. You are mandating our children to be test subjects. Please stand up today on the right side of history. Be on the correct side. Stand for our liberties, stand for student's basic human rights to decide what they can put in their body. And that it. Jayson Dagher, UNLV graduate student. I am in complete suppor t of the mandate. Unfortunately, some people on this call have not really done their legal research, so just so you all know vaccines are allowed to be mandated according to three Supreme Court cases. One in 1905, one in 1922, and one most recently this year when a Supreme Court Justice said it is allowed. I am here to protect our professors. Our professors are mandated to be vaccinated, and so are we. We are putting them at danger if we do not have a mandate for the students ourselves. A lot of them are among faculty in the political science and psychology department have opted to do online classes instead of in person due to their own safety. Wh ether they live with someone who is immunocompromised or has a heart condition, or a person like me who has liver disease. I'm so sorry that this is becoming a fight and you are all being attacked left and right. I can understand how you are all feeling right now. Just so you know a lot of s tudents are in support of the mandate. Unfortunately, you are not going to hear 4150 Technology Way, Suite 300 Carson City , Nevada 775- 684- 4200 Fax 775- 687- 7570 dpbh.nv. gov Page 26 of 40 from a lot of them because the folks on this call are in a silo of anti -vax information and websites. Please do your research and stand in support of the faculty and staff of our universities. Thank you. Haley Nicole, I want to speak to the females on the Board that are in this meeting. Obviously it is no surprise that you go to college to get an education. And there you continue to get married and have children. If you requir e us females to get this vaccine there is no saying that children are in our future anymore. It has came out that it can cause issues with reproduction. Honestly that is really not what I wanted to talk about all the way. I just want to say there's people in this chat that do have underlying health conditions, me being one of them. I have severe asthma, and I'm not even going to lie. I am terrified to get this vaccine because you get sick from it. And god forbid I get sick and end up in the hospital because you guys are making me get a vaccine, so if I get this vaccine because I want to continue my education then I get sick, then what ? Who's going to pay for those medical bills. Who's going to pay for everything else because if I get COVID there is no saying that I can survive that. I also want to talk about how I can get the vaccine and I can still get COVID. So, realistically why are you making me get a vaccine that is not FDA approved? T hey don't know what can happen down the long term. Honestly I personally don't think it is right at the time. I am not anti- vaccine at all. I think it just needs a little bit more time for them to figu re out everything and sort it out. They literally came out with this vaccine in 2 months , they are trying to push it on everyone in 6 months. Its just really not safe and I wish that it wasn't forced on us so quickly because I do feel like we just only nee d a little bit more time to see what is going to happen long term. T o all the people in the chat that are bashing people for their opinions, leave because you are bashing people, there is no need. People can have opinions. Thank you. Jamie Sullard, I prep ared a statement and I emailed it in to be read, but I wanted to comment on several other statements that have been made. The first comment is that it is a lie that getting vaccinated protects others. Every person that has spoken, who has made a statement on this call in support of that mandate is standing behind we need the mandate to protect the greater population. In service of serving our community instead of protecting our own bodies. I t is a blatant lie that getting vaccinated serves that purpose. It has been proven; it is all over the mainstream media it is widely accepted that if you are vaccinated you are transmitting COVID and you are getting sick with COVID . So based on that alone this conversation shouldn't even exist. It is a lie that the vaccin e has little effect on the body. That has been mentioned several times. I encourage you to do your own research instead of calling it a silo of anti- vax information. V isit the CDC website and investigate their VAERS system. There are over 1.96 million adverse events recorded as of July 30 th, it is not just 500,000. If you scroll to page 963 of those events it will show you 436% of that roughly 500,000 adverse events of 1.96 million. It is an awful lie that there is sound medical evidenc e in support of this mandate it is evil, wrong and it is corrupt in saying that as a native Nevadan and a mother to a daughter that I will not support sending to a higher education if that is mandated. Thank you for your time. I support everyone on this call for th eir opinions, but I do not support taking away our freedom of choice in this matter. Thank you. Zachary Powell, I would like to thank you for the ability to speak on behalf of thousands of students within every public educational institution in the State of Nevada. I am here to relay my reservations about the mandated vaccine effort coordinated for Nevada colleges. Not only is this against the foundings of freedom but its validity scientifically is lacking. While many may say it is for public health as noble , as this may be, and as good as those intentions are . The mask the public health hide state sanctioned tyranny, and even discrimination . Saying that if one is not vaccinated whe ther due to personal reasons, vaccine side effects, or simply the fact that they have had COVID antibodies, and you will never step on the campus again is inconceivable. Yet I remind you that these students and their families h ave paid thousands in tuition fees, books, etc. to fund the institutions 4150 Technology Way, Suite 300 Carson City , Nevada 775- 684- 4200 Fax 775- 687- 7570 dpbh.nv. gov 27 of 40 and pay the educators' salaries . At which they expect to receive quality education from. Therefore, a judgment of a mandated vaccination should be controlled by their families giving them the chance of choice. As frustrating as this is to hear American life does not void itself for a public health emergency. Now scientifically UNLV has approximately over 26,000 students aged from under 18 to 29. There are appr oximately over 5,000 students aged 30 and up. COVID survival rate in ages 29 and below are at 99%. Not only that we are seeing a rise in breakthrough cases. Logically speaking, why mandate something when even the vaccinated are getting COVID at a much lower percentage, but if we are to practically ban unvaccinated students from the campus why hypocritically the vaccinated are still getting COVID, why the mandate ? The trend is to approve a mandatory vaccine at which was cr eated in less than 12 months, unlike already acquired FDA approved vaccinations for measles, mumps, and etc . in American colleges and is doing them a disservice. One should expect to deserve education in peace. I urge this body to give Nevada students a choice rather than make one for them. Personal responsibility must prevail. Thank you for your time. Jenn Ramirez, I want to go on record stating that I am vaccinated. I r eceived the Moderna vaccine this year and I am opposed to mandating vaccines. I have two children who are currently in colleges in Las Vegas. I have my personal testament that I have had v ery adverse reactions since getting the vaccine. I have experienced elevated heart rate of 160 beats per minute within 12 hours of receiving the vaccine. Since having it I have had chronic headaches, extreme fatigue, tiredness, and currently experiencing memory loss. I do not want my kids to have to be mandated to take thi s vaccine. I am not, Justin I am not menopause sir . I am much younger than you think I had kids when I was much younger. Anyways I oppose the vaccine and I am a parent who absolutely pays for kids to go to college and if the vaccine is mandated they will be pulled from schools. That's all that I have. Melanie Sutton, I am opposed to this vaccine. I agree with many of my friends. I have given you all the facts. My son has done his education career hoping to get into UNR well with this vaccine. He is a 12 th grader this year. If you mandate this vaccine he will not be going to UNR neither will my other two children. As far as these people saying that it is legal for you to mandate this vaccine is actually incorrect because it is not FDA approved. They can only mandate it if it is FDA approved. It should have never been EUA approved because it has medications to help with the virus. So, I absolutely oppose this and I hope you are listening the majority that are calling in and speaking. Thank you. Launa Coleman, I would like to state for the record I highly oppose the mandate of the COVID -19 vaccine. Please, who will be responsible for health issues that come from si de effects , in 5 months, 9 months, or even a year after this vaccine is rolled out ? Have you guys considered the health crisis we will have then? The only difference is that it will be on your hands. Can you live with that ? After taking peoples rights away. Can you live with that? Can you look at yourselves in the mirror ? Can you pat yourselves on the back and say you did good for our community? If you mandate this you are playing Russian roulette with our lives. You are damaging the next genera tion. Who's supposed to take care of you when you're elderly? I'm not here to speak about facts or statistics. I think enough has been said about that through all the public comments. Which I support. I'm here to tell you that I have had my own experiences with people around me that decided to get the vaccine including a nurse at St. Mary's who worked on the front lines in the urgent care and took care of COVID- 19 patient s. She was happy to take the vaccine because she was told it was safe. She was told it was going to protect her. She was told that she would be fine. Well guess what. She has been hospitalized 3 times from heart issues related to the vaccine. I have another co -worker whose daughter had the vaccine and lost function of her arms. She went to the Renown Urgent Care and immediately was rushed to the main hospital. Once they found out it was because of the vaccine they told her she needed a brain scan. Because it was linked 4150 Technology Way, Suite 300 Carson City , Nevada 775- 684- 4200 Fax 775- 687- 7570 dpbh.nv. gov Page 28 of 40 to brain swelling because of the vaccine. She was told that she had no idea when she would get feelings back in her limbs because there is not enough data on this vaccine. Now they can't reverse what's been given to them. It is time to wake up and take a stand. This mandate is evil and in Jesus' name stop it. Jason Arceo, and I have been listening to the back and forth a nd I tell you if you really want to talk data. Back in March the CDC did say that 78% of the people that were on ventilators at the hospital, or that died from COVID were obese . So, if we were really interested in public he alth we should start there. D elete Panda Express from UNLV campus, which just some more data, a 3 plate entree that people usually get are about 2,800 calories and a ton of carbs. Which you don't need. If you are r eally interested in student health, you should start there. From Kansas City, later. Rocio Jara, I'm a current student at CSN and I am opposed to the mandatory COVID vaccine. This vaccine is not FDA approved and people who have received the vaccine can s till spread it, so why mandate a vaccine that can still be spread even when vaccinated. That makes completely no sense. Its my body and my choice. I am currently pregnant, and my baby's health is in your hands. This vaccine was not recommended by my doctor , so why are you trying to force something that is not recommended by my doctor. Especially to pregnant women. My baby's health comes first and if it means me not bettering myself and pursuing higher education, so be it. If the people who are vaccinated ar e so scared to go back to school with people who are unvaccinated, why aren't they the ones who should stay home and do online classes ? If they are so worried about their health. They cannot and will not silence us. Renee Rezentes. Thank you for allowing me to speak. I have been listening since 9:00 am this morning. I have experience using Ivermectin as opposed to using the vaccine. It works. I have done research on it. There are many doctors all over the United States that will prescribe. Some of them are licensed to prescribe from any state to Nevada. That's how I got mine. There are counties here that have doctors that will also prescribe it along with other medications that work. So, the vaccine supposedly is not the all in all cure. There're to o many scientific data that says otherwise. The vaccine is not FDA approved. It has not been animal tested. Ivermectin has, it is FDA approved and it is a parasitic medication, and it works. My husband passed away this month and they tested him, and they s aid that he was positive for COVID. I don't believe it because I had a heart attack 3 days later and they tested me, and I didn't have it. I have been with him since day one. I had already started the Ivermectin when he got sick just in case and I stopped it when I had the heart attack. I called the physician again, out of Ohio, and we started me on it again. For preventative and I am well, I am recuperating. Brittney Sheehan, and after hearing the students and the testimony that I have been listening to today I am going completely off script and I would like to speak directly to the students. The doctors that are sitting on that Board would not be there if the ir interest wasn't in using public health for expanding state powers. T hat is exactly what is happening here today. You can come with your facts and your data and cite your sources, but that is not what this is about. Its not about a moral argument, or any of the above. It's about force and let me tell you what Bastiat (Frederic Bastiat) said in 1850 about force \"we must remember that the law is force and that consequently the proper functions of law cannot lawfully extend beyond the proper functions of force.\" If you would agree violence is a justifiable means to this end, if you don't agree your only option is to unenroll if you oppose this use of force. If you do not subscribe to being subjugated and living in a society where they f orce drug you and hold you hostage. Your only option is to unenroll. I will not, and I already did not because I knew they were going to do this. They were talking about \"if it's FDA approved\" well that went out the window. I won't be going to school there . My children won't be going to school there. I f you are actually in opposition the 4150 Technology Way, Suite 300 Carson City , Nevada 775- 684- 4200 Fax 775- 687- 7570 dpbh.nv. gov Page 29 of 40 only thing that matters, the only opposition that counts is money. W hen you don't give them your money that is when you are boycotting. Ok, Rosa Parks did not beg and plead and be nice and cite her sources. She boycotted and that is what you need to do today. This ends here and this ends when you stand up for yourself because they will keep using their powers. Their emergency powers to create force on the populous. It doesn' t matter that we are all against it if you don't do anything about it. Ty Olsen, I just don't get how it seems like the deaths of young people and all the heart attacks that people are going into hospitals for is just being swept under the rug. All you s hould have to see is that and you would, should, get rid of this vaccine. People think that this mRNA is a gene therapy, and some think it is not. It actually is a gene therapy they used four different pegs to attach and adhere to the cell. Which then gets your gene therapy, the mRNA into the cell. It uses the ribosome to then create the spike protein in mass quantities until it is expressed out of the cell and into your body. At that point your immune system is supposed to attack it and sequester it. It is supposed to be sequestered in your arm where you get your shot. But, as we know now , the spike proteins, which causes the damage and the actual damage from the COVID virus too. Effectively they are giving you COVID when you get this vaccine. It makes no sense, and we know now that phase 2 receptors in the heart, brain, neurological system, and all your organs are attracting this spike protein. Causing severe damage. This is just unbelievable how this just is happening, and people think that this isn't li ke Nazi Germany in 1930 are in for a rude awakening here in the next couple of years. There is going to be hell to pay, mark my words. Madeline Clemens, I am currently a student at UNR. If need be, I will unenroll because I do not feel that it is ok for the government to tarnish my freedoms as a student. I am trying to get an education, do something for my future, and if this will stand in my way. I will find a new university to do what needs to be done , so I can make something out of myself. Thank you. Ginaly Martin, I am strongly opposed to mandating th is vaccine. I am a student currently at CSN and speaking from personal experience I contracted COVID a month ago from someone who was vaccinated. So, the science is unclear on this vaccine and the whole virus. I understand as a matter of public health if s omeone chooses to get vaccinated and if they believe that the vaccine works then they should be protected. S o why would you consider forcing others t o get vaccinated if they do not wish to do so? It is an infringement upon our rights, I believe, and if someone is not comfortable not being around those who are vaccinated then they should have the option to take the classes online. That is all I have to say. Thank you. Peter Grema, I am a senior at UNLV. I am dismayed at the public comment that has been going on and all the misinformation on the vaccine and the mandate. It is unbelievable that we have gotten to the point where people don't believe in sci ence. I'm for the vaccine mandate. I have been on the line for the last year and a half and it is a little ridiculous that we can't seem to get our act together and protect public health t o promote education and to allow us back fully in person. I trust the medical advice of the State Board of Health, that they will do the right decision. That they will ignore all of the misinformation that is being spread on these types of public forums. It is disgusting and quite frankly a lot worse for our society. Thank you. Laura Gryder, I am a n NSHE graduate student and educator trained in public health and social science research. I strongly support the vaccine mandate and am fully vaccinated. The science is clear that vaccines reduce incidents of death and hospitalizations compared to those who are unvaccinated. No vaccine works 100% of the time, but what it does is reduce these deaths and severe illnesses. I have two stepdaughters that are too young to 4150 Technology Way, Suite 300 Carson City , Nevada 775- 684- 4200 Fax 775- 687- 7570 dpbh.nv. gov Page 30 of 40 be vaccinated, unfortunately. Every person that is not vaccinated puts my family and the broader community at risk. It takes a village to create community and herd immunity and mandates such as this help keep our NSHE community safe for faculty, staff, and students. I urge the State Board of Health to follow the science. I thank you for your time. Geoff Snyder, I'd just like to oppose any type of mandatory vaccination anywhere. Whe ther it be a school or anywhere in the country is a crime. The data does not support this vaccination. If you want to call it a vaccination. Students should be able to have free choice of what goes into their body and make their own medical decision in any manner. I just want to say that I am s trongly opposed, and that is all I have to say. Jazman Barrera, as a student at UNLV we feel that the vaccine is profit over the safety of the people. We are not anti-vax; however, we do not trust this vaccine do to (in audible) fear mongering. We fully do not trust the statistics presented. We have not seen the long -term effects yet. Science (in audible) skepticism for progress. We have witnessed our experience and concerns missed by medical professionals . If you work for the people do dismiss our pains and concerns. Especially for minorities. I'd be ok (in audible) t esting but not force us to get a vaccine that has not been fully approved. I am immunocompromised and seeing the side effects on my fellow friends and the community (in audible) make up (in audible) were against this particular vaccine. The other reason (in audible) .... problems ( in audible) which makes me all the more skeptical of this vaccine. Thank you. Meghan (in audible) I am opposed to the vaccine (in audible) I'm an immunocompromised person and I will not take the vaccine; it is not safe at all. For the past 10 to 15 years everybody has been preaching \"my body my choice\" for women's (in audible) Mr. Filippi informed Meghan that there is an audio problem and that she can call into the meeting again or continue her comments. Erica (NLN) I am a student at Nevada State College (NSC) . I am not an anti -vaxxer. I had all of my vaccinations just like everybody else here in this group that w ent to school here in Nevada and transferred to the college system. So, we have all had our vaccines. However, everybody here wants facts , facts, facts. I talked to seven different doctors, seven . Some of us have medical issues where we cannot take this vaccine. It will kill us. It will kill us, so now these Board members , Health Department, want to make these decisions. We are at the chang e of making myself severely ill and death or get my education. That is not right, this is not right. The government had no right to overstep their boundaries into my life. So, you guys need to think about that when you are making these decisions to represe nt our whole state, and what you are doing. Because you are going to cause a lot of people to get sick and die. Just because they want to provide a better future for their children. You guys talk about \"oh we want a better future for our kids.\" How can we represent that and expect our children to do well when you guys don't give us the opportunity to do the same. I know you guys already made your decision. I have already called into the office they said you guys talked about this yesterday, it's not a secre t. I tried to get a medical exemption and there is not one at the schools for COVID -19 vaccines. There is for other vaccines. So, you guys need to figure out something to help people who medically can't and that want an education. Or guess what, come Monda y I'm out. Cyrus Hojjaty, Attendance is going to fall as a result of this, and I don't know how you guys are going to function appropriately. How are you going to get your funds ? Let's talk about the double standards behind all this. We just found out that our governor wants to bring refugees from Afghanistan, and I found out that they are not going to be taking the shot or tested. They did this as a double standard, then they use political correctness then to call us whatever they want. Speaking of all of this, when you look at it like the former Chief 4150 Technology Way, Suite 300 Carson City , Nevada 775- 684- 4200 Fax 775- 687- 7570 dpbh.nv. gov Page 31 of 40 Executive Officer (CEO) of Metro -Goldwin -Mayer (MGM) recently resigned in February and then he became part of the COVID taskforce, Jim Murren. So, when you see that they are heavily profiting from this pandemic, and they are pushing the vaccine you can basically see the whole picture of all this. I feel like, really, Nevada is becoming a corporate, fascist, state were casinos, state labor unions, and other interests are controlling the people. It is absolutely disgusting. You guys know, as an example, that half a million dollars of our own taxpayer money is being used and given to UNLV to help illegal aliens to fight deportation. Even though that money could be used to help people who are in this crisis or help small business. Absolutely disgusting. How do you expect me to believe this thought of a mandate is really necessary when you guys are not following the rules, you guys have dou ble standards and I'd like to know are these CEOs getting the shot ? Leticia (NLN), I am going to speak as a mom. I have a child at CSN. Who are you to tell me, or tell my child, that they have to get a vaccine? I'm not against vaccines, but there isn't enough long term effect data on this vaccine. She is not wanting to take this vaccine. So, you are no one to tell me or my child that she has to, otherwise her education is in jeopardy, ok. These kids are not having a regular high school year because of this pandemic. N ow they are trying to go back to normalized way of living and you're trying to mandate something that we are not fully aware of the effects of this vaccine. So, it is our choice. It is our choice what we put in our bodies. I had a very healthy child and I want to continue to have her that way. You are not going to gamble with my child's wellbeing, ok. Because I know if she gets COVID I know what can happen. But, if she gets the vaccine it is even a big ger gamble with her health and her life even. So, let us have our choice, ok. Let us have our choice, it is freedom. It's called freedom. We are so glad to be here in Nevada, but we're really looking into Florida because this is insane. It is my choice and my child's education should not be taken away because of her choice, her body. Molley Dahal, I voice my opinion that it is not ever anyone's choice but my own what I do or put into my body. I am going to read a quote from John Stewart M ill from his writings on liberty \"the only freedom which deserves the name freedom is that of pursuing our own good in our own way, so long as we do not tempt to deprive others of theirs or impede their efforts to obtain it. Each one of us is the proper guar dian of his own health what other bodily or mental or spiritual.\" There is absolutely no way in a free nation that anyone else, especially the government, can tell anyone what to do to their body. I adamantly oppose all vaccine mandates. Thank you. Eyvet te Dix, I am currently a parent who pays for my daughter to have a higher education at Truckee Meadows Community College (TMCC) and first off , I would like to congratulate you and your Washoe County School District (WCSD) that has completely taught our children not to have critical thinking skills to weigh the pros and cons of both sides. Not to just pick a side, but to seriously think it out. Currently there have been 2,519 deaths in adults between the ages of 18 and 29 across the United States since the beginning of COVID -19. That is a current statistic, and it is fact. So, you want to give a vaccine that is not FDA approved to over 60,000 students at UNR alone . That's not including TMCC, and which will, I know trickle down to our younger kids. You guys wh y don't we have some type of forum that weighs the pros and cons of doctors that is made accessible to the public where we get to hear both sides of doctors battling out the truths of what this COVID vaccine is. Right now , I just don't understand the way you are thinking. I can't believe you put our children in the crossfires of a political system placed it into our homes and into our families. That is unethical and completely immoral. I don't understand why you have people that you allow, students heckling in the comments section. Doing things like trolling. Does that show the maturity of your UNR students. It is just blowing my mind. This is not an FDA approved vaccine. It does not have enough science to back it and wait t ill the day, for 4150 Technology Way, Suite 300 Carson City , Nevada 775- 684- 4200 Fax 775- 687- 7570 dpbh.nv. gov Page 32 of 40 those who put into their bodies something that completely destroys them, and you have the backfire of what it does to you. In the minds it will be completely blown. Pray to god that you... (Caller 2555/No Name) Thank you very much, by the w ay it is nice to have this meeting only online. It was supposed to be in person, so everybody could see everybody is upset about it. Good way to hide everything guys. You have no authority to do any of this. The constitution forbids the government. The constitution is an instrument that we all agreed upon which recognizes the freedoms that god gave us, and the government is not supposed to get involved in that. Here you are putting what you believe is your authority, which you do not have the authority. In fact, the NRS specifically states if the public employee infringes on the citizen's right they lose their immunity. That means we are going to be able to sue you. Everything that you have done in your whole life to gain wealth will be gone if you make this decision. I'm just warning you. There is nothing that is going to protect you from this. Nuremburg happened and we already have those rules in place because of this and you refuse to look at that. You just do not have a right to tell anybody else what to do with their body or anything else. We all have individual rights, again, they are granted by god. Senator Mitch McConnell , a polio survivor himself , said it took 7 years to get 2 valid polio vaccines. You expect us to believe we put this in our body it i s sound science , after like 3 months of development. How did this get done so quickly? I don't think that it is valid . I see that there is a Clark County Coroner Freedom of Information Act Request (FOIA) from a friend of mine. He said that they only have 150 deaths where COVID is the primary and only 1 is in their 20's. if this is the most effective than why are people t elling us that we have to do everything for them ? If they already have the vaccine then they have a supposed immunity, right ? This is just totally absurd . The Tuskegee Experiment. We infected people in Guatemala 50 years ago. Hillary Clinton even apologize d for what we did there, and we are going to do it again. You know Ivermectin works, it works for my whole family. Mr. Filippi asked the caller for his name. The caller refused because he is afraid of what his government is going to do to him. Mr. Filippi handed the meeting back over to Chair Pennell and informed Chair Pennell that there were no more hands raised for public comment. Chair Pennell then asked if there was any additional public comment. Meghann Dyer, I am strongly opposed to this vaccine mandate. I am opposed to all vaccine mandates actually. The government should not tell any of us what goes into our bodies. We have been preached at for years, my body my choice, for a woman's right to abort a child at any point of her gestation. What happened to that ? Is it out the window now because that is not what we are dealing with anymore, we don't care about that ? It is still my body, my choice. I am an immunocompromised person, and I still will not get this vaccine. It has not been thoroughly tested. It has not even been a year since a vaccine has been out. (in audible) We are forcing this on everyone. It is not ok; it should not be forced on anybody. Conzello Barnhill III, I will just say real quick to the representation of Boyd Union. Article 1, Subsection 20 of the Nevada State Constitution specifically says that the enunciated rights in Article 1 shall not be misconstrued to deprive people of rights not listed. That's all. Melissa Vallet, I am opposed to this mandate. It is an experimental vaccine under an EUA and it should not be mandated for anybody and I would recommend any student that feels strongly about not getting it transfer to another university. I think that if you pass this you should go out of business. It is in violation of everyone's human rights to do this. When they were trying for the last decade to produce a Coronavirus vaccine all their animals in testing died when they were in (in audible) Dr. Fauci testified to this before all of this happened. This 4150 Technology Way, Suite 300 Carson City , Nevada 775- 684- 4200 Fax 775- 687- 7570 dpbh.nv. gov Page 33 of 40 has not been tested enough and the reason that the animals died the neutralizing antibodies, or whatever were causing that effect to the animals was found when they tested the vaccine on humans. But they are not telling everyone that. So, when you get the vaccine, and you are reintroduced to the wild virus you can have side effects in sto re and wind up with side effects and die. That is medical science. You cannot force this on anyone, and you should not force this on anyone. You should be testing for antibodies because anyone who has had Coronavirus has broad immunity. Non- specific, meaning any variant, they have immunity to. With the vaccine they do not. It is specific to whatever they were vaccinated with. That is all I have to say. Thank you. Bridget Solvie, my concern is that there are several people that do not want t o be vaccinated. Those people should be respected and honored for their right to choose. The discussion based upon the agenda is that you will be creating a situation that people have to prove immunity. It is my understanding that this vaccine does not give pure immunity. It gives a resistance, it gives the body some assistance, but it doesn't provide an actual immunity. The vaccine needs more time. Polio, MMR, D -tap, all the other vaccines that we have that students, and all of my kids have taken as they grew up and are now adults. No problem, they are all vaccinated. I am not an anti -vax person. I fully support vaccines that have researched, tested, and time improvement. This one is still questionable, and I think for the State cross that boundary of requiring proof of immunity. I just don't think that is a reality yet. I think that the state needs to take a pause. I appreciate the knowledge and the expertise that everyone sitting on the Board, but I think a pause is to be allowed. Because once you change an NAC and actually write that law as an amendment officially it is going to be extremely difficult for the public to claw that back and correct an amendment. If we cross that line and realize in 6 months or a year an d a half we made a gross error. Thank you for your time. Nathan (NLN), I am speaking in opposition to any kind of a mandate to force anyone to stick anything in their body that they do not choose to put in their body. A very wise man once told me \"you wi ll learn by the numbers\" and if you look at the numbers. The 99.9+% survivability rate does not cause justice to force people to vaccinate. And let's take a look at the fact that the PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test has actually lost it's EUA. So, do w e even know the real numbers ? The test is no longer considered valid because it does not differentiate between COVID, the flu, and the common cold. So, these inflated numbers that the media and the medical community has used to absolutely put everyone in a terrified frenzy. We don't even know how true those numbers are, and therefore we should not even be having this discussion at this time. Where you all are talking about forcing people to stick something in their body that has been proven to have over a m illion adverse events, not for the good. I strongly oppose this. You are doing an incredible disservice not only to the students of higher education in this state, but to everybody because this will trickle down to younger students. Pretty soon you will not be able to be a functioning member of society without your digital passport. This is a bunch of nonsense, and it needs to end now. I strongly oppose any mandate to force anyone to do this. Thank you. Randy Fenny, Please help protect our kids by making the right choice and keeping our medical freedom. This vaccine has already proven that you can still get and spread the virus. It has not done what you guys said it was going to do, from the beginning there are even thousands of adverse effects reported. O ur kids are there for their education. Not to have somebody dictate what they do to their body. Thank you. Chair Pennell thanked everyone and closed the public comment period. Chair Pennell reminded everyone that there will be a general comment period prior to the end of the meeting. The Board of Health took a recess until 12:55 pm. 4150 Technology Way, Suite 300 Carson City , 775- 684- 4200 Fax 775- dpbh.nv. gov Page 34 of 40 Dr. Pennell called on the m eeting to reconvene at 1 2:55 pm for the Board of Health members to discuss the agenda item. Mr. Filippi took rollcall of the Board of Health members to make sure quorum was still valid. The following Board of Health members were present for quorum after t he break: Dr. Jon Pennell, Chair Dr. Trudy Larson Dr. Jeffery Murawsk y, Vice Chair Mr. Charles Smith Ms. Judith Bittner Dr. Monica Ponce With quorum verified the Public Comment period continued at 12: 56 pm. Chair Pennell thanked everyone for their public comments. Chair Pennell allowed time for Board members to ask questions to Ms. Peek or members of the NSHE COVID task force. Chair Pennell started by asking Ms. Peek or any member of the NSHE COVID task for ce if weekly testing was considered as an option along with the mandatory vaccination? Ms. Peek suggested that Caleb Cage who serves as one of the co -chairs in that committee, or Mr. Reynolds, could answer Chair Pennell's question better than her. Caleb Cage repeated, so the question is \" was the weekly testing for state workers that is adopted now considered ?\". The answer is yes. The task force did consider this option. In fact, this recommendation that you are referring to from the task force came duri ng, while we were actively implementing throughout our system the governor's testing requirements throughout the state . The testing requirement was greatly appreciated , but, not seen as sufficient to protect students, staff and faculty within our campus communities. Chair Pennell thanked Mr. Cage and asked if there were any additional questions , or comments, from the Board of Health members . Dr. Murawsk y asked a questi on to Ms. Peek for the department, looking at the testimony that was provided there was a lot of questions raised around the experimental nature of the vaccine /virus , the non- experimental nature of the vaccine and around the considerations of what brought the vaccine to be added to the recommended list of vaccines. I'm not asking about general vaccine mandate merely the addition of this one. I am asking after hearing c omment if there are pieces of information that you would like to share with the Board? Ms. Peek stated that the recommendation came from, as you know, our Medical Advisory Team (MAT) . Dr. Trudy Larson sits on that advisory team , so I don't know if you ha ve feedback as well as Dr. Ihsan Azzam our Chief Medical Officer is prepared to speak to that as well ? 4150 Technology Way, Suite 300 Carson City , Nevada 775- 684- 4200 Fax 775- dpbh.nv. gov Page 35 of 40 Dr. Trudy Larson stated that she is a member of the MAT team for Governor Sisolak and our team met to look at this whole topic and the need of moving this forward as the right public health reaction. This is a public health emergency still , and the data thus far prove out the effectiveness of the vaccine in reducing s ignificant serious illness and hospitalizations as a result of even the new variant and it is very safe. Of over 357 million doses that have been given of this vaccine there are very few significant side effects that have been reported, and the ones that have been reported have been investigated by the CDC. So, very low numbers, a s the Task Force looked at the preponderance of evidence understanding that the survival rate is high, but the risk of the vaccine is much, much lower. We came to the conclusion that these vaccines were very effective in blunting the impact of this COVID pandemic that we are in the middle of , and we did that based on the effectiveness of the data. Which the FDA is currently looking at for a full approval. The EUA means that they approve the vaccine for the uses in the emergency , and the emergency is the CO VID pandemic. S o the data that has been presented to the FDA is quite complete in terms of the effectiveness and safety. They continue to monitor it; in fact, this is probably the most monitored vaccine we have ever had because there is such huge public interest in it, and it is in the public's benefit to see the investigations are ongoing. So, we are very confident that this would meet all standards for making it safe and effective use, broadly speaking in many categories of workers and students in our state. Thank you. Dr. Murawsky asked Dr. Azzam if he had anything to add. Dr. Ihsan Azzam , Nevada Chief Medical Officer stated that Dr. Larson covered that ve ry well , but as the word \"experimental\" certainly doesn't apply when the vaccine was given to 370 million doses in the U.S. and over a billion doses globally. There was no vaccine, ever, that was given to this amount of people and monitored. It is extremel y safe. It is extremely effective. However, again, there is nothing which is 100% effective. We know from the clinical trials that 93 effectiveness means that out of every 100 people who get it , 7 may not be fully protected and that is why we see individua ls getting infected. W e do know for sure that those in the hospital and those who died, most of them, over 97% of them were not vaccinated. This vaccine is very safe. It is very effective. Th e ability of the effectiveness was evaluated. Tons of studies were done. We know really that, like every other vaccine, that immunity fades over time. The CDC in, process was the ACI P, are evaluating when the best time is to get a 3 rd dose. The studies show that the 3rd dose will boost our antibodies by 10 fold. So, certainly it is one of the most effective vaccines in the history of vaccines and one of the safest. Chair Pennell asked the Board if they had any further questions. There were no further questions. Chair Pennell asked the Board for a motion. CHAIR PENNELL REQUESTED A MOTION TO APPROVE THE CONSIDERATION AND POSSIBLE ADOPTION OF PROPOSED EMERGENCY STATEMENT AND EMERGENCY REGULATION AMENDMENT OF NEVADA ADMINISTRATIVE CODE (NRS) 441A.755. RELATING TO UNIVERSITY, COMMUNITY COLLEGE, AND STATE COLLEG E STUDENTS PROVIDING PROOF OF IMMUNITY TO CERTAIN COMMUNICABLE DISEASES, INCLUDING COVID- 19. A MOTION WAS MADE BY DR. MURAWSK Y TO APPROVE THE ADOPTION OF THE EMERGENCY STATEMENT AND EMERGENCY REGULATION AMENDMENT OF NEVADA ADMINISTRATIVE CODE (NRS) 441A.75 5. RELATING TO UNIVERSITY, COMMUNITY COLLEGE, AND STATE COLLEGE STUDENTS PROVIDING PROOF OF IMMUNITY TO CERTAIN COMMUNICABLE DISEASES, INCLUDING COVID- 19 AS SUBMITTED . THE MOTION 4150 Technology Way, Suite 300 Carson City , Nevada 775- 684- 4200 Fax 775- dpbh.nv. gov Page 36 of 40 WAS SECONDED BY MR. CHARLES SMITH. THE REGULATION WAS APPROVED UNANIMOUSLY WITHOUT ABSTENTIONS. 3. GENERAL PUBLIC COMMENT Chair Pennell opened the meeting to public comments and started informed everyone that no action will be taken on this agenda item until scheduled on an agenda for a later meeting and that the same considerations will apply for testimony. Comments are limited to 2 minutes and the Board would like respectful behavior. Conzello Barnhill III, Thank you guys for holding this meeting today. I just want to say this totalitarian nature absolutely disgusts me. I am absolutely disgusted by this decision made. You guys sat there and danced around the idea of wh ether its experimental or not. No, no, no, that is not the real problem. The real problem is that we are doing an mRNA vaccine that is only protecting from the spike protein. The antibodies for the spike protein is totally different from the antibodies from the entire virus. We are not being int roduced to an entire virus. From every vaccine that has been approved: Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, and P fizer they don't do that. So, people are still going to get infected no matter if they get vaccinated or not. The antibodies are just blocking the spike proteins from attaching to the cell. It is completely ridiculous that you guys did this. Now from my understanding this is also going to go through another for um that was mentioned before. I am absolutely disgusted. You got the anti -freedom CCP biologists . It is ridiculous. You guys are dancing around these semantics and not actually looking at the actual things. It's not about wh ether it is experimental. It's not wh ether it actually provides protection. It only dampens the symptoms that people face, so now what is going to happen is we are going to have a high population that is actually getting the disease and as the disease is getting introduced to these people that are vaccinated and have antibodies against the spike protein. The spike protein is going to mutate, and selective evolution is going to occur. Now we are going to have a disease that is more effective in in fecting people. This is ridiculous, absolutely ridiculous. I am disgusted that you guys can sit there with your doctor titles and sit there and not speak about the entire facts. You want to sit there and talk about the experimental. You disgust me. Thank you, have a good day. Jamie Seller, Thank you Joseph. I am just in shock a nd awe that you as a Board would unanimously agree with this mandate in spite of over 100 comments that you heard today. That have all addressed the legal issues, the moral issues, and the safety issues and concerns. My daughter will not be attending a NSH E institution and if this is trickled down as many of us suspect it will be. I will withdraw her from school. There is nothing that you can do to force me to vaccinate my child, but instead be crippling your institutions and hopefully more people will follow suite. I am very disappointed in this Board and the direction that it is going a nd your inability to use critical thinking and logic in your decision making. Joshua Z urble, I am a student at UNLV. I am not going to speak to the anti -vax sentiment duri ng public comment because in fact over everything the last year and a half fighting anti -vax and trying to clear up misconceptions is that you can't convince a mind that doesn't admit that you can persuade them. Basically, it is a waste of time. I'm here for two reasons. Support the vaccination mandate and to point out the cowardice of the majority of currently sitting NSHE Regents. When asked their stance in the press they were silent. Even though they are public officials beholden to the voters. One Rege nt in particular, Byron Brooks instead took to Facebook where he spread anti -vax messaging. Which, frankly, is par for the course considering his Proud Boy affiliation , a known white supremacist group. Which is the video that I am playing currently. Finally, I want to say I am proud to be a UNLV student right now. A lot of support for the mandate came from UNLV and student leaders . Good job reflecting your public courage and don't stop. Thank you. 4150 Technology Way, Suite 300 Carson City , Nevada 775- 684- 4200 Fax dpbh.nv. gov Page 37 of 40 Hailey Nicole, I just want to say that this isn't for anyone on the Board. It for all you people in the messaging in the comment chat section. Whe ther it was mandated or not we are all still humans and humans deserve to stand up and speak what they have to say. For all you people that were, and st ill are in the comment section bashing people for how they feel about this ; you are the p roblem and without people like that realizing that you are the problem. You need to go, stop. Literally stop please. Stop bashing these people for the choice that they made. Stop bashing parents for the choice of vaccinating or not vaccinating. Stop bashing parents for coming on here and standing up for their children. Stop. Because at the end of the day we are a country that has freedom of speech. We have the right as a human being to come on here and say what we have to say and speak our mind. All you people in the comment sections that are bashing people for their opinions, stop please. You are the problem. And until you realize you are the problem this problem will be around forever. So just stop. Literally stop. If you don't want to get vaccinated don't get vaccinated. Stay at home. Go to online school. Go to a different school do whatever you need to do but don't bash the people who feel that vaccines are going to help them and going to help them have a long life and protect themselves. Don't bash them. Literally just be a decent human being. If you don't agree with it that is fine. Don't agree with it, but don't be rude. That is all I have to say. Board thank you fo r your time. Parents that are standing up for their children, thank you. Students that are on here standing up for yourself, thank you. Thank you for being a good human, and for those who are being rude, please leave because you are the problem. Shelby M cCard. I have more of a question. If there is anymore UNR people left on here , but with this mandate now in place, what exactly does it entail ? Is it going to go in effect for fall, or when is the date by which we will need to be vaccinated ? Is it going to be enforced for the coming fall term within just a matter of days or is it going to be put in place for spring 2022, like when it said this me eting was not an emergency meeting and was placed for September ? Mr. Filippi stated that he could defer to Ms. Peek or the Chair, but it was to require proof of immunization by November 1 st, 2021, in order to register for the spring semester coming up in 2022. So, I hope that answers your question, just so you know public comment is not meant to be a Q&A it is meant to give your public opinion of a topic. Chair Pennell thanked Mr. Filippi and concurred with what he said. Sandra Quark. Honestly I'm not surprised by the Board's decision considering that the Nevada Board of Health is just a government entity and the institutions in question of NSHE are they themselves funded by government money. Whe ther it be through financial aid or subsidized student loans. So, it would be a miracle if they actually listened to public opinion, and of students on this meeting. But it is not how the Board wants to think. They are beholden to the money that comes from the government. They are not beholden to us. The only thing that we can do as students is to un- enroll. That is literally the only thing we can do a nd that is sad. Shame on all of you students, professionals that have commented discouraging those who want to make the decision to vaccine or not. Based on evidence that you have purposely created. It's honestly just shocking that you can't respect these choices that we as a student body want to make. That is all I have to say. Doug Unger, President of the U NLV Chapter of the Nevada Faculty Alliance, and Government Affairs Representative for Faculty from CSN and Nevada State Collage and UNLV. I would like to thank the Board for its rational and sane decision to approve this emergency measure . Which will incre ase workplace safety for 4150 Technology Way, Suite 300 Carson City , Nevada 775- 684- 4200 Fax 775- 687- 7570 dpbh.nv. gov Page 38 of 40 faculty and will save lives. Not only faculty, but also students. I know 11 faculty members who have died of COVID- 19 before the vaccination was available. Also, my dear friend Sam Liberman, or Nevada Regent who was among the first to die of COVID -19. We believe this will vastly increase our workplace safety and our comfort in engaging in in -person classes once again. I also sympathize with all of you who have expressed vaccine hesitancy and who are really reluctant to take the vaccine. Please know that we will work with our administration centers at UNLV and our other colleges to make sure that those of you who do not want to take the vaccine can be accommodated in ways that promote online classes and you can progress with your educ ation in that forum until such time as you are comfortable getting vaccinated, or the community health emergency has waned enough so that in- person class attendance without being vaccinated is safe once more. Thank you all for your participation and please know that as a representative of UNLV faculty I've listened very carefully to what all of you have had to say. I appreciate your comments and once again I would like to thank the Board for it's sane and science based decision. Thank you. Brittney Sheehan, I already knew this decision was going to happen. So, this state has expanded its police powers into the bodies of students. I hope you are all very proud of yourselves. I would like to thank Byron Brooks for making a comment today, Regent Byron Brooks, and I would ask that he would take on this issue in his official capacity and not just his personal capacity. I would like to encourage all of the students and faculty to understand the concept of consent and that no means no. It doesn't mean I'm hesitant. It doesn't mean any of those things. I think you are promoting a medical rape culture. When you won't take no to mean no. I don't appreciate the last commenter. I think everyone should unroll because we don't have to participate in your little experiment on society and you can all have a good day. Laura Vallet, You heard me speak earlier. I am just devastated with the decision that was made today. I'm just trying to understand how it is truly legal for you guys, a nd for the government, to surpass certain guidelines that have been put out there by the NIH and they're not being upheld. You guys are circumventing them. I think this is a legal issue and really think that us parents and us people in our state, no I'm not crying, I think that we all need to stand up. I just feel like you guys are on the wrong side of history today for what you did to our State of Nevada school system for higher education a nd it will be, mark everyone's words, (in audible) your decision was the wrong one today and that it is the wrong one for our students and the wrong one for our state. Us people need to band together and make these people liable for their actions. Our government, our governor, you guys, our Board members, all of you are a part of this. We all need to stand up somehow. Let's figure it out guys because we have a voice. The go vernment should not be ruling our choices, our kids' choices, our personal human right choices. Goodbye. Sean Chappie, Student at UNLV. I wanted to say thank you to the second doctor that made his comment about the data provided. I believe his comment wa s very sincere, however, I think that we have to admit that there are a select few that if they receive this vaccine that they will be harmed. Personally, I have a medical condition that has reduced my blood flow in the veinous circulatory system. So, basi cally I'm at risk for blood clotting so I will not be getting this vaccine. But I myself would like to attend classes in person in the future and your decision will not allow for that. I believe this decision supports the majority, but I think you should a lso consider the minority. Thank you. Geoff Snyder, I'm just shocked, flabbergasted, disgusted that you guys would make this decision. Going along with taking away a person's right to choose for any type of treatment of their body. So, when did a free Ame rican's immune system become null and void, cancelled, disregarded, or not valid. When did the human 4150 Technology Way, Suite 300 Carson City , Nevada 775- 684- 4200 Fax dpbh.nv. gov Page 39 of 40 body's antibodies become disregarded after a 1,000 years of a proven track record. People who have taken the shot are already recontacting the COVID -19 vir us. Strange because the previously targeted cells in their body have been altered and destroyed preventing further immune response use. This is a crime against humanity. These people are now screwed into taking boos ter shot, after booster shot, after booster shot to stay healthy. So, now you have these so- called vaccinated people who catch and spread every new virus strain that comes down the pipe. These people are spreading virus after virus on a scale hundreds of t imes greater than anyone who has created natural immunity from their own god given body cells and immune system. For an institution that trains doctors you sure haven't listened to any doctors. Doctors all over the world are speaking out against this genet ic altering and forced treatment. The national news, politicians, and government bureaucrats have all of a sudden become armchair physicians. Armchair physicians are being propped up while real doctors are being silenced . What kind of higher education boar d of directors would go along with silencing doctors trying to sound the alarm on genetically altering and life altering experiments . That has not been properly tested, vetted, or crosschecked. This Health Department and Education Department is on the wrong side of history. Connor Harbak, I have been a student at multiple Nevada campus' at UNR first then CSN. There is just so many things here that I want to say. That I will just go down in a kind of scatter shot fashion. I have worked on college campus. I have traveled the state, I have tr aveled the country. Throughout this doing activism. This comes down to my body my choice. For me this is not an issue with the vaccine. It is not an issue with the medical establishment. It is not any issue with this. It is simply the fact that I own my bo dy. Nobody else can mandate what I do with my body. T hat is the one thing that we will always have. Our right to is our self - ownership and our bodily autonomy. This is removing our bodily autonomy, obviously, by forcing us to get a medical treatment. Which again, I am perfectly fine with the treatment itself and I have recommend ed it for family members. My parents have it as do my grandparents. What is most important here is that students have not got to decide what will happen to them in schools. This is a top down and inorganic movement. There has been no public vote. There has been no public allowance of this to occur to people. Big pharma profits off this, so you and whomever voted for this mandate are directly supporting the pockets of big pharma. As booster shots have been mentioned here we will required to continue pumping money into them. So far it has been along the lines of 20 billion into Pfizer in the last year. They made more vaccines in the last year than they had previously. This will only decr ease access to the people most maligned in our society. We know that this makes and effects minorities more because of their lack of access to the vaccine. So, what we are essentially doing is, and people talk about medical apart heid, we are in fact reducing the people most effected access to education, and that cannot simply be accepted. Public schools are for all people. Not the medically treated, not the anointed by the ones on top. It is for the public and we are the public. Amber Burnett. There is so much to go over in these two minutes. I am highly disappointed in the Board's mandate on this vaccine. My husband is a Marine veteran and he enjoyed going to UNLV for a few semesters and he will not be back. Even if he wanted to get this vaccine, which he does not, I don't think that anyone should be supporting this because we should have the choice of what goes into our body. I have a friend who is 33 years old, she is a flight attendant, and that is my profession as well. S he has lost the ability to walk after the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. She suffered from a neurological damage after she received it. She is learning to walk again. you can follow her on Instagram her name is @ unbreakable_kaite. It is not right that you guys are forcing this on people. If you go look at reporting for vaccine injury there have been over half a million COVID vaccine adverse events reports. Over half a million. H istorically only 1% wh o adverse reactions to vaccines get reported to VEARS . Many people do not know how to file a report, and many people are overwhelmed with 4150 Technology Way, Suite 300 Carson City , Nevada 775- 684- 4200 Fax 775- 687- 7570 dpbh.nv. gov Page 40 of 40 their medical situations, so they don't file a report. Please consider overturning this. It is wrong. That is all I have to say. Thank you. Caleb Cage who serves as NSHE Task Force Co -Chair, Vice Chancellor for Workforce Development and Chief Innovation Officer . I just want to thank the members of the Board of Health and Chair Pennell for your leadership and discussion during this meeting. This is obviously a challenging topic and one that requires input from the public. I really appreciate how you handled this in a welcoming and open way. I appreciate your leadership in making the decision and I would also like to thank one of my public hea lth heroes in the state , Julia Peek and her team for all of their hard work in putting together this opportunity. Thank you for your deliberation and thank you for the MAT for their hard work as well. So, please accept my gratitude and offer to you as a me mber of the public. Thank you very much. Topher Reynolds. I just want to thank the Board for making the right decision today and I know a lot of people have a lot of misinformation floating around and I know you guys had a tough job today. But you made the right choice today. A s a full time faculty member and a student I spend a lot of time in NSHE buildings and I appreciate you looking out for the safety of my colleagues, myself, and my fellow students. Have a good day. Mr. Filippi reported to Chair Pennell that there were no more members of the public wishing to give comments. Chair Pennell thanked the Board, the Division of Public and Behavioral Health and everyone who called in from the public. Chair Pennell stated that he knows this is an emotional topic and that he appreciates your time. Chair Pennell then adjourned the meeting. Meeting Adjourned at 1:39 p.m. "}
