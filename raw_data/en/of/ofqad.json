This will help them manage your care and keep you safe. How It Works Ayurveda is a medical system that originated in India. Oral formulations, dietary and lifestyle changes, and yoga or meditation are the main components. Herbs such as curcumin have beneficial effects but should be used under supervision. Yoga and meditation help alleviate side effects associated with cancer and its treatments. Derived from the Sanskrit words \"ayur\" (life) and \"veda\" (knowledge), Ayurveda dates back more than 3,000 years. Treatment is tailored to the individual and consists of oral formulations containing herbal, mineral, spice, and animal components; cleansing practices; dietary and lifestyle changes; and improving mental balance through yoga or meditation. Commonly used herbs in Ayurveda, such or anti-inflammatory properties. Studies in humans however, are quite limited. Some data suggest various Ayurvedic formulations may be helpful for diabetes, knee osteoarthritis, or rheumatoid arthritis. However, additional studies are needed. One study of [guggulipid](/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/guggul) to treat high cholesterol found it may actually raise cholesterol levels. [Curcumin](/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/turmeric) is among the most extensively studied, but positive findings on cancer preventive effects are preliminary. Lifestyle changes and mind-body modalities are also a core component of Ayurveda. [Yoga](/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/therapies/yoga) and [meditation](/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/therapies/meditation) have been shown to help reduce symptoms associated with cancer and its treatments. Purported Uses and Benefits - To treat cancer-related symptoms [Yoga](/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/therapies/yoga)has been shown to improve sleep, mood, and quality of life, and reduce stress in cancer patients both during treatment and throughout survivorship. [Meditation](/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/therapies/meditation)has been shown to reduce anxiety, lower blood pressure, and enhance well-being both in the general population and in oncology settings. - To treat diabetes Several herbs used in Ayurveda have blood glucose-lowering effects, but the clinical evidence for their use is not strong. More studies are needed. - To lower high cholesterol A study of the herbal medicine [guggulipid](/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/guggul)found it may actually increase cholesterol levels. - To treat arthritis A few preliminary studies suggest benefit with various Ayurvedic formulations, but additional confirming studies are needed. Patient Warnings - Although heavy metals such as lead, gold, and silver are traditionally used in Ayurvedic formulations, the use of lead for its assumed benefit has been a cause of concern. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 12 cases of lead poisoning associated with the use of Ayurvedic medications. - Improper use of nasal rinsing devices such as Neti Pots have been associated with rare but severe infections. Only distilled or sterile water should be used and these devices must be cleaned properly after each use. Do Not Take If - You are taking phenytoin: The Ayurvedic syrup shankhapushpi causes decreased blood concentrations of phenytoin. - You are taking CYP450 substrate drugs: Several ayurvedic herbs induce or inhibit CYP enzymes, and may reduce effectiveness or increase the risk of side effects of these drugs. - You are pregnant or nursing: Adhatoda vasica, an herb often used for respiratory tract ailments, may induce labor or abortion, and other ayurvedic formulations have caused birth defects. Side Effects - Skin hypersensitivity and rash with [guggulipid](/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/guggul). - Itching, GI discomfort, nausea, oral ulcers and elevated liver enzymes with Ayurvedic formulations in one study. Case reports - Heavy metals, liver toxicity, and arsenic poisoning with various Ayurvedic preparations. Special Point - Although Ayurveda is available in a few clinics in North America, there is no licensure for practicing Ayurveda in the United States. For Healthcare Professionals Clinical Summary Derived from the Sanskrit words \"ayur\" (life) and \"veda\" (knowledge), Ayurveda originated in India over 3,000 years ago. Treatment is patient-tailored and consists of oral formulations containing herbal, mineral, spice, and animal components, purgatives, dietary and lifestyle changes, and improving mental balance through yoga or meditation. It is available in a few clinics in North America, but there is no licensure for practicing [Ayurveda in the United States](https://www.ayurvedanama.org/). Ayurvedic medicinals, which can contain from a few to hundreds of components, are commonly used to treat chronic diseases such as diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, Parkinson's disease, acne, obesity, and cancer. Studies in humans are quite limited, perhaps in part due to the individualized nature of Ayurveda treatment. Preliminary data suggest some benefit of various Ayurvedic formulations for diabetes [(46)](#references-46). In an equivalence study, pain reductions and improved function with either of two traditional ayurvedic formulations were comparable to glucosamine and celecoxib for knee osteoarthritis [(47)](#references-47). However, additional safety studies are needed. Other preliminary data suggest that an individualized Ayurvedic treatment may be as effective as methotrexate against rheumatoid arthritis [(48)](#references-48). A clinical trial of [guggulipid](/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/guggul) for hyperlipidemia found it may actually raise cholesterol levels [(3)](#references-3). A few Ayurvedic herbs are being investigated for their anticancer potential. [Curcumin](/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/turmeric) is among the most extensively studied, but positive findings are preliminary. Lifestyle changes and mind-body modalities are also a core component of Ayurveda. [Yoga](/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/therapies/yoga) has been shown to improve sleep, mood, and quality of life, and reduce stress in cancer patients both during treatment and throughout survivorship. The effects of [meditation](/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/therapies/meditation) in reducing anxiety, lowering blood pressure, and enhancing well-being both in the general population and in oncology settings have also been confirmed. Purported Uses and Benefits - Arthritis - Cancer-related symptoms - Diabetes - High cholesterol Mechanism of Action Ayurveda emphasizes both health maintenance (Svasthavritha), and diagnosis and treatment (Athuravritha). Patients are classified by their prominent dosha, or physical, emotional, and metabolic type, Kapha, Pitta, or Vata, each located in specific organs and associated with two of the five elements (earth, fire, water, air, and ether) and five senses. The doshas represent properties shared by the organs, body, environment, and cosmos. When a patient's unique state of dosha is out of balance, illness occurs. Therapy is personalized to the individual's problems and metabolic characteristics to restore balance through diet and lifestyle modifications, medicinals (herbs, spices, metals and/or animal products), breathing exercises, and meditation. Detoxification (panchakarma) occurs before administration of medicines, which includes bloodletting, induced vomiting, and bowel purging. The therapeutic approach seeks to cure disease by reversing the steps that led to it (eg, administering cooling medicines if Pitta, the hot dosha, is predominant) [(10)](#references-10). Maharasnadi Quathar, a medicinal used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, increases antioxidant enzyme activity, decreases TBARS generation, and improves symptoms in human subjects [(16)](#references-16). Many of the frequently used herbs, been studied extensively in and vivo, and show antioxidant, antitumor, antimicrobial, immunomodulatory, or anti-inflammatory in vitro and in vivo. Mucuna pruriens, used in preparations for Parkinson's disease, longum, and Terminalia chebula that are said to promote positive health showed immunostimulant and adaptogenic activities in an animal study [(18)](#references-18). preparations (eg, Swarna Bhasma) have effects in [(19)](#references-19). herbal mixtures Maharishi Amrit Kalash-4 and -5 properties, inhibit LDL oxidation in vitro, inhibit platelet aggregation, and cause a reduction in aortic arch atheroma in hyperlipidemic rabbits [(20)](#references-20). An in vitro study investigated the activity of extracts from eight plants that are traditionally used as immunomodulators in Ayurvedic significantly reduced viral production in human lymphoid CEM-GFP cells infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-INL4). Warnings - Although heavy metals such as lead, gold, and silver are traditionally used in Ayurvedic formulations, the use of lead for its assumed benefit has been a cause of concern. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 12 cases of lead poisoning associated with the use of Ayurvedic medications [(22)](#references-22). - Improper use of nasal rinsing devices such as Neti Pots have been associated with rare but severe infections. Only distilled or sterile water should be used and these devices must be cleaned properly after each use [(31)](#references-31). Adverse Reactions Dermatologic hypersensitivity with [guggulipid](/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/guggul) [(3)](#references-3) (SGPT)/alanine aminotransaminase with Ayurvedic formulations in one study [(47)](#references-47). Case reports - Lead poisoning, severe GI symptoms, and anemia with anemia, following use of ayurvedic medications for dermatitis, vitiligo, and diabetes [(39)](#references-39). - Acute liver injury and death from a formula containing heavy metals and volatile organic compounds [(43)](#references-43). - Oxytocic and abortifacient effects with Adhatoda vasica, an herb often [(25)](#references-25) [(26)](#references-26) [(27)](#references-27) [(28)](#references-28) [(29)](#references-29). - Fatal in the fetus with the ingestion of ayurvedic tablets by a pregnant woman.
