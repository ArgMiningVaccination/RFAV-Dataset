North Dakota covers 69,000.80 square miles and has a 2015 -estimated population of 756,927 people. As of 2010, North Dakota had 9.7 people per square mile compared to the United States at 87.4 people per square mile. According to the 2010 Census, North Dakota has 357 incorporated communities. Fifty -five percent of these com munities have 200 people or less. The state's largest Fargo Estimate) . In 2014, t he state's median age was 35.9 years. Eleven percent of persons live below the poverty level, compared to 13.5% nationally. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 88.6% of the state's population is wh ite, 5.5 % is American Indian/Alaska Native, 2.4% is Black or African American and 3.5% is of Hispani c/Latino o rigin (2015 Estimate) . There are five federally recognized American Indian Tribes located at least partially within the State of North Dakota: Mandan, Hidatsa, & Arikara Nation (Three Affiliated Tribes); Spirit Lake Sioux Tribe; Standing Rock Sioux Tribe ( bestrides North Dakota and South Dakota); Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians (including Trenton Indian Service Area ); and Sisseton -Wahpeton Oyate Nation (majority located in South Dakota ). The western half of North Dakota consists of many small com munities spread across thousands of acres of farmland, with farming as one of the primary sources of income. A \"Virginia -sized\", 24,000 square mile oil reserve of an estimated 4.3 billion barrels lies 10,000 feet below the surface of western North Dakota c reating an \"oil boom.\" Production rates of ND oil began to rise in 2004, but increased dramatically in 2007 with advancements in technology and higher oil prices. This led to dramatically increased population, which taxed the surrounding infrastructure and community -based systems. In 2015, expansion of oil production began to slow steadily, leading to economic shifts that have equally impacted these same communities. There are 52,035 civilian veterans in North Dakota, comprising approximately 9.6% of the adult population. North Dakota has two Air Force Bases which consist of 8,206 activ e duty and civilian personnel. As of May 2012, a total of 10,095 North Dakotans have been deployed since the 2001 terrorist attacks on America.

The Department supports the provision of services and care as close to home as possible to maximize each pers on's independence while preserving the dignity of all individuals and respecting their constitutional and civil rights. The Department is an umbrella agency headed by Executive Director Christopher Jones who was appointed by Governor Doug Burgum on Feb. 3, 2017. Comprised of over 2, 200 employees, the Department of Human Services is organized into four major subdivisions consisting of Medical Services , Behavioral Health , Administration & Support, and Program & Policy. The Department receives and distributes funds furnished by the North Dakota Legislature and Congress. The Department, through the ND State Hospital, Life Skills and Transition Center and Statewide Community Clinics (Human Service Centers), is a direct provider of human services and t he state institution for individuals needing inpatient psychiatric services.

The Division serves as the State Mental Health Authority (SMHA) , State Substance Abuse Authority (SSA) , and the State Opioid Treatment Authority (SOTA) . The Behavioral Health Division (NDCC 50 -06-01.4) is a policy division responsible for reviewing and identifying service needs and activities in the state's behaviora l health system in an effort to ensure health and safety , access to services, and quality of services . The Division is also responsible for e stablishing quality assurance standards for the licensure of substance use disorder program services and facilities and providing policy leadership in partnership with public and private entities . The Behavioral Health Division does not provide direct services, rather the role of the Division is to ensur e health and safety and access to a wide -range of quality behavioral health services across the state. Printed: 9/1/2017 11:33 AM - North Dakota Page 5 of 30 Printed: 9/1/2017 11:34 AM - North Dakota - OMB Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 09/30/2020 Page 29 of 224North Dakota 2018 -2019 Combined Behavioral Health Assessment and Plan 5 More specificall y, the Division has identified two primary functions in which its work falls: Regulation : The Behavioral Health Division is responsible for licensing all substance use disorder treatment programs in North Dakota, the regional human service centers, Opioid Treatment Programs, DUI seminar programs, and all psychiatric residential treatment facilities for children. Administration : The Division develops behavioral health policies and administers both federal and state funding to support the state's behavioral health system. The Division administers such programs as brain injury services, First Episode Psychosis services, problem gam bling, and the Substance Use Disorder (SUD) Voucher program. The SUD Voucher Program provides funding for individuals to access treatment. This service creates an additional opportunity to access treatment and recovery support for substance use disorders. As the SSA, the Division acts as the primary organization to administer funding related to substance abuse prevention. This includes the administration of the SAPT BG to develop a comprehensive primary prevention program that includes activities and servic es provided in a variety of settings. The Division also administers the SPF -PFS. Throughout the implementation of regulation and administration functions , the Divis ion has a focus on partnerships, workforce development and communication: Workforce Development : The Division provides training, technical assistance and consultation concerning best practice behavioral health prevention, intervention and treatment services to North Dakota citizens, behavioral health professionals, and behavioral health o rganizations (both public and private). The Division funds and assists in the planning for the annual Behavioral Health Conference, each of which are attended by over 300 behavioral health stakeholders. The Division has three staff trained and able to prov ide the Substance Abuse Prevention Skills Training (SAPST) on a regular basis to individuals working in community -level prevention across the state. Through the SPF SIG and SPF - PFS (and continuing through the SAPT BG), the prevention system's training and technical assistance staff has enhanced their capacity to provide trainings and technical assistance on the Strategic Prevention Framework and evidence -based strategies. Partnerships : The Behavioral Health Division works closely with a number of entities to ensure that quality, efficient, and effective behavioral health services are available statewide. These include (but not limited to) the Behavioral Health Planning Council, Brain Injury Advisory Group, and the Problem Gambling Advisory Council. The ND Substance Abuse Prevention System leads and is a participant in many state -level partnerships in an effort to eliminate duplication of services and streamline goals. These partnerships include all levels, from department directors (Governor's Prevention A dvisory Council), to program administrators (Prevention Expert Partners Workgroup), to data analysts (State Epidemiological Outcomes Workgroup). Other partners include the ND Cares Coalition, the Non-Medical Use of Pharmaceuticals Task Force, Healthy ND, ND Board of Realtors, Indian Affairs Commission, Injury Prevention coalition, and the State Suicide Taskforce. Communication : The Behavioral Health Division works to increase knowledge and skills of both professionals and the general public related to beha vioral health topics. This is implanted through a wide variety of communication mediums: print, electronic, social media, etc. The Behavioral Health Division updated its website and developed a social media platform via Facebook in the spring of 2017. In the fall of 2016, the Division published the \"North Dakota Behavioral Health Assessment: Gaps and Recommendations\". The purpose of the North Dakota Behavioral Health Assessment was to identify priority recommendations to enhance the foundation of the sta te's behavioral health system, with the goal of supporting North Dakota's children, adults, families and Printed: 9/1/2017 11:33 AM - North Dakota Page 6 of 30 Printed: 9/1/2017 11:34 AM - North Dakota - OMB Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 09/30/2020 Page 30 of 224North Dakota 2018 -2019 Combined Behavioral Health Assessment and Plan 6 communities in health and wellness, to reach their full potential. In previous years, the state's behavioral health system has received much attention and review, with stakeholders from multiple disciplines coming together initiating dialogue that would lead to effective change. Numerous suggestions, recommendations and priorities have previously been identified. This important work was considered throug h the development of this Behavioral Health Assessment. However, this Behavioral Health Assessment took into consideration some important factors that have not been previously reviewed: epidemiological data identifying the prevalence of behavioral health needs among children and adults in the state; a review of the full Continuum of Care (from promotion a nd prevention through recovery); and g lobal systems infrastructure perspective. The Behavioral Health Assessment identified the following recommendations as vital foundational pieces on which further efforts can continue to be made and be sustained: Continuous collection, analysis and utilization of comprehensive behavioral health data. Development of a formal Children's Behavioral Health Leadership group. Support substance use disorder early intervention services. Mental health promotion and early identification of mental illness. Continue to support public service delivery system changes relating to core services and population. Recognition of behavioral h ealth c onditions as a chronic disease. PUBLIC BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM The North Dakota Department of Human Services operates eight regional human service centers , the State Hospital and the Life Skills and Transition Center . During the 2017 Legislative Session, Senate Bill 2039 (NDCC 50 -06-01.4) further defined the purpose of the service delivery division within the Department of Human Services. This service delivery division is responsible for providing chronic disease manag ement, regional intervention services, and twenty -four-hour crisis services for individuals with behavioral health disorders. Each Human Service Center serves a designated multi -county area, providing counseling and mental health services, substance abuse treatment, disability services, and other human services. The Regional Human Service Centers are the access point for State Hospital admissions. Human service center employees also provide direction and oversight for services offered through county social service offices and other providers. Crisis lines are answered 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Contact information, including the counties served, is provided below. Delivering human services involves a partnership between the Department, counties, tribes, and service providers. In addition to providing direct services themselves, the regional human service centers also contract with private non -profit providers for crisis residential services, most residential services, as well as the Recovery Centers .

It is fully accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Care Organizations a nd is also Medicare certified. The North Dakota State Hospital provides service to individuals aged 18 year and older and is utilized only when it has been determ ined by the regional human service center to b e the most appropriate option. It serves as the safety net for the public system in North Dakota. The North Dakota State Hospital provides total care consisting of physical, medical, psychological, substance ab use, rehabilitative, social, educational, recreational and spiritual services through a variety of clinical and non -clinical staff. The goal of the treatment process is to implement appropriate therapeutic modalities at the earliest time so that the perio d of hospitalization can be reduced to a minimum. The sister facility to the State Hospital - the Life Skills and Transition Center - serves individuals diagnosed wi th an intellectual disability. Located in Grafton, the Life Skills and Transition Center provides outreach services through the Clinical Assistance, Resource, and Evaluation Service (CAR ES) team and the CARES Clinic. Services are provided to prevent admissions and readmissions and to assist in transitioning people to the community. In additi on, a team of applied behavioral analysts deliver behavioral assessment and intervention services to people with intellectual disabilities throughout North Dakota, including individuals dually diagnosed with mental illness and intellectual disabilities. ADDITIONAL RESOURCES IN THE STATE 'S BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM OF CARE PRIVATE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDERS North Dakota Century Code requires the he Behavioral Health Division to license substance use disorder treatment program s in operation in the state. Appr oximately 80 programs are licensed throughout the state. Because all substance use disorder programs are required to be licensed, there is the ability to identify the levels of services available in various areas of the state to identify gaps. This same information regarding mental health providers is not available because there is no centralized registry. LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH North Dakota's public health system is decentralized with 28 independent local public health units working in partnership with the North Dakota Department of Health. The 28 local public health units are organized into single or multi -county health districts, city/county health departments or city/county health districts. Seventy -five percent of the local health units serve single coun ty, city or combined city/county jurisdictions, while the other twenty -five percent serve multi -county jurisdictions. The majority of the multi -county jurisdictions reside in the western part of the state. In this decentralized approach, the units are required to meet state standards and follow state laws and regulations, but they can exercise their own powers and have administrative authority to make decisions to meet their local needs. North Dakota local public health units have a long history of providing personal and population based health services to residents in their cit y and/or county jurisdictions. The local public health infrastructure represents the capacity and expertise necessary to carry out services and programs. Therefore, the healt h units function differently and offer an array of services. The most common activities and services provided by local public health are child immunizations, adult immunizations, tobacco use preventions, high blood pressure screening, injury prevention screening, blood lead screening and Early and Periodic Screening Diagnosis and Treatment.

The four tribes are also funded through the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant (SAPT BG) to provide loca l-level, culturally -appropriate, evidence -based substance abuse prevention infrastructure. By partnering with Local Public Health Units and Tribes the state continues to align and leverage prevention funds, resources (including both local SPF SIG , SPF -PFS and SAPT BG funding) and priorities around the issue of underage drinking among persons aged 12 to 20. THE COUNTY SOCIAL SERVICE BOARDS There are fifty -three local county social service boards. The county social service board delivery system is county -admi nistered and state -supervised. The staff of county social service boards provide social support services primarily to the following target populations: children, adults and families, older adults, and those individuals with a physical disability. North Da kota Century Code requires e ach human service center to have a human services advisory group consisting of the county social service directors of the region served, the public health directors of the region served, two current county commissioners appointe d by the executive director of the department, and five additional members appointed by the executive director of the department. PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY SERVICES Protection and Advocacy (P&A) , a vital service in North Dakota, ensures the quality of servic es provided to consumers. P&A is an independent state agency established in 1977 to advance the human and legal rights of people with disabilities. P&A strives to create an inclusive society that values each individual. People served include infants, children and adults of all ages. The majority of funds for program operations are from federal grants. Additional support is provided by the State of North Dakota. There is no cost for services, however, P&A does implement general eligibility requirements, including that the individual must reside within the State of North Dakota. P&A has eight different advocacy programs that serve individuals with disabilities: 1. Developmental Disabilities Advocacy Program 2. Mental Health Advo cacy Program 3. Protection & Advocacy Project for Individual Rights 4. Protection & Advocacy for Beneficiaries of Social Security 5. Assistive Technology Advocacy Program 6. Help America to Vote Program (HAVA) 7. Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Traumatic Bra in Injury 8. Client Assistance Program P&A's staff comes from a wide variety of backgrounds. They are all trained to be knowledgeable about service delivery systems and the legal rights of people with disabilities.

Prevention services in North Dakota are delivered both directly by the SSA and through community organizations/groups/coalitions supported by the SAPT BG , SPF-PFS, Opioid STR, and other funding sources. Examples of services delivered directly by the SSA include the Prevention R esource and Media Center (PRMC) and community training and technical assis tance. In recent years, both of these services have expanded and been increasingly formalized. Training and technical assistance provision has become a key function of the substance abuse prevention system and the Prevention Resource and Media Center (PRMC ) is often the vehicle the assistance is delivered. Examples of services delivered at the community -level, supported by the SAPT BG include funding to tribal prevention programs and local public health units. The Division's Substance Abuse Prevention Syst em plans to enhance the level to which SAPT BG funds can be invested to support implementation of community prevention efforts that can achieve population -level changes. Both state and community -based processes are guided by the Strategic Prevention Frame work. Through the state's SEOW, ND reviews available data to ensure services address the needs of diverse racial, ethnic and sexual gender minorities. The Behavioral Health Division funds Tribal Prevention Programs in the state. These Tribal Prevention Programs are required to follow the Strategic Prevention Framework as they provide culturally -appropriate substance abuse prevention coordination and implementation of evidence based programs, practices and strategies. This work is one of the strengths of the ND Substance Abuse Prevention System - longstanding collaboration with the tribes in the state. The ND Substance Abuse Prevention System leads and is a participant in many state -level partnerships in an effort to eliminate d uplication of services and streamline goals. These partnerships include all levels, from department directors (Governor's Prevention Advisory Council), to program administrators (Prevention Expert Partners Workgroup), to data analysts (State Epidemiologic al Outcomes Workgroup). Other partners include the ND Cares Coalition, the Non -Medical Use of Pharmaceuticals Task Force, Healthy ND, Indian Affairs Commission, Injury Prevention coalition, and the State Suicide Taskforce. Through the SPF SIG and SPF -PFS, substance abuse prevention has been integrated into Local Public Health units across the state. This integration has been beneficial to the state's community -level substance abuse prevention system in building a sustainable infrastructure that can conti nue substance abuse prevention through continued support by the SAPT BG. A continuing need of the state's substance prevention system is the development and maintenance of the community -level substance abuse prevention infrastructure, even with th e enha ncements in recent years. Local substance abuse prevention in the state is relatively new to the use of evidence -based strategies. The rural and frontier culture also presents barriers due to limited access to trained workforce and long distances to resour ces. There are limited prevention training opportunities in ND, professional prevention workforce shortages, and no statewide prevention specialist certification process.

North Dakota does not currently h ave a statewide licensing or certification program for the substance abuse prevention workforce. Also, a formal community coalition network, registration, training or certification process does not exist in the state. The Division is currently receiving support from CAPT regarding the development of a statewide coalition network system. This system will ensure coalition coordination, provision of additional prevention trainings, and increase sustainability of SPF efforts. See Appendix A for the North Dak ota Behavioral Health Division Substance Abuse Prevention Strategic Plan 2016 -2020. EARLY IDENTIFICATION /INTERVENTION Early identification/intervention is a gap in the North Da kota behavioral health system. The Behavioral Health Division certifies and lice nses Driving Under the Influence edu cation providers and programs. There are approximately 50 licensed providers of the DUI education course in the state. In the 2017 ND Legislative Session, House Bill 1040 passed which gave the Behavioral Health Divisio n authority to write administrative rules setting a minimum standard for Minor in Possession education classes. This effort is i n early development. TREATMENT AND RECOVERY SUPPORT SERVICES PUBLIC BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM Mental Health Block Grant Criterion 1 Through the public behavioral health service delivery system, individuals diagnosed with a serious mental illness, in most cases, are provided service through the Extended Care Treatment Units in each regional human service c enter. Below are the core services offered through the Extended Care Treatment Units, either directly or through public/private provider partnership or contracting: Case Management : All individuals presenting for services at the regional human ser vice centers are screened during the intake or multidisciplinary case staffing to determine if they have a serious mental illness and meet criteria for case management services. Clients meeting the diagnostic and additional criteria are of fered case manage ment services. If consumers are interested in receiving such services, a case manager is assigned to work with them. The case manager begins the process of completing the Daily Living Activities (DLA -20): Adult Mental Health, a function al assessment with t he client. The assessment focuses on 20 daily living activities. The completion of this assessment determines what areas of daily living the client needs assistance with, level of case management service, assists with determining which services and support s the client wants and needs, and assists with the development of the person -centered treatment plan. Supported Employment and Extended Service : Case management staff work closely with Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) to offer employment support services t o consumers who desire to work. Those who go through the traditional VR Supported Employment Program transition into Extended Services. This is a service designed to provide ongoing employment -related support for individuals in supported employment upon co mpletion of training which may include job development, replacement in the event job loss occurs, job training contacts, and other support services as needed to maintain employment. In Printed: 9/1/2017 11:33 AM - North Dakota Page 12 of 30 Printed: 9/1/2017 11:34 AM - North Dakota - OMB Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 09/30/2020 Page 36 of 224North Dakota 2018 -2019 Combined Behavioral Health Assessment and Plan 12 addition, the Department has implemented the evidence -based practice o f Supported Employment in conjunction with the IDDT program at three of the eight regi onal human service centers. This model emphasizes rapid job search, zero exclusion and time -unlimited supports and has been m et with very positive results. Individuals in volved in the EBP model of Supported Employment can transition to extended services Other Supportive Services : Adults served through the serious mental illness system of care access supportive services through other units of the human service centers. These services include group, individual, and family therapy, psychological services, and medication monitoring. Community Residential Options : Housing options available to adults diagnosed with a serious mental illness who are receiving services through the regional human service centers include: - Nursing Facility - A twenty -four hour highly supervised facility for co nsumers with medical problems. The human service center provides consultation/technical assistance and case management as requested. - Long -Term Residential - Twenty -four hour supervised care providing room and board for five years or longer. The human service center provides or contracts for consultation/technical assistance and case management as requested. - Transitional Living -Twenty -four hour minimal supervision, six to eight consumers in a group setting, room and board provided up to one year. This is provided by the human service center or through a contract with a local provider. - Homeless Shelters - Minimal supervision, one night to several months as needed, room and board provided. The human service center provides case management as requested. - Single Room Occupancy - House managers live in the facility and provide minimal supervision. Peer support and case management is provided by the a gency operating the facility. The human service center provides case management as requested. - Supported Housing - Independent living arrangement with staff and financial support from the agency operating the facility. The human service center provides case management and financial support as needed and requested. - Independent Living - Independent living apartment rented by the consumer with case management and skills training provided if requested by the consumer. - Fairweather Lodge Program - a program dedi cated to improving the lives of adults with mental illness by providing safe, affordable housing, employment and social services. The program operates with minimal staff supervision and through peer support. Mental Health Block Grant Criterion 3 Key to t he children's mental health system of care is a strong partnership with families and integr ating services across systems. The wraparound process, which uses a strength -based approach to service delivery, is used in the public behavioral health service deli very system and is a method shown to improve the functioning of ch ildren who have complex needs. The process is used to help communities develop individualized plans of care. Working with the family, formal and natural supports (the child and family team) are wrapped around the family to provide them with the services/supports required to meet their needs. The wraparound process includes a set of core elements: 1) individualized plans of care, 2) culturally competent and tailored to the unique needs of fa milies, 3) parental involvement, 4) strength - based, 5) least restrictive setting. Below is the array of services provided through the Partnerships Program within the children's mental health system of care: Printed: 9/1/2017 11:33 AM - North Dakota Page 13 of 30 Printed: 9/1/2017 11:34 AM - North Dakota - OMB Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 09/30/2020 Page 37 of 224North Dakota 2018 -2019 Combined Behavioral Health Assessment and Plan 13 Care Coordination : Care coordination assists children with serious emotional disturbances and their parents with accessing the various services they need and helps them make informed choices about opportunities and services in the community. The care coordinator helps ensure the child and parents re ceive timely access to needed assistance, provides encouragement and opportunities for self -help activities, and provides overall coordination of services enabling the child and parents to meet their own goals. Case Aide : This service is designed to provi de behavioral management assistance and role modeling. Certified Mental Health Technicians help individuals stabilize, reduce, and eliminate undesirable behaviors that put them at risk of being served in restrictive settings. Certified Mental Health Tech nicians also help individuals observe and learn appropriate behavioral responses to situations that trigger their symptoms. Crisis Residential Services : This service provides a short -term, safe place to stabilize behaviors in a 24 -hour supervised setting. The goal is to promote rapid stabilization and return to the home or community. Substance Abuse/Dual Diagnosis Services : When a child diagnosed with a severe emotional disturbance requires substance abuse treatment, a substance abuse provider becomes invo lved in the team process. With enhanced services made available through the SAPT Block Grant funding for adolescent services, service choices for the teams to consider are increased. Flexible Funding : This service is available when no other resources are available to meet specific needs and threaten the child's ability to remain in the least restrictive setting. Other supports/services available within the children's mental health system of care include: Inpatient Psychiatric Facility: This service compon ent provides a short -term episode of care in a hospital setting for the purpose of crisis stabilization that cannot be managed in a non-medical setting, and for comprehensive assessment. The use of this service is reserved for extreme situations for youth who are showing serious acute disturbances or who have particularly perplexing behavior problems. Psychiatric Residential Treatment Facilities : A facility or a distinct part of a facility that provides to children and adolescents with twenty -four hour, th erapeutic environment integrating group living, educational services, and a clinical program based upon a comprehensive, interdisciplinary clinical assessment and an individualized treatment plan that meets the needs of the child and family. The services are available to children in need of and able to respond to active psychotherapeutic intervention and who cannot be effectively treated in their own home, in another home, or in a less restrictive setting. Voluntary Out -of-Home Treatment Program: The Volun tary Treatment Program provides out-of-home treatment services for Medicaid eligible children with a serious emotional disorder without requiring parents to relinquish custody. Therapeutic Foster Care : Specially trained and supported foster parents who p rovide a home for generally one child at a time. The child may remain in the foster home indefinitely. Intensive training for the foster parents is provided, along with on -going intensive support and back -up by mental health professionals and care coordin ators. Residential child care facilities : a less intensive service setting than a residential treatment center that provides 24 -hour care. Employment Assistance : Children of working age in the system of care can receive employment assistance through the In dividual Educational Plan process at their school. Once they have left the school system, Vocational Rehabilitation services are available. Partnership staff assist the child and family with accessing these services when needed. Respite/Parent Support : Respite services provide families of children diagnosed with serious emotional disturbances with periodic relief or back -up assistance. These services Printed: 9/1/2017 11:33 AM - North Dakota Page 14 of 30 Printed: 9/1/2017 11:34 AM - North Dakota - OMB Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 09/30/2020 Page 38 of 224North Dakota 2018 -2019 Combined Behavioral Health Assessment and Plan 14 may be on a planned or emergency basis and can be provided either in the family's home or in another sett ing. Intensive In -home Therapy : This service component provides crisis resolution and family therapy oriented services on an outreach basis to work intensively with children and families in their homes. Families that receive these services have a child who is at risk for out of home placement. The services are intensive with 24 -hour availability. Services include (but not limited to) skills training and counseling. Transition to Independence Program : The Transition to Independence Program (TIP) started on July 1, 2011 and provides transition to independence process - wraparound case management services to transition aged individuals who are at risk between the ages of 14 -24, at all eight of the human service Centers . The Transition to Independence Program also provides technical assistance to service providers and community partners who are working with transition aged individuals to assist in guiding youth successfully into adulthood. Other Supportive Services: Acute, Psychological Services, and psychiatric services are available through the regional human service centers. Mental Health Block Grant Criterion 4 Homelessness continues to be an issue in North Dakota. The st ate lacks sufficient affordable housing, especially for low and extremely low -income brackets . There is a severe shortage of homeless shelter options available in at least five of No rth Dakota's eight regions. The availability of housing options that serve people with differing leve ls of need is also very limited - transitional units, low demand housing, and supported permanent housi ng are in very short supply. Housing subsidy funds are limited and waiting periods of 6 months to more than 1 year are common. Some zoning laws in the state contain pr ovisions that make it difficult to construct group living facilities, which is the category most permanent s upportive housing projects fall into. The specific regulatory language often involves definition of \"non -household\" living, rules regarding the nu mber of unrelated individuals per unit, and the requirement for public hearings associated with conditional use permits process. Rental and cre dit history requirements create significant barriers for people to transition out of homelessne ss. Regions report that minimum credit scores of 600 are common for people to access housing. There continues to be barriers, particularly with HUD subsidized housing, for people with criminal histories and finding housing for individuals with a history of sexual offenses i s particularly problematic. In addition, the employment opportunities are decreasing in the areas of the state impacted by the oil industry, due to the decline in activity, but the housing costs have not shown a similar decline. This has resulted in less p otential for people who are homeless to enter the job market while the lack of affordable housing has maintained. The ND Housing Finance Administration Director reports that there is a continued shortage of affordable housing. Even with some decrease in t he oil industry activity, North Dakota's estimated population on December 21, 2016 was 757,952. This estimate makes North Dakota the state with the highest percentage growth rate in the nation since the 2010 census.1 According to North Dakota's Housing Fin ance Agency's Executive Director, affordable housing continues to be a concern statewide in which homelessness is often a result. According to Reuters (2015), though the fall in oil prices has led to a decline in housing demand and rental costs, the demand for housing still outpaces the supply in western North Dakota. There are no homeless shelters in the two 1 https://www.commerce.nd.gov/news/NorthDakotaPopulationReachesanAllTimeHighof757952Residents/ Printed: 9/1/2017 11:33 AM - North Dakota Page 15 of 30 Printed: 9/1/2017 11:34 AM - North Dakota - OMB Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 09/30/2020 Page 39 of 224North Dakota 2018 -2019 Combined Behavioral Health Assessment and Plan 15 major western North Dakota communities and the slowdown in the oil industry has led to an increase in unemployment. The most recent Point -In-Time (PIT) Survey conducted in January 201 7 found 1,089 people were experiencing homelessness on that night in North Dakota , including 991 adults and 178 children. Of these, 69 were identified has having a serious mental illness and 70 chronic substance abuse . However, d ue to the limitations with the survey, it is believed this data underrepresents the true picture of homeless in North Dakota. Eight regionally -based coordinators funded under the Projects for Assistance in Transition from Homelessness (PATH) Grant provide persons who are homeless or at risk of homelessness and are mentally ill or have a co -occurring mental illness and substance use disorder with intensive case management services including therapy, skills training, supportive residential services and coordinate obtaining other community mental health and addiction services from staff of the human service centers. Persons who are homeless and mentally ill are provided outreach services, screening for treatment services, housing services, and refer ral for health, education, and entitlements. Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant Priority Populations (excluding Individuals in Need of Primary Substance Abuse Prevention) Through the public behavioral health service delivery system, i ndividuals are seen for an assessment or through emergency services and then referred to the appropriate level of care, based on admission criteria as outlined in NDAC Chapter 75 -09.1 and current ASAM criteria. All levels of care and the admission criteria f or levels of care are based on the American Society of Addiction Medicine Criteria (ASAM) a nationally recognized standard. DUI Seminar and inpatient treatment are provided throughout North Dakota, but SAPT Block Grant funds are not used for the provision of these services. North Dakota faces significant workforce shortages at all levels of the behavioral health profession . Allocations from the SAPT Block Grant base funds for treatment services are allocated by a formula among the eight regional human service centers. Based on need, each center provides or contracts for appropriate services, offering a continuum of care. The regional human service centers screen all admissions for preference as required in 45 C.F.R. 96.131 at initial contact. All regional human service centers have toll -free phone numbers. If the client identified as being a pregnant woman or injection drug user they are scheduled or offered appointments within 48 hours. An Assurance of Compliance with Rules and Regulations is signed by all regional human service center directors and included with substance abuse contracts. The assurances stipulate the pr iority population requirements and the communication requirement with the BHD regarding their ability to admit pregnant woman. All regional human service centers are to provide preference for admission to treatment to pregnant women (who seek and are refe rred for and would benefit from Block Grant -funded treatment services). In the event a program would not be able to admit a client, the client is placed on a priority waiting list and interim services would be provided. Interim services may include pre -treatment groups, education, and case management. As identified in the assurance, North Dakota has a capacity management plan for pregnant women. Human service centers, upon reaching 90% of its capacity to admit pregnant women, shall provide written notification of that fact to Division within 7 days. If the human service Printed: 9/1/2017 11:33 AM - North Dakota Page 16 of 30 Printed: 9/1/2017 11:34 AM - North Dakota - OMB Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 09/30/2020 Page 40 of 224North Dakota 2018 -2019 Combined Behavioral Health Assessment and Plan 16 center does not have the capacity to admit or refer a pregnant woman to the clinically appro priate modality of care within 48 hours of requesting treatment, the human service center is required to : a. Place the client's name and case number on an active waiting list, b. Recommend and provide interim services for the individual as required within 48 hours of the request for treatment, c. Provide the Division with written notification immediately of the client's case number, the date treatment was requested and the status of offered interim services, and d. Provide written notification to the Divis ion regarding the outcome of the individual's admission status. If a client refuses treatment, the client's name need not be placed on the waiting list. Pursuant to 45 CFR 96.126, a client who is initially receptive to treatment, but who later cannot be located for admission into treatment or refuses treatment when notified of an available treatment slot, may have that client's name removed from the waiting list. Regional human service centers publicize priority status. This is found within their brochu re and on the department's web page at the following link: http://www.nd.gov/dhs/services/mentalhealth/index.html To ensure that interim services are provided to pregnant women in th e event a human service center has insufficient capacity to provide treatment services, a plan is in place. The eight regional human service centers are required and responsible to comply with all requirements of the SAPT Block Grant including capacity man agement and waiting list systems. The BHD worked with regional human service centers to create a signed Assurance of Compliance with Rules and Regulations outlining all activities required for receipt of SAPT Block Grant funds. Items included in this ass urance include: Capacity management -Intravenous Drug Users (IVDU's); Capacity management -Pregnant women; and Interim services requirements for pregnant women and IVDU's Interim services are intended to reduce the adverse health effects of alcohol and othe r drug abuse, promote the health of the individual, and reduce the risk of transmission of disease. For pregnant women, interim services shall include counseling on the effects of alcohol and drug use on the fetus, as well as referral for prenatal care. At a minimum, interim services for other populations shall include education on HIV and TB and risks of transmission, case management, referrals for testing to public health or primary physician, and alcohol/drug screening. When interim services are provided, the client will be seen at least weekly by a case management staff member who will provide education on a 1:1 basis. During this time, referrals to public health for testing and/or prenatal care and alcohol/drug screeni ng can be managed. In the event interim services cannot be provided, BHD will be notified of the client's name and case number and arrangements will be made for provision of services by another agency but to date, this has not been used. The BHD is res ponsible for monitoring compliance and a plan has been developed to conduct block grant compliance reviews biennially with each of the regional human service centers and compliance with these issues assessed. The plan also includes reports to be submitted to the BHD either immediately, within 7 days, monthly or quarterly. An independent peer review team Printed: 9/1/2017 11:33 AM - North Dakota Page 17 of 30 Printed: 9/1/2017 11:34 AM - North Dakota - OMB Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 09/30/2020 Page 41 of 224North Dakota 2018 -2019 Combined Behavioral Health Assessment and Plan 17 reviews 12 -25 percent of the human service centers annually and assesses compliance with requirements as part of the reviews. North Dakota currently has two women specific substance abuse treatment programs. These programs are North Central Human Service Center (NCHSC) and Northeast Human Service Center (NEHSC) and are providing services to pregnant women, woman and their infants, and women with dependent children from all regions of the state. The Division will be re -procuring these services in the upcoming year. TRIBAL CONTRACTS The North Dakota Behavioral Health Division continues to partner and work with the American Indian Tribes in the state to ensure culturally -relevant behavioral health services are accessible. The Tribes in the state are represented on many state coalitions/task forces, which the Behavioral Health Division leads or participates in, including the State Epidemiological Outcomes Workgroup (SEOW), Prevention Expert Partners Workgroup (PEPW), the Governor's Prevention Advisory Council (GPAC), Problem Gambling Advisory Council, Mental Health and Substance Abuse Planning Council and Olmstead Commission. The Behavioral Health Division allocates approximately 25% of the SAPT BG primary prevention funding to support community -level prevention efforts on the four federally - recognized Native American reservatio ns in the state. These Tribal Prevention Programs are required to follow the Strategic Prevention Framework as they provide culturally -appropriate substance abuse prevention coordination and implementation of evidence based programs, practices and strateg ies. These community programs implement the following strategies: information dissemination, education, alternatives, community -based processes and environmental efforts. This work is one of the strengths of the North Dakota Substance Abuse Prevention Sy stem - longstanding collaboration with the tribes in the state. The Division will also be taking over contracts for treatment/recovery services with the Native American reservations in the state, which were previously managed through the regional Human Se rvice Centers. Doing so respects the government to government relationship and allows the tribe to identify through data/assessment their highest priority needs. The Division is planning on furthering the development of partnerships between prevention and treatment efforts funded through the SAPT BG in order t o align and leverage resources. WITHDRAWAL MANAGEMENT Withdrawal management has been an area of focus for the state for several years. In 2016, t he North Dakota Department of Human Services' Behaviora l Health Division (DHS) requested technical assistance (TA) from SAMHSA's Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) to help the State identify opportunities to improve, enhance and expand the State's capacity for withdrawal and intoxication management se rvices throughout Region 7. In the 2017 ND Legislative Session, Senate Bill 2042 was passed which added clarifications to Century Code to ensure there is constant monitoring in jails, specifically related to social detoxification. Currently, t he Division is in contract with the three existing Opioid Treatment Programs (OTPs) in the cities of Minot, Fargo, and Bismarck to enhance withdrawal management services specifically within county jails across the state. These ND OTPS will be identifying a nd educating system partners within the correctional system, enhancing policies and procedures for withdrawal management and MAT integration completed for the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation and interested correction facility partners. O ther activities include Printed: 9/1/2017 11:33 AM - North Dakota Page 18 of 30 Printed: 9/1/2017 11:34 AM - North Dakota - OMB Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 09/30/2020 Page 42 of 224North Dakota 2018 -2019 Combined Behavioral Health Assessment and Plan 18 providing training and support for withdrawal management for correctional health facility partners. Also through the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant, medical detoxification services are provided via contract th rough the Southwest Human Service Center in Fargo, ND. PREGNANT WOMEN AND WOMEN WITH DEPENDENT CHILDREN IN NEED OF TREATMENT The 2015 North Dakota legislative session enacted a bill (SB 2367) related to the establishment of a substance exposed newborn task force for the purpose of researching the impact of substance abuse and neonatal withdrawal syndrome, evaluating effective st rategies for treatment and prevention, and providing policy recommendations. This task force was comprised of representatives from state agencies, the legislature, medical providers, nonprofit entities focused on children's health and wellbeing, Indian tri bes, law enforcement, and the foster care community. This task force developed a report with the following four goals: Collect and organize data concerning the nature and extent of Neonatal Withdrawal Syndrome/Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) from subst ance use/abuse in the state. Collect and organize data concerning the costs associated with treating expectant mothers and newborns suffering from withdrawal from substance use/abuse. Identify available federal, state and local programs that provide servic es to mothers who use/abuse drugs or alcohol and to newborns who have NAS* and evaluate those programs and services to determine if gaps in programs or ineffective policies exist. Evaluate methods to increase public awareness of the dangers associated with substance use/abuse, particularly to women, expectant mothers and newborns. The Division will be working in collaboration with the public behavioral health system to post a Request for Proposal for specific programs focused on best practice to treat pregnant women and women with dependent children in need of treatment. MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT North Dakota was one of the last two states in the nation to provide Opioid Treatment Programs (OTP). On August 10, 2016, Community Medical Serv ices began serving patients at the first OTP in Minot, North Dakota. As of May 1, 2017, they were serving 70 patients. Client demographics show an age range from 19 to 62. The state's second OTP opened in Bismarck, North Dakota, on March 8, 2017, and as of May 1, 2017, they were serving 20 patients. On April 18, 2017, North Dakota's third OTP opened in Fargo, North Dakota, and is currently serving 17 patients. Despite the availability of such programs, the majority of the state's population currently d oes not have access to evidence -based medication -assisted treatment (MAT) practices. The state's three OTPs are easily accessible to approximately 17.6 percent of the state's population, with the other 82.4 percent of the population needing to travel, som e around 300 miles, in order to receive this service. The Division continues efforts to partner with community stakeholders with the goal of increasing access to medication assisted treatment . The Behavioral Health Division was awarded the State Targete d Response to the Opioid Crisis Grant Opioid STR ) in May 2017. The Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant will continue to support efforts implemented through the state's Opioid STR. Training needs will be addressed through the Behavioral He alth Conference, agency presentations, webinars, and other training and technical assistance opportunities.

The Division continually strives to address the needs of people over time and across different levels of disability, and to apply recovery principles to the full range of engagement, intervention, treatment, rehabilitative and supportive services that a n individual needs . Recovery principles are also applied to health promotion and prevention services for those at risk of mental illness or of substance use disorders. In partnership with the recovery communities, the Division is making revisions to existing policies, procedures, programs, and services, and ensuring that all new initiatives are consistent with a recovery -oriented service system. Future strategic plannin g and resource development efforts will build upon existing strengths and continue to move the Division in the direction of promoting recovery as a core concept. By doing so, the language, spirit, and culture of recovery will be embedded throughout the sys tem of services, in our interactions with one another and with those persons and families who trust us with their care. North Dakota's First Lady Kathryn Helgaas Burgum has announced her priority and plans to work to erase the social stigma around addiction and spread the word that it's a chronic disease, not a character flaw. The goal of this RFP is to support the First Lady's platform of \"Recovery Reinvented\" through communication and mass media strategies, creating a social movement decreasing st igma surrounding the chronic disease of addiction. The Behavioral Health Division is working with the First Lady to develop and disseminate messages surrounding the Recovery Reinvented platform. These messages include: We can support individuals in recove ry and prevent individuals from developing a substance use disorder by developing healthy families, businesses, and communities. Reducing stigma will break down barriers to providing and receiving effective prevention, treatment, and recovery services. \"A nyone\" can become addicted. Addiction is a chronic, but treatable disease that requires medical intervention, not moral judgment. Other specific r ecovery initiatives include the following: Telephone Recovery Support : The \"Recovery Talk\", North Dakota's Telephone Recovery Support Program, was implemented statewide in June, 2008. The Department of Human Services currently contracts with ADAPT, Inc. a private agency located in Bismarck, North Dakota to administer the program. Recovery Talk is geared toward s providing additional support to individuals in recovery from substance use disorders who live in rural areas. Individuals receive a phone call on a frequency they determine from trained recovery coaches for a \"check -in\". The recovery coach provides sup port to individuals in the early stages of recovery and provides referral sources to access other community supports. In 2015, the program was expanded to include a 24/7 call in feature for participants to utilize anytime they may need additional support. Peer Support : The Behavioral Health Division is under contract with the University of North Dakota Center for Rural Health (the Center) to create and initiate the implementation of a strategic plan to increase the availability of all types of behavioral health workforce in all regions of the state. The Center will develop deliverables for the project that will include outcome and strategic r ecommendation reports and fact sheets/policy briefs. Implementation of the strategic plan will begin with the development of a state approved Peer Support Specialist Certification. The Center will facilitate the creation certification standards, developme nt of application and certification processes, and provide technical assistance to support the adoption of peer support services.

The CFN is a collaboration consisting of individuals, family members, and advocacy organizations dedicated to education, support, advocacy, and empowerment in the interest of promoting mental health. Go als of the CFN include consumers being well -informed of their choices and possibilities beyond those presently available and for mental health care to be consumer and family driven. Mental Health America of North Dakota and the Consumer and Family Network are members of the North Dakota Behavioral Health Planning Council and provide input into the planning of the behavioral health system of care. DATA/INFRASTRUCTURE - MENTAL HEALTH BLOCK GRANT Mental Health Block Grant Criterion 2 YOUTH : Over one in four ( 27.2%) ND high school students report feeling sad or hopeless almost every day for 2 or more weeks in a row so that they stopped doing some usual activities during the past year. This percentage was highest among high school females (35.2% compared to 19.6% males). According to the 2014 -2015 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, approximately 10.5 percent of youth ages 12 to 17 reported a major depressive episode in the past year. At North Dakota Human Service Centers (statewide), an average of 1,556 youth are receiving mental health services in a quarter (3 month period; average of four quarters; April 2015 - March 2016). Good mental health often contributes to good physical health. Likewise, the presence of mental and/or substance use disorder is fr equently associated with physical health disorders. 17.2% of ND high school students have a long -term health problem.2 Sixteen percent of ND high school students seriously considered attempting suicide at some point during the past year and 13.5% of made a plan about how they would attempt suicide.

Almost one in ten (9.4%) ND high school students attempted suicide one or more times d uring the past year.3 ADULTS : Approximately one in three (31.2%) ND adults report their mental health (including stress, depression, and problems with emotions) was not good on at least one day within the past 30 days. Similarly, one in three (33.9%) r eport poor physical or mental health kept them from doing their normal usual activities, such as self -care, work or recreation (within the past 30 days). 4 Approximately 17% of ND adults report they have been told at some time in their life that they have a depressive disorder (including depression, major or minor depression and dysthymia). 5 And, an estimated six percent of ND adults (ages 18 and older) have experienced a major depressive episode in the past year. 6 3 North Dakota Youth Risk Behavior Survey, 2015 https://www.nd.gov/dpi/SchoolStaff/SafeHealthy/YRBS/ 4 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 2014; ND adults ages 18+ 5 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 2014; ND adults ages 18+ 6 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, North 2015ND High School Students - Suicide YRBS Seriously considered attempting suicide (within last 12 months) Made a plan about how they would attempt suicide (within last 12 months) Attempted suicide (within last 12 months) Printed: 9/1/2017 11:33 AM - North Dakota Page 22 of 30 Printed: 9/1/2017 11:34 AM - North Dakota - OMB Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 09/30/2020 Page 46 of 224North Dakota 2018 -2019 Combined Behavioral Health Assessment and Plan 22 The percentage of North Dakotans with any mental illness in the past year is 16 .8 percent . While an estimated four percent have had a serious mental illness in the past year. Almost four percent of ND adults have had serious thoughts of suicide in the past year. 7 At North D akota Human Service Centers (statewide), an average of 6,102 adults are receiving any mental health services in a quarter (3 month period; average of four quarters; April 2015 - March 2016).8 The National Survey on Drug Use and Health estimates four perce nt of ND adults to have a serious mental illness, which equals approximately 22,556 individuals age 18 and older in the state. In 2015, the Human Service Centers identified approximately 2,200 adults with serious mental illness as receiving services, whic h comes to 9.7% of the population needing services. At times, it is appropriate and effective for inpatient treatment for individuals with mental illness. Conservative estimates suggest a need for 50 -60 adult beds per 100,000 population. Based on this estimate, North Dakota total need would be an approximate 350 -420 beds. The total beds currently available is right around 323. 7 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, North Dakota, 2013 -2014 8 Unduplicated count of youth and adult mental health clients and addiction clients - Jan-March 2016 16.8% 3.9% 6.4% 3.9% 0.0%5.0%10.0%15.0%20.0% Any Mental IllnessMajor Depressive EpisodeSerious Thoughts of SuicideReported Mental Illness within the Past Year among ND Adults ages 18 and older National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 2014 -2015 Adults with Serious Mental Illness (SMI) Receiving Services at a Human Service Center, 2015 Received Services at HSCs Did NOT Receive Services Printed: 9/1/2017 11:33 AM - North Dakota Page 23 of 30 Printed: 9/1/2017 11:34 AM - North Dakota - OMB Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 09/30/2020 Page 47 of 224North Dakota 2018 -2019 Combined Behavioral Health Assessment and Plan 23 Mental Health Block Grant Criterion 5 In planning for allocation of the Mental Health Block Grant funding in North Dakota, the Behavioral Health Division took many considerations into account, including needs and gaps identified in the Behavioral Health Assessment: Gaps and Recommendations report and recomme ndations provided by the Behavioral Health Planning Council. Below are ten recommendations provided by the Behavioral Health Planning Council: 1. Fund a comprehensive approach to behavioral health with an implementation of the full continuum of care model. 2. Fund and implement the Medicaid 1915 (i) amendment to the state plan in the 2017 -19 biennium budget. a. Fund peer support services statewide with a goal to ensure that any individual receiving case management has access to peer support services. b. Increase a vailability of long term employment supports for qualified individuals. c. Expand crisis intervention services including mobile crisis units state -wide, peer supports within crisis intervention services, additional residential crisis beds, and less reliance on hospitals to perform those services. d. Funding permanent supportive housing services for pre and post tenancy. 3. Fund Medicaid expansion and urge the legislature to reaffirm the expansion prior to sunset on July 2017 . 4. Department of Human Services shall c reate opportunities to strengthen advocacy voices to assist in making system change as identified in the Behavioral Health Planning Report by Schulte Consulting July 22, 2014. 5. Follow EPSDT Medicaid mandates, filling existing service gaps for required serv ices 6. Continued funding of the Housing Incentive Fund with a priority to support development of permanent supported housing . 7. Support the establishment of behavioral health courts with associated necessary public behavioral health provisions implemented, in cluding services for veterans see. 8. Ensure Human service centers provide services in a manner so all individuals who are eligible for services are able to receive an unconditional care model of services (zero reject) . 9. Ensure Evidence -Based or promising prac tices are provided with high fidelity quality assurances. 10. State agencies must be provided with state training to increase military cultural competency (how to communicate with veterans or those who have served). This training should also be made available to any providers of behavioral health services including private providers. ND Cares Network would be a good resource for the possible training materials. Following these recommendations and other needs and gaps in the system, the North Dakota Behaviora l Health Division plans to allocate the Mental Health Block Grant funds in the following way: Partnerships Program ( through the regional Human Service Center s): Mental Health Block Grant funding will support five Partnerships Programs located at the human service centers serving children with serious emotional disturbances. Peer Support: North Dakota is continuing to develop mental health peer support services throughout the state. First Episode Psychosis Treatment Program: The Division will continue work Prairie St. John's in Fargo to implement a Coordinated Specialty Care pilot program to provide evidence -based First Episode Psychosis (FEP) treatment services to individuals between 15 and 25 years of age.

Mental Health Criminal Justice Refor m: The Division intends to w ork with system stakeholders to decrease the criminalization of mental illness including development of diversion strategies within North Dakota. Aging and Mental Health: Through the Mental Health Block Grant, the Division plans to assist with training for long term care staff regarding mental illness and best practices in working wi th older adults experiencing mental illness. Workforce Training: In order to increase the utilization of best practices, the Division plans to utilize some of the Mental Health Block Grant to support the training of clinicians and other mental health stakeholders. One way of doing this is through the annual Behavioral Health Conference hosted by the Behavioral Health Division. Planning Council: The Division plans to utilize some of the Mental Health Block Grant to support the functioning of the state' s Behavioral Health Planning Council, including administrative support services and travel reimbursement for the federally required North Dakota Behavioral Health Planning Council. SPECIAL TOPICS /POPULATIONS AMERICAN INDIAN POPULATIONS The North Dakota Beh avioral Health Division continues to partner and work with the American Indian Tribes in the state to ensure culturally -relevant behavioral health services are accessible. The Tribes in the state are represented on many state coalitions/task forces, which the Behavioral Health Division leads or participates in, including the State Epidemiological Outcomes Workgroup (SEOW), Prevention Expert Partners Workgroup (PEPW), the Governor's Prevention Advisory Council (GPAC), Problem Gambling Advisory Council, Mental Health and Substance Abuse Planning Council and Olmstead Commission. The Behavioral Health Division allocates approximately 25% of the SAPT BG primary prevention funding to support community -level prevention efforts on the four federally - recognize d Native American reservations in the state. These Tribal Prevention Programs are required to follow the Strategic Prevention Framework as they provide culturally -appropriate substance abuse prevention coordination and implementation of evidence based pro grams, practices and strategies. These community programs implement the following strategies: information dissemination, education, alternatives, community -based processes and environmental efforts. This work is one of the strengths of the North Dakota S ubstance Abuse Prevention System - longstanding collaboration with the tribes in the state. The Division will also be taking over contracts for treatment/recovery services with the Native American reservations in the state, which were previously managed t hrough the regional Human Service Centers. The Division is planning on furthering the development of partnerships between prevention and treatment efforts funded through the SAPT BG in order to align and leverage resources. CRIMINAL JUSTICE POPULATIONS In the 2017 North Dakota Legislative Session, Senate Bill 2015 established a $7.5M investment in behavioral health services for people in the criminal justice system to improve public safety and public health outcomes. A primary goal of this effort is to improve healthcare outcomes and reduce recidivism by delivering high -quality community behavioral health services linked with effective community supervision. The Departments of Correction and Rehabilitation and Human Services are partnering with local agenci es and governments to deliver coordinated and Printed: 9/1/2017 11:33 AM - North Dakota Page 25 of 30 Printed: 9/1/2017 11:34 AM - North Dakota - OMB Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 09/30/2020 Page 49 of 224North Dakota 2018 -2019 Combined Behavioral Health Assessment and Plan 25 comprehensive services to people in the program. Using a certified paraprofessional workforce and an integrated, multidisciplinary approach, community -based agencies will provide a range of services including c omprehensive case planning, linking participants to services, peer recovery supports, and facilitating communication . The Department of Human Services has proposed four initial implementation sites for the community behavioral health program (Dickinson, F argo, Devils Lake, and Bismarck areas). Another goal of this effort is to c ultivate a network of community behavioral health providers to help meet treatment needs of people in the criminal justice system . In particular, Care Coordination and Peer Suppo rt Specialists are two core support positions needing to be strengthened. The Behavioral Health Division is currently under contract with the University of North Dakota Center for Rural Health to create and initiate the implementation of a strategic plan t o increase the availability of all types of behavioral health workforce in all regions of the state. The Center will develop deliverables for the project that will include outcome and strategic recommendation reports and fact sheets/policy briefs. Impleme ntation of the strategic plan will begin with the development of a state approved Peer Support Specialist Certification. The Center will facilitate the creation certification standards, development of application and certification processes, and provide t echnical assistance to support the adoption of peer support services. COLLABORATION WITH MILITARY SUPPORT ORGANIZATIONS In January of 2015, Governor Jack Dal rymple established the North Dakota Cares Coalition . The North Dakota Cares (ND Cares) Coalition includes a broad spectrum of more than 4 5 service providers and partners whose work touches the lives of Service Members, Veterans, Families and Survivors. Members share a common interest in strengthening an accessible network of support across the state, even though each entity retains authority over its own programs and services. The ND Cares coalition is dedicated to the strengthening of an accessible, seamless system of support for service members, veterans, families and survivors in the state. The c oalition's priority is behavioral health, defined as a state of mental and emotional being and/or choices and actions that affect wellness. The Behavioral Health Division staff is represented on this coalition as well as the executive committee. A milita ry data booklet was developed through the assistance of Behavioral Health Division staff to enhance the sharing of data showing behavioral health needs of the military population. In April 2017, the Behavioral Health Division and ND Cares Coalition coordinated a training to increase access to quality behavioral health treatment options, especially in rural areas, where service members may have fewer choices. The training focused on military culture and deployments, the challenges and difficulties oft en associated with military service that can affect service members and their families, and learn clinical skills that focus on specific evidence - based treatments to address some deployment -related behavioral health issues. These include post-traumatic str ess disorder, traumatic brain injuries and suicide. Participating providers were selected based on their location, with priority given to providers serving rural areas, along with their credentials and ability to ensure access by being able to accept new c lients. Participating behavioral health professionals have committed to providing the specialized evidence -based services for three years. The Behavioral Health Division developed a registry of ND Cares Behavioral Health Providers listing those providers w ho complete the training: https://behavioralhealth.dhs.nd.gov/ndcaresprovider Printed: 9/1/2017 11:33 AM - North Dakota Page 26 of 30 Printed: 9/1/2017 11:34 AM - North Dakota - OMB Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 09/30/2020 Page 50 of 224North Dakota 2018 -2019 Combined Behavioral Health Assessment and Plan 26 TREATMENT OF PROBLEM GAMBLING Treatment for individuals with a gambling disorder and their family is provide d via contract with Gamblers Choice, a program of Lutheran Social Services of North Dakota.

Narrative Question: This step should identify the unmet service needs and critical gaps in the state's current behavioral health system as well a s the data sources used to identify the needs and gaps of the required populations relevant to each block grant within the state?s behavioral he alth system. Especially for those required populations described in this document and other populations identified by the state as a prior ity. This step should also address how the state plans to meet the unmet service needs and gaps. The state's priorities and goals must be supported by a data -driven process. This could include data and information that are available through the state?s unique data system (including community -level data), as well as SAMHSA?s data sets including, but not limited to, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), the Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS), the National Facilities Surveys on Drug Abuse and Mental Health Services , the annual State and National Behavioral Health Barometers , and the Uniform Reporting System (URS). Those states that have a State Epidemiological and Outcomes Workgroup (SEOW) should describe its composition and contribution to th e process for primary prevention and treatment planning. States should also continue to use the prevalence formulas for adults with SMI and children with SED, as well as the prevalence estimates, epidemiological analyses, and profiles to establish mental health treatment, substa nce use disorderprevention, and SUD treatment goals at the state level. In addition, states should obtain and include in their data sources information from other state agencies that provide or purchase M/SUD services. This will allow states to have a more comprehensive approach to identifying the number of individuals that are receiving services and the types of services they are receiving. SAMHSA's Behavioral Health Barometer is intended to provide a snapshot of the state of behavioral health in America. This report presents a set of substance use and mental health indicators measured through two of SAMHSA's populations - and treatment facility -based survey data collection efforts, the NSDUH and the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS) and other relevant data sets. Collected and reported annually, these indicators uniquely position SAMHSA to offer both an overview reflecting the behaviora l health of the nation at a given point in time, as well as a mechanism for tracking change and trends over time. It is hoped that the Nation al and State specific Behavioral Health Barometers will assist states in developing and implementing their block grant programs. SAMHSA will provide each state with its state -specific data for several indicators from the Behavioral Health Barometers . States can use this to compare their data to national data and to focus their efforts and resources on the areas where they need to improve. In addi tion to in -state data, SAMHSA has identified several other data sets that are available to states through various federal agencies: CMS, the A gency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), and others. Through the Healthy People Initiative1 HHS has identified a broad set of indicators and goals to track and improve the nation's health. By using the indicators included in Healthy People, states can focus their efforts on priority issues, support consistency in me asurement, and use indicators that are being tracked at a national level, enabling better comparability. States should consider this resource in their planning. 1 http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/default.aspx Footnotes: Printed: 9/1/2017 11:33 AM - North Dakota Page 1 of 10 Printed: 9/1/2017 11:34 AM - North Dakota - OMB Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 09/30/2020 Page 55 of 224North Dakota 2018 -2019 Combined Behavioral Health Assessment and Plan 1 Step 2: Identify Unmet Service Needs and Critical Gaps within the Current System CONTENTS North Dakota's State Epidemiological Outcomes Workgroup ................................ ................................ ..............

The ND SEOW's mission is to identify, analyze, and communicate key substance abuse and related behavioral h ealth data to guide programs, policies, and practices. Administered by the Behavioral Health Division, the SEOW has built a broad representation of diverse partners and continues to provide leadership in identifying community data needs along with readines s to act for high need communities that will implement the evidence based prevention programming. The SEOW continues to collect, organize, analyze and develop data - sharing products (Epidemiological Profile, Data Book, Data Briefs, SUND website) with a continued look at expanding how alcohol and other drug abuse impacts other behavioral health issues. North Dakota's SEOW identifies, collects and organizes a variety of data types, including consumption rates, consequence indicators, data describing community readiness and perceptions, and is starting to identify and collect more data describing intervening variables, including risk and protective factors. This data covers a variety of populations including, middle school, high school, youth ages 12 and over, college students, adults (ages 18 -25 and 26 and over). Also, all data is available at the statewide level. Some data is available at the regional levels and very limited data is available at the county or city level (because of the rural nature of the s tate). The data sources utilized by the ND SEOW include the following (both national and state sources): National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH); Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS); Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBS); Youth Tobacco Survey (YTS); Adult Tobacco Survey (ATS); Crime in ND reports; ND of ND Community Readiness Survey; ND CORE survey; and Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS). A comprehensive Epidemiological Profile is dev eloped every other year. The data used in the Epidemiological Profile are at the aggregate state level, with limited sub -state analyses. A major challenge for the North Dakota SEOW is the limited availability of reliable and valid data at the local level. Limitation in the utility, reliability, and validity of data exist because of the state's small population. The challenge is even greater when considering epidemiological data from sub -state entities, such as counties and school districts. However the SEO W is continuously working to identify available sub -state data in order to enhance local needs assessment processes. The SEOW is currently developing a data sharing website, Substance Use North Dakota (SUND), modeled after Minnesota's SUMN.org in order to increase sharing of available data and support communities in applications for funding and data -driven planning. The SEOW's deliberation and review of the data on substance use consumption patterns, consequences of use, perceptions, and intervening varia bles resulted in the identification of priority areas in which the SAPT BG primary prevention funds should be allocated: (1) Underage Alcohol Use ; (2)Adult Binge Drinking; and (3) Prescription (especially opioid) Drug Abuse. Also produced by the ND SEOW is the Substance Use in North Dakota data booklet, which overlays some of the key data indicators from the Epidemiological Profile in a story -telling manner. This booklet, along with the Data Briefs produced by the SEOW, is targeted to the general population with the goal of raising the awareness of substance use issues and guiding programming and policy decisions.

The purpose of the North Dakota Behavioral Health Assessment is to identify priority recommendations to enhance the foundation of the s tate's behavioral health system, with the goal of supporting North Dakota's children, adults, families and communities in health and wellness, to reach their full potential. In recent years, North Dakota's behavioral health system has received much attent ion and review, with stakeholders from multiple disciplines coming together initiating dialogue that would lead to effective change. Numerous suggestions, recommendations and priorities have previously been identified. This important work was considered th rough the development of this Behavioral Health Assessment. However, this Behavioral Health Assessment takes into consideration some important factors that have not been previously reviewed: Epidemiological data identifying the prevalence of behavioral hea lth needs among children and adults in the state. A review of the full Continuum of Care (from promotion and prevention through recovery). Global systems infrastructure perspective. In addition to the review of previously developed reports focused on the state's behavioral health system, this assessment sought perspectives from service providers, key stakeholders, and consumers and families in both the state's public and private behav ioral health systems. This assessment identifies global recommendations, which when implemented, will set the foundation to support further enhancements to the state's behavioral health system in a comprehensive, efficient and effective way. This assessment is one piece of the puzzle on the road to a comprehensive and effective behavioral health system. The goal of this document is to identify, as a foundation, where stakeholders can align to develop and support a comprehensive behavioral health s ystem. See Appendix A for the summary of identified gaps. The gaps identified were based on the review of the system with the SAPT BG and MHBG supporting service delivery and efforts throughout the state. Without the SAPT BG and MHBG the number and scop e of identified gaps would be much larger. It was acknowledged that the foundational recommendations in the assessment require the involvement and collaboration of a variety of stakeholders. No one system can address these issues. The identified gaps/nee ds and related recommendations that were made have been identified as vital foundational pieces on which further efforts can continue to be made and be sustained . In general, throughout the behavioral health system of care, there are service shortages. PREVENTION AND PROMOTION (INDIVIDUALS IN NEED OF PRIMARY SUBSTANCE ABUSE PREVENTION ) Gaps and needs identified in the 2016 North Dakota Behavioral Health Assessment: Gaps and Recommendations: Workforce and best practices are still being identified, as mental health promotion and mental illness prevention are new to the state. Limited resources supporting mental health promotion and mental illness prevention efforts. Printed: 9/1/2017 11:33 AM - North Dakota Page 4 of 10 Printed: 9/1/2017 11:34 AM - North Dakota - OMB Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 09/30/2020 Page 58 of 224North Dakota 2018 -2019 Combined Behavioral Health Assessment and Plan 4 There is no credentialing process in the state for prevention professionals. Overall, promotion and prevention tends to not be valued as a priority. EARLY INTERVENTION Gaps and needs identified in the 2016 North Dakota Behavioral Health Assessment: Gaps and Recommendations: In general, gaps in collaboration and integration with the educatio n system, including early childhood and childcare systems exist. There is a need to identify the primary workforce (including credentials) responsible for implementing evidence -based screening efforts. There is not a consistent, universal screening uti lized in the state. At this time, it was identified that funding is a limitation in the widespread implementation of screenings and early intervention programs. Where screenings are occurring in the state, often there are issues with an efficient referra l process to further assessment and/or treatment services. In general, the current process of conducting assessments is not efficient or effective and this often delays the provision of services. TREATMENT Gaps and needs identified in the 2016 North Dakot a Behavioral Health Assessment: Gaps and Recommendations: There is a need to reduce the criminalization of behavioral health disorders. Also, reimbursement is not available for BH services for individuals in jails. As the field is moving to understand the chronic nature of behavioral health conditions, it has been identified that there are many limitations in the availability of community -based services (including housing, transportation, employment) to allow individuals choice of services in the least rest rictive environment and to support individuals throughout their life. In general, behavioral health services in the state are not integrated in service provision. Also, limited collaboration or communication with community or health organizations, including the utilization and exchange of data. Also related to this integrat ion, it was identified that when individuals change to a different level of care in service provision, the transition is often not fluid or seamless. Oftentimes the services available in a community are not widely known. Changes in services or processes are not always communicated widely to stakeholders and the general public. As has been identified in previous studies and assessments, there are gaps and needs in the behavioral health workforce. However, this limitation is not exclusively related to the number of providers. There are other considerations in this need, including the limitations in utilization of evidence -based practices among the current workforce. Also, there is a need for a single registry for mental health providers. Comprehensive care coordination is lacking across the system for individuals with a behavioral health condition. This includes a need for workforce capacity building about effective care coordination. There is a continued need for role clarification between the public and private behavioral health service systems to ensure the variety of treatment services are available to individuals.

PREVENTION AND PROMOTION (INDIVIDUALS IN NEED OF PRIMARY SUBSTANCE ABUSE PREVENTION ) Gap: Workforce and best practices are still being identified, as mental health promotion and mental illness prevention are new to the state ; Gap: Limited resources supporting mental health promotion and mental illness prevention efforts. Plan: Because Mental H ealth Block Grant dollars cannot be spent on primary prevention of mental illness, this rema ins a gap in the North Dakota behavioral health system. Through substance abuse prevention activities funded through both federal (including the Substance Abuse Pre vention and Treatment Block Grant) and state sources, shared risk and protective factors are a focus in planning and implementing evidence -based activities. Gap: There is no credentialing process in the state for prevention professionals. Plan: The Divisi on continues to work on increasing workforce development for prevention professionals in the state. In 2017, three staff at the Division participated in a train the trainer for the Substance Abuse Prevention Skills Training (SAPST) curriculum. Division staff will plan regular SAPST courses to increase the capacity of the workforce, while at the same time developing a plan to move to certification/ credentialing. Gap: Overall, promotion and prevention tends to not be valued as a priority. Plan: The Division continues to develop partnerships and communicate the importance of prevention to stakeholders and the general community. In recent years, the Division developed and disseminated a video on prevention basics and a newspaper insert, among other activities . Ongoing funding of local communities to implement substance abuse prevention efforts is also a strategy that is being implemented to increase the understanding of and support for prevention. EARLY INTERVENTION Gap: In general, gaps in collaboration and i ntegration with the education system, including early childhood and childcare systems exist. Plan: Through the passage of House Bill 1040 in the 2017 ND Legislative Session, $150,000 was appropriated to the Division for the purpose of establishing a children's prevention and early intervention behavioral health services pilot project in a school system of the department's choice. The Division is currently in the planning phase of this project. Gap: There is a need to identify the primary workforce (in cluding credentials) responsible for implementing e vidence -based screening efforts; Gap: There is not a consistent, universal screening utilized in the state; Gap: At this time, it was identified that funding is a limitation in Printed: 9/1/2017 11:33 AM - North Dakota Page 6 of 10 Printed: 9/1/2017 11:34 AM - North Dakota - OMB Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 09/30/2020 Page 60 of 224North Dakota 2018 -2019 Combined Behavioral Health Assessment and Plan 6 the widespread implementatio n of screenings and early intervention programs ; Gap: Where screenings are occurring in the state, often there are issues with an efficient referral process to further assessment and/or treatment services ; Gap: In general, the current process of conducting assessments is not efficient or effective and this often delays the provision of services. Plan: Through the passage of Senate Bill 2038 in the 2017 ND Legislative Session, a Task Force on Children's Behavioral Health was established. This task force will be looking at these gaps related to screening and early intervention specific to the children's behavioral health system. Through the SAPT BG, training and technical assistance is available to communities across the state on evidence -based problem ide ntification and referral. TREATMENT Gap: There is a need to reduce the criminalization of behavioral health disorders. Also, reimbursement is not available for BH services for individuals in jails. Plan: Senate Bill 2015 (passed in the 2017 ND Legislative Session) establishe d a $7.5M investment in behavioral health services for people in the criminal justice system to improve public safety and public health outcomes. The Departments of Correction and Rehabilitation and Human Services are partnering with local agencies and governments to deliver coordinated and comprehensive se rvices to people in the program by increasing access to services and expanding the provider workforce. Through the MHBG, the Division also intends to work with system stakeholders to decrease the criminalization of mental illness including development of diversion strategies within North Dakota. Gap: As the field is moving to understand the chronic nature of behavioral health conditions, it has been identified that there are many limi tations in the availability of community -based services (including housing, transportation, employment) to allow individuals choice of services in the least restrictive environment and to support individuals throughout their life. Plan: Senate Bill 2015 (passed in the 2017 ND Legislative Session) establishe d a $7.5M investment in behavioral health services for people in the criminal justice system to improve public safety and public health outcomes. One goal of this effort is to cultivate a network of commu nity behavioral health providers to help meet treatment needs of people in the criminal justice system. In particular, Care Coordination and Peer Support Specialists are two core support positions needing to be strengthened. The Behavioral Health Division is currently under contract with the University of North Dakota Center for Rural Health to create and initiate the implementation of a strategic plan to increase the availability of all types of behavioral health workforce in all regions of the state. The work in this effort will increase access to community -based services for all individuals. Through the MHBG, the Division continues to develop mental health peer support services throughout the state. To increase effectiveness of services for pregnant w omen and women with dependent children, the Division is working with the public behavioral health service delivery system to post a Request for Proposal for specialty women's services. Evidence -based treatment and recovery services will be a requirement a nd there will be a focus on substance exposed newborns.

Specifically, it is recommended that authority and resources be identified to require and/or incentivize data submission by programs, support the ongoing collection and analysis of the data, and communicate the data/results to stakeholders , decision -makers, and the general public.\" Gap: Oftentimes the services available in a community are not widely known. Changes in services or processes are not always communicated widely to stake holders and the general public; Gap: There is a continued n eed for role clarification between the public and private behavioral health service systems to ensure the variety of treatment services are available to individuals. Plan: The following recommendation was provided in the 2016 North Dakota Behavioral Health Assessment: Gaps and Recommendations: \" In the effort to enhance services available to support an individual's behavioral health, it is recommended to continue role clarification between the public and private behavioral health service delivery systems. T he public service delivery system's primary role as chronic disease management, regional intervention services and 24 -hour crisis services has been identified. It is also recommended that the public service delivery system continue to enhance building awar eness of these service changes. This may include increased communication to general public and stakeholders, holding regional meetings and providing information to consumers. \" Gap: As has been identified in previous studies and assessments, there are gaps and needs in the behavioral health workforce. However, this limitation is not exclusively related to the number of providers. There are other considerations in this need, includ ing the limitations in utilization of evidence -based practices among the current workforce.

The work in this effort will increase access to community -based services for all individuals. In order to increase the utilization of best practices, the Division plans to utilize some of the MHBG to support the training of clinicians and other mental health stakeholders. One way of doing this is through the annual Behavioral Health Conference hosted by the Behaviora l Health Division.

SAMHSA provides decision makers, researchers and the general public with enhanced information about the extent of substance abuse an d mental illness, how systems of care are organized and financed, when and how to seek help, and effective models of care, including the outcom es of treatment engagement and recovery. SAMHSA also provides Congress and the nation reports about the use of block grant and other SAMHSA f unding to impact outcomes in critical areas, and is moving toward measures for all programs consistent with SAMHSA's NBHQF . The effort is part of the congressionally mandated National Quality Strategy to assure health care funds - public and private - are used most effectively and efficiently to create better health, better care, and better value. The overarching goals of this effort are to ensure that services are evi dence -based and effective or are appropriately tested as promising or emerging best practices; they are person/family -centered; care is coordinated across systems; services promote healthy living; and, they are safe, accessible, and affordable. SAMHSA is currently working to harmonize data collection efforts across discretionary programs and match relevant NBHQF and N ational Quality Strategy (NQS) measures that are already endorsed by the National Quality Forum (NQF) wherever possible. SAMHSA is al so working to align these measures with other efforts within HHS and relevant health and social programs and to reflect a mix of outcomes, processes, and costs of services. Finally, consistent with the Affordable Care Act and other HHS priorities, these efforts will seek to unde rstand the impact that disparities have on outcomes. For the FY 2016 -2017 Block Grant Application, SAMHSA has begun a transition to a common substance abuse and mental health client -level data (CLD) system. SAMHSA proposes to build upon existing data systems, namely TEDS and the mental health CLD system develope d as part of the Uniform Reporting System. The short -term goal is to coordinate these two systems in a way that focuses on essential data elements and minimizes data collection disruptions. The long -term goal is to develop a more efficient and robust program of data collection about behavioral health services that can be used to evaluate the impact of the block grant program on prevention and treatment services perfo rmance and to inform behavioral health services research and policy. This will include some level of direct reporting on client -level data from states on unique prevention and treatment services purchased under the MHBG and SABG and how these services contribute to overall outcomes. It should be noted that SAMHSA itself does not intend to collect or maintain any personal identifying information on individuals served wi th block grant funding. This effort will also include some facility -level data collection to understand the overall financing and service delivery process on client -level and systems -level outcomes as individuals receiving services become eligible for services that are covered under fee -for-service or capitation systems, which results in encounter reporting. SAMHSA will continue to work with its partners to look at current facility col lection efforts and explore innovative strategies, including survey methods, to gather facility and client level data. The initial draft set of measures developed for the block grant programs can be found at http://www.samhsa.gov/data/quality -metrics/block - grant -measures . These measures are being discussed with states and other stakeholders. To help SAMHSA determine how best to move forward with our partners, each state must identify its current and future capacity to report these measures or measures like them, types of adjustments to current and future state -level data collection efforts necessary to submit the new streamlined performance measures, technical assistance needed to make those adjustments, and perceived or actual barriers to such data collection and reporting. The key to SAMHSA's success in accomplishing tasks associated with data collection for the block grant will be the collaborat ion with SAMHSA's centers and offices, the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors (NASMHPD), the National Assoc iation of State Alcohol Drug Abuse Directors (NASADAD), and other state and community partners. SAMHSA recognizes the significant implication s of this undertaking for states and for local service providers, and anticipates that the development and implementation process will take several years and will evolve over time. For the FY 2016 -2017 Block Grant Application reporting, achieving these goals will result in a more coordinated behavioral health data collec tion program that complements other existing systems (e.g., Medicaid administrative and billing data systems; and state mental hea lth and substance abuse data systems), ensures consistency in the use of measures that are aligned across various agencies and report ing systems, and provides a more complete understanding of the delivery of mental health and substance abuse services. Both goals can only be achieved through continuous collaboration with and feedback from SAMHSA's state, provider, and practitioner partners. SAMHSA anticipates this movement is consistent with the current state authorities' movement toward system integration and wil l minimize challenges associated with changing operational logistics of data collection and reporting. SAMHSA understands modifications to data collection systems may be necessary to achieve these goals and will work with the states to minimize the impact of these chan ges. States must answer the questions below to help assess readiness for CLD collection described above: Briefly describe the state's data collection and reporting system and what level of data is able to be reported currently (e. g., at the client, program, provider, and/or other levels).1. Is the state's current data collection and reporting system specific to substance abuse and/or mental health services clients , or is it part of a larger data system? If the latter, please identify what other types of data are collected and for what populations (e.g., M edicaid, child welfare, etc.).2.

North Dakota has an active State Epidemiological Outcomes Workgroup (SEO W), which was established in 2006. The ND SEOW's mission is to identify, analyze, and communicate key substance abuse and related behavioral health data to guide programs, policies, and practices. Administered by the Behavioral Health Division, the SEOW h as built a broad representation of diverse partners and continues to provide leadership in identifying community data needs along with readiness to act for high need communities that will implement the evidence based prevention programming. The SEOW contin ues to collect, organize, analyze and develop data -sharing products (Epidemiological Profile, Data Book, Data Briefs, SUND website) with a continued look at expanding how alcohol and other drug abuse impacts other behavioral health issues. The data source s utilized by the ND SEOW include the following (both national and state sources): National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH); Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS); Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBS); Youth Tobacco Survey (YTS ); Adult Tobacco Survey (ATS); Crime in ND reports; ND Department of ND Community Readiness Survey; ND CORE survey; and Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS). Data is reviewed annually to ensure programs and funding is targeting t he right areas (those areas impacting the most people or having the most public health impact, etc.). The work of the SEOW has set the following priorities for the substance abuse prevention system: (1) Underage Alcohol Use ; (2) Adult Binge Drinking; and (3) Prescription (especially opioid) Drug Abuse. SUBSTANCE ABUSE PREVENTION DATA COLLECTION AND REPORTING SYSTEMS Process Measures The Division's substance abuse prevention system has developed an Access reporting database, titled the Daily Reporting System (DRS) for internal use in order to record state -level prevention activities and the provision of training and technical assistanc e to communities across the state. It is designed to capture the process data (numbers served, resources created, technical assistance activities, etc.) needed for SAPT BG reporting and the evaluation of prevention programs and efforts. The Division also t racks statewide communication process measures including reach, frequency, web hits, etc. All substance abuse prevention community grantees through the SAPT BG are required to submit reports on process data related to their work. These process measures include the following: number of materials disseminated, number of people served, number of media efforts (including reach), number of contacts with policy -makers, etc. The most recent contracts for the Tribal Community Prevention Programs have moved to b e performance -based. Each month throughout their contract, they are required to submit a monthly report which summarizes process d ata on implemented strategies. Community grantees are encouraged to review their monthly reports to monitor implementation. A final report is also required which includes a summary of outcome measures, list of notable achievements and list of any barriers that impacted implementation effectiveness. This process data (both state and community -level) is reviewed at regular time periods (monthly, quarterly and annually) in order to ensure the implementation of prevention efforts is going as planned and to allow for adjustments in implementation to ensure success.

Through the state's SPF SIG and SPF -PFS the Division, through contract, was able to conduct a statewide Community Readiness Survey and a Young Adult Survey to further enhance data collection and efforts guiding prevention efforts. The North Dakota SEOW was established in 2006 and has the mission to identify, analyze, and communicate key substance abuse and related behavioral health data to guide programs, policies, and practices. Administered by the Division, the SEOW has built a broad representation of diverse partners and continues to provide leadership in identifying community data needs along with readiness to act for high need communiti es that will implement the evidence based prevention programming. The SEOW will continue to collect, organize, analyze and develop data -sharing products (Epidemiological Profile, Data Book, Data Briefs, SUND website) including consumption patterns and cons equences of the abuse of alcohol and other drugs, with a continued look at expanding how alcohol and other drug abuse impacts other behavioral health issues. TREATMENT AND RECOVERY DATA COLLECTION AND REPORTING SYSTEMS Process Measures The Division requir es all vendors by contract to submit reports with relevant process data. These reports are reviewed by the Division to ensure efforts are being implemented as they were planned. The public behavioral health service delivery system has an electronic healt h record which is where the TEDs data is extrapolated. This data provides the state information on who is getting treatment through the public behavioral health system, what treatment they participated in - all of which are process measures. Data summariz ing process measures through private behavioral health providers is nonexistent in North Dakota. Outcome Measures The data available through the public behavioral health system's electronic health record can provide some short -term outcomes, including the success of individuals while actively participating in treatment. Howe ver, the collection long -term outcome measures is a gap in the state public behavioral health system. This is an area the Division would like to request additional technical assistance.

This is both a billing and a clinical record system. Services are captured by service area and service type. There is a ROAP code manual updated as needed. Data for the SUD program are captured on an episode of care, ASAM level, and National Outcome Measures basis. Mental health services are captured on a service specific and duration basis. For all behavioral health services, the system provides both claims data and encounter data. Each center has a national provider identifier and if a specific Medicaid service r equires both the provider and the professional to be enrolled, both are completed. The system allows for unduplicated counts of clients within and across services. Services can be reported by clinician as well. Supervisory and clinician reports are gene rated routinely to provide administrative information. This system links with the state's Medicaid Management Information System. This system complies with Federal data standards and uses CPT/HSPCS codes. This system is used to produce the annual URS table reports for mental health services and national outcomes measures for the SAPT block grant. This system can capture client -level data. ROAP has reports generated routinely and are available on an electronic computer drive in aggregate. Specific unique reports are available through the Department's Decision Support Services Unit.

The Health Care System, Parity and Integration - Question 1 and 2 are Required Narrative Question 1. The Health Care System, Parity and Integration Persons with mental illness and persons with substance use disorders are likely to die earlier than those who do not have the se conditions.25 Early mortality is associated with broader health disparities and health equity issues such as socioeconomic status but \"[h]e alth system factors\" such as access to care also play an important role in morbidity and mortality among these populations. Persons with mental il lness and substance use disorders may benefit from strategies to control weight, encourage exercise, and properly treat such chronic he alth conditions as diabetes and cardiovascular disease.26 It has been acknowledged that there is a high rate of co -occurring M/SUD, with appropriate treatment required for both conditions.27 Currently, 50 states have organizationally consolidated their mental and substance use disorder authorities in one fashion or another with additional organizational changes under consideration. More broadly, SAMHSA and its federal partners understand that such fac tors as education, housing, and nutrition strongly affect the overall health and well -being of persons with mental illness and substance use disorders.28 SMHAs and SSAs may wish to develop and support partnerships and programs to help address social determinants of health and ad vance overall health equity.29 For instance, some organizations have established medical -legal partnerships to assist persons with mental and substance use disorders in meeting their housing, employment, and education needs.30 Health care professionals and persons who access M/SUD treatment services recognize the need for improved coordination of car e and integration of physical and behavioral health with other health care in primary, specialty, emergency and rehabilitative care settings in the community. For instance, the National Alliance for Mental Illness has published materials for members to assist them in coord inating pediatric mental health and primary care.31 SAMHSA and its partners support integrated care for persons with mental illness and substance use disorders.32 The state should illustrate movement towards integrated systems of care for individuals and families with co -occurring mental and substance use disorders. The plan should describe attention to management, funding, payment strategies that foster co -occurring capability for services to individuals and families with co -occurring mental and substance use disorders. Strategies supported by SAMHSA to foster integration of physical and behavioral health include: developing models for inclusion of behavioral health treatment in primary care; su pporting innovative payment and financing strategies and delivery system reforms such as ACOs, health homes, pay for performance, etc.; promoting workforce recruitment, retention and training efforts; improving understanding of financial sustainability and billing requirements; en couraging collaboration between M/SUD providers, prevention of teen pregnancy, youth violence, Medicaid programs, and primary care prov iders such as Federally Qualified Health Centers; and sharing with consumers information about the full range of health and wellness progra ms. Health information technology, including EHRs and telehealth are examples of important strategies to promote integrated care.33 Use of EHRs - in full compliance with applicable legal requirements ? may allow providers to share information, coordinate care, and improv e billing practices. Telehealth is another important tool that may allow behavioral health prevention, treatment, and recovery to be conveniently provided in a variety of settings, helping to expand access, improve efficiency, save time, and reduce costs. Development and use of models for coordinated, integrated care such as those found in health homes34 and ACOs35 may be important strategies used by SMHAs and SSAs to foster integrated care. Training and assisting behavioral health providers to redesign or implement new provider billing practices, build capacity fo r third -party contract negotiations, collaborate with health clinics and other organizations and provider networks, and coordinate benefits among multiple funding sources may be important ways to foster integrated care. SAMHSA encourages SMHAs and SSAs to communicate frequently w ith stakeholders, including policymakers at the state/jurisdictional and local levels, and State Mental Health Planning Council m embers and consumers, about efforts to foster health care coverage, access and integrate care to ensure beneficial outcomes. SMHAs and SSAs also may work with state Medicaid agencies, state insurance commissioners, and professional organizations to encourage development of innovative demonstration projects, alternative payment methodologies, and waivers/state plan amendments that test approaches to providin g integrated care for persons with M/SUD and other vulnerable populations.36 Ensuring both Medicaid and private insurers provide required preventive benefits also may be an area for collaboration.37 One key population of concern is persons who are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid.38 Roughly, 30 percent of persons who are dually eligible have been diagnosed with a mental illness, more than three times the rate among those who are not dually eligible.39 SMHAs and SSAs also should collaborate with state Medicaid agencies and state insurance commissioners to develop policies to assist those in dividuals who Printed: 9/1/2017 11:33 AM - North Dakota Page 1 of 4 Printed: 9/1/2017 11:34 AM - North Dakota - OMB Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 09/30/2020 Page 89 of 224experience health insurance coverage eligibility changes due to shifts in income and employment.40 Moreover, even with expanded health coverage available through the Marketplace and Medicaid and efforts to ensure parity in health care coverage, persons with be havioral health conditions still may experience challenges in some areas in obtaining care for a particular condition or in finding a provide r.41 SMHAs and SSAs should remain cognizant that health disparities may affect access, health care coverage and integrated care of behavioral hea lth conditions and work with partners to mitigate regional and local variations in services that detrimentally affect access to care and integra tion. SMHAs and SSAs should work with partners to ensure recruitment of diverse, well -trained staff and promote workforce development and ability to function in an integrated care environment.42 Psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, addiction counselors, preventionists, therapists, technicians, peer support specialists, and others will need to understand integrated care models, concepts, and practices. Parity is vital to ensuring persons with mental health conditions and substance use disorders receive continuous, coordinated , care. Increasing public awareness about MHPAEA could increase access to behavioral health services, provide financial benefits to individuals and families, and lead to reduced confusion and discrimination associated with mental illness and substance use disorders. Block grant recipien ts should continue to monitor federal parity regulations and guidance and collaborate with state Medicaid authorities, insurance regulators, ins urers, employers, providers, consumers and policymakers to ensure effective parity implementation and comprehensive, consistent communication w ith stakeholders. The SSAs, SMHAs and their partners may wish to pursue strategies to provide information, education, and technic al assistance on parity -related issues. Medicaid programs will be a key partner for recipients of MHBG and SABG funds and providers supported by thes e funds. The SSAs and SMHAs should collaborate with their states? Medicaid authority in ensuring parity within Medicaid programs. SAMHSA encourages states to take proactive steps to improve consumer knowledge about parity. As one plan of action, states ca n develop communication plans to provide and address key issues. Another key part of integration will be defining performance and outcome measures. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and partners have developed the National Quality Strategy, which includes i nformation and resources to help promote health, good outcomes, and patient engagement. SAMHSA's National Behavioral Health Quality Fram ework includes core measures that may be used by providers and payers.43 SAMHSA recognizes that certain jurisdictions receiving block grant funds ? including U.S. Territories, tribal entities and those jurisdictions that have signed a Compact of Free Association with the U nited States and are uniquely impacted by certain Medicaid provisions or are ineligible to participate in certain programs.44 However, these jurisdictions should collaborate with federal agencies and their governmental and non -governmental partners to expand access and coverage. Furthermore, the jurisdiction should ensure integration of prevention, treatment, and recovery support for persons with, or at risk of, mental and substance use disorders. 25 BG Druss et al.

Describe how the state integrates mental health and primary health care, including services for individuals with co -occurring mental and substance use disorders, in primary care settings or arrangements to provide primary and specialty care services i n community -based mental and substance use disorders settings. North Dakota does not have adequate integration of mental health and primary health care. There is some practice of providing specialty care services in primary care settings and some primary care services in the community mental health clinics. There is some telehealth behavioral health services for primary care and given to critical access hospitals. Federally qualified health clinics have specialty services on site. The community mental health centers partner with public health and certain primary care clinics for medical services to the vulnerable and needy. 2. Describe how the state provide services and supports towards integrated systems of care for individuals and families with co - occurring mental and substance use disorders, including management, funding, payment strategies that foster co -occurring capability. The community mental health centers have applied an objective tool measuring the integration of services for co -occurring disorders with demonstrated average capacity and an identified set of goals for improvement. 75% of clients served in the community mental health centers have co -occurring disorders and thus treatment models and care delivery have adapted to meet this need. 3.

Health Disparities - Requested Narrative Question In accordance with the HHS Action Plan to Reduce Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities45, Healthy People, 202046, National Stakeholder Strategy for Achieving Health Equity47, and other HHS and federal policy recommendations, SAMHSA expects block grant dollars to support equity in access, services provided, and behavioral health outcomes among individuals of all cultures, sexual/gender minoriti es, orientation and ethnicities. Accordingly, grantees should collect and use data to: (1) identify subpopulations (i.e., racial, ethnic, limited English spea king, tribal, sexual/gender minority groups, etc.) vulnerable to health disparities and (2) implement strategies to decrease the disparitie s in access, service use, and outcomes both within those subpopulations and in comparison to the general population. One strategy for addressing health disparities is use of the recently revised National Standards for Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services in Healt h and Health Care (CLAS)48. The Action Plan to Reduce Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities, which the HHS Secretary released in April 2011, outlines goal s and actions that HHS agencies, including SAMHSA, will take to reduce health disparities among racial and ethnic minorities. Agencies are required to assess the impact of their policies and programs on health disparities. The HHS Secretary's top priority in the Action Plan is to \"assess and heighten the impact of all HHS policies, programs, proc esses, and resource decisions to reduce health disparities. HHS leadership will assure that program grantees, as applicable, will be required to submit health disparity impact statements as part of their grant applications. Such statements can inform future HHS investments and policy goals, an d in some instances, could be used to score grant applications if underlying program authority permits.\"49 Collecting appropriate data is a critical part of efforts to reduce health disparities and promote equity. In October 2011, H HS issued final standards on the collection of race, ethnicity, primary language, and disability status50. This guidance conforms to the existing Office of Management and Budget (OMB) directive on racial/ethnic categories with the expansion of intra -group, detailed data for the Latino and the Asian -American/Pacific Islander populations51. In addition, SAMHSA and all other HHS agencies have updated their limited English proficiency plans and, accordingly, will expect block grant dollars to support a reduction in disparities related to access, service use, and outcomes that are associated with limited English proficiency. These three departmental initiatives, along with SAMHSA's and HHS's attention to special service needs and disparities within tribal populations, LGBT populations, and women and girls, provide the foundation for addressing health disparities in the service delivery system. States provide behavioral health services to these individuals with state block grant dollars. While the block grant generally requires the use of evidence -based and promising practices, it is important to note that many of these practices have not been normed on various diverse racial and ethnic populations. States should strive to implement evidence -based and promising practices in a manner that meets the needs of the populations they serve. In the block grant application, states define the populations they intend to serve. Within these populations of focus are subpopulations that may have disparate access to, use of, or outcomes from provided services. These disparities may be the result of differences in insurance coverage, language, beliefs, norms, values, and/or socioeconomic factors specific to that subpopulation. For instance, lack of Spanish primary care services may contribute to a heightened risk for metabolic disorders among Latino adults with SMI; and American Indian/Alaska Native youth may have an increased incidence of underage binge drinking due to coping patterns related to historical trauma within the Ame rican Indian/Alaska Native community. While these factors might not be pervasive among the general population served by the block grant, they may be predominant among subpopulations or groups vulnerable to disparities. To address and ultimately reduce disparities, it is important for states to have a detailed understanding of who is and is no t being served within the community, including in what languages, in order to implement appropriate outreach and engagement strategies for diverse populations. The types of services provided, retention in services, and outcomes are critical measures of quality and outcomes of care for diverse groups. For states to address the potentially disparate impact of their block grant funded efforts, they will address access, use, and ou tcomes for subpopulations. 45 http://www.minorityhealth.hhs.gov/npa/files/Plans/HHS/HHS_Plan_complete.pdf 46 http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/default.aspx -ethnicity Printed: 9/1/2017 11:33 AM North Dakota Page 1 of 2 Printed: 9/1/2017 11:34 AM - North Dakota - OMB Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 09/30/2020 Page 93 of 224Please respond to the following items: 1.

Innovation in Purchasing Decisions - Requested Narrative Question While there are different ways to define value -based purchasing, the purpose is to identify services, payment arrangements, incentives, and players that can be included in directed strategies using purchasing practices that are aimed at improving the value of healt h care services. In short, health care value is a function of both cost and quality: Health Care Value = Quality ? Cost, (V = Q ? C) SAMHSA anticipates that the movement toward value based purchasing will continue as delivery system reforms continue to shape states systems. The identification and replication of such value -based strategies and structures will be important to the development of behavioral health systems and services. There is increased interest in having a better understanding of the evidence that supports the delivery of medical and specia lty care including M/SUD services. Over the past several years, SAMHSA has collaborated with CMS, HRSA, SMAs, state behavioral health authoritie s, legislators, and others regarding the evidence of various mental and substance misuse prevention, treatment, and recovery support services . States and other purchasers are requesting information on evidence -based practices or other procedures that result in better health outcomes for individuals and the general population. While the emphasis on evidence -based practices will continue, there is a need to develop and create new interventions and technologies and in turn, to establish the evidence. SAMHSA supports states' use of the block grants for this purpose. The NQF and the IOM recommend that evidence play a critical role in designing health benefits for individuals enrolled in commerc ial insurance, Medicaid, and Medicare. To respond to these inquiries and recommendations, SAMHSA has undertaken several activities. NREPP assesses the research evaluating an intervention's impact on outcomes and provides information on available resources to facilitate the effective dissemination a nd implementation of the program. NREPP ratings take into account the methodological rigor of evaluation studies, the size of a program's impact on an outcome, the degree to which a program was implemented as designed, and the strength of a program's conceptual framework. For each intervention reviewed, NREPP publishes a report called a program profile on this website. You will find research on the effectiveness of p rograms as reviewed and rated by NREPP certified reviewers. Each profile contains easily understandable ratings for individual outcomes based on solid evidence that indicates whether a program achieved its goals. NREPP is not intended to be an exhaustive listing of all evidence -based practices in existence. SAMHSA reviewed and analyzed the current evidence for a wide range of interventions for individuals with mental illness and s ubstance use disorders, including youth and adults with chronic addiction disorders, adults with SMI, and children and youth with SED. The evidence builds on the evidence and consensus standards that have been developed in many national reports over the last decade or more. These include reports by the Surgeon General52, The New Freedom Commission on Mental Health53, the IOM54, and the NQF55. The activity included a systematic assessment of the current research findings for the effectiveness of the services using a strict set of evidentiar y standards. This series of assessments was published in \"Psychiatry Online.\"56 SAMHSA and other federal partners, the HHS' Administration for Children and Families, Office for Civil Rights, and CMS, have used this information to sponsor technical expert panels that provide specific recomme ndations to the behavioral health field regarding what the evidence indicates works and for whom, to identify specific strategies for embeddi ng these practices in provider organizations, and to recommend additional service research. In addition to evidence -based practices, there are also many promising practices in various stages of development. Anecdotal evidence and program data indicate effectiveness for these services. As these practices continue to be evaluated, the evidence is collected to establish their efficacy and to advance the knowledge of the field. SAMHSA's Treatment Improvement Protocol Series (TIPS)57 are best practice guidelines for the SUD treatment. The CSAT draws on the experience and knowledge of clinical, research, and administrative experts to produce the TIPS, which are distributed to a gr owing number of facilities and individuals across the country. The audience for the TIPS is expanding beyond public and private SUD treatment facilities as alcohol and other drug disorders are increasingly recognized as a major health problem. SAMHSA's Evidence -Based Practice Knowledge Informing Transformation (KIT)58 was developed to help move the latest information available on effective behavioral health practices into community -based service delivery. States, communities, administrators, practitioners, consumers of mental health care, and their family members can use KIT to design and implement behavioral health practices that work. KIT, part of SAMHSA's priority initiative on Behavioral Health Workforce in Primary and Specialty Care Settings, covers getting started, building t he program, training frontline staff, and evaluating the program.

Each KIT outlines the essential components of the evidence -based practice and provides suggestions collected from those who have successfully implemented them. SAMHSA is interested in whether and how states are using evidence in their purchasing decisions, educating policymakers, or s upporting providers to offer high quality services. In addition, SAMHSA is concerned with what additional information is needed by SMHAs and SSAs in their efforts to continue to shape their and other purchasers' decisions regarding M/SUD services. 52 United States Public Health Service Office of the Surgeon General (1999).

Evidence -Based Practices for Early Interventions to Address Early Serious Mental Illness (ESMI) - 10 percent set aside - Required MHBG Narrative Question Much of the mental health treatment and recovery are focused on the later stages of illness, intervening only when things hav e reached the level of a crisis. While this kind of treatment is critical, it is also costly in terms of increased financial burdens for public m ental health systems, lost economic productivity, and the toll taken on individuals and families. There are growing concerns among consumers and family members that the mental health system needs to do more when people first experience these conditions to prevent long -term adverse consequences. Early intervention* is critical to treating mental illness before it can cause tragic results like serious impairment, unemployment , homelessness, poverty, and suicide. The duration of untreated mental illness, defined as the time interval between the onset of a mental di sorder and when an individual gets into treatment, has been a predictor of outcome across different mental illnesses. Evidence indicates that a prolonged duration of untreated mental illness may be viewed as a negative prognostic factor for those who are diagnosed with mental illness. Earli er treatment and interventions not only reduce acute symptoms, but may also improve long -term prognosis. States may implement models that have demonstrated efficacy, including the range of services and principles identified by Nat ional Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) via its Recovery After an Initial Schizophrenia Episode (RAISE) initiative. Utilizing these principles, regardless of the amount of investment, and by leveraging funds through inclusion of services reimbursed by Medicaid or private insurance, stat es should move their system to address the needs of individuals with a first episode of psychosis (FEP). NIMH sponsored a set of studies beginning in 2008, focusing on the early identification and provision of evidence -based treatments to persons experiencing FEP the RAISE model). The NIMH RAISE studies, as well as similar early intervention programs tested worldwide, consist of multiple evidence -based treatment components used in tandem as part of a CSC model, and have been shown to improve symptoms, reduce relapse, and improved outcomes. State shall expend not less than 10 percent of the amount the State receives for carrying out this section for each fiscal ye ar to support evidence - based programs that address the needs of individuals with early serious mental illness, including psychotic disorders, regard less of the age of the individual at onset. In lieu of expending 10 percent of the amount the State receives under this section for a fiscal year as required a state may elect to expend not less than 20 percent of such amount by the end of such succeeding fiscal year. * MHBG funds cannot be used for primary prevention activities. States cannot use MHBG funds for prodromal symptoms (specific group of symptoms that may precede the onset and diagnosis of a mental illness) and/or those who are not diagnosed with a SMI.

Describe how the state engages consumers and their caregivers in making health care decisions, and enhance communication. State encourages consumers and caregivers in making health care decisions through a shared decision making model, engagement services, and specific education and encouragement for advance planning with specifically documented advance directives. Shared decision making is a method of communication within the broad context of person -centered care. All contracts for behavioral health services through the Behavioral Health Division require vendors to be person -centered. 4. Describe the person -centered planning process in your state.

Please indicate areas of technical assistance needed related to this section. Environmental Factors and Plan 5. Person Centered Planning (PCP) - Required MHBG Narrative Question States must engage adults with a serious mental illness or children with a serious emotional disturbance and their caregivers where appropriate in making health care decisions, including activities that enhance communication among individuals, families, caregivers, and treatment providers. Person -centered planning is a process through which individuals develop their plan of service. The PCP may include a representative who the person has freely chosen, and/or who is authorized to make personal or health decisions for the person. The PCP may i nclude family members, legal guardians, friends, caregivers and others that the person or his/her representative wishes to include. The PCP should involve the person receiving services and supports to the maximum extent possible, even if the person has a legal representative. The PCP approach identifies the person 's strengths, goals, preferences, needs and desired outcome. The role of state and agency workers (for example, options counselors, support brokers, social workers, peer support workers, and others) in the PCP process is to enable and assist peo ple to identify and access a unique mix of paid and unpaid services to meet their needs and provide support during planning. The person 's goals and preferences in areas such as recreation, transportation, friendships, therapies, home, employment, family relationships, and treatments are part of a written plan that is consistent with the person 's needs and desires.

Does the state have any activities related to this section that you would like to highlight? Please indicate areas of technical assistance needed to this section. Environmental Factors and Plan 6. Self -Direction - Requested Narrative Question In self -direction - also known as self -directed care - a service user or \"participant\" controls a flexible budget, purchasing goods and services to achieve personal recovery goals developed through a person -centered planning process. While this is not an allowable use of Block Grant Funds,the practice has shown to provide flexible supports for an individual's service. The self -direction budget may comprise the service dollars that would have been used to reimburse an individual's traditional mental health care, or it may be a smaller fixed amount th at supplements a mental health benefit. In self -direction, the participant allocates the budget in a manner of his or her choosing within program guidelines. The participant is encouraged to think creatively about setting goals and is given a significant amount of freedom to work toward those goals. Purchases can range from computers and bicycles to dental care and outpatient mental health treatment. Typically, a specially trained coach or broker supports the participant to identify resources, chart progress, and think crea tively about the planning and budgeting processes. Often a peer specialist who has received additional training in self -direction performs the broker role. The broker or a separate agency assists the participant with financial management details such as budget tracking, holding and di sbursing funds, and hiring and payroll logistics. Self -direction arrangements take different forms throughout the United States and are housed and administered in a variety of entities, including county and state behavioral health authorities, managed care companies, social service ag encies, and advocacy organizations. Self-direction is based on the premise that people with disabilities can and should make their own decisions about the supports an d services they receive. Hallmarks of self -direction include voluntary participation, individual articulation of preferences and choices, and participant responsibility. In recent years, physical and mental health service systems have placed increasing emphasis on person -centered approaches to service delivery and organization. In this context, self -direction has emerged as a promising practice to support recovery and well -being for persons with mental health conditions. A small but growing evidence base has documented self -direction's impact on quality of life, community tenure, and psychological well -being.

Program Integrity - Required Narrative Question SAMHSA has placed a strong emphasis on ensuring that block grant funds are expended in a manner consistent with the statutory and regulatory framework. This requires that SAMHSA and the states have a strong approach to assuring program integrity. Currentl y, the primary goals of SAMHSA program integrity efforts are to promote the proper expenditure of block grant funds, improve block grant pro gram compliance nationally, and demonstrate the effective use of block grant funds. While some states have indicated an interest in using block grant funds for individual co -pays deductibles and other types of co -insurance for behavioral health services, SAMHSA reminds states of restrictions on the use of block grant funds outlined in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 300x -5 and 300x -31, including cash payments to intended recipients of health services and providing financial assistance to any entity other than a public or nonprofit private entity. Under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300x -55(g), SAMHSA periodically conducts site visits to MHBG and SABG grantees to evaluate program and fiscal management. States will need to develop specifi c policies and procedures for assuring compliance with the funding requirements. Since MHBG funds can only be used for authorized services m ade available to adults with SMI and children with SED and SABG funds can only be used for individuals with or at risk for SUD. SAMHSA guid ance on the use of block grant funding for co -pays, deductibles, and premiums can encouraged to review the guidance and request any needed technical assistance to assure the appropriate use of such funds. The MHBG and SABG resources are to be used to support, not supplant, services that will be covered through the private and pu blic insurance. In addition, SAMHSA will work with CMS and states to identify strategies for sharing data, protocols, and information to assi st our program integrity efforts. Data collection, analysis, and reporting will help to ensure that MHBG and SABG funds are allocated to sup port evidence -based, culturally competent programs, substance use disorder prevention, treatment and recovery programs, and activities for adults with SMI and children with SED. States traditionally have employed a variety of strategies to procure and pay for behavioral health services funded by the MH BG and SABG. State systems for procurement, contract management, financial reporting, and audit vary significantly. These strategies may include : (1) appropriately directing complaints and appeals requests to ensure that QHPs and Medicaid programs are including essential health benefits ( EHBs) as per the state benchmark plan; (2) ensuring that individuals are aware of the covered M/SUD benefits; (3) ensuring that consumers of M /SUD services have full confidence in the confidentiality of their medical information; and (4) monitoring the use of behavioral health ben efits in light of utilization review, medical necessity, etc. Consequently, states may have to become more proactive in ensuring that state -funded providers are enrolled in the Medicaid program and have the ability to determine if clients are enrolled or eligible to enroll in Medicaid. Additionally, compliance review and audit protocols may need to be revised to provide for increased tests of client eligibility and enrollm ent.

How many consultation sessions has the state conducted with federally recognized tribes? 2. What specific concerns were raised during the consultation session(s) noted above? Does the state have any activites related to this section that you would like to highlight? The North Dakota Behavioral Health Division continues to partner and work with the American Indian Tribes in the state to ens ure culturally -relevant behavioral health services are accessible. The Tribes in the state are represented on many state coalitions/task forces, which the Behavioral Health Division leads or participates in, including the State Epidemiological Outcomes Workgroup (SEOW), Prevention Expert Partners Workgroup (PEPW), the Governor 's Prevention Advisory Council (GPAC), Problem Gambling Advisory Council, Mental Health and Substance Abuse Planning Council and Olmstead Commission. The Behavioral Health Division allocates approximately 25% of the SAPT BG primary prevention funding to support community - level prevention efforts on the four federally -recognized Native American reservations in the state. These Tribal Prevention Programs are required to follow the Strategic Prevention Framework as they provide culturally -appropriate substance abuse prevention coordination and implementation of evidence based programs, practices and strategies. These community programs implement the following strategies: information dissemination, education, alternatives, community -based processes and environmental efforts. This work is one of the strengths of the North Dakota Substance Abuse Prevention System - longstanding collaboration with the tribes in the state. The Division will also be taking over contracts for treatment/recovery services with the Native American reservations in the state, which were previously managed through the regional Human Service Centers. The Division is planning on furthering the development of partnerships between prevention and treatment efforts funded through the SAPT BG in order to align and Environmental Factors and Plan 8. Tribes - Requested Narrative Question The federal government has a unique obligation to help improve the health of American Indians and Alaska Natives through the various health and human services programs administered by HHS. Treaties, federal legislation, regulations, executive orders, and Presidential memoranda support and define the relationship of the federal government with federally recognized tribes, which is derived from the pol itical and legal relationship that Indian tribes have with the federal government and is not based upon race. SAMHSA is required by the 2009 Memorandum on Tribal Consultation59 to submit plans on how it will engage in regular and meaningful consultation and collaboration with tribal officials in the development of federal policies that have tribal implications. Improving the health and well -being of tribal nations is contingent upon understanding their specific needs. Tribal consultation is an essential tool in achieving that understanding. Consultation is an enhanced form of communication, which emphasizes trust, respect, and shared responsibility. It is an open and free exchange of information and opinion among parties, which leads to mutual understanding and comprehension. Consultation is integral to a deliberative process that results in effective collaboration and informed decision -making with the ultimate goal of reaching consensus on issues. In the context of the block grant funds awarded to tribes, SAMHSA views consultation as a government -to-government interaction and should be distinguished from input provided by individual tribal members or services provided for tribal members whether on or off t ribal lands. Therefore, the interaction should be attended by elected officials of the tribe or their designees and by the highest possibl e state officials. As states administer health and human services programs that are supported with federal funding, it is imperative that they cons ult with tribes to ensure the programs meet the needs of the tribes in the state. In addition to general stakeholder consultation, states should establish, implement, and document a process for consultation with the federally recognized tribal governments located within or governi ng tribal lands within their borders to solicit their input during the block grant planning process. Evidence that these actions have been performed by the state should be reflected throughout the state 's plan. Additionally, it is important to note that approximately 70 percent of American Indians and Alaska Natives do not live on tribal lands. The SMHAs, SSAs and tribes should collaborate to ensure access and culturally competent care for all American Indians and Alaska Natives in the states. States shall not require any tribe to waive its sovereign immunity in order to receive funds or for services to be provided f or tribal members on tribal lands. If a state does not have any federally recognized tribal governments or tribal lands within its borders, the state should mak e a declarative statement to that Page 1 of 2 Printed: 9/1/2017 11:34 AM - North Dakota - OMB Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 09/30/2020 Page 102 of 224leverage resources.

Primary Prevention - Required SABG Narrative Question SABG statute requires states to spend not less than 20 percent of their SABG allotment on primary prevention strategies direc ted at individuals not identified to be in need of treatment. While primary prevention set -aside funds must be used to fund strategies that have a positive impact on the prevention of substance use, it is important to note that many evidence -based substance use disorder prevention strategies also have a positive impact on other health and social outcomes such as education, juvenile justice involvement, violence prevention, and mental health. The SABG statute requires states to develop a comprehensive primary prevention program that includes activities and services provided in a variety of settings. The program must target both the general population and sub -groups that are at high risk for substance misuse. The program must include, but is not limited to, the following strategies: Information Dissemination providing awareness and knowledge of the nature, extent, and effects of alcohol, tobacco, and drug use, abuse, and addiction on individuals families and communities; Education aimed at affecting critical life and social skills, such as decision making, refusal skills, critical analysis, and systemati c judgment abilities; Alternative programs that provide for the participation of target populations in activities that exclude alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use; Problem Identification and referral that aims at identification of those who have indulged in illegal/age inappropriate use of tobacco or alcohol, and those individuals who have indulged in first use of illicit drugs, in order to assess if the behavior can be rev ersed by education to prevent further use; Community -based Process that include organizing, planning, and enhancing effectiveness of program, policy, and practice implementation, interagency collaboration, coalition building, and networking; and Environmental Strategies that establish or change written and unwritten community standards, codes, and attitudes, thereby influencing incidence and prevalence of the abuse of alcohol, tobacco and other drugs used in the general population. In implementing the comprehensive primary prevention program, states should use a variety of strategies that target populatio ns with different levels of risk, including the IOM classified universal, selective, and indicated strategies.

The state lacks sufficient affordable housing, especially for low and extremely low -income brackets. There is a severe shortage of homeless shelter options available in at least five of North Dakota 's eight regions. The availability of housing options that serve people with differing levels of need is also very limited - transitional units, low demand housing, and supported permanent housing are in very short supply. Housing subsidy funds are limited and waiting periods of 6 months to more than 1 year are common. Some zoning laws in the state contain provisions that make it difficult to construct group living facilities, which is the category most permanent supportive housing projects fall into. The specific regulatory language often involves definition of \"non-household \" living, rules regarding the number of unrelated individuals per unit, and the requirement for public hearings associated with conditional use permits process. Rental and cre dit history requirements create significant barriers for people to transition out of homelessness. Regions report that minimum cr edit scores of 600 are common for people to access housing. There continues to be barriers, particularly with HUD subsidized housi ng, for people with criminal histories and finding housing for individuals with a history of sexual offenses is particularly prob lematic. In addition, the employment opportunities are decreasing in the areas of the state impacted by the oil industry, due to the d ecline in activity, but the housing costs have not shown a similar decline. This has resulted in less potential for people who are h omeless to enter the job market while the lack of affordable housing has maintained. The ND Housing Finance Administration Director reports that there is a continued shortage of affordable housing. Even with some decrease in the oil industry activity, North Dakota 's estimated population on December 21, 2016 was 757,952. This estimate makes North Dakota the state with the highest percentage growth rate in the nation since the 2010 census. According to North Dakota 's Housing Finance Agency 's Executive Director, affordable housing continues to be a concern statewide in which homelessness is often a result. According to Reuters (2015), though the fall in oil prices has led to a decline in housing demand and rental costs, the demand for housing still outpaces the supply in western North Dakota. There are no homeless shelters in the two major western North Dakota communities and the slowdown in the oil industry has led to an increase in unemployment. The most recent Point -In-Time (PIT) Survey conducted in January 2016 found 923 people were experiencing homelessness on that night in North Dakota, including 769 adults and 154 children. Of these, 535 people were in emergency shelters, 172 were in transitional settings, and 216 (23%) were unsheltered. However, due to the limitations with the survey, it is believed this d ata underrepresents the true picture of homeless in North Dakota. Eight regionally -based coordinators funded under the Projects for Assistance in Transition from Homelessness (PATH) Grant provide persons who are homeless or at risk of homelessness and are mentally ill or have a co -occurring mental illness and substance use disorder with intensive case management services including therapy, skills training, supportive residential ser vices and coordinate obtaining other community mental health and addiction services from staff of the human service centers. Persons who are homeless and mentally ill are provided outreach services, screening for treatment services, housing services, and ref erral for health, education, and entitlements.Narratve Question Criterion 4: Targeted Services to Rural and Homeless Populations and to Older Adults Provides outreach to and services for individuals who experience homelessness; community -based services to individuals in rural areas; and community -based services to older adults.

In planning for allocation of the Mental Health Block Grant funding in North Dakota, the Behavioral Health Division took many considerations into account, including needs and gaps identified in the Behavioral Health Assessment: Gaps and Recommendations report and recommendations provided by the Behavioral Health Planning Council. Below are ten recommendations provided by the Behavioral Health Planning Council: 1. Fund a comprehensive approach to behavioral health with an implementation of the full continuum of care model. 2. Fund and implement the Medicaid 1915 (i) amendment to the state plan in the 2017 -19 biennium budget. a. Fund peer support services statewide with a goal to ensure that any individual receiving case management has access to peer support services. b. Increase availability of long term employment supports for qualified individuals. c. Expand crisis intervention services including mobile crisis units state -wide, peer supports within crisis intervention services, additional residential crisis beds, and less reliance on hospitals to perform those services. d. Funding permanent supportive housing services for pre and post tenancy. 3. Fund Medicaid expansion and urge the legislature to reaffirm the expansion prior to sunset on July 2017. 4. Department of Human Services shall create opportunities to strengthen advocacy voices to assist in making system change as identified in the Behavioral Health Planning Report by Schulte Consulting July 22, 2014. 5. Follow EPSDT Medicaid mandates, filling existing service gaps for required services 6. Continued funding of the Housing Incentive Fund with a priority to support development of permanent supported housing. 7. Support the establishment of behavioral health courts with associated necessary public behavioral health provisions implemented, including services for veterans see. 8. Ensure Human service centers provide services in a manner so all individuals who are eligible for services are able to receiv e an unconditional care model of services (zero reject). 9. Ensure Evidence -Based or promising practices are provided with high fidelity quality assurances. 10. State agencies must be provided with state training to increase military cultural competency (how to communicate with veterans or those who have served). This training should also be made available to any providers of behavioral health service s including private providers. ND Cares Network would be a good resource for the possible training materials. Following these recommendations and other needs and gaps in the system, the North Dakota Behavioral Health Division plans to allocate the Mental Health Block Grant funds in the following way: Partnerships Program (through the regional Human Service Centers): Mental Health Block Grant funding will support five Partnerships Programs located at the human service centers serving children with serious emotional disturbances. Peer Support: North Dakota is continuing to develop mental health peer support services throughout the state. First Episode Psychosis Treatment Program: The Division will continue work Prairie St. John 's in Fargo to implement a Coordinated Specialty Care pilot program to provide evidence -based First Episode Psychosis (FEP) treatment services to individuals between 15 and 25 years of age. Consumer Family Network: The Division, through the Mental Health Block Grant, provides support for the Consumer Family Network, a consumer -run advocacy program. Mental Health Criminal Justice Reform: The Division intends to work with system stakeholders to decrease the criminalization of mental illness including development of diversion strategies within North Dakota. Aging and Mental Health: Through the Mental Health Block Grant, the Division plans to assist with training for long term care staff regarding mental illness and best practices in working with older adults experiencing mental illness. Workforce Training: In order to increase the utilization of best practices, the Division plans to utilize some of the Mental Health Block Grant to support the training of clinicians and other mental health stakeholders. One way of doing this is through the annual Behavioral Health Conference hosted by the Behavioral Health Division. Planning Council: The Division plans to utilize some of the Mental Health Block Grant to support the functioning of the state 's Behavioral Health Planning Council, including administrative support services and travel reimbursement for the federally requ ired North Dakota Behavioral Health Planning Council.Narratve Question Criterion 5: Management Systems States describe their financial resources, staffing, and training for mental health services providers necessary for the plan ; provides for training of providers of emergency health services regarding SMI and SED; and how the state intends to expend this grant for the fiscal y ears involved.

The regional human service centers screen all admissions for preference as required in 45 C.F.R. 96.131 at initial contact. A ll regional human service centers and the Behavioral Health Division (BHD) have toll -free phone numbers. If the client identified as being a pregnant woman or injection drug user they are scheduled or offered appointments within 48 hours. An Assurance of Compliance with Rules and Regulations was signed by all regional human service center directors and included with substance abuse contracts in 2015 and 2017. The assurances stipulate the priority population requirements and the communication requirement with the BHD regarding their ability to admit pregnant woman. All regional human service centers are to provide preference for admission to treatment to pregnant women (who seek and are referred for and would benefit from Block Grant -funded treatment services). In the event a program would not be able to admit a client, the client is placed on a priority waiting list and interim services would be provided. Interim services may include pre -treatment groups, education, and case management. As identified in the assurance, North Dakota has a capacity management plan for pregnant women. Human Service Centers, upon reaching 90% of its capacity to admit pregnant women, shall provide written notification of that fact to Division within 7 da ys. If Human Service Center does not have the capacity to admit or refer a pregnant woman to the clinically appropriate modality of care within 48 hours of requesting treatment, Human Service Center shall: a. Place the client 's name and case number on an active waiting list, b. Recommend and provide interim services for the individual as required within 48 hours of the request for treatment, c. Provide Division with written notification immediately of the client 's case number, the date treatment was requested and the status of offered interim services, and d. Provide written notification to Division regarding the outcome of the individual 's admission status. If a client refuses treatment, the client 's name need not be placed on the waiting list. Pursuant to 45 CFR 96.126, a client who is initially receptive to treatment, but who later cannot be located for admission into treatment or refuses treatment when noti fied of an available treatment slot, may have that client 's name removed from the waiting list.

States are required to monitor program compliance related to tuberculosis services made available to individuals receiving SU D treatment. Please provide a detailed description of the specific strategies used by the state to identify compliance issues a nd corrective actions required to address identified problems. The regional human service centers screen all admissions for preference as required in 45 C.F.R. 96.131 at initial contact. A ll regional human service centers and the Behavioral Health Division (BHD) have toll -free phone numbers. If the client identified as being a pregnant woman or injection drug user they are scheduled or offered appointments within 48 hours. An Assurance of Compliance with Rules and Regulations was signed by all regional human service center directors and included with substance abuse contracts in 2015 and 2017. The assurances stipulate the priority population requirements and the communication requirement with the BHD regarding their ability to admit pregnant woman. All regional human service centers are to provide preference for admission to treatment to pregnant women (who seek and are referred for and would benefit from Block Grant -funded treatment services). In the event a program would not be able to admit a client, the client is placed on a priority waiting list and interim services would be provided. Interim services may include pre -treatment groups, education, and case management. As identified in the assurance, North Dakota has a capacity management plan for pregnant women. Human Service Centers, upon reaching 90% of its capacity to admit pregnant women, shall provide written notification of that fact to Division within 7 da ys. If Human Service Center does not have the capacity to admit or refer a pregnant woman to the clinically appropriate modality of care within 48 hours of requesting treatment, Human Service Center shall: a. Place the client 's name and case number on an active waiting list, b. Recommend and provide interim services for the individual as required within 48 hours of the request for treatment, Printed: 9/1/2017 11:33 AM - North Dakota Page 6 of 13 Printed: 9/1/2017 11:34 AM - North Dakota - OMB Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 09/30/2020 Page 129 of 224c. Provide Division with written notification immediately of the client 's case number, the date treatment was requested and the status of offered interim services, and d. Provide written notification to Division regarding the outcome of the individual 's admission status. If a client refuses treatment, the client 's name need not be placed on the waiting list. Pursuant to 45 CFR 96.126, a client who is initially receptive to treatment, but who later cannot be located for admission into treatment or refuses treatment when noti fied of an available treatment slot, may have that client 's name removed from the waiting list. Regional human service centers publicize priority status is provided to pregnant woman. This is found within their brochure and on the department 's web page at the following link: http://www.nd.gov/dhs/services/mentalhealth/index.html To ensure that pregnant women are admitted to treatment within 48 hours, the division can communicate and maintains contact with each regional human service centers. Case files of those clients who are identified in our management information system can be pulled and reviewed electronically as to whether the appropriate services were provided in the time frames specified w ithin the block grant. To ensure that interim services are provided to pregnant women in the event a human service center is has insufficient capaci ty to provide treatment services, a plan is in place. The eight regional human service centers are required and responsible to comp ly with all requirements of the SAPT Block Grant including capacity management and waiting list systems. The BHD worked with regional human service centers to create a signed Assurance of Compliance with Rules and Regulations outlining all activities required for receipt of SAPT Block Grant funds. Items included in this assurance include: Capacity management -Intravenous Drug Users (IVDU 's); Capacity management -Pregnant women; and Interim services requirements for pregnant women and IVDU 's A Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant Monitoring Checklist has been distributed. The Division maintains a to ll -free number ((800) 755 -2719). Providers are also instructed to call 1 -800-755-2719 or e -mail immediately if they are unable to admit and/or provide interim services for intravenous drug users and pregnant women. Interim services are intended to reduce the adverse health effects of alcohol and other drug abuse, promote the health of the individual, and reduce the risk of transmission of disease. For pregnant women, interim services shall include counseling on the effects of alcohol and drug use on the fetus, as well as referral for prenatal care. At a minimum, interim services for other populations shall include education on HIV and TB and risks of transmission, case management, referrals for testing to public health or primary physician, and alcohol/drug screening. When interim services are provided, the client will be seen at least weekly by a case management staff member who will provid e education on a 1:1 basis. During this time, referrals to public health for testing and/or prenatal care and alcohol/drug screening can be managed. In the event interim services cannot be provided, BHD will be notified of the client 's name and case number and arrangements will be made for provision of services by another agency but to date, this has not been used. The BHD is responsible for monitoring compliance and a plan has been developed to conduct block grant compliance reviews biennially with each of the regional human service centers and compliance with these issues assessed. The plan also includes reports to be submitted to the BHD either immediately, within 7 days, monthly or quarterly.

Quality Improvement Plan - Requested Narrative Question In previous block grant applications, SAMHSA asked states to base their administrative operations and service delivery on pri nciples of Continuous Quality Improvement/Total Quality Management (CQI/TQM). These CQI processes should identify and track critical outcomes and performance measures, based on valid and reliable data, consistent with the NBHQF, which will describe the health and functio ning of the mental health and addiction systems. The CQI processes should continuously measure the effectiveness of services and supports and ensure that they continue to reflect this evidence of effectiveness. The state 's CQI process should also track programmatic improvements using stakeholder input, including the general population and individuals in treatment and recovery and their families. In addition, the CQI plan should include a description of the process for responding to emergencies, critical incidents, complaints, and grievances.

Environmental Factors and Plan 13. Trauma - Requested Narrative Question Trauma 60 is a widespread, harmful, and costly public health problem. It occurs because of violence, abuse, neglect, loss, disaster, wa r and other emotionally harmful and/or life threatening experiences. Trauma has no boundaries with regard to age, gender, socioeconomic s tatus, race, ethnicity, geography, or sexual orientation. It is an almost universal experience of people with mental and substance use dif ficulties. The need to address trauma is increasingly viewed as an important component of effective behavioral health service delivery. Additionally , it has become evident that addressing trauma requires a multi -pronged, multi -agency public health approach inclusive of public education and awareness, prevention and early identification, and effective trauma -specific assessment and treatment. To maximize the impact of these efforts, they need to be provided in an organizational or community context that is trauma -informed. Individuals with experiences of trauma are found in multiple service sectors, not just in behavioral health. People in the ju venile and criminal justice system have high rates of mental illness and substance use disorders and personal histories of trauma. Children and f amilies in the child welfare system similarly experience high rates of trauma and associated behavioral health problems. Many patients in primary, specialty, emergency and rehabilitative health care similarly have significant trauma histories, which has an impact on their health and their responsiveness to health interventions. Schools are now recognizing that the impact of exposure to trauma and violence among their students makes it difficult to learn and meet academic goals. Communities and neighborhoods experience trauma and violence. For some t hese are rare events and for others these are daily events that children and families are forced to live with. These children and families remain especially vulnerable to trauma -related problems, often are in resource poor areas, and rarely seek or receive behavioral health care. States should work with these communities to identify interventions that best meet the needs of these residents. In addition, the public institutions and service systems that are intended to provide services and supports for individuals are often re -traumatizing, making it necessary to rethink doing \"business as usual.\" These public institutions and service settings are increasingly ado pting a trauma - informed approach. A trauma -informed approach is distinct from trauma -specific assessments and treatments. Rather, trauma -informed refers to creating an organizational culture or climate that realizes the widespread impact of trauma, recognizes the signs and symp toms of trauma in clients and staff, responds by integrating knowledge about trauma into policies and procedures, and seeks to actively resist re-traumatizing clients and staff. This approach is guided by key principles that promote safety, trustworthiness and transparency, peer supp ort, empowerment, collaboration, and sensitivity to cultural and gender issues. A trauma -informed approach may incorporate trauma -specific screening, assessment, treatment, and recovery practices or refer individuals to these appropriate services. It is suggested that states refer to SAMHSA's guidance for implementing the trauma -informed approach discussed in the Concept of Trauma61 paper. 60 Definition of Trauma: Individual trauma results from an event, series of events, or set of circumstances that is experienced by an individual as ph ysically or emotionally harmful or life threatening and that has lasting adverse effects on the individual's functioning and mental, physical, social , emotional, or spiritual well -being. 61 Ibid Footnotes: Printed: 9/1/2017 11:33 AM - North Dakota Page 1 of 1 Printed: 9/1/2017 11:34 AM - North Dakota - OMB Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 09/30/2020 Page 138 of 224Please respond to the following items 1.

Does the state provide cross -trainings for behavioral health providers and criminal/juvenile justice personnel to increase capacity for working with individuals with behavioral health issues involved in the justice system? nmlkji Yes nmlkj No 4. Does the state have an inter -agency coordinating committee or advisory board that addresses criminal and juvenile justice issues and that includes the SMHA, SSA, and other governmental and non -governmental entities to address behavioral health and other essential domains such as employment, education, and finances? nmlkji Yes nmlkj No 5. Does the state have any activities related to this section that you would like to highlight? In the 2017 North Dakota Legislative Session, Senate Bill 2015 established a $7.5M investment in behavioral health services f or people in the criminal justice system to improve public safety and public health outcomes. A primary goal of this effort is to improve healthcare outcomes and reduce recidivism by delivering high -quality community behavioral health services linked with effective community supervision. The Departments of Correction and Rehabilitation and Human Services are partnering with loca l agencies and governments to deliver coordinated and comprehensive services to people in the program. Using a certified paraprofessional workforce and an integrated, multidisciplinary approach, community -based agencies will provide a range of services including comprehensive case planning, linking participants to services, peer recovery supports, and facilitating communication. The Department of Human Services has proposed four initial implementation sites for the community behavioral health program (Dickinson, Fargo, Devils Lake, and Bismarck areas). Another goal of this effort is to cultivate a network of community behavioral health providers to help meet treatment needs o f people in the criminal justice system. In particular, Care Coordination and Peer Support Specialists are two core support positions needing to be strengthened. The Behavioral Health Division is currently under contract with the University of North Dakota Ce nter Environmental Factors and Plan 14. Criminal and Juvenile Justice - Requested Narrative Question More than half of all prison and jail inmates meet criteria for having mental health problems, six in ten meet criteria for a substance use problem, and more than one -third meet criteria for having co -occurring mental and substance use problems. Youth in the juvenile justice system often display a variety of high -risk characteristics that include inadequate family support, school failure, negative peer associations, and insufficient use of community -based services. Most adjudicated youth released from secure detention do not have community follow -up or supervision; therefore, risk factors remain unaddressed.62 Successful diversion of adults and youth from incarceration or re -entering the community from detention is often dependent on engaging in appropriate M/SUD treatment. Some states have implemented such efforts as mental health, veteran and drug courts, Crisis Inte rvention Training (CIT) and re -entry programs to help reduce arrests, imprisonment and recidivism.63 A diversion program places youth in an alternative program, rather than processing them in the juvenile justice system. State s should place an emphasis on screening, assessment, and services provided prior to adjudication and/or sentencing to divert persons with M/SUD from correctional settings. States should also examine specific barriers such as a lack of identification needed for enrollment Me dicaid and/or Marketplace; loss of eligibility for Medicaid resulting from incarceration; and care coordination for individuals with chroni c health conditions, housing instability, and employment challenges. Secure custody rates decline when community agencies are present to advocate for alternatives to detention. The MHBG and SABG may be especially valuable in supporting care coordination to promote pre -adjudication or pre -sentencing diversion, providing care during gaps in enrollment after incarceration, and supporting other efforts related to enrollment. 62 Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency: Identifying High -Risk Youth: Prevalence and Patterns of Adolescent Drug Victims, Judges, and Juvenile Court Reform Through Restorative Justice.

On August 10, 2016, Community Medical Services began serving patients at the first OTP in Minot, North Dakota. As of May 1, 2017, they were serving 70 patients. Client demographics show an age range from 19 to 62. The state 's second OTP opened in Bismarck, North Dakota, on March 8, 2017, and as of May 1, 2017, they were serving 20 patients. On April 18, 2017, North Dakota 's third OTP opened in Fargo, North Dakota, and is currently serving 17 patients. Please indicate areas of technical assistance needed to this section. *Appropriate use is defined as use of medication for the treatment of a substance use disorder, combining psychological treat ments with approved medications, use of peer supports in the recovery process, safeguards against misuse and/or diversion of controlled substance s used in treatment of substance use disorders, and advocacy with state payers. Environmental Factors and Plan 15. Medication Assisted Treatment - Requested Narrative Question There is a voluminous literature on the efficacy of medication -assisted treatment (MAT); the use of FDA approved medication; counseling; behavioral therapy; and social support services, in the treatment of substance use disorders. However, many treatment program s in the U.S. offer only abstinence -based treatment for these conditions. The evidence base for MAT for SUDs is described in SAMHSA TIPs 40[1], 43[2], 45[3], and 49[4]. SAMHSA strongly encourages that the states require treatment facilities providing clinical care to those with substance use d isorders demonstrate that they both have the capacity and staff expertise to use MAT or have collaborative relationships with other pr oviders that can provide the appropriate MAT services clinically needed. Individuals with substance use disorders who have a disorder for which there is an FDA approved medication treatment should h ave access to those treatments based upon each individual patient's needs. In addition, SAMHSA also encourages states to require the use of MAT for substance use disorders for opioid use, alcohol use, and tobacco use disorders where clinically appropriate. SAMHSA is asking for input from states to inform SAMHSA's activities.

Crisis Services - Requested Narrative Question In the on -going development of efforts to build an robust system of evidence -based care for persons diagnosed with SMI, SED and SUD and their families via a coordinated continuum of treatments, services and supports, growing attention is being paid across the c ountry to how states and local communities identify and effectively respond to, prevent, manage and help individuals, families, and communi ties recover from behavioral health crises. SAMHSA has recently released a publication, Crisis Services Effectiveness, Cost Effectiveness and Funding Strategies that states may find helpful.64 SAMHSA has taken a leadership role in deepening the understanding of what it means to be in crisis and how to respond to a crisis experienced by people with behavioral health conditions and their families. According to SAMHSA's publication, Practice Guidelines: Core Elements for Responding to Mental Health Crises65, \"Adults, children, and older adults with an SMI or emotional disorder often lead lives characterized by recurrent, significan t crises. These crises are not the inevitable consequences of mental disability, but rather represent the combined impact of a host of additional fa ctors, including lack of access to essential services and supports, poverty, unstable housing, coexisting substance use, other health problems, dis crimination, and victimization.\" A crisis response system will have the capacity to prevent, recognize, respond, de -escalate, and follow -up from crises across a continuum, from crisis planning, to early stages of support and respite, to crisis stabilization and intervention, to post -crisis follow -up and support for the individual and their family. SAMHSA expects that states will build on the emerging and growing body of evidence for effective community - based crisis -prevention and response systems. Given the multi -system involvement of many individuals with behavioral health issues, the crisis system approach provides the infrastructure to improve care coordination and outcomes, manage costs, and better invest resour ces.

Recovery - Required Narrative Question The implementation of recovery supports and services are imperative for providing comprehensive, quality behavioral health ca re. The expansion in access to and coverage for health care compels SAMHSA to promote the availability, quality, and financing of vit al services and support systems that facilitate recovery for individuals.Recovery encompasses the spectrum of individual needs related to tho se with mental disorders and/or substance use disorders. Recovery is supported through the key components of: health (access to quality heal th and behavioral health treatment); home (housing with needed supports), purpose (education, employment, and other pursuits); and community (p eer, family, and other social supports). The principles of recovery guide the approach to person -centered care that is inclusive of shared decision -making. The continuum of care for these conditions includes psychiatric and psychosocial interventions to address acute episodes or r ecurrence of symptoms associated with an individual?s mental or substance use disorder. Because mental and substance use disorders are chr onic conditions, systems and services are necessary to facilitate the initiation, stabilization, and management of long -term recovery. SAMHSA has developed the following working definition of recovery from mental and/or substance use disorders: Recovery is a process of change through which individuals improve their health and wellness, live a self -directed life, and strive to reach their full potential. In addition, SAMHSA identified 10 guiding principles of recovery: Recovery emerges from hope; Recovery is person -driven; Recovery occurs via many pathways; Recovery is holistic; Recovery is supported by peers and allies; Recovery is supported through relationship and social networks; Recovery is culturally -based and influenced; Recovery is supported by addressing trauma; Recovery involves individuals, families, community strengths, and responsibility; Recovery is based on respect. Please see SAMHSA's Working Definition of Recovery from Mental Disorders and Substance Use Disorders . States are strongly encouraged to consider ways to incorporate recovery support services, including peer -delivered services, into their continuum of care. Examples of evidence -based and emerging practices in peer recovery support services include, but are not limited to, the following: SAMHSA strongly encourages states to take proactive steps to implement recovery support services. To accomplish this goal and support the wide -scale adoption of recovery supports in the areas of health, home, purpose, and community, SAMHSA has launched Bringing Recove ry Printed: 9/1/2017 11:33 AM - North Dakota Page 1 of 2 Printed: 9/1/2017 11:34 AM - North Dakota - OMB Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 09/30/2020 Page 144 of 224Please respond to the following: 1.

Supports to Scale Technical Assistance Center Strategy (BRSS TACS). BRSS TACS assists states and others to promote adoption o f recovery - oriented supports, services, and systems for people in recovery from substance use and/or mental disorders. Because recovery is based on the involvement of consumers/peers/people in recovery, their family members and caregivers, SMHA s and SSAs can engage these individuals, families, and caregivers in developing recovery -oriented systems and services. States should also support existing and create resources for new consumer, family, and youth networks; recovery community organizations and peer -run organizations; and advocacy organizations to ensure a recovery orientation and expand support networks and recovery services. States are strongl y encouraged to engage individuals and families in developing, implementing and monitoring the state M/SUD treatment system.

Does the state have any activities related to this section that you would like to highlight? Please indicate areas of technical assistance needed related to this section. Environmental Factors and Plan 18. Community Living and the Implementation of Olmstead - Requested Narrative Question The integration mandate in Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Supreme Court's decision in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999) , provide legal requirements that are consistent with SAMHSA's mission to reduce the impact of M/SUD on America's communities . Being an active member of a community is an important part of recovery for persons with behavioral health conditions. Title II of the ADA and the regulations promulgated for its enforcement require that states provide services in the most integrated setting appropria te to the individual and prohibit needless institutionalization and segregation in work, living, and other settings. In response to the 10th anniversary of the Supreme Court's Olmstead decision, the Coordinating Council on Community Living was created at HHS. SAMHSA has been a key member of the council and has funded a number of technical assistance opportunities to promote integrated services for people with behavior al health needs, including a policy academy to share effective practices with states. Community living has been a priority across the federal government with recent changes to section 811 and other housing progr ams operated by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). HUD and HHS collaborate to support housing opportunities for person s with disabilities, including persons with behavioral illnesses. The Department of Justice (DOJ) and the HHS Office for Civil Right s (OCR) cooperate on enforcement and compliance measures. DOJ and OCR have expressed concern about some aspects of state mental health systems inc luding use of traditional institutions and other settings that have institutional characteristics to serve persons whose needs could be better met in community settings. More recently, there has been litigation regarding certain evidenced -based supported employment services such as sheltered workshops. States should ensure block grant funds are allocated to support prevention, treatment, and recovery serv ices in community settings whenever feasible and remain committed, as SAMHSA is, to ensuring services are implemented in accordance with Olmste ad and Title II of the ADA.

Children and Adolescents Behavioral Health Services - Required MHBG, Requested SABG Narrative Question MHBG funds are intended to support programs and activities for children and adolescents with SED, and SABG funds are availabl e for prevention, treatment, and recovery services for youth and young adults with substance use disorders. Each year, an estimated 20 percent of children in the U.S. have a diagnosable mental health condition and one in 10 suffers from a serious emotional disturbance th at contributes to substantial impairment in their functioning at home, at school, or in the community66. Most mental disorders have their roots in childhood, with about 50 percent of affected adults manifesting such disorders by age 14, and 75 percent by age 2467. For youth between the ages of 10 and 24, suicide is the third leading cause of death and for children between 12 and 17, the second leading cause of death68. It is also important to note that 11 percent of high school students have a diagnosable substance use disorder involving nico tine, alcohol, or illicit drugs, and nine out of 10 adults who meet clinical criteria for a substance use disorder started smoking, drinking, o r using illicit drugs before the age of 18. Of people who started using before the age of 18, one in four will develop an addiction compared to one in twenty -five who started using substances after age 2169. Mental and substance use disorders in children and adolescents are complex, typically involving multiple challenges. These children and youth are frequently involved in more than one specialized system, including mental h ealth, substance abuse, primary health, education, childcare, child welfare, or juvenile justice. This multi -system involvement often results in fragmented and inadequate care, leaving families overwhelmed and children's needs unmet. For youth and young adults who are transitioning into adult responsibilities, negotiating between the child - and adult -serving systems becomes even harder. To address the need for additional coordination, SAMHSA is encouraging states to designate a point person for children to assist schools in assuring identified children are connected with available mental health and/or substance abuse screening, treatment and recovery support services. Since 1993, SAMHSA has funded the Children's Mental Health Initiative (CMHI) to build the system of care approach in states a nd communities around the country. This has been an ongoing program with 173 grants awarded to states and communities, and every state has received at least one CMHI grant. Since then SAMHSA has awarded planning and implementation grants to states for adolescent and transition age youth SUD treatment and infrastructure development. This work has included a focus on financing, workforce development and implementing evidence - based treatments. For the past 25 years, the system of care approach has been the major framework for improving delivery systems, services, and outcomes for children, youth, and young adults with mental and/or SUD and co -occurring M/SUD and their families. This approach is comprised of a spectrum of effective, community -based services and supports that are organized into a coordinated network. This approach helps build meaningful partnerships across systems and addresses cultural and linguistic needs while improving the child, youth and young adult functioning in home, school, and community. The system of care approach provides individualized services, is family driven; youth guided and culturally competent; and builds on the strengths of the child, youth or young adult and their family to promote recovery and resilience. Services are delivered in the least restrictive environment possible, use evidence -based practices, and create effective cross -system collaboration including integrated management of service delivery and costs70. According to data from the 2015 Report to Congress71 on systems of care, services: 1. reach many children and youth typically underserved by the mental health system; 2. improve emotional and behavioral outcomes for children and youth; 3. enhance family outcomes, such as decreased caregiver stress; 4. decrease suicidal ideation and gestures; 5. expand the availability of effective supports and services; and 6. save money by reducing costs in high cost services such as residential settings, inpatient hospitals, and juvenile justice settings. SAMHSA expects that states will build on the well -documented, effective system of care approach to serving children and youth with serious behavioral health needs. Given the multi - system involvement of these children and youth, the system of care approach provides the infrastructure to improve care coordination and outcomes, manage costs, and better invest resources. The array of services and supports in the system of care approach includes: non-residential services (e.g., wraparound service planning, intensive case management, outpatient therapy, intensive home -based services, SUD intensive outpatient services, continuing care, and mobile crisis response); supportive services, (e.g., peer youth support, family peer support, respite services, mental health consultation, and suppor ted education and employment); and Printed: 9/1/2017 11:33 AM - North Dakota Page 1 of 2 Printed: 9/1/2017 11:34 AM - North Dakota - OMB Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 09/30/2020 Page 147 of 224Please respond to the following items: 1.

Environmental Factors and Plan 20. Suicide Prevention - Required MHBG Narrative Question Suicide is a major public health concern, it is the 10th leading cause of death overall, with over 40,000 people dying by sui cide each year in the United States. The causes of suicide are complex and determined by multiple combinations of factors, such as mental illness, substance abuse, painful losses, exposure to violence, and social isolation. Mental illness and substance abuse are possible factors in 90 per cent of the deaths from suicide, and alcohol use is a factor in approximately one -third of all suicides. Therefore, SAMHSA urges behavioral health agencies to lead in ways that are suitable to this growing area of concern. SAMHSA is committed to supporting states and territories in providing services to individuals with SMI/SED who are at risk for suicide through the use of MHBG funds to address these risk factors and prevent suicide. SAMHSA encourages the behavioral health agencies play a leadership role on suicide prevention efforts, including shaping, implementi ng, monitoring, care, and recovery support services among individuals with SMI/SED.

Unless otherwise noted, the data and graphs in this document are based on occurrent data, which takes into consideration the number of suicides that occur in North Dakota regardless of resident stat us at the time of death. Occurrent data was used for a variety of reasons. First, individuals may not claim North Dakota residency because they are temporarily living in the state for school , work , relocation , among other reasons . Second, there is no set length of time required to be considered a re sident of North Dakota . In the past, resident -only data was used for charts and graphs. It is important to note that the occurrent data may not match resident -only data from previous years . When reporting rates, the number of suicides that occurred within a particular population or community is used as the numerator (unless otherwise noted ). The denominator used is based on the census populations. This was done for consistency between the res ident and occurrent trends, as well as using a verified census count rather than population estimates.

A total of 42,773 suicides were documented in 2014, which translates to an average of one person dying by suicide every 12.3 minutes. This is the highest rate of suicide in the last 15 years. In 2014, suicide was the tenth leading cause of death overall and the third leading cause of death for those ages 15 to 24. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate s that one million people attempt suicide annually and two million experience suicidal thoughts each year. These st atistics translate to one attempt every 34 seconds (American Association of Suicidology).

Suicide is the ninth leading cause of death in North Dakota overall , and the second leading cause of death f or those between the ages of 15 and 24 . While many more North Dakotans attempt suicide than die by suicide, North Dakota does not yet have a system to track how many North Dakotans receive medical treatment f or injuries resulting from suicide attempts. The American Association of Suicidology estimate s for every completed suicide , there are as many as 25 more people who at tempt suicide but do not die (2008). In 2015, 1,870 North Dakota residents called the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline requesting support for suicidal thoughts or actions (reported by North Dakota's crisis -line service provider, Firstlink Fargo).

According to the Harvard C.H. Chan School of Public Health, access to firearms is a risk factor for suicides. While firearm owners are not more suicidal than non -owners, their suicide attempts are more likely to be fatal. Many suicide attempts are made with little planning during a short -term crisis period. If highly lethal means are made less available to impulsive attempters , and they substitute less lethal means or temporarily postpone their attempt, survival odds increase .

People who attempt suicide and survive. 2. People who have lost a loved one to suicide. The loss of a loved one by suicide is often traumatic , and perhaps one of the most difficult things a person will face in their lifetime. They may feel as if they cannot survive the death of their loved one. The individual may need support and community resources to assist with the grieving and healing process. In the U.S. , it is estimated that between 6 and 32 survivors exist for each suicide, depending on the definition used (Berman, A. L. Estimating the population of survivors of suicide: Seeking an evidence base. Suicide and Life -Threatening Behavior 2011 . 41(1), 110 -116). There are approximately 5 million survivors in the U.S. In North Dakota , using the most conservative estimate (Berman, A.L.,2011) , it is calculated that 702 North Dakotans became new suicide survivors in 2015, in addition to the thousands of survivors a lready living in the state. In North Dakota, we recognize that survivors bear a significant emotional weight over the loss of their loved one. There are several ways survivors can connect with each other, such as support groups, community walks or recognit ion of International Survivors of Suicide Loss Day. Some advice for survivors Feelings of shock, guilt, blame, anger, relief, depression and isolation are common. These feelings are often overwhelming , but normal . Seek people who are able and willing to listen; this may include friends and family, clergy or professionals. Survivors need to t ake care of themselves physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually. They should s eek professional help if needed. Being a suicide survivor is considered a risk factor for attempting suicide. According to the American Association of Suicidology, the increased risk of suicide in the survivor population is an area that needs further research.

According to CDC national vital records , about 5,000 young people between the ages of 10 and 24 die by suicide each year. Youth suicide rates in the U.S. have tripled since the 1950s. Nationally , suicide is the third leading cause of death for t hose between the ages of 15 and 24 . In North Dakot a, suicide is the second leading cause of death for this age group . The Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) is a biennial survey that monitors health risks and behaviors of youth in grade s 7 through 12 . Suicide -Related Behaviors (Grades 9 -12) Source: North Dakota Department of Public Instruction, YRBS 2011, 2013, 2015, and National 2015 data Young people consistently say that having caring adults in their lives such as teachers, coaches, ministers and other trusted adults, is a valuable resource during times of suicidal thoughts (Jason Foundation) . In addition to general population risk factors for suicide, speci fic risk factors occur in the adolescent and young adult population. These include: Worsening school p erformance Unhealthy peer relationships Participating in risky behaviors Bullying Fixation on violence and death Unrealistic academic pressures Unrealistic social or family expectations that m ay create a sense of rejection 24 15 12 1125 16141227 1614 930 18 15 9 05101520253035 Felt sad or hopeless (almost every day for 2 or more weeks)Considered Planned Attempted 2011 2013 2015 2015 NAT Printed: 9/1/2017 11:33 AM - North Dakota Page 14 of 36 Printed: 9/1/2017 11:34 AM - North Dakota - OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 09/30/2020 Page 162 of 224 NORTH DAKOTA SUICIDE PREVENTION PLAN 2017 -2020 | 7 Suicide in Middle Adulthood For many people, middle adulthood (ages 35 -64) is the prime of their lives. Those in middle adulthood can also face many stressful life events . This has contributed to a steadily increasing number of completed suicides in the U.S. and North Dakota over the past several years. In fact, they show the largest increases in any age group. In 2011 (most recent national data), middle -aged adults accounted for the most significan t proportion of suicides (56%), and from 1999 -2010, the suicide rate among this group increased by almost 30% (CDC Suicide Facts at a Glance, 2015). In recent years, N orth Dakota has experienced a significant increase in suicide among Caucasian men in middle adulthood. This increase roughly reflects the population changes that began with what has been called North Dakota's oil boom. However, it is also important to note that suicide rates peak for women in midlife. Risk factors for suicide in middle adulthood include: Loss of youthful dreams can result in the realization that the perfect ideal life will not be a reality. Depression is most common in midlife and a major factor in midlife suicides. Depression is more than just sadness and can be effectively treated. High -risk behaviors such as substance use, unsafe sexual behavior, reckless spending or self - injury often pose as escapes from depression or loneliness; howeve r, these behaviors frequently magnify the feelings that the person is trying to avoid . Decreased social support resulting from divorce, job loss or empty nest syndrome may contribute to loneliness, depression and substance use. With help, there is hope.

For some older adults , physical or emotional pain prevents them from finding fulfillment. If their pain is not addressed, they may attempt suicid e. Suicide and suicide attempts in the older adult population tend to occur more often in rural areas than urban. Older Caucasians are more likely to die by suicide than other races. Older adults are less likely to act o n suicidal thoughts impulsively; therefore , there may be more time to notice warning signs of suicide and intervene. Risk factors for suicide in the older adult population include: Loss of self -esteem can be a contributor to thoughts of suicide. Feelings of uselessness, hopelessness or an ger because of the aging process can lead to thoughts of suicide. Depression is more than just \"sadness.\" Depression is a major risk factor in suicide attempts and completed suicides in older adults. It is important to know there are effective treatments f or depression. Substance use is sometimes used to cope with feelings of depression or loneliness; however, substance use often magnifies the feeling that the person is trying to escape. Chronic illness can affect some older adults with severe and painful r esults. Physical pain, in addition to feelings of hopelessness and depression, can lead to suicidal thoughts or actions. Isolation from family and friends may make an older person more susceptible to loneliness, depression and substance use.

The term LGBTQ+ also encompasses identities which transcend traditional binary views of romantic attraction (e.g., asexual, polyamorous, pansexual, etc.) and gender (e.g., gender - queer, bigender, agender, etc.), and identities represented by the queer plus (i.e., Q+) portion of the acronym (Bornstein, 1998; Wilchins, 2002) . LGBTQ+ individuals account for an estimated four percent of the U .S. population and two percent of North Dakota's population ( Gates, 2011) . Despite medical and psychological research demonstrating the normalcy of these identities and expression (American Psychological Association et al., 2015; Swaab & Garcia -Falgueras, 2009) , the LGBTQ+ community experiences higher rates of discrimination than the general public. Rates of Suicide in the LGBTQ+ Population The LGBTQ+ population experience s higher rates of suicide than most other populations. Existing empirical literature indicates that LGB TQ+ youth are 3.4 times more likely to attempt suicide than their non -LGBTQ+ peers. Transgender individuals are ten times more likely to attempt suicide than the general population (Clements -Nolle, Marx, & Katz, 2006; Grossman & D'augelli, 2006; Haas, Rodgers, & Herman, 2014) . Homeless LGBTQ+ youth make up 40 percent of the homeless population . Sixty -two percent of members of LGBTQ+ adults report attempting suicide , while 29 percent of their straight peers report attempting suicide (Haas et al., 2010) . The 2013 National School Climate Survey issued by the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN) found that most LGBT Q+ high school students had been verbally or electronically harassed because of sexual identity or gender expression. Students who were harassed were more likely to skip school, drop out, and experience low self - esteem and depression.

Nearly 8 out of 10 students have experienced harassment at school in the past year ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ), http://www.cdc.gov/lgbthealth/youth.htm ). Sixty percent reported they felt unsafe while at school. Coming Out or disclosing oneself as homosexual can be a critical and dangerous time. Research indicates that the first year after disclosure of sexual ori entation to one's parents is a prime period for suicide attempts. Teens who are rejected by their families are at more than eight times the risk for a suicide attempt (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, http://www.cdc.gov/lgbthealth/youth.htm ). Lack of familial support has been established to be a significant factor in poor mental health, poor physical health, lower socio -economic status, poor academic performance, criminality and the current rate of LGBTQ+ youth homelessness (40% of the homeless population (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, 2016) . Increased Risk for Mental Illness. Due to lack of acceptance, LGBTQ+ individuals experience higher rates of mental illness and suicide than any other population (Goldstein, 2013) , and are three times more likely to experience mental illness than the general popula tion (National Alliance on Mental Illness, 2016) . Greater Likelihood of Victimization. A larger proportion of LGBTQ+ individuals report physical assault (25 -55%), sexual harassment (84%), parental abuse (34 -46%), and bullying (49%) by both peers and teachers than the general pop ulation (Kosciw, Greytak, Palmer, & B oesen, 2014) . Lack of Access to Affirming Healthcare. Current data indicate that existing healthcare providers are woefully unprepared to treat LGBTQ+ people (Shipherd, Green, & Abramovitz, 2010) . As such, this population is less likely to seek mental health care services out of fear of being mistreated or emotionally abused by mental health professionals (Blumer, Green, Knowles, & Williams, 2012) . Substance Use and Abuse. The LGBTQ+ population has higher rates of usage and abuse of controlled and elicit substances including alcohol (twice as likely), marijuana (three times as likely) and cocai ne (eight times as likely) ( Ward et al., 2014) . HIV/AIDS Status. The LGBTQ+ population has a disproportionally high rate of HIV/AIDS. As a result, nearly half of transgender individuals who are HIV -positive are likely to make a suicide attempt (Haas et al., 2014) . However, the rate of LGBTQ+ persons who are HIV - positi ve and make a suicide attempt is decreasing due to increased access to antiretroviral treatments (Haas et al., 2011) .

The reasons why suicide rates are high among the AI/AN population are complex, but some include the prevalence of serious mental health diso rders which are related to suicide , such as anxiety, substance use and depression. The graph below depicts the occurrence of the total suicide rate in North Dakota (per 100,000) compared to the American Indian suicide rate in North Dakota. American Indian and All Other Populations in North Dakota From 1980 -2015 North Dakota Department of Health, Vital Records The American Indian suicide rate appears to fluctuate dramatically because the number of American Indian North Dakota residents is sm all compared to other populations.

Proximity and relationship to suicide may put individuals at greater risk of suicide. American Indians may be at higher risk of suicide because AI/AN have much exposure to suicide. Discrimination is as important a predictor of suicide ideation as poor self-esteem or depression. Mental he alth services are difficult to access for many American Indians in North Dakota. Barriers to care include a lack of quality service providers and funding on reservations, personal transportation and payment barriers , as well as stigma. Stressful environ ments result from few economic resources or social supports for many American Indian families on and off reservations in North Dakota. Trauma from adverse or violent experiences increases suicide risk. American Indians are at higher risk of physical assa ult. Historical Trauma is the trauma resulting from past efforts to eliminate American Indian cultures throughout the United States with such means as the sending of children to boarding schools and prohibiting their language and cultural activities. The fallout from reported boarding school child abuse and oth er historical traumas contribute to suicide risk today. Family breakdown may result from historical trauma, economic struggles, discrimination , or family histories of substance use disorders. Alienation or feeling emotionally disconnected from his or h er family of origin or culture may cause a loss of well-being or lead to depression. Alcohol and drug use is an ongoing risk factor. In 2005 -2006, 37.1 percent of AI/AN in the U.S. who died from suicide and had tested positive for alcohol were legally into xicated ( Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Review. June 19, 2009; 58(23):637 -4). Acculturation is the changing of a culture as it mixes with other cultures. In some national studies, AI/AN with greater acculturation reported increased psychosocial stress, less happiness and increased use of drugs to cope with stress.

In 2014, 7,400 veterans died by suicide, making up 18 percent of all suicides in America that year , while Veterans only make up nine percent of the U.S. population. Acco rding to new data revealed by the Department of Veterans Affairs, roughly 20 veterans die by suicide every day nationwide. Veteran suicides increased 50 percent from 2001 to 2008 (The War Within: Preventing S uicide in the U .S. military, Rand Cooperation. 2011) . Military veterans are twice as likely to die from suicide as people who have never served in the military. Research about suicide by members of the armed forces indicated that risk factors include: male, depression, subs tance abuse and relationship issues (James LC, Kowalski TJ) (Mil Med 1996; 161:97 -101). More than of 90 percent of Army suicides involve substance abuse, primarily alcohol. A study of suicide mortality of veterans being treated for depression in the Vetera ns Affairs Health System reported that \"unlike the general population, older and younger veterans are more prone to suicide than are middle -aged veterans \" (Zivin K, Kim HM, McCarthy JF, Austin KIL, Hoggatt KJ, Walters H, Valenstein M. ; American Journal of Public Health. 2007; 97:12) . In North Dakota , suicide rates for those who have served in the military at some point in their lives are consistently around 15 to 20 percent of the total yearly suicide deaths . The national average is 20 percent.

The National Institute on Drug Abuse states that teens who engage in high -risk behaviors such as using drugs, alcohol and tobacco, repor t significantly higher rates of depression, suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts. Additionally, binge drinking among teens has been identified as a predictive factor for suicidal thoughts. A study concerning alcohol and suicide found that in the suicide deaths studied, 33.3 percent tested positive for alcohol. Of those, more than 56 percent had blood alcohol content over .08, which is legally intoxicated (Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, 2009). The rise in drug abuse over the past 30 years and the more recent epidemic of opioid use is believed to be a contributing factor in the increase in youth suicides, specifically among adolescent males. According to the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) that was conducted in 2013 in North Dakota , six percent of students in middle school and 21 percent of students in high school reported that they had consumed five or more drinks of alcohol in a row, that is, within a couple of hours, in one or more of the past 30 days, which constitutes binge drinking. Suicide and Mental Health People with a mental illness may have a heightened risk of suicidal thoughts. When c oupled with substance use, the risk increases . While 95 percent of individuals with a mental illness and/or substance use disorder will never complete suicide, several decades worth of data from numerous studies found evidence suggest ing that as many as 90 percent of individu als who complete suicide experience a mental or substance use disorder, or both (Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, 2008). Viol ence, Trauma, Adverse Childhood Experiences and Suicide Research shows that there is a relationship between violence and suicide among victims of domestic and sexual abuse, as well as other forms of violence. Like suicide, domestic violence is often stigmatized and hidden; the exact link between domestic violence and suicide is not known. Richard McKeon, Ph.D., chief of the suicide prevention branch at the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) , states that survivors of intimate partner violence are twice as likely to attempt suicide multiple times. Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs), negative and traumatic childhood experiences such as child abuse have been linked to mental illness, substance use disorder and many other suicide risk factors and disorders in adulthood. It is, therefore, no surprise that ACEs are also linked to Printed: 9/1/2017 11:33 AM - North Dakota Page 22 of 36 Printed: 9/1/2017 11:34 AM - North Dakota - OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 09/30/2020 Page 170 of 224 NORTH DAKOTA SUICIDE PREVENTION PLAN 2017 -2020 | 15 suicide attempts. One study published by the Journal of Preventive Medicine (Felitti, VJ. e t al. May 1998 . Volume 14, Issue 4, Pages 245-258) found that persons who had experienced four or more ACE s had a 4- to 12 -fold increase in health risks for alcoholism, drug abuse, depression and suicide attempt s. The study concluded that there is a strong , graded relationship between exposure to abuse during childhood and multiple risk factors including suicide . Underlying Principles of the North Dakota Suicide Prevention Plan Suicide is Largely Preventable Suicide is preventable and always has contributing factors . No single event causes suicide to occur. The majority of people who die by suicide show signs of suicidality long before they attempt suicide . Early identification of warning signs , effective intervention and treatment drastically reduces the risk of someone dying by suicide. Learning about suicide and suicide prevention will assist North Dakotans in recognizing the warning signs . Perhaps this knowledge could help someone preve nt the loss of a loved one or friend who is in crisis. Everyone Can Help Prevent Suicide Just as suicide affects everyone , all North Dakotans can help prevent suicides . Suicide prevention requires vision, will and a commitment from the state, communities and individuals within North Dakota. While treatment must be provided by a qualified professional , everyone can learn to recognize suicide warning signs. People who are in contact with those at risk of suicide are often the first line of defense for suicid e prevention. These \"gatekeepers\" can be family members, social acquaintances or those in more formal relationships, such as physicians, teachers and hairdressers. It is important for people to feel empowered to intervene when they perceive someone to be a t risk for suicide. Professionals can play an influentia l role in suicide prevention and education. Partners in behavioral health, education and other disciplines help identify clients or students at risk of suicide and offer effective intervention servi ces. Professionals can also provide suicide prevention training to their communities to spread the word that suicide is preventable. The Stigmas Associated With Suicide Should Be Eliminated Social stigma continues to challenge suicide prevention efforts. Stigma and shame often plague those experiencing suicidal thoughts as well as those who have survived a suicide attempt or loss. Suicide risk factors like substance use, mental illness and depression also carry a social stigma.

As many as one in six people will think about suicide at some point in their lives. Please know that there is help available The most important thing you can do is talk to someone y ou trust. If there is no one you feel you can talk to, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1.800.273.8255 or 1.800.273.TALK . Please remember : Suicidal thinking is usually associated with problems that can be treated. Several tries at treatment are sometimes necessary before the right combination is found. If you are unable to think of solutions other than suicid e, it is not that solutions don' t exist, only that they are not apparent to yo u. Therapists and friends can often help you see possible solutions. Suicidal crises are almost always temporary. Although it might seem as if your unhappiness will never end, i t is important to realize that crises are usuall y time -limited. Don' t let suicide rob you of better times that will come your w ay. Problems are seldom as great as they appear at first glance. Stressful events can seem catastrophic at the time they are happening. Months or years later , they usually look smaller and more manageable. Reasons for living can help sustain a person in pain. You might be able to strengthen your connection with life when you remember what has gotten you through hard times in the past. (Information adapted from the American Association of Suicidology. ) Please, reach out to someone. Don' t keep suicidal thoughts to yourself.

How was the Council involved in the development and review of the state plan and report? Attach supporting documentation (e.g . meeting minutes, letters of support, etc...) a) What mechanism does the state use to plan and implement substance misuse prevention, SUD treatment and recovery services? Under the mandate outlined in Public Law 102 -321 (42 U.S.C 300X -4), thirty member board -- the North Dakota Mental Health and Substance Abuse Planning Council -- was created with members appointed by the Governor of North Dakota. The Council 's objective is to monitor, review, and evaluate the allocation and adequacy of mental health services in the state. Each board member is appointed to a three -year term and not less than 50% of the board is composed of individuals other than state employees and providers of mental health services. The Council meets quarterly to discuss community -based public behavioral health services and works closely to plan for the system of care and monitor its implementation. The agenda of each meeting involves review and discussion of the priority areas found in the block grant and discussion of the system of care. The Council 's input is woven into the block grant plan. The Council developed recommendations which drove the decisions regarding the Mental Health Block Grant budget allocations. The Council also has provided recommendations to both the Department of Human Services and the Governor's Office. b) Has the Council successfully integrated substance misuse prevention and treatment or co - occurring disorder issues, concerns, and activities into i nmlkj Yes nmlkj No 2.

Please indicate the duties and responsibilities of the Council, including how it gathers meaningful input from people in reco very, families, and other important stakeholders, and how it has advocated for individuals with SMI or SED. As identified in the North Dakota Behavioral Health Council By -Laws, the following duties of the council are established: Review and evaluate services and programs provided by the State of North Dakota and make periodic reports to the Department of Human Services and the Governor 's office, including any recommendations for improvements in services, programs, or facilities. Review the status of combined behavioral health assessments and plan, staff resources, expenditure of funds and available case management information at least semi -annually. Review the combined behavioral health assessment and plan at least annually. Work with legislators in members ' respective regions to familiarize lawmakers with the need for appropriate mental health and substance abuse issues. Recommend the initiation of surveys of regional human service needs and review the results of such surveys for the purpose of recommending to the Department of Human Services ways in which identified needs can be met by the Department of Human Services.Environmental Factors and Plan 22. State Behavioral Health Planning/Advisory Council and Input on the Mental Health/Substance Abuse Block Grant Application - Required MHBG Narrative Question Each state is required to establish and maintain a state Mental Health Planning/Advisory Council for adults with SMI or child ren with SED. To meet the needs of states that are integrating services supported by MHBG and SABG, SAMHSA is recommending that states expand their Mental Health Advisory Council to include substance misuse prevention, SUD treatment, and recovery representation, referred to here as a Behavioral Health Advisory/Planning Council (BHPC). SAMHSA encourages states to expand their required Council's comprehensive approach b y designing and implementing regularly scheduled collaborations with an existing substance misuse prevention, SUD treatment, an d recovery advisory council to ensure that the council reviews issues and services for persons with, or at risk, for substance misuse an d SUDs. To assist with implementing a BHPC, SAMHSA has created Best Practices for State Behavioral Health Planning Councils: The Road to Planning Council Integration.72 Planning Councils are required by statute to review state plans and implementation reports; and submit any recommended modifi cations to the state. Planning councils monitor, review, and evaluate, not less than once each year, the allocation and adequacy of mental h ealth services within the state. They also serve as an advocate for individuals with behavioral health problems. SAMHSA requests that any re commendations for modifications to the application or comments to the implementation report that were received from the Planning Council be submitted to SAMHSA, regardless of whether the state has accepted the recommendations. The documentation, preferably a letter signed by th e Chair of the Planning Council, should state that the Planning Council reviewed the application and implementation report and should be tra nsmitted as attachments by the state. 72http://beta.samhsa.gov/grants/block -grants/resources Printed: 9/1/2017 11:33 AM - North Dakota Page 1 of 4 Printed: 9/1/2017 11:34 AM - North Dakota - OMB Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 09/30/2020 Page 187 of 224Serve as the State forum for meetings with governing boards of other public and private human service agencies that are broug ht to the council by the Department of Human Services for the purpose of promoting greater understanding, efficiency and effectiveness in the working relationships among local and regional service providers.

We can prevent and reduce chronic disease and promote wellness by treating behavioral health needs on an equal footing with other health conditions. APPROACH To ensure a comprehensive approach, a variety of sources were utilized in the development of this assessment, including stakeholder feedback and existing reports. Also, this Behavioral Health Assessment takes into consideration some important factors that have not been previously reviewed, including: Epidemiological data identi fying the prevalence of behavioral health needs among children and adults in the state is included. Basing decisions on epidemiological data ensures that efforts are selected appropriately and implemented effectively. Sample of Data Sources reviewed: Youth Risk Behavior Survey; Behavioral Risk Surveillance System; National Survey on Drug Use and Health The proposed vision for the North Dakota Behavioral Health System is grounded on the Institute of Medicine's Continuum of Care model, this assessment provide d a review of the full Continuum of Care (from promotion and prevention through recovery). In order to see sustained effective behavioral health system changes we need to have a strong, developed infrastructure . Therefore, the discussion and initial reco mmendations are based on this global systems and infrastructure perspective . CONSIDERATIONS In the review of the full Continuum of Care, funding and reimbursement , infrastructure (including agency -level, workforce, oversight) and best practice were con siderations. Below is a summary of gaps and needs identified within the Continuum of Care model. Continuum of Care Gaps/Needs Promotion/ Prevention Limited resources for mental health promotion and mental illness prevention efforts The field of mental health promotion and mental illness prevention is fairly new. Workforce and best practices are still being identified No credentialing for prevention professionals Overall, promotion and prevention tends to not be valued as a priority Printed: 9/1/2017 11:34 AM Page 3 of 30 Printed: 9/1/2017 11:34 AM - North Dakota - OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 09/30/2020 Page 197 of 224 Page | 4 Continuum of Care Gaps/Needs Intervention Gaps in collaboration/integration with the education system, including early childhood and childcare systems. Workforce limitations (credentials needed to conduct screenings and assessments, utilization of evidence -based practices) A consistent, universal screening is not utilized Funding can be limited for screenings When screenings are occurring, often there are issues with an efficient referral process to further assessment and/or treatment services In general, the current proc ess of conducting assessments is not efficient or effective Treatment Criminalization of behavioral health disorders - There is no payment for services for individuals in jail - Limited community -based services (including housing, transportation, employment) available to allow individuals choice of services in the least restrictive environment Current services are not integrated with each other or other community organizations; this includes the utilization and exchange of data. Changes in level of care are o ften not fluid. Communication/promotion of services available is limited. Workforce limitations - Limitations in utilization of evidence -based practices - No single registry of mental health providers Role clarification needed between public and private servic e systems Recovery Workforce limitations (number of trained providers in evidence -based recovery services) Limited evidence -based services, and the infrastructure to support these services, available in the state, including sober living environments and other community -based services and supports (including housing, transportation, employment) Limited payment to support evidence -based recovery services ND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM RECOMMENDATIO NS It is the hope that this assessment lays the foundation to support an effective, efficient and sustainable behavioral health system in North Dakota. This is not the end, but the beginning.

The recommendations identified through this assessment are not \"magic bullets\" and are not the lone answers to filling the gaps in the state's behavioral health system. True, sustainable change takes time and investment needs to be made in the foundation. When these recommendations are implemented, the foundation will be laid where additional work can be done to ensure the individuals, families and communities in North D akota have access to quality behavioral health services and that this work is able to be sustained. The North Dakota Department of Human Services, Behavioral Health Division wa s tasked with reporting the outcome of this assessment by the 64th Legislativ e Interim Human Services Committee at the August 2015 committee meeting .1 The mission of the Department of Human Services is to provide quality, efficient and effective human services, which improve the lives of people. The Behavioral Health Division prov ides leadership for the planning, development and oversight of the state's behavioral health system. The Behavioral Health Division does not provide direct services , rather the role of the Division is to ensure health and safety and access to a wide -range of quality behavioral health services across the state . 1 www.legis.nd.gov/assembly/64 -2015/committees/interim/human -services -committee 30 Printed: 9/1/2017 11:34 AM - North Dakota - OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 09/30/2020 Page 199 of 224 Page | 6 Introduction and Approach In recent years, the state's behavioral health system has received much attention and review , with stakeholders from multiple disciplines coming together initiat ing dialogue that would lead to effective change. Numerous suggestions, recommendations and priorities have previously been identified. This important work was considered through the development of this Behavioral Health Assessment . However, t his Behavioral H ealth Assessment takes into consideration some important factors that have not been previously reviewed: - Epidemiological data identifying the prevalence of behavioral health needs among children and adults in the state. - A review of the full Continuum of Ca re (from promotion and prevention through recovery) . - Global systems infrastructure perspective. This assessment identifies global recommendations , which when implemented , will set the foundation to support further enhancements to the state's behavioral health system in a comprehensiv e, efficient and effective way. This assessment is one piece of the puzzle on the road to a comprehensive and effective behavioral health system . The goal of this document is to identify , as a foundation , where stakehold ers can align to develop and support a comprehensive behavioral health system . The following provides some additional background on how this assessment was approached: - It is acknowledged there are regional and community -level differences in need and availa ble services across the state . However, i n order to provide a comprehensive look at the state's behavioral health system and infrastructure , this assessment takes a statewide and global perspective. Communities are encouraged to take the information from t his assessment and overlay with any local -specific information to ensure efforts are relevant . - It is important to identify the structure and readiness of the current system when assessing and making recommendations . Matching strategies to a community /syste m's level of readiness is absolutely essential for success. Efforts that are too ambitious are likely to fail because community members or stakeholders will not be ready or able to respond. - The current structure of the behavioral health sys tem in the state is not fully integrated . Most often, substance use disorder and mental health services are delivered in separate systems , or at best co -located . It is recognized that true integration is a key objective in order to be most effective. Because of this lac k of integration, this assessment is broken up into the following topic areas: children's behavioral health; a dult mental health; and adult substance use. Also, efforts are continuing to further integrate behavioral health and primary care. - It is acknowled ged that multiple efforts are occurring , each impact ing the state's behavioral health system . These efforts include the recentl y finalized brain injury needs assessment, the substance exposed n ewbor ns task force recommendations, seclusion and restraint task force recommendations, problem gambling needs assessment, justice reinvestment efforts, opioid addiction efforts and other local/regional work . It is important to note th is assessment does not include any specific information or recommendations from these efforts. Inste ad, it is encouraged to use the recommendations of this assessment as the foundation for moving these efforts forward.

There are good examples of efforts to integrate and deliver services effective ly in areas throughout the state. It will be important to garner these successes and co nsider the abi lity to scale these efforts statewide. In addition to the review of previously developed reports focused on the state's behavioral health system, t his assessment sought perspectives from service providers, key stakeholders, and consumers an d families in both the state's public and private behavioral health systems.

Behavioral health is a state of mental/emotional being and/or choices and actions that affect wellness. Behavioral health conditions affect people from all walks of life and all age groups. These illnesses are common, recurrent, and often serious, but they are treatable and people recover.2 Such conditions are far -reaching and exact an enormous toll on individuals, their families and communities, and the broader society. Behavioral health is an essential part of health service systems and effective community -wide strategies. Behavioral health and physical health are also connected. Good behavioral health often contributes to good physical health. Likewise, the presence of behavioral health disor ders is frequently associated with physical health disorders. Vision for an Effective Behavioral Health System Behavioral health is an essential part of overall health in which prevention works, treatment is effective and people recov er. The North Dakota behavioral health s ystem is built to support people - at both the individual and community levels. The proposed vision for the North Dakota Behavioral Health System is grounded on the Institute of Medicine's Continuum of Care model . The goal of this model is to ensure there is access to a full range of high quality services to meet the various needs of North Dakotans. The services available throughout this continuum should reflect current knowledge and technology and be grounded in evidence -based practice . Throughout all levels of the continuum, there should be a continuous promotion of healthy behaviors and lifestyles , a primary driver of health outcomes. In summary, the goal of the state's behavioral health system is to ensure there is access to quality services across the continuum of care supporting the behavioral health of North Dakotans across the lifespan. See Appendix B for some excerpts from the \" Description of a Good and Modern Addictions and Mental Health Service System \", which describes some key components of an effective behavioral health system in more detail . 2 SAMHSA Institute of Medicine Continuum of Care Printed: 11:34 AM Page 8 of 30 Printed: 9/1/2017 11:34 AM - North Dakota - OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 09/30/2020 Page 202 of 224 Page | 9 Behavioral Health Data Review Basing decisions on epidemiological data ensures that efforts are selected appropriately and implemented effectively. By understanding the true scope of the problem, decision -makers are able to identify priority areas and reach the populations of greatest need . The North Dakota Department of Human Services' Behavioral Health Division initiated the State Epidemiological Outcomes Workgroup ( SEOW ) in 2006 , though funding received from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) . Initially created with the purpose of bringing data on substance abuse to the forefront of the prevention planning process, the SEOW broadened its scope in 2014 to include broader behavioral health issues. The mission of the North Dakota SEOW is to identify, analyze and communicate key substance abuse and related behavioral health data to guide programs, policies and practices. The SEOW has built a broad representation of diverse partners and continues to provide leadership in identifying data needs. For more informa tion on the SEOW and data products, visit: www.prevention.nd.gov/data . This section presents a set of behavioral health indicators as found through existing statewide and national datasets, much of which through the state's SEOW. This array of indicators provides an overview of the state's behavioral health at a point in time. The data presented in this assessment is a sampling and does not intend to be exhaustive. The purpose of this brief review is to id entify some key data available to guide decision -making, and simultaneously identify gaps in available data . It will be important to continue this data collection, analysis and review, with specific considerations for health disparities. This information is vital in the state's efforts to reduce the impact of behavioral health conditions on North Dakota individuals, families and communities.

These conditions are among the top conditions that cause disability and carry a high burden of disease in the United States, resulting in significant costs to families, employers, and publicly funded health systems. By 2020, ment al and substance use disorders will surpass all physical diseases as a major cause of disability worldwide.3 According to SAMHSA's 2013 -2014 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) an estimated 91,912 (16.1%) North Dakotans ages 18 and up experienc ed some form of mental illness. In the past year, 51,950 adults (9.1%) had a substance use disorder. Of these, 18,839 people had both a mental disorder and substance use disorder, also known as co-occurring mental and substance use disorders . Persons with mental illness and/or substance use disorders die, on average, about 5 years earlier than persons without these conditions .4 And, persons with serious mental illness (SMI) are now dying 25 years earlier than the general population.5 In addition, behavioral health conditions can lead to other chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease. Individuals with a mental illness may develop cancer at a 2.6 times higher rate on account of late stage diagnosis and inadequate treatment and screenings.6 Addressing the impact of substance use alone is estimated to cost Americans more than $600 billion each year.7 F-M Ambulance Service (FMA) is the largest ambulance operator in North Dakota respondi ng to more than 26,000 calls for service annually . Of those calls, one -third are behavioral health related . Common calls include substance abuse, depression, suicidal ideation, anxiety and depression. Too often psychological maladies are often accompanied by chronic physical illnesses.8 Children's Behavioral Health MENTAL HEALTH Over one in four (27.2%) ND high school students report feeling sad or hopeless almost every day for 2 or more weeks in a row so that they stopped doing some usual activities during the past year . This percentage was highest among high school females (35.2% compared to 19.6% males). At North Dakota Human Service Centers (statewide) , an average of 1,556 youth are receiving mental health services in a quarter (3 month period ; average of four quarters; April 2015 - March 2016 ). 3 SAMHSA: http://www.samhsa.gov/prevention 4 Druss BG, et al.

Fifty-five percent of the needs for these children were developmental, which includes autism, ADHD and prenatal drug exposure. Thirty -nine percent of needs were behavioral needs (screaming, biting, kicking, etc.).9 Good mental health often contributes to good physi cal health. Likewise, the presence of menta l and/or substance use disorder is frequently associated with physical health disorders. 17.2% of ND high school students have a long -term health problem.10 Suicide : Sixteen percent of ND high school students seriously considered attempting suicide at some point during the past year and 13.5% of made a plan about how they would attempt suicide. Again, these rates were higher among females than males (20.4% compared to 12.2% and 16.1% compared to 10.9% respectively). Almost one in ten (9.4%) ND high school students attempted suicide one or more times during the past year .11 9 Child Care Providers Caring for Children with Special Needs; Child Care Aware\u00ae of North Dakota Data; July -December 2015 10 North Dakota Youth Risk Behavior Survey, 2015 https://www.nd.gov/dpi/SchoolStaff/SafeHealthy/YRBS/ 11 North Dakota Youth Risk Behavior 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015ND High School Students reported feeling sad or hopeless (almost every day for 2 or more weeks in a row so that they stopped doing some usual activities during the last 12 months) YRBS Printed: 9/1/2017 11:34 AM Page 11 of 30 Printed: 9/1/2017 11:34 AM - North Dakota - OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 09/30/2020 Page 205 of 224 Page | 12 51.3% of ND adults are concerned about whether their community has sufficient alcohol and other drug abuse prevention programs 2015 ND Community Readiness Survey Gambling: Almost one third ( 29.4% ) of ND high school students have gambled on a sports team, gambled when playi ng cards or a dice game, played one of their state's lottery games, gambled on the Internet, or bet on a game of personal skill such as pool or a video game at least once in the past year .12 Nationally, approximately 4 -5% of youth, ages 12 -17, meet one or more criteria of having a gambling problem. Another 10 -14% are at risk of developing an addiction, which means that they already show signs of losing control over their gambling behavior.13 Substance Use and Abuse: Even with great declines in the past decade, a lcohol and tobacco are still the most currently used subs tances among youth in the state. The percentage of North Dakota high school students who reported having one or more drinks of alcohol during the pa st 30 days, decreased from 60.5% in 1999, to 30.8% in 2015.

In 2015, the Human Service Centers identified approximately 2,200 adults with serious mental illness as receiving services, which comes to 9.7% of the population needing services. At times, it is appropriate and effective for inpatient treatment for individuals with mental illness. Conservative estimates suggest a need for 50 -60 adult beds per 100,000 population. Based on this estimate, North Dakota total need would be an approxim ate 350 -420 beds. The total beds currently available is rig ht around 323 .

When components of the system are missing, individuals with behaviora l health needs are either under -treated or over -treated, which limits positive outcomes for the individual, family and larger co mmunity. I t is vital that an individual's behavioral health need is identified early, assessed accurately, and the best -possibl e, least -restrictive services (directly matching the need) are available and provided. Simplistically, an individual with a behavioral health need should receive the right services at the right time in the right dose. Another vital component of ensurin g a full continuum of care is partnership and collaboration. Movement throughout the continuum should be seamless and fluid. Because an individual's behavioral health needs cannot be disconnected , services and stakeholders should not be disconnected . Supportive, healthy communities are neede d to support overall health. T his includes involvement and collaboration among a variety of sectors: primary care, education, criminal justice, behavioral health services (public & private) , medical services, social services, etc. When reviewing services and systems in place across the continuum of care, there are a few additional considerations that were taken into account in this assessment . In order to create sustainable and effective change, it is not sufficient to merely identify that a particular service is or is not available. It is vital to look deeper into why services are not available and if they are available, whether they are effective. - Funding or reimbursement : If there is not funding or resources to support a service, or there is no reimbursement for the service, the service will likely not exist. - Infrastructure , including agencies/organizations, workforce, and oversight bodies: In order for a service to be available and sustainable, there are sever al layers of infrastructure that are needed. There needs to be an agency or organization through which the service is provide d, a workforce to provide the service, and an oversight body to ensure quality, health and safety. - Best practices: Best practices exist and should be utilized in the provision of all behavioral health services across the state. Services must continuous evaluate effectiveness. Promotion/Prevention The field of prevention science, well known for advancing the health of people at risk for illnesses such as cancer, diabetes, and heart disease, has also produced effective strategies for the behavioral health fields. Prevention is a cost -effective and common -sense way to avoid the consequences o f behavioral health disorders. Prevention efforts are effective when approaches are comprehensive, address risk and protective factors, and focus on a community's unique challenges. All promotion and prevention eff orts should recognize and Printed: 9/1/2017 11:34 AM Page 19 of 30 Printed: 9/1/2017 11:34 AM - North Dakota - OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 09/30/2020 Page 213 of 224 Page | 20 Almost half (48.9%) of ND adults agree that there are leaders in their community who are interested in reducing access and abuse of alcohol and other drugs 2015 ND Community Readiness Survey address the interrelated impact of behavioral health on overall well -being. Investing one dollar in prevention can yield ten dollars of savings in health costs, criminal and juvenile justice costs, educational costs and lost produ ctivity.42 Stakeholder Feedback In general stakeholders valued the importance of promotion and prevention. However, often stakeholders were not aware of prevention efforts occurring in the state or what evidence -based promotion and prevention services sho uld look like. Stakeholders see situations everyday where individuals end up needing more advanced care than would have been necessary if prevention and early intervention services were available. Currently in the state , substance abuse prevention servic es are primarily funded through federal grants and have guidelines that direct what funds can be spent on. Mental health promotion and mental illness prevention is a fairly new field of which b est practices are still being identified . Identified Gaps and Needs - Workforce and best practices are still being identified , as mental health promotion and mental illness prevention are new to the state . - Limited resources supporting mental health promotion and mental illness prevention efforts . - There is no credentialing process in the state for prevention professionals . - Overall, promotion and prevention tends to not be valued as a priority . Early Interventio n A systematic approach within systems for the early identification of behavioral health disorders is critical. Research suggests that investing in early intervention services can contribute to a reduction in health care costs and help ensure the improved health and well -being of individuals . When integrated into primary health care systems, school settings, and community -based programs, screening can lead to early interventions that can prevent problems from arising. Stakeholder Feedback Stakeholders identify the importance of early intervention services and at the same time identify some pretty significant gaps in the early intervention services available in the state for children and adults across all behavioral health needs (mental illness and substance abuse). Because of this gap, individuals who develop a behavioral health condition often end up needing more intensive and expensive services because th e early intervention services in the continuum of care are not available. And, if the services are available they are not consistent across populations and locations. Stakeholders identified that a lack funding/ reimbursement and workforce may limit the a vailability of early intervention services. Also, stakeholders identified the need for coordination and coll aboration between systems ( primary care, education, long - 42 Institute of Medicine and National Research Council's Preventing Mental, Emotional, and Behavioral Disorders Among Young People report - 2009 Printed: 9/1/2017 11:34 AM Page 20 of 30 Printed: 9/1/2017 11:34 AM - North Dakota - OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 09/30/2020 Page 214 of 224 Page | 21 term care, early childhood d evelopment, law enforcement, criminal justice, public and priv ate providers and other systems). Identified Gaps and Needs - In general, gaps in collaboration and integration with the education system, including early childhood and c hildcare systems exist. - There is a need to identify the primary workforce (including credentials) responsible for implementing evidence -based screening efforts. - There is not a consistent, universal screening utilized in the state. - At this time, it was identified that funding is a limitation in the widespread implementation of screening s and early intervention programs . - Where screenings are occurring in the state , often there are issues with an efficien t referral process to further assessment and/or treatment services . - In general, the current process of conducting assessments is not efficient or effective and this often delays the provision of services. Treatment Treatment is the use of any planned, intentional intervention in the health, behavioral and person al or family life of an individual suffering from a behavioral heal th disorder designed to enable the affected individual to achieve and maintain physical, mental health and a maximum functional ability. Individual paths to recovery differ, and packages of treatments and supportive services for mental and substance use di sorders should be tailored to fit individual needs. Stakeholder Feedback The primary focus of the previous ly completed behavioral health assessments have been the behavioral health treatment system and services. Multiple needs and recommendations have been identified through these processes. As discussions about treatment services occurred in meetings with stakeholders , multiple facets of the system were identified. From the initial assessment process identifying an individual's true behavioral health need to the identification and availability of appropriate services and supports. Assessment and treatment services are not necessarily consistent across the state or across systems (mental health or substance abuse). For example, services provided for in dividuals with a substance use disorder usually are therapy or treatment. However, individuals with a serious mental illness typically receive medication and case management services. Stakeholders identify a lack of individualized treatment and a lack of integrated care services available for consumers. Other concerns noted were a lack of a centralized \"bed count\" system to ensure efficient access to open beds and transportation to inpatient facilities. Stakeholders also expressed a lack of transportat ion for individuals needing treatment services, at times, causing crisis beds to be utilized for housing when transportation is not available. Another piece identified throughout most stakeholder meetings was limited services throughout the state . The service limitations reported differed by region whether workforce issues, Printed: 9/1/2017 11:34 AM Page 21 of 30 Printed: 9/1/2017 11:34 AM - North Dakota - OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 09/30/2020 Page 215 of 224 Page | 22 timeliness to access services or the availability of effective services. Stakeholders were generally not awar e of the priority populations or proposed changes in the public se rvice delivery system. Lastly, because all substance use disorder programs are required to be licensed, there is the ability to identify the levels of services available in various areas of the state to identify gaps. Stakeholders expressed a lack of a vailable information regarding mental health providers. Identified Gaps and Needs - There is a need to reduce the c riminalization of behavioral health disorders . Also, reimbursement is not available for BH ser vices for individuals in jails. - As the field is moving to understand the chronic nature of behavioral health conditions, it has been identified that there are many limitations in the availability of community -based services (including housing, transportation, employment) to allow individuals choice of services in the least restrictive environment and to support individuals throughout their life. - In general, behavioral health services in the state are not integrated in service provision. Also, limited collaboration or communication with community or health organizations , including the utilization and exchange of data . Also related to this integration, it was identified that when individuals change to a different level of care in service provision, the transition is often not fluid or seamless. - Oftentimes the services available in a community are not widely known. Changes in services or processes are not always communicated widely to stakeholders and the general public. - As has been identified in previous studies and assessments, there are gaps an d needs in the behavioral health workforce. However, this limitation is not exclusively related to the number of providers. There are other considerations in this need, including the limitations in utilization of evidence -based practices among the curren t workforce. Also, there is a need for a single registry for mental health providers. - Comprehensive c are coordination is lacking across the system for individuals wit h a behavioral health condition. This includes a need for workforce capacity building about effective care coordination. - There is a continued need for r ole clarification between the public and private behavioral health service systems to ensure the variety of treatment services are available to individuals. Recovery Recovery is the process of change through which individuals improve their health and wellness, live a self -directed life, and strive to reach their full potential. The process of recovery is highly personal and occurs via many pathways. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) has delineated four major dimensions that support a life in recovery: (1) Health \u2014overcoming or managing one's disease(s) or symptoms \u2014for example, abstaining from use of alcohol, illici t drugs, and non -prescribed medications if one has an addiction problem \u2014and, for everyone in recovery, making informed, healthy choices that support physical and emotional well -being; (2) Home \u2014having a stable and safe place to live; (3) Purpose \u2014 conducting meaningful daily activities, such as a job, school volunteerism, family caretaking, or Printed: 9/1/2017 11:34 AM Page 22 of 30 Printed: 9/1/2017 11:34 AM - North Dakota - OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 09/30/2020 Page 216 of 224 Page | 23 creative endeavors, and the independence, income, and resources to participate in society; and (4) Community \u2014having relationships and social networks that provide suppor t, friendship, love, and hope. Stakeholder Feedback Stakeholders identified limited recovery supports, including community -based services , peer support, supported employment and supported housing . Funding/reimbursement was identified as a barrier as well as a sustainable workforce and infrastructure . Identified Gaps and Needs - Workforce limitations (number of trained providers in evidence -based recovery services) - Limited ev idence -based services, and the infrastructure to support these servi ces, available in the state, includi ng sober living environments and o ther community -based services and supports (including housing, transportation, employment) - Limited payment to support evidence -based recovery services Printed: 9/1/2017 11:34 AM Page 23 of 30 Printed: 9/1/2017 11:34 AM - North Dakota - OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 09/30/2020 Page 217 of 224 Page | 24 Summary and Recommendations It is acknowledged that the foundational recommendations in this assessment require the involvement and collaboration of a variety of stakeholders. No one system can address these issues . Also, m any stakeholder groups have identified service needs, communication barriers and data gaps. It is important to continue engaging stake holder groups in order to identify more specific recommendations once infrastructure concerns have been addressed. The following recommendations have been identified as vital foundational pieces on which further efforts can contin ue to be made and be sustained: - Continuous collection, analysis and utilization of comprehensive behavioral health data . - Development of a formal Children's Behavioral Health Leadership group . - Supp ort substance use disorder early intervention services . - Mental health promotion and early identification of mental illness . - Continue to support public service delivery system changes relating to core services and population . - Recognition of behavioral healt h conditions as a chronic disease . Through the process of identifying these recommendations, some special considerations and populations came to light, which need further attention. Federal funding availability often directs the behavioral health servi ces available and are an important resource in considering avenues to fill gaps in the state's behavioral health system. However, resources need to be considered in the application for federal funding and the management of these federal funds. Also, as mentioned in various ways throughout this assessment, the silos present at various levels (funding, services, providers, etc.) greatly impact the effectiveness of the behavioral health Printed: 9/1/2017 11:34 AM Page 24 of 30 Printed: 9/1/2017 11:34 AM - North Dakota - OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 09/30/2020 Page 218 of 224 Page | 25 system as a whole. True inte gration must be a key consideration througho ut all behavioral health system efforts. To be effective, all behavioral health services must be person -centered, where services are centered on the needs and desires of the individual. It i s important to note throughout the system review there was recogn ition the need for consideration of special populations. The following special populations have been identified as needing further identification of needs: early childhood, transition -age youth , 18-25 year olds not in higher education , tribal memb ers, military service members and family, older North Dakotans, persons with disabilities and individuals in jail. Continuous Collection, Analysis and Utilization of Comprehensive Behavioral Health Data Behavioral health epidemiological data and service data should be collected, monitored and communicated regularly to guide system and program decisions. In order for this to happen , authority and resources would need to be established . Individual agencies and programs typically track and monitor their own dat a. However, currently the data is not compiled to provide a picture of the broader behavioral health system. Overall, it is recommended that a priority be placed on the utilization of comprehensive data to guide further work in the behaviora l health fie ld. Specifically, i t is recommended that a uthority and resources be identified to require and/or incentivize data submission by programs, support the ongoing collection and analysis of the data, and communicate the data/results to stakeholders, decision -makers, and the general public. Development of a Formal Children's Behavioral Health Leadership Group Many systems and agencies play a role in the children's behavioral health system across the continuum of care . Partnership and collaboration across these systems is vital to ensure a seamless and effective system of care for children where services are streamlined and not duplicated . Stakeholders report there is currently no primary, coordinated infrastructure, authority or leadership to guide the work of children's behavioral health across system s. It is recommended that a formal, sustainable leadership group is established to assess and guide efforts within the children's behavioral health system. It is recommended t his group bring s together the key st akeholders, including those from the following fields (among others) : education, social services, behavioral health, criminal justice, medical, advocacy, etc. As arose through stakeholder discussions, it is recommended t he primary items this leadership gro up should address are screening, early intervention services, assessment processes, transitions and coordination between services, with the ultimate goal of supporting the full continuum for children. Support Substance Use Disorder Early Intervention Servi ces The early intervention services section of the continuum of care is one area that has pretty significant gaps and because of this impacts all areas of the system. It is recommended to review resources in order to ensure the evidence -based program, Screening, Brief Intervention Printed: 9/1/2017 11:34 AM Page 25 of 30 Printed: 9/1/2017 11:34 AM - North Dakota - OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 09/30/2020 Page 219 of 224 Page | 26 and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) , is provided in a consistent manner across the state. The first step should in clude ensuring reimbursement options for this service. Another area where early intervention services for substa nce use disorders can be enhanced in the state is by expanding the required alcohol and drug education for all first offenders of alcohol -related offenses. An important consideration in this is ensuring an oversight body is established. Finally, another ar ea where early intervention services can be enhanced (and simultaneously fulfills a part of the first recommendation for continuous data collection and analysis) is to analyze the Department of Transportation driving under the influence data to identify in dividuals who may be in need of early intervention and potentially treatment services. The review of this data would also assist in ensuring the screening, assessment and treatment services provided to this high -risk population are effective. Mental Healt h Promotion and Early Identification of Mental Illness In order to enhance the health promotion services available in the state, i t is recommended that resources are dedicated to developing healthy communities to support individual s' behavioral health. The goal of these efforts would be to create an environment supportive of mental health and reducing the stigma of mental illness. Continuing with the goal of improving the early intervention services within the state's behavioral health system, i t is recom mended to support the implementation of consistent screenings for at - risk populations. In order to develop a plan to implement consistent screenings, collaborations with a variety of organizations and disciplines will be v ital, from the education system to long- term care . Continue to Support Public Service Delivery System Changes Relating to Core Services and Population In the e ffort to enhance services available to support an individual's behavioral health, i t is recommended to continue role clarification between the public and private behavioral health service delivery systems. T he public service delivery system 's primary role as chronic disease management, regional intervention services and 24 -hour crisis serv ices has been identified . It is also recomme nded that the public service delivery system continue to enhance building awareness of the se service changes. This may include increased communication to general public and stakeholders, holding regional meetings and providing information to consumers. Recognition of Behavioral Health Conditions as a Chronic Disease With the recognition of behavioral health conditions as chronic disease, it is vital that the services available follow chronic disease management principles. Aligning with these principles, it is recommended that access to community -based recovery supports are increased. These recovery supports include supported employment, supported living (including sober living), and recovery coaches (including peer support). It is also re commended to redu ce barriers to accessing already available recovery supports.

Integration of primary care and behavioral health are e ssential. As a core component of public health service provision, a modern behavioral health service system is accountable , organized , controls costs and improves quality , is accessible , equitable , and effective . It is a public health asset that improves the lives of Americans and lengthens their lifespan. The vision for a good and modern behavioral health system is grounded in a public health model that addresses the determinants of health, system and service coordination, health promotion, prevention, s creening and early intervention, treatment, resilience and recovery support to promote social integration and optimal health and productivity. The goal of a \"good\" and \"modern\" system of care is to provide a full range of high quality services to meet the range of age, gender, cultural and other needs presented. The interventions that are used in a good system should reflect the knowledge and technology that are available as part of modern medicine and include evidenced -informed practice; the system should recognize the critical connection between primary and specialty care and the key role of community supports with linkage to housing, employment, etc. A good system should also promote healthy behaviors and lifestyles, a primary driver of health outcomes. CORE STRUCTURES AND COMPETENCIES FOR A M ODERN SYSTEM 1. Workforce . The modern system must have experienced and competent organizations and staff. Recruitment and retention efforts will need to be enhanced, especially to increase the available pool of cultura lly, ethnically and racially diverse practitioners. Providers will need to embrace team -based care and collaboration with other systems as a way of doing business. Licensure requirements need to evolve and certification requirements need to be strengthened for those professions that do not currently require formal licensure. The workforce must also develop an improved ability to use technology to provide, manage and monitor quality care. Four critical efforts loom large: (1) redeployment of the shrinking professional workforce to positions of consultation and oversight; (2) augmentation of the existing workforce to include trained family, youth and peer supports as part of the paid workforce; (3) a more concerted pre -professional training effort to prepare new frontline and professional providers for the modern delivery system that is consumer - and family -driven, youth - guided, recovery/resiliency -oriented and evidence -based; and (4) a robust continuing training effort to develop, enhance, and sustain provid ers' capacity to access, interpret, and apply performance data and research findings on an ongoing basis to improve care. 43 Description of a Good and Modern Addictions and Mental Health Service System, Draft - April 18, 2011; http://www.samhsa.gov/sites /default/files/good_and_modern_4_18_2011_508.pdf Printed: Printed: 9/1/2017 11:34 AM - North Dakota - OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 09/30/2020 Page 222 of 224 Page | 29 PRINCIPLES These principles should apply to the provision of behavioral health services and cross the lifespan of individuals who need and use these services. Preventing and treating behavioral health disorders is integral to overall health. Services shown to be effective must be available to address current health and behavioral health disparities and be relevant to, and respond t o, the diverse cultures and languages of individuals and families. A wide range of effective services and supports should be available based on a range of acuity, disability, engagement levels and consumer preferences. The consumer's resilience and recove ry goals in their individualized service plan should dictate the services provided. The system should use information and science to deliver services. Services should be provided in convenient locations in order to reduce barriers, identify needs as early as possible, and engage individuals in care as early and as easily as possible. Wherever possible, the health system should support shared decision making with adult consumers, with youth and with families. Effective care management that promotes independence and resilience is key to coordinating health and specialty care. Service deli very must achieve high quality standards and results as well as outcomes that are measurable and are measured. Technology will be an important tool in delivering services. This includes telehealth, web -based applications and personal digital assistants th at assist individuals in their recovery. Increased use of technology will expand access to and coordinate care rather than always relying on location -based service delivery. Services that are proven effective or show promise of working will be funded and should be brought to scale; ineffective services and treatments that have not shown promise will not be funded. 2. Empowered Health Care Consumers . Health care consumers/families need information and tools to allow them to promote and reinforce their role as the center of the health care system. At a minimum, this will include a system that supports health literacy, shared decision making, and strategies for individuals and families to direct their own care. Shared decision making should become the standard of care for all treatment services. Participant direction of services allows individuals and their caregivers (when appropriate) to choose, supervise and in some instances, purchase the effective supports they need rather than relying on professionals to manage these supports. Health care consumers and families will also need access to user - friendly information on the effectiveness of available services in order that they may truly make informed health care decisions. 3. Information Technology . To achieve optimum individualized care, a modern health system should include a structure in which all holistic outcomes, measures and indicators of health are collected, stored and shared with the individual and all of those providers who are associated with care of t he individual. To that end, interoperable, integrated electronic health records will be necessary, as will community -wide indicators of behavioral health disorders. Additionally, appropriate security mechanisms and informed consent should drive this system while taking into account protection of individual rights and support to ensure appropriate linkages to services. 4. Funding and Payment Strategies . In the public sector, individuals/families/youth with complex mental and substance use disorders receive se rvices funded by federal, state, county and local funds. These multiple funding sources often result in a maze of eligibility, program and reporting specifications that create funding silos featuring complicated administrative requirements. If services are to be integrated, then dollars must be also intertwined. In the same way that Medicaid will be required to streamline eligibility and Printed: 9/1/2017 11:34 AM Page 29 of 30 Printed: 9/1/2017 11:34 AM - North Dakota - OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 09/30/2020 Page 223 of 224 Page | 30 enrollment, the good and modern system must either blend or braid funds in support of comprehensive service provision for consumers, youth and families. 5. Quality and Performance Management . Quality improvement through the use of outcomes and performance measures is a cornerstone of the Affordable Care Act. A renewed focus on quality will also help payers link performance im provement with payment while moving away from the current incentives to provide more care without evidence of improved outcomes. 6. Sustainable Practice Improvement . Key to a modern behavioral health system will be an ethic of \u2014and standard operating procedu res for \u2014continuous practice improvement to incorporate new evidence and to ensure more accountability, with a focus on \"practice - based evidence\" as well as evidence -based practice. Standards being developed by national organizations can guide providers (ag encies, group practices and individual practitioners) in their efforts to reshape their practice and to sustain changes over time. 7. Continued Partnerships . While the good and modern system focuses on the need for better integration of primary care and beha vioral health, this does not supplant the continued need to work with other systems that serve individuals with behavioral health disorders. Links between the good and modern system and the child welfare, criminal and juvenile justice, education and aging systems are more critical than ever.
