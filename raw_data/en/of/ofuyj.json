Case and Lorraine H. Case... fortunately, the apple had a good tree to land near . iv ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS An effort such as this dissertation is only made possible through the immeasurable support, mentorship, time and patience of many individuals. I am indebted to all who have helped along the way and made the current work a reality. This work was made possible by funding through the Garden Club of America and the American Foundation for Pharmaceutical Education. First and foremost, my thanks go to my major advisor, Dr. Guido Pauli, a man that I will forever respect as a paradigm to meticulous and diligent science. Thank you for having faith that this ethnobotanist could be competent in the lab, and for showing me how. Your intensity and passion for quality science will continue to serve as a model for me, wherever I go. Secondly, I'd like to thank my co-thesis advisor, Dr. D. Doel Soejarto. You have helped fulfill a child's dream of going to the jungles and to work with indigenous communities. Without you this leg of the adventure would never have come to fruition and I am truly grateful. I'd also like to thank others on my committee. Dr. Norman Farnsworth's dedication to his research, students and the entire field of pharmacognosy is a true measure of his persevering integrity. He and his open door have made my time at UIC immensely more valuable. Dr. Scott Franzblau has shown me the secrets behind great leadership. He ACKNOWLEDGMENTS (continued) vis the shining star and the sturdy foundation behind the Institute of Tuberculosis Research, and his kind ways are echoed in the smiling faces of all who have the pleasure in working there. I consider myself lucky to have been included. Dr. David Lentz has helped to fill in the small gaps that may have been missed by the pharmacognosists at UIC. His ethnobotanical expertise and insights have been greatly appreciated. Additionally, I'd like to thank Dr. Geoffrey Cordell for his guidance and support during his time as the director of graduate studies, without which I may never have found my way. I am also grateful to Dr. Charlotte Gyllenhaal for her ethnobotanical guidance and editing help over the years. I also like to thank Dr. Yuehong Wang, who conducted the MABA and Vero bioassays for all of the fractions and samples reported. She has shown me the beauty of how effective interdisciplinary collaboration can work with a little patience and a smile. Also, my thanks go to Dr. Sanghyun Cho for his help in establishing the bioassays at ITR and, of course, his ambidextrous volleyball spiking abilities. The work in Papua New Guinea would not have been made possible without the efforts of Dr. Lohi Matainaho. I have endless gratitude, both, for your steadfast dedication to collaboration, and for welcoming me in, like a member of your family. Also at the University of Papua New Guinea, I'd like to thank Pius Piskaut who performed the taxonomical identifications of the plants collected. No one deserves ACKNOWLEDGMENTS (continued) vithanks more than the numerous kind and loving people of Manus Island, in particular Michael Sapau, Pakop Buna, and their families. They took a stranger in and gave me a family on the other side of the world. Tenkyu no gut tru long olgeta samting! - Pokui. Other students and researchers deserve countless thanks for their help throughout my time at UIC. My thanks go to Dr. Luke Chadwick. Shared he has, infinite knowledge and passion, and forever his padawan, I shall be. I am also grateful to Dr. Brigit Jaki both for her extensive help in the lab and for occasionally managing to take Guido's mind off of work. Dr. Jun Chang gave significant help in my structural elucidation, and Dr. Shao-nong Chen assisted with HPLC fractionations (even though they didn't make it into the book). Thanks also go to Taichi Inui, my partner in the lab. Without you there for social and scientific conversations throughout the last 4 years, I think I would have gone insane, plus it was nice to have someone to share the blame when the music was too loud. I also would like to thank Drs. David Lankin and Alec Krunic for sharing their NMR expertise. To my ethnobotanical girls, Dr. Tatiana Lobo-Echevaria, Dr. Amanda Koch, Dr. Joanna Michel, and Amey Libman, people always seem to underestimate the benefits of having great discussions. If I could measure the quantity of education that I've acquired through our infinite conversations it may amount to more than I've obtained from the faculty. But, don't tell anyone that I said that! I'd also like to thank ACKNOWLEDGMENTS (continued) viiMarcy Balunas for her help in all aspects of sanity, life and research. Without her, I'd still be trying to fig ure out what an alpha value is. For his boundless IT help, I'd like to thank Sam Pro. And to the numerous other graduate students that have helped to keep me sane over the years by creating an intricate support system, otherwise known as Hawkeye's, cheers and thanks! Also I must thank those who have continually had faith in my abilities and potential over the last half a decade. I truly believe that I only survived the last five years as a result of having a deeply rooted foundation of love and support. For that I thank my family, Lorraine, David and Brandon Case. Finally, I am grateful to have found someone to stand beside me and continually remind me not to take life so seriously, especially when an experiment fails. So my final thanks go to Lisa Stemplewski. The only way to thank you properly would be to marry you and promise to always give you the level of love and support that you've given me. - R J C viii TABLE OF CONTENTS Acknowledgements................................................................................iv Table of Contents ................................................................................viii List of Tables........................................................................................xii List of Figures ..................................................................................... xiv Symbols and Abbreviations ..................................................... xviii Summary .......................................................................................... xxiv 1.

By combining the investigation of indigenous knowledge and biological evaluation, 43 species of plants showing various levels of anti-TB activity were identified. One of these plants, Dracaena angustifolia Roxb. (Dracaenaceae), was phytochemically investigated and supplied three highly active anti-TB compounds (MIC 1\u00b5g/ml). Concurrently, the current project sought to develop and test new methods and analyses in the fields of ethnobotany and phytochemistry as a broader contribution to efforts in establishing safe and effective anti- TB treatments from traditional medicines. These analyses and methods focused on several key specific aims. Chapter 2 details the assessment and correlation of cultural, geographical and physical factors within the Manus community with levels of knowledge of the local flora towards identifying factors in maintaining indigenous knowledge. Findings indicated that cultural subclass (favo ring Usiai), gender (favoring men), and habitation locality (favoring those living in villages far from Lorengau town) are significant factors in maintaining indigenous ethnobotanical knowledge. Additionally, medicinal plant knowledge was shown to be particularly vulnerable to loss during the acculturation process. Chapter SUMMARY (continued) xxv3 describes the documentation of the indigenous pharmacopoeia of Manus Province, Papua New Guinea, for any use related to respiratory ailments. Furthermore, the model, that informant consensus predicts potential for biological activity, was tested and concluded to be imprecise in predicting anti-mycobacterial activity from the indigenous pharmacopoeia related to respiratory ailments of the Manus. Chapter 4 focuses on the phytochemical characterization of D. angustifolia , which was identified as a high-priority Manus active anti-TB acid ( 3) and phytol ( 4) were isolated, identified and semi-quantitatively evaluated. Chapter 4 also details the evaluation of biochemometric characterization, a newly developed methodology that was shown to identify and correlate the anti-TB activity to chemical constituents from a crude plant fraction of D. angustifolia . Finally, the implications of these new methods and analyses provide for an efficient integrated approach for future anti-TB drug discovery from ethnopharmacological leads. 1 1. INTRODUCTION 1.1. TUBERCULOSIS -- THE PROBLEM 1.1.1. The global tuberculosis crisis It is estimated that one-third of the world's population tests positive for the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis , the tuberculosis pathogen. Of these cases, 8.8 million develop the disease each year (WHO, 2002b). Globally, tuberculosis results in the deaths of nearly 1.7 million people annually, giving it the distinction of the having the highest human mortality of all microbial species (Dye, et al., 1999; WHO, 2002b). Although many survive, they are forced into poverty and suffer with severe illness. The WHO estimates that if efforts do not change, by 2020, nearly 1 billion additional people will be newly infected with tuberculosis, 200 million people will become sick, and 35 million will die of the disease (WHO, 2002b). Additionally, with the HIV/AIDS pandemic, the tuberculosis crisis is only exacerbated as the susceptible population dramatically increases (Raviglione, et al., 1995). Two very important elements have led to problems in the management of tuberculosis: 1) endemism in countries primarily of the developing world, and 2) recent trends in drug-resistance (Cohn, et number of cases of tuberculosis in the US has managed a steady decline since 1992, the rates of cases per 100,000 people are still above the goal set in the 2 national strategic plan for the elimination of the disease (CDC, 2003). Due to the advent of international air travel, geographic isolation has become less effective as a control measure. As a result, in order to achieve the elimination of tuberculosis in the US, we must collaborate in reducing the global tuberculosis problem (CDC, 2003; Shaywitz and Ausiello, 2002; West, 2003). 1.1.2. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is an aerobic, rod-shaped, acid-fast bacillus ranging from 1 to 4 \u00b5m long. It is one of more than 60 species within the genus Mycobacterium and shares the characteristics of being slow-growing (with a 24-hour generation time vs. 20-40 minutes for bacteria), and non-spore-forming bacteria (Heifets, 1997). Due to the waxy outer layer of its cell wall, M. tuberculosis does not stain well with the Gram stain and, alternatively, requires the use of the Ziehl-Neelson or fluorochrome stains (Peloquin and Berning, 1994). Other than Mycobacterium leprae , the pathogen for leprosy, instances where other Mycobacterium species, such as M. kansaii, M. fortuitum , and M. avium complex, have acted as human pathogens, are rare and usually have been found in immuno-compromised individuals, such as those with AIDS. Therefore, they are not considered to represent a serious threat to human health (Pitchenik and Fertel, 1992). 3 The transmission of M. tuberculosis occurs through droplet nuclei that are passed person to person when an infected person coughs or sneezes (Haas and Des Prez, 1995). It was demonstrated in the 1950s, that air circulating in a hospital ward could spread infection from infected TB patients to guinea pigs. Transmission in this manner was prevented when the air was filtered or exposed to ultraviolet radiation (Riley, et al., 1959). While those in contact with pulmonary TB patients have a 30% chance of infection, those in contact with laryngeal TB patients have a higher chance of infection, due to the ability of the Mycobacterium pathogen to be transmitted through conversation (Pitchenik and Fertel, 1992). Two types of tuberculosis are present in those infected with M. tuberculosis : 1) asymptomatic or latent tuberculosis, and 2) active tuberculosis. The latent form, found in one-third of the world population, is most commonly detected using the tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test, a luxury that is predominantly utilized in the developed world (Sbarbaro, 1986). Those who carry the latent form of tuberculosis are estimated to have, roughly, a 10% chance of developing active TB. This rate dramatically increases in certain groups of the population, such as children, the elderly, those malnourished, and most drastically, those that are immunocompromised, for example, patients infected with HIV, who are more than 100 times more likely to develop active TB (1992; McCray, et al., 1997). Active TB patients exhibit 4 symptoms of weight loss, fever, night sweats, malaise, and general pneumonial symptoms. As pulmonary TB, the most common form of the disease, develops in the lungs, production of sputum leads to a persistent cough that may include blood (1990; Haas and Des Prez, 1995; Peloquin and Berning, 1994). Untreated pulmonary TB continues to spread throughout the respiratory tract and will eventually lead to hypoxia, respiratory acidosis and, often, death (Haas and Des Prez, 1995). Extrapulmonary tuberculosis is difficult to diagnose due to the unusual and varied indications. In cases of tubercular meningitis and cranial tuberculomas, it often infects organs in the central nervous system, but can also infect organs of the genitourinary, lymphatic, and skeletal systems, as well as the liver and adrenal glands. Just as in pulmonary TB, untreated extrapulmonary TB will spread and often result in death (Haque, 1990). 1.1.3. TB chemotherapy Chemotherapy of patients with active TB is a complicated process that, when resources are available, include susceptibility analysis of the M. tuberculosis isolated from the patients (Peloquin and Berning, 1994). The more realistic option in the developing world is analysis of the drug resistance pattern in the area where the TB was acquired. Inaccurate analyses of drug susceptibility can lead to serious compromises in the treatment regimen. 5 Numerous drugs are available for treatment of active TB. They are divided into two categories, primary or first-line drugs, and secondary or second-line drugs. Drug regimens, even for cases of tuberculosis uncomplicated by drug resistance, consist of 3-4 drugs over 6 months (see Appendix A). Drug regimens of multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) often include 5 or more drugs over 18 months and with a an estimated cost of up to $180,000 per patient (Crofton, et al., 1997). Isoniazid ( INH) and rifampin (syn. Rifampicin) ( RIF) are the two main drugs used in tuberculosis treatment, though other weaker drugs exist as primary drugs to be used in combination with the former two, in order to shorten the duration of treatment and decrease the development of drug resistance (Peloquin and Ebert, 1999). Table 1 presents the current drugs, with MICs and structural information, currently used in the treatment of TB. Since 1944, with the discovery of streptomycin ( SM), chemotherapy has become the premier method of managing TB. Unfortunately, from nearly the moment drugs became available for the treatment of TB, resistance became a problem, with acquired resistance to streptomycin, resistance appearing within months of its use (Dormandy, 2000). Combination drug therapy soon followed, thanks to the discovery of para-aminosalycilic acid ( PAS) and has been used since. 6 Table 1.

Drug resistance in tuberculosis Drug resistance in tuberculosis is a result of inefficient drug therapy that eliminated susceptible strains, while allowing strains with spontaneous mutations for drug resistance to proliferate (acquired resistance), and, eventually, transmit infection to other susceptible hosts (primary resistance) (Figure 1). This type of resistance can occur from single drug treatment, inaccurate prescriptions, and frequently, patient noncompliance to drug regimens, often due to inconsistent drug supply. Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), which is resistant to rifampin and isoniazid, the two most effective antitubercular drugs on the market, is the most dangerous form of TB. Second- and third-line drug regimens are not only more likely to fail due to drug resistance, but are also, in general, more toxic and expensive (Mahmoudi and Iseman, 1993). Cases of MDR-TB are found throughout the world, but occur in less than 2% of global TB cases. Alarmingly, in certain countries where there is poor tuberculosis surveillance and treatment, such as in Eastern Europe and Asia, MDR-TB rates have been as high as 13% of new cases of TB (Espinal, 2003; Pablos-Mendez, et al., 2002). Meanwhile, acquired MDR-TB levels have reached as high as 48% in Nepal, and 30.1% in New York City (Cohn, et al., 1997). The MDR-TB problem calls for improved TB surveillance, drug administration, and compliance to drug regimens and, 8 above all, new methods of antitubercular treatments (WHO/IUTLD, 1997). Figure 1. The development and spread of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis [adapted from WHO/IUTLD (WHO/IUTLD, 1997)]. 1.1.5. HIV complications Currently, TB is undergoing one of the largest resurgences in years, due to the development of MDR strains and the rise of the HIV pandemic. While HIV has not been shown to increase the transmission of TB, it significantly amplifies the risk of transition from the latent condition to the active stages of the disease. As noted previously, it is Wild M. tuberculosis Acquired Drug Resistance (single, then MDR-TB) Primary Drug Resistance (single drug or MDR-TB)Isolated strains with Genetic Drug-resistanceSpontaneous Mutation Selection (single drug treatment, inaccurate prescriptions, noncompliance) TransmissionWild M. tuberculosis Wild M. tuberculosis Acquired Drug Resistance (single, then MDR-TB)Acquired Drug Resistance (single, then MDR-TB) Primary Drug Resistance (single drug or MDR-TB)Primary Drug Resistance (single drug or MDR-TB)Isolated strains with Genetic Drug-resistanceIsolated strains with Genetic Drug-resistanceSpontaneous Mutation Selection (single drug treatment, inaccurate prescriptions, noncompliance) Transmission 9 estimated that HIV patients, especially those in AIDS stage, have 100 times the chances of developing active TB. As a result, HIV patients are categorized as extremely high risk TB patients (Alland, et al., 1994; Daley, et al., 1992). Globally, TB is the leading cause of death among HIV patients, in which 11% of all AIDS deaths are due to opportunistic TB infection. Similarly, HIV attributes to 12% of tuberculosis deaths (Corbett, et al., 2003). However, this number significantly varies, depending on the region of the world being examined, from Africa, which has 39% of TB deaths due to HIV, to Europe, which only has 2%. New cases of active TB among HIV patients are comparable in number. Globally, 9% of TB deaths is attributed to HIV, with 31% in Africa. High levels also occur in certain industrialized nations, such as the US, where 26% of all new cases of active TB were caused by HIV. Physiologically, when a patient is infected with M. tuberculosis , CD4 lymphocytes with mycobactericidal activity multiply in response to infection. If the person is infected with HIV, the virus will proliferate and destroy these cells, rendering the person compromised in battling active infection (Orme, et al., 1993). At the same time, there is evidence that tuberculosis infection in patients with HIV accelerates the progression towards AIDS (Pape, et al., 1993). Serum 2-microglobulin concentration, a marker compound of HIV progression, increases with tuberculosis infection (Wallis, et al., 1993). Therefore, tuberculosis and HIV become mutually more dangerous in co-infected patients, especially in untreated cases (Pape, et 10 al., 1993). As a result, drug regimens are often extended to 9-12 months in HIV patients (Haas and Des Prez, 1995; Peloquin and Berning, 1994). Furthermore, certain antitubercular chemotherapies, such as rifampin, are not appropriate due to drug interactions with HIV medications. Rifampin induces hepatic enzymes leading to a boost in drug metabolism, and does not combine well with protease inhibitors that are commonly used to treat HIV patients (Lacy, et al., 2003). With HIV cases on the rise, especially in developing countries where TB is also more prevalent, the need for new therapies and management strategies is critical. 1.1.6. Management of tuberculosis in the developing world Compared to industrialized nations, tuberculosis in the developing world, exacerbated by drug resistance, and possibly HIV, is extremely difficult to control. Expensive drug therapies are often financially inaccessible, geographically impractical, and culturally irrelevant to the people of the developing world (Cegielski, et al., 2002; Pablos-Mendez, et al., 2002). Herbal treatment, however, presents the potential to provide an affordable, available, culturally relevant method to manage tuberculosis. Currently, botanicals are the most competent way to bridge the gap between isolated developing cultures and modern science. Recently, this trend has been seen within the health market of the developed world. The attraction of herbal, alternative medicine, is 11 attributed to the power of its underlying shared beliefs and cultural assumptions both here, in the US, and in developing countries (Eisenberg, et al., 1998; Kaptchuk and Eisenberg, 1998; Tyler, 1999). The search for botanical remedies for tuberculosis is not a new concept (Frame, et al., 1998; Graham, et al., 2003; Jimenez-Arellanes, et al., 2003; Meyer, 1999; Murillo-Alvarez, et al., 2001; Newton, et al., 2002). The problem with many of the studies on medicinal plants is the common (mis)interpretation of the researcher that a single active compound is responsible for biological activity. This ignores the concept of synergy, as well as the beliefs and attitudes that provide the benefits of botanicals (Williamson, 2001). Modern medicine, in the US, requires scientific evidence (Ember, 1998; Fontanarosa and Lundberg, 1998). Unfortunately, botanical use in the developing world is often based on empirical evidence. Scientific evaluation of safety and activity has only occurred for a small percentage of utilized botanicals (Akerele, 1988; Miller, et al., 2004; Sehon and Stanley, 2003). As botanicals attain a more prominent role in modern health care, the quality, safety and activity of these products must be assessed. 1.1.7. Plants with anti-TB activity The pharmacognostic investigation of plants as a source of new anti-tubercular drugs has led to the discovery and isolation of compounds with a wide range of structural skeletons. While many of 12 these compounds may not have the potency to serve as a new anti- tubercular pharmaceutical, they provide data on structure-activity relationships and strengthen the drug discovery process. One excellent review presented 352 compounds that have shown activity against Mycobacteria and have been isolated from natural sources (Copp, 2003). Of these, 133 were isolated from terrestrial plants. Another excellent review of anti-mycobacterial natural products was also published in 2004 (Okunade, et al., 2004). Compounds with potent anti- mycobacterial activity from plants are presented in Appendix B. One example of a simple alkyne with anti-tuberculosis activity is Triyne, isolated from Solidago canadensis L.. Triyne was found to inhibit M. tuberculosis H 37Rv with an MIC of 25 \u00b5g/ml (Lu, et al., 1998). (4Z, 8Z)-matricaria lactone, isolated from Erigeron philadelphicus L., with an MIC of 12.5 \u00b5g/ml, is believed by the authors to be acting as a Michael acceptor and irreversibly inhibiting mycobacterial enzymes due to the ,-unsaturated -lactone moiety (Lu, et al., 1998). This moiety was determined to be essential, but not sufficient for significant in vitro activity against M. tuberculosis (Fischer, et al., 1998) . Recently, micormolide, was isolated from Micromelum hirsutum Merr. and shown to potently inhibit tuberculosis growth with a MIC of 1.5 \u00b5g/ml (Ma, et al., 2005). Ethnobotanically identified Oplopanax horridus (Sm.) Miq. (Devil's Club) yielded farcarindiol and related compounds, all of which inhibited M. tuberculosis at 10 \u00b5g/disc in a disc diffusion assay (Kobaisy, et al., 13 1997). Phenolic compounds, 6-, 8-, and 10-gingerol, were isolated from Zingiber officinale Roscoe and increasingly inhibited M. tuberculosis H37Rv as lipophicity increased (Hiserodt, et al., 1998). Similarly, the lipophilic long chain fatty acid ester isolated from Buddleja cordata Kunth had an MIC of 64 \u00b5g/ml against M. tuberculosis H37Rv, while a number of other homologs isolated from the same plant were inactive (Acevedo, et al., 2000). Flavonoids and coumarins, such as and 3- phenylcoumarin indicanine B, isolated from Glycyrrhiza glabra L. and Erythrina indica Lam., respectively, have been found to have mycobacterial inhibition with MICs of 25 and 18.5 \u00b5g/ml, and Baker, 1998a; Mitscher and Baker, 1998b; Waffo, et al., 2000). Structure-activity relationships have been demonstrated in plant alkaloids with anti-mycobacterial properties. The presence of a 4- methoxy group and a fully aromatic quinoline ring have been shown to improve activity of quinoline alkaloids isolated from Galipea officinalis J. Hancock (Houghton, et al., 1999). Peterson et. al. concluded that substitution at the 3-position or the 4,5-benzo ring fusion aided anti- mycobacterial activity through studying tetracylic plant metabolites, such as sampangine and 3-methoxysampangine isolated previously from Cananga odorata (Lam.) Hook. & Thomson and Cleistopholis patens Engl. & Diels, respectively (Liu, et al., Mitscher and Baker, 1998b; Peterson, et al., 1992). E-phytol, of terpenoid origin, was isolated from Leucas volkensii G\u00fcrke and shown to have an MIC of 2 \u00b5g/ml 14 (Rajab, et al., 1998). Sharing a class with phytol is (+)-totarol, isolated from Xanthocyparis nootkatensis (D. Don) Farjon & D. Harder, which has an MIC of 16 \u00b5g/ml (Constantine, et al., 2001). Three secokaurane diterpenes were isolated from Croton kongensis Gagnep. and shown to inhibit M. tuberculosis with MICs ranging from 6.25 to 25 \u00b5g/ml (Thongtan, et al., 2003). The two cylcoartane triterpenoids isolated from Borrichia frutescens (L.) DC. isolated with an MIC of 8 \u00b5g/ml and have been shown to lose antitubercular activity with acetylation, cyclopropyl ring opening or side-chain modification (Cantrell, et al., 1996). Cycloartenol was shown to inhibit M. tuberculosis with an MIC of 32 \u00b5g/ml after being isolated from Morinda citrifolia L. (Saludes, et al., 2002). Several steroids have also been shown to inhibit M. tuberculosis , such as ergosterol-5,8-endoperoxide, isolated from Ajuga remota Benth., had an MIC of 1 \u00b5g/ml, but the 3-acetate derivative was found to be eight times less potent (Cantrell, et al., 1999). Well known steroids, stigmasterol, epidoxysterol and a mixture of stigmasta-4-en-3-one and stigmasta-4,22-dien-3-one were isolated from Morinda citrifolia and shown to have MICs of 32, 2.5 and 2.0 \u00b5g/ml, respectively (Saludes, et al., 2002). A jujubogenin saponin was shown to inhibit M. tuberculosis with an MIC of 10 \u00b5g/ml, after being isolated from Colubrina retusa (Pittier) R.S. Cowan (ElSohly, et al., 1999). Finally, physalin D, isolated from Physalis angulata L. was shown to have an MIC of 32 \u00b5g/ml against M. tuberculosis (Januario, et al., 2002). 15 Due to the complexities in drug targeting and the majority of the mechanisms of action of antitubercular drugs being unknown it is difficult to draw complete structure-activity relationships from unrelated compounds. As new molecular targeted bioassays are developed, such as mycolic acid biosynthesis or cell wall biosynthesis, it will become easier to draw conclusions on structural relationships (Douglas, et al., 2002; Lee, et al., 2003; Ma, et al., 2001). Nevertheless, as has been shown above, antitubercular activity can be found in a diverse range of structural classes from a variety of botanical sources from throughout the world. 1.2. ETHNOBOTANY AND TRADITIONAL MEDICINE One of the most promising methods to identify new herbal medicines is through studying herbal traditional medicine of indigenous groups around the globe. After all, with 25% of modern pharmaceuticals having been derived from traditionally used plants, there is significant evidence that traditional medicine has the potential to play a strong role in modern drug development (WHO, 2003). The collaborative effort between indigenous communities and natural product drug discovery scientists is inherent in the work of ethnobotanists. Even before John Harshberger coined the word ethnobotany in 1895, healers and botanists had been studying the connection between plants and medicine. Now, over a century later, the field has developed into not only studying what 16 plants are being used, but also how they are being used, why they are being used, and how knowledge of their use is being maintained, modified and, in unfortunate circumstances, lost (Case, et al., 2005; Galeano, Stagegaard, et al., 2002). 1.3. STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM Whether in the form of new drug compounds or safe and effective herbal therapies, new inexpensive therapies for tuberculosis are greatly needed. Supplementing the currently recommended TB treatment with additional effective anti-tubercular agents would further reduce the probability of treatment failure/relapse due to drug resistance (Pablos- Mendez, et al., 2002). At the same time, it has been shown that, based on the assumption that \"prolonged and apparently uneventful use\" of a plant suggests safety, plants identified by local populations for medicinal purposes have been shown to have correlating biological activity (Elisabetsky and Wannmacher, 1993; Schuster, 2001). The current study attempts to prove whether or not the circumstances in Manus Province, Papua New Guinea, follow the above supposition, by combining the investigation of indigenous knowledge and cutting-edge natural products chemistry in the pursuit of a culturally relevant anti-tuberculosis treatment. Concurrently, the development and testing of methodology in both fields will allow a broader contribution to 17 efforts in establishing safe and effective treatments from traditional medicines. Therefore, the Specific Aims of this project are: AIM 1. To assess and correlate the levels of knowledge of the local flora to cultural, geographical and physical factors in an attempt to identify factors in maintaining indigenous knowledge. AIM 2. To document the indigenous pharmacopoeia of Manus Province, Papua New Guinea, for any use related to respiratory ailments. AIM 3. To evaluate the model that informant consensus from ethnomedical studies predicts potential for biological activity. AIM 4. To phytochemically characterize a high priority Manusian ethnobotanical based on its anti-TB bioactivity. AIM 5. To evaluate newly developed biochemometric methodology in its potential to identify and correlate active constituents from a crude plant fraction. AIM 6. To assess the experimental results from aims 1-5 and develop an integrated approach for future anti-TB drug discovery from ethnobotanicals. 18 2. ETHNOBOTANY OF MANUS ISLAND 2.1. BACKGROUND 2.1.1. Geographic location of Manus Island, Papua New Guinea Manus Province (104 km by 30km) is the smallest and most isolated province of Papua New Guinea (Minol, 2000). While the overall land area is a mere 2,100 sq. km, it spans 220,000 sq. km of marine territory that encompasses the 208 islands of the province. It is mostly covered by secondary tropical forest (Minol, 2000). 2.1.2. People and culture Manus Island The inhabitants of Manus Island have a resilient cultural heritage that has persisted despite extensive exposure to developed societies, including German colonization, anthropological study, and armed infiltration during World War II (Minol, 2000). Margaret Mead, while controversial, changed the face of modern anthropology while studying the Manus in the 1920s (Mead, 1963; 1968; Murray and Darnell, 2000; Romanucci-Ross, 1985). World War II pitted Manus between Japanese and American forces, and led to the establishment of an American airfield on Los Negros Island. The Manus were inundated by the American lifestyle, as it was estimated that over a million soldiers passed 19 through during this time (Minol, 2000). Despite this overwhelming exposure to the Western world, the Manus maintained many of their cultural practices, including their indigenous languages, of which more than 30 survive today (Minol, 2000). Additionally, the inhabitants of Manus Province have a reputation for being a highly educated subpopulation within the country of Papua New Guinea, with a literacy rate of more than 60%. The Manus have consistently played a valuable role in the political and economic infrastructure of the country (Minol, 2000). 2.1.3. Healthcare on Manus Island Lorengau, the single town of the Manus Province, with a population of nearly 7,000, contains only one five-bed hospital. Additional health care is provided by nine health centers and 74 aid posts that serve an estimated 43,000 people found in 192 villages within the province (Minol, 2000). The geographical isolation of the province makes getting modern pharmaceuticals to the villagers extremely difficult. Most pharmaceuticals for Manus Province are produced in Japan, purchased by the Australians (through AusAID, the Australian Government's overseas aid program), shipped to the national capital of Port Moresby to be divided amongst provinces, then shipped to the main provincial hospitals (in the case of Manus, the single hospital), and finally distributed amongst health centers and aid posts. As a result, it 20 is common that drugs may take over a year, to reach an aid post. Consequently, many of the Manus rely on the use of traditional remedies for most illnesses. 2.1.4. Herbal medicine in Manus Island Some locally used medicinal plants of Manus Island have been documented in the early seventies and eighties (Holdsworth and N'Drawii, 1973; Holdsworth and Wamoi, 1982). In a study from 1982, Holdsworth discusses the impressive \"self-reliance\" of the Manus on traditional herbal medicines, highlighted by the Plitty Health Centre [today, defunct], a health center where patients were treated entirely with traditional herbs (Holdsworth and Wamoi, 1982). This health center, founded in 1970, consisted of six hospital wards with twelve locally trained nurses and two main herbalists. It treated an estimated 500 patients annually and often received patients referred by the Provincial Hospital in Lorengau (Holdsworth and Wamoi, 1982). Informants of the current project explained that Plitty Health Centre was closed after the death of the second herbalist, estimated to have occurred in the late 1980s or early 1990s. Throughout the province, herbal practitioners have disappeared as a formal occupation within the local culture. Aid- posts and reliance on hospitals have greatly reduced the use of herbal medicine. With the disappearance of recognized herbalists among the 21 people of Manus Province, medicinal plant usage has been reduced to the level of an individual family in diagnosis and treatment. The study of herbal medicines in Papua New Guinea is not a new concept. The most specific endeavor that relates to this project began in 1973 when David Holdsworth, a researcher from the University of Papua New Guinea, studied and wrote on the \"Medicinal and Poisonous Plants from Manus Island\". It was the first of many papers that would eventually take Dr. Holdsworth throughout Papua New Guinea, documenting the plants that the indigenous people used as he was covering such a vast geographical area and a broad medicinal focus, his studies were intended to be cursory, yet inspirational to other researchers to continue the work in more depth. This project can be viewed as a deeper inquiry and a continuation of Dr. Holdsworth's research. A restricted geographical 22 and biological focus allowed this project to delve deeper into the subject of culturally utilized medicinal plants and their role in treating tuberculosis. The Papua New Guinean government acknowledges the importance of and embraces herbal research, and made the following statement within its national health plan: \"Herbal medicine forms an important and integral part of traditional medicinal practices in Papua New Guinea; however there is little recognition of and documentation on the commonalities, identities and uses of these plants. The national health services would benefit if this field of medicine was further explored and incorporated into the health care system\" (WHO, 2000). The lack of knowledge and funding in Papua New Guinea for this type of work forced a reliance on collaborative efforts with institutions in more developed nations. 2.1.5. Hypothesis and rationale of study From metropolitan gentrification of local immigrant communities to indigenous relocation, minority cultures continue to become increasingly endangered. Development and globalization aggressively continue around the world and the harm and consequence of forming a single coalesced society must be acknowledged. With these actions comes the eminent indigenous acculturation and loss of previously isolated and eccentric customs and knowledge (Dennett and Connell, 1988; Kingsbury, 2001; 23 Romanucci-Ross, et al., 1997; Schultes, 1994). Many difficulties arise when attempting to assess and quantify the loss of indigenous knowledge. One strategy employed to assess the level of the loss of knowledge is through the ethnobotanical study of the local flora among indigenous groups currently undergoing acculturation. Cultures around the globe rely heavily on the use of plants in all aspects of daily life, from food and shelter to medicine and religious piety (Farnsworth, et al., 1985; WHO, 2002c). As the acculturation process occurs at the local level, comparisons of knowledge among people from different levels of development within the same community are possible (Lewis, 2003). The aim of this study was to analyze the amount of knowledge that the indigenous population of Manus Island, Papua New Guinea possessed and to compare levels of knowledge of the local flora to physical, geographical and social variables. These findings may provide information on the factors that play a role in maintaining indigenous knowledge. By comparing the levels of knowledge among different informant groups within indigenous communities, it may be possible to identify patterns on the loss of knowledge, thus, facilitating efforts in the maintenance of indigenous knowledge. 24 2.2. METHODOLOGY 2.2.1. Collaborative arrangement and legal aspects Before ethnopharmacological fieldwork could be performed, agreements had to be established between the University of Papua New Guinea (UPNG), which represents the Papua New Guinea government, the indigenous community on Manus, and the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). After nearly two years of negotiations, with the PI acting as liaison between UIC and UPNG, a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) was ratified by the board of trustees of UIC and the Vice Chancellor of UPNG. This agreement (see Appendix C), which is valid until September, 2008, deals with the rights and responsibilities of the parties in collaborative research projects and covers the topics of intellectual property rights and access to biogenetic resources. A preliminary trip to Manus Island during 2003 was successful in establishing agreements with the community to perform ethnopharmacological fieldwork and is documented with support from the provincial leaders, in particular, Lord Mayor Michael Sapau. Additionally, Institutional Review Board approval had to be obtained for the proposed project's human subject work, namely, the ethnobotanical interviews (see Appendix D). This addresses the issues of prior informed consent and interview protocols (see Appendix E). Further investigation could only be pursued once agreements between 25 UIC, UPNG, and the Manus community had been established and IRB approval obtained. 2.2.2. Field sites Ethnobotanical fieldwork was conducted in eight villages on Manus Island and in the lone town of Lorengau (Figure 2). Figure 2 Study sites: Eight villages and Lorengau Town on Manus Island, Papua New Guinea 26 2.2.3. Ethnobotanical interviews Over a four-month period, from August to December 2003, 45 semi-structured interviews were conducted with indigenous people of Manus Island, Papua New Guinea, using the ethnobotanical notebook strategy. This method was a modified version of the Inventory and Interview method of Boom, and the \"walk-in-the-woods\" approach of Phillips and Gentry, in order to allow efficiency in conducting identical interviews in geographically diverse villages throughout Manus Province (Alexiades, 1996; Boom, 1987; Phillips and Gentry, 1993a). Care was taken to get a representative sample of informants for the physical (gender, age), geographical (habitat localities) and social (cultural subclass) variables tested. The ethnobotanical notebook consisted of voucher herbarium specimens and several photographs for each of the 105 arboreal species collected for the project. Plants contained in the notebook were collected semi-randomly and were later confirmed to be found throughout the province. This method enables structured, reproducible data for statistical analysis and hypothesis testing. Each interview lasted approximately 60 minutes. While English is the national language of commerce and politics in Papua New Guinea, Tok Pisin (Pidgin English) is commonly used as a social language. For this reason, interviews were conducted in Tok Pisin. Following a brief session to obtain prior informed consent and to gather personal data on each interviewee, participants were asked three main questions for each entry 27 in the ethnobotanical notebook, namely, if the interviewee (1) recognized the plant, (2) knew the plant's name, and (3) knew a use for the plant. Plant uses were grouped into six categories based on the results obtained from a previous trip to Manus Island; these are construction uses, craft uses, food uses, medicinal uses, charm uses, and other uses. Responses on plant use were assigned a category at the time of the recording by the interviewer during the interview. Categories were not revealed to the interviewees, in order to avoid altering future responses. All research activities strictly followed the protocols and the terms and conditions as stated in the MOA between the University of Papua New Guinea and the University of Illinois at Chicago, thus, ensuring effective collaboration and resolutions to the issues of genetic resources and intellectual property rights. All human subject work was performed in accordance with the UIC IRB protocol number 2003-0294 approved on July 13, 2003. 2.2.4. Voucher specimen preparation Plants for the ethnobotanical notebook were collected based on a biodiversity approach to maximize taxonomic diversity. Preference was not given to fertile specimens, as that would indicate a bias in the collection. Ethnobotanical knowledge often relies on the identification of plants, independent of their flowering or fruiting status. Voucher specimens were pressed between folds of newspaper and corrugated 28 cardboard, bound into a plant press and dried in the sun. Taxonomic identification of the plants collected was made in the field and later verified at the Herbarium of the University of Papua New Guinea in Port Moresby by Professor Pius Piskaut of the University of Papua New Guinea. Voucher specimens are deposited at the National Herbarium at the University of Papua New Guinea and at the John G. Searle Herbarium of the Field Museum, Chicago. Voucher specimens were washed with a dilute bleach solution to remove fungus, then mounted on acid-free paper and filed according to species and source continent. All species noted in the following text are documented by the voucher specimens listed in Appendix F. 2.2.5. Statistical analysis and hypotheses Quantitative analysis of the relationship between several interviewee categories, such as gender, age, cultural subclass, and habitat locality, and plant recognition, identification, knowledge of use, and knowledge of medicinal use was performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA), linear regression and t-tests using SAS software (SAS Institute Inc. 2001; SAS System for Windows, Release 8e. SAS Inst. Cary, NC). Several null hypotheses were tested to compare the interviewee's relative knowledge with different social and geographical variables. These hypotheses were stated as follows: 29 Ho1 - There is no difference between the means of the percentage of plants recognized, identified, used, or used medicinally by people from different cultural subclasses (Usiai, Titan, Matangkol) . Ho2 - There is no difference between the means of the percentage of plants recognized, identified, used, or used medicinally by peop le living in the interior of the island versus those living on the coast . Ho3 - There is no difference between the means of the percentage of plants recognized, identified, used, or used medicinally by people from different age groups (18-30, 31-40, 41-50, 51-60, >60) . Ho4 - There is no difference between the means of the percentage of plants recognized, identified, used , or used medicinally by men versus women . Ho5 - There is no difference betwee n the mean percentage of plants recognized, identified, used, or used medicinally by p eople living in Lorengau town versus those living in villages . Ho6 - The percentage of plants reco gnized, identified, used, or used medicinally by people will not vary based on the distance they live from Lorengau town . 30 2.3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 2.3.1. Quantitative analysis Due to the diversity of languages on the island, interviews spanned 13 languages, among 45 research participants. This made the analysis of common names difficult, as plant names were given in the village language of each interviewee. In certain cases it was apparent that two interviewees had identified the same ethnobotanical notebook entry with the same name even though they spoke different languages. For example, several different names were given for ethnobotanical notebook entry # 84, Alstonia scholaris R. Br. (Apocynaceae). While one can be confident that Sipwel, Sipou, Sibuh, Sibuei and Cipwei are similar common names for the plant by following the phonetic chain, one cannot determine if other names such as Spon, Raba, Pegang and Pekang are common names in different languages, or a misidentification. Manus plant names are often passed on as oral tradition through the generations, and are specific to the \"tok ples\" (local language) in which they are found. It was clear that generations of intermarriage between tok ples groups and the lack of written language are responsible for similar (if not identical) plant names in different local languages. Table 2 illustrates the linguistic diversity of common plant names in Manus Province with a subset of ethnobotanically collected plants, specifically used for the treatment of tuberculosis and persistent respiratory 31 conditions. Due to the lack of documentation of official common names, no efforts have been made to validate the accuracy of the common names given and/or to qualify informant data. Other data are presented quantitatively, though it must be noted that there is a remaining element of uncertainty due to the inability to decipher some informant responses. 32 Table 2. Common names given for plants used in the treatment of tuberculosis and persistent respiratory conditions Species match voucher specimens reported in Appendix F. Plant name Common Table 2.

They are the Usiai, who, in general, live among the densely forested interior of the island; the Titan, sea-faring people who live along the coast; and the Matangkol, a group that exists as a result of the overlapping generations between the other two cultural subclasses, located throughout the island. The null hypothesis (H o1) was rejected and it was shown that the Usiai were significantly more knowledgeable than the Titan in the percentage of plants identified ( P=0.015) and cited for a use ( P=0.021) (Figure 3). This difference is due to the behavioral distinctions between the two subcultures. The Titan, who were brought to fame through the work of Margaret Mead, are the more commonly recognized population of Manus Province, often being referred to among non-Manus Papua New Guineans as the \"Manus\" (Mead, 1963; 1968; Roll and Roll, 1984; Romanucci-Ross, 1985). They live along the coast in concentrated villages of sago ( Metroxylon sagu Rottb. or Metroxylon rumphii C. Martius, Arecaceae) thatched huts on stilts over the ocean. This is because, typically, Titan people are not landowners, but are simply granted permission to occupy land along the coast by their Usiai neighbors. Their diets consist of mostly fish and other staples provided by the ocean (sea turtle, mud crabs, etc.), and there is little general use of terrestrial plants in daily life. 35 Figure 3. Comparison of plant knowledge between different cultural subclasses in Manus Province. Columns represent the percentage of plants cited by informants of that cultural subclass for each knowledge category. Significantly different groups (a=0.10) are marked with asterisks; P-values were analyzed using (SAS) based ANOVA for unequal sample sizes. Usiai, in contrast, live in the interior of the island, own their land, as it is passed down through generations, and, as a result, may live several kilometers from the nearest neighboring family. Typically, Usiai villages have a center located within one to two hours of walking from the families of that village, where a church, an aid post, and a school are located. Their diet consists primarily of sago pith that is beaten, cleaned and fried, supplemented with cassava, bananas, 36 pineapple, papaya, and coconut, though, the Manus have always had an effective system of bartering where Usiai and Titan meet to trade fish for sago and coconut oil (Romanucci-Ross, 1990). The Usiai's closer ties to the use of plants in daily life are apparent. It is interesting to note that there is not a significant difference between the percentage of plants recognized or between the percentage of plants identified as being used as medicines among the different cultural subclasses. Current cultural roles have become less and less defined between the two groups, aided by the establishment of the Matangkol cultural subclass. While many Usiai are learning to fish, many Titans have also begun using the forest as a resource. The data indicate that while Titans recognized many of the plants in the ethnobotanical notebook, they did not know a name or a use for them. Interviews within the different cultural subclasses indicated that despite the cultural group of the informants, plant knowledge was found to be taught to younger generations by parents and older relatives. Interviewees would often assign their parents as the responsible party for their lack of knowledge of unknown plants or plant uses. Often informants indicated that they felt their parents would know more than they did, and offered to go retrieve them if they were available. The lack of significance between Titan and Usiai medicinal plant knowledge may be interpreted as a result of the small number of medicinal plants utilized by the Manus population in general (less than 10% of plants were given medicinal 37 uses), or it may infer that medicinal plant use was the first ethnobotanical knowledge the Titan people sought to learn. Matangkol knowledge levels were found to be between the Titan and Usiai levels, without a significant difference from either group. Interviews within the different cultural subclasses indicated that despite the cultural group of the informants, plant knowledge was found to be taught to younger generations by parents and older relatives. As cross-cultural marriages have become more frequent, there has been an increase in the diversity of knowledge, yet, an overall reduction in the quantity of botanical knowledge occurred. This is understandable since cultural pride is reduced at the mixing and intermarriage between groups. While it was not statistically analyzed due to the small size of the population, in Usiai groups, where botanical knowledge levels were higher, knowledge levels were found to be also higher when both parents belonged to Usiai families. 2.3.3. Island interior versus coastal living (H o2) For all four categories (plants recognized, identified, used, or used medicinally) there were no significant differences ( =0.10) between those living on the coast and those living in the interior of the province. The results emphasize the convergence of cultural subclasses among the Manus. In general it was observed that all groups on Manus live relatively close to the coast, as boats offer the easiest access to the town. 38 For analysis of this hypothesis, coastal living was defined as living on the immediate coast (less than 30 meters). The lack of significant differences between the knowledge among the two localities, paired with the significant differences in knowledge levels among different cultural groups, substantiates the theory that cultural differences play a larger role in the transfer and maintenance of indigenous knowledge than simple geographical distance. 2.3.4. Age groups (H o3) Analysis of variance between plant knowledge categories and informant age groups indicated that the youngest informants (18-30) had the lowest levels of knowledge in all categories. However, analyses were only found to be statistically significant in the categories of plants recognized ( P=0.021) and plants identified ( P=0.019). These findings are consistent with the findings of other quantitative ethnobotanical studies (Caniago and Siebert, 1998; Luoga, et al., 2000; Phillips and Gentry, 1993b). Differences in knowledge levels were found to be significant only in the categories of plants recognized between informant age groups 18- 30 and 41-50, as well as plants identified between age group 18-30 and age groups, 31-40, 41-50, and >60 (Figure 4). 39 Figure 4. Comparison of plant knowledge among informant age groups. Columns represent the percentage of plants cited by informants of that age group for each knowledge category. Significantly different groups (a=0.10) are marked with asterisks; P-values are analyzed using (SAS)-based ANOVA for unequal sample sizes. It is important to note that the informant age group that identified the most plants was aged between 41-50. This may highlight one of the caveats to the ethnobotanical notebook strategy of ethnopharmacological interviews, i.e, that older generations are less comfortable looking at printed images than younger generations. Older members of the community may rely on additional senses to identify plants, such as taste and smell, or may have visual defects such as cataracts, that may limit their ability to recognize plants using an ethnobotanical notebook. For example, one interview with a person over the age of 60 was stopped 40 after it became apparent that he was unable to work with the ethnobotanical notebook. A similar phenomenon was found amongst the Caicara, of Camburi beach, Brazil, where levels of plant utility knowledge were found to be higher in younger groups of the population as compared to the elderly (Hanazaki, et al., 2000). No significant differences ( =0.10) were found in the categories of plant usage and medicinal plant usage. One possible explanation for this is that by the age of 18-30 the Manus have acquired a foundation of plant knowledge for all uses including medicine. At the same time, the knowledge of plant names is not being passed on as efficiently. This could be a result of linguistic groups merging through marriage and cohabitation. When family members speak different indigenous languages, it may be very difficult to pass on common names that do not translate between different family members' languages. 2.3.5. Gender (H o4) Formal analysis of gender knowledge levels indicated that men identified significantly higher percentages of plant names ( P=0.069) and uses ( P=0.008) than women, though the numbers of plants recognized or identified as medicinally used were not significantly different (=0.10)(Figure 5). 41 Figure 5. Comparison of plant knowledge between male and female informants. Columns represent the percentage of plants cited by informants of that gender for each knowledge category. Significantly different groups are marked with asterisks; P-values were derived from Satterthwaite t-test (SAS) for unequal sample sizes with unequal variances (Satterthwaite, 1946). Previous studies have also found that the number of plants cited with uses by male informants to be higher than those mentioned by women in other indigenous populations in Brazil, Peru and Burkina Faso (Hanazaki, et al., 2000; Kristensen and Balslev, 2003; Stagegaard, et al., 2002). The gender difference among the Manus may lie in the interpretation of the interview process. It has been suggested by Johns and Weiss that often informants will give a positive response to questions 42 in order to impress the interviewer and appear knowledgeable (Johns, et al., 1990; Weiss, 1979). One must note that the interviewer was a tall, white, male from the US, a country that has been documented to be revered by the local community (Mead, 1968). Men, in general, responded to the interviewer with a greater need to impress, while women often acted to expedite the interview process, slightly uncomfortable with the intimate nature of the interviews with a male foreigner (Mead, 1968). Occasionally, it was observed during the interview process with male informants that names would be given repeatedly for different plants. When this was pointed out by the interviewer, interviewees would usually claim that it was a different type of the same named plant. This observation was never made with female interviewees. 2.3.6. Distance from Lorengau Town (H o5 and H o6) Null hypotheses five and six were tested in an attempt to quantify the acculturation process on a local level. Lorengau town represents the political, economic and social capital of the province. It is significantly more developed than villages among Manus, and its inhabitants show observable differences from the Manus living in villages, such as Pere, Bundrahi and Ndrehet. Hypothesis five compared the plant knowledge among those in villages versus those living in Lorengau town without consideration of the distance between villages and Lorengau, while 43 hypothesis six assessed the correlation between distance from interviewees' homes and Lorengau town, recognizing that any distance away from Lorengau town presumes village life. The results of formal analysis show that people in villages could recognize ( P=0.004) and identify ( P=0.008) significantly more plants than those living in Lorengau town (Figure 6A). Villagers also identified more useful plants than those living in town, but the difference was not statistically significant ( =0.10). There was no significant difference between the percentage of medicinal plants identified by villagers versus those living in town ( =0.10). Linear regression between the percentage of plants recognized, identified and identified as useful were all found to have statistically significant relationships (Figure 6B) with knowledge increasing with the distance an informant lived from the town. Similar findings were reported among the Yuracare-Trinitario of Bolivia (Vandebroek, et al., 2004). The level of acculturation in Lorengau town is significantly greater than in villages. 44 Figure 6. A.) Comparison of plant knowledge between informants living in Lorengau town versus informants living in villages. Columns represent the percentage of plants cited by informants that live in villages versus those living in Lorengau town for each knowledge category. Significantly different groups are marked with asterisks; P-values were derived from Satterthwaite t-test (SAS) for unequal sample sizes with unequal variances (Satterthwaite, 1946). B.) Linear regression of plants recognized, identified and used based on the distance (km) of informants' homes from Lorengau town. 45 However, in hypothesis H o5, medicinal plant usage did not have a statistically significant difference. As cited in previous studies, traditional medicine practices are particularly vulnerable to loss (Lewis and Elvin-Lewis, 1994; Phillips and Gentry, 1993b). Since the Manus have been subjected to Western cultures for nearly a century, the data from hypotheses H o5 and H o6 indicate that, while other ethnobotanical knowledge is being lost slowly, medicinal plant knowledge has been disappearing rapidly over an extensive period of acculturation. Villagers on the opposite side of Manus Island from Lorengau town (Figure 2) have lost nearly all knowledge of medicinal plants, showing no significant proficiency over those in town. Work on the medical anthropology of the Manus in the late 1960s reported similar findings, citing that the two systems of medicine (traditional and Western) actively compete (Romanucci-Schwartz, 1969). Nearly 35 years later, there is an extremely limited level of medicinal plant knowledge present in the province, while knowledge of plant names and general uses remains. The data support the argument that medicinal plant knowledge is particularly vulnerable to loss. 2.4. C ONCLUSIONS When combined, statistical analysis of plant knowledge of informant groups determined by physical, geographical and social factors among the Manus led to conclusions that Usiai men living in villages far 46 from Lorengau town have the highest attainment of plant knowledge within Manus Province. The current study has shown that, even on the provincial level, significant cultural convergence and blending of idiosyncratic cultures has occurred. Findings indicate that medicinal plant knowledge is particularly vulnerable to loss during the acculturation process, based on the low levels of medicinal plant knowledge present among the Manus and the lack of significant differences among medicinal plant knowledge of all of the informant groups compared. It appears that medicinal plant usage is being replaced with modern pharmaceuticals even though Western medicine is rarely available. This byproduct of the acculturation process among the Manus is a dangerous combination and has the potential to leave numerous indigenous inhabitants without ample medical care. The Manus are only one example of an indigenous group that has lost significant medicinal plant knowledge; and it is reasonable to speculate that globalization with these repercussions is occurring in numerous locations of similar circumstance. Without significant efforts, the diversity of countless cultures will disappear just as the medicinal plant knowledge of the Manus has. 47 3. EVALUATION OF ANTI-TB MEDICINAL PLANTS FROM MANUS ISLAND 3.1. INTRODUCTION 3.1.1. Evaluating ethnobotanicals One of the greatest challenges in the fields of pharmacognosy and ethnobotany is their interdisciplinary nature. A key element of success in such a widely diverse science is the communication between scientists from different disciplines involved. In the specific sphere of ethnopharmacology with an application to modern health discoveries (both pharmaceutical and herbal), many have found it difficult to establish direct collaborative communication between social scientists and laboratory scientists, due to the bulk of their disciplines being unrelated. While there are limited exceptions (Ankli, et al., 2002; Munoz, et al., 2000; Valentin, et al., 2000), the literature on ethnopharmacological studies, with goals of its application to modern health care, is clearly divided between two informal standards of research: (i) the anthropological survey, documenting plants used for certain illnesses based on fieldwork with indigenous populations and drawing conclusions based on predictive models of analysis (Ali-Shtayeh, et al., 2000; Leaman, et al., 1995; Schlage, et al., 2000); and (ii) the 48 biological/chemical laboratory analysis of previously documented ethnopharmacological data (Freiburghaus, et al., 1996; Newton, et al., 2002; Nick, et al., 1995). It has been claimed that a closer connection between anthropological and biochemical research would greatly improve the field of ethnopharmacology (Etkin, 2001; Farnsworth, 1994), and while there are research groups that cover both aspects of the ethnopharmacological research process (Ankli, et al., 2002; Ankli, et al., 1999; Heinrich, et al., 1998), few studies have confronted the issue of the validity of utilizing these models to assign pharmaceutical potential (Johns, et al., 1995; Johns, et al., 1990; Trotter and Logan, 1986). 3.1.2. The Informant consensus model Several different ways of quantitatively analyzing ethnobotanical data have been utilized over the last 20 years. While they each attempt to rank species based on informant responses, the strategies and formulae involved vary greatly. The Informant Agreement Ratio (IAR), or Informant Consensus Factor (F ic), paired with relative frequency (RF) data was chosen based on its application to the ethnobotanical notebook interview strategy and because it most clearly defines consensus among informants by comparing the number of times a plant is mentioned for a specific ailment to the number of times that ailment is mentioned in the interview processes (Heinrich, et al., 1998; Trotter and Logan, 1986). 49 Other models, such as the Fidelity level (FL), set a comparison of the number of times a plant is mentioned for a specific ailment with the number of times that plant is mentioned in the interview process (Friedman, et al., 1986). Using the ethnobotanical notebook strategy, all species are deliberately mentioned the same number of times, therefore, the FL comparison method is irrelevant. An additional caveat to this method is that species with a high RF for more than one specific disease would receive a low FL score. In the current study the IAR and F ic are recognized as identical calculations since the number of use reports is equal to the number of informants for each plant, again, as a result of the ethnobotanical notebook strategy (Heinrich, et al., 1998). A comparison of various IAR values reported in the literature to date span the range from 0 to 1 (the theoretical minimum and maximum, respectively). Other quantitative studies have spanned a significantly greater diversity of medical categories. Due to the nature of this project, biological testing within the present study was limited to medicinal inquiries of TB related ailments. Originally proposed by Trotter and Logan (1986), the IAR and relative frequencies of species which interviewers mentioned were tested for unspecific biological activity using a brine shrimp assay (Trotter and Logan, 1986). More specifically, Johns et al. studied the anti-giardial activity of traditional medicines against gastrointestinal ailments in East Africa, and concluded that there was no correlation between biological 50 activity and the log linear model proposed by the group in 1990 (Johns, et al., 1995; Johns, et al., 1990). Despite these results, similar models continue to be used (Ali-Shtayeh, et al., 2000; Schlage, et al., 2000; Tabuti, et al., 2003). In 2003, a minor study that included only 8 plants showed a slight correlation between the frequency of a plant in ethnobotanical interviews with the size of antibacterial inhibition halos (Hernandez, et al., 2003). By directly comparing the predictive models used by anthropological ethnobotanists, such as the informant consensus model, with biological activity data, we can begin to assess the validity of these models. Since few anthropologists have the resources to test disease-relevant biological activity, and few pharmacognosists perform ethnobotanical fieldwork, it is no surprise that only a single previous assessment of this model has been carried out (Johns, et al., 1995). 3.1.3. Tuberculosis in Papua New Guinea In 1966, it was estimated that one in forty persons on Manus Island was being treated for TB (Romanucci-Schwartz, 1969). At the time, the Manus relied on herbal and traditional treatments for TB, and when a cure could not be provided in this manner, patients, on the verge of death, were hospitalized. A majority of these patients died in the hospital or were deemed incurable on their arrival. As a result, European medicine was interpreted as ineffective (Romanucci-Schwartz, 51 1969). This led to a rise in traditional medicine, deemed a counter- acculturation process (Landy, 1977; Romanucci-Schwartz, 1969). It is of interest to note that within the nation of Papua New Guinea, TB is the fourth highest cause of death, accounting for 10% of all deaths and, at 27%, is the most common cause of admission into hospitals (Naraqi, et al., 2003; WHO, 2002a). In Manus, however, TB is not present in the list of the top ten leading causes of mortality, accounting for less than 1% of deaths in the province (WHO, 2000). 3.1.4. Hypothesis and rationale of study As part of a larger initiative to identify effective herbals and inexpensive treatments for TB, the current project sought to assess the validity of using informant consensus models for predicting biological activity, through an ethnopharmacological study of plants used for symptoms of tuberculosis TB on Manus Island. In addition, the biological evaluation of Manus ethnobotanicals allows selection of the most promising plant for in-depth phytochemical analysis as noted in the subsequent chapter. 3.2. M ETHODOLOGY 3.2.1. Additional interviews In addition to the ethnobotanical notebook inquiries discussed in the previous chapter, interviewees were subsequently asked about plants 52 that they used for respiratory illnesses that were not found within the ethnobotanical notebook. If an interviewee knew additional species for treating respiratory ailments, they would lead the interviewer to the plant so that collections could be made. Analysis for the purpose of this study was restricted to data for which species could be successfully collected and exported to the United States, so that all informant data had supplemental biological data. Each interview lasted approximately 60 minutes. 3.2.2. Bulk plant collection, drying, processing As noted above, plants were identified with the assistance of Professor Pius Piskaut from the University of Papua New Guinea. Once plants were identified, they were assessed for their local abundance and verified for their presence in the CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) lists of threatened species, as well as in the USDA's list of restricted materials for importation. At the time of collection, data including but not limited to GPS coordinates, collection number, common name, plant characteristics, etc. were recorded (Daly and Beck, 1996). Plants that were not threatened and were identified as used against relevant ailments were collected in mesh bags in the quantity of approximately 1 kg (Soejarto, 1993). The plants were then air- dried, chopped with a machete into small pieces (ca. 1 square inch) and packed into small cotton bags and tightened with drawstrings. Plant 53 collections were inspected by the Papua New Guinean Ministry of Agriculture and shipped to the US with the appropriate permits and documentation as required by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) regulations (Section 122.2 of Title 9, CFR). After plants had been successfully imported into the US and arrived at UIC, they were milled into a fine powder at the UIC field station and placed into one-gallon Ziploc bags. 3.2.3. Micro-extraction To maximize efficiency, a micro-extraction procedure developed by the author was utilized for the preparation of crude plant extracts for biological testing. A minimal amount (~500 mg) of dried, ground plant material sufficient to generate ample extract for initial biological testing was placed in cotton plugged Pasteur pipettes. An aliquot (1.5 ml) of dichloromethane was poured through the pipettes into tared 1.5 ml microvials. The extracts were dried in a Savant Speedvac centrifugal condenser, and matched with the original plant-material containing pipette. The procedure was then repeated using methanol. This was done to maximize the polarity of the extraction, for preliminary testing. Extracts were weighed and then dissolved in DMSO and serially diluted for in vitro biological testing. 54 3.2.4. Assays (TB and cytotoxicity) All biological data were provided by Drs. Scott Franzblau and Yuehong Wang of UIC's Institute for Tuberculosis Research (ITR). Biological testing paired in vitro activity against M. tuberculosis with mammalian cell cytotoxicity against VERO cells to determine selectivity. Anti-tubercular activity was evaluated in a Microplate Alamar Blue Assay (MABA) using virulent strains of M. tuberculosis (H37R v) (Collins and Franzblau, 1997; Franzblau, et al., 1998). In MABA, the minimum concentration of a sample that inhibits mycobacterial growth by 90% (MIC) relative to solvent control is equivalent to an MIC 99 determined in the BACTEC system (Collins and Franzblau, 1997; Franzblau, et al., 1998). Since crude plant extracts often have large MICs (greater than 100 \u00b5g/ml), concentrations that inhibited growth by 50% (IC 50TB), as well as the percent inhibition of drug-sensitive M. tuberculosis H37R v (ATCC 27294) at the concentration of 128 \u00b5g/ml, were also determined. Rifampin was used as a positive control. Cytotoxic effects were concurrently determined using VERO cells (tested to the maximum of 160 \u00b5g/ml) (Cantrell, et al., 1996). The IC 50VERO values were calculated for each extract and compared to the MIC in the anti-mycobacterial assay. Typical selectivity index is calculated as the IC 50VERO over anti-TB MIC values. Since this is usually applied to potent individual compounds, a modified selectivity index utilizing IC 50 values for both 55 VERO cells and H37R v M. tuberculosis cells, was established to prioritize crude plant extracts as therapeutic agents. This was calculated as: With IC 50TB and IC 50VERO values between 1 and 100 \u00b5g/ml, the equation produces an SI value between 2 and -2. The greater the SI value the more selective the plant extract is towards inhibiting M. tuberculosis growth versus inhibiting mammalian cell growth (general cytotoxicity). Therefore, a plant with a positive SI value closer to 2 may have potential as an herbal medicine to be used for TB, while a plant with a negative SI possesses more general cytotoxicity than specific M. tuberculosis in vitro inhibition, and receives low priority for follow-up. For species with IC 50 and MIC values greater than the highest concentration tested (160 \u00b5g/ml) MIC and IC 50 values were calculated based on extrapolation of the bioactivity curves. 3.2.5. Hypotheses and statistical analysis Information on plants used for different respiratory ailments were grouped into eight categories, based on the terms given by the interviewees: TB, asthma, short wind, asthma/short wind, cough, panacea, total respiratory ailments inclusive of panaceas, and total respiratory ailments without panaceas. A plant was deemed a panacea if a single interviewee reported its use for a respiratory ailment plus three IC 50 VERO cells IC50 M. tuberculosis SI= log 56 or more other unrelated illnesses. The Informant Agreement Ratio (IAR) was calculated for each condition, as well as total respiratory illnesses based on the methods developed by Trotter and Logan in 1986 [also called Informants' Consensus Factor (F ic) (Heinrich, et al., 1998; Trotter and Logan, 1986)]: IAR = This formula is based on the model that consensus among informants predicts a higher potential for bioactivity in ethnomedical research. IAR scores range from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating that every time an illness was mentioned, interviewees would cite the same plant to treat it. The relative frequency (RF) of each plant from the interviews was calculated to determine a \"remedy of choice\". Being named by three informants is the most common cut-off point used by ethnobotanical researchers to establish consensus (Ali-Shtayeh, et al., 2000; Camejo- Rodrigues, et al., 2003; Johns, et al., 1990; Legrand and Wondergem, 1987), though other groups have used four (Ankli, et al., 1999).or five (Schlage, et al., 2000).citations from different informants. To test the relationship between the informant consensus model and biological activity the following null hypotheses were postulated and analyzed: (Total Cases for Ailment) - (Number of Separate Remedies for Ailment) (Total Cases for Ailment) - 1 57 Ho1 - There is no difference between the mean selectivity index (SI) or IC50TB of species with RF values 3 versus species with RF<3. Ho2 - Plant relative frequency from ethnobotanical interviews is related to anti-TB selectivity (SI) and inversely related to IC 50TB (against M. tuberculosis ) values. Ho3 - There is no difference between the mean SI or IC 50TB of species specifically noted for use against TB versus species noted for use against all respiratory symptoms. Ho4 - There is no difference between the mean anti-TB SI or IC 50TB values for species noted for use against all respiratory symptoms and those collected without ethnobotanical data. Hypotheses were tested using SAS software (SAS Institute, Inc., 2001, Cary, NC) for simple t-tests and linear regression analysis. The mean IC 50TB and SI were also calculated for informant agreement ratios for each category of respiratory ailments. 3.2.6. Priority ranking and sample extraction Following the evaluation of the in vitro anti-TB and selectivity results for ethnobotanically collected plants, the top six ranking plants were chosen based on the highest rankings for IC 50TB and MIC. Plants were ranked based on their IC 50TB and MIC independently. Then these two sets of rankings were averaged together and the top 6 plants were 58 prioritized for future investigation. Three subsequent extracts of each of the prioritized plants were made for non-polar constituents, polar constituents, and alkaloid constituents. Plant samples (ca. 20 g) were placed in 125 ml separation funnels with cotton plugs above the stopcocks. Aliquots of dichloromethane (50 ml) were poured into plant material and allowed to sit for a minimum of 30 minutes. Then vacuum pressure was applied to remove the solvent. This was repeated 3 times. Non-polar extracts were condensed on a Buchi 011 rotary evaporator and transferred to vials for weighing and storage. The remaining plant material was then extracted in the same manner with methanol and repeated 5 times. The third set of extracts was made with 50 ml aliquots of 1% HCl in water and repeated 3 times. These aqueous extracts were transferred to clean 250 ml separation funnels, and base (KOH) was titrated into the extracts until they were of neutral pH. They were then partitioned with chloroform (100 ml) three times. The alkaloid- containing lower phases were condensed on a Buchi 011 rotary evaporator and transferred to vials for weighing and storage. A 1 mg sample of each extract was submitted to in vitro M. tuberculosis H37R v biological assay and tested as stated above. While it is now clear that a milder acid, such as tartaric acid, would have been a more suitable choice to form the alkaloidal salts, this extraction and prioritization step had occurred before, this knowledge was obtained. 59 3.3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 3.3.1. Interview and IAR results Interviews conducted on Manus Island provided 102 use-reports of TB-related ailments based on persistent respiratory symptoms, among 45 interviewees. Of these 102 use-reports, 88 accounted for species that were found and collected. Of the 105 plants presented in the ethnobotanical notebook (see chapter 2, section 2.2.3), 28 were found to be used for treatment of a persistent respiratory ailment. From the semi-structured, ailment-specific inquiries, 15 additional species were cited as therapeutic plants. IAR values ranged from 0 to 0.5 among the eight categories of respiratory illnesses (Table 3). As shown in Table 3, the mean IC 50 against virulent M. tuberculosis , and SI values specifically for the TB category (designated by a description of symptoms that are specific to pulmonary TB) were not higher than those species cited in the categories for other persistent respiratory conditions. The highest IAR value was determined for species cited for all uses inclusive of panaceas. This indicates that the same species were being mentioned by informants for different persistent respiratory conditions, but when analyzed as a combined condition there was higher informant agreement. This is easy to understand, as it is common that medicinal plant usage and traditional medicine are typically passed through generations as oral tradition. As this occurred, there may have been slight alterations of 60 details between different specific ailments, but the overall medicinal plant categories of usage remained constant. At the individual plant level, nine out of the 43 plants collected with ethnopharmacological data on TB-related ailments had three or more informants citing the same use for each species (Relative Frequency 3). These species are ranked according to their RF values (Table 4) and would be the top priority species for potential biological testing if this model was utilized as a method of prediction. Full results of RF analysis for the categories found in Table 3 are found in Table 5. 61 Table 3.

Activity reported from plants Eleven of the 43 species were found to have an IC 50TB less than 50 \u00b5g/ml (Table 6), two of which had MICs less than 100 \u00b5g/ml. Twelve of the species had selectivity indices greater than 0.5 on a scale from 2 to -2. These data support the theory that several of the species identified in the traditional pharmacopoeia of Manus Island may have potential as an herbal treatment to supplement modern drug regimens, though it is evident that modern drug regimens for TB are rarely available to the Manus. Based on th e SI equation used, a value of SI = 0.5 translates to anti-mycobacterial activity three times more potent than mammalian cell toxicity. Only six of the 43 species tested had an SI value less than 0, translating to a plant with more toxicity than anti- mycobacterial activity. Mean selectivity indices of species with RF values greater than or equal to 3 were calculated to be 0.31 versus 0.39 for those with RF values less than 3. The difference in mean SI between species with RF values greater than or equal to 3 versus those with RF values less than 3, however, was not found to be significant ( P value 0.50). No significant difference was found between species with RF values greater than or equal to 3 and those with smaller RF values based on IC 50TB values ( P value 0.43). In fact those with lower RF values had a lower (better) mean IC 50TB value (83 \u00b5g/ml versus 108 \u00b5g/ml). Additionally, through linear regression ( Ho2), there was no significant 65 relationship between RF and the values for either IC 50TB or SI ( P values of 0.21 and 0.15, respectively). The data consistently contested the relationship between relative frequency of a plant being mentioned by informants and in vitro anti-mycobacterial activity. When comparing the anti-mycobacterial activity of species specifically noted in the treatment of TB and those used for any of the persistent respiratory illness categories, analysis of the data could not identify a significant difference between the two groups. While the mean SI value for species specifically mentioned for the treatment of TB were higher than those for species that were mentioned for other respiratory ailments, IC 50TB values were actually higher (worse) for species specifically mentioned for TB as compared to those mentioned for other respiratory ailments (SI values 0.46 and 0.34, TB IC 50TB values 72 and 96 \u00b5g/ml). This indicates that species claimed to be used specifically for TB had more potent general cytotoxicity than those cited for other respiratory ailments. Neither set of data (SI or IC 50TB) were found to have significant differences between plants specifically noted in the treatment of TB and those used for any of the persistent respiratory illness categories ( P values of 0.23 and 0.29, respectively). 66 Table 6.

These \"randomly\" collected plants, collected based on a biodiversity approach to maximize taxonomic diversity, were micro-extracted with the same methods as the ethnobotanically collected plants and tested for anti-mycobacterial activity, as well as cytotoxicity. The results are shown in Table 6. The mean selectivity indices of species collected ethnobotanically were calculated as 0.30, identical to those collected without ethnobotanical data. The difference in mean SI between plants collected ethnobotanically and those collected without ethnobotanical data, therefore, was not found to be significant ( P value 0.95). Additionally, no significant difference in IC 50TB values was found between plants collected ethnobotanically over those collected without ethnobotanical data ( P value 0.54), however, those collected without ethnobotanical data had a lower (better) mean IC 50TB value (105 \u00b5g/ml versus 130 \u00b5g/ml). This means, however, that ethnobotanically collected plants had less mean cytotoxicity than those plants collected without ethnobotanical data (163 \u00b5g/ml versus 120 \u00b5g/ml), which, unlike the other two analyses, was found to be significantly different ( P value 0.0018). 69 Table 7.

Plant selected for phytochemical work-up As shown in Table 8, three plant extracts -- Casuarina equisetifolia, Mallotus philippensis, and Dracaena angustifolia -- had significantly high inhibition of M. tuberculosis . Evaluation of the literature through NAPRAlert and Scifinder Scholar searches indicated that C. equisetifolia and M. philippensis had thorough phytochemical investigations previously carried out. D. angustifolia , however, had minimal previous phytochemical research in the literature. Since phytochemical investigations were ideally focused on identifying novel active compounds D. angustifolia was prioritized for phytochemical follow-up. Table 8.

Discussion While the current study has indicated that informant consensus among the Manus for persistent respiratory symptoms is not a competent prediction model for anti-mycobacterial activity, the data must be understood as a preliminary exploration. In this respect, a broader study covering identical illness categories among different cultural groups and ranging IAR values would need to be performed to draw concise, final conclusions. One explanation for the lack of significance of the informant consensus prediction model in the current study could be due to the lack or loss of specific ethnopharmacological knowledge among the people of Manus Island. Other studies have concluded that traditional medicinal practices are among the most vulnerable to loss in the modernization and acculturation process (Lewis and Elvin-Lewis, 1994; Phillips and Gentry, 1993b). Since the beginning of the twentieth century, Manus Province has suffered severe acculturation, both in the form of colonists and soldiers (Mead, 1968). Formal anthropological studies dating from the 1920s to the 1970s indicate that Manus has been formally converted to Western culture, citing that \"one is struck by the Manus desire for total acculturation to the European-American life style\" (Romanucci- Schwartz, 1969). Remarkably, however, Romanucci-Ross reports of witnessing the counter-acculturative process among the Manus, who resort back to traditional medicines as Western medicines failed to treat 73 illnesses (Romanucci-Schwartz, 1969). This is common occurrence in the treatment of TB, since relatively expensive, multiple drug regimens are rarely available. Despite reports on the underlying continuance of traditional medicine in the Manus, the current study found that the use of traditional herbals had continued to fade following the trend previously reported (Romanucci-Schwartz, 1969). Throughout the province, herbal healers have disappeared as an occupation within local culture. Aid-posts and reliance on hospitals have greatly reduced the use of herbal medicine. With the disappearance of recognized herbalists among the people of Manus province, medicinal plant usage has been reduced to an individual family level of diagnosis and treatment. When pharmaceuticals are not available, as is often the case, medicinal plants are used based on knowledge among family members and close friends. In contrast to numerous other indigenous populations of the world that have a greater reliance on herbal medicine, plants are viewed by the Manus as natural pharmaceuticals, devoid of the requirements of spiritual or preparatory customs to invoke effectiveness. As was discovered through in depth interviews and cultural observations, medicinal plant use in Manus Province shares the Western assumptions that effectiveness is based solely on accurate plant selection and physical preparations of the remedy. While it was observed that the model of healthcare on Manus Island was seemingly westernized, relating diseases to pathogens and medicine to physical elements versus spiritual 74 elements, as is seen in other isolated indigenous cultures, the context of terms in use among Manusians may be very different from Western bioscience. For example, while informants were completely comfortable with the term \"TB\", their understanding of the word may still function in an alien context with persistent traditional attributes of being associated with spiritual health versus being specifically related to a Mycobacterium species (Landy, 1977; Lieban, 1967). These cultural-translation difficulties may explain the lack of biological activity data to species with high relative frequency values. For these same reasons, ethnobotanically collected plants did not demonstrate greater biological activity. In previous studies in areas where herbal practitioners remain prominent, ethnobotanically collected plants have shown greater bioactivity than plants collected randomly. Such was the case in a direct comparison study of the two collection methods in Sinai (Khafagi and Dewedar, 2000). Other prominent ethnobotanists have drawn similar conclusions (Balick, 1990; Cox and Balick, 1994) A major caveat to relating biological activity with indigenous knowledge lies in the biological element of the current project. Ideally, ethnopharmacological study should be validated through documented use of plants before and after treatment (Friedman, et al., 1986). This method is, however, extremely difficult to execute due to the timing involved in witnessing and authenticating ethnobotanically treated 75 patients in isolated areas. In vitro assays utilizing relevant pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37R v for anti-TB evaluation represent the most feasible method to determine the underlying biological activity of traditional medicines. Due to the complexity of the human body, it cannot be assumed that in vitro bioassay results translate to human systems, namely, clinical activity, for either a positive or negative result. Consequently, the plant species identified in the survey may be beneficial in the treatment of TB for many reasons apart from direct anti-mycobacterial activity; e.g., they may provide symptomatic relief from cough or have immunostimulatory effects. It must also be noted that the in vitro test may not be predictive of activity in vivo . With infinite resources, samples could be submitted to other relevant assays such as immune-modulating assays to better understand and assess the biological activity of traditional medicine. 3.4. C ONCLUSIONS Through intensive interviews among indigenous informants and subsequent biological testing in a relevant anti-TB in vitro assay, it has been shown that the model of informant consensus, which would predict that, if a species has higher relative frequency of mention for a specific illness, the greater the potential for containing pharmacologically active constituents, is inaccurate for anti-mycobacterial activity in the TB- related ethnopharmacological pharmacopoeia of Manus Island. 76 Ethnopharmacologists should, therefore, take into consideration the conclusion from the present study in future studies in their use of the informant consensus model and recognize the level of assumption that coincides with conclusions based thereon. To date there are no examples of significant studies where a higher relative frequency value of a species among ethnopharmacological interviews has correlated with specific biological activity. More comprehensive studies would continue to clarify the strength or incompatibility of this method of ethnopharmacological analysis. As a secondary result of the biological evaluation of ethnobotanically collected plants used among the Manus for persistent respiratory symptoms, Dracaena angustifolia Roxb. (Dracaenaceae) was for phytochemical follow-up based on its selective anti- mycobacterial activity and the lack of previous phytochemical reports on the species. 77 4. ANTI-TB PHYTOCHEMISTRY OF DRACAENA ANGUSTIFOLIA ROXB. 4.1. BACKGROUND 4.1.1. Common names Despite the Manus having numerous indigenous languages resulting in numerous local names for Dracaena angustifolia Roxb., the plant is most commonly recognized as Ciai throughout the province. Around the world, D. angustifolia has other common names such as Nam Ginseng, meaning ginseng from the south, in Southeast Asia, Charlang in India, and Tidba, used by the Jarawa islanders of the bay of Bengal (Jain, 1991; Mukhopadhyay, et al., 2002; Tran, et al., 2001). Nam ginseng is the most common term used for D. angustifolia in the literature due to previous phytochemical studies undertaken in Vietnam, even though the plant is not a true ginseng (member of Panax , Araliaceae). It has been associated with the Panax species due to its similar traditional medicinal uses among the Vietnamese, particularly P. vietnamensis , also referred to as Vietnam ginseng (Banskota, et al., 2003; Tran, et al., 2001). D. angustifolia can usually be found in forests and thickets throughout southeastern Asia, the south Pacific and northern Australia (Eflora.org, 2000). 79 1.5 to 5.5 cm wide. They exhibit parallel venation with the base almost completely covering the internode Small greenish white flowers are arranged in cylindrical clusters of two or three at the terminal end of the branches. The perianth is light green, 1.9 to 2.3 cm, forming a tube seven to eight millimeters and lobes 1.1 to 1.6 cm. The length of an anther is two to three millimeters long. The globular fruits are reddish-orange in color and 10 to 15 cm in diameter with one or two seeds (RC0042 Voucher specimen). Kingdom uses Dracaena angustifolia or Nam ginseng has several traditional uses, including use for the treatment of various physical ailments. The Khasi and Garo Tribes of Meghalaya, in northeastern India, use decoctions of the leaves and roots to treat various ailments including the common 80 cold, malaria, rheumatoid arthritis, and kidney troubles (Maikhuri and Gangwar, 1993). Jain notes that traditional Indian folk medicine uses Charlang to treat inflammation and swelling of the joints (Jain, 1991). The Jarawa women, a small indigenous tribe residing in the southern and middle Andaman Islands in the Bay of Bengal, strip the bark off and use the twigs of D. angustifolia to clean their genitals after menstruation (Mukhopadhyay, et al., 2002) Outside of India, Nam ginseng is also used to treat an assortment of illnesses. In Vietnam, the underground parts are boiled and used as a tonic to treat leukemia. Similar to other true ginsengs, the roots and rhizomes are used as a tonic to increase mental efficiency, physical balance, and metabolic functions (Tran, et al., 2001). The leaves are also used in Vietnam to treat diarrhea, while a decoction of the dried seeds is used for asthma (Banskota, et al., 2003). 4.1.3.1. Additional ethnobotanical usage In addition to its medicinal uses, D. angustifolia is also used throughout India in religious ceremonies, as well as to build mats and bed sheets by the Jarawa (Jain, 1991; Mukhopadhyay, et al., 2002). The flowers are also eaten in Vietnam (Banskota, et al., 2003; Tran, et al., 2001). 81 4.1.4. Pharmacognosy 4.1.4.1. Chemistry There is limited phytochemical literature on D. angustifolia , with only one published phytochemical stud y. Tran et al. (2001) examined the methanolic extract of the roots and rhizomes of D. angustifolia and identified nine new compounds, F). Additionally, they isolated eight known steroidal saponins (see Figure 8). The nine compounds were isolated by Diaion HP-20 and ODS column chromatography, and PTLC (Tran, et al., 2001). These data were later published in a mini-review of Vietnamese medicinal plants (Banskota, et al., 2003). 82 Figure 8. Compounds previously isolated from D. angustifolia modified from (Tran, activity Tran et al. (2001) tested all of the isolated compounds for antiproliferative activity against human HT-1080 fibrosarcoma, murine colon 26-L5 carcinoma, and B-16 BL6 lines. The results indicated that the spirostanol saponins were more potent cytotoxic agents than their furostanol saponine counterparts. The acetyl group in the sugar moiety appear to play a crucial role for activity. Four of the tested compounds, namonin A and B, along with two of the known spirostanol steroids ( T-4, T-5, T-10, activity against HT-1080 fibrosarcoma. However, the same compounds exhibited only mild activity against murine colon 26-L5 carcinoma and B-16 BL6 melanoma cell lines. Similarly, slight activity was evident for namonins C-E, along with three of the previously identified T-6-8, T-12, T-15, and T-16) against HT-1080 fibrosarcoma, all of which share the common characteristics of having 24-O-fucopyranosol and xylopyranosol units. Interestingly, spirostanol T-13 showed murine colon 26-L5 melanoma, despite its lack of fucopyranosyl, xylopyranosyl, and acetyl residues. The remaining compounds were inactive against all cell lines (Banskota, et al., 2003; Tran, et al., 2001). Sundarrao et al. (1993) tested the dried leaves of D. angustifolia from Papua New Guinea for antibacterial activity, specifically against Bacillus subtilis extract of Nam Ginseng was tested on an agar plate with concentrations of 2 to 3 \u00b5g per plate and found to be inactive against all test bacteria (Sundarro, 1993). Aswal et al. (1984) tested the dried aerial parts of D. angustifolia from India for antispasmodic, antitumor, and toxicity activity. The unspecific antispasmodic activity of D. angustifolia was tested in vivo in a guinea pig using a EtOH-H 20 (1:1) extract, and was found to be active in the ileum to acetylcholine-induced contractions. Antitumor activity was tested in mice with LEUK-P388 at a dosage was 95.0 mg/kg, but the extract was found to be inactive. D. angustifolia also underwent an in vivo toxicity assessment, using a mouse model. The IC 50 was recorded as 383.0 mg/kg (Aswal, et al., 1984). 4.2. METHODS In addition to testing the major hypothesis of the current study by isolating and identifying active anti-mycobacterial compounds, an additional objective of the Anti-TB phytochemical analysis of D. angustifolia was to develop and apply novel methodology in the process. The typical means to isolate and identify biologically active compounds from natural sources is referred to as Bioassay-Guided Fractionation (BGF). This methodological suite involves alternating chromatographic fractionation of extracts and in vitro biological testing against a biological 85 target such as the TB pathogen for which isolates are sought. While several of the methods described below are common throughout the field of natural product chemistry and BGF, some have been developed in conjunction with the current project. These methods take advantage of new technologies and combinations of technologies that deserve increased attention due to their efficiency and environmental benefits, and are discussed in detail in section 4.3. 4.2.1. Isolation 4.2.1.1. Solvents All solvents used throughout the extraction and analysis of D. angustifolia were HPLC grade. They were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. (Milwaukee, WI) and Fischer Scientific Co. (Pittsburgh, PA). All waste solvents were properly disposed of in accordance to UIC OHSA regulations dictated by the US Environmental Protection Agency. 4.2.1.2. Plant extraction Based on the secondary screening of bioactivity-prioritized plant material, it was concluded that a dichloromethane extract would be suitable to identify the anti-mycobacterial compounds of D. angustifolia . The remaining bulk of dried, ground plant material (600 g) was divided in half in order to be extracted in the available glassware. Each half was placed in a 4 L Erlenmeyer flask with 2 L DCM. The Erlenmeyer flask 86 was submerged in an ice bath and blended with an Ika\u00ae-Werke T50 Basic Ultra-turrax\u00ae for 7 minutes @ 8800 rpm. The DCM-plant mixture was then filtered in a Buchner funnel lined with an appropriately cut piece of filter paper, and filled with Celite (diatomaceous earth). The marc was returned to the Erlenmeyer flask while the mother liquor was condensed on a B\u00fcchi rotary evaporator. This process was repeated 3 times, with the final extraction nearly colorless indicating an exhaustive extraction. 4.2.1.3. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) Following preparative chromatographic separations, fractions were by TLC. Analytical TLC was performed on pre-coated Alugram\u00ae SIL G/UV 0.20 mm thick silica gel 60 aluminum plates with fluorescent indicator UV 254 (20 x 20 cm; Macherey-Nagel, D\u00fcren, Germany). Plates were cut in half (10 x 20 cm) and meticulously spotted in evenly-spaced 4 mm dashes to afford 24 spots per plate. Plates were developed in unsaturated glass Desaga TLC chambers using the following solvent Once plates were developed to within one centimeter of the top of the plate, they were removed to dry. Dried TLC plates were examined under UV light at 254 nm and 366 nm. Spots visible under short wavelength UV were indicated with a \")\" to the right of the spot drawn in pencil. Spots visible under long wavelength UV were indicated with a \"[\" to the left of the spot drawn in pencil. Plates were then dipped into a fresh mixture of general purpose anisaldehyde reagent ( p-anisaldehyde- H2SO4-HOAc, 1:1:48), drained and heated Camag TLC plate heater III at 105 \u00baC for about a minute, or until vividly colorful spots were visible (Wagner and Bladt, 1996). If overheated, the plate begins to develop a pink hue and spot colors will turn to dark gray or brown and then fade. All TLC chromatograms were then immediately scanned into Adobe Photoshop at 300 dpi on a Dell workstation. Images were cropped and then saved. The final step in the TLC process was applying Photoshop autolevels to the image, which would significantly increase the contrast of spot colors over the background color. 4.2.1.4. Partitioning In preparation for CCC fractionation, the crude extract of D. angustifolia was dissolved in 2 L of biphasic CCC solvent system HEMWat-7, (hexanes, ethyl acetate, methanol, and water mixed in a ratio of 9:1:9:1) in a 2 L separation funnel. After shaking vigorously and allowing the two phases to settle, the lower (aqueous) phase was 88 removed. A new lower phase of 900 ml of methanol and 100 ml water, was added to the remaining upper phase, shaken, allowed to equilibrate and removed. This was repeated six times. The upper phase and combined lower phases were evaporated in vacuo and submitted to bioassay. 4.2.1.5. Countercurrent chromatography (CCC) Preliminary fractionation of the aqueous phase of the partitioned extract was on a CCC-1000 J-type three-coiled planetary motion HSCCC (Pharma-Tech Research Corp., Baltimore, MD, USA), which has a rotation radius of 7.5 cm, using 3 x 283 ml PTFE Teflon coils with an inner diameter (i.d.) of 2.6 mm, an outer diameter (o.d.) of 4.1 mm, and beta values from 0.47 to 0.73. The HSCCC system was equipped with a Lab-Alliance Series III digital single-piston solvent pump, a Shimadzu SPD-10A VP UV-vis detector with preparative flow cell, a Cole-Parmer modular paperless recorder model 80807-00, and a Pharmacia Biotech RediFrac 95-tube fraction collector. Due to sample size limitations, the extract was divided in half and dissolved in 25 ml of the biphasic system. Adjustments to the machine involving the replacement of all connection tubing (\"flying leads\") with larger i.d. tubing (2.6 mm versus 1.6 mm) allowed significantly higher flow rates without pressure problems (10 ml/min versus 1.5 ml/min). Sample injection occurred 89 following equilibrium at a constant rotation speed of 900 rpm. Flow rate throughout the run was 10 ml/min in normal mode with the upper (organic) phase as the mobile phase. HSCCC runs were undertaken with the strategy of elusion-extrusion CCC as described in the literature (Berthod, et al., 2003). Fractions were collected in a similar fashion as described previously (Inui, et al., 2005), consisting of an \"A\" fraction of K 0.4, a series of 10 ml (1 min) \"B\" fractions, and a \"C\" fraction. However, due to the elusion-extrusion technique applied to the run, the \"C\" fraction was collected in a series of fractions throughout the extrusion phase. Three HSCCC runs were conducted in series, following the polarity gradient of HEMWat solvent systems. The first run was made with HEMWat 0 (5:5:5:5). The \"A\" fraction from the first run was injected in to the HSCCC for the second run in HEMWat -3 (6:4:6:4). The resulting \"A\" fraction from the HEMWat -3 run was then injected into the HSCCC with the solvent system in HEMWat -5 (7:3:7:3). Fractions were combined based on TLC profiles and submitted to bioassay. 4.2.1.6. Vacuum liquid chromatography (VLC) In order to apply vacuum pressure to standard column chromatography, Avicel\u00ae microcrystalline cellulose was packed into a \"Quick Separation Funnel\" (Chemglass Inc., Vineland, NJ). Starting above the glass frits at the bottom of the column, a precisely cut disk of filter paper was placed, followed by the indicated amount for each 90 separation of dry cellulose. The cellulose was slowly poured into the column while tapping the sides to maintain homogeneity. Vacuum pressure was applied using a diaphragm vacuum pump (Brandtech Scientific Inc.) in intervals between pouring to help the microcrystalline cellulose settle evenly. Additionally, a long glass tamper was used to press down the cellulose from the top of the column. Once the cellulose was tamped and settled into a uniform cylinder, another disk of filter paper was placed above it. The sample was then dissolved in solvent and mixed with cellulose at a ratio of two to one in a mortar and pestle in the hood. Once the solvent had dried off, the sample was poured into the column and topped with a third disk of filter paper. Sand was poured on top of the third piece of filter paper and topped with cotton to reduce streaking in the column. Solvent aliquots were then poured into the column along a gradient of polarity. Fractions were collected with vacuum pressure into 1000 ml round bottom flasks while maintaining a slow constant flow. Afterwards, they were dried on a B\u00fcchi rotary evaporator and transferred to small weighed vials. An aliquot of each sample was submitted to bioassay. 4.2.1.7. Fast centrifugal partition chromatography (FCPC) Active fractions from VLC were combined and separated on a Kromaton FCPC instrument with a 1 L rotor (true volume 943 ml), with 1/16\" connections. The FCPC system was equipped with a Lab-Alliance 91 Series III digital single-piston solvent pump, a Shimadzu SPD-10A VP UV-vis detector with preparative flow cell, a Cole-Parmer modular paperless recorder model 80807-00, and a Pharmacia Biotech ether:acetonitrile (10:1:10) was based polarity of the sample from VLC. The FCPC run also took advantage of the elusion- extrusion strategy as described in the literature (Berthod, et al., 2003). Fractions were collected in a similar fashion as described in previous studies, with an \"A\" fraction of K 0.3, a series of 10 ml (1min) \"B\" fractions, and a \"C\" fraction (Inui, et al., 2005). However, due to the elusion-extrusion technique applied to the run, the \"C\" fraction was collected in a series of fractions throughout the extrusion. Every fifth fraction was submitted to TB bioassay. 4.2.1.8. Medium pressure liquid chromatography (MPLC) MPLC was carried out with a Waters Delta 600 multisolvent delivery system equipped with a single wavelength UV detector (Shimadzu SPD-10AV UV) and a LKB Bromma 211 Multitrac fraction collector, using glass MPLC columns (Hodge and self-made columns designed by Guido Pauli, unpublished) packed with various sorbents and referred to as; reverse-phase silica gel (RP, LiChroprep RP-18, 10 \u00b5m, particle size 500 x 10 mm g), cyano-derivatized silica gel (CN, LiChrCN 100 \u00c5 spherical 10 \u00b5m, particle size 500 x 10 mm 15 g), or normal phase 92 silica gel (NP, 221CN60 60 \u00c5 irreg. 12-26 \u00b5m, particle size 750 x 10 mm 25 g). All MPLC runs were conducted using a linear solvent gradient consisting of hexanes, ethyl acetate, acetonitrile and water. Flow rates ranged from 2 ml/min to 5 ml/min based on the column used, though fractions were collected in 10 ml fractions. 4.2.2. Structural elucidation 4.2.2.1. NMR NMR spectra were MHz and a Bruker DPX 400 MHz instruments. Instruments were maintained by Drs. D. Lankin and A. Krunic at the College of Pharmacy, UIC. Offline data processing and analysis were conducted using Nuts (NMR Utility Transform Software; Acorn NMR, Inc.) and HNMR and CNMR databases of ACD Labs (Advanced Chemistry Development, Inc.). Line resolution of experimental data was enhanced by Lorentz-Gauss (LG) transformation, using individually determined parameters. Whenever possible, samples were run in CDCl 3 to allow direct comparisons among spectra, without solvent effects on chemical shifts (Gunther, 1998). Pulse programs used were: zg30 hmbcacbigpl2ndqf for HMBC. 93 4.2.2.2. Optical rotation Optical Rotation data were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer 241 polarimeter and calculated with the equation: [ ]20 = /lc, where l is the path-length in decimeters and c is the concentration in g/ml. 4.2.3. Biological activity Following each major chromatographic step, as described above, all fractions were tested in vitro against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37R v. Biological data were provided by Drs. Scott Franzblau and Yuehong Wang as described in chapter 3.4.2. Biological data were processed by plotting chromatographic fractions against percent inhibition of M. tuberculosis H37R v growth at various test concentrations, forming a biochromatogram. 4.2.4. Biochemometric characterization In order to quantitatively evaluate the bioactivity of D. angustifolia , fractions from the FCPC run were submitted to the novel profiling method, biochemometric characterization. This was done in semi- quantitative (TLC) and quantitative (GC) modes by statistically comparing chemical analysis profiles with the transition of bioactivity in subsequent FCPC fractions. 94 4.2.4.1. TLC method FCPC fractions were analyzed by TLC as described above, utilizing a CHCl 3:MeOH (95:5) solvent system. All detected spots, both under UV light or with p-anisaldehyde reagent, were counted and detailed based on their starting and ending points of elution. Due to the partition chromatography foundation of FCPC, it can be calculated that all compounds elute in a gaussian distribution (Craig, 1944). Each spot was then fit to a Gaussian peak with a standard height (10) among the fractions in which it was detected. The biochromatogram from the FCPC run was then deconvoluted to gaussian peaks, identifying three major peaks of activity. The peaks for bioactivity were statistically compared to the detected TLC spots, using a Pearson correlation with SPSS software (Aldenerfer and Blashfield, 1984). Since the Pearson correlation calculates a comparison of peaks based on their shape and distribution without regard to peak height, TLC spot peak heights could be arbitrarily assigned (Aldenerfer and Blashfield, 1984). Correlations were set to range from 0 to 1. 4.2.4.2. GC method Semi-quantitative biochemometric characterization was carried chromatograms with deconvoluted bioactivity peaks (biochromatograms). Since biochemometric characterization had not been fully developed at the time of FCPC fractionation of D. 95 angustifolia , samples for GC/MS were recovered from bioassay samples, submitted following fractionation. Samples had been stored at a stock concentration of 12.8 mg/ml in DMSO at -80 \u00b0C for just under 3 months. They were thawed and aliquoted into GC micro-vials (200 \u00b5l) in the quantity of \u00b5l in the literature (Janicsak, et al., 2003). Gas chromatography was performed on a Varian CP 3800 instrument equipped with a Varian 1200 quadrupole mass spectrometer and fitted with a 30 m x 0.25 mm x 0 25 \u00b5m FactorFour TM VF-5ms column. Helium was used as a carrier gas at 1 ml/min. Splitless injections of 1 ul at 240 \u00b0C were used for all samples. Oven temperature increased from 50 \u00b0C in a linear gradient of 10 \u00b0C/min for 23 minutes. Once reaching 280 \u00b0C, the temperature was quickly raised (100 \u00b0C/min) to 300 \u00b0C, where it was held for the remaining 6.8 minutes of a 30- minute run. MS was detected in positive EI mode with centroid scans from 50-650 m/z. Blank runs of DCM were used in between fractions with the same temperature program to cleanse the system. GC/MS chromatograms were statistically compared to the same deconvoluted bioactivity peaks as described above, using a Pearson correlation with SPSS software (Aldenerfer and Blashfield, 1984). In order to make SPSS analysis possible, GC chromatograms (with nearly 3000 data points) were each divided into 4 sections of 700 data points. This 96 method not only allowed SPSS analysis, but also gave a chance to calibrate each GC chromatogram section with the other sections in its analytical group. Due to minimal differences between GC retention times in subsequent runs, analysis can be imprecise. To remedy this, the major peak of each section of chromatogram was used as a calibration point for GC retention time. Pearson correlations were then graphed overlaying the GC/MS chromatogram of the most active FCPC fraction. 4.3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 4.3.1. Chromatography 4.3.1.1. Plant extraction The 600 g of dried, ground leaves of D. angustifolia yielded 16.8 g of dried dichloromethane extract, representing an extraction yield of 2.8%. 4.3.1.2. Countercurrent chromatography (CCC) While the most common methods of chromatography used with crude plant extracts involve adsorption chromatography, countercurrent chromatography (CCC), a partition chromatography method, is a powerful tool in the preliminary stages of crude extract fractionation (Hostettmann and Marston, 2001). With the ability to attain high resolution, modern CCC methods, such as high-speed countercurrent 97 chromatography (HSCCC), have been able to can reduce the difficulties involved in natural product drug discovery, i.e., the expensive and time- consuming steps to isolate active constituents. Due to the lack of a solid stationary phase, CCC has no irreversible absorption, therefore, providing loss-less fractionation. Since samples are simply partitioned between different solvent systems there is 100% theoretical sample recovery. In crude plant fractionation this is particularly valuable, because it eliminates the chances of \"losing\" the activity during fractionation. This benefit of CCC allows researchers to address the issues of synergy between compounds to explain biological activity from plants, versus wondering if active cons tituents were irreversibly absorbed to a solid stationary phase during fractionation (Alvi, 2001). Modern CCC is an evolution of the theory of partition chromatography developed by Martin and Synge, who won a Nobel prize for their innovation in 1952 (Martin and Synge, 1941; Synge, 1946; 1952). Lyman Craig applied the theory of partition chromatography by combining multiple chromatographic steps in succession leading to the development of countercurrent distribution techniques (Craig, et al., 1947; Craig, 1943; 1944; Craig, et al., 1946; Craig and Post, 1949). In modern CCC, a liquid stationary phase (one phase of a two-phase solvent system) is held in place with centrifugal force. When the second phase of the solvent system is pumped through the stationary phase, compounds are separated based on their distribution between the two phases. The 98 elution time for a specific compound is determined by its partition coefficient (K), a defining characteristic for a compound in a specific solvent system. Recent work in the field of CCC has indicated that the ideal solvent system for a particular analyte is one in which the partition coefficient for the analyte in the solvent system is between 0.4 and 2.5 (Friesen and Pauli, 2005). This region of the chromatogram, where K is between 0.4 and 2.5, has been referred to as the \"sweet spot\" (\"B\" fraction range) due to the high resolution of separation. While separation utilizing silica gel-based adsorption chromatography has limited resolution over a wide (gradient) polarity range of the phases involved, the separation using countercurrent techniques maximizes resolution in a small segment of the total polarity range of the sample. Compounds outside of this segment elute with lower or no resolution, while compounds within the targeted polarity range, \"sweet spot\", are resolved more effectively. Depending on the solvent system selection, this window of high-resolution can be shifted in either direction along the range of polarity (see Figure 9). In the preliminary fractionation of D. angustifolia, HSCCC was first run in normal mode, with the organic phase mobile. Therefore, fraction \"A\" contained the least polar analytes, and fraction \"C\", the most polar analytes of the partitioned extract. 99 To solve the problem of preliminary fractionation using CCC being limited to a narrow polarity window, two advanced techniques were utilized. As seen in Figure 9, ideal preliminary fractionation would extend to allow higher resolution separation in the \"A\" and \"C\" ranges. Elution-extrusion countercurrent chromatography was developed to effectively extend the \"sweet spot\" in the \"C\" direction to allow high resolution separation of larger K values (Berthod, et al., 2003). In traditional CCC, once the experiment is run to an acceptable K value (K2.5), the experiment is stopped and the stationary phase is removed to form the \"C\" fraction. Berthod's group determined that by maintaining rotation while the stationary phase is extruded, the separation of analytes throughout the partitioned stationary phase retain their separation. As a result, compounds continue to elute with high resolution of separation. Due to the novelty of this approach, studies have yet to test how far the sweet spot is extended, but it can be estimated to extend to a K value of 10-20. The second innovation was applied to extend separation of the \"A\" fraction with high resolution. By injecting the \"A\" fraction into a less polar solvent system such as HEMWat -3, the \"B\" range (\"sweet spot\") of high resolution is shifted to separate less polar compounds with high resolution (Figure 10). The \"A\" fraction from the second run was then fractionated in the solvent system HEMWat -5. Consequently, the gradient array of HSCCC runs used in the preliminary fractionation of D. angustifolia covered the wide polarity 100 range of the HEMWat system with the resolution of CCC. Future CCC work could utilize orthagonal solvent systems and expand the gradient array of HSCCC runs over the entire range of solvent polarities equal to that of a silica gel based column but with the high resolution of CCC. 101 Figure 9. HSCCC separation versus Vacuum Liquid Chromatography in the fractionation of crude extracts. In contrast to adsorption techniques (such as VLC) where irreversible absorption and decomposit ion (indicated as parenthesis) are more likely to occur, CCC allows lossless separation. The above figure shows CCC separations using different solvent syst ems to target different windows of polarity (B) to isolate active principles. abcdef g h I j k l m n o p q r s tuvwxyz ab c d e f g h I j k l m n o p r stuvwxyz a bc d e g h j k l mn o q r s u vw x z (f, i, p, t, y)K = 0.4 K = 2.5A B (\"sweet spot\") C B1..........BnCCC VLCSolvent system 1 Solvent system 2abcdef g h I j k l m n o p q r s tuvwxyz ab c d e f g h I j k l m n o p r stuvwxyz a bc d e g h j k l mn o q r s u vw x z (f, i, p, t, y)K = 0.4 K = 2.5A B (\"sweet spot\") C B1..........BnCCC VLCSolvent system 1 Solvent system 2 103 Additionally, since the sample submitted to gradient array HSCCC was first partitioned in solvent system HEMWat -7, the final \"A\" fraction from HEMWat -5 was less concentrated with highly lipophilic compounds. These methods were highly suited for the investigation anti- mycobacterial compounds since the TB assay is not an enzyme based or receptor binding in vitro assay. Since samples are tested against an in vitro cell line there is less of a concern regarding the elimination of compounds producing \"false-positive\" test results such as tannins, fatty acids or polyphenols (Armbruster, et al., 2001). Consequently, there is no need for the a priori elimination of those fractions that contain these compounds, since there is full legitimacy for a potential antitubercular compound to be present in the same polarity range. Instead, partitioning was chosen based on the lack of resolution that occurs as solvent systems move towards the extremes in solvent ratios. At a ratio of 9:1:9:1, there would be limited resolution in the \"B\" range, so it was concluded to partition the extract before hand. Partitions of the crude D. angustifolia extract were tested in MABA before they were separated with HSCCC, in order to confirm the bioactivity of the bulk material. The lower phase was significantly more active than its lipophilic counterpart with 72% inhibition at 50 \u00b5g/ml. However, the upper phase partition contained more biomass 9.96 g versus 6.81 g. 104 The capacity of the HSCCC instrument in the lab could not accommodate the 6.81 g, so it was divided into two subsamples. When fractions from the first subsample separated in gradient array HSCCC runs were evaluated on TLC, it became apparent that there was significant overlap of the HEMWat -3 sweet spot fractions and the fractions from the other two runs (HEMWat 0 and HEMWat -5). Consequently, when the second subsample was run, the \"A\" fraction from the initial run (in HEMWat 0) was combined with the set of \"B\" fractions from the HEMWat -3 fractions of the first subsample, and injected directly into the HEMWat -5. Thus, only solvent systems HEMWat 0 and HEMWat -5 were effectively needed to cover the polarity gradient for preliminary fractionation (see Figure 11). Fractions were combined based on their TLC profiles resulting in 11 fractions (F1-F11). Each fraction was tested in the TB bioassay with the results graphed into a biochromatogram (Figure 11). The results from the TB bioassay of the HSCCC gradient array fractions indicated that the anti-mycobacterial activity centered on fraction F3. After re-evaluating TLC results of fractions F2 and F4, the three fractions were combined and weighed. 105 Figure 11. Preliminary fractionation of D. angustifolia and corresponding biochromatogram. Final resulting fractions are identified as F1-F11. Fractions marked with an X were later combined with the \"A\" fraction from HEMWat 0 of the second subsample and injected directly into HEMWat -5.

Vacuum liquid chromatography (VLC) The 2 g of combined fractions F2-F4 from the HSCCC gradient array was then dissolved in DCM and mixed onto 4 g of dried cellulose for vacuum liquid chromatography. The 100 ml VLC column was packed with 40 g of dried microcrystalline cellulose and the sample. A solvent gradient from 100% hexane to 100% ethyl acetate to 100% methanol in 30 ml aliquots was used to elute the column. The first aliquot of hexane was 40 ml, in order to wet the column. Subsequent aliquots contained 2 ml (7%) more of the next solvent until 100% EtOAc was reached. The final fractions with MeOH went in intervals of 10 ml (33%) (Figure 12), resulting in 19 fractions that were evaluated with TLC, using the solvent systems CHCl 3:MeOH (90:10) and Hex:EtOAc (70:30). All 19 fractions were dried, weighed and tested in the TB assay. The results indicated that the most non-polar fractions were both the highest in weight and % inhibition of M. tuberculosis (Figure 13). 107 Figure 12.

Second level fractionation: VLC and corresponding biochromatogram resulting in fractions Figure 4.3.1.4. Fast centrifugal partition chromatography (FCPC) Fractions F12-F14 were combined and followed up in FCPC. Since fractions F12-F14 eluted ethy acetate, it was clear that the anti-TB activity of D. angustifolia could be attributed to the very non-polar compounds. Consequently, in order to separate these compounds by means of partition chromatography, an adequately nonpolar solvent system was required. After consulting the literature, the solvent system hexane: methyl-tert butyl ether:acetonitrile (10:1:10) was chosen (Degenhardt, et al., 2001). Due to the nearly 1.5 g sample size for injection into the FCPC, a newly designed 1 L rotor (true volume 943 ml) was installed. The sample was dissolved in 10 ml of the biphasic solvent system (1:1) and injected, following equilibrium, at a constant rotation speed of 1000 rpm. Flow rate throughout the run was 10 ml/min in reverse-phase mode, with the lower phase as the mobile phase. Stationary phase retention was 90%, and the instrument pressure ranged from 60 psi in filling the stationary phase (no rotation) to 400 psi when running the experiment. Elution-extrusion FCPC resulted in 200 fractions. Effective separation could be predicted based on the colored appearance of the fraction test tubes (Figure 14). Fractions were evaluated with TLC and every fifth fraction was submitted to bioassay. TLC confirmed effective separation with 45 distinct spots being detected (Figure 14). Bioassay 110 results were graphed against fractions as a biochromatogram and compared to TLC profiles in an attempt to identify the TLC spots of the potentially active compounds. Based on the combination of bioassay and TLC results, fractions were combined to 9 fractions (Figure 15). 112 Figure 15. FCPC separation of fractions F12-F14 and corresponding biochromatogram.

Fraction 20 was evaluated in TLC and 8 appeared as a large yellow spot. 4.3.3. Spectroscopy and the use of the ACD database During the structural elucidation of the compounds isolated from D. angustifolia , the ACD database was used as a tool in identifying potential structures and making compound identifications. This proved an invaluable tool, expediting compound elucidation by orders of magnitude. Through a comparison of experimental chemical shift values, primarily from 13C NMR spectra, with those in the ACD database, a starting molecule could be quickly identified. Once a structural starting point had been established, traditional evaluation of spectroscopic data could either confirm the ACD identified structure or resolve structural differences to allow accurate compound identification. Use of the ACD database does not imply that structural elucidation was performed automatically. There are several caveats to using the 117 ACD software program. The main risk in using the ACD database is the chance of erroneous dereplication. Since the database is compiled with published literature that have been entered 'as is' into the database, often times there are incorrect chemical shift assignments, incomplete data, or inaccurate structural configurations. A perfect example of this is, cholesterol, which has data from 4 different references entered into the database. Carbon shift values seem to vary greatly between the four references used. With closer inspection it was found that this is due to inconsistent assignments of chemical shifts, or inconsistent numbering of carbons in the molecule. Compound 5, discussed below did not match any set of cholesterol data found in the database as it was cited. However, by looking at the full set of data from the 4 references and acknowledging the inconsistencies it was identified as a close match and was used as a starting point for further structural investigation. As a result, structural elucidation supported with use of the ACD database requires scrupulous investigation into the literature in order to prevent dereplicating a compound incorrectly. Many compounds have similar chemical shifts, and often data found in ACD in incomplete. During the use of ACD in the current study, typical results were in the range of 100 compounds that would match based on entering 13C NMR chemical shifts. The database does not take into account overlapping signals, but searches can be further narrowed down by limiting the number of carbons for identified matches. This step typically resulted in 10-50 118 compounds. Then through investigation of each of the matches a 'best match' could be assigned. This compound, depending on the quality of the match in data, could be used as a starting point for structural elucidation., While it is far from being an automatic structural elucidator, the use of the ACD database in identified a structural starting point for elucidation was highly efficient. Where compound identification could have taken weeks, compounds could be elucidated in days. 4.3.4. Characterization of isolated compounds 4.3.4.1. Characterization of ergosterol-5,8-endoperoxide ( 1) The 1H NMR spectra of 1 quickly identified it as a triterpene or steroid, based on the collection of aliphatic methyl and methylene signals between 2.5 and 0.5 ppm. Two doublets and 6.482 ppm indicated strongly deshielded olefinic protons, while the typical 7 line dddd signal at 3.949 ppm was recognized as the axial geminal proton of a 3-OH function. An eight line signal around 5 ppm was identified as a pair of dd signals, indicating a second double bond. The 13C NMR Chemical shift values were then searched in the ACD CNMR database. Comparisons of relevant compounds, limited to those containing 28 to 30 carbons, identified an endoperoxide sterol with a cyclopropanol substituted side chain (5 ,8-epidioxy-22,23-methylene-24- methylcholest-6-en-3 -ol) as the closest match (Sheu, et al., 2000). However, slight differences in the spectra indicated that it was not an 119 exact match. Instead of 13C NMR values of 24.2 and 25.1 ppm for carbons C-22 and C-23, signals were located at 135.105 and 132.195 ppm, respectively, indicating the presence of the second double bond. HSQC confirmed the match of olefinic proton signals with their corresponding 13C NMR signals. HMBC confirmed the placement of the endoperoxide group at positions C-5 and C-8 and the placement of the double bonds. Using HSQC and HMBC spectra, full proton assignment was possible and compound 1 was identified as ergosterol-5,8- endoperoxide. Previous papers on ergosterol-5,8-endoperoxide with published NMR values are limited and are shown in comparison to experimental values in Table 9. Discrepancies were found with the published literature in the assignment of the two sets of olefinic protons. Gunatilaka et al assigned the higher field signals of each pair to protons H-7 and H-22 (Gunatilaka, et al., 1981). However, HSQC and HMBC data identified the higher field signals to H-6 and H-23. Collaborations with Charles Cantrell of the USDA, who had previously isolated and synthesized ergosterol-5,8-endoperoxide, allowed the comparison of the experimental NMR spectra of 1 with those of confirmed ergosterol-5,8- endoperoxide. The NMR data used to identify ergosterol-5,8- endoperoxide were not published since structural elucidation was confirmed by x-ray crystallography (Cantrell, et al., 1999). The experimental spectra were within 0.015 ppm for 1H NMR and 0.025 ppm for 13C NMR of the ergosterol-5,8-endoperoxide spectra. This confirmed 120 the configuration of the endoperoxide group. [Note: experimental spectra were analyzed at 100 MHz, while reviewed spectra was conducted at 75 MHz.) Compound 1 was analyzed in GC/MS, which identified the molecular ion at m/z 428, which confirmed the formula C 28H44O3. Additional ion signals were identified at m/z 396 (-O 2), 353 (-CO 2+O2), 301, 275 (-side chain), 255 (-side chain+H 2O), and 213 (Figure 21).

Preliminary analysis of the 1H NMR spectra of compound 2 indicated a large group of methylene protons between 1.00 and 1.60 ppm and a large group of overlapping signals between 0.80 and 0.87 ppm that integrated for 12 protons and was interpreted as 4 methyl groups. Three down-field dd signals indicated protons attached to carbons bearing oxygen ( 4.20, 3.69 and 3.52), while two prominent singlets indicated olefinic protons ( 5.12 and 4.97). The 13C NMR Chemical shift values were then searched in the ACD CNMR database. Comparisons of relevant compounds, limited to those containing 20 to 22 carbons, identified an accurate match with the geranyl-geraniol derivative, phytene-1,2-diol (Rodriguez and Acosta, 1997). The olefinic proton signals matched well with C-17 ( C 148.7ppm), and the signals for two hydroxylated carbons ( 65.6 protons H-1a, H-1b, and H-2. Closer analysis of the methyl signals led to the identification of 2 doublet signals at 0.844 and 0.860 ppm and two overlapping doublet signals at 0.866 ppm. Signals between 1.9 and 2.1 ppm were identified as two partially overlapping ddd signals and assigned to H-4a and H-4b (see Figure 22). After consulting the literature, it was found that in three of the four published reports of compound 2, it was reported as new (Brown, 1994; Chen, et al., 2003; 129 Rodriguez and Acosta, 1997; Urones, et al., 1987). The 13C NMR values matched precisely with those from Brown et al (within 0.05 ppm) and, therefore, stereochemical moieties were assigned to match; 7 R and 11 R (Brown, 1994; Brown, et al., 2003). Compound 2 was identified through derivatized GC/MS anaylsis. Major signals were identified at m/z 352, 337(-CH 3), 338, 262, 129, 75,(C 3H10Si) and 67 were found.

Selective 1H NMR assignments are given, because the majority of methylene and methine group signals are indistinguis hable, as they overlap between 1.6 and1.0 ppm. Differences between literat ure values and experimental values were less than 0.05 ppm for 13C NMR values and heteronuclear 2D NMR data, full proton assignment unattainable, however due to the minute differences in experimental and published NMR values can be confidently identified as phytene-1,2-diol.

Characterization of linoleic acid ( 3) Compound 3 was isolated as a dark green smearing spot on TLC, characteristic of a fatty acid. Preliminary analysis of the 1H NMR spectra of compound 3 indicated overlapping signals at 5.34 ppm that integrated for 4 protons when setting the signal at 27.2 ppm for 2H. The four signals at 5.34 ppm were deduced to represent four olefinic protons. One methyl group was identified as a triplet signal at 0.87 ppm. Down-field shifted methylene protons associated with either the double bonds or oxygen-bearing carbons were identified at 2.75, 2.33 and 2.03 ppm. The 13C NMR Chemical shift values were then searched in the ACD CNMR database, ignoring potential overlap of the methylene signals. Comparisons of relevant compounds, limited to those containing 18 to 20 carbons, identified an accurate match with linoleic acid (Mannina, et al., 2004). Presence of the carboxylic acid was confirmed with a 13C NMR peak at 179.85 ppm. The 1H NMR signal centered at 2.75 ppm as assigned to a methylene group in between two double bonds. HSQC allowed the precise assignments of proton signals with 13C NMR signals, including the distinction between the signals of protons H-12 and H-10 from those of protons H-13 and H-9 (see Figure 27). Location of the double bonds at 9, 10 and 12, 13 was confirmed with long range coupling in HMBC between C-16 and 2H-14 and 3H-18 (see Figure 28). Both double bonds were deduced to have the cis configuration based on proton coupling constants of 13.5 Hz, and comparison to literature 135 values. Two-dimensional NMR data allowed precise proton assignment with the exception of the aliphatic chain segments at 2H-4 to 2H-7 and 2H-15 and 2H-17. Specific carbon assignment was also unattainable for carbons C-4 to C-7. Compound 3 was analyzed in GC/MS which identified the molecular ion at m/z 280, which confirmed the formula C18H32O2. Additional ion signals were identified at m/z 264 (-H 2O), 124, 110, 95, 81, and 67 (Figure 29). Chemical shift values are presented in 11. 136 Figure 25.

Characterization of E-phytol ( 4) The 1H NMR spectra of compound 4 was found to be similar to that of 2 for the long terpenoid chain. Four methyl doublet signals were identified between 0.82 and 0.85 ppm, and signals related to overlapping methylene and methine units were found between 1.00 and 1.45 ppm. The lack of signals related to the exomethylene protons of C-17, and dd signals of protons belonging to C-1 and C-2 of 2 indicated structural differences at the substitiuted polar end of the molecule. Two triplet signals ( 5.387 and 1.967 ppm) were deduced to be signals of protons belonging to a carbon atom between a quaternary carbon and a methylene group. A strong singlet at 1.647 ppm, that integrated for three protons, indicated a methyl group attached to a quaternary carbon. The signal at 5.387 ppm indicated the presence of a double bond, while the doublet at 4.133 ppm indicated the presence of oxygen, most likely in the form of a hydroxyl group. The 13C NMR spectra of 4 appeared very similar to that of 2. The two most noticeable changes were a lack of signals at 75.0 and 110.6 ppm, and the addition of signals at 16.2 and 123.1 ppm in the spectra of 4. These differences paired with the information obtained in the 1H NMR spectra, which identified compound 4 as phytol. When compared to the literature, NMR values matched those for the trans isomer (Brown, 1994; Siddiqui, et al., 1994). Optical rotation data was measured in chlo roform and found to be +0.2\u00b0, which 143 was consistent with the literature for the 2 E, 7R, 11R form (Connolly and Hill, 1991). Compound 4 was analyzed in GC/MS which identified the molecular ion at m/z 296, which confirmed the formula C 20H40O. Additional ion signals were identified at m/z 278 (-H 2O), 123, 95, 81 and 67 (Figure 32). Chemical shift values are presented in Table 12. 144 Figure 30.

Characterization of cholesterol ( 5) Compound 5 was identified on TLC as a light blue spot with no UV absorbance detected. The 1H NMR spectra allowed quick identification of 5 as a triterpene or steroid, based on the collection of signals between 2.5 and 0.5 ppm. The spectra were very closely related to 1, with a complex dddd signal around 3.7 ppm with J values of 4.6, 5.6, 9.7, and 11.0 Hz. This was interpreted as an H-3 axial proton on a hydroxyl substituted carbon. Another diagnostic proton signal was located at 5.344 ppm. This signal showed coupling constants of 5.4 (J 6,7eq) and 2.1 (J 6, 4eq, J6,7ax) Hz. This was deduced to be an olefinic and was assigned to position H-6. The 13C NMR Chemical shift values were then searched in the ACD CNMR database. Comparisons of relevant compounds, limited to those containing 27 to 30 carbons, identified an accurate match with cholesterol. Consistency in the ACD carbon assignments led to comparison of the carbon shift values with those from the literature (Blunt and Stothers, 1977). Comparison to the literature and HSQC data led to full proton assignment (see Table 13) (Muhr, et al., 1996). Additionally, compound 5 was analyzed by GC/MS, and a fragmentation comparison with the NIST MS database confirmed compound 5 to be cholesterol. Major signals were identified at m/z 386 (parent ion), 368 (-H 2O), 353 (-CH 3+H2O), 301, 275 (-side chain), 255 (- side chain+H 2O), and 213. 149 Figure 33.

The 1H NMR spectra of compound 6 were nearly identical to that of compound 5. The only visible differences were found in the overlapping methylene/methine signals between 1 and 2 ppm. Due to the success in identifying cholesterol with GC/MS, compound 6 was run with the same analytical method. An MS fragmentation comparison with the NIST MS database identified compound 6 as 22,23-dihyrdostigmasterol ( -sitosterol). Major signals were identified at m/z 414 (parent ion), 399 (-CH 3), 396 (-H 2O), 381 (- CH3+H2O), 329, 303, 273 (-side chain), 255 (-side chain+H 2O), and 213. (See Figure 38) Compound 6 was confirmed to be -sitosterol by its 13C NMR spectra, which showed minor differences from 5, in signals in the side chain. The addition of an ethyl group substituted on carbon C-24 was identified as the source to these differences. Through a comparison with the literature, initially using the ACD database, full carbon assignment was made. It is interesting to note the lack of comprehensive 2D NMR based proton assignment in the literature for -sitosterol. However, clionasterol, the C-24 epimer of -sitosterol, has undergone full spectral analysis (Reynolds, et al., 1997). Distinction between the two epimers is argued in the literature to be demonstrated by minor differences between 13C NMR chemical shift values of carbons in close 154 proximity to C-24. These differences found in the literature are very small and could possibly fall within the range of experimental diversity. Experimental chemical shift values are shown alongside published values for both -sitosterol and clionasterol in Table 14. 155 Figure 36. Compound 6 (-sitosterol) 400 MHz 1H NMR spectrum in CDCl 3.

Characterization of 4,14,28-trimethyl-stigmasta-7,25-dien-3-ol ( 7) Compound 7 showed no UV detection on TLC, but was identified as a large purple spot. The 1H NMR spectrum of compound 7 was similar to that of 5 and 6, and identified 7 as a triterpene. Key visible differences were two additional narrow signals at 4.766 and 4.629 ppm, indicating the presence of a second double bond. Closer inspection revealed that the signal at 4.766 ppm was actually a dq, and that it and its neighboring signal at 4.629 ppm belonged to terminal methylene protons. This was confirmed based on coupling constants of 2.8 Hz for each signal. It was also noted that the dddd signals around 3.5 ppm for 5 and 6, corresponding to axial H-3 protons on hydroxylated carbons, had been replaced by a td signal. This was deduced as a substitution at positions C-2 or C-4. The 13C NMR spectra and APT spectra surprisingly showed 32 carbons, five more than 5 and 3 more than 6. When the 13C NMR Chemical shift values were searched in the ACD CNMR database and compared to compounds, limited to those containing 32 carbons, no reasonable match could be made. The APT spectrum, paired with HSQC data allowed the determination of eight methyl groups, ten methylene groups, eight tertiary carbons and five quaternary carbon atoms in the molecule, and calculated to a molecular formula of C 32H54O. Due to the success in identifying cholesterol and - sitosterol with GC/MS, compound 7 was run with the same analytical method. Major signals were identified at m/z 454 (parent ion), 439 (- 160 CH3), 426 (-H2O), 245, 159 and 83. Unfortunately, no comparable MS spectra were found in the NIST database. Through meticulous comparison to similar compounds in the literature and analysis of 1H-1H COSY, HSQC, and HMBC data the structure was elucidated as 4,14,28- trimethyl-stigmasta-7,25-dien-3-ol. This compound was then found in the literature having been isolated previously from Tillandsia brachycaulos Schultdl (Bromeliaceae)(Cantillo-Ciau, et al., 2003). Full spectral analysis had been conducted by Cantillo-Ciau et al using 2D data, and while values were within 0.05ppm for 1H NMR signals and 0.1 ppm for 13C NMR values, there was a small discrepancy in the carbon assignments given in the literature and those assigned experimentally. Carbons C-29 and C-30 were exchanged. Eventually, it was concluded that the discrepancy was based on interpretation of the HSQC data (see Figure 41). Once a correction in carbon-proton association had been changed, HMBC correlations could be used to deduce the proper carbon assignments. The final structural result for 7 is an unusual triterpene to be isolated from a terrestrial plant. Similar compounds with unconventional side chains, such as 7, have only been previously isolated from Viola formosana Hayada (Violaceae), al., 2001; Kadota, et al., 1987; Lee, et al., 1993).

It was isolated from the same fraction as 6 and 7, however unlike 6 and 7 it was detected under UV light at 254 nm. The 1H NMR spectra of compound 8 were nearly identical to that of compound 6. The main difference was the lack of a 1H NMR signal around 3.5ppm. This was deduced to signify oxygenation of the C-3 hydroxyl group from - sitosterol. The 13C NMR spectra confirmed the presence of a ketone at C- 3 with a signal at 171.4 ppm .

All of the isolated compounds had been previously identified from terrestrial plants. Ergosterol-5,8-endoperoxide( 1), linoleic acid ( 3), and trans -phytol ( 4) were highly active and showed MICs of 1, 2, and 1 \u00b5g/ml, respectively. Several of the inactive compounds, - sitosterol ( 6), sitostenone ( 8), and cholesterol ( 5) are common isolates identified in the BGF process conducted for anti-TB activity. This can be explained by their general abundance in the non-polar fractions typically demonstrate the majority of the anti-TB activity. Since the cell wall of M. tuberculosis is highly lipophilic, large active compounds are typically lipophilic in order to pass into the cells and have an effect. A common problem in BGF for anti-TB activity is sorting through these concentrated inactive compounds contained in active fractions. In addition to the compounds elucidated in the current study, numerous others were isolated. However, during the prioritization of compounds for the current study, based on biological activity, they were not fully elucidated. Examples of these types of compounds were fatty acids or those in minute quantities with impurities that could not be elucidated. It is estimated that for every compound that appears in the text, there were three or more compounds that did not. This is a comment on the efficiency for a natural products drug discovery program. Since those 171 compounds that were not prioritized for further study require the same amount of time to isolate as those that were, the argument is made that improvements in the dereplication process are greatly needed. One contribution towards these efforts was the determination of the hexane:MtBE:acetonitrile solvent system in separating inactive compounds from potentially active constituents based on their partition coefficients. This proved highly valuable in the fractionation of F12-F14. Therefore, countercurrent chromatography with this solvent system should be highly considered as a fractionation step towards the beginning of BGF for lipophilic anti-TB constituents. Additionally, Appendix X has been added as a supplementary document to facilitate rapid dereplication of the compounds presented in the text. Appendix X shows key identification and isolation characteristics such as Rf values, and spot characteristics for TLC, key 1H NMR chemical shifts, and CCC partition coefficients. Hopefully, this will facilitate direct recognition of their presence in future projects and prevent time wasted on overlapping work. 4.3.5. Evaluation of anti-TB activity The final product of BGF is typically a pure natural product compound or compounds. Because isolation of the compounds was directed by biological testing, the resulting compounds are then tested 172 for biological activity. However, it is rare that semi-quantitative evaluation is done to compare the biological activity for isolated compounds with the activity of the parent fractions and/or crude plant extract. These simple analyses are highly valuable in allowing scientists to draw conclusions about the relative biological activity of isolated compounds with respect to that of the crude extract and prevent assumptions that the biological activity of chemical isolates can fully explain the biological activity of the starting plant material. Once a highly active compound was isolated and identified from each of the three major active fractions of D. angustifolia , calculations were made to correlate individual isolate bioactivity with that of the parent fractions and crude extract. Three compounds, ergosterol-5,8- endoperoxide, linoleic acid, and phytol, have each been reported in the literature with MICs of 1, 1, and 2 \u00b5g/ml, respectively, against M. tuberculosis H37R v (Cantrell, et al., 1999; Rajab, et al., 1998; Seidel and Taylor, 2004). Ideally, a direct correlation is established between the isolated pure compounds and the crude extract they originate from. In order for the three isolated active compounds to be responsible for the bioactivity of the fractions or crude extract, the bioactivity ratio between fraction and isolate must be greater than the weight ratio between fraction and isolate. After comparing the weight ratio and the activity ratio between 173 parent fractions and the isolated compounds, it was clear that in the active fractions, the active isolate is responsible for the bioactivity. The first example from D. angustifolia was ergosterol-5,8- endoperoxide ( 1) isolated from fraction F32. It was isolated in the quantity of 24 mg, which calculates to 1/7th (14%) of the weight of fraction F32 (175mg). The MIC of ergosterol-5,8-endoperoxide, however is 1 \u00b5g/ml, versus an MIC of 25 \u00b5g/ml for F32. Therefore, ergosterol- 5,8-endoperoxide is 25 times more potent than fraction F32, though it only accounted for 14% of the weight. Similar results were found of isolates linoleic acid ( 3) and trans -phytol ( 4). Linoleic acid was isolated in the quantity of 10 mg from F34 (48 mg), 20% of the weight. F34 had an MIC of 25 \u00b5g/ml versus an MIC of 2 \u00b5g/ml for linoleic acid, 13.5 times more potent for 1/5th the weight. For phytol, the parent fraction (F38) had an MIC greater than 100 \u00b5g/ml, 100 times less potent than phytol. The weight ratio was 11 mg of phytol from 150 mg of fraction F38, a ratio of 14 to 1. A comparison of the crude extract bioactivity was made to the bioactivity of the isolates, using a polynomial equation. Since MIC values are a measure of concentration, they can be multiplied by the weight of the fraction to yield a volume of M. tuberculosis H37R v that will have growth inhibited by 90%, as defined by the bioassay. By calculating the volume of Mycobacterium that the active isolates would inhibit and the volume of Mycobacterium that the crude extract would inhibit, conclusions can be drawn as to whether or not the crude 174 extract's bioactivity can be explained by the isolated compounds and their respective potency. All MIC values were adjusted to what volume of Mycobacterium one milligram of the sample would inhibit. For example, the MIC of the crude extract was 200 \u00b5g/ml which is equal to 1 mg/5 ml. Since 1 mg inhibits 5 ml of Mycobacterium 9960 mg of crude extract would inhibit 49,800 ml or 49.8 L of Mycobacterium. The active isolates totaled 40 L of Mycobacterium that would be inhibited based on their MIC multiplied by their weights. This indicated that the ratio of weight and bioactivity between isolates and the crude extract did not fully explain the bioactivity for the crude extract. Due to the fact that during isolation a compound cannot be 100% recovered, since in practice there is always a loss, there always remains at least a small loss of bioactivity when calculated based on the compound yield. The difference in volume of Mycobacterium inhibited was 9.8 L. In the current case, ergosterol-5,8-endoperoxide and linoleic acid were detected in other fractions through TLC and GC/MS, however since they were isolated and identified from fractions F32 and F34, respectively, they were not isolated from other fractions. If, fractions F32 and F34 were investigated for ergosterol-5,8-endoperoxide and linoleic acid, respectively, and 9.8 mg of ergosterol-5,8-endoperoxide, 19.6 mg of linoleic acid or an appropriate combination of the two were isolated, the bioactivity would be fully explained. As a result, conclusions can be drawn that the anti-tuberculosis activity of the crude extract of D. 175 angustifolia can be explained by the isolation of ergosterol-5,8- endoperoxide ( 1), linoleic acid ( 3) and trans -phytol ( 4). These data are summarized in Table 16. Fraction Weight (mg) Isolate Weight (mg) Weight ratio MIC (\u00b5g/ml)Isolate MIC (\u00b5g/ml) Activity Ratio F32 175 151 E-phytol ( 4) 11 14:1 100 1 100:1 Crude Extract 1, 3, and 4 45 221:1 ~200 ~1.33 150:1 Concentration equated to mg/ml, e.g. 1 mg/ 5 ml Crude extract: 9960 mg \u00f7 1 mg/5 ml = 49, 800 ml = 49.8 L Ergosterol-5,8-endoperoxide ( 1): 24 mg \u00f7 1 mg/1000 ml = 24,000 ml = 24 L Linoleic acid ( 3): 10 \u00f7 1 mg/500 ml = ml 5 L E-phytol ( 4): 11 \u00f7 1 mg/1000 ml = 11,000 ml = 11 L Total for the isolates: 24 L + 5 L + 11L = 40 L Unaccounted for biological activity: 9.8 L Table 16. Evaluation of anti-TB activity in D. angustifolia . Since MIC values are a measure of concentr ation, they can be multiplied by the weight of the fraction to yield a volume of M. tuberculosis H37R v that will have growth inhibited by 90%, as defined by the bioassay. Calculations are shown below the table. These indicated that total crude extract would inhibit 9.8 L more than the total Mycobacterium inhibition of the isolates. 176 4.3.6. Biochemometric analysis During the same time period as the BGF of D. angustifolia and the isolation of the three highly active anti-TB compounds 1, 3, and 4, an ongoing effort in our laboratory, led by Dr. Pauli and Mr. T. Inui, was the development of a new approach to the assignment of bioactive constituents in complex natural product mixtures. This approach consists of two forms of analysis: Biological evaluation of a fine grid chromatographic fractions forming a biochromatogram of the separation steps, and Chemometric evaluation of high-resolution chromatographic analysis of the fractions When the above two analyses are combined, a biochemometric analysis can be performed. When the compounds ergosterol-5,8- endoperoxide, linoleic acid and E-phytol were isolated, they were chosen as a trial subject for the biochemometric approach, in particular because all three isolates represented highly potent active compounds with full biological and chemical data that could be made available to the analysis. 4.3.6.1. Biochromatograms Based on the review of biochromatograms of fractionation steps beginning with crude plant fractionation, it was clear that the anti-TB bioactivity of D. angustifolia was found within the combined fractions 177 F12-F14. FCPC fractionation of F12-F14 divided the bioactivity beyond a single fraction or subsequent fractions (see Figure 15). As a result, the FCPC separation was used as the palette for biochemometric analysis. Since FCPC is founded on the principle of partition chromatography, all bioactive compounds contained in the sample elute with Gaussian distribution (Craig, 1944). Therefore, bioactivity will assume overlapped Gaussian peaks on a biochromatogram. The of the FCPC fractionation step was deconvoluted into Gaussian curves using Origin software, resulting in three main peaks of bioactivity (See Figure 46). 178 Figure 46. Deconvoluted biochromatogram. Three Gaussian peaks were fit from the biochromatogram curve at test concentration of 50 \u00b5g/ml. Each peak represents a separate anti-TB active principle resolved in the FCPC chromatogram. 4.3.6.2. TLC biochemometrics When used for the monitoring of fractions, thin layer chromatography results in a two-dimensional chromatogram that may be interpreted as a plot of fraction number (x-axis) by Rf value (y-axis). In a mathematical sense, each spot repr esents a point on the 2D graph and evaluation typically relies on a visual correlation based on spot color to associate spots with their neighboring spots. On the graph of fraction number versus Rf value, this produces small line segments (Figure 47). One problem of this simplification, in relation to biochemometric analysis, is that, in order to statistically compare peak width and shape of TLC-detected compounds with those from bioactivity, the TLC line 020406080100120 0 50 100 150 200 Fractions of FCPC separations of combined fractions F12-F14M. tuberculosis H37Rv inhibitionBiopeak 1 Biopeak 2 Biopeak 3 179 segments must be converted in the third dimension to yield Gaussian curves. In order to accomplish this, TLC spot fractions were graphed with an arbitrary height of 10 at the center of elution, where elution is at its maximum, for each spot, and 0 at each of the elution endpoints of each spot. For example, the large dark blue spot in Figure 47 begins eluting at fraction 144 and ends at fraction 160; hence, at x=144 and x=160, y was set to 0, and at x=152, y wa s set to 10. This was performed with all visible or UV-detected TLC spots were numbered to ease analysis (Figure 48). The plot resulting from the graph was fit with a Gaussian curve using Origin software and resulted in an equation for each curve: y=y0 + (A/(w*sqrt( /2)))*exp(-2*((x-xc)/w)^2) Where = x-value at width midpoint of the peak w = peak width A = area under peak The curve for each TLC spot was then calculated for each FCPC fraction number resulting in Gaussian curves for each series of TLC spots (Figure 47). The Gaussian-graphed TLC chromatogram was then statistically compared with the deconvoluted biochromatogram peaks, using a Pearson correlation. Results were given in values between 0 and 1, with the higher the correlation, the higher the chances of assigning a bioactive compound. The results are shown in Figure 49. The first bioactivity peak had 3 TLC spots correlating at greater than 70%; spot 6 at 94%, spot 3 at 89%, and spot 5 at 71%. According 180 to these results, spot 6 has the greatest chance of being responsible for the bioactivity at peak 1. The second bioactivity peak had only one TLC spot correlating at greater than 70%; however, spot 18 only correlated at 81%. Bioactivity peak 3 also had three TLC spots that correlate at greater than 70%; spot 31 at 92%, spot 28 at 85%, and spot 41 at 80%. These data indicate a 92% chance that the bioactivity of peak 3 is caused by the compound of spot 31. Since this method is based on the detection of TLC spots, the preciseness of quantification is dependent on the level of detection of the TLC spots. There is no universal TLC detection reagent, and even with a general purpose detection reagent, such as the anisaldehyde-sulfuric acid reagent, there will always be compounds that are not detected and the response factor may differ largely between compounds or groups of compounds. This must be borne mind, together with the fact that when the biologically active compound is present in a concentration above the detection limit of the chosen TLC reagent, Pearson correlations will associate accurately. This was the case for biopeak 1, which showed a 94% correlation with spot 6, which was isolated and identified as the anti-mycobacterial compound, ergosterol-5,8-endoperoxide ( 1). The same can be said for biopeak 3, that showed a 92% correlation with spot 31, which was isolated and identified as E-phytol ( 4), a compound previously identified as anti-mycobacterial. In the case of biopeak 2, TLC biochemometrics did not identify the most active compound found within 181 the biopeak range, i.e. linoleic acid ( 3), because that compound was not sufficiently detected under the given conditions. Nevertheless, biopeak 2 had a Pearson correlation of 81% with TLC spot 18, but because compound 18 was not isolated, conclusions of its lack of activity cannot be drawn. It must be noted that, linoleic acid ( 3), a known potent in vitro mycobacterial growth-inhibiting compound, was isolated from fractions in the range of biopeak 2. Detection of linoleic acid on TLC was not possible, until the next level of fractionation, where it was visible as dark green smears. 182 A. B. Figure 47. TLC results of Gaussian elution profiles of the respective compounds eluted from FCPC TLC spots were graphed with an arbitrary height of 10 at the center of elution for each spot and 0 at each of the elutio n endpoints of each spot and were fit to a Gaussian curve. Example: the large dark blue spot (31, circled in blue in A) begins eluting at fraction 144 and ends at fraction 160; hence, at x=144, y=0, at x=160, y=10. Its is graphed in blue in part B.

GC/MS detection has significantly higher sensitivity, precision and resolution versus TLC. Derivatization, in this case, silylation, was performed to increase the detection of compounds in GC/MS. This is the common method to resolve the systematic exclusion of semi-volatile compounds, and allows the detection of as many compounds as possible. In order to conduct Pearson correlation analysis of GC/MS data with the deconvoluted biopeaks, GC/MS data also required data processing. GC/MS data were exported in sections of 700 retention time data points and calibrated based on the largest peaks within the series of fractions analyzed for each biopeak. This removed minimal differences between GC retention times in subsequent runs. When FCPC fraction chromatograms from GC/MS runs are tightly plotted together, peaks are formed for each retention time (Figure 50). To accomplish this, GC data were transposed and set as a three dimensional graph with FCPC fractions (x) versus GC intensity (y) and retention time going away from the viewer (z). Pearson correlations are analyzed to match the correlation between GC retention time peaks and bioactivity peaks. Since, each compound elutes from GC at a different retention time, an identical 185 match will indicate the presence of compound responsible for the biological activity. Pearson correlations were then graphed against GC retention time for each biopeak (Figures 51-53). The GC/MS chromatograms for the most active fractions within each biopeak range of FCPC fractions was then overlaid with the Pearson correlation plots in order to assign the active principles. Biochemometric characterization of biopeak 1 resulted in a 96% correlation with a large peak at a GC retention time just over 28 minutes (Figure 51). MS fragmentation pattern identified this peak as silylated ergosterol-5,8-endoperoxide. This confirmed compound 1 as the main bioactive constituent responsible for the anti-mycobacterial activity of biopeak 1. However, five other peaks in GC/MS had Pearson correlations greater than 90%, though none were as high as that of compound 1. The compound with a GC retention time of 25 minutes showed an MS fragmentation pattern that matched that of 2,3- dihydropropyl ester eicasanoic acid. This compound has not been previously reported to have anti-mycobacterial activity, but may warrant additional studies. The remaining four of these minor compounds have yet to be identified, and may have additional effect on the bioactivity of FCPC fractions in the biopeak 1 range, thus, they warrant further study. Biochemometric characterization of biopeak 2 resulted in an 81% correlation with a major peak at a GC retention time just over 19.5 minutes (Figure 52). MS fragmentation pattern identified this peak as 186 silylated linoleic acid. Another strong bioactivity having Pearson correlation (77%) was identified as a second large peak at a GC retention time of just over 21 minutes, but could not be identified by its MS fragmentation pattern. Linoleic acid has previously been reported to possess anti-mycobacterial activity, which corroborates the biochemometric findings, leading to the conclusion that it is the main bioactive constituent responsible for the anti-mycobacterial activity of biopeak 2. Biochemometric characterization of biopeak 3 resulted in an 88% correlation with a major peak at a GC retention time just over 20 minutes (Figure 53). MS fragmentation pattern identified this peak as silylated phytol. With previously reported anti-mycobacterial activity, phytol can be concluded as the main bioactive constituent responsible for the anti-mycobacterial activity of biopeak 3. The analysis of biopeak 3, however, highlights one of the caveats to the GC/MS biochemometric approach. In Figure 53, several Pearson correlations greater than 85% can be found at GC retention times without analyte peaks. This can be explained as random noise creating small peaks at GC retention times that have the same size and shape of the bioactivity peak. Since Pearson correlations do not factor in peak height, peaks created by noise are still recognized as correlations. With thousands of miniscule \"random noise peaks\", it is easy to predict Gaussian curves forming on GC retention times of subsequent runs. 187 However, by overlaying the GC/MS chromatogram of the most active fraction over the Pearson correlation results, it is clear that the noise- linked correlations can be ignored since they do not correlate with a detected compound (GC peak). 192 4.3.6.4. Discussion Biochemometric characterization of the crude fractions F-12-F14, led to the retrospective confirmation of 3 major anti-TB active constituents, ergosterol-5,8-endoperoxide ( 1), linoleic acid ( 3), and E- phytol ( 4). This supported the use of biochemometric characterization for the identification of active compounds in crude mixtures. Deconvolution of the biochromatogram from the FCPC fractionation of F12-F14 led to three independent bioactivity peaks. Semi-quantitative analysis through TLC detection proved valuable in the cases where active compounds are visibly detected. However, caveats to TLC analysis such as the use of an inappropriate reagent, compounds below the limit of detection and overlapping compounds on TLC apply to its use in biochemometric characterization. This method effectively identified and semi-quantitatively assigned active compounds in the analyses of TB- biopeaks 1 and 3. TB-biopeak 2, though, did not have strong Pearson correlations since the major active constituent, linoleic acid, was undetected in TLC at that level of fractionation due to the high concentration of overlapping compounds. The method still proved valuable in its ability to semi-quantitatively target spots that are responsible for bioactivity. With the additional knowledge of the compound class derived from spot characteristics, and the Rf value, further separation and isolation steps will be expedited. Semi- 193 quantitative biochemometric analysis using GC/MS of F12-F14 proved highly valuable to the identification of active constituents without isolation. With the GC/MS technique, active compounds were identified and semi-quantitatively assigned to each of the three TB-biopeaks. Since BGF of F12-F14 had previously been performed and the bioactivity of the isolates was evaluated with respect to the activity and weight ratio of their parent fractions and the crude extract, active isolates could be used to appraise the reliability of the biochemometric approach. The results demonstrated that biochemometric characterization quickly and accurately identified the major active constituents. In addition, several potential minor active constituents were identified in the GC chromatograms of active fractions. Future work should focus on isolating and testing these compounds. 4.4. CONCLUSIONS Phytochemical analysis of Dracaena angustifolia resulted in the isolation and elucidation of eight compounds. All of the isolated compounds had been previously identified from terrestrial plants. Ergosterol-5,8-endoperoxide( 1), linoleic acid ( 3), and trans -phytol ( 4) were highly active and showed MICs of 1, 2, and 1 \u00b5g/ml, respectively. Several of the inactive compounds, -sitosterol ( 6), sitostenone ( 8), and cholesterol ( 5) are common isolates identified in the BGF process conducted for anti-TB activity. This can be explained by their general 194 abundance in the non-polar fractions typically demonstrate the majority of the anti-TB activity. Since the cell wall of M. tuberculosis is highly lipophilic, large active compounds are accordingly lipophilic in order to pass into the cells and have an effect. None of these compounds had previously been isolated from D. angustifolia . While the three active compounds are fairly ubiquitious in the plant kingdom, they have never all three been isolated from the same plant before. This could be a result of the concentrations of the three compounds, or a methodological result due to the common practice of partitioning crude extracts with hexane to remove the highly lipophilic compounds. A common problem in BGF for anti-TB activity is sorting through these concentrated inactive compounds contained in active. The use of the hexane:MtBE:acetonitrile solvent system in the fractionation of F12-F14 proved highly valuable in separating these inactive compounds from the active constituents based on their partition coefficient. Additionally, a gradient array CCC method, maximizing the advantages of countercurrent chromatography over adsorption chromatography, was developed to expedite the isolation of biologically active constituents. Structures were mainly characterized through NMR spectroscopy enhanced with use of the ACD database and supplemented with GC/MS data. Anti-TB biological activity was evaluated on a semi-quantitative basis and confirmed that the three active constituents were responsible for the bioactivity of the parent fractions and crude extract. 195 Following the isolation of active constituents, the main crude fraction, was analyzed using the novel technique of biochemometric characterization. Since active compounds had been previously isolated as part of this study, active isolates could be used to appraise the reliability of the biochemometric approach. Results demonstrated that semi-quantitative biochemometric characterization, using GC/MS, efficiently identified the major active constituents accurately, as well as, several potentially active minor constituents. Semi-quantitative analysis using TLC could play a role in facilitating BGF work by establishing direct correlations between detected TLC spots and observed biological activity. Finally, the aforementioned phytochemical analysis of D. angustifolia exemplifies how modern analytical methods such as incorporating countercurrent chromatography can be successfully utilized in pharmacognostic investigations of biologically active natural products. 196 5. CONCLUSIONS 5.1. AIM 1: To assess and compare the levels of knowledge of the local flora to cultural, geographical and physical factors in an attempt to identify factors in maintaining indigenous knowledge Using the ethnobotanical notebook strategy, analysis of ethnobotanical knowledge among the indigenous population of Manus was undertaken to compare, contrast and identify factors in maintaining indigenous knowledge of the local flora. Statistical analysis of plant knowledge of informant groups showed that cultural subclass (favoring Usiai), gender (favoring men), and habitation locality (favoring those living in villages far from Lorengau town) are significant factors in maintaining indigenous ethnobotanical knowledge. However, results from studies such as this are always affected by the biases surrounding the methodology. For example, the gender difference among the Manus may lie in the interpretation of men, in general, who responded to the interviewer with a greater need to impress, while women often acted to expedite the interview process. Throughout the study it became clear that, even on the provincial level, significant cultural convergence and blending of idiosyncratic cultures have occurred. Based on the low levels of medicinal plant knowledge present among the Manus and the lack of significant differences among medicinal plant knowledge of all of the 197 informant groups studied, it can be stated that medicinal plant knowledge is particularly vulnerable to loss during the acculturation process. The practice of medicinal plant usage is being replaced by modern pharmaceuticals even though Western medicine is rarely available. This byproduct of the acculturation process among the Manus is a dangerous trend and has the potential to leave numerous indigenous inhabitants without ample medical care. Thus, despite the fact that Manus Province is the most geographically isolated province of Papua New Guinea, the project has demonstrated that acculturation has had detrimental effects on maintaining knowledge and customs. Finally, the Manus are only one example of an indigenous group that has lost significant medicinal plant knowledge; It is reasonable to speculate that globalization with these repercussions is occurring in numerous locations under similar circumstance. In addition, all traditional plant uses are documented in Appendix G. A copy of this dissertation serves as documentation of the traditional Manus ethnobotanical knowledge and will be returned to the community. 5.2. A IM 2: To document the indigenous pharma copoeia for respiratory ailments of Manus Province, Papua New Guinea. Semi-structured ethnobotanical interviews focused on the treatment of respiratory ailments were conducted in eight villages and 198 Lorengau town with 45 indigenous participants in Manus Province. In the search for anti-TB treatments, the strategy was chosen to document plants used for all respiratory ailments, this include, but was not limited to cough, asthma, and shortness of breath. Plants were taxonomically identified and voucher specimens are used to document plant species. Results indicated 43 species of plants identified as being used to treat respiratory ailments in Manus Province. 5.3. AIM 3: To evaluate the model that informa nt consensus from ethnomedical studies predicts the potential for biological activity. Comparisons were made of indigenous plant knowledge, in the form of informant responses in ethnobotanical interviews, with subsequent biological testing in a relevant anti-TB in vitro assay. Analyses, indicated that the model of informant consensus, which attempts to predict that the higher the relative frequency of a species mentioned for a specific illness, the greater will be the potential for containing pharmacologically active constituents, is inaccurate in predicting anti-mycobacterial activity in the TB-related ethnopharmacological pharmacopoeia of Manus Island, Papua New Guinea. However, due to the complexity of the human body, it cannot be assumed that in vitro bioassay results translate to human systems, namely, clinical activity, for either a positive or negative result. 199 Consequently, the plant species identified in the survey may be beneficial in the treatment of TB for many reasons apart from direct anti- mycobacterial activity; e.g., they may provide symptomatic relief from cough or have immunostimulatory effects. To date, there are no examples of significant studies where a higher relative frequency value of a species as a result of ethnopharmacological interviews has shown specific correlation with biological activity. Thus, ethnopharmacologists should recognize the level of assumption that coincides with conclusions based on prioritization of plant species based on informant consensus. 5.4. AIM 4: To characterize and phytochemically identify a high priority Manusian ethnobotanical with the A crude extract of Dracaena angustifolia Roxb. (Dracaenaceae) leaves was determined to possess a strong in vitro anti-mycobacterial activity. Since no phytochemical studies had been conducted on D. angustifolia leaves, this plant was selected for full phytochemical analysis. BGF of D. angustifolia resulted in the isolation, characterization and quantification of three major anti-TB active compounds, ergosterol-5,8-endoperoxide( 1), linoleic acid ( 3) and phytol (4). These compounds along with five additional compounds, phytene- 1,2-diol ( 2), ( 7), and sitostenone ( 8), were isolated through a series of chromatographic separations guided by biological testing. Several of the inactive compounds, or compounds of these types, are common among BFG studies using in vitro assays. One of the key elements in the isolation of the biologically active compounds was the use of a gradient array CCC method, which maximizes the advantages of countercurrent chromatography over adsorption chromatography. Structures were characterized through NMR spectroscopy and queried in the ACD database and finally supplemented with GC/MS data. 5.5. AIM 5: To evaluate newly developed biochemometric methodology in its potential to identify and correlate active constituents from a crude plant fraction. Biochemometric characterization is currently being developed in our laboratory as a novel method to correlate active constituents from crude mixtures, without requiring lengthy BGF. Since active compounds of D. angustifolia had been isolated and the bioactivity of the isolates was evaluated with respect to the activity and weight ratio of their parent fractions and the crude extract, active isolates could be used to appraise the suitability of this approach. The main crude fraction of D. angustifolia was analyzed using the novel technique of biochemometric characterization. Results demonstrated that semi-quantitative 201 biochemometric characterization using GC/MS, quickly and effectively identified the major active constituents. Semi-quantitative analysis through TLC detection proved valuable in the cases where active compounds are visibly detected. However, caveats to TLC analysis such as the use of an inappropriate reagent, compounds below the limit of detection and overlapping compounds on TLC apply to its use in biochemometric characterization. 5.6. AIM 6: To assess the experimental results from aims 1-5 and develop an integrated approach for future anti-TB drug discovery from ethnobotanicals. The current study utilized several new and diverse methods and analyses designed to streamline the process of tuberculosis drug discovery from ethnopharmacological leads. In aims 1-3, the ethnobotanical notebook strategy allowed for the identification of cultural, geographical and physical factors within the Manus community the retained high levels of ethnobotanical knowledge. Further analyses of the data set, supplemented with records from semi-structured interviews, led to conclusions on the lack of reliability of the informant consensus model in ethnopharmacological claims for the treatment of tuberculosis. The findings and analyses from the fieldwork portion of the 202 current study help to improve future ethnopharmacological work focused on tuberculosis. In the laboratory, several new techniques were developed to expedite anti-tuberculosis drug discovery from plants. These included gradient-array countercurrent chromatography, biochemometric characterization and structural elucidation enhanced of the ACD database. Using partition-based countercurrent chromatography for crude extract fractionation, separations were made without suffering sample loss, and, therefore, eliminating the chances of activity loss related to chromatography procedures. To compensate for the disadvantage of CCC separations being focused on a narrow window of polarity, the gradient-array approach was utilized. This provided high- resolution separations, spread along the polarity range, equal to that of traditional adsorption chromatography. Additionally, use of the hexane:MtBE:acetonitrile solvent system in the fractionation of the main active anti-TB fraction proved highly valuable due to its ability to segregate commonly isolated inactive compounds from active constituents. Following isolation, compounds were dereplicated and structurally elucidated with the help of the ACD database. By searching experimental chemical shifts in comparison to those in the database, starting points for compound identification were easily achieved. Then, 203 using traditional approaches to dissect and associate parts of the spectroscopic data, compound identities could be confirmed. Since several of the compounds presented are commonly found in anti-TB natural products drug discovery projects, appendix X has been added as a supplementary document to facilitate rapid dereplication of the compounds presented. By condensing key identification and isolation characteristics this will facilitate direct recognition of their presence in future projects and prevent time wasted on overlapping work. After compounds were isolated and their relative bioactivity was evaluated to that of the crude extract, a crude active fraction was analyzed using biochemometric characterization. This technique was evaluated for its ability to correlate biological activity with individually detected chemical constituents. This proved successful in the dereplication of the three active compounds, which had previously been identified through lengthy BGF. Future use of this technique will allow for the identification of potentially active compounds without isolation. The implications of these new methods and analyses provide for an efficient integrated approach for future anti-TB drug discovery from ethnopharmacological leads. 5.7. O VERALL CONCLUSIONS Whether in the form of new drug compounds or safe and effective herbal therapies, it has been shown that new inexpensive therapies for 204 tuberculosis are greatly needed. Through the study of traditional ethnobotanical treatments of tuberculosis, there is a high potential for the discovery of new therapeutic agents that will lessen the global TB burden. The current study attempted to prove whether or not plants identified for the treatment of tuberculosis by the local population of Manus Province, Papua New Guinea would show correlating biological activity and that active chemical entities could be isolated from these plants. By combining the investigation of indigenous knowledge and cutting-edge natural products chemistry, 43 species of plants showing various levels of anti-TB activity were identified. One of these plants, Dracaena angustifolia , was phytochemically investigated and supplied three highly active anti-TB compounds. Concurrently, the development and testing of new methods and analyses in the fields of ethnobotany and phytochemistry have allowed a broader contribution to efforts in establishing safe and effective anti-TB treatments from traditional medicines. 205 6.

Pauli 833 South Wood Street Chicago, Illinois 60612 USA Phone: 312-996-5607 Dr. Guido F. Pauli: 312-355-1949 Why am I being asked? You are invited to be a subject in a resear ch study about medici nal plants of Manus Province and Manusian medical beliefs and he rbal treatments conducted by Ryan Case, a graduate student at the University of I llinois at Chicago. You have been asked to participate in this research because you ar e a resident of the Manus Province in Papua New Guinea and may be eligible to participat e. We ask that you read this form and ask any questions you may have before ag reeing to be in the research. Your participation in this research is voluntary. Your decision whether or not to participate will not affect your cu rrent or future relations with the University of Illinois at Chicago or the University of Papua New Guinea. If you decide to participate, you are free to withdraw at any time wit hout affecting that relationship. Why is this research being done? The purpose of this research is to learn wh at you know about medicinal plants of Manus Province, for what illness you use these he rbs, and what you believe are causes of disease. I would like to ask you questions to learn if you have ever used medicinal plants to treat disease. If so, which plant do you us e, for what illness, how do you use them, and how have you learned to use them. I may coll ect samples of the plants you mention and take them back to the laboratories at The University of Papua New Guinea or The University of Illinois to see if they kill the f ungus, bacteria, or parasite that is believed to be the cause of the illness you mention. If you agree to be in this research, I will ask you to answer a list of questions about the illnesses you suffer from, your beliefs about the cause of these illnesses, and what you do to treat them. The formal interview w ill take about 40 minutes of your time. Appendix E (continued) 258 What is the purpose of this research? The purpose of this research is to learn how you use medicinal plants in Manus Province. What procedures are involved? If you agree to be in this re search, I will ask you to answer a list of questions about the plants of Manus Province and any uses of these plants for medicinal purposes. The formal interview will take about 40 minutes of your time. This Prior Informed Consent document is only valid for one interview. If a follow up/subsequent interviews are requested by the researcher, you will be asked to sign an additional Informed Consent document. If you do not wish to be contacted for subsequent interviews please mark the box at the end of this document. Approximately 40 people may be involved in this research. What are the potential risks and discomforts? The possible risks, I foresee, may be disc omfort in sharing personal knowledge about illnesses and the important plants you use to treat them. If, at any time, any question makes you feel uncomfortable you do not have to answer it. If sharing secret knowledge about plants or other trea tments makes you feel uncomfortable, you do not have to continue with the interview and you may wit hdraw at any time. Please remember that you do not have to share any knowledge or part icipate in anything that makes you feel uncomfortable. Are there benefits to taking part in the research? There are no direct benefits to the research participants. The written documentation of local Manusian knowledge of local plants and ot her treatments used to cure them, will be organized in the form of a manual so that the information will not be lost and younger Manusians can continue to lear n from their Manusian traditions. Also, this manual can be given to doctors, nurses, and visitors from other cultures that may not know about the beliefs you have and the plants you use. What other options are there? Your participation in this research is voluntary, it is your choice. If you decide to participate, you are free to stop participating at any time. You may also refuse to answer any questions that you do not want to answer and still participate in this research. You will be given a copy of this form and should keep it for your records.

In this way, your name will be kept secret wh ile the data is being studied. The written notes from all interviews will also be kept locked, and only I will have access to them. All audiotapes will be destroyed within two years of the transcription of the interview to assure anonymity. Can I withdraw or be removed from the study? You can choose whether to be in this study or not. If you volunteer to be in this study, you may withdraw at any time without conseque nces of any kind. You may also refuse to answer any questions you don't want to answer and still remain in the study. The investigator may withdraw you from this research if circ umstances arise which warrant doing so. Who should I contact if I have questions? The researcher conducting this study is Ryan Case.
