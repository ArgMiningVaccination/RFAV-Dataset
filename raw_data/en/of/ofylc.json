Data also shows that unvaccinated individuals are at the greatest risk of spreading COVID-19, severe illness, and death,\" said Department of Public Health and Social Services (DPHSS) Director Art San Agustin. Guam aims to vaccinate at least 80% of its adult population against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, to achieve \"population immunity.\" Population immunity is the protection a community gains against an infectious disease when a high proportion of the population is immune to the disease, either through vaccination or immunity developed through previous infection. One of the aims of working towards population immunity is to keep vulnerable groups who cannot get vaccinated (e.g., due to health conditions like allergic reactions to the vaccine) safe and protected from the disease. In 2021, 92% of COVID-19 cases and all COVID-19-related deaths were among unvaccinated people on Guam. The island's current vaccination rate has reduced the number of cases and hospitalizations due to COVID-19, but more needs to be done. By ethnicity, the vaccination data show gaps in vaccination rates. According to DPHSS vaccination data, less than one-half (43%) of Chamorros are fully vaccinated, and less than one-third (30%) of Chuukese are fully vaccinated. For other Pacific Islander groups, the data shows Yapese at 64%, Palauans Marshallese at 34%. Asian groups on Guam have higher vaccination rates: Koreans at 73%, Chinese at 72%, Filipinos at 71%, and Japanese at 56%. DPHSS relies on ethnicity data to identify health disparities for focused interventions and community outreach. Current ethnicity data shows that Chamorros (42%), Filipinos (29%), and other Pacific Islanders (13%) (e.g., Micronesians) comprise the majority (84%) of Guam's total population. Age Groups COVID-19 vaccination data as of July 14, 2021, show that Guam is doing well in vaccinating those over 50 years of age. Guam has successfully fully vaccinated over 80% of people ages 50-74 years, 72% of those ages 40-49, and 69% of those over age 75. Vaccination turnout has been low among the younger age groups: 30-39 years (57% fully vaccinated), 18-29 years (52% fully vaccinated), and eligible pre-teens and teens ages 12-17 (39% fully vaccinated). The estimated proportion of the population vaccinated for COVID-19 by ethnicity is based on 2020 population projections from the Guam Statistical Yearbook (Guam Bureau of Statistics and Plans, 2018). Until the 2020 U.S. Census data for Guam are released, estimated populations are being utilized. DPHSS compiles data on COVID-19 vaccinations for Guam's civilian population via a secure health program called Guam Immunization Registry, or GuamWebIZ. Results: Four New Cases of COVID-19 Four (4) new cases of COVID-19 were identified out of 290 tests performed on July 15. Two (2) cases were identified through contact tracing. To date, there have been a total of 8,477 officially reported cases of COVID-19 with 142 deaths, 111 cases in active isolation, and 8,224 not in active isolation. The CAR Score is 0.7. Operation Liberate Guam update: To date, a total of 93,404 or 77.81% of adults have received either both doses in the two-dose series (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) or the single-dose series (Johnson & Johnson/Janssen) of the COVID-19 vaccine.
