Pathway Entry Requirements Recruitment to Specialist anaesthesi ology training (SAT) is through the College of Anaesthes iologists of Ireland (CAI) centralised appointm ent process only. Candidates must be eligible for the Trainee Division of the Medical Council Register at the time of application and fulfil all other requirements. Duration & Organisation of Training The six years of Anaesthesi ology training is based in a ccredited hospitals. Training is structured to maximise opportunities for learning and to provide a broad range of experience in different types of hospitals and of different sub -specialties in Anaesthesi ology . Training comprises a combination of practical experience, clinical learning, theoretical learning, learning in non -clinical areas, individual study, and mandatory elements including simulation courses. . Training will be subject to close supervision and trainees will be subject to assessment and form al examination throughout their training and are expected to record their clinical practice and academic activities through the CAI e-Portfolio for Training system. . Progression through the six year programme will depend upon achieving certain milestones, and competencies, and these will be reviewed through formal CAI interviews arranged by the Training Department . Training will not be considered complete until after a formal review has taken place, this will then lead to the granting of a CS CST. Followin g completion of the programme trainees can apply for a consultant role in Anaesthesi ology . Trainees also have the opportunity to sub specialise in a number of sub specialties including the award of a dual CS CST in either Pain Medicine or Intensive Care Med icine . Medical Disciplines , Specialties and Training Pathways |2021 2 Created by the office of the DMHG NDTP Training Leads Intensive Care Medicine Description Intensive care medicine (ICM) is a new specialty arising from developments in medical treatment and technology aimed at treating acute organ failure. ICM involves prompt and careful patient assessment, resuscita tion and on -going treatment, and close integration with many other specialties. The Intensive Care doctor's job entails the ongoing management of organ support, the interpretation of the patient's response to treatments and communication - mainly with the relatives of the critically ill patient. Most specialists in ICM (called intensivists) train first in another specialty and then attain higher specialist training in ICM before appointment to a Critical Care hospital team. College of Anaesthe siologists of Ireland, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, Intensive Care Society of Ireland - collectively forming the 'Joint Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine of Ireland' Pathway The Joint Faculty, on behalf of the College, supports Specialist Anaesthesiology Trainees to develop their practice of Intensive Care Medicine during their training programme. The College has set down certain minimum standards regarding duration and structure of training in Intensive Care Medicine. All trainees should complete six months of structured, supervised training in intensive care medicine. This should be modular in format comprising at least one 2 -month module in an ICU recognized for training for the Diploma of the Irish Board of Intensiv e Care Medicine (DIBICM). The DIBICM examination is under the auspices of the Joint Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine of Ireland (JFICMI). Pain Medicine Description Pain Medicine is practised internationally on a multidisciplinary basis informed by the latest developments in neuroscience. It involves the treatment of acute pain (pain less than 3 month's duration) - classically postoperative pain in the hospital setting and chronic pain (pain of 3 -6 months duration) in a variety of settings depending on the aetiology of the pain. Pathway Consultant in Pain Medicine (Level 2) OR Consultant with a sub -specialty interest in Pain Management (Level 1) For Anaesthesiology Trainees: Step 1 (Post FCAI or MCAI*) You will need 6 months modular training and completion of the Exam: DPMCAI (post 2012) *DPMCAI only conferred after FCAI passed Step 2 (1 yr Special Interest Year (SAT) Level 1 Consultant with sub -specialty interest in Pain Management Medical Disciplines , Specialties and Training Pathways |2021 3 Created by the office of the DMHG NDTP Training Leads Needs to have completed the requirements of the training programme in Anaesthesiology.

Medical Disciplines , Specialties and Training Pathways |2021 4 Created by the office of the DMHG NDTP Training Leads 2. Emergency Medicine (Irish Committee for E mergency Medicine Training) Emergency Medicine Description Emergency Medicine is a field of practice based on the knowledge and skills required for the prevention, diagnosis and management of acute and urgent aspects of illness and injury affecting patients of all age groups with a full spectrum of undifferentiated physical and behavioural disorders. It further encompasses an understanding of the development of pre -hospital and in - hospital emergency medical systems and the skills necessary for this d evelopment. Pathway Core Specialist Training in Emergency Medicine (CSTEM) is a 3 -year programme consisting of a series of relevant posts at Non -Consultant Hospital Doctor (NCHD) level that lay the professional groundwork for subsequent specialisation. Dur ing this time, doctors obtain a wide range of experience in a variety of specialties, structured as 6 -month posts: Year 1 Emergency Medicine Trauma & Orthopaedic Surgery or Plastic Surgery or Acute Medicine Year 2 Paediatric Emergency Medicine (PEM) or Acu te General Paediatrics Emergency Medicine Year 3 Anaesthesia and/or Critical Care Medicine (CCM) Emergency Medicine EM posts on CSTEM are restricted to those Emergency Departments (EDs) inspected and recognised for CSTEM. A nominated trainer in each depart ment will act as educational supervisor for CSTEM trainees in that unit - the CSTEM lead trainer. EDs recognised for CSTEM are: Adelaide and Meath incorporating the National Children's Hospital, Tallaght, Dublin Beaumont Hospital, Dublin Cavan General Hosp ital Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown, Dublin Cork University Hospital Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin Midlands Regional Hospital, Tullamore Medical Disciplines , Specialties and Training Pathways |2021 5 Created by the office of the DMHG NDTP Training Leads Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin Our of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda Sligo General Hospital St. James's Hospital, Dublin St. Vincent's University Hospital, Dublin Temple Street University Hospital University Hospital Galway University Hospital Limerick University Hospital Waterford Paediatric Emergency Medicine (Not Recognised) Description Paediatric emergency care in Ireland is delivered in facilities ranging from departments staffed with consultants in PEM and PEM -trained nurses 24/7 to care delivered in areas in smaller hospitals staffed by local paediatricians and general nur sing staff. There is wide geographical variation in the acute and urgent service provided to children and young people and in this document the following definitions are used: The term Paediatric Emergency Department in this document is used to describe departments governed by consultants in PEM and PEM -trained nurses, and staffed by paediatric and emergency medicine trainees who provide services 24/7. The term Paediatric Medical Emergency Area is used to describe rooms or areas in local or regional hospi tals governed by general paediatricians and staffed by paediatric trainees The term Emergency Department is used to describe a facility where adults and children attend 24 hours a day governed by Emergency Medicine specialists and trainees. Pathway Speci alty Training in Paediatric Emergency Medicine Currently PEM is not a recognised specialty in the Register of Medi cal Specialists in Ireland. The Specialty has been formally recognised in the UK by the General Medi cal Council in recent years and In North A merica and Australasia for significantly longer. There exists a precedent in Ireland where by PEM might be recognised as a specialty i.e. Paediatric Cardiology is a recognised subspecialty of Paediatrics and has a similar number of specialists currently in practice. The existing route to specialty training and accreditation in PEM and ultimately employment as a Consultant in PEM in Ireland has been through the achievement of a Certificate of Completion of Training (CCT) in Emergency Medicine with one year's additional tr aining, typically including six months dedicated PEM and six months of ward -based paediatrics, of which at least three months would include Paediatric Intensive Care (PIC).This route has been prev iously ratified as satisfactory by the College of Emergency Medicine when considering the is sue of run -through training and Modernising Medical Careers. Medical Disciplines , Specialties and Training Pathways |2021 6 Created by the office of the DMHG NDTP Training Leads However, trainees in General Paediatrics have been disa dvantaged by these pre -existing arrangements. While it has been possible for a trainee with a CCT in paediatrics to obtain a Consultant post in PEM in Ireland, this was only possible if that traine e qualified to apply for such a post through an 'experiential' route: mandatory requirements woul d be at least seven years post registration clinical ex perience, with at least four years clinical EM experience and two years in paediatric -related specialties. The continuation of this position wil l pose obvious problems for any paediatric Specialist Registrar(SpR)withaspirationstopur sueacareerinPEM.TheRCPCH (UK)has gone some way to offering clarity and guidance for trainees and there is acceptance that an additional two years of PEM -focused training is sufficient to gain subspecialty accreditation in PEM.

The CSCST allows entry onto the General Practitioners Specialist Register o f the Irish Medical Council. Type of Work Medical Disciplines , Specialties and Training Pathways |2021 8 Created by the office of the DMHG NDTP Training Leads A general practitioner is a medical graduate who gives personal, primary, and continuing care to individuals, families and a practice population, irrespective of age, gender and illness; it is the synthesis of thes e functions which is unique. A GP will: Attend patients in consulting rooms, in patients' homes and sometimes in clinics/hospital settings. Their aim is to make early diagnosis. Include and integrate physical, psychological, and social factors in their con siderations about health and illness. This will be expressed in their care of patients. Make an initial decision about every problem which is presented to them as a doctor. Undertake the continuing treatment of patients which chronic, recurrent, or termina l illness. Prolonged contact means that the GP can use repeated opportunities to gather information at a pace appropriate to each patient and build up a relationship of trust, which can be used professionally. Practice in co -operation with other colleagues , medical and non -medical. Know when and how to intervene through treatment, prevention and education, to promote the health of patients and their families. Recognise that they also have a professional responsibility to the community Parallel with training , four modules of the MICGP Examination must be undertaken. These modules are usually spread over the training period. Military Medicine Description Military Medicine constitutes the art and science of medicine as practiced in the Defence Forces or other military environments. It is a composite specialty, rooted in general practice and occupational medicine, embracing a wide variety of skills and knowledge, applicable both in the on -island and deployed setting, with the primary goal of contributing to the success of the mission. Practitioners are required to work in a unique socio -cultural environment with its own command structure but are also required to adhere to the traditional ethical principles of medical practice. Pathway Initial Specialist Training This phase is conducted over two years. Trainees are commissioned into the Permanent Defence Forces (PDF) in the rank of Lieutenant and are released to rotate through hospital posts in medicine, paediatrics, emergency medicine, psychiatry and an optional p lacement in another suitable post. Trainees also undergo basic military induction, conducted over week -long periods in the Defence Forces Training Centre (DFTC) in the Curragh.

Entry Requirements for Higher Specialist Trai ning in Cardiology Applicants for Higher Specialist Training (HST) in Cardiology must have completed a minimum of two years Basic Specialist Training (BST) in approved posts and obtained the MRCPI or (UK*). Duration & Organisation of Training The six years of HST in Cardiology is intended to produce fully trained Cardiologists who will follow one of two paths (Path 1 or Path 2). The decision as to which path to follow will be made after 4 years of Basic Cardiology, which all trainees will complete. The trai ning period shall be so arranged that during basic training (i.e. first four years), trainees will be provided with the opportunity to gain experience in the minimum number of procedures as required: Path 1 will lead to certification in Cardiology (CSCST) with acknowledgement of additional training having been undertaken in a subspecialty of Cardiology which will be identified on the certificate issued. Medical Disciplines , Specialties and Training Pathways |2021 15 Created by the office of the DMHG NDTP Training Leads Path 2 will lead to Dual accreditation in Cardiology and General Internal Medicine, utilising the time allocated to subspecialty training during Path 1 (above), to obtain the additional training needed for completion of the GIM curricular requirements The importance to the practising Cardiologist of an adequate training in General Medicine is acknowledged by the inclusion in the General Cardiology Curriculum of a mandatory year of GIM. It must also be recognised that Specialist Cardiologists, to a greater extent than most other Medical Specialists, need to develop certain additional highly technical skills and competencies. Their capacity to acquire such skills cannot be ascertained prior to entry into HST. As a result, trainees are not asked to decide from the outset which of the two training paths they will eventually follow . All trainees are enrolled initia lly in General (Internal) Medicine as well as in Cardiology. Then, based on the results of assessments of progress made annually, and particularly on an assessment made during the latter part of basic training a decision is made prior to the commencement o f a fifth year of training, enabling the General Internal Medicine CSCST option to be dropped Clinical Genetics Description Clinical Genetics deals with the diagnosis and management of inherited disorders and birth defects, with the estimation of genetic risks and with genetic counselling of family members. Genetic disorders can affect people of all ages and involve all body systems. Clinical genetic specialists work in multidisciplinary regional genetic centres with laboratory scientists, clinical co -workers and academic colleagues. The specialty is constantly changing and specialists must take account of new developments and alter clinical practice accordingly. Communication skills are particularly important in explaining complex concepts and genetic tes t results to families enabling them to make informed decisions. Pathway BST (Basic Specialist Training Medical Pathway) See Cardiology for Medical BST Pathway Higher Specialty Training In Clinical Genetics Entry Requirements The training pathway to become a Clinical Geneticist starts with Basic Specialist Training (BST) in General Internal Medicine (GIM). BST in GIM is a common training programme for people who wish to specialise as Physicians in Ireland. The program is two years long and trainees have the opportunity to experience a number of specialties during this time. Medical Disciplines , Specialties and Training Pathways |2021 16 Created by the office of the DMHG NDTP Training Leads A BST Certificate is awarded to all those who successfully complete the two year programme. Candidates who have a qualification which is deemed equivalent are also eligible to apply for higher specialist training in Clinical Genetics. Duration and Organisation of Training The Clinical Genetics Higher Specialist Training programme is 4 years in duration. Higher Specialist Training in Clinical Genetics includes clinical, laboratory and theoretical work. Trainees will gain an understanding of the investigation, diagnosis and management of inborn errors of metabolism (IMD) and the principles of new -born screening. Trainees should be competent in the diagnosis of an IMD with familiarity with treatment of management of common conditions such as PKU, organic acidopathies, urea cycle defects, lysosomal disorders and the modalities of treatment (substrate reduction, organ and HSCT/stem cell transplantation, chaperone and substrate inhibitor treatments, enzyme replacement therapy and the principles of gene therapy and gene manipulation therapies.) The majority of trainees will be expected to have undertaken a supervised research project by the end of their training. Clinic al Genetics Research Module : Trainees may also choose to follow the academic training pathway will be required to meet additional objectives. After entering an approved programme, some trainees wish to spend a longer period in research by stepping aside f rom clinical training for up to three years. This is dependent on the research being prospectively approved by the College and with the support of the NSD and Dean of Postgraduate Specialist Training. Clinical Neurophysiology Description Clinical Neurophy siology is a branch of the neurosciences which is concerned with the investigation of neurological disease by techniques, which depend upon the electrical properties of neural tissue and muscle. The specialty is primarily involved with the diagnosis of ner ve entrapments, neuromuscular disease, epilepsy and ophthalmological disease. It increasingly includes the intra - operative monitoring of the integrity of the spinal cord during scoliosis surgery. Other uses include mapping of the cortex during epilepsy sur gery and localisation of the subthalamic nuclei for surgery for Parkinsons Disease and tremor.

Duration The duration of HST in Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics is 4 years, one year of which may be gained from a period of full -time research. Those who wish to obtain dual certification in Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics and General Internal Medicine will require at least a fifth year of training. Training Programme The training programme offered will provide opportunities to fulfil all the requirements of the curriculum of training for the Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics programme in accredited training hospitals. Each post within the programme will have a named trainer/educational supervisor and programmes will be under the direction of the National Specialty Director(s) for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics. Programmes will be as flexible as p ossible consistent with curricular requirements, for example to allow the trainee to develop a sub -specialty interest. The experience gained through rotation around different departments is recognised as an essential part of HST. It is preferable that a Sp R does not remain in the same unit for longer than 2 years of clinical training or with the same trainer for more than 1 year. However, given that Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics is a small speciality, there is flexibility in this respect and a trai nee will mostly likely spend 2 years with the same trainer. How to Apply The recruitment and selection process for Higher Specialist Training (HST) opens in November every year. The deadline to submit an application for HST is normally the last working day in November, with interviews for shortlisted candidates taking place the following February and March.

To achieve these goals, the trainee must have ready access to advice from a consultant at all times, both in the outpatient department and on the ward. During the first year, the trainee must obtain a solid grounding in the subject and well -defined goals are set for this period. Thereafter, the training requirements become more flexible. Endocrinology & Diabetes Mellitus Description Endocrinology & Diabet es Mellitus is a predominantly clinical specialty dealing with diseases of the endocrine glands as they affect people of all ages. Besides the pathophysiological processes involved and the physical impact of each condition, psycho -social effects must also be understood.

ICM involves prompt and careful patient assessment, resuscitation and on -going treatment, and close integration with many oth er specialties. The Intensive Care doctor's job entails the ongoing management of organ support, the interpretation of the patient's response to treatments and communication - mainly with the relatives of the critically ill patient. Most specialists in ICM (called intensivists) train first in another specialty and then attain higher specialist training in ICM before appointment to a Critical Care hospital team. Medical Disciplines , Specialties and Training Pathways |2021 31 Created by the office of the DMHG NDTP Training Leads Pathway Higher Specialty Training in Intensive Care Medicine a) Current Training pathways and regula tions Year 1 of specialty ICM training is characterised by the acquisition of the competencies specified within the curriculum, technical and procedural expertise (see Logbook / Procedures) and success at a summative Fellowship exam (Written, Clinical plu s Viva) which is undertaken (FJFICMI) at the end of year 1. Intensive Care training at Year 1 may be achieved as a special interest year (SIY) in ICM, as per the established CAI training programme. Completion of Year 1 shall be in the senior years of advan ced training for all base specialties (ie. SAT 5/6 for anaesthesia trainees and equivalent for other base specialties). Where this year of intensive care training is not completed within the anaesthesia or other training programme, the trainee will need to complete 2 years of ICM training post base specialty CSCST. During year 2 of specialty training, there is no further exam in ICM but publications / project or other accreditation (for example in critical care echocardiography) is required - as is suitabl e to a pre - consultant year of training. Competencies to be attained are as outlined in the JFICMI Curriculum document, with a particular focus on professionalism, and clinical leadership. By the end of training, year 2 trainees will have completed 24 months of dedicated ICM training to include: Completion of all the 12 domains of ICM competency Basic Critical Care echocardiography competence Attendance at a BASIC course Attendance at an IDAP (Donor Awareness Programme) course Completion of a prospectively approved audit or research project with associated presentations and publication(s) Specific advanced training in critical care echocardiography or extra -corporeal life support (ECLS) training and accreditation or an alternative pathway to research (duration of training would preclude satisfactory completion of both research and specific advanced training modules). b) Current Training Outcomes and Career Structure: The successful comple tion of one year of ICM training (as above), which includes success at the FJFICMI exam, allows eligibility (in Ireland) for a 'consultant with a special interest in ICM' position provided also that CSCST in base specialty is achieved. This career option i s only utilised / available in Anaesthesia at present. The successful completion of a pre -approved second 'supra -specialist' year of ICM training (see guidance above) will allow accreditation as a completed trainee in ICM. Such status will allow eligibili ty for specialist registration in ICM with the Medical Council of Ireland and eligibility to apply for a Consultant in Intensive Care Medicine position .

Essential Training: Trainees must attend study days as advised by the National Speciality Director. During the initial two ye ars of training the trainee must acquire a sound theoretical knowledge of cancer biology and the scientific principles of therapy. Simultaneously the trainee must acquire basic clinical skills in the non -surgical management of cancer. Dominant among these will be the use of chemotherapy, aspects of palliative care including symptom control, the common complications of malignancy and the common side -effects associated with cancer therapy. The trainee must also learn good communication skills and the capacity to educate the patient regarding his/her illness. A basic understanding of radiotherapy both radical and palliative should be acquired. This should include dosing, scheduling, clinical indications, limitations and short -term and long -term toxicities. This should be achieved by working jointly with radiati on oncologist in a multidisciplinary setting. The final 2 years of training will allow trainees to extend the range and depth of experience and knowledge. Trainees should have more primary responsibility for patient care with a relaxation of consultant su pervision. Recording of further experience and skills should take place in the training record and, where areas of weakness in training to date exist, deficiencies should be corrected. To allow trainees to develop specialist interests, site -specialisation experience should be an integral part of this phase of training.

Palliative Medicine specialists provide care directly to patients with complex needs related to life -limiting disease, and support other doctors in providing care for patients with life -limiting illnesses with non -complex palliative care needs Pathway BST (Basic Specialist Training Medical Pathway) See Cardiology for Medical BST Pathway Higher Specialty Training in Palliative Medicine Medical Disciplines , Specialties and Training Pathways |2021 37 Created by the office of the DMHG NDTP Training Leads Entry Requirements Applicants for Higher Specialist Training (HST) in Palliative Medicine must have a certificate of completion in Basic Specialist Training (BST) in General Internal Medicine and obtained the MRCPI. Duration & Organ isation of Training The four years of HST in Palliative Medicine are intended to produce fully trained Palliative Medicine physicians. The programmes will be flexible and designed to give opportunity for experience of the various settings in which palliati ve medicine is practised, i.e. in specialist palliative care units, in hospitals or other major centres with academic activity, and community based settings. It is essential that a period of three years full time is spent in clinical practice in specialist palliative care units or teams where a full range of services are provided in different settings, two years of which must be in specialist palliative care units. The experience gained through rotation around different departments is recognised as an esse ntial part of HST. A Specialist Registrar may not remain in the same unit for longer than 2 years of clinical training; or with the same trainer for more than 1 year. Where an essential element of the curriculum is missing from a programme, access to it should be arranged, by day release for example, or if necessary by secondment. One year of training may be spent in posts in general medicine or other relevant speciali ties e.g. medical oncology, radiation oncology, infectious diseases, haematology, geriatric medicine, pain management or general practice, provided such posts are approved for higher medical training. The programme to which trainees are appointed will hav e named consultant trainers for each slot in the programme. The Institute of Medicine will appoint a national co -ordinator for training within each speciality (National Specialty Director for Palliative Medicine).

Other entrants with appropriate higher examinations (including MICGP, MRCSI) may be considered. All applicants must be employed in a position that is within a na tional regulatory agency such as the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) or a Pharmaceutical Company e.g. Pfizer. The applicant's employment location must be listed as an approved training site for Pharmaceutical Medicine. Applicants to the trainin g programme must be supported by their employer organisation and will be required to supply evidence of this at application stage. Those that do not hold a BST Certificate and MRCPI must provide evidence of equivalency. Entry on the training programme is at year 1. Deferrals are not allowed on entry to the Higher Specialty Training Programme. Duration and Organisation of Training Whilst the curriculum is competency -based, the duration of training must meet the European minimum of 4 years for full -time sp eciality training adjusted accordingly for flexible training. The programme has a modular structure, which takes into account the major areas of competence required by the pharmaceutical medicine (PM) specialist. There are 6 core modules, in addition to the generic components module. Trainees must complete each of these core modules during their period of training. In addition, each trainee must complete a postgraduate course (diploma / MSc) in pharmaceutical medicine / drug development sciences, by the e nd of year 3 of the training programme (see figure 1). This is funded by the trainee's employer or self -funded. This will enable trainees to demonstrate that they have a broad understanding of the various areas of pharmaceutical medicine and its overarchin g public health role in the promotion of the rational use of medicines. The curriculum incorporates the European harmonised curriculum for pharmaceutical medicine, formally approved by the European Commission recognised Innovative Medicines Initiative Joi nt Undertaking (IMI JU) PharmaTrain project and by the UK Faculty of Pharmaceutical Medicine. Each trainee will complete a 4 -year training programme, in order to acquire practical competency -based training. Trainees in the Pharmaceutical Medicine HST prog ramme are encouraged to spend time in research. However due to the nature of the specialty there is no period of research or out of programme experience that will count towards the completion of the training program. Many of the core programme modules alre ady incorporate significant research elements. If trainees express an interest in undertaking research during the training programme they can do as part of the specialty Medical Disciplines , Specialties and Training Pathways |2021 39 Created by the office of the DMHG NDTP Training Leads module: New Medicines Development. The Pharmaceutical Medicine NSD and Dean of Postgra duate Medical Education & Training will review the application prospectively for appropriateness of the research topic and the candidate to undertake the work. For those intending to pursue an academic path, an extended period of research may be necessary in order to explore a topic fully or to take up an opportunity of developing the basis of a future career. Such extended research may continue after the CSCST is gained. The earlier years of training will usually be directed towards acquiring a broad gene ral experience of Pharmaceutical Medicine under appropriate supervision. An increase in the content of hands -on experience follows naturally, and, as confidence is gained and abilities are acquired, the trainee will be encouraged to assume a greater degre e of responsibility and independence. \"Generic\" knowledge, skills and attitudes support competencies which are common to good medical practice in all the Medical and related specialties. It is intended that all Specialist Registrars should reaffirm releva nt competencies during Higher Specialist Training. No time -scale of acquisition is offered, but failure to make progress towards meeting these important objectives at an early stage would cause concern about a Trainee's suitability and ability to become independently capable as a specialist.

Ophthalmology (Irish College of Ophthalmologists) Ophthalmology Description Ophthalmology is the branch of medicine that deals with the anatomy, physiology and diseases of the eye and visual system. Ophthalmologists diagnose and treat patients to preserve and prevent sight loss in patients. Ophthalmology is also an adaptive and continuously evolving specialty. Ophthalmic practice is an innovative specialty and f requently adapts and implements new and emerging technologies such as imaging techniques, laser, the use of intraocular lenses and stents. Ophthalmologists work as part of a multi -disciplinary team. The eye is not an isolated unit and has complicated rela tionships with numerous other bodily systems and functions including that of the brain and nervous system. Ophthalmologists work in close collaboration with other specialists including diabetologists, rheumatologists, neurologists, ENT and maxillo -facial surgeons as well as paediatricians and geneticists. Other eye health professionals including ophthalmic nurses, orthoptists, optometrists and ophthalmic technicians play an important role in the care of eye patients and teamwork is essential. The Irish Co llege of Ophthalmologists (ICO) is the accredited postgraduate training body responsible for the delivery of Specialist Training in Medical and Surgical Ophthalmology in Ireland. The College delivers two training pathways, Specialist Training in Medical Op hthalmology and Specialist Training in Surgical Ophthalmology. Medical O phthalmologists have varying roles in health care in Ireland. Consultant Medical Ophthalmologists work in the acute and/or non -acute setting. Graduates of the programme are trained to deliver general ophthalmology care with subspecialty expertise in glaucoma, paediatric ophthalmology and medical retina. Graduates may opt to continue with further subspecialty Fellowship training and practice in either the public or the private sector. M any ophthalmologists combine private practice with their HSE role. The programme of specialist training in ophthalmology is designed to equip doctors to work in the hospital, community, both or in the independent sector. Surgical O phthalmology is a well -established Consultant position in the Irish health care. Graduates of the programme are trained to deliver general ophthalmology care with subspecialty expertise in a range of ophthalmic areas. Surgical ophthalmologists have a range of responsibilities and duties, which include cataract extraction, squint and glaucoma surgery, oculoplastic and nasolacrimal surgery. Many surgical ophthalmologists choose to sub -specialise in a particular area although most will also continue to perform cataract surgery. The m ajority of graduates will go on an overseas subspecialty fellowship and practice in either the public or the private sector. Many ophthalmologists combine private practice with their HSE role. The programme of specialist training in ophthalmology is design ed to equip Doctors to work in the public or in the independent sector. Medical Disciplines , Specialties and Training Pathways |2021 57 Created by the office of the DMHG NDTP Training Leads Ophthalmology is a continuously developing specialty. Patient needs have expanded and developed in line with treatment advances. The HSE/ICO Model of Care for Ophthalmology, describes a service model that reconfigures care away from the acute setting and into the non -acute setting. This involves the transfer of specialist services into new locations. This Model of Care, which aligns with the SlainteCare objectives, is purposefully patient centric and a very positive realignment with eye care demand in Ireland. Significant public investment in the development of ophthalmology services including the recruitment of Consultant Medical Ophthalmologists for the Integrated Eye Care Team (IEC T) model, is currently underway nationally to deliver increased specialist eye care services across the community and hospital setting. This is in line with the approved Model of Eye Care recommendations and the Government Sl\u00e1intecare policy. Priorities fo r the IECT include the management of children referred from the screening programme, collaborating with screeners to improve the accuracy of the referrals and managing adult patients with a focus on medical retina, glaucoma and the delivery of pre & post op cataract care. The teams will provide ongoing care for patients diagnosed in the community or ongoing care for patients transferred from the acute hospital. With respect to the new Consultant Medical Ophthalmologist posts, this role is designed to delive r specialist care in both the traditional acute setting and the developing non -acute setting. The design of the new appointments is deliberately co -located. The incumbents work in both settings, to ensure access to acute inpatient services if required, sub specialty resources for more complex cases, cross specialty multidisciplinary care and participation in the delivery of on -call services. Patients will be provided with specialist care irrespective of whether it is delivered within the traditional acute h ospital building or in newly developed and equipped primary care centres. Pathway Basic Training in Medical Ophthalmology The purpose of the foundation years is to provide a broad based initial training in ophthalmology with attainment of knowledge, skills and professional behaviours relevant to the practice of ophthalmology in any specialist discipline. Following successful completion of BMT1 -BMT3, Training requires passing the MRCSI Ophth examination; candidates can compete to enter Higher Speciali st Training in Medical Ophthalmology, HMT4 - HMT5. Information on Basic Training application and entry process is available on the ICO website here. Higher Specialist Training in Medical Ophthalmology The purpose of the Higher Specialist Training in Ophtha lmology programme is to provide in -depth training to equip doctors with skills they require to independently practice as specialist Medical Ophthalmologists. The programme has a modular approach and is framed around the three subspecialties located at the core of future independent practice - Medical Retina, Glaucoma and Paediatric ophthalmology. Medical Disciplines , Specialties and Training Pathways |2021 58 Created by the office of the DMHG NDTP Training Leads In medical retina, new advances in intraocular injections and laser have revolutionised the treatment of two common sight -threatening conditions, namely age -relat ed macular degeneration and diabetic maculopathy. As these conditions are very responsive to the new therapies, the work is very rewarding. Over the next 20 years, Ireland will see a significant increase in both older patients and diabetics and therefore, the number of medical ophthalmologists required to treat these patients is also expected to increase. Trainees, irrespective of preference and future career choice, need to complete all three modules to successfully complete their training .

Those trainees on Core trainin g will compete to progress to ST3 in their selected specialty towards the end of ST2. ST3 is entry level into Specialty Training in Cardiothoracic Surgery which completes at ST8 . This based on continuous assessment during ST1 & ST2 through the CAPA (Compe tency Assessment Performance Appraisal) process, successful completion of the MRCS exam and Specialty interview. ST3 entry via ESR is subject to assessment, shortlisting and interview based on application to specialty training as per the application guidel ines and specialty requirements. Duration & Organisation of Training Cardiothoracic training is undertaken in a 6 year Specialty Training Programme (ST3 - ST8). During the 6 years of training an appointed trainee will be expected to spend some time in each of the approved public cardiothoracic surgical units to acquire a rounded knowledge of the specialty. At a minimum Specialist trainee's will spend three years doing adult cardiac surgery, six months doing thoracic surgery and six months in Paediatric card iothoracic surgery. The cardiothoracic training programme has a defined curriculum that trainees need to complete. Biannual assessments, training courses, wet labs and modalities such as the Intercollegiate Surgical Curriculum (www.iscp.ac.uk ) are used to track progression throughout ST3 - ST8. Specialty trainees then have the option of focusing their training on a sub -specialty in cardiothoracic surgery i.e. adult cardiac, adult thoracic, transplantation or congenital cardiothoracic surgery. At the current time there are no sub -specialty divisions on the Irish Medical Council cardiothoracic register, however in other jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom trainees can train tow ards sub -specialist recognition i.e. congenital or thoracic. In Ireland at present most consultant cardiothoracic surgeons have a specialist interest (adult cardiac, adult thoracic, congenital or transplantation) and they may practice across the sub -specia lties. However in recent years some consultants have been appointed into single sub -specialty clinical practice i.e. thoracic surgery. Cardiothoracic sub -specialty training: - Adult cardiac specialist are expected to do a minimum of 4 years of adult cardia c surgery training and will frequently undertake specialist training in areas such as mitral repair, aortic root surgery, minimal invasive surgery or hybrid procedures (TAVI, TEVR). Medical Disciplines , Specialties and Training Pathways |2021 77 Created by the office of the DMHG NDTP Training Leads Thoracic specialist is expected to do a minimum of 2 years of adult thorac ic training, which may include oesophageal surgery. They will frequently do specialist training in thoracic oncology, VATS surgery or robotics. Transplantation specialist is expected to do a minimum of one year in thoracic organ transplantation and they ma y focus on heart or lung transplantation depending on their other area of interest (thoracic or cardiac surgery). Congenital cardiothoracic trainees are expected to spend a minimum of three years doing congenital cardiothoracic training. Often 1 -2 of these years is done post Higher Surgical Training as a fellow. Adult cardiothoracic surgery is performed at the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, St James's Hospital, St Vincent's Hospital (Thoracic), Cork University Hospital and Galway University Hospit al. The Heart and Lung transplantation Program and the ventricular assist program are delivered in the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital. All Paediatric cardiothoracic surgery is performed in Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin. The various progr ammes report their results to the society of cardiothoracic surgery of Great Britain and Ireland and NICOR, which allows the results to be compared with international units. The results are published annually and online. Biannual assessments, training courses, wet labs and modalities such as the Intercollegiate Surgical Training Programme ( www.iscp.ac.uk ) are used to track progression throughout ST3 - ST8. Trainees need to complete the curriculum and the FRCS C -Th examination in order to achieve a Certificate of Completion of Surgica l Training (CCST). Awarding of CCST deems eligibility for registration with Irish Medical Council. Intensive Care Medicine Description Intensive care medicine (ICM) is a new specialty arising from developments in medical treatment and technology aimed at treating acute organ failure. ICM involves prompt and careful patient assessment, resuscitation and on -going treatment, and close integration with many other specialties. The Intensive Care doctor's job entails the ongoing management of organ support, the interpretation of the patient's response to treatments and communicati on - mainly with the relatives of the critically ill patient. Most specialists in ICM (called intensivists) train first in another specialty and then attain higher specialist training in ICM before appointment to a Critical Care hospital team. Pathway Entr y Requirements As per the introduction, specialty training in intensive care medicine comprises base specialties (Anaesthesia, Internal and Emergency Medicine and Surgery) and 2 years supra -specialty intensive care training. Base specialty training is co mmonly 6 years. One year of intensive care training is allowed within the base specialty programme, either as a year out -of-programme or a special interest year. A second year is undertaken post base specialty CSCST. Hence the total duration of training is between 6 and 7 Medical Disciplines , Specialties and Training Pathways |2021 78 Created by the office of the DMHG NDTP Training Leads years for many trainees. The corresponding pathways to ICM training are outlined below in accordance with the particular specialty background of the prospective Intensive Care Medicine postgraduate trainee doctor. Application Process Trainees are appointed to supervised training posts through a central applications process under the auspices of the JFICMI. Currently there is an annual intake of trainees, with variable training numbers contingent on the numbers of applicants for special in terest year posts and those eligible for post -CST appointment. The numbers of each is approximately 8 at special interest year and 4 at post CSCST year in 2017. Application process is advertised in October, interviews in November / December, and appointme nts generally commence in July of the following year. All training posts are in intensive care units accredited via the JFICMI visitation process (see website for accredited hospital list, www.jficmi.ie ) Training Pathw ays a) Current Training pathways and regulations Year 1 of specialty ICM training is characterised by the acquisition of the competencies specified within the curriculum, technical and procedural expertise (see Logbook / Procedures) and success at a summati ve Fellowship exam (Written, Clinical plus Viva) which is undertaken (FJFICMI) at the end of year 1. Intensive Care training at Year 1 may be achieved as a special interest year (SIY) in ICM, as per the established CAI training programme. Completion of Yea r 1 shall be in the senior years of advanced training for all base specialties (ie. SAT 5/6 for anaesthesia trainees and equivalent for other base specialties). Where this year of intensive care training is not completed within the anaesthesia or other tra ining programme, the trainee will need to complete 2 years of ICM training post base specialty CSCST. During year 2 of specialty training, there is no further exam in ICM but publications / project or other accreditation (for example in critical care echo cardiography) is required - as is suitable to a pre - consultant year of training. Competencies to be attained are as outlined in the JFICMI Curriculum document, with a particular focus on professionalism, and clinical leadership. By the end of training, ye ar 2 trainees will have completed 24 months of dedicated ICM training to include: - Completion of all the 12 domains of ICM competency - Basic Critical Care echocardiography competence -Attendance at a BASIC course - Attendance at an IDAP (Donor Awaren ess Programme) course - Completion of a prospectively approved audit or research project with associated presentations and publication(s) Medical Disciplines , Specialties and Training Pathways |2021 79 Created by the office of the DMHG NDTP Training Leads - Specific advanced training in critical care echocardiography or extra -corporeal life support (ECLS) training and a ccreditation or an alternative pathway to research (duration of training would preclude satisfactory completion of both research and specific advanced training modules). Current Training Outcomes and Career Structure: The successful completion of one year of ICM training (as above), which includes success at the FJFICMI exam, allows eligibility (in Ireland) for a 'consultant with a special interest in ICM' position provided also that CSCST in base specialty is achieved. This career option is only utili sed / available in Anaesthesia at present. 6 The successful completion of a pre -approved second 'supra -specialist' year of ICM training (see guidance above) will allow accreditation as a completed trainee in ICM. Such status will allow eligibility for spec ialist registration in ICM with the Medical Council of Ireland and eligibility to apply for a Consultant in Intensive Care Medicine position Neurosurgery Description Neurosurgery (or neurological surgery) is the medical specialty concerned with the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation of disorders which affect any portion of the nervous system including the brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerves, and extra -cranial c erebrovascular system.
