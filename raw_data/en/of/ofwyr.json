One of those scientific protocols is to not use pregnant women as test subjects in any scientific or medical study. This is for the obvious potential risk to the unborn baby as well as to the mother. This condition of research came about after World War II as a result of the investigation into the Nazi war crimes and performing dangerous and unethical experiments on people at the time. The resulting Nuremberg Code, of ethical research conditions, included the research subject must be given full informed consent of the experiment, of their willingness to be given voluntarily, all physical and mental suffering should be avoided, the risks should not exceed the importance of the problem being investigated, and other conditions (Lupton & Williams, 2004). The more recent Helsinki Code updates the requirements. The Nuremberg Code included pregnant women as being protected, or prevented from being used in medical research. Hence there is NO evidence for safety or efficacy of any medications, treatments or vaccines from the manufacturers in pregnant women. Medications and vaccines are approved for public distribution and use without any evidence on pregnant women. This is why when any GP, doctor, public health officer, or politician who says that, for example, flu vaccines or COVID-19 vaccines are safe or effective in pregnant women, they are LYING to you. Despite this scientific protocol, many studies looking at medications for COVID are actually including pregnant women in about 23-25% of medical trials (Taylor et al., 2020). The authors of this published article are actually recommending, despite decades of scientific protocols, to include pregnant women in more clinical trials. This is a disgrace. And with vaccine manufacturers being protected by many world governments from any legal liability from lawsuits for any damage or health issues or deaths they cause, the risks of a (very poorly tested) COVID vaccine is far too great a risk for a pregnant woman, or anyone really for that matter. Currently, the World Health Organisation (WHO) are recommending that, based on a lack of evidence for the above reasons, pregnant women should NOT get one of the COVID-19 vaccines (Sydney Morning Herald, 2021a). But sadly, individual countries are not heeding this advice. So why do the Centres for Disease Control (CDC) in the US say \"getting vaccinated is a personal choice for people who are pregnant\"?! (CDC, 2021). When they really should be saying \"due to a lack of evidence of safety and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines in pregnant women, we recommend that women who think they may be pregnant or who are pregnant should not receive this vaccine\". Why are the CDC not informing the population of the risks (ie, NO informed consent), and working for the people, to reduce risks of vaccine damage in pregnant women and their babies? The CDC is also recommending that women who are trying to get pregnant or who may be pregnant, to NOT test for pregnancy before getting the COVID-19 vaccine! In the UK, they are being a little more open and saying that the COVID vaccines have not yet been tested in pregnancy, and those who are pregnant should not have this vaccine (Public Health England, 2021). They also say if you get pregnant after the first vaccine, to delay the second vaccine until after the pregnancy. Similar with breastfeeding, as there is again no evidence, they recommend to delay the vaccine until after breastfeeding. In the European Union, there is less advice than from the above other countries. They simply say that animal studies show no effects in pregnancy. But that doesn't mean anything unless you are a mouse, rat or hamster. They say that the decision to get the COVID vaccine should be a personal one made in conjunction with a healthcare professional. No details of risks or the lack of any studies in pregnancy, or informed consent. In Australia, the situation is quite dire. The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists is calling for pregnant and breastfeeding women to be included in clinical trials, with a view to making the vaccine available to them (Sydney Morning Herald, 2021a)! The Australian government are also planning to spend $24 million of taxpayer money on a marketing campaign, targeting women in their 30s, as well as migrants and indigenous people, and pregnant women too, to get the COVID vaccine (Sydney Morning Herald, 2021b). There have already been some reports of spontaneous premature birth immediately after a COVID vaccine, spontaneous miscarriages, and foetal deaths recorded in the US database of vaccine adverse events. This is why pregnant women are not supposed to be tested in clinical trials, and why they should NOT be given these new vaccines. These \"health\" organisations and government health departments who are not giving you full informed consent of the risks of the COVID vaccines, or are recommending these vaccines to pregnant women are giving dangerous advice which is unscientific, immoral, unconscionable, and illegal. The individuals and organisations giving this advice will be held accountable in time. Pregnant women are vulnerable physically, mentally and emotionally, and obviously want the best for their health and their baby. They MUST be given the correct advice from authorities who are supposed to protect them, but sadly we cannot trust these authorities anymore, and they must seek expert advice from elsewhere instead. Pregnant women must NOT be used as guinea pigs in a worldwide Nazi-like medical experiment that we are currently experiencing. Stay healthy! References: Centres for Disease Control (CDC). (2021).
