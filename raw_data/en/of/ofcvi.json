Program Description and Relationship to System -Level Goals A. Briefly describe within a few paragraphs the degree program under consideration, including (a) level; (b) em phases, including concentrations, tracks, or specializations; (c) total number of credit hours; and (d) overall purpose, including examples of employment or education opportunities that may be available to program graduates. USF College of Pharmacy's (COP ) Mission is to revolutionize health by innovation of patient centered healthcare through education, research, and service in addition to empowerment of students, professionals, and patients as catalysts for change at all levels of health. Consistent with this mission, to advance the research mission, COP established the Office of Graduate Programs (OGP) in 2013. The strategic goals of OGP include: i) to increase quality of both graduate and professional programs at COP by establish ing graduate certifica tes, graduate degree programs both at the Master's and Doctoral level, ii) to enhance domestic and international recruitment, enrollment, and retention of graduate students that reflects diversity, iii) to strive to enhance the academic experience of and the quality of life for graduate students, iv) to pursue for research funding and conduct and publish research that leads to opportunities for graduate student success, v) to partner with the other USF Colleges and SUS institutions to develop creative init iatives that promote graduate student research, and vi) to serve as a leader in promoting interdisciplinary graduate programs.\" (Our website - http://health.usf.edu/pharmacy/graduate -programs.htm) The Doctor of Philosophy in Pharmacy with emphasis in Tran slational Nanomedicine and Industrial Pharmacy is a field of study that seeks to understand the relationships among pharmaceutics through physiological causes, course and consequences of pharmaceuticals , improve ment of health -related quality of life by dru g delivery and the manufacture of pharmaceutics and devices . This field draws its body of knowledge from multiple disciplines spanning the physiological, pharmacological and health, social and engineering sciences and uses nano -bio and cellular - technologi es in order to approach the individual patient , who lives with or is at risk of morbidity or mortality. The COP at t he University of South Florida is uniquely qualified to offer a PhD in Pharmacy based on the interdisciplinary composition and extensive i nter-professional experience of its faculty, curriculum, and research portfolio. The multiple -faceted emphasis and concentrations of the proposed program in Pharmacy will distinguish the program from more traditional PhD programs within the state and natio n. (a) Level: Doctorate Degree (PhD) (b) Emphases, including concentrations, tracks or specializations: The PhD program at the COP aims to educate the new generation of PhDs in fundamental aspects of pharmacy through didactic online/in -class courses and directed cutting - edge research in two track areas. The two concentrations proposed are: i) Translational Nanomedicine, and ii) Industrial Pharmacy. The rationale for a PhD program in Pharmacy with emphasis in Translational Nanomedicine and Industrial Pharmacy is to keep with recent advances in the cell -, genomic -, nanobio -, and manufacturing technologies, which are expected to revolutionize the production of pharmaceutics and devices for health care in the 21st century - enabling us to gain new insights in diagnos tics, prognostics and therapy, and contributing to the development of new generations of pharmaceutical products and services. (c) Total Credit Hours (all concentrations ): 72 credit hours (d) Overall Purpose: The COP PhD program is designed to educate and train scientists to use their knowledge, problem solving and critical thinking skills to determine the best solutions to the health -care problems of today and the future. The dynamic changes that are occurring 3 in the health systems of America will continue to d emand research pharmacy PhDs trained in cutting -edge technologies. The overall purpose of the proposed program is two -fold: i) to prepar e students for a career as faculty researchers who will contribute to the development of pharmacy practice, research an d education in an emerging twenty -first century health care environment ; and ii) to prepar e students in nano -sciences and health f ield for employment in the biop harmaceutical industries or government research and regulatory sectors . Graduates of the propos ed PhD program in Pharmacy are expected to demonstrate advanced knowledge and productivity related to research, education, and service through inter - professional collaborations designed to generate and extend knowledge that is focused and evidence -based. Examples of employment opportunities available to program graduates: The graduates may enter academia and serve as a faculty. The national demand for Pharmacy PhD programs arises from estimated need for ~1,200 new faculty members during the next decade (AA CP). One of this program's goal will be to create a new generation of faculty, with a broad perspective of enablement that can be linked to the economic development and betterment of the health and welfare of the citizens of our state and society. Addition ally, well trained new faculty will enhance research funding to the USF and State from Federal sources such as NIH and NSF, while significantly improving the quality of overall Pharmacy education. Further, the creati on of the translational research doctora te program will increase the credentialing of the PhD in Pharmacy graduates and their contribution to ph armaceutical industries including pharmaceutical device companies in the s tate. Other employment opportunities for COP PhD in Pharmacy graduates would b e with world -renowned industries, companies and governments. Another goal of this program is to generate additional employment in the nanotechnology industries . The employment of PhD pharmacists with nanomedicine -related skills is projected to grow by 41,4 00 (an increase of 14%) during 2012 -2022 according to data supplied by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. The new concentrations contained within this proposed PhD program will address the needs and future health care demands of Florida. This program align s with our USF System and Tampa campus strategic plans to achieve AAU status. The Pharmacy PhD program would align USF with other AA U institutions that have existing or recently established PhD programs in Pharmacy, including both USF institutional and asp irational peers. B. Please provide the date when the pre -proposal was presented to CAVP (Council of Academic Vice Presidents) Academic Program Coordination review group. Identify any concerns that the CAVP review group raised with the pre -proposed program a nd provide a brief narrative explaining how each of these concerns has been or is being addressed. The pre -proposal was presented to CAVP and APC review group on November 17, 2014 . CAVP group raised two concerns: i) an OCR (Office of Civil Rights) concer n. It is imperative that the appropriate letter from FAMU be procured as part of the full proposal , ii) Differentiating the program from those at other SUS Institution s. For example, one institutional representative mentioned that the emphasis on pharmaco genomics is not new - UF has some renowned faculty in the area. As a result, it was also suggested that the case for non -duplication be made stronger in the full proposal. No specific concurrence was raised except that a concurrence from Florida A & M University was needed. To address the CAVP concerns , the proposed program is designed such that it has very little overlap with the program offered by University of Florida and Florida Agriculture and Mechanical University (FAMU ). The proposed program has its emphasis on Translational Nanomedicine and Industrial Pharmacy. Previously proposed Basic and clinical pharmacogenomics was completely removed from emphasis, alleviating the UF concern. We also compared this new program with FAMU 's PhD program in Pha rmaceutical Sciences , which offers concentrations in pharmacology/toxicology, medicinal chemistry, pharmaceutics and environmental toxicology. Based on a review of the FAMU catalog and PhD curriculum (courses) posted 4 in its website, we believe that the pro posed program at USF is su bstantially different from the FAMU's PhD in Pharmaceutical Sciences degree Further, at the time of Master of Science in Pharmaceutical Nanotechnology, it was discussed that USF will collaborate with FAMU in research education tra ining. To this end, both Dr. Mohapatra and Dr. Sneed have reached out to FAMU CREATE (Center for Research and Education Training) program directed by Dr. Shawn Spencer for collaboration, which is currently taking shape. Dean Sneed has also discussed with F AMU Dean regarding the area of specialization of our PhD proposal that focuses on Translational Nanomedicine and Industrial Pharmacy and is substantially different from that FAMU's PhD Program . A letter of concurrence from the current FAMU provost Rodner W right will be requested by the Provost Wilcox after he has considered the full proposal tentatively approved by the Graduate Council C. If this is a doctoral level program , please include the external consultant's report at the end of the proposal as Appendi x D. Please provide a few highlights from the report and describe ways in which the report affected the approval process at the university. The full proposal for a PhD In Pharmacy with emphasis on Transl ational Nanomedicine and Industrial Pharmacy was s ubmitted to examined by an Independent consultant, who was asked to comment on the followings: 1) need and demand for the program including the need for USF to have the program, community/societal need, need for the program within the academic discipline and workforce demand for the program; 2) quality of the program including its structure, curriculum, anticipated changes in the discipline; and 3) qualifications of faculty including existing faculty expertise, additional faculty expertise needed and a nticipated needs for future development. Please see Appendix D for Consultant's Report. D. Describe how the proposed program is consistent with the current State University System (SUS) Strategic Planning Goals. Identify which specific goals the program wi ll directly support and which goals the program will indirectly support (see link to the SUS Strategic Plan on the resource page for new program proposal ). The PhD degree program in Pharmacy strongly aligns with the FL BOG Strategic Priorities and Goals for 2012 -2025; which emphasizes the followings: 1 Teaching & Learning - Educating the next generation of faculty scholars and researchers to populate the graduate and professional educ ational programs which train the future health care workforce, increasing the number of degrees awarded in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM ) area of strategic emphasis ; 2 Scholarship, Research & Innovation - Converting university research in pharmacy into the commercialization or improvement of products, such as new drugs , drug -delivery devices and systems, drug delivery methods, and new ways of manufacturing drugs while strengthening the University's reputation for the quality of scholarship, research and innovation; 3 Community & Business Engagement - Increasing faculty capacity to support a vibrant healthcare workforce. Our PhD program is an integral component of our USF -Tampa vision to increase community outreach and business engagement. COP PhD in Pharmacy in Industrial Pharmacy track aims to train students by establishing a public private consortium agreement with specific pharmaceutical or device companies in the State of Florida. To this end, an Industry Advisory Board is being put togethe r in addition to existing COP advisory Board. The participating industry will have their scientists appointed as adjunct faculty , and students will be trained and conduct research at the COP Labs and also in the premise of a participating industry. 5 The P hD program will become the hub through existing USF Health and Tampa campus academic assets and can leverage the full capability of USF within the SUS in addressing the needs of Florida's population thus enhancing our engagement with communities and busine ss entities. The PhD degree program in Pharmacy is also strongly aligned with the USF System Strategic Plan Goals to: (1) create well -educated and highly skilled global citizens through our continuing commitment to student success; (2) develop high -impact research and innovation to change lives, improve health, and foster sustainable development and positive society change; (3) build a highly effective, major economic engine, creating new partnerships to build a strong and sustainable future for Florida in the global economy ; and (4) provide sound financial management to establish a strong and sustainable economic base in support of USF's continued academic advancement. E. If the program is to be included in a category within the Programs of Strategic Emphasi s as described in the SUS Strategic Plan, please indicate the category and the justification for inclusion. 1. The PhD degree program in Pharmacy will need to be included in the Critical Workforce - Health Care because of the following. There are a number of h ealth -related technology and data management programs that have emerged in recent years as high -demand and high - wage occupations. In addition, there is a growing consensus that Florida will need to expand its healthcare workforce in all related occupations as the provisions of the Affordable Care Act are implemented and the state experiences a demographic transition as the Baby Boom Generation retires. Special emphasis areas, such as Translational Nanomedicine and Industrial Pharmacy are among a number of health -related technology programs which have emerged in recent years and lead to employment in high -demand and high -wage positions. The SUS has highlighted the growing consensus that Florida will require to expand its healthcare workforce in all related o ccupations. This area of programmatic strategic emphasis included all health related degree programs under the 51 CIP code. We propose that the PhD in Pharmacy be categorized under CIP code 51.2099 -which includes Pharmacy, Pharmaceutical Sciences, and Ad ministration, Other. 2. Although not specifically identified as a traditional STEM program, nanotechnology is a field that integrates physics, chemistry, and biology with engineering and hence can be considered to align strategically with interdisciplinary ST EM. PhD in Pharmacy with emphasis on Translational nanomedicine and Industrial Pharmacy has an important role in pharmaceutical research and development as well as the discovery of new drugs, antibiotics, vaccines and biomedical devices to diagnose , treat or prevent a wide range of health problems. The time required to develop a new treatment from bench tests to clinical trials is extensive . Therefore , most companies have several major programs running concurrently. This is sometimes referred to as the deve lopment \"pipeline.\" Because many projects incorporate all aspects of research and development, the pharmaceutical field usually involves a broad array of basic science research in conjunction with STEM disciplines. The PhD degree program in Pharmacy will n eed to be included in the Economic Development - STEM , which aims to emphasize the importance of these programs to Florida's economy. The broad category of STEM encompasses programs associated with the six subcategories including mechanical science and manu facturing, natural science and technology, Medical science and technology and Computer science and technology. The latter holds the greatest potential for engagement and partnership with a variety of state and 6 federal governmental agencies, industries and the private business sector challenged to forecast and meet the needs of a rapidly aging population. F. Identify any established or planned educational sites at which the program is expected to be offered and indicate whether it will be offered only at sit es other than the main campus. The core coursework and several of the electives for the COP PhD program will be offered on -line, but specific elective courses, particularly those involving research or industrial training, will be taught in a traditional f ace-to-face format on the home campus or within Nano -industry working with the USF. The on-line and face -to-face courses will be delivered by USF's COP housed on the Tampa campus. Research opportunities may be supervised not only by core faculty from the C OP but also by other USF faculty members from the Morsani College of Medicine and College of Engineering, as appropriate. In addition, collaborative arrangements with FAMU, especially with their CREATE program is under discussion, though a timeline for su ch collaboration in development has not been finalized. Faculty labs at FAMU may serve as instructional sites for students in the program. Furthermore, aspects of the research didactics may be taught at USF's Center for Research and Education in Nanobioeng ineering, Morsani College of Medicine; The Nanotechnology Research and Education Center, College of Engineering; and USF's Center for Advanced Medical Learning and Simulation (CAMLS) or within an approved Nanotech Company. It is also anticipated that coll aborative agreements with several pharmaceutical and device industries in the region will allow research to be conducted partly in Industry Labs. INSTITUTIONAL AND ST ATE LEVEL ACCOUNTABI LITY II. Need and Demand A. Need: Describe national, state, and/or local data that support the need for more people to be prepared in this program at this level. Reference national, state, and/or local plans or reports that support the need for this program and requests for the proposed program which have emanated from a perc eived need by agencies or industries in your service area. Cite any specific need for research and service that the program would fulfill. Global/National: The undoubted promise of nanoscience and nanoengineering for the development of novel and highly e fficient therapeutics, i.e., drugs, is yet to materialize...a review of 10 years from now will paint a very different picture and the therapeutic use of true nanopharmaceuticals will have become common clinical practice (Weissig, V. and Guzman -Villanueva, D. (2015) International Journal of Nanomedicine, published online Feb. 11, 2015, pp. 1245 -1257). At this writing only 43 true nanopharmaceutical drugs are in clinical trials (cited above), but this is only the beginning for the explosive growth anticipated i n nanopharmacy. This inchoate field promises to overtake traditional pharmaceutical research as bench trials become clinical trials and the field of individualized medicine blossoms to its full potential. Increasing demand and awareness of applications for nanotechnology in medicine has already resulted in a new discipline - pharmaceutical nanotechnology. As nano scale science and technology, specifically biomedical nan otechnology, increases its impact on healthcare in our da ily lives, the opportun ities for careers will expanding rapidly and be manifested not only in the health sciences but also in an as yet indeterminate number of commercial endeavors. According to Careers and Recruitment's Big Opportunity's In a Small World , (2009), several new companies are recruiting individuals with strong backgrounds in physics, chemistry or medicine and who also demonstrate the ability to conduct novel, interdisciplinary nanotechnology research. As there are as yet an insufficient number of qualified candidates to fi ll these positions, students graduating from the proposed COP PhD program would be perfectly positioned to immediately enter the workforce. The lack of qualified individuals to fill positions in pharmaceutical nanotechnology is further highlighted 7 by indi viduals such as Dr. Freddy Chiang from Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, who hopes to recruit at least 20 individuals with expertise in the field over the next few years. He stated: My problem is not capacity, it is finding good people . Althou gh there are a multitude of opportunities for those trained in pharmaceutical nanotechnology, finding people with the requisite skills for this interdisciplinary field can be difficult. \" We need people who have developed an intuition about multi -scale systems \u2014 those who can think about the particle or structure that is one billionth of a meter and its potential role in a device that is a few centimeters in size ,\" says Randy Goodall, chief executive of NanoMedical Systems. Federal funding agen cies likewise are recognizing the need for nano medicine training and are focusing more and more of their dwindling budget on high-stakes nanot ech projects. For example, the 2016 Federal Budget will provide more than $1 .5 billion for the National Nanotechnology Initiativ e. This brings the federal contribution to nanoresearch to $22 billion since 2001. Of the agencies receiving funding for nanoresearch, the lion's share has gone to the National Institute of Health and the National Science Foundation, the two agencies fro m which USF draws much of its research support (Nano.gov, National Nanotechnology Initiative). A major challenge in nanotechnology research and produ ct development is the insufficiency of educated and trained employees. By virtue of this degree program, US F Pharmacy will strive to be on the cutting edge of these new research and development initiatives. Grant opportunities also provide employment opportunities as post -doctoral fellows, faculty, and laboratory staff may be funded by research grants. Accordi ng to recent estimates by the Bureau of Labor Statistics the employment of pharmaceutical scientists/pharmacists is projected to grow 14 percent from 2012 to 2022 with (41,400 new jobs and a median income of $116,670), which is at least as fast as the aver age for all occupations ( Nanotechnology Research Directions for Societal Needs in 2020 : Retrospective and Outlook , 2010) . However, biophysicists, an occupational area directly related to the needs of nanoresearch, are anticipated to grow by 19%, faster than the national average for other occupations. Even as nanoresearch grows, it is anticipated that a convergence of disciplines such as nanopharmacy, biophysics, and nanoengineering creating a synthesis of highly sought after scientists. Several factors a re likely to contribute to this growth. The pop ulation is aging (baby boomers) with higher rates of chronic diseases, requiring scientific advances leading to new drug products. An increased reliance on pharmaceuticals, greater affluence that allows for more spending on medicine \u2014along with a larger and aging population, and the need for a greater understanding of biological processes are all factors that are expected to increase demand for pharmaceutical scientists . State: A recent survey of States in US A, Florida deemed to be third largest in population, but ranked poorly in overall economic development. This was partly due to low ranks in infrastructure (rank 27), workforce (rank 14), technology and innovation (rank 17) and education (rank 26) (www. cnbc .com/americas -top-states -for-business/) . Overall, the workforce involves only low -salaried jobs. Presumably, Floridians who go outside for PhD in Pharmacy and Health Sciences , do not return back to the State. In the state of Florida, with >1000 pharmaceuti cal/ biotech/medical device industries (>200 in Tampa Bay area), a PhD program in industrial pharmacy to produce high cadre PhD pharmacists is a dire need for the State. According to the Labor Market Statistic s (LMS) between 2015 and 2023, the growth rate in jobs is estimated at 16.7% for medical scientists, 15.6% for life scientists, 15.7% for health educators and 21 % for biomedical engineers (LMS, projections2023db). The PhD program in COP will be offered in thrust areas that are based on emerging transla tional technologies, which are cutting - edge research disciplines and are not offered (e.g., translational nanomedicine, and industrial pharmacy). These programs are not offered in the two other public universities in the State of Florida, UF and FAMU. Thus , the proposed program meets workforce and economic development needs of the State of Florida USF : The proposed PhD in Pharmacy program in COP, USF will provide advanced professional training in at least two different areas beyond the master degree : Trans lational Nanotechnology and Industrial Pharmacy . USF designs its graduate programs to specifically address critical needs of the State, boost economic development while developing cutting edge technologies to meet the highest national and international sta ndards. USF graduate degrees are highly recognized and graduates generally find satisfactory employment, whether in higher education, private business, industry, government and other areas. Graduate students and faculty partners develop new technologies an d compete for over $4 50 8 million annually in external grants and contracts. Graduate student participation is not only limited to their research efforts but also their active participation in technology transfer, licensing and business startups all of which are critical for Florida economic development and growth. Overall, the proposed PhD in Pharmacy program will ma ke high impact at local, state, national and international levels by tangible return on investment in economic front and will promote better r esearch funding to the USF and State from Federal sources and will significantly improve the quality of Pharmacy education. B. Demand: Describe data that support the assumption that students will enroll in the proposed program. Include descriptions of surv eys or other communications with prospective students. 1. Increased interest of PharmD students to diversify and improve their professional training. In about 60 % of the students admit ted to this professional program with either a BS or MS degree. With resp ect to research and service needs, all pharmacy - based and related educational programs' faculty are being held to enhanced expectations for scholarship and research activity, especially in the area of evidence -based practice. Thus , students need for more extensive education in research methodology and statistics in order to conduct cli nical studies, pursue evidence -based practice and recognize that an academic doctoral degree is necessary to secure and advance in a faculty career. The fact that a majority (90%)of the didactic courses offered to PhD students will be on -line, will make it easier for other students in the College of Pharmacy to take the courses that may be deemed beneficial to individual students. The American Association of Colleges of Pha rmacy ( AACP ) now requires evaluative criteria for Pharmacy Programs. The Commission on Accreditation in Pharmacy Education requires evidence that at least 50% of the core faculty have an advanced doctoral degrees. A PhD degree program in Pharmacy would be most appealing for these faculty and other health/pharmacy - related disciplines due to its inter -professional nature. The lack of academically qualified faculty is the rate limiting step for initial program establishment or existing health professions progr ams' expansion. To determine interest in the proposed graduate program, the USF College of Pharmacy's Office of Graduate Programs (OGP) included survey items to measure interest in the program. The survey was sent to current students in the Doctor of Ph armacy program. The survey expla ined the needs and goals for graduate programs including a master's degree and a PhD degree. Of 71 respondents, 90% had read or heard about the program. Overall, 95% of these respondents found a need for additional graduate programs in College of Pharmacy and 36% showed an interest in a specialization in nanopharmacy and nanomedicine. Approximately 68% of the respondents would recommend a nanopharmacy program to others. 2. External technological developments will force Phar mD students to pursue PhD. Smart RX Systems, an automated medication dispensing platform using the Smart PharmAssist Kiosk doesn't replace pharmacists, but allows them more time to council patients while the automated retail Kiosk fills prescriptions in less than two minutes! The available technology includes best -in-class software, real -time connectivity, detailed reporting, and medication dispense at the point of care. Key services include: d ispensing at the point of care, live pharmacist via video conf erencing technology, managing product distribution, and stocking the Smart Rx Systems Kiosks. Such developments in pharmacy care is expected to force Pharm D students to enhance their pharmacy education by enrolling in dual degree programs including PhD programs, which is expected to enhance their securing jobs in Pharmaceutical and device industries, and in government sectors. 3. High Demand for Professional Master's Program at the College of Medicine. A further indication of student interest in the program stems from the increasing demand for 9 graduate education in medical sciences. The current Master of Medical Science in the Morsani College of Medicine at the University of South Florida, admits ~3 00 applica nts each year. While some of the graduates get to professional doctoral programs, others about a quarter of the graduates seek to admit to a PhD program . The Biomedical PhD program at the College of Medicine only accepts ~15 -20 PhD students per year. Given the unique specialization our PhD program will p rovide and its linkage with industry, our program may be attractive to some of these graduates. This program is the first of its kind in Florida and aims to bridge the gap between nanotechnology and medicine, providing students with advanced knowledge, skills and practical experience of the principles, technology and applications within this exciting area. C. If substantially similar programs (generally at the four -digit CIP Code or 60 percent similar in core courses), either private or public exist in the state, identify the institution(s) and geographic location(s). Summarize the outcome(s) of communication with such programs with regard to the potential impact on their enrollment and opportunities for possible collaboration (instruction and research). In Appendix C, provide data that support the need for an additional program. Currently there are two public Universities and one private Universities that offer PhD programs in pharmacy and pharmaceutical sciences. The programs in these Universities are described below. The University of Florida (UF) is located in the central region of the State. UF offers PhD program in five concentrations: Medicinal Chemistry, Pharmaceutics, Pharmacodynamics, Pharmaceutical Outcomes and Policy, and Clinical Pharmaceut ical Sciences. UF takes a total of about 15 students per year in its different concentrations. Florida Agriculture and Mechanical University (FAMU ) is located in the northern part of the State and is a minority dominant University. FAMU's PhD program in Pharmaceutical Sciences with concentrations in pharmacology/toxicology, medicinal chemistry, pharmaceutics and environmental toxicology. FAMU have increased their PhD student enrollment since being established. Total research doctorates awarded by FAMU has doubled from 11 in 2007 -08 to 23 in 2011 -12. Nova South Eastern University (NSU) is located in the eastern part of the State. In addition to the two public universities, a private university Nova South Eastern University located in Fort Lauderdale also offers in its College of Pharmacy a PhD program in three different concentrations including Molecular Medicine & Pharmacogenomics , Drug Development (Pharmaceutics) and Social & Administrative Pharmacy . Distinctness of the proposed program . The proposed PhD program at the COP aims to educate the new generatio n of PhDs in fundamental aspects in two different thrust areas: Translational Nanomedicine, and Industrial Pharmacy. The authors are unaware of a program within the SUS that focuses exclusively on the theory and application of Translational Nanotechnology and Industrial Pharmacy . Having compared the concentrations and the courses taught, we do not believe that the proposed PhD curriculum is substantially divergent from the existing programs. Impact . It is expected that the proposed PhD program will have little impact on other existing pro grams because of the followings: 1) The existing programs are located different geographical regions ( Northern , Central and Eastern regions of FL). There is no such program in Southern FL. 2) The program emphasis of the exis ting programs are substantially different such that the students targeted for admission are not same., so it will not impact any enrollment in the existing programs. 10 3) It is anticipated that the that the student demand for proposed Pharmacy program will be great, since no program of this kind exists within t he southern region of the state 4) USF has established its reputation as a global research university and the number of research doctoral applications in medical sciences at the USF/USF Health is increas ing with a rejection rate of ~ 80% in 2014, suggesting demand for the proposed program. 5) USF biomedical , chemical engineering and biomedical engineering Master's programs graduate ~500 students each year and a significant proportion of th ese wish to pursue studies involving research that leads to PhD degrees. D. Use Table 1 in Appendix A (1 -A for undergraduate and 1 -B for graduate ) to categorize projected student headcount (HC) and Full Time Equivalents (FTE) according to primary sources. Generally unde rgraduate FTE will be calculated as 40 credit hours per year and graduate FTE will be calculated as 32 credit hours per year. Describe the rationale underlying enrollment projections. If students within the institution are expected to change majors to en roll in the proposed program at its inception, describe the shifts from disciplines that will likely occur. We anticipate an initial enrollment of 5 students the first year (with their expected completion in 4 years) , and enrollment of 5 students each sub sequent year increasing to a maximal of about 2 0 students by year five. Enrollment will not be limited to the Tampa metropolitan area but will encompass the entire State of Florida. The fact that this program will be uniquely geared towards applying nanote chnology to the extremely important areas of pharmaceutical sciences and drug delivery , should ensure extensive interest among Florida students in the biomedical sciences. Our internal surveys revealed a strong level of interest within USF Health. The COP will monitor admission application demographics and work with USF's Office of Graduate studies to ensure only students in states for which we have state authorization are admitted to the program. We will also admit foreign students with F1 Visa to the pro gram. Furthermore, the COP will engage in appropriate market research to measure the level of interest nationally and internationally. All students admitted to this PhD program will be new students. W e do not anticipate that the PhD program will result in any shifts in FTE in other programs. We anticipate little impact on other academic areas. E. Indicate what steps will be taken to achieve a diverse student body in this program. If the proposed program substantially duplicates a program at FAMU or FIU, p rovide, (in consultation with the affected university), an analysis of how the program might have an impact upon that university's ability to attract students of races different from that which is predominant on their campus in the subject program. The un iversity's Equal Opportunity Officer shall review this section of the proposal and then sign and date Appendix B to indicate that the analysis required by this subsection has been completed . The COP and USF Health attracts a diverse student body to its e ntry-level Doctor of Pharmacy degree program from qualified resident and non -resident domestic students. The COP and USF Health fully supports the University of South Florida's mission, goals, values and vision as they relate to diversity. Student policies , practices, recruitment and retention reflect the School and College's mutual goal of cultural competence, diversit y and inclusion. In 2015 of the students in professional Doctor of Pharmacy degree program, 7.9% of students were African -American and 5% As ian American (http://www.aacp.org/resources/research/institutionalresearch/ Documents/Introduction.pdf). We anticipate our diversity will only continue to increase with the initi ation of this PhD program and with the ability to enroll international students. We intend to broadly market this new degree program throughout Florida and the United States in publications that focus on student diversity and academic programs. We will ut ilize USF Health, COP and Graduate Programs' existing marketing and recruitment strategies through our professional associations and conferences to promote the program. Through consultation with USF World, we will reach out to USF's partnering institutions in China, UK, India and Panama about the establishment of the program. 11 To the best of our knowledge, the proposed program in Translational Nanomedicine and Industrial Pharmacy (CIP 51.2099 -other) does not substantially duplicate any program at FAMU. H owever, we plan to collaborate with FAMU through their CREATE program that is currently being created at the FAMU and will assist in their training by allowing didactic on -line PhD Courses. III. Budget A. Use Table 2 in Appendix A to display projected costs and associated funding sources for Year 1 and Year 5 of program operation. Use Table 3 in Appendix A to show how existing Education & General funds will be shifted to support the new program in Year 1. In narrative form, summarize the contents of both table s, identifying the source of both current and new resources to be devoted to the proposed program. (Data for Year 1 and Year 5 reflect snapshots in time rather than cumulative costs.) The College of Pharmacy has the resources necessary to offer the pro posed PhD in Pharmacy ( see Table 2 in Appendix A). The program will be initiated and supported through reallocation of existing COP faculty effort, planned new faculty hires and the inclusion of graduate assistantship positions in future faculty grants and contracts by Year 5. Please note that the E&G Cost per FTE appears higher due to COP faculty being on 12 month contracts. The program is expected to admit about 5 for each year combining registrations for fall or spring semester. The chart below shows the comparison of detailed costs for years one and five. It is expected that the new student admissions will rise to about 20 students by year five. As shown in Appendix A - Table 2: Projected costs and funding sources indicates that the COP has allocated $ 550,000 in funding for year one. This breaks down as follows: total for Faculty Salaries (1.85 FTE in cluding regular faculty and new part -time faculty hire) for year one is $350,000; A & P salary of $90,000; USPS salary of $58,000; other personnel adjuncts and graduate assistants $156,403; other miscellaneous expenses of $38,000; library cost of $5,000; and a capital outlay of $10,000. Note that all expenditures are tailored by the program administrators to achieve a robust initiation of the program. Tuitio n waivers & Graduate Assistantships (GA)/Teaching Assistants (TA) assistantships) by the college for the first 10 students admitted to the program within the first two years. Year three -five, the college will cover tuition waivers but salaries for GA's as sistantships will be covered by the major faculty's grants. The axillary fund ($126,403) is the money received from OGP Master's revenue which is used for the first year PhD student stipend and tuition waiver. As shown in Table 2, by the end of year five, the OGP faculty effort will increase with efforts from three additional full -time faculty being added to COP totaling 4.12 FTE. A&P faculty will increase from one to two in year one through five and USPS will increase to two by year five. The axillary fun d ($156,403) is the money received from OGP Master's revenue which is used for the first year PhD student stipend and tuition waiver. By the end of year five the college will have developed MOU's with the Pharmaceutical Industry to work with our students w hile providing funding to support the GA assistantship partially and in some cases fully. Table 3 shows the anticipated reallocation of Education & General Funds indicate $5,398,250 base before reallocation in the amount of $550,000 with an estimated base rate of $4,848,250 in the COP's program and/or E&G account scheduled for year one. 12 Detail of Appendix A Table 2 B. Please explain whether the university intends to operate the program through continuing educat ion on a cost -recovery basis, seek approval for market tuition rate, or establish differentiated graduate -level tuition. Provide a rationale for doing so and a timeline for seeking Board of Governors' approval, if appropriate. Please include the expected rate of tuition that the university plans to charge for this program and use this amount when calculating cost entries in Table 2. COP's goal is to operate the graduate program and use some of the tuition revenue to cover the cost of the fellowships and g raduate assistantships for PhD students . Thus, the income generated from the graduate certificate and Master's program will be used to subsidize the COP PhD program. C. If other programs will be impacted by a reallocation of resources for the proposed prog ram, identify the impacted programs and provide a justification for reallocating resources. Specifically address the potential negative impacts that implementation of the proposed program will have on related undergraduate programs (i.e., shift in faculty effort, reallocation of instructional resources, reduced enrollment rates, greater use of adjunct faculty and teaching assistants). Explain what steps will be taken to mitigate any such impacts. Also, discuss the potential positive impacts that the prop osed program might have on related undergraduate programs (i.e., increased undergraduate research opportunities, improved quality of instruction associated with cutting -edge research, improved labs and library resources). Year 1 Year 5 Salaries & Benefits Faculty Salaries & Benefits $350,000 $550,000 A&P Salaries & Benefits $90,000 $140 ,000 USPS Salaries & Benefits $58,0 00 $116 Auxiliary, $672,403 $909,403 13 There will be a realloc ation of current, planned and future faculty effort, and admi nistra tive staff resources to support t he propo sed PhD program from the School's existing E&G. There is no realloc ation of resources from any undergradu ate program. We do not have any undergradu ate programs impacted by the implementation of this program. COP offers a professional face -to-face PharmD program. Reallocation of faculty efforts will not impact the PharmD program, since all faculty have 12 month appointments and they are expected to devote about 70% of their efforts (0.7 FTE) for scholarly research and 30% (0.3FTE) to academic teaching . Thus, of the teaching efforts, 0.1 FTE they will devote toward COP Graduate Program in relation to didactic teaching . Also, since PhD students will be working with the faculty in their research project s (directed research), the faculty will cover 0.1 FTE effort from their research assignment. Currently there are a total of 34 faculty members in the COP, of which 12 are in the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences (DPS), all of whom have PhD degrees and post -doctoral and faculty experience adequate to guide PhD research. At least five (5) faculty in the group have nanomedicine educational expertise and a few faculty in USF Health have been identified as potential instructors of the courses to be offered ( Appendix E - Letters of Support). The College of Pharmacy plans to recruit four additional faculty members: two in the a rea of Translational Nanomedicine and two in Industrial pharmacy, who will be involved in the PhD in Pharmacy program. COP has also established joint faculty appointments with the College of Medicine (Departments of Molecular Medicine, Molecular Pharmacolo gy and Physiology, Internal Medicine and the USF Nanomedicine Research Center). As shown in Table 4, the existing DPS faculty will have minimally reallocated effort (0.05 to 0.25 FTE) . Thus, the PharmD education will not be negatively affected by the reallocation of faculty effort, the reallocation of instructional resources, reduced enrollment rates, or greater reliance of adjunct faculty and teaching assistants. D. Describe other potential impacts on related programs or departments (e.g., increased need for general education or common prerequisite courses, or increased need for required or elective courses outside of the proposed major). Because, there is no formal nanomedicine or industrial pharmacy programs or concentrations in the USF, we believe that this program will only positively impact the related programs and department by fostering and advancing interdisciplinary STEM sciences. There is no need for general education or other pre-requisite courses for this new degree program. Concentrations will be built from existing grad uate courses as listed in the USF Grad uate Course catalog and the new courses built for this program as outlined in the curriculum. Positive impacts of PhD program on Pharm D education . The courses offered through the PhD program will positively impact the COP PharmD program and other colleges at the USF including programs in the Colleges of Nursing, Medicine, Public Health, and Physical Therapy in the following ways. 1) Professional pharmacy, nursing, medicine and public health students may benefit by including certain courses from the PhD in Pharmacy program as electives and thereby broadening potential educational experience. 2) The interdisciplinary nature of the PhD in Pharmacy courses may provide curricular enhancement for MS and PhD students in engineer ing and all other STEM disciplines including chemistry, physics, and biology. For example, COP has already established a joint MS program with the Department of Biomedical Engineering in the College of Engineering as a foundation for the proposed PhD in Pharmacy. 3) The PhD in Pharmacy program will promote and enhance interdisciplinary research opportunities for students at USF by working in collaboration at the Colleges of Medicine and Nursing at the USF Health, Colleges of A rts and Sciences and College of Engineering. Also, these collaborations will 14 involve t he faculty, students and staff working at the Center for Research and Education in Nanobioengineering, The Nanotechnology Research and Education Core and the Center for Drug Discovery and Innovation at the USF. E. Describe what steps have been taken to obta in information regarding resources (financial and in -kind) available outside the institution (businesses, industrial organizations, governmental entities, etc.). Describe the external resources that appear to be available to support the proposed program. Currently no financial resources have been secured from outside of the institution to support the PhD in Pharmacy program. However, we have begun to form alliances with other institutions and with a number of local and national pharmaceutical industries w hich in the future may translate to financial and in-kind resources. We have also received expressions of support from the USF Nanomedicine Research Center (UNRC), The USF Center for Advanced Medical Learning and Simulation (CAMLS) and Center for Drug Disc overy and Innovation (CDDI) which may lead to grant opportunities. The collective organization College of Pharmacy Graduate Programs (COPGP) has made alliances with a number of pharmaceutical industries including Core Rx, Intezyne, Thar Pharmaceuticals, Novel Bio spectrum Technologies, Quoram Bio Innovations, Florida A nalytical Imaging Solutions , Saneron Bio - JInnovations, TransGenex Nanobiotech Inc, Lion biotechnologies to name a few. COPGP is in the process of creat ing an Industry Advisory Board with CEO s from Pharmaceutical and Life sciences companies and medical device companies in the in Tampa Bay area. Curr ently, there are 21 major pharmaceutical firms that are located in the Tampa Bay area; 17 are within 20 minutes travel time from the proposed new Colleges of Medicine and Pharmacy in downtown Tampa. Companies located in the proximity of downtown campus include th ose with <20 min travel time ( e.g., Merck & Co. , Bristol Myers Squibb, Xcelience, Abba Pharma, Intagras, Inc. , Basyshore Pharmaceuticals, Bausch & Lomb Pharmaceuticals and more ) and those requiring >20min travel time include: CoreRX, Inc., Eli Lilly, Alto Pharmaceuticals and Thar Pharmaceutical . 15 Our goal is to recruit all of our area industries, specifically those within the 20 minute radius of our proposed new college to work as partners making up an Advisory Board, which will work with COPGP to advance the Industrial Pharmacy concentration. This Board will advise and facilitate the Pharmaceutical Industries to partner wit h COP GP in the Industr ial Pharmacy. For instance , qualified industry personnel may serve as adjunct faculty in guiding students in this program. Also, through a memorandum of understanding established between the industry and the graduate program, a stud ent may choose research projects pr oposed by an industr y. COP has already established such arrangements for example with CoreRx, where a student conducted an industry -driven project that was funded by th e COP, CoreRx and the Florida High Tech -Corridor. COP GP has established relationships with several local organizations such as USF Chapter National Academy of Innovators, the companies at the Tampa Bay Technology Incubator - USF CONNECT, Moffitt Cancer Center in an effort to maximize research and innovat ion training of the PhD students in the program through internship and other training opportunity linked to their research program. IV. Projected Benefit of the Program to the University, Local Community, and State Use information from Tables 1 and 2 in App endix A, and the supporting narrative for \"Need and Demand\" to prepare a concise statement that describes the projected benefit to the university, local community, and the state if the program is implemented. The projected benefits can be both quantitativ e and qualitative in nature, but there needs to be a clear distinction made between the two in the narrative. Florida is a hub for the life sciences and is home to nearly 1,000 biotech, pharmaceutical, and medical devices companies. Annually ~$1 billion i s invested into life sciences R&D by Florida universities (NSF data). Florida is second among all states for FDA registered medical devices manufacturing facilities. According to the US Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Florida is third in p harmaceutical and manufacturing businesses and sixth in bioscience employment and higher education degrees awarded (Enterprise Florida). Florida has a strong standing in the innovation space and is trending in the right direction. Florida is ranked third i n the nation for academic patents per 1,000 science and engineering (S&E) doctorate holders in academia (NSF, 2014; Shaffer and Wright, 2010), 5th in the nation for S&E doctorates conferred per 1,000 employed S&E doctorate holders (NSF, 2014), 10th in SBIR awards over the last five years (www.sbir.gov), and 21st among the world's largest economies (Enterprise Florida, 2014). Florida's High Tech Corridor, which spans a 23 -county region in central Florida, is 4th among the top high -tech hubs in the country fo r open high -tech jobs, according to a recent analysis of labor statistics (Bright Labs., 2012). According to the Startup America Partnership, a national network of state initiatives, Florida ranks 4th in the nation in number of startups (1,000+), nearly 30 0 of which are technology -based industries. Of these, 30% are women -owned and 43% are minority -owned. According to the 2010 US census, Florida's population is more than 19 million, of which 61% are aged 18-65 and 74% have bachelor's degrees. The proposed PhD in Pharmacy (offered under CIP 51.2099 -other) program with emphasis on Translational Nano medicine and Industrial Pharmacy is unique in Florida and has its mission to bridge the gap between nanotechnology and pharmacy/medicine, providing students with advanced knowledge, skills and practical experience of the principles, technology and applications within this progressive area. Toward the mission of the USF and the State of Florida , the C OP PhD in Pharmacy aims to develop critical workforce needs in he alth-related professions in the State of Florida and to foster economic development through STEM. The proposed program will provide an additional means to carry out this purpose. Within five years of program estab lishment, grad uates of this PhD program who may be pharmacists , engineers, chemists or biologi sts will fill the severe shortag es for qualified academic faculty which are prese nt in numero us health professions curricula today due to the \"greying of the professora te.\" The ability to support the initiation of needed new programs or sustain/expand the capacity of existing 16 pharmacy professio ns training programs is essential in suppor ting the quality of life for the citizens of our state. Grad uates may also fill governmental or social agency admi nistrati ve positions involved in lead ing the implementation of the Affordab le Care Act or serve industry as innovation/product de velopme nt scientists consultants in the biotech and medical device companies located in Florida . This program has the potential to significantly address needs across a broad array of educational, governmental or industry positions which directly or indirectly contribute to our citizen's quality of life. V. Access and Articulation - Bachelor's Degrees Only A. If the total number of credit hou rs to earn a degree exceeds 120, provide a justification for an exception to the policy of a 120 maximum and submit a separate request to the Board of Governors for an exception along with notification of the program's approval. (See criteria in Board of G overnors Regulation 6C -8.014) Not applicable . B. List program prerequisites and provide assurance that they are the same as the approved common prerequisites for other such degree programs within the SUS. The courses in the Common Prerequisite Counseling Manual are intended to be those that are required of both native and transfer students prior to entrance to the major program, not simply lower - level courses that are required prior to graduation. The common prerequisites and substitute courses are manda tory for all institution programs listed, and must be approved by the Articulation Coordinating Committee (ACC). This requirement includes those programs designated as \"limited access.\" If the proposed prerequisites are not listed in the Manual, provide a rationale for a request for exception to the policy of common prerequisites. NOTE: Typically, all lower -division courses required for admission into the major will be considered prerequisites. The curriculum can require lower -division courses that are not prerequisites for admission into the major, as long as those courses are built into the curriculum for the upper -level 60 credit hours. If there are already common prerequisites for other degree programs with the same proposed CIP, every effort must be made to utilize the previously approved prerequisites instead of recommending an additional \"track\" of prerequisites for that CIP. Additional tracks may not be approved by the ACC, thereby holding up the full approval of the degree program. Programs w ill not be entered into the State University System Inventory until any exceptions to the approved common prerequisites are approved by the ACC. Not applicable . C. If the university intends to seek formal Limited Access status for the proposed program, provide a rationale that includes an analysis of diversity issues with respect to such a designation. Explain how the university will ensure that Florida College System transfer students are not disadvantaged by the Limited Access status. NOTE: The policy and criteria for Limited Access are identified in Board of Governors Regulation 6C -8.013. Submit the Limited Access Program Request form along with this document. Not applicable . D. If the proposed program is an AS -to-BS capstone, ensure that it adheres t o the guidelines approved by the Articulation Coordinating Committee for such programs, as set forth in Rule 6A -10.024 (see link to the Statewide Articulation Manual on the resource pag e for new program proposal ). List the prerequisites, if any, including the specific AS degrees which may transfer into the program. 17 Not applicable . INSTITUTIONAL READIN ESS VI. Related Institutional Mission and Strength a. Describe how the goals of the pr oposed program relate to the institutional mission statement as contained in the SUS Strategic Plan and the University Strategic Plan (see link to the SUS Strategic Plan on the resource page for new program proposal ). Institutional Mission The University of South Florida 's Mission is to deliver compe titive undergrad uate, grad uate, and professio nal program s, to generate knowledge, foster intellectual development, and ensure student success in a global environment. USF College of Pharmacy's (COP) Mission is to revolutionize health by innovation of patient centered healthcare through education, research, and service in addition to empowerment of students, professionals, and patients as c atalysts for change at all levels of health. The Missio n, Vision and Educatio nal Philosophy of the COP Graduate Programs , in estab lishing the PhD degree in Pharmacy, are wholly congruent with the University and COP Missio ns. USF COP is proud USF Health culture of entrepre neurial academic innovation and partnership defined by our \"real world, real people\" research and the creation of new knowledge applicable and valued at all levels of the pharmacy continuum. Indeed, the hallmark of the new PhD degree progr am will be to engage students from various bac kgrounds, educate them broad ly in interdis ciplinary and inter-professio nal coursewor k, and foster their intellectual development thereby prepa ring and strengthening our comm itment to the betterment of comm unity, regio n, state, nation and the world. SUS Strategic Plan The PhD degree program in Pharmacy strongly aligns with the FL BOG Strategic Priorities and Goals for 2012-2025; 1 Teac hing & Learning- Educating the next generation of faculty scholars and researc hers to populate the grad uate and professio nal educational programs which train the future health care workforce, increas ing the number of degrees awarded in STEM area of strategic emp hasis; 2 Scholarship, Research & Innovation- Converting university research in rehabilitation sciences into the commer cialization or improvement of products, such as mobility aids, prosthetics and therapeutic robotics, while strengthening the University's reputation for the quality of scholarship, research and innovation; 3 Community & Business Engagement- Increas ing faculty capacity to support a vibrant healthcare workforce. The PhD program will become the hub through which existing USF Health and Tampa camp us academic assets can leverage the full capabi lity of USF within the SUS in addressi ng the needs of Flori da's population thus enhancing our engagement with comm unities and business entities. University Strategic Plan The PhD degree program in Pharmacy is also strongly aligned with the USF System Strategic Plan Goals to: (1) create well-educated and highly skilled global citizens through our continuing comm itment to student success; (2) develop high-impact research and innovation to change lives, impro ve health, and foster sustainable developme nt and positive society change; (3) build a highly effective, major econom ic en gine, creating new partnerships to build a strong and sustainable future for Florida in the glob al economy and (4) provide sound financial management to establish a strong and sustainable economic base in support of USF's continued academic advanceme nt. 18 This PhD program is consiste nt with University goals of building world class academic programs and interdis ciplinary research by its very nature of capitalizing on the strengths of our many campus Colleges, Schools, Programs and Departme nts and leveraging them as an innovative and interdisci plinary degree program. The PhD in Pharmacy will ma ximize the resources of this metro politan research university in ng the societ of \"enablement-disab twenty -first century themes of Translational nanotechnology, and Industrial Pharmacy . ***SEE PAGE 7 {section B} at the TOP for more notes**** b. Describe how the proposed program specifically relates to existing institut ional strengths, such as programs of emphasis, other academic programs, and/or institutes and centers. USF is currently an emerging pre -eminent Institution in the State of Florida and aspires to be a pre -eminent University in Florida and AAU university in the Nation. To this end, USF is fostering interdisciplinary STEM programs and is currently pursuing a new joint Department of medical engineering. Being inherently interdisciplinary, our propos ed program in Translational Nano medicine and Industrial Pharma cy will directly advance these goals of the USF. As the newest in the constellation of colleges in USF Health, the College of Pharmacy is in the early stages of cultivating programmatic relationships internally and externally. However, there is no greater catalyst than the USF Health and USF to develop such relationships than a cutting edge program such as a PhD program in Pharmacy. Currently, nanotechnology and nanomedicine research at the USF involves not only all colleges and schools in USF Health, but also numerous departments within the Colleges of Engineering, Arts and Sciences and Marine Sciences. By providing a highly focused , on-line courses and a directed/ dissertation research laboratories platform for obtaining a PhD in Pharmacy , the Col lege of P harmacy's program expect s to strength en and support the propose d program to enhance interest by students in all areas of graduate education. A number of centers at the USF will provide the support for this program, which includes the followings: i. USF Cent er for Research and Education in N anobioengineering (CREN) housed in the College of Medicine, the CREN has 25 affiliates from USF colleges of Medicine, Public Health, Nursing, Arts and Sciences and Engineering who are collaborating on nanomedicine based pr ojects. Research at CREN focuses in three major areas: nanomedicine, tissue engineering and cell technology. ii. The USF Center for Advanced Medical Learning and Simulation (CAMLS). CAMLS is a 90,000 sq. ft. state -of-the-art facility providing professional heal th education and training for individuals and teams, all under one roof. CAMLS integrates simulation technology, education and training sciences, aviation science, team training, human factors and evidence -based practice into innovative programs with measu rable outcomes. CAMLS combines cutting -edge simulation with research and innovation to move the latest advances in healthcare into practice. iii. The Nanotechnology Research and Education Center (NREC) is a university -wide user fabrication and metrology center providing state -of-the-art equipment, professional support personnel and infrastructure to enable multidisciplinary research in nanomaterials and nanomanufacturing methods related to fundamental materials science, sensors, actuators, electronics, bio -systems, medical products, optics and integrated nanoscale systems. The Nanotech I facility supports researc h projects of faculty, graduate students, undergraduates, and industrial researchers . iv. Center for Drug Discovery and Innovation (CDDI). CDDI is a Florid a Center of Excellence serving the research community at USF and south Florida [12]. From concept to clinical trials there are significant challenges in the successful development of new pharmaceuticals and therapeutics. It is the mission of CDDI to assist research groups at USF and within the Tampa Bay area in overcoming some of the critical bottlenecks in early phase drug discovery. CDDI provides researchers access to specialized equipment not available in most research laboratories that is important for validating protein drug targets and the development of small molecule inhibitors. CDDI instrumentation cores offer a wide choice of analytical methods with application to the 19 general analysis of proteins and cells. Also, USF Health has made significant pr ogress in developing and implementing pre -professiona l interdisciplinary Master's degree programs, e.g. biotechnology, bioinformatics. While the number of students admitted to these programs has increased to 300 annually, the curricula have been mostl y course-based, NOT research -based. A subset of these students will plan to go a highly promising PhD program that allows securing positions in academia, industry and government sectors. c. Provide a narrative of the planning process leading up to submission of t his proposal. Include a chronology in table format of the activities, listing both university personnel directly involved and external individuals who participated in planning. Provide a timetable of events necessary for the implementation of the propose d program. The planning of this degree consisted of a two -step process: the pre -proposal process followed by the full proposal process. During the pre -proposal process, the concept of the PhD in Pharmacy was submitted to all required committees at the dep artmental, college (USF Health Executive Leadership Council), institutional level (Graduate Council) as a formal application. After the pre -proposal was approved by the Graduate Council, it was reviewed by the by the Academic Program Assessment Council, a USF System council. Following approval by the Provost and Executive Vice President it was submitted to the SUS CAVP Work Group for review. After approval by the Provost and Executive Vice President it was submitted to the Florida Board of Governors as par t of the Annual Work Plan and was added to the USF Work Plan. A meeting was convened between Dr. Steve Richarde, Director of USF's Office of Institutional Effectiveness, Dr. Shyam Mohapatra and Dean Kevin Sneed, both from the College of Pharmacy, to discus s the final submission of the full proposal in May 2015. Dr. Mohapatra submitted the full proposal Graduate Council on Septemb er 19, 2016. The application is expected to be vetted through several USF Colleges and finally approved by Graduate Council subj ect to receiving the letter from FAMU. The application will then go to USF's Academic Program Advisory Council and then the Board of Trustees Workgroup on Academic and Campus Environment (ACE) and then to the full Board of Trustees for final approval. Fina lly, it will end up with BOG meeting for the full approval. The sequence of events is listed below in a tabular format.

Describe the curricular framework for the proposed program, including number of credit 22 hours and composition of required core courses, restricted electives, unrestricted electives, thesis requirements, and d issertation requirements. Identify the total numbers of semester credit hours for the degree. Course Requirements: Ph.D. in Pharmacy with emphasis on Translational Nanomedicine and Industrial Pharmacy The PhD in Pharmacy, an interdisciplinary program accommodates all aspects of Nanomedicine and pharmacological science in the broadest sense of the term. This Program is open to participation by faculty conducting research in this area irrespective of academic affiliation. Currently, the major participant s are from the COP, department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, but also may include mentors from other Departments at the USF College of Engineering or COP -affiliated industry partners. This training produces scientists who are not only capable of doing indepe ndent research, but who can also work as part of interdisciplinary teams to solve important problems in pharmaceutical sciences.

Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University 1700 Lee Hall Drive 300 Lee Hall Tallahassee, Florida 32307 Dear Provost David, Please find enclosed a proposal to establish a new Ph.D. in Pharmacy with an emphasis on Translational Nanomedicine and Industrial Pharmacy at the University of South Florida. The proposed program will be a doctoral program in the state in the six - digit CIP (51.2 099) in other category. We recognize that FAMU also offers a PhD program in Pharmaceutical Sciences with same six-digit CIP (51.2099 ), with concentrations in pharmacology/toxicology, medicinal chemistry, pharmaceutics and environmental toxicology . Also, FAMU offers a PhD degree in Health Outcomes Research & Pharmacoeconomics. Based on a review of the FAMU catalog and PhD curriculum posted on FAMU's website, we believe that the proposed program at USF is sufficiently different from the FAMU 's PhD in Pharmaceutical Sciences degree. We would appreciate FAMU's review of our proposal to determine if our perception is accurate. The specific focus of the proposed program at USF is on Translational Nanotechnology and Industrial Pharmacy . The program will be research intensive focusing on application of nanotechnology to solve problems in discovery and development of pharmaceutics , pharmaceutical solid formulation, pharmaceutical nanoscale devices manufacturing and testing, manufacturing and delivery, regulatory science, p harmaceutics in preclinical and clinical research. Throughout the program, the emphasis will be on industry -based participatory research. I appreciate your time and attention to this important issue and look forward to receiving your comm ents and recommendations. Please return your letter by Monday, December 21, 2016.

Dr. Mohapatra, In response to your invite dated 09/26/12016 seekin g assistance in reviewing your graduate program, I hereby append my report to this letter. I wish you and your college a very good luck and ho pe the program is a success. If you have any questions, please feel free to cont act me. Sincerely, M. N. V. Ravi Kumar, PhD 1. NEED AND DEMAND FOR THE PROGRAM 1.1 Need for USF to have the program The proposed graduate program is aimed at producing skilled researchers to meet the changing needs of the pharmaceutical industry in the 21 st century leading to improved healthcare. The gradua te students will be trained within a multi-disciplinar y pharmaceutical environment, an area acknowledged as being internationally under threat from poor gra duate supply to the industry (DOI: 10.1208/pt0801019). Similarly, the graduate program will undertake the challenge to train a diverse work force to meet regulatory challenges that is cl early a deficit. 1.2 Community/Societal need Translational nanomedicines or other drug delivery strategies are expected to provide greater 'return- on-investment' compared to drug discovery. The cost of developing a new chemical entity (NCE) has soared from US$125 million in 1976 to an average of US$ 2.5 billion in 2016, with a lead time of 10-12 years to reach the market. In contrast, it costs ~$ 100 (US) million and around half the time to develo p a delivery-enhanced product with a failure rate tha t is only 20%, compared against an 80% failure rate for NCEs, many of which are discarded during clinic al development. In 2018, the industry is expected to have 37 billion U.S. dollars in prescription dru g sales worldwide at risk due to patent expiration and this is on the rise. This offers tremendous opportu nity to drug delivery companies to develop second generation drugs based on proprietary delivery syst ems. All the more, the delivery systems are increasingly becoming important even for the biopha rmaceuticals and vaccines. There is an urgent need for drug delivery systems that extend beyond t he economics of industry to the benefit of society by increasing patient compliance with medication, i n turn leading to improved therapies and a substantial 'return-on-investment' by reducing the burden of poor healthcare. 1.3 Need for the program within the academic discip line The changing paradigm in healthcare sectors, in par ticular the way medicines are discovered and delivered, are prompting radical and innovative thi nking. Though, most pharmacy schools offer traditional pharmaceutics, pharmacology, medicinal chemistry degrees, majority of the schools conduct translational nanomedicine research as is the case in all two existing programs in public universities in the State of Florida. Whereas, a private Universiti es such as NSU has programs in Molecular Medicine & Pharmacogenomics, Drug Development (Pharmaceutics ) and Social & Administrative Pharmacy. There is no written rule, however, majority of the graduate students going into these program are predominantly pharmacy degree holders, which is not negative, but remain mostly restrictive to traditional thought processes. Therefore, programs such as the proposed one, attracts students with diverse backgrounds such as engineering, physical s cience, medical, biology background who are keen to cross the boundaries between traditional scienti fic disciplines, will make it to the program. This kind of student pool will then bridge links between othe r colleges within and outside the USF. 1.4 Workforce demand for the program Despite being the third populous state, the State o f Florida ranks poorly in workforce, technology and innovation. Also, the current workforce involves on ly low-salaried jobs. This proposal uses the advances made in nanotechnology in the last decade as launch-pad to develop an 'out-of-box' interdisciplinary STEM educational program that lin ks the PhD education to the economic development of the state. A PhD program in Translational Nanome dicine and Industrial Pharmacy will certainly cater to the needs of the State of Florida, which appears to have a preponderance of pharmaceutical/ biotech/medical device industries. 2. QUALITY OF THE PROGRAM 2.1 Program structure A four-year and 72 credit-hour minimum is one of th e new trends in PhD education, which is really promoted substantively by the NIH and the NSF. Howe ver, realistically many programs in PhD in Pharmacy have a number of students taking 5 to 6 ye ars to complete the program. In this case, the program structure as outlined in the proposal, stud ents will complete ~70% of the didactic courses by on-line delivery system, which is highly innovative . This should make it possible for the majority of students in the program to finish their PhD Degree in four-years, if not earlier, as in the case of EU PhDs. This will also make it feasible for students to enroll in dual programs such as, PharmD- PhD; and PhD- MBA. 2.2 Curriculum The curriculum as described for both concentrations , Translational Nanomedicine and Industrial Pharmacy is very systematic and excellent. Most likely, new courses may be added, as needed as the program is approved and put into gear. Also, as the new adjunct faculty are recruited, new courses might emerge. Especially, the Industrial Pharmacy concentration might benefit from additional new courses in specialized areas such as the solid state pharmaceutics, and continuous manufactu ring and crystallization. 2.3 Anticipated changes in the discipline The program has a mission to discover and apply kno wledge to design, develop and evaluate innovative medicines leading to patentable technolo gies/polymorphs, this will encompass drug repositioning falling within NIH remit. The program aims to pilot an integrated scientific/complementa ry skill training scheme that not only addresses the l ack of skilled professionals in the field but also enables young scientists embarking on a research career to redefine the design and innovation aspects of the pharmaceutical sector from a new perspective. 3. QUALIFICATIONS OF FACULTY 3.1 Existing faculty expertise The current faculty brings in wide range of experti se from immunology to nanotechnology to basic pharmaceutics to conventional drug formulations. 3.2 Additional faculty expertise needed The program proposes new hires and it is important to recruit faculty in the following areas, a) Professor of Practice/Entrepreneur in residence, the goal her e is to get industry sponsored research, while help ing faculty and graduate students more towards entrepre neurial activities and start-ups, the way forward b) faculty in specialized areas such as i) polymer chemistry ii) solid state pharmaceutics iii) regulatory toxicology and pharmacology and iv) continuous manufacturing and crystallization. 3.3 Anticipated needs for future development Equally important is to build facilities such as GM P and GLP toxicology, such facilities with appropri ate expertise will make USF-COP a unique place for indu stry and academia collaborations alike. Infrastructure and critical mass building will furt her open up USF to The National Institute for Pharmaceutical Technology and Education (NIPTE) mem bership which allows to participate in certain collaborative programs only open to NIPTE.

Sincerely, Nicole Kuzmin-Nichols, M.B.A. COO TransGenex Nanobiotech, Inc. 16704 Tobacco Road, 33558, USA September 14, 2016 Shyam S Mohapatra, PhD, MBA Associate Dean for Graduate Programs College of Pharmacy, University of South Florida Tampa, FL Dear Dr. Mohapatra: Re: Collaboration with COP PhD program in Pharmacy On behalf of Transgenex Nanobiotech inc. (Transgenex), I write this letter in strong support of COP's proposal regarding the PhD in Pharmacy program. Transgenex's mission is to discover and develop nanoscale platforms and technologies for developing diagnostics and therapeutics methods against human illnesses. To this end Transgenex has developed a pioneering multifunctional nanopartical technology that combines nanoparticle-based delivery of genes and drugs, which constitute the next generation of drug delivery methods for a host of medical conditions. In addition, Transgenex has pioneered fiber inspired smart scaffold technology platform that enables development of multicellular tumor spheroids that fully resemble tumors in vivo. The latter technology is expected to aid in anti-cancer drug discovery and development and in predicting the clinical efficacy of drugs for personalized cancer treatment. Transgenex understands that the PhD in Pharmacy is intended to support bold and innovative approaches to enhance research and training, such that trainees get their best experience in the area of their research endeavor and confidently enter their coveted career, be it in academia (both basic research and professional careers) and non-academia (i.e., government and private sector). They get training that enables them for a robust biomedical, and clinical research enterprise. Transgenex has been involved with the University of South Florida's Internship program since its inception in 2004 and has contributed to top quality students, research associates and post-doctoral fellows. Its scientists and staff have acted as mentor contest judge, guest lecturer and advisor to this program and so have interfaced with the administration, faculty and students and the entire program. Transgenex is pleased to support this proposal through the active contribution of our staff to provide internship and training opportunities and mentor PhD students. We will also work to identify other ways Contd... Page 2 in which Transgenex may contribute to the success of the program. In addition to technology development, Transgenex has excellent track record in translating technology to marketable products and our research staff can mentor a student intern in market analysis, client managing team science, conflict resolution and much more. We expect that a successful PhD in Pharmacy proposal will strengthen relationships between USF and Transgenex, while improving opportunities for our students to gain valuable education and training to complement their graduate research training programs. We firmly believe that this initiative will advance the USF as world-class research training institution. Our success will also position us to better train our graduate students to join the workforce either in academia, industry or government. In sum, I appreciate the opportunity to provide support for your PhD in Pharmacy program at the USF. I look forward to our continued collaboration with USF and the College of Pharmacy Graduate Programs. Again, thank you for this opportunity.

Parke-Davis Pharmaceutical Research, Ann Arbor, MI. 2001-Aug 2004 Post-doctorate Fellowship; Pulmonary, Critical Care, Sleep & Allergy Section of Internal Medicine, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska RESEARCH FOCUS: Exposure to cigarette smoke is responsible for a considerable amount of pulmonary diseases including chronic bronchitis, emphysema, carcinoma of the lung, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and excessive alcohol consumption also contributes to the comorbidities associated with these diseases. COPD is the only chronic disease growing in mortality in the USA and afflicts over 23 million people where at least 12 million remains undiagnosed. Furthermore, veterans are much more likely than non-veterans to have ever smoked (74% compared to 48%). By estimation of the US Department of Veteran Affairs, chronic inflammatory disorder, including asthma and COPD, is a common problem among veterans, accounting for 16% of VA hospital admissions and a third of admissions to all VA medical services, driving the need to develop novel research strategies to address the pathogenesis of these disorders. Our lab focuses on mechanisms controlling repair of bronchial epithelium particularly, adenosine signal pathway and its role of epithelial injury in airway diseases associated with cigarette smoke and/or in combination with alcohol exposure. Adenosine, an endogenous nucleoside has been recognized as an important modulator of hypoxic, ischemic and inflammatory process critical to both tissue homeostasis and tissue injury. However, the mechanisms by which adenosine-mediated airway wound healing and repair occurs after exposure to injurious agents like cigarette smoke has not been investigated. In addition to understanding the mechanisms involved in adenosine-mediated wound repair our lab has a growing interest in targeting efforts to reduce existing disparities in mortality rates particularly associated with smoke-related lung diseases and lung cancer. We recognized mortality from all causes is higher for persons with fewer years of education and for minorities including but not limited to Black and Hispanic population still remains unknown, which diseases contribute most to these disparities.

Contribution to Science My research team has focused on how the immune system contributes to neurodegenerative diseases and how its modulation may delay the onset of these devastating diseases. My major expertise is in vaccine design and ant ibody development. I have received two patents from his research efforts and published over 30 papers in this field. By applying my immunology skills with the function of natural plants, I have investigated medicinal compounds such coffee and melatonin in AD disease modification. C1. My laboratory focuses on biomarker studies of clinical samples. I have discovered TCR V chain clonality (loss the diversity) as a new marker for AD. This research provides the great potential to identify stable biomarkers f rom peripheral blood system for AD diagnosis and prognosis. A patent has been awarded for this discovery: TCR Clonality as marker for Alzheimer's disease. Patent number: US 8,383,347 B1; Date patent: Feb. 26, 2013. C2. My group also developed several nov el vaccine approaches intended to address existing issues in AD vaccine development, such as an adjuvant -free vaccine with A peptide, the peptide -sensitized dendritic cell as a vaccine against AD, and a polymer -encapsulated oligomeric A peptide vaccine a gainst AD. I am now working on a therapeutic vaccine against AD that targets oligomeric A with nanoparticles as carriers. Such efforts have been published on several peer reviewed journals and a patent as well as one patent: 1. Lin X, Bai G , Lin L , Wu H , Cai J , Ugen KE , Cao C .

I been involved in several major projects, including a $15 million NIH project to fund the Alzheimer's disease research center (ADRC). I have established and am in -charge of the peripheral blood tissue bank of the Florida Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (FADRC) and has collected over 1000 clinical samples in the past eight years. The tissue bank has provided more than 300 DNA samples for the GWAS program organized by NIH. My lab also runs ApoE genotyping for all FADRC clinical samples and has completed over 600 tests thus far. This test alone has saved $350,000 of outside testing costs for the institute. Those tissue samples have contributed to 8 publications (including two JAMA papers, and one Nature Genetics).

The tissue bank has provi ded samples for the GWAS program organized by NIH. Dr. Cao's lab also runs ApoE genotyping for all FADRC clinical samples and has completed over 600 tests now. Dr. Cao' laboratory focuses on biomarke r studies of clinical samples. He has discovered TCR V chain clonality as a new marker for AD. His gr oup also developed several new vaccine approaches intended to address existing issues in AD vaccine , such as an adjuvant -free vaccine with A peptide, a peptide-sensitized dendritic cell as a vaccine agai nst AD, the first DCs vaccine in neurodegenerative disease, and a polymer-encapsulated oligomeric A peptide vaccine against AD. He is now working on therapeutic vaccine against AD that targets oligomeric A with nanoparticle as carrier. His research team has focused on how im mune system contributes to neurodegenerative diseases and hoped to delay the onset of those devastating di seases. Through years of dedication to his goal, his team has discovered that TCR can be used for early biomarkers for AD and PD, and also distinguished between PD and AD with TCR change in T cell subpopulation. He has also developed a peptide- sensitized dendritic cell vaccine against AD and PD. His major expertise is vaccine design and antibody development, so he believes vaccine will be the final solution for antigen related diseases. Dr. Cao also dedicated his time in nutraceu tical compounds in disease modification. Funding Information: Completed projects: 1. Function of Chlamydia infection in Alzheimer's disease (Co-PI).

Personal Statement I have related expertise and appropriate training in bioinformatics, computational biology, and pharmaceut ical science. I have published more than 40 papers in these research fields . These papers have been cited over 1,500 times (https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JOZ6iHUAAAAJ&hl=en ). In pharmaceutical science, we developed a novel algorithm for analyzing drug -drug interactions from MED LINE literature and it was published in 2015 in Scientific Reports . I have identified the molecular mechanism of several important drug/compounds including In computational biology and bioinformatics, I focused on the identification of reliable genetic biomarkers from microarray and the next generation sequencing data for drug efficacy or toxicity prediction and disease diagnosis. Fo r example, I have identified 56 gene biomarkers from monocytes to predict early -stage atherosclerosis using a machine learning approach. This work was published on BMC Med Genomics and has been rated as a \"Highly accessed paper\" of the journal. This achievement was reported internationally by news services including YAHOO, Brazil News, and HongKong News. I also successfully developed a new hepatoxicity prediction model that has been patented in the USA. In addition, I participated in the \"Brainspan Consortium\" which conducted a comprehensive study on the spatiotemporal human brain transcriptome using exon microarray technique and gene pathway analysis. This project has generated one paper published in Nature , of which I am a co -first author. I have also developed two important online web servers, TIBS (Transcriptome of Irritable Bowel Syndrome) and SEGEL (Smoking Effects on Gene Expression of Lungs). These two online servers are usefu l tools and resources that biologists without a bioinformatics background can use to investigate the effects of Irritable Bowel Syndrome and cigarette smoking on gene expression changes. I participated in teaching and research for Pharm. D students and und ergraduate students after I became an Assistant Professor at the University of South Florida. I taught several courses, including \" Drug Action and Biochemistry \", \"Pharmacogenomics\", \" Experimental Design and Biostatistics \", \"Bioinformatics \" and \" Medical Inf ormatics \". Since 2013, I have published three papers with undergraduate and Pharm. D students. In summary, I have the appropriate training and expertise to lead the project. B.

Structure Biology My research in structure biology focused on NMR and X -ray crystallography. I applied NMR spectroscopy and X -ray Crystallography in conjunction with quantum chemistry and other molecular modeling methods to identify the relationship between C13 NMR chemical shifts and structures of histidine residue in proteins. We also investigat ed the nature of these hydrogen bonding interactions using atoms -in-molecules (AIM) theory. In addition, I have solved the crystal structure of hemagglutinin from influenza B/Hong Kong/8/73 (B/HK) virus at 2.8 \u00c5 resolution. This structure provides a framew ork for a detailed understanding of antigenic variation of influenza B virus. Moreover, this structure reveals the molecular basis for the pH dependence and sensitivity to ionic strength of influenza B hemagglutinin. This information might be helpful for t he design of novel anti -influenza drugs, especially for bird flu. 1.

Personal Statement The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to develop a brain -targeted drug delivery system for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). I have over eight years of experience in studies focused on neurodegenerative diseases, and I have the expertise to successfully carry out the proposed study. I have used several in vitro and in vivo systems, and various biochemical techniques t o understand complex mechanisms to target pathological proteins in Alz heimer's disease and other neurological disorders. So far, I have successfully published 50 papers and applied for and secured several patent s. I have secured grants in the past both as PI and as Co -I. My currently active grant focuses on the therapeutic potential of Cdc37, which is a novel tau -regulating protein. My lab is always actively supporting training of students at undergraduate and graduate levels. I strongly believe that my unique expertise on chaperone proteins along with the expertise of Dr. Sutariya ( Co-I) and Dr. Kindy (Co-I) will result in successful completion of the proposed research work. Overall, I have the experience and motivation to effectively support the proposed study as the PI. B.

Assoc iate 1986 -87 Biology A. Personal St atement: With graduate and post-doc toral training in geneti cs and molecular biology/imm unology, I began my academic career in 1988 with research focus in biology of allergic-immunologic inflammation of the lung by cloning of allergens and use of recombinant allergens to regulate allergic immune response ( JBC 1992, JI, 1992, Science 1995, HGT 2003 ). This research expanded to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, which is also a major risk factor for asthma and potential of biologic/gene-based as therapeutic modalities, which continues to be research focus in my lab ( JBC 2002, Vaccines 2002, Nature Med 2005, PLoS One 2013, JCI 2014 ). In 2004, my lab also discovered the immunoregulatory role of the cardiac hormone peptide, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and its receptor NPRA. This research focused on developing various therapeutic modalities for allergic diseases and cancers. Devel oping novel nanomedicine technol ogies to advance translational science and transforming inventions from the lab benches to in vivo appli cations in pre-clinical settings and further to human c linical trials has been (since 1988), and continue to be my passion in research ( NEJM, 2001, JACI 2014 ). Since 2002, developing novel nanoscale biomedical technologies to advance translational science and transforming inventions from the lab benches to in vivo applications in pre-clinical settings and in human clinical trials has been and continues to be my passion in research ( NEJM, 2001, JACI 2014 ). My current research program s focu s on multi- disciplinary research developing and utilizing cutting-edge technologie s in immunology, cell biology, virology, nanotechnology (biosensing gene-drug advance diagnosti c and therapeuti c approache s in cancers, traumati c brain injury, respiratory syncytial virus, allergy and asthma. For this project on brain cancer, I have been collaborating with Dr. Sutariya since 2015 especially on the aspect of drug delivery to brain. As a co-investigator in this project I shall assist the PI, conducting the proposed project especially about the aspects of nanodrug formulation and characterization, nanodrug delivery to brain, in establishing the brain cancer model in rodents. Teaching has been my passion, since I was in high school. In regard to student training, as a faculty in medical schools since 1988 I have taught and supervised a total of about 100 students in my laboratory, which include about 30 undergraduates and 60 graduates (both professional and research graduates) and 10 high school schoolers. My students are well placed in academia, government and industry sectors in USA and abroad. In the last five years I have supervised and trained in research a total of five doctoral, 6 Master's and 3 undergraduate students, who have contributed to the publications (marked by '* or **') moved onto post-doc toral/faculty appointments and graduate programs, respectively. Currently, I am supervising two graduate students as primary mentor and two as a secondary mentor, two Master's students and one undergraduate student. It is to be noted that the proposed project stems from the work of doctoral level graduate students, who will be graduating within one year. B.

C. Contributions to Sciences 1. Development of biomedical nanotechnologies: a driving force for novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches and translational medicine. In 2002, while utilizing viral vector-based gene therapies for asthma, I realized that viral vectors for asthma may never get to the patient and started with biocompatible and biodegradable chitosan nanoparticles for gene therapy. I became fascinated by the power of nanoparticles and nanoscale advantages. Over the years, my lab has developed a variety of nanomaterials including nanospheres, nanowires, nanotubes and nanofibers composed of biomaterials to metallic and hybrid nanomaterials, that have been used either for diagnostic or therapeutic applications. Ultra-sensitive detection of antigens or microbes (such as the HIV test in 20 seconds) was achieved using nano-membanes to nanochips. Also, multi-functionalized nanoscale devices including theranostics for smart and cell targeted or organ targeted drug delivery that would deliver drug to difficult unreachable sites in human body. We developed a nanaofiber platform, 'tumor -on-a-dish' platform that promotes tumoroids from tumor cells resembling tumors in vivo. It is gratifying that my contributions to biomedical nanotechnology has been recognized at the national and international level with many awards including the election to \"Florida Inventors Hall of Fame\" in 2014 . a. *Aravamudhan S, Kumar A, Mohapatra SS, Bhansali S.

One of my early research and inventions involved intranasal gene transfer technology that used IFN-gamma gene therapy for preventing RSV infection. Further studies on downstream IFN-g signaling led to identification of the 2-5 OAS (oligo-adenylate synthatase), which has come to be regarded as a \" wellness gene \". OAS t echnology is being used to develop a vaccine/ treatment against a number of RNA viral diseases including Hepatitis C, influenza, RSV, dengue and others with billions of patients affected world- wide. I also designed and reported on the first nanoparticle genomic vaccine for RSV. Our other substantial contribution combines nanoparticles with siRNA for intranasal lung delivery against RSV-induced lung diseases and subsequent mechanistic studies involving innate immune mechanism underlying RSV pathology. My Lab also collaborated with Harvard Univ scientists on using stapled peptides to prevent RSV fusion. This fusion peptide technology has the potential to revolutionize prophylaxis of a number of viruses, which require a similar fusion process for viral penetration into cells including HIV, SARS, Ebola, Influenza. a.

Cancer research: Natriuretic peptide receptor A gene (NPRA) plays a pivotal role in tumorigenesis. The role of ANP signaling in inflammation led to the discove ry that ANP-signaling receptor, NPRA, was critical to tumo rigenes is in a number of cancer models and tumor pr ogression in 2008 (a collaborative studies with Dr. Subhra Mohapatra). Early mechanistic studies showed that mesenchymal stems cell (MSCs) and side population cells from lung express NPRA, which plays a key role in linking inflammation with tumor progression and later demonstration that MSCs could res tore the tumo r suscep tibility in NPRA knockout mice (Stem Ce lls, 2013) led to the i dea that NPRA signaling plays a critical role in regulating tumor microenvironment and particularly in proliferation of cancer stem cells. Given t hat NPRA t hemselves promote tumor progressi on, combining anti-NPRA based s trategy wi th other drug s that bl ock CSCs from prolifera ting and differenti ating powe rful, tar geted anti-tumor t herapeuti c approach. a.

In efforts to understand the role and mechanism of systemic immu ne response including leukocyte migration into the brain and release of pro -inflammatory cytokines; in a collaborative study between my Lab and Dr. Subhra Mohapatra Lab demonstrated that the systemic inflammatory reaction to TBI starts earlier than the local brain response and suggest that spleen - and/ or thymus -derived CCL20 might play a role in promoting neuronal injury and central nervous system inflammation in response to mild TBI. More recently, we demonstrated that chitosan and PEI -coated magnetic mic elles (CPMM) are potentially useful vehicles in TBI in a rodent model. Magnetofection increased the concentration of CPMMs in the brain and after intranasal delivery, CPMM did not evoke any inflammatory response and were excreted from the body. This technology has the potential to deliver therapeutic genes and siRNAs for other neurologic diseases and brain cancer. a. Das M, *Rangoni S, Pennypacker K, Mohapatra S and Mohapatra SS .

Allergy and asthma: Recombinant allergens and immune regulation. During my early faculty years at the University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada, I was honored with the Pharmacia Allergy Foundation Award, Paris, 1992 for my pioneering contributions to the field of IgE mediated allergic reactions using recombinant DNA technology (JBC 1991, JACI 1991). I demonstrated the method of producing recombinant allergens and using them for antibody reactions and T cell responses (JI 1992, JI 1992). I have continued to remain active and contributed to different areas of research pertaining to immune regulation, understanding of the allergen induced human T cell responses (collaboration with Sergio Romagnani) that confirmed the Th2 paradigm of allergy and asthma and discovering new diagnostic therapeutic approaches. In 2004 , I began st udies on the cardiac hormone pepti de ANP (atrial natriure tic pepti de), which had been h well known for regu lating blood pressure. Serend ipitously, my lab discovered a criti cal role of this fam ily of pepti des regu lating immunit y and inflammation. I contributed significantly to regulation of immune response and allergic disease by the family of cardiac hormone peptide belonging to the family of atrial natriuretic peptides. 7667628 c.

Educational and Academic Experience. I have had a very diverse educational background that has taken me all over the world and enabled me to work with both basic and clinical faculty. After obtaining a PhD in Genetics from the Australian National University, I was awarded the prestigious Alexander von Humboldt Research Fellowship. As an international fellow, I moved to Germany, became a fluent speaker as a diplomat of the Goethe Institute, and worked as a researcher. I then moved to McGill University in Montreal, Canada (learning French), before finally taking a faculty position in the Department of Immunology at the University of Manitoba. I was promoted there to Associate Professor before joining the Department of Medicine at the University of South Florida in 1996. One of the unique trends in academia has been the horizontal integration of basic research and clinical curricula to produce better healthcare professionals. My international training experiences have uniquely allowed me to interact easily with both clinicians and researchers from diverse backgrounds. In clinical medicine, I continue to teach medical and Pharmacy students (clinical problem solving, evidence-based medicine, laboratory research), co-direct a graduate certificate course in clinical investigation, and one on Pharmacy Practice Management and direct one course in 'Clinical Research Methods' and one on 'Micro and Nano Drug Delivery Systems'. In the basic sciences, I have developed a curriculum for MS and PhD concentrations in Allergy, Immunology and Infectious Disease. Also, have led the efforts to develop Graduate Certificate, Master and PhD programs at the College of Pharmacy of USF Health. 2. Diversity of administrative experiences: a) Associate Dean of Graduate Programs at the College of Pharmacy. The USF College of Pharmacy (COP) was established in 2010 to offer the Pharm D program. As the Associate Dean, I founded its Office of Graduate Programs in 2013 with the mission to create graduate level education programs in pharmacy producing global pharmacy leaders, one scholar at a time. The vision for graduate education at COP included developing cutting-edge research training and education including both didactic (on-line and in-class) in several areas of Pharmacy, creating a diverse learning environment for students and faculty and creating advanced learning opportunities using the emerging technologies Consistent with USF's mission, the strategic goals of OGP include i) to enhance domestic and international recruitment, enrollment, and retention of graduate students that reflects diversity, ii) to strive to enhance the academic experience of and the quality of life for graduate students, iii) to pursue research funding and conduct and publish research that leads to opportunities for graduate student success, iv) to partner with the other USF Colleges and SUS institutions to develop creative initiatives that promote graduate student research, and v) to serve as a leader in promoting interdisciplinary graduate programs. Under my leadership the College has developed several graduate certificates, a Master of Science in Pharmaceutical nanotechnology and a joint Master's program with Biomedical engineering and Pharmacy. Preliminary approval has been obtained for a PhD program in Pharmacy with thrusts areas in nanomedicine, pharmacogenomics and industrial pharmacy. Also, plans are underway to develop initiatives for a number of dual degree programs at the COP b) Member, Executive Council for Research and Education. I have served as a member of this senior-level research cabinet since its establishment in 2009. This committee makes all strategic decisions concerning administrative matters for the Office of Research including space, infrastructures, cores, faculty recruitment, financial decisions, and acts in an advisory capacity to the Senior Associate Vice President and Dean of the College of Medicine. c) Vice Chair of Research, Department of Medicine: I have served as the Vice Chair of Medicine since 2009. Internal Medicine is the biggest department at USF, with 16 Divisions (>70 faculty). The Vice Chair of Research is responsible for managing the extramural research portfolio of the Department and recruitment of basic and Shyam (Sam) Mohapatra, PhD, MBA Curriculum vitae 3 clinical faculty, mentors young faculty. Internal Medicine ranks second among departments in the College of Medicine in extramural funding, bringing in close to $13 million annually. d) Director, Division of Translational Medicine: I became the Founding Director of USF Internal Medicine's new Division of Translational Medicine in 2009, with the aim of capitalizing and centralizing translational medicine research in the Department. The Division has 5 core faculty and several joint faculty who have active research labs and are interested in translating bench research to pre-clinical studies or patient-oriented research. In this position, I have gathered experience in hiring faculty, faculty retention, administering faculty affairs, activity reports, and annual evaluations, and annual budgeting for the whole unit, comprising close to 40 faculty, staff and students. e) Director, USF Nanomedicine Research Center (UNRC): I became the Founding Director of the UNRC in 2009. The Center was created as a Class II center with approval from the USF Board of Trustees and is intended to develop and exploit USF strengths in nanotechnology and its application to biomedical arenas. The major accomplishments of UNRC include: i) twenty-four faculty across the University as members and five as Academic Advisory Board members; ii) four core faculty with joint appointments in other Depts/Divisions; iii) about $7 million dollars of extramural funding with about ~$3 million in expenditures in 2010-11; and iv) the 2010 NanoBio Collaborative conference held at USF (this led to publication of a special issue for \"University: Technology & Innovation\"). This will make my initial vision to grow the UNRC into a Class I Center of Excellence in the State of Florida to come true in the near future. f) Director of Basic Science for the Signature Research Interdisciplinary Program in Allergy, Immunology and Infectious Disease (2006-2011): This program has been a role model for all other Signature Interdisciplinary Programs in the College of Medicine and has been active in interdisciplinary research and education. In this capacity, I have been in charge of the graduate program in SIPAIID, including the PhD concentration in Allergy, Immunology and Infectious Disease. Eleven students have enrolled in the PhD program through SIPAIID since its inception and 4 more students are currently being recruited. This will make it as one of the top PhD concentrations in the College. The SIPAIID was also successful in getting a AIDS/HIV International Research Training Program funded by NIH, which is operating in India for the last 4 years. With a small investment by the College, this program has generated close to $10 million in grants. The program faculty have brought in >$30 million in grants/endowments. With the PhD Concentration in place, this program operates like a de facto department. g) Director of Research, Joy McCann Culverhouse Airway Disease Center: I joined the University of South Florida as an Associate Professor in the Division of Allergy & Immunology but soon became instrumental in the establishment of the Joy McCann Culverhouse Airway Disease Research Center. I assumed the responsibility of Director of Basic Research for the Division of Allergy and Immunology in 1997. At that time, the Division had one research faculty member and no funded research activity within the Division. I was instrumental to Divison raising two endowments of $7 million. Within a few years, Allergy and Immunology became one of the most successful divisions in the Department, as repeatedly acknowledged verbally and in writing by the departmental leadership, and also one of the best programs in the country, according to many colleagues. The research staff at the Center has grown to a total of 20 persons, including post-doctoral trainees and PhD students, an assistant professor and two instructors. I was also instrumental in making USF a participant in the ALA-ACRC Clinical Research Network. The annual budget that he handles regularly is close to $2.0 million. The research activities have been well supported by federal and state agencies and foundations and by funding from the pharmaceutical industry. The Center is now considered to be a leader worldwide in the field of asthma, allergy and immunology (especially with respect to RSV), with regular invited presentations at every major national and international meeting and at most leading academic institutions. Shyam (Sam) Mohapatra, PhD, MBA Curriculum vitae 4 3. Academic Entrepreneurship: I have been considered a role model in academic entrepreneurship. I have gathered significant expertise in administration with my position at a university spin-out company, TransGenex NanoBiotech, Inc., which I co-founded based on the creation of significant intellectual property. The company's mission has been to carry out R & D in nanobiotechnology with special emphasis on diagnostics and therapeutics. The company has obtained several STTR/SBIR grants and has several potential products in the pipeline. Previously, I served as the consulting Chief Scientific Officer for the company and now serve as Chairman of the Board. My academic entrepreneurship has led to USF recently taking the lead in establishing the National Academy of Inventors (NAI) (www.academyofinventors.org), of which I served as the founding Vice President. Since being founded in 2010 to recognize and encourage inventors with patents issued from the USPTO and enhance the visibility of academic technology and innovation, the NAI has grown to a robust organization comprising US and international Universities and governmental and non-profit research institutions, with over 3,000 individual inventor members and fellows spanning more than 200 institutions and growing rapidly.

My passion for academia is based on my personal belief that each student has the potential to bring something unique and special to the world. I believe in \"no student left behind\". Through education each student must self-discover his/her potential. I feel that it is an honor, and I take pride in doing it well. I inherited this attitude from my late father, a great teacher himself, believed that \"a good teacher teaches and the best teacher inspires\". My teaching philosophy is based on respect for the diverse learning styles and educational goals of the students with whom I have the privilege of engaging. I feel that this is best achieved by tailoring lessons to match a given student's learning objectives. Students are consumers of knowledge, and I would like them to get the best possible product. I also believe it is important to be accessible, responsive to and solicitous of constructive feedback, and open to change. I strive toward making my students life-long learners. I believe in staying as current as possible with my lessons to keep students excited and provide continuity to the learning process. I try to make students inquisitive about a certain discipline and teach them how to ask the right questions. I want my students to finish one of my courses changed for the better, as I learn from them to become a better educator. I started my independent faculty position in 1988, since then I have been afforded with a great deal of teaching experiences of a wide range of courses at both undergraduate and graduate level and of both research and professional doctoral students. The anonymous reviews by my students have been consistently laudatory citing my knowledge, teaching style, and enthusiasm as highlights of the courses. I have n tony experience in teaching in traditional lecture halls, but also in the recent \"Flipped Class rooms\" at the College of Pharmacy. I have routinely received high marks >4 of 5 and often 5/5 for my teaching from students. Specific examples of different student teaching are presented below. My teaching portfolio has comprised mainly (i) laboratory instructions and mentoring, (ii) graduate education and teaching and (iii) medical student education. My students have included high school interns, MS and PhD students, MD students interested in research internships, post-doctoral fellows, biological scientists, and research assistants. My goals and accomplishments in relation to these different facets of specific teaching portfolio are summarized below. Graduate Education: Given the multidisciplinary graduate program design at the COM, which allows students with diverse science background, who can get enrolled in a specific graduate course irrespective of whether they have completed the prerequisites, my goal in classroom instructions has been to orient my lectures such that the average student will have a good grasp of the basic principles appropriate for an intended course. However, in an effort to challenge the outstanding students in the class, I include a significant amount of detail and keep my lectures up-to-date with the latest information. In addition, I aim to make my lectures as interactive as possible and I am very open to and often seek student suggestions to make continuous improvement of the course. These have included from minor changes such as adding animations to my presentations to re-organizing the topics of the course on an as-needed basis. My goal is to be interactive not only during the lecture, but throughout the course duration by follow-thru discussion of topical issues by discussion forums conducted through the blackboard. In my opinion, a major goal of graduate education is to instill a scientific mindset so as to make them better professionals in any field of endeavor be it medicine, engineering, pharmacy, nursing etc. Therefore, graduate courses intend to transform students to \"think-like scientists\", thus they ought to develop the ability to critically evaluate the data presented in the papers they read. Therefore, I incorporated student-driven review classes of topical relevant papers into the curriculum of GMS6101. This challenges students of their understanding the experimental procedures and the limitations of the results and their interpretations. I feel this is an important factor as they progress through their scientific careers, so that they will not only understand how to evaluate what they read, but also to critically assess the results of their own research. Also, these review classes give the students an opportunity to hone their presentation skills so that they can present research to their peers in a logical and coherent manner. Shyam (Sam) Mohapatra, PhD, MBA Curriculum Vitae 21 Accomplishments: Since joining the Department of Molecular Medicine, I have participated in 5 team-taught graduate level courses on topics ranging from immunology, cell cycle & apoptosis to advances in nanomedicine during last three years. Foundations in Biomedical Science. My lecture pertained to \"cell cycle control & cell death\" Medical Microbiology (SIPAIID): My lecture pertained to cell-mediated immunity Molecular & Cellular Immunology (SIPAIID): I played a key role the development of a graduate level course GMS6101, Molecular and Cellular Immunology, and served as a section-director and currently serve as the Course as well as a Section director. Specifically, my contribution to the design of this course pertains to delivering the course as a combination of didactic lectures and student led state-of-the-art review classes. In the latter, students read pre-assigned current papers in the field and make oral presentations to the peers. It is gratifying to note that now in its second year, this course is one of the highly prescribed courses, with 19 registered students. MS Biotechnology. I teach \"Nanotechnology Applications\" and it has attracted several students to come to do voluntary internships in my lab. Another MS level undertook a research internship and then joined the lab, who has currently submitted a first-authored manuscript and he expects to join a MD/PhD program in 2012-2013. Medical Biochemistry. My lecture pertained to \"cell cycle control & cell death\" Medical student education: My major goal in teaching of medical students is somewhat different in as far that I aim to bring home to the students a complete picture of the case or clinical condition in discussion and develop a sense of logic and make them to learn why, how and what. Most of the medical student teaching I have done is done in small group setting. I found learning in small groups with other supplementary aids like multimedia led to a significant increase in learning and understanding with high degree of retention. The big advantage of small group discussion is no student is left is behind and everyone feels they are part of the entire process. The whole exercise shifts from teacher center to student center and they feel the ownership of the course and the exercise. When this happens, we can clearly notice significant increase in the level of self-motivation and I believe this is the first step towards making them a lifelong learners. Accomplishments: I participated in medical student teaching through the Colloquium (BMS 6920), which is more of a discussion based on current literature. I have taught and served as their facilitator for the following courses: Clinical Problem Solving, Evidence Based Clinical Reasoning II Medical Sciences 5. Medical colloquium related to \"Applications of Nanotechnology in Medicine\" Research Internship for MS-I ad MS-II; One MS-I student joined my lab for an internship in nanomedicine and still she is continuing this in MS-II Laboratory Instructions: My major goal as a mentor in laboratory instructions has always been to build the confidence of the students in doing science, which includes their being able to think for themselves, and develop an inquiring mind and being able to ask the right questions and importantly to learn fast and develop the technical expertise needed. To become a successful scientist, students need to develop a scientific bent of mind i.e., to learn how to think scientifically, how to design experiment and analyze data and how to present their findings to their peers. Also, a successful career in science requires a lot of dedication, sacrifice and perseverance in the face many experimental failures, typical for scientists. Really, as much as I have enjoyed in participating these courses as an instructor, as much I have learned from the clinical colleagues, who co-teach these courses and also the very fruitful discussions I have with the students. I am proud that it is having impact on certain students who wish to undertake research internships in their summers and extra time. Overall, I believe that great teachers are pillars of our society. I have been passionate about teaching since I was kid and I am delighted to have this opportunity to make a difference in the society I live. My plans are to continued excellence in both research and teaching as I strive forward in my academic career.

INSTITUTION AND LOCATION DEGREE (if applicable) MM/Y Y FIELD OF STUDY Nagpur University, Nagpur, India Pharmaceutical India Ph.D. 01/89 Pharmaceutics Sullivan University, Louisville, KY, USA Sullivan University, Louisville, KY, USA Executive MBA 12/09 Business Management MS 12/10 Conflict Management A. Personal Statement My research interest lies in the field of formulation and development of drug delivery systems especially using nanoparticulate drug delivery systems. My research career spanning over 35 years is focused on developing drug delivery systems for drugs which are hydrophobic in nature and pose a challenge due to their physicochemical properties especially related to solubility and partition coefficient. My doctoral work was on microencapsulation of drugs. Later I have worked on several approaches developing drug delivery systems including the implantable delivery systems, biodegradable and biocompatible nanocapsules, and nanodispersible drug delivery systems. I have several years of industrial experience developing and formulating drug delivery systems with specialized expertise in fine particle coating. Several products which I have developed are in the markets which are generic versions of the brand products. As a PI from KSTC I had developed several Nano emulsions of antioxidants for neurodegenerative diseases. Some of the drug molecules I have used and formulated successfully a stable formulation for two years include Physostigmine, morphine, curcumin, lipoic acid, resveratrol, Vitamin E, and many experimental drugs for cancer and neurodegenerative disease treatment which pose solubility challenges. Since I joined USF in 2010, I have mentored 5 postdocs, presently supervising 5 graduate students and more than 15 undergraduate students. I am also mentoring and supporting 38 faculties in COP as associate dean for faculty affairs. B.

NAME: Panguluri, Siva Kumar eRA COMMONS USER NAME (credential, e.g., login): skpang01 POSITION TITLE: Assistant Professor (Tenure -Track) EDUCATION/TRAINING (Begin with baccalaureate or other initial professional education, such as nursing, include postdoctoral training and residency training if applicable. Add/delete rows as necessary.) INSTITUTION AND LOCATION DEGREE (if applicable) Completion Date MM/YYYY FIELD OF STUDY Andhra University, Visakhapatnam, Singh University, Meerut, India Ph.D 01/2006 Biotechnology University of Kentucky, Lexington USA Postdoctoral 12/2007 Gene Therapy University of Louisville, Louisville USA Postdoctoral 12/2008 Cancer research A. Personal Statement My laboratory is focusing currently on two major projects, 1. Genomic mechanisms of Conditional Taste Aversion (CTA) learning, and 2. Effect of hyperoxia in cardiac remodeling. The taste research project is focused on the molecular mechanisms underlying learning -dependent modulation of ingestive behavior. For instance, a learned or conditioned taste aversion (CTA) occurs following experience with negative gastrointestinal consequences of ingesting a taste stimulus (e.g. nausea, sickness, or vomiting), which produces a switch from acceptance to avoidance of that and any like tasting stimulus. Utilizing this taste -guided behavioral model and several molecular biology techniques like whole genome microarray, quantitative real -time PCR, and in situ hybridization, I seek to identify genes in central neural circuits that are regulated specifically by gustatory stimulation, aversive visceral stimulation, and altered gustatory palatability. Thus, a complete underst anding of the molecular events (e.g. networks of genes) in the brain (e.g. networks of neurons) that underlie hedonic coding will make it possible to pharmacologically increase the palatability of less caloric dense foods (e.g. low sugar/low fat). As a Biotechnologist I have gained a wide range of Molecular Biology, Genetics, Genetic Engineering and Cell biology techniques during my graduation. As a postdoctoral scholar at University of Kentucky I extended my skills to develop Gene Switches for gene therapy application. I have also gained skills in cancer research and Neurobiology of taste in developing mice models, molecular diagnostic tools and identifying the neural content of taste circuit in CNS. With my extensive knowledge and expertise in molecular bi ology, I successfully administered the projects, collaborated with other researchers and published in peer -reviewed publications. The current application includes a large portion of molecular biology techniques to understand the mechanisms involved in hedo nic shift, which can be achieved successfully in time with my expertise and skills. The other project on cardiovascular complications under hyperoxic condition is focused on the cellular mechanisms underlying ventricular remodeling in hyperoxia -induced hea rts. For instance, cardiac myopathy is one of the major cause of deaths in critical care and ICU patients in US and worldwide. Utilizing hyperoxia mice model and several molecular biology techniques like quantitative real -time PCR, TaqMan assays, and Weste rn blotting, I seek to identify genes in ventricle that are regulated specifically in hyperoxic conditions and altering electric conductivity. Thus, a complete understanding of the molecular events (e.g. networks of genes) and regulators (e.g. transcriptio nal factors) that underlie ventricular remodeling will make it possible to pharmacologically increase the quality and span of life. I conceptually developed the study and performed the experiments in the laboratory by utilizing the input from the consultan ts. I lead the team here at USF, Tampa. Therefore in the past three years, I spearheaded the study and currently pursuing to understand the heart disease in detailed. In addition, as a student advisor for more than 10 PharmD students in our college, I hav e successfully trained 10 undergraduate, 6 graduate and three masters students for the past eight years of my research career (at Post-Doctoral as well as Faculty positions). Many students trained under my research guidance are currently in professional pr ograms such as MD, Dental (at University of Louisville and USF) and Pha rmD (USF College of Pharmacy). These students have completed their research training under my supervision and successfully published their research findings in peer -reviewed research jo urnals or presented their research in scientific sessions (abstracts).

As a postdoctoral scholar at University of Kentucky I extended my skills to develop Gene Switches for gene therapy application. I have successfully developed an exogenous gene switch with minimum side effects, which is commercially available as Rheo -Switch (http://66.155.211.155/nebecomm/products_Intl/pr oductE3000.asp ). I have also g ained skills in cancer research in which I successfully developed a genetic based cancer diagnostic system and also miRNA profile in cisplatin resistance of ecdysone receptor switches in mammalian FEBS J gene ligands on endogenous expression ).

Soon after I joined as junior faculty in Anat omical Sciences and Neurobiology at University of Louisville, I started my own research project in collaboration with Dr. Lundy to identify the neural content of taste circuit in CNS and to understand the molecular mechanisms of taste guided behavior. With my extensive knowledge and expertise in molecular biology, I successfully administered the projects, collaborated with other researchers and was successful in getting NIH R56 grant (multi -PI) in central taste processing from NIDCD. a) Panguluri, S ., Saggu, S. and Lundy, R.

In addition to develop novel research area in Neurobiology of Taste, I ha ve also collaborated with other eminent scientist in the department at University of Louisville and published high -impact peer -reviewed publications. Many of the techniques I published in this collaboration are very much essential for the successful comple tion of SA#2 and SA#3 in the current proposal.

Soon after I joined USF College of Pharmacy, with a team of collaborators, I initiated the current project to understand the ventricular and electrical remodeling in hyperoxia -induced mice hearts. Although a large part of research is already focusing on the effect of high oxygen concentration (hyperoxia) in inducing acute lung injury, we are almost pioneers in understanding the effect of hypero xia on cardiac remodeling, which mimics clinical settings in intensive care units (ICU) or critical care units . With the team of consultants and co -investigators, I have successfully published key events involved in the hyperoxia -induced hearts in peer -reviewed high -impact journals, which further initiated us to investigate the pathophysiological changes (by using e lectrophysiology techniques) and molecular regulatory mechanisms involved in hyperoxia treated hearts in the proposed application. Based on our key findings in this area of research I have proposed this research application with three specific aims, which will provide novel insights into the mechanisms that transcriptionally regulate Kv4.2 currents and their responses to changes in hyperoxic injury. These mechanisms can be utilized for potential therapeutic targeting of ion channels along with the pathways that regulate the cardiac functioning. a) Kakoti, B.B., Hernandez, D., Kataki, M.S., Shah, K., Pathak, Y.

Personal Statement Brain cancer is the leading cause of cancer related death in the US in patients under 35 years of age. The median survival time for brain cancer is less than one year regardless of the treatment method used. Despite surgery, external beam radiation therapy and systemic chemotherapy, these tumors tend to recur within centimeters of their or iginal location. The low efficiency of systemic chemotherapy is due to the presence of the blood -brain barrier (BBB) since most of anti -cancer drugs have lower permeability through the BBB. The purpose of this study is to use the brain targeted nanoparticl es of paclitaxe l for the treatment of brain cancer. I have been working with Co -Investigator, Dr. Geldenhuys on th is project for over three years. We have published several manuscr ipts including one in the \"Journal of Drug Targeting\" on the use of brain t argeted paclitaxel -loaded nanoparticles for the treatment of bra in cancer. My main role in the proposal is for formulation, characterization, pharmacokinetic analysis and brain distribution determination of brain -targeted nanoparticles containing paclitaxe l. In add ition, I am also responsible for compar ing and contrast ing the anticancer efficacy of paclitaxel solution with paclitaxel nanoparticulate formulation. As a post-doctoral fellow at Butler University, IN, I carried out targeted drug delivery researc h using nanoparticles and I have expertise on the developme nt of brain targeted nanopa rticles , which is supported by my related publication record. In addition, I am currently working as Co -Investigator o n two NIH grants (NIH R01 and NIH R15) where my role is on the development of thermoreversible gel conta ining nanopa rticles for sustained drug delive ry. As a result of these experience s, I am aware of the importance of frequent communication among st project members. The current application builds logically on my prior work. In this prop osal, I have chosen the Co -Investigator Dr. Geldenhuys, WVU , who provide s expertise in cancer animal model s and another Co -Investigator Dr. Shyam Mohapatra, USF, Tampa, FL who is an expert in nanomedicine. I have successfully advised Ms. Anjali Hirani as Ph.D. student and currently co - advising another Ph.D. student, Ms. Rohini Nimbalkar. I have published four research papers with Ms. Hirani as mentioned below and contribution to science section. In summary, I have demonstrated a record of successful and productive research projects in the area of brain targeted drug delivery system s, training graduate students and my expertise and experience have prepared me to be Principal Investigator of this project. 1.

Personal Statement My research background and expe rience is in the area of cardiovascular physiology and pharmacology . I studied the developmental regulation of L -type calcium and potassium currents in the infant and adult human atrial cardio myocytes. I developed the project entitled \"Redox regulation of Kv channels\" and worked on the shaker channel -subunits which belong to the aldo-keto reductase superfamily. I established that the Kv-subunits display tight binding to the pyridine nucleotides. I later established the link between pyridine nucleotides and Kv channels and received several grants funded by NIH and AHA in this area . I mentored graduate students, post - doctoral fellows and research associates for developing research career and apply for extramural funding. Presently the focus of my research is in ion channel regulation and cardiac arrhythmias and our effort s are to understand cardiac arrhythmogenesis. Based on previously established proof -of-principle concept, we are asking the key question related to ischemia reperfusion injury of heart in regard to pyridine nucleotide and redox basis I have a broad backgr ound and expertise in the field of enzymology, ion channel physiology, and cardiovascular research as it relates to heart disease . Also, I performed drug delivery research in cardiac drugs and anti -diabetic areas. Based on my research findings , I published in high impact peer reviewed journals such as American Journal of Physiology, Journal of Molecular and Cellular Cardiology, Pfl \u00fcgers Archiv , Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology and Circulation research . In the present study we propose that \" Nampt activa tion is anti -ischemic and anti -diabetic Our preliminary data identifie s that Nampt activator increases insulin release and attenuates insulin resistance. Using diabetic model we evaluated that Nampt activator P7C3 and the central role of NAD as a crucial link for both T1D and T2D. Based on our preliminary data we will evaluate the mechanistic basis and perform pharmacological evaluation for identifying potential therapeutic areas for cardioprotection . The project utilizes a multi -pronged approach in which we will use rabbit conscious MI model, physiological assays , cutting edge biochemistry and molecular biol ogy tools . The team consists of multiple PI's and consultant along with postdoctoral fellows and research associate . The research environment and support at USF is excellent for the proposed research goals. Over all the scientific background and experience in the field will allow us to utilize the core expertise from the fields of metabolism and translational physiology come together in understa nding the biochemical mechanisms to identify potential ways to protect the diabetic heart .

Contribution to Science 1. My research is focused in the area of cardiovascular diseases. I contributed to the understanding of how disease states such as diabetes and heart failure are regulated and functionally altered. We established that pyridine nucleotides are significantly changed under oxidative stress states such as hyperoxia, diabetes , and hypertrophy leading to higher NADH levels in the heart. The link between high NADH levels and modulation of electrical activity is novel and fundamentally important for developing beneficial strategies that can overcome the abnormalities in the heart . Currently based on the fundamental concept that Kv subunits display tight binding to pyridine nucleotides and are mediators of cardiac repolarization we have established the notion that the potassium channel are directly modulated as a result of metabol ic changes via Kv subunits. Research contributions with my role both as PI and collaborator have clearly moved the field forward. a.

PubMed PM CID: PMC4034463 . 2. Based on my interest in the area of redox regulation of Kv channels involving oxygen sensitivity imparted by Kv4 and Kv1.5 channel. I collaboratively initiated the project for identifying the role of Kv ( Aldo-Keto Reductase; AKR) subunit in sensing metabo lic changes in the heart. I published seminal work in this area which led to understanding that Kv subunits bind pyridine nucleotides (NADPH/NADP+) and modulate the Kv channel gating and kinetics. This work lead to the current paradigm establishing that r educed pyridine nucleotides [NAD(P)H] support Kv current inactivation and oxidized pyridine nucleotides [NAD(P)+] abolish Kv mediated Kv channel inactivation and modulate gating. I have also investigated the catalytic activity and mechanism of Kv2 subuni t and identified the substrate specificity and rates of enzymatic turnover. Recently we identified that deletion of Kv1.1 in mice leads to electrical abnormalities, hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy in female mice. We provide fundamental information th at Kv subunits are physiologically important and crucial for cardiac electrical activity. The impact of my contributions is supported by publications, citations, collaborations and funded research. a. Tipparaju SM, Barski O, Srivastava S, Bhatnagar A.

In addition, I have made significant contributions in the area of developmental regulation of calcium (ICa) and potassium (Kv4) channels in humans. I have identified and published that ion channel gating and mechanisms are starkly different in neonates, adolescents and adults. My contributions to this work as primary author or as co -author lead to publications in high impact peer -reviewed publications. My research primarily demonstrated that calcium channels are regulated by G -protein coupled signaling pathway with inhibitory signaling (Gi) being highly active in the human infant atri al myocytes whereas the stimulatory G -protein coupled signaling (Gs) is active in the adult cardiomyocytes. This discrepancy leads to the differences in the channel gating, kinetics and contributes to calcium channel mediated abnormalities and arrhythmias. In the area of potassium channels the research focus with my contributions brought fundamental knowledge that directly leads to our present understanding in terms how the potassium channel modulatory subunit KChIP2 is responsible for differential gating i n adult and neonatal cardiomyocytes.

Personal Statement I have a broad background in neurosciences, biochemistry, cell and molecular biology with specific training and expertise in the key research areas for this application that relate to stroke. I am therefore well qualified to direct the proposed collaborative studies. As a graduate student and later in post -doctoral training I gained significant training and expertise in pathophysiol ogy of disease. As a postdoctoral fellow, I carried out biochemical and molecular and cellular biology studies on c -fos and development. As an Assistant and Associate Professor at the University of Kentucky, I established my research program to investigate the mechanisms of neurodegenerative disorders and development o f animal models. For the last 13 years as an endowed Professor, Professor and Associate Chair for Research at MUSC, I have consolidated my research program and expanded my studies into the rol e and mechanisms in disease pathobiology with a focus on neuroinflammation and aging. I recently moved to the University of South Florida to provide the needed resources and collaborations to allow for a successful research program. Moreover, throughout m y career I have been involved in multiple collaborative projects. These include 2 program project grants, and acting as a collaborator on at least 10 -12 NIH -funded grants. In addition over the last 4 years I have been a collaborator/mentor on 2 Centers of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) and PI of an NSF EPSCoR grant. I also served as PI of a training grant from the NIA on the \"Biology of Aging\" while at the University of Kentucky. All of this extensive experience in collaborative research at multiple academic levels has prepared me to have a constructive role as a mentor in this proposal. In summary, I have a demonstrated record of successful and productive research projects in an area of high relevance for disease, including stroke, spinal cord injur y, traumatic brain injury , Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. My expertise and experience place me in an excellent position to meaningfully contribute to this application entitled \" Role of RAGE in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer 's Disease \". My expe rtise in behavioral studies in APP transgenic mice, biochemical analysis, immunohistochemistry and animal experimentation allow me to be the perfect person to carry out these studies. 1.

Contribution to Science 1. We have shown that RAGE, the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts which is a 35 kDa transmembrane receptor of the immunoglobulin super family which binds advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs), is involved in Alz heimer's disease (AD). We have shown that the interaction between RAGE and its ligands results in pro -inflammatory gene activation. Due to an enhanced level of RAGE ligands in diabetes or other chronic disorders, this receptor is hypothesized to have a cau sative effect in a range of inflammatory diseases such as diabetic complications, Alzheimer's disease and even some tumors. Our studies have demonstrated that isoforms of the RAGE protein, which lack the transmembrane and the signaling domain (sRAGE) and small molecule inhibitors counteract the detrimental action of the full -length receptor and may provide a means to develop a cure against RAGE -associated diseases. a.

RAGE Potentiates A\u00df induced perturbation of neuronal function in transgenic mice, EMBO, 2004, 1 -10. 2. Our previous studies have demonstrated that neprilysin, also known as membrane metallo -endopeptidase (MME), neutral endopeptidase (NEP), cluster of differentiation 10 (CD1 0), and common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CALLA) is a zinc -dependent metalloprotease that cleaves peptides at the amino side of hydrophobic residues. We and others have shown that NEP degrades the amyloid beta peptide whose abnormal misfolding a nd aggregation in neural tissue has been implicated as a cause of Alzheimer's disease. We have also shown that a non -membrane form introduced by lentiviral vectors can reduce A peptide and protect the brain from the detrimental effects of AD. a.

In addition, we currently are working with the enzyme cathepsin B, which causes numerous pathological processes including cell death, inflammation, and production of toxic peptides. Our focus on neurological diseases, cathepsin B gene knockout studies in an AD rodent models have shown cathepsin B results in the generatio n of Ab peptide and contributes to the pathogenesis associated with AD. In addition, cathepsin B inhibitor treatment of APP mice resulted in improved neurological scores, learning ability and much reduced neuronal cell death and amyloid plaques. Similarly, cathepsin B gene knockout and cathepsin B inhibitor treatment studies in traumatic brain injury mouse models have shown cathepsin B to be key to causing the resulting neuromuscular dysfunction, memory loss, neuronal cell death and increased production of pronecrotic and pro -apoptotic cell death peptides. a.
