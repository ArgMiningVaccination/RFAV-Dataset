Precautions to Take While Using Peppermint Oil for Your Baby It's important to use peppermint wisely as it could lead to other health issues. These precautions will help you ensure your baby's safety when using the oil: - Remember not to directly apply peppermint oil to a baby's nasal or chest area as it can trigger respiratory distress and bronchial spasms (sudden constriction of the bronchioles wall muscles that cause difficulty in breathing). - It is not advisable to apply an undiluted form of the oil to the baby's feet because of its potentially toxic nature. - Take care while exposing your baby to the oil as inhaling it in large amounts can result in dizziness, muscle weakness, nausea, disorientation, and double vision. Thus, restrict the quantity to bare minimum and also keep the room well-ventilated to avoid these side effects. - Always dilute peppermint oil with a carrier oil when using for babies. Be careful that your baby doesn't ingest it as it can prove harmful. The recommended way of diluting peppermint oil is to mix 3 drops of peppermint oil in 2 tablespoons (one ounce approximately) of carrier oil. For babies, you may mix 1 drop of peppermint oil in 2 to 3 tablespoons of the carrier oil. - Use carrier oils such as coconut oil, olive oil, sesame oil, avocado oil, sweet almond oil, etc. to dilute the peppermint oil. Ensure that your baby is not allergic to the carrier oils you choose to use. - Always conduct a patch test to check if your baby develops any allergies. Do not use the oil at all in case your baby has a reaction of some sorts and take him to a paediatrician immediately. Peppermint oil can be deadly when used in its potent form and also in excess. Thus, it is better to avoid giving it to babies unless a paediatrician specifically recommends it. The likely risks associated with the essential oil may outweigh its benefits when a baby's well-being is in question. References and Resources: Also Read: [Is It Safe to "}
