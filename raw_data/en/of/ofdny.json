It has a responsibility, enshrined in its Charter, to provide media services that are accessible by all Australians and to tell the stories of the nation and its people. The ABC does this many times every hour of every day, through its comprehensive suite of programs and services across its Local and National radio networks, its television services, and on digital and social media platforms. The ABC, on its wide range of platforms, constitutes a shared public space for telling Australian stories at a time when such shared public spaces are becoming harder to find. Breaking stories Providing independent news and information for all Australians is central to the ABC's role as a national public broadcaster. Throughout 2013-14, the Corporation delivered high-quality, trustworthy news and current affairs across radio, television and online, including comprehensive news coverage on ABC News 24. With additional funding of $59.4 million over three years granted in the 2013-14 budget, as well as $10 million received in 2012-13, the Corporation enhanced its newsgathering capabilities, particularly in outer-metropolitan and regional Australia. Underlying this role is a strong commitment to impactful, original journalism. During the year, the ABC's extensive network of journalists around the country and the world broke hundreds of stories, ranging from matters of local significance to important national events. The Corporation's Geelong bureau delivered sustained coverage of the economic and social consequences of the announced closures of the key industrial foundations of Victoria's second city, including Ford and Alcoa. In Darwin, the ABC revealed tensions within the Northern Territory Government over election promises to bush electorates and followed the story as three Indigenous members resigned, putting the Government at risk of governing in minority. An investigation by the ABC's National Reporting Team highlighting failures of the residential care system led to an inquiry by the Victorian Commissioner for Children and Young People into the abuse of vulnerable wards of the state. In 2013-14, Four Corners continued its fearless investigative journalism. Among its many investigations, Four Corners followed the trail of the people smugglers responsible for the deaths of 72 asylum seekers, mostly from Lebanon, when their boat capsized in September 2013. The international significance of this story was highlighted when the ABC licensed the program to Tele Liban for broadcast in Southern Lebanon. Foreign Correspondent offered a comprehensive analysis of the plight of jailed Australian journalist Peter Greste, gaining the trust of his family members and key players in the wider story of a struggle between Egyptian authorities and his employer, the broadcaster Al Jazeera. Stories that only the ABC tells Alongside its independent news coverage, the Corporation contributes to the diversity of Australia's media through the unique range of the subjects and perspectives that its programming offers. Each year, there are numerous programs that only the ABC would make, and stories that only it would tell. During 2013-14, the Corporation delivered an array of programs reflecting the diverse experiences of contemporary Australians. It was proud to bring the stories of contemporary Indigenous life to a broad audience through the second series of the prime -time I ndigenous television drama, Redfern Now. Through the annual Heywire initiative, it collected and broadcast the experiences of regional youth on triple j and Local Radio. The documentary Suicide and Me presented the contemporary issue of youth suicide. The ABC extensively covered the Royal Australian Navy International Fleet Review, which celebrated the 100th anniversary of the first entry of the fleet into Sydney Harbour, including live coverage of the arrival of the ships on ABC News 24 and a live broadcast of the final fireworks display on ABC1. A wide range of ABC programs explored Australian history and culture. The three-part television series The Art of Australia , hosted by Edmund Capon, explored how art and artists helped to shape Australia's national identity, while the documentary First Footprints traced the history of the Australian continent from the arrival of the first Australians 50 000 years ago. In June, as part of the ABC's commemoration of the Centenary of the First World War, RN hosted World World War One: Memory, Perception and 10 Contested Questions , an extended examination of ten critical and contentious questions about the Great War that drew on the insight of historians, writers and thinkers from around the globe. ABC Open and RN partnered with the National Museum of Australia on a year-long project, Object Stories , in which the public is contributing to a \"virtual museum\" of Australian objects and the stories associated with them. In Keating , a candid four-part interview series with Kerry O'Brien, former Prime Minister Paul Keating revealed the forces that shaped his ambitions and some of the inside stories of Australian political history.The ABC delivered comprehensive coverage of the 2013 Federal Election campaign, broadcasting more than 460 interviews, 129 panel discussions and 112 press conferences throughout the campaign. ABC Local Radio stations conducted 94 debates, panels, forums, outside broadcasts and other \"meet the candidates\" events to make political dialogue local and accessible to listeners. The Corporation also introduced Vote Compass, an online survey of voter attitudes that attracted more than 1.4 million responses over the course of the campaign. Vote Compass was the largest survey of its kind ever undertaken in Australia and provided rich insights into i ssues that shaped the Election. Throughout the year, the Corporation used the ABC Extra \"pop up\" radio station on digital radio and online to mark special events and anniversaries, including A NZAC Day, the Lunar New Year, NAIDOC and Reconciliation Weeks, TEDx Sydney and commemorations of the 10th anniversary of the death Slim Dusty and the 50th anniversary of The Beatles' 1964 concert tour of Australia. During the year, the ABC updated its industry -le ading catch-up television service, iview, to improve the audience experience. The popularity of iview continues to grow and the Corporation welcomed the allocation of an additional of $30 million over three years to support digital content delivery that it received in the 2013-14 budget. In April, the ABC relaunched Dig Radio as Double J, a new service targeting over-30 audiences with a full suite of programs and presenters. Double J is available through digital radio, online streaming and the ABC Radio mobile app. The ABC continued to encourage and promote Australian music across its radio networks. triple j Unearthed, which creates exposure and airplay opportunities for unsigned Australian musicians, launched an enriched version of its website during the year, while the ABC Local Radio, ABC Open and ABC Television collaborated on Exhumed , a nationwide competition for unsigned and unrecorded amateur musicians over 30 years old. In November, Classic FM and triple j celebrated the diversity and richness of Australian music through Australian Music Month.2014-15 Budget The Board was disappointed that, contrary to pre-election statements made by the Prime Minister, the 2014-15 Budget, handed down in May, included a 1% reduction in the Corporation's base funding. The Minister for Communications, the Hon. Malcolm Turnbull MP, described this cut as a \"down payment\" on future funding reductions. In addition, the Government announced it would terminate the contract between the ABC and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) for the operation of the Australia Network Service. Together, the announced cuts will amount to a budget reduction of $120 million over the next four years. The ABC has commenced a detailed program of work to examine the best way of meeting these and anticipated further funding cuts, including a fundamental re-organisation of its international se rvice. In the early months of 2014, the Corporation participated in an Efficiency Study of the public broadcasters conducted by the Department of Communications. The draft report of that study suggested areas of the ABC's activities that might yield efficiency savings. At the request of the Minister, the Corporation is considering those suggestions within its wider response to reduced funding. The Board is satisfied that the ABC provides value for money to the Australian community. The full suite of services\u2014radio, television and digital, both domestic and international\u2014costs roughly $120 per household per year. This compares to a cost of $300 per household for the basic pay-TV package\u2014even after that was cut in half just before this Report went to press\u20142.5 times more. International broadcasting 2013-14 was a year of significant achievement and profound disappointment for the ABC's International broadcasting activities. The disappointment was the decision to terminate the Agreement between the ABC and DFAT, entitled Funding Agreement for the Provision of an Integrated Multiplatform International Media Service . Unlike the previous agreement that operated between 2006 and 2012, and unlike the public tender of 2011, this Agreement did not provide funding restricted to a television service. The DFAT funding was for an Australia Network Service, extending across television, radio and digital services. This was a fundamental change.16 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2014 About the ABC 17Board Directors' statement During the year, the Corporation had reorganised its previously separate international media activities into a converged service to better meet the needs of audiences in Asia and the Pacific and to implement the letter and spirit of the new Agreement. It expanded its digital offerings, launching market -facing and in-language websites and mobile applications. It also realised a number of partnerships with regional media organisations, including signing a major agreement to extend collaboration with the Shanghai Media Group. The new agreement will enable higher-value international co-productions and cooperation in drama and children's production, as well as paving the way for the ABC to establish a business presence in Shanghai and to connect to China on digital platforms. Through syndication agreements, the ABC expanded the potential reach of ABC international programming across target markets, including a month of programming to a potential audience of 100 million people via the free-to-air television networks of Indonesia's largest media company, MNC. Further, the Corporation filmed episodes of Q&A in Jakarta, Delhi and Shanghai that discussed attitudes and relations between Australia and the three host countries; the episodes were broadcast into the Region and domestically. Against this background of successful implementation of the new form of agreement, the Board believes that termination of the Australia Network Service contract was short-sighted. The transmission of programs to countries outside Australia, to both expatriate and local audiences, is an important element of the ABC's Charter obligations. It actively promotes understanding and awareness of the Australian nation among its neighbours, as well as keeping Australian families living overseas in touch with home. The Corporation remains committed to offering the best possible service that it can afford to international audiences and is examining the most effective configuration of its international activities to do so within available funding. A particularly disappointing aspect of the termination of the Agreement was the failure to consult with the ABC about the costs of doing so. Under the Agreement DFAT was obliged to pay those costs, subject to receiving an appropriation for that purpose. The 2014-15 Budget made an appropriation for continuation of the Service until the expiry of the required notice and for the costs of terminating third party contracts, including staff redundancies. The amount appropriated was fixed without any consultation with the ABC. It was several million dollars less than the amount required. The difference, which will be determined when the redundancy process is complete, represents a further cut. Board Directors Dr Julianne Schultz AM was appointed a Director for a five-year term that expired on 26 March 2014. The Board would like to thank Dr Schultz for her contribution during her term as a Director. At the end of the reporting period, the vacancy created by her departure had yet to be filled. The Board has throughout the year maintained an active oversight role across ABC operations and accountabilities to ensure the Corporation performs efficiently and with maximum benefit to the people of Australia, as required under section 8 of the ABC Act. \" Each year, there are numerous programs that only the ABC would make, and stories that only it would tell.\" James Spigelman ABC Chairman Organisational structure ABC Board Managing Director Mark Scott Director Radio Kate DundasDirector Television Richard Finlayson Director Innovation Angela ClarkDirector Corporate Affairs Michael Millett Head Editorial Policies Alan Sunderland Director Communications Network Adrian PotterDirector News Kate TorneyDirector Legal and Business Affairs Rob Simpson CEO ABC International Lynley MarshallDirector People Samantha Liston Head Audience and Consumer Affairs Kirsten McLiesh Director ABC Resources David Cruttenden Director Business Services Brian JacksonDirector ABC Commercial Robert PattersonChief Operating Officer David Pendleton Head Group Audit Alison HamillABC Advisory Council Director Audience and Marketing Leisa Bacon WHS Project Manager Linda TaylorDirector Technology Ken GallacherDirector Corporate Strategy and Planning David Anderson State / Territory Directors ACT\u2014Elizabeth McGrath NSW\u2014Peter Longman NT\u2014Christopher Yates (a) Mambers of the ABC ExecutiveOrganisational structure as at 30 June 201418 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2014 About the ABC 19ABC Executive Management of the ABC is the responsibility of a team of Executive Directors.

There are some conditions\u2014such as escalating business costs, fragmentation of audiences and flourishing global competition\u2014that are common to all Australian media organisations, commercial and public. The pace of change in a digital media environment is accelerated. This increasingly affects patterns of media use and audience behaviour to which, once more, every media enterprise must respond. Other conditions, such as the scale and nature of changes to ABC funding, are unique. The ABC's funding was first reduced in the May 2014 Federal Budget. As indicated by Government at the time, further reductions will follow. The Government has not yet indicated either the extent or the duration of the second funding reduction it intends for the ABC. It has indicated it believes this cut should be funded by efficiency savings. The ABC is at a point in a very disruptive digital environment, when media organisations most need agility, flexibility and quick responses to the changes happening all around us. The absence of critical information regarding the extent of the ABC's funding has considerably compromised the Corporation's capacity to plan for the future. Previously, the ABC has applied existing funds to existing services and funds for new services were found through productivity and efficiency reforms. Innovations created with efficiency savings\u2014such as the popular and highly valued services iview and ABC News 24\u2014have been part of a uniquely successful digital strategy to ensure the ABC remains relevant to Australian audiences. Innovation, as demanded by the ABC's Charter, has been key to the Corporation's unique success with digital media. It is an achievement that Australia's commercial media organisations have been unable to emulate. The ABC must now, with no further access to funds found through efficiency gains, find funds to allow it to invest in innovation, keeping up with rapidly evolving audience needs and interests. Rising costs within the media industry will add to the magnitude of the ABC's challenges this year. Like other Australian media organisations, the ABC faces continually increasing essential costs such as electricity, insurance, television production and acquired programs. We believe the ABC can meet this range of challenges only through significant rethinking of the organisation's present business model. A shift\u2014from disparate platform strategies to an integrated content strategy\u2014will enable the ABC to better reflect audience interests, behaviour and demands in an era of abundant media choices. ABC audiences in online and mobile have, over the course of the year, continued to grow. In the year ahead, the ABC will realign internal investments to reflect this audience growth. Such a fundamental transformation of the organisation will result in a period of some dislocation and uncertainty. The ABC, its audiences and its staff would benefit from having greater clarity around the extent of the reductions the Government plans to make to its budget and the security of knowing what its operating revenue is. However, we are confident that after this period of considerable challenge and change, the ABC will emerge renewed and, with a stronger audience focus, better able to meet the growing needs of the Australian public in the digital era.ABC strategic objectives The ABC's strategic direction in 2013-14 was guided by the ABC Strategic Plan 2013 -16 . The Plan is framed around the following six strategic goals: Being audience focusedTo provide a range of media experiences to meet the needs and expectations of diverse audiences. Being high quality To consistently deliver content which reflects the ABC's commitment to quality, independence and high editorial standards. Being innovative To pursue new ideas, opportunities and partnerships, and grow our capabilities for the future. Being values based To demonstrate ABC Values in every aspect of our work. Being efficient To maximise the efficient and effective use of resources. Being responsible To be visible and active in the community, setting high standards of social, environmental and regulatory responsibility. The ABC's performance against these goals is reported at page 118. Reporting the ABC's performance The ABC strives to maintain the highest standards in every aspect of its operations. The Board and the Executive set those standards in the ABC's Values, its Strategic Plan and in its divisional business planning; Government sets them when funding is granted; and most significantly, audiences set them every time they turn to the ABC to be informed, engaged or entertained. The remainder of this report demonstrates the ABC's performance on all of those levels. 24 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Audience Experiences 25 2AUDIENCE EXPERIENCES Contents: Audience trends 26 Online and mobile 29 Television 38 Radio 48 News and current affairs 53 International services 60 Consumer experiences 65 The ABC shares stories from Australians like Maddie, connecting communities and contributing to our national identity.

Australians value content that recognises and reinforces Australian identity, character and cultural diversity. The ABC delivers content that reflects local and national perspectives, and provides opportunities for audiences to participate in the national conversation. ABC initiatives like Heywire give regional youth a voice, and invite them to share thoughts, ideas and opinions with their peers across the country.

Hunter, NSW.26 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Audience Experiences 27 Audience trends The ABC's combined national weekly audience reach across television, radio and online was estimated to be 71% in 2014. This is similar to the ABC's reach in 2013, which was 73%. 1 Community satisfaction The annual Newspoll ABC Appreciation Survey2 provides insights into community perceptions and beliefs about the value of the ABC's contribution to Australian society. The 2014 survey was conducted nationally, by telephone, among a random sample of 1 902 respondents aged 14 years and over. The ABC Appreciation Survey has been conducted using the same methodology since its inception in 1998. Overall community sentiment remains unchanged compared with 2012-13. A large majority of Australians (84%) believe the ABC performs a valuable role. A large majority also believe it provides quality content, and is doing a good job satisfying its Charter oblig ations. The respondents were asked about their views on the quality of ABC Television, ABC Radio and ABC Online. Consistent with previous surveys, most Australians (78%) remain of the view that ABC Television provides good quality programming, and about two-thirds feel it does a 'good job' in terms of the number of shows it provides that they personally like to watch. In contrast, 43% describe the quality of commercial television as 'good'. Overall for ABC Radio, 61% of Australians believe the quality of programming on ABC Radio is 'good' compared to 64% in 2012-13. Positive sentiment about ABC Radio has increased again among 35 to 49 year-olds after a dip in 2012-13. Conversely, positive sentiment has dropped among people aged 50 years and over. This follows a brief respite in 2013 from a general downward trend among this age group in recent years. 1.

Source: Newspoll, ABC Appreciation Survey 2014.84 % of Australians believe the ABC provides a valuable service to the communityApproximately half (51%) of the population believes that commercial radio offers good quality programming, equal to the previous year. There continues to be a greater similarity in Australians' overall perceptions about the quality of ABC and commercial radio than in their perceptions about the quality of ABC and commercial television. This reflects the more fragmented and niche radio market, where audiences have a very wide choice of stations to liste n to. The vast majority of ABC Online users (90%) believe the quality of content is 'good', up from 86% last year, with an increasing number (37% this year) rating the quality as 'very good'. Nine-in-ten users also feel that ABC Online does a 'good job' on the amount of content it provides, with 41% describing it as 'very good'. There is no significant change compared with last year. Frequent users of ABC Online are more enthusiastic in their rating of the site, and female users are a little more likely than male users to rate the site as 'very good' on both the volume and quality of content.The ABC Appreciation Survey explores public perceptions about the ABC's performance in relation to specific aspects of the Corporation's Charter. The majority of Australians remain of the view that the ABC is doing a 'good job' fulfilling its various Charter obligations. This is similar to last year; however there have been some subtle shifts in perceptions over time. Slightly fewer now believe the ABC does a 'good job' in certain areas including broadcasting programs that are different from commercial television or radio, and having a good balance between wide appeal and special interest programs. These shifts reflect the continuing fragmentation of media, offering audiences an ever increasing range of content from which to choose. Community perceptions about the coverage of regional news and information remain far more favourable for the ABC than for commercial media both among people in capital cities and people residing in country or regional areas. 80% of Australians believe that the ABC does a 'good job' covering country and regional issues compared with 46% for commercial media.

Australians today are more connected than ever before. Almost half of Australian households own four or more internet enabled devices and Australians spend on average a full day every week online; more than 3.5 times longer than they did ten years ago. 3 The ABC is responding to this shift by developing strategies which prioritise investment in online and mobile delivery of content and services. The ABC reached an average of 3.8 million online users a month. 4 There was an average of six million domestic and international visitors each week to the ABC's online properties, up 29% on 2012-13. 5 Visits in 2013-14 were up 36% on 2012-13 to an average 13.5 million per week.6 3.

The service enables the ABC to recognise an individual audience member across ABC online services and on multiple devices, in order to deliver a more personalised and relevant experience. The system went live on the iview website in March 2014 after a pilot period on ABC Splash . It will gradually replace the existing ABC Communities login on other sites during 2014-15. Children's content In 2013-14, online viewing of children's content increased. There were 14 million online plays of children's episodes on average per month, up from 10 million in 2012-13. This increase is due primarily to the growth in children's viewing via iview, which accounts for an average of 11 million plays per month (up from 7 million in 2012-13). Conversely, online plays via ABC children's websites have decreased by 13% from 2012-13. The top ABC4Kids programs viewed online included Peppa Pig, Play School and Ben & Holly's Little Kingdom . In order to meet audiences for children's content where they are, the ABC is working on large scale mobile initiatives to create a highly engaging, integrated and scalable ecosystem serving digital content across a range of mobile touch points. The launch of ABC4Kids mobile website in April 2014 had immediate impact, with a 31% increase in site visits to June 2014. 8 82 % of ABC4Kids content on iview was viewed via a mobile device 8. Webtrends Data 2014. Play School Entertaining Australian children Since 1966, Australian children have been educated and entertained by the much-loved Play School . Almost 50 years later, Play School still speaks to children and in 2013-14, children's content continued to experience the most rapid growth on new platforms compared with other content. The ABC is developing new ways of interacting with familiar brands. Following the success of the Play School Artmaker App , the Play School PlayTime App was launched in September 2013. The new, time-based app for iOS mobile devices consistently appeared in the top five apps within the iTunes Kids and Education categories, with 299 000 users and more than 16 million total sessions. The application achieved international recognition with Apple's Best of 2013 and two AIMIA Awards for Best of Education\u2014 iPad and Best of iPad\u2014Overall .In 2013-14, ABC3 Online had a monthly average of 605 000 visitors, a decrease of 11% from the 2012-13 average of 678 000. The decline is attributed to the audiences increasingly accessing content via apps on mobile and tablet devices. The top A BC3 programs viewed online include Camp Lakebottom, Dance Academy, a gURL 's World and Life With Boys . Launched in July 2013, RAWR celebrates young media creators by providing a platform and showcase for their work. The site registered over 200 000 views of 'kid made' films and has generated over 20 minutes of content for on-air broadcast. Growth is expected to continue in the next financial year, with a series of themed challenges, partnerships and acti vity drivers. The library of games for older children expanded further in 2013-14 with over 20 game acquisitions. The launch of two landmark games, Peleda and Nowhere Boys , have driven significant traffic to the ABC3 website. The Dance Academy Series 3 website attracted over 350 000 visits and encouraged engagement through UGC activities, fan interaction and social engagement via Facebook. There were over one million views of Dance Academy episodes across ABC3 Watch Now and iview and over 150 000 views of short-form video content in ABC3 Watch Now. 9ABC Radio websites In 2013-14, ABC Radio reached an average of 1.1 million users every month. Local Radio had the highest domestic and international visitors each week (454 000 visitors), followed by triple j (299 000 visitors). The ABC Local Radio network is accompanied by websites covering 53 regions, each of which delivers local news, sport and weather as well as special feature stories that explore the events, people and places that make each region unique. ABC listeners downloaded 71 million podcasts in 2013-14, up from 66 million in 2012-13. Radio National were the top podcast producers with 27.1 million downloads, with the remainder of content derived from local and national radio network programs and news podcasts. Radio player The ABC released a new Radio Player in beta for testing and feedback across a number of ABC Radio sites. After the testing phase, all live and on-demand audio players across ABC Radio will be replaced with a single player that works on mobiles, tablets and PCs. 9. Webtrends Data July 2012 - June 2014.

Fresh Blood is a digital initiative in collaboration with Screen Australia, designed to showcase and discover the best short form comedy creators in the country. From the project launch, the ABC received over 500 sketch comedy submissions which were broadcast exclusively on iview. Within four weeks of airing, Fresh In 2013-14, iview became a testing ground for new television programming strategies and modes of storytelling. All eight episodes of the Chris Lilley series Jonah From Tonga were made available for a 48 hour 'binge' weekend on iview and recorded more than 550 000 plays. The program was later made available as catch-up and recorded two million plays during its online run ('binge' and catch up combined), averaging more than 330 000 plays per episode. 'Whovians' were well catered to on iview, with each of the original Doctor Whos from 1963-1996 shown on the catch-up service leading up to the Doctor Who 50th Anniversary Special in November 2013. The ABC also ran a Facebook competition asking audiences to 'choose their favourite Doctor' and receive a bonus storyline. The BBC supported the competition on its Facebook accounts which increased audience engagemen t. Blood had recorded more than 500 000 plays by the end of June, and spawned enthusiastic conversations on social media between the talent, the audience and the ABC.

White Paper In March, Radio National launched White Paper , a monthly digital magazine designed for tablet devices. It is currently available on iOS, with an Android version in development. The digital publication re-purposes RN radio programs into long-form written features, combined with curated content from the ABC's archives and other content partners. Since the launch, White Paper has covered topics from libertarianism in Australia, health, and the Sydney Writers Festival. The RN website experienced a 40% increase in traffic since the White Paper was introduced, as well as an increase in podcast downloads. 19 White Paper is a six-month pilot project. Location Pilot Project\u2014Spoke The ABC has conducted a long range research project to identify ways in which the ABC can improve its mobile content distribution to current audiences based on location. The project incorporated field research and analysis followed by the development of prototype products and a series of live public trials. Designed for smartphones, and falling under the collective title of Spoke , the live pilots in Newcastle (NSW), Launceston (Tasmania), southeast South Australia and Townsville (Queensland) called for active feedback from the community on the product's relevance as a news and information source. Key findings from the trials informed the development of the ABC's online and mobile strategy for delivery of news. Trials will continue in 2014-15.Social media Social media is being utilised in innovative ways to interact with and build audiences, conduct research and gather feedback, keep abreast of industry trends, and as a new platform for the delivery of ABC content. The vast majority of Australians actively use social media, and almost 75% of those identify as 'dual screeners', consuming television and internet content simultaneously.20 In 2013-14, ABC Facebook accounts, including comments, 'likes' and 'shares', achieved a monthly average of over 140 million impressions. 21 The top ABC Twitter account, ABC News, reached a follower base of 346 200. 22 Top five Facebook accounts by page 'likes' Account Page Likes 1 Bananas in Pyjamas 2 948 000 2 A+ Learn English 1 973 000 3 triple j 770 000 4 ABC News 590 000 5 Ja'mie Private School Girl 564 000 Source: Webtrends, July 2013 - June 2014 Top five Twitter accounts by followers Account Followers 1 ABCNews 346 200 2 triplej 241 700 3 Q&A 162 700 4 ABCNews24 128 500 5 774Melbourne 104 000 Source: Webtrends, July 2013 - June 2014 19.

This development provides universal branding to shortened ABC links, enables improved measurement of social sharing, and indicates that audiences are visiting an official ABC site. In its 21st year, triple j's Hottest 100 countdown attracted almost 1.5 million votes cast by over 170 000 music fans in the popular music poll. On the day of the countdown, the triple j website had 594 000 visitors, with 59% of total visits from a mobile device.24 Social media was a key component of the campaign; Facebook fans grew to 715 000 on Australia Day and there were 345 000 searches on Twitter for #hottest100 hashtag. 25 Listeners registered 5 856 Hottest 100 parties in 87 countries around the world and posted over 21 000 photos of their celebrations on social media. 26 The Chris Lilley television series Jonah from Tonga broke records for ABC Television social media activity. On Twitter, the hashtag #jonahfromtonga was trending in Sydney and Melbourne over the binge weekend, and generated a total 28 000 tweets over the course of the campaign. 27 The Jonah from Tonga Facebook page had 500 000 \"likes\" and a Q&A with Chris Lilley when the final episode aired reached 1.17 million users.28 The social media buzz was reflected in program plays for the binge weekend and subsequent catch-up plays on iview (see page 33). The ABC experimented with Hangouts on Air in 2013-14, a social video tool which enables anyone with a camera and internet enabled device (desktop or mobile) to stream a live discussion or performance to the world via YouTube. The live stream allows up to 10 participants in up to 10 different locations, anywhere in the world. Hangouts on Air offers a light-weight production tool for online broadcast and social media engagement .57 031 contributions to ABC Open The trial was run in conjunction with ABC Guest Host, a cross-platform initiative where ABC personalities guest-curate a section of the ABC Homepage. The objective of each hangout was to give audiences a chance to get to know their favourite personalities in a live video Q&A, with questions submitted on Facebook, Twitter and Google+. Live video interviews with high profile ABC personalities Dr Karl, Todd Sampson, Zan Rowe, Stella Young and Jimmy Giggle were broadcast during trial, which ran for six months.

ABC Open ran over 30 projects and received a total of 57 031 contributions to the website as photos, videos and text; an increase of over 40% on contributions made in 2012-13. ABC Open offered two projects specifically for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Communities and contributors: Me and Mine project celebrating the diversity of Indigenous family relationships; and I am an artist I come from the bush (series two), in which Aboriginal artists share their experience of station life in the Kimberley and its legacy through their artwork. In addition to the website, ABC Open projects are distributed across social networks including Facebook, flickr, YouTube and Twitter, on mobile devices and on ABC Radio and Television and Online. Video stories were broadcast on ABC News 24. Between August 2013 and April 2014, What's Your Story? , a five minute video package featuring content from local producers and contributors, aired before the 7pm News on Friday nights. In 2013-14, all ABC Open content that was broadcast on ABC1 and ABC News 24 was made available on a new dedicated website: https://open.abc.net.au/broadcasts The increase in contributions was assisted by key technical developments on the ABC Open website. ABC Open released a new mobile site in November 2013 and from April 2014, users could directly upload photos and text from a smart phone or tablet, bypassing the need to use third-party platforms and making contributing easier than ever before.Digital education\u2014ABC Splash In December 2011, the Government announced the provision of $19.9 million over three years for the development of a new education portal for students, teachers and parents, to be built in partnership by the ABC and Educational Services Australia. The result was ABC Splash , a content-rich portal which delivers free, high-quality digital education resources matched to the Australian school curriculum. 2013-14 was the first full year of operation for the site and engagement was positive with 4.7 million page views and 1.36 million visits.29 Content on the site falls into two main categories: a media resource library which contains audio-visual material sourced from the ABC's extensive archive and collection and the delivery of several highly interactive, media-rich learning resources that enhance students' learning experiences. Over the course of the year, ABC Splash published an additional 1 147 media clips, 247 small interactives, and three flagship applications to the library, all mapped to the Australian curriculum. Flagship projects delivered in the period included: QED: Cosmo's Casebook , a game which teaches students in years five to nine about daily life in Ancient Rome; Concensus , a data visualisation game which allows students in years five to eight to interact with real data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics; and ABC Zoom , a game that teaches students in years eight to 12 scientific concepts through examining everyday objects at the atomic level. In 2013-14, ABC Splash partnered with the Australian War Memorial, The National Archives of Australia, The Museum of Contemporary Art Australia and The National Portrait Gallery to produce a series 'digibooks' that were published on the education portal. The 'digibooks' present students with a selection of material from the institution's collection which is arranged according to a narrative, to enhance students' understanding of complex topics. ABC Splash ran 10 live webcast events over the reporting period that enabled students to interact with presenters through live moderated chats. The live programs spanned a range of topics and featured astronauts, astrophysicists, journalists, award winning authors and musicians as guests. The resources are accessed predominately during school hours within the school terms, indicating the site is mainly used by teachers and in classroom se ttings. 29.

The ABC provides comprehensive news and current affairs across its television, radio and online and digital services. Australians trust the ABC as an independent source of news and current affairs, with 77% of Australians surveyed believing coverage is fair and balanced.87 In 2013-14, the ABC fundamentally transformed the structures and focus of the News Division to better meet the needs of ABC audiences. This tr ansformation was part of a broader Newsgathering Project, and has included a restructure of existing staff and resources to provide better support for original, multi-platform news content; additional funding from the Federal Government for more original journalism at a national and local level, and improved content for state-based audiences and for younger audiences. In 2013-14, the ABC undertook a project to vertically integrate approximately 400 managers and resources staff into content making areas, including News. Vertical integration will enable the ABC to better allocate and manage resources. The ABC continued to develop initiatives that were introduced in 2013 including the Fact Check Unit, the National Reporting Team, and enhanced regional and suburban coverage. The ABC maintained a strong focus on delivering news that was coordinated across all delivery platforms, breaking more original stories and better serving audiences, and adding to the strength and diversity of the ABC News team. Two significant new projects were developed and implemented: State Editions \u2014The ABC commenced production of State Editions of ABC News Online, developed through collaboration between the News, Radio and Innovation Divisions. Sites were launched in South Australia and Victoria which provide audiences with integrated local, national and international news and information. Digital producers were recruited in each of the eight capital city newsrooms, and the majority have commenced in their roles. An additional team of five supervising producers is working in News Online in Brisbane, Queensland, to provide content for each of the sites, as well as editorial support.

Designed by a group of Canadian academics, and launched in partnership with the ABC, Vote Compass provided a focus on policy issues and a rich source of unique data about Australian views on key election issues. The application drew high levels of traffic to ABC websites throughout the election campaign, and was a strong source of content and discussion across Radio and News programs and platforms. Approximately 1.3 mi llion Australians completed the Vote Compass survey, which made it the most successful use of the application (per head of population) anywhere in the wor ld. Training continued to be a key priority, ensuring continuous improvement in how the ABC gathers and presents news and current affairs. Almost 100 new employees participated in induction programs including: writing for television, radio and online; editorial policies; work health and safety; media law; corporate governance; and specific technical training. A further 389 existing employees attended intensive workshops and responded to a survey focused on identifying training needs. The training initiatives have created a more agile workforce with an improved capacity to report across platforms. The News Division held regular, formal reviews of its individual programs and areas of content involving heads of programming, relevant executive producers and presenters. Separate and independent reviews of the ABC's multiplatform news and current affairs coverage are undertaken each year to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the ABC's content (see page 72).As part of a strategy to revitalise the flagship 7pm News bulletins, the ABC upgraded television studio sets across the country and introduced a more cohesive look across ABC1 and ABC News 24. The ABC sought to enhance its coverage of the Federal Election through the use of Vote Compass, an audience survey tool designed by a group of Canadian academics. The Vote Compass survey was completed by approximately 1.3 million Australians. There were some program changes in 2013-14: a new weekly arts program, The Mix , commenced on ABC News 24; and the weekly program Inside Business ended after 12 years on the ABC. In 2013-14, the ABC continued to deliver original journalism and exclusive stories which had an impact on Australia's political and social life. Each week, the ABC analyses how original and exclusive stories and news angles were broken and developed, the way in which those stories were picked up and shared both by social media and by other mainstream media, and the impact those stories had on the community. This could include prompting debate, leading to official investigations, or precipitating legislative or other change. Content which has had a significant impact during the reporting period included: Extensive coverage of the Federal election across platforms, with the Sydney headquarters of the Corporation being transformed into the ABC Election Centre; The success of the Vote Compass project; The ABC Fact Check Unit, which quickly established itself as an integral part of the national election campaign, with politicians from the major parties responding to and engaging with the determinations; and A series of stories highlighting child abuse in Victoria's residential care system, sparking an inquiry by the Victorian Children's Commissioner. The Asia Pacific News Centre (APNC) is a branch of the News division which contributes news and current affairs content to the ABC's International Media Service. The APNC coordinates news bulletins for Radio Australia and international digital news, news bulletins on Australia Network and contributes content to The World, Pacific Beat and Business Today . The Federal Government's termination of the agreement to fund the Australia Network Service will have a significant impact on the editorial capacity of the Asia Pacific News Centre. The ABC is committed, however, to retaining a specialist international news team in the APNC to deliver accurate, independent news into the region.News and current affairs News and current affairs on radio The ABC distributes news and current affairs content across a range of radio networks and on digital radio. In 2013-14, news and current affairs programs on Local Radio and Radio National had a combined unduplicated reach of 1.9 million people aged 10 and over each week in the five-cit y metropolitan market.88 This was down 0.9% from 2012-13.

Audience share was also up slightly, to 1.6% (1.5% in 2012-13). 89 Coverage of the Australian Federal Election was a key focus of ABC NewsRadio (see page 58). In December 2013, the Evening program, which was coproduced with Radio Australia and broadcast to domestic and international audiences, was decommissioned by Radio Australia. This program was replaced in the ABC NewsRadio schedule in January 2014 with a new Evening program for domestic audiences which retained a focus on the Asia-Pacific region. During the year ABC NewsRadio increased audience engagement on digital and social media platforms through an improved website, the network's first Facebook page and Twitter presence as well as increased on-air promotion of the ABC Radio mobile app .News and current affairs on television In 2013-14 there was audience growth across the ABC's news and current affairs television programming, reflecting its depth, quality and di versity.

ABC News 24's regional 4.4% in 2013-14, steady with 2012-13. 95 The revitalisation of the 7pm News bulletins involved a new approach to presentation of the programs, including more live crosses; greater use of specialist reporters and correspondents; more live interviews; and better use of story-telling graphics. Journalists presented live from the field more often when major stories were unfolding. On ABC1, the combined metropolitan and regional average audience for the Monday to Friday 7pm News in 2013-14 was 1.2 million, a decline of 8% compared to 2012-13. 96 The weekend editions of News increased in 2013-14 compared to 2012-13.

In February 2014, ABC News established the Interactive Storytelling Team, a group of producers and journalists telling stories in a non-traditional way for an ever-growing digital audience. The team was established as part of the third stage of the Newsgathering Project, and their early work demonstrates how interactive content can supplement the high-quality journalism provided by the ABC.

The ABC's International Media Service engages international audiences in multiple languages and builds regional partnerships. The ABC broadcasts to millions of people in the Asia-Pacific region through radio, television and digital services provided by ABC International, supported by news and analysis from the ABC's Asia Pacific News Centre. In July 2013, the ABC implemented its Integrated International Media Service. The service integrated the ABC's international television and radio broadcasting activities Australia Network and Radio Australia and the related digital services. The integrated service enabled the ABC to adopt a targeted approach to growing audience reach, and to deliver on the objectives agreed with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Since the service was implemented in July 2013, the ABC has successfully increased audience reach and engagement across the Asia-Pacific region, and has achieved, or was on track to achieve, the Key Performance Indicators agreed with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Digital services expanded significantly during the year with the development and launch of multilingual market portals for China, Indonesia, India and the Pacific. As part of the digital expansion, ABC International launched Australia Plus , an online and mobile destination for Australian content produced by the ABC. In May 2014, the Federal Government announced the discontinuation of funding for the Australia Network Service. As a result of this significant cut to funding the ABC is working to deliver a remodelled service for local and Australian audiences resident and travelling across the Asia-Pacific region and more broadly, in line with the ABC Charter obligations and within available funding.Audiences Audiences across the region accessed content in a range of ways, largely dictated by the availability of technology. In the developed markets of Asia, television continued to dominate, growing in audience reach and engagement with the rising middle class. The Asia-Pacific region continued to experience high levels of growth in the mobile market; in 2014 the region comprised 3.5 billion of the world's 6.8 billion phone users. 115 The increased use of mobile technology has seen a corresponding increase in the volume of television content consumed on mobile devices. Since implementing the converged strategy in June 2013, audience data tracked to the end of June 2014 indicated the availability of the ABC's services grew by 53%. Television grew 70%; unique visitors online increased 80%; and there was a 730% increase in social media communities (including Facebook, Twitter and Chinese Weibo). 116 While new technology is prevalent in these communities, the ABC is mindful of the significant differences in cultural and socio-economic conditions which exist across target markets. The new converged service has adopted a strategy based on tailoring content and services to the greatest possible degree for the specific markets in which they will be received. In 2013-14, live radio broadcasting in Bahasa (Indonesia) and Mandarin was withdrawn in favour of syndicating select programs on local partner networks. This enabled the Radio Australia service to be refocused for Pacific and Mekong audiences. 115.

Nielsen, Kantar.62 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Audience Experiences 63 Content Reflecting Australian life and views The ABC's International media service aims to deliver content that reflects the diversity of Australian life and broadcast content from across the ABC, as well as from SBS and commercial networks. The efficiencies realised by integrating the operations of the Australia Network and Radio Australia and the associated online services into a converged service have allowed further investment in relevant and original content, developed to cater to diverse audiences through language and genre. Access to digital media, and mobile in particular, has seen rapid growth. Access and engagement with media via mobile devices is now ubiquitous in major markets such as Indonesia, China, South Korea and Japan. In response, ABC International expanded its digital presence significantly in 2013-14 with the launch of marke t-facing portals, multiplatform content, new mobile offerings and a converged social media strategy. ABC International signed a number of co-production agreements with partners in India, China, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea to deliver tailored original content that will be aired on both local and ABC International platforms in target markets. In 2013-14, ABC International continued its successful collaboration with the Shanghai Media Group. In its fourth year, the reciprocal content arrangement 'Window on Australia' saw Australian content broadcast for an hour during prime time for a week on Shanghai Media Group's International Channel Shanghai. ABC International also contributed weekly segments for the Chinese program Cosmo Times which is produced and broadcast by International Channel Shanghai. The weekly magazine program aims to keep \"audiences up with the times of the world's trendiest cosmopolitan cities, including Shanghai, New York, Melbourne and Los Angeles\". In addition, the ABC negotiated an arrangement to establish an online portal in China with a Chinese ISP, providing a unique opportunity to showcase Australia in China (see page 64).In April 2014, ABC International worked with Indonesia's largest media organisation, MNC to produce original content for the 'Australia Month', held in May 2014. Three major television channels in Indonesia broadcast the special series of stories filmed around Australia showcasing society, culture, arts and innovation, including profiles of the Indonesian diaspora in Australia. The event was available to 100 million viewers. A range of popular Australian content was adapted for international distribution, increasing opportunities to engage directly with audiences in the region and promote ABC programs. Popular content like the Play School\u2014Art Marker and Play School\u2014Play Time tablet are now available for audiences in Mandarin. Q&A broadcast special editions of the program from Jakarta, New Delhi, and Shanghai. The popular gaming show, Good Game , was filmed in Tokyo in October 2013.

ABC presenters Phil Kafcaloudes and Caroline Tiriman produced radio and online stories and collaborated on-air with NBC colleagues. Radio Australia's Mornings program was broadcast from Samoa in April 2014, with three days of live content focussing on tourism, food security, issues for small island states, women in business, development, sport and music. The Samoa event helped to launch the Australia Plus Pacific brand and online properties and the Pacific Break music community initiative. As well as increasing awareness of Australia in the region, the ABC's international media service enabled Australians living, working and travelling overseas to keep up-to-date with local issues and events. The ABC delivered a range of news and current affairs and factual programming, with detailed coverage of the Australian Federal Election. Popular domestic programs Four Corners, Foreign Correspondent, Insiders and Dateline from SBS were also broadcast on Australia Network. In July 2013, Australia Network launched #Talkaboutit , a youth oriented current affairs program catering to 18-35 year olds. The program tackled issues from across the Asia-Pacific region with a fresh perspective and approach. AFL and NRL were televised on Australia Network as well as State of Origin games and the One Day International Test Cricket Matches.International services Significant content initiatives from 2013-14 included: Pacific 360: launched in late 2013, Pacific 360 showcases the best of Pacific sports people on Australia Network. The program was based on audience research that demonstrated that sport was a significant area of interest with Pacific audiences; one that can be used as a vehicle for broader conversations around important development issues. Arts: The documentary Ivory, Strings and Bows captured the journey of Chinese musicians, the Amber Quartet, who won the 2013 Asia Pacific Chamber Music Competition in Melbourne. Special coverage of the Asia Pacific Screen Awards in Brisbane was broadcast on Australia Network and syndicated to partners in the region. Pacific Break: ABC International's music project Pacific Break , was relaunched in early 2014. Namila Benson hosted the weekly music program which uncovers emerging musicians across Oceania.

Food and lifestyle: Launched in 2013, Fashion Asia is a weekly show engaging with the region's interest in fashion, highlighting both Australia's interest in the region and its young, multicultural society. Chefs on Tour was produced in partnership with the Victorian Agribusiness Council. The documentary follows a group of Malaysian chefs touring Victoria's rural areas tasting and cooking the local food. English Language Learning: Social media remained an important tool for enhancing audience engagement and a vital platform for content and promotion. Australia Plus social media accounts across key platforms including 'Australia Plus Learn English' , have a community of over two million fans and followers. Business and Finance News: Australia Network increased business programming to provide a mix of business news in addition to specific programs targeting business migrants and telling their stories of success in Australia. Dragon's Footprints explored the stories of six successful Chinese-Australian migrants and was broadcast on Australia Network and through syndication part ners.International Distribution The distribution of the ABC's international broadcasting services is coordinated through a combination of traditional broadcast channels, a growing digital presence and new syndication and co-production partnerships with local media in target markets. Syndication partners, such as Detik.com (Indonesia), MNC TV (Indonesia), Beijing TV and Doordarshan (India) provided new channels for Australian content. Local partners also selected and promoted stories that link back to ABC International services. In 2013-14 the Pacific Beat program was syndicated to partners in the Pacific market, including the National Broadcasting Corporation of Papua New Guinea, Radio Vanuatu, Samoa Quality Broadcasting and Radio Cook Islands. English language learning content is presented daily on Myanmar's national broadcaster Myanmar Radio and Television (MRTV).

It is a self-funding enterprise with 39 staff (including 23 locally-engaged staff) based in Cambodia, Myanmar, Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu and Australia. ABC International Development offers assistance in the form of strategic advice, training and mentoring, technical support and secondments. The core goals of these activities are to support communications for development in partner countries, and increase the demand for better governance. These goals align with the strategic direction of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the principal source of funding for ABC International Development. The work that is undertaken in the region reflects the ABC's strengths in public broadcasting, educational broadcasting, emergency broadcasting, rural/agricultural broadcasting and organisational management and our commitment to regional relationships, as an active member of Asia-Pacific and global media bodies. In 2013-14, International Development continued major programs with Papua New Guinea's National Broadcasting Corporation, three of Cambodia's Provincial Departments of Information, and the Pacific Media Assistance Scheme, which is a long -term program to support the media in 14 Pacific countries.

The Play School concert series also continued touring nationally through metro and regional Australia. An estimated 100 000 people attended the concerts, each of which featured two presenters as well as Big Ted, Little Ted, Humpty and Jemima. Following its success in 2012-13, the second Good Game Live event was held at the EB Games Expo at the Sydney Showgrounds in October 2013. ABC Publishing and Lic ensing Publishing ABC Books publishes in partnership with Harper Collins Publishers Australia. ABC Magazines publishes a range of digital and print titles. During the year, ABC Books continued to commission and acquire titles that aligned with the mix of quality programming on the ABC and the interests of the ABC audience. ABC Books aims to be the publisher of choice for all ABC talent and this was reflected in the publication of books from ABC News' Zoe Daniel, ABC Classic FM's Emma Ayres, ABC Television's Poh Ling Yeow, and ABC Local Radio's Carl Curtain, along with books from other identities who have a profile on or through the ABC, such as Shane Jacobson and Jennifer Stackhouse. The bestselling adult titles in 2013-14 were ABC delicious. Love to Cook by Valli Little, the maritime Australian history Cook by Rob Mundle, Shane Jacobson's memoir The Long Road to Overnight Success, and the third edition of Sarah Edelman's book on cognitive behaviour therapy, Change Your Th inking.68 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Audience Experiences 69 Sales of children's books were led by backlist titles that have sold strongly over months\u2014and in some cases, years\u2014on the market. Top selling titles included Truly Tan by Jen Storer; Play School's much loved Nursery Rhyme Treasury ; the picture book There's a Monster Under My Bed Who Farts from Australian author Tim Miller and illustrator Matt Stanton; and The Enormous Book of Hot Jokes for Kool Kids by Andy Jones, which was first published over 10 years ago. In 2013-14, ABC Magazines published, in both physical and digital formats, the ABC delicious food magazine (11 monthly editions), ABC Gardening Australia (12 monthly editions) and ABC Organic Gardener (six bi-monthly editions). Circulation of ABC delicious and ABC Gardening Australia declined in 2013-14 consistent with the overall decline in the magazine market. The ABC released a range of diaries, calendars and mooks (book-magazine hybrids) across these titles. ABC Magazines released three magazine annuals in 2013-14: triple j (in digital and physical formats); ABC Footy (AFL); and ABC Cricket . In 2014, ABC Magazines also increased the number of editions of each its two key children's titles\u2014 The Octonauts and Giggle and Hoot & Friends magazine\u2014from one issue per year to four.Licensing ABC Licensing creates consumer products derived from ABC programming. Licensing continued to deliver strong sales throughout the year, with Giggle and Hoot merchandise remaining a focus. The core Giggle and Hoot merchandise range\u2014sleepwear, apparel, underwear, plush toys, back to school merchandise, footwear, headwear, hair accessories, and card\u2014was extended to include products such as games, showbags and a new Jimmy Giggle plush toy. The Giggle and Hoot brand continued to be stocked in major retailers including ABC Shop, Target, Big W, Myer and Toys R Us. During the reporting period Licensing launched a range of new products designed for adults, including the Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries Cluedo Board Game, and Miss Fisher and Rake greeting cards, mugs, magnets and notebooks. ABC Licensing entered into a new arrangement with a manufacturer to print T-shirts on-demand for popular ABC brands and characters, including triple j, Rake, Beached Az, Ja'mie Private School Girl and Jonah from Tonga .Consumer experiences ABC Commercial: Gross revenue by ac tivity The ABC generates revenue from a wide range of business activities. Retail 66.6%DVD/Digital Entertainment 13.1%Books 0.4%Program 0.4% Spoken Word 0.5% Licensing 0.9%Video Entertainment and Distribution (VED) Video Entertainment and Distribution acquires and sells video content under the ABC DVD and ABC for Kids labels as physical DVD products in Australia and New Zealand, and through a range of digital and online partners within Australia and internationally. In 2013-14, VED's digital business experienced growth resulting in a significant increase in net profit. A number of key Subscription Video on Demand (SVOD) partnerships for Australia and New Zealand contributed to this success, including partnerships with Quickflix, Telecom NZ, Fetch, Google Play and Dendy Films. DVD and digital distribution activities continued to expand, with 158 new titles released on DVD, six new titles released on Blu-Ray, and 245 new programs uploaded to iTunes. Sales on iTunes Australia grew by 35% in 2013-14, half of which was content distributed under the Commercial's ABC For Kids la bel.Sales and Business Development (SBD) ABC Sales and Business Development manage the sale of ABC produced and acquired content across digital, library sales, footage, audio and stills categories, to broadcasters and other organisations within Australia and internationally. In 2013-14, the Content Sales business was restructured to consolidate all of ABC Commercial's international sales and acquisition activities. The new unit was re-named Sales and Business Development. Sales and Business Development experienced significant growth in content licensing to digital platforms, and particularly to subscription digital platforms. Major sales were secured with Netflix in the United States for the feature documentary Stop at Nothing: The Lance Armstrong Story and for the children's animation title Figaro Pho . Licences were also sold to Hulu in the United States for Figaro Pho and the comedy series, Upper Middle Bogan (re-titled Bess of Both Worlds for international distribution). Sales and Business Development experienced a decline in content sales in 2013-14. This was attributed to a number of long-standing, high-volume cl ients in Asia and the Pacific changing t heir programming strategies and acquiring substantially less content from the ABC than in previous years. In November 2013, the ABC launched a unique \"business to business\" program in conjunction with physiotherapist Anna-Louise Bouvier. Happy Body at Work is a multimedia, digital workplace health and safety education program that is available for license to businesses and workplaces.70 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Inside the ABC 71 Contents:3INSIDE THE ABC Contents: Editorial quality 72 Infrastructure and operations 75 People 7 9 Work health and safety 84 Corporate services 88 The ABC engages Australian children like Felix in educational and entertaining content, and provides it on the devices they are using. From content delivery to training and development, the ABC is investing in the people and infrastructure necessary to meet its Charter obligations. The ABC is constantly looking for innovative ways to make and deliver content for all Australians. By fostering a culture of innovation, the ABC can be agile and adapt new technologies to provide ABC services to audiences when they want on the platform and device they choose. Nine-year-old Felix, Sydney, NSW.72 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Inside the ABC 73 Editorial quality The ABC Editorial Policies are the principles and standards which are applied across the Corporation to maintain high-quality output and performance. ABC Editorial Policies The ABC Editorial Policies and associated guidance outline the principles and set the standards that govern ABC content and are a day-to-day reference for content makers. They are critical to the ABC's ability to meet its statutory obligations and the expectations of audiences. They also form the basis of the ABC Code of Practice , which the ABC provides to the industry regulator, the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA). In addition, they give practical shape to statutory obligations in the ABC Act , in particular the obligations to: provide services of a high standard; maintain independence and integrity; and ensure that the gathering and presentation of news and information is accurate and impartial according to the recognised standards of objective j ournalism. Management of editorial m atters The ABC Editorial Policies and processes are overseen by the Head of Editorial Policy. The Head of Editorial Policy is a newly created position, reporting directly to the Managing Director. It was created in 2013 following the abolition of two former roles\u2014the Director of Editorial Policies and the Manager of Editorial Quality Training\u2014as part of a broader restructure of the management of ABC Editorial P olicies . As well as providing advice and overseeing the continuous development and revision of editorial standards and guidance, the Head of Editorial Policy provides training to staff and content teams around the country, provides advice as required to the Managing Director, and reports to the ABC Board. The Editorial Policy Group, chaired by the Head of Editorial Policy, brings together editorial policy specialists and other senior staff from content -ma king divisions, Legal, and Audience and Consumer Affairs. It is responsible for providing advice to the Corporation in relation to the interpretation and application of the ABC Editorial Policies , and the ongoing review and revision of those policies. On a day to day basis, editorial advice is provided by editorial policy specialists within each content-making division, following the longstanding procedure for upward referral. Review of editorial performance, principles and s tandards Editorial Reviews In December 2013, ABC Chairman James Spigelman announced the introduction of regular, independent editorial reviews as part of the Board's responsibility to monitor the quality and integrity of ABC content. The reviews are consistent with the ABC's commitment to transparently, regularly assessing its output, and identifying ways to improve. Editorial Reviews involve an assessment of selected ABC content by an independent external reviewer. The content is assessed against a range of criteria, including different aspects of the ABC Editorial Policies and other yardsticks of quality. The subject of each review and the choice of reviewer are considered by the Board and approved by the ABC Chairman. In 2013-14, two Editorial Reviews were completed. At 30 June 2014, two Editorial Reviews were in progress. Editorial Review One\u2014ABC Radio Interviews with the Prime Minister and Leader of the Opposition during the 2013 Federal Election Campaign Andrea Wills, formerly of the BBC and the ABC, conducted a review of radio interviews with the Prime Minister and the Opposition Leader in the lead up to the 2013 Federal Election. The reviewer found that the ABC achieved impartiality across the sample of items reviewed, but made suggestions about ways to improve content.Editorial Review Two\u2014Breadth of Opinion and Impartiality in Select TV Current Affairs Coverage of the Asylum Seeker Issue Gerald Stone, veteran current affairs producer and former SBS Board member, conducted a review of selected coverage of asylum seeker issues on 7.30 and Lateline . The review identified four items (out of 97 separate pieces of content) that raised editorial concerns. As a result of those concerns, recommendations for improvement were made. The recommendations led to the revision of the Impartiality Guidance Note, and to the rollout of staff training and other measures. Editorial Reviews One and Two are available at http:// about.abc.net.au/reports-publications/ Editorial guidance In 2013-14, the ABC made two revisions to the ABC Editorial Policies (one of which also involved a revision to the ABC Code of Practice ), and issued a number of new and revised editorial Guidance Notes. Section 11 of the ABC Editorial Policies (Advertising and Sponsorship restrictions) was amended to extend the general ban on advertising to the ABC's digital media services. This change was made following the amendment of the ABC's enabling legislation in March 2013 to include a specific reference to the provision of digital media services. 119 The Television Program Classification Associated Standards are part of the ABC Editorial Policies (and the ABC Code of Practice ). They were amended in 2013-14 to reflect the move of children's p rogramming from ABC1 to ABC3. New Guidance Notes covering the following topics were issued: Advertising and Sponsorship for ABC Commercial Chequebook Journalism/Paying for Interviews Competitions and Prizes Operating Official Social Media Accounts Removing Online Content. Revisions were also made to Guidance Notes relating to: impartiality; moderation; and managing external funding in broadcast television. The ABC Code of Practice is set out in Appendix 5 (page 205). The ABC Editorial Policies and Guidance Notes are available at http://about.abc.net.au/how-the-abc- is-run/what-guides-us/our-editorial-policies/Corrections and clarifications In 2013-14, as part of the ABC's commitment to upholding editorial standards, the ABC expanded its existing Corrections page on its website to deliver a broader Corrections and Clarifications page. The page brings together in one place the corrections and clarifications made to ABC content across radio, television and digital platforms, whether as a result of complaints or for any other reason. Where possible, links to the original content are provided. Since the launch of the page in March 2014, 31 corrections or clarifications have been posted to the page. Entries ranged from correction of minor factual errors to correction or clarification of programs which had attracted significant public interest or concern. In 2013-14, two programs attracted some interest about the ABC's compliance with its editorial s tandards: In September 2013, The Hamster Decides broadcast a skit which referred to Mr Chris Kenny, a journalist and columnist for The Australian newspaper. The Managing Director issued an apology to Mr Kenny. The Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) investigated the matter and found a breach of the ABC Code of Practice (see page 117). In October 2013, Catalyst broadcast \"The Heart of the Matter\", a two-part program dealing with statins, cholesterol and heart disease. Following a number of complaints, the ABC's independent Audience and Consumer Affairs Unit investigated the programs. While acknowledging the importance of public health issues relating to the efficacy of heart disease treatment and the contrasting opinions of highly-qualified scientists, the Audience and Consumer Affairs unit concluded that some parts of the program breached ABC standards on impartiality. Accordingly, the programs were removed from the ABC website. The investigation report is publicly available on the ABC's website: http://about.abc.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Catalyst-Heart-of-the-Matter-ACA-Investigation-Report.pdf In 2013-14, there was considerable discussion and public debate about the ABC's coverage of important news stories, including asylum seeker issues and the Australian Government's program of spying on Indonesian government officials. 119. ABC Act, s.6(1)(ba); s.31(4)-(8).74 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Inside the ABC 75 Editorial quality In relation to one specific story dealing with allegations by asylum-seekers that they were mistreated by Australian navy personnel, the ABC stood by its reporting of the allegations but acknowledged that the stories could have been better expressed. In relation to the allegations of Australian spying on senior Indonesian political figures, the ABC stood by the story and the importance of covering the issue. The ABC takes its editorial standards very seriously and will always carefully examine any concerns or complaints and correct or apologise where necessary. The ABC also has an obligation to report on significant public issues which can sometimes challenge, upset or offend. The ABC does not shrink from that obligation. Election coverage review Whenever a Federal, State or Territory election is called, the ABC convenes an Election Coverage Re view Committee (ECRC) to monitor the ABC's coverage to ensure compliance with editorial standards. The ECRC is made up of representatives from the relevant content divisions, as well as legal and editorial policy advisors, marketing and audience staff and complaints handlers. The Committee is chaired by the Head of Editorial Policy. The ECRC was convened for the Federal Election which was held in September 2013. 120 The ABC commissioned external share-of-voice data which indicated broad and balanced coverage of the major and minor parties. Across the campaign, the external share-of-voice count measured: 40% to the Labor Party; 39.4% to the Coalition; 8.1% to the Greens; and the remainder spread across a range of smaller parties and independents. The ECRC Chair also administers the ABC's allocation of free broadcast time to political parties during election campaigns. Under this arrangement, the ABC makes allocations of free broadcast time on ABC Radio and Television during Federal, State and Territory election campaigns for party political purposes. Over the course of the election campaign, 979 written complaints were received, 32% fewer than for the 2010 Federal Election. Of the complaints received, 51% involved allegations of bias. Of those, 48% alleged that the ABC favoured the Labor Government in its coverage, while 42% alleged the ABC favoured the Coalition (see page 116). In 2013-14, two State Elections were held simultaneously in South Australia and Tasmania. Two separate ECRCs were established which met weekly throughout the campaigns. In both cases, the external share-of-voice data commissioned by the ABC demonstrated a balance of coverage across the campaigns and only a small the number of complaints were received across the election period (15 complaints in Tasmania and eight in South Australia). 120. The 2013 Federal ECRC was convened prior to the appointment of the Head of Editorial Policy, and was chaired by the Director, Legal and Business Affairs. Infrastructure and operations The Operations Group provides and maintains many of the critical resources needed to ensure the effective and efficient operation of the ABC's core busi ness. Technology In 2013-14, work continued on the ABC-wide Information, Communication and Technology (ICT) Roadmap, focussing on enterprise technology architecture that will enable and support the achievement of the ABC's strategic goals and guide future capital investment. Work commenced in 2013-14 on an Integrated Media System (IMS) to replace three core broadcast systems used by over 60% of ABC employees for scripting and production of news, radio production and broadcasting and video production. The IMS project is a key technology project, designed to improve content sharing capability and streamline workflow and end-to-end processes. During 2013-14, the ABC increased its use of cloud computing services in order to streamline future infrastructure requirements This will include transitioning to cloud-based file sharing and exploring how other cloud -bas ed tools can further enhance digital collaboration across the corporation. The ABC completed the implementation of the Television Content Central Ingest system, providing a critical building block in the transition from tape to digital workflows. The system centrally stores live studio recordings and \"recorded\" material which can be accessed across the network for viewing, and transferred into editing applications for production. The existing ICT environment continued to be supported, maintained and refreshed while new technology solutions and opportunities were pursued. The ABC has made a significant investment in upgrading the local network capacity in each capital city to ensure that there is sufficient capacity to meet business demand. Network capacity in regional offices has also been a focus, as more output is being generated in regional locations. Transmission and distribution of ABC services The last analog television transmission services were decommissioned in December 2013, marking the completion of the analog television switch -off . At 30 June 2014, the ABC's digital network reached 98.62% of Australians from 421 transmitters (see page 77). On 18 November 2013, the ABC entered into an agreement with Broadcast Australia to assume control of ten self-help digital television services. These services had been established by local councils or community groups where ABC digital television coverage deficiencies existed. Subject to the approval of the licence holder, the ABC assumed control of the services and became responsible for their operation and maintenance. On 16 January 2014, the ABC entered into an agreement with Broadcast Australia to establish a new digital television service for Sunshine Coast South, providing local viewers with ABC coverage that is equivalent to that of commercial broadcasters. In conjunction with Broadcast Australia, the ABC completed the national rollout of ABC NewsRadio transmitters to regional centres with populations in excess of 10 000. Over 70 new transmitters have been constructed since the project commenced in 2007, making ABC NewsRadio the third largest national radio network in population reach and transmitter numbers after Local Radio and Radio National.76 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Inside the ABC 77 Infrastructure and operations ABC Distribution and Transmission Network Performance ABC ServiceNo. of Transmitters (See Note 1)Broadcast Australia Transmission Network (See Note 2)Total Network Availability (See Note 3)Total \"On-Air\" Availability Target %2013-14 99.92 Number of Transmitters: The number of transmitters includes both analog and digital television and radio. If a transmitter was operational during the period for one or more days it is included within the report. The analog radio by State and Territory numbers exclude the NewsRadio extension transmission services reported separately above. 2. Broadcast Australia Transmission Network (ABC Transmission Provider): The transmission network performance is reported by Broadcast Australia as a contracted deliverable and is measured against the Service Level Agreement (SLA) for each service, network or sub national network. The data is regularly reviewed and authenticated by the ABC as detailed in contract management plans. 3. Total Network Availability: The table shows the impact of all outages on the overall network. This reflects all faults across the transmission networks regardless of severity or cause or whether subject to an SLA or not. The vast majority of these faults are services not meeting full specification such as lower transmission power as agreed by the ABC on a case by case basis.4. Total \"On-Air\" Availability: The figures show \"off-air\" occurrences where no service was provided due to faults and/or maintenance activity. The majority of maintenance activity is undertaken at night so as to lessen the impact on audiences. General Comments: During the reporting period analog television transmission services ceased in Australia with the final ABC Television analog service switching off in Melbourne on 10 December 2013. As a result of ongoing compliance checks conducted by the ABC in 2013-14, minor adjustments have been made to the reported 2012-13 data provided by Broadcast Australia to ensure accuracy. of Australians r eached by the ABC's digital television network98.62 % Digital Television switch off On 10 December 2013, the last of the analog television services were switched off, marking the end of 57 years of analog television broadcasting in Australia. In line with the closure of the analog terrestrial transmission network, the Remote Area Satellite Broadcasting Service (RABS) ended at midnight on New Year's Eve 2013. This service provided ABC1 television and several ABC Radio services to rural and remote Australian audiences beyond the terrestrial transmission network and in reception black spots. It was replaced by the Viewer Access Satellite Television (VAST) service which broadcasts the majority of the ABC's digital television and a number of radio services. VAST is also the primary method of delivering ABC radio content to regional radio transmitters across Australia. At June 2014, there were approximately 220 000 households using the VAST service to access ABC television and radio services. The analog television switch off is part of the Digital Dividend process to release radio frequency spectrum. In 2013-14, 53 ABC television transmitters were re -tuned or replaced on the spectrum, the final stage in realising the Digital Dividend.

The 2013 Federal Election was a broadcast highlight for 2013 (see page 58). During the year, the ABC produced a number of milestone outside broadcasts: the triple j One Night Stand in Mildura, Victoria; Q&A programs around Australia as well as in Indonesia, India and China; the Royal Visit of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge; the international search for MH370; and the single biggest broadcasting event of the year, ANZAC Day. Emergency broadcasting services were provided during devastating bushfires in the outer western regions of Sydney in October 2013 and during Cyclone Ita in Queensland in April 2014. The ABC's extensive archives were utilised in support of a range of ABC activities. This included Big Name No Blanket , Keating and When the Beatles Drove us Wild on Television and Background Briefing and Rear Vision on Radio. There were continued improvements in the delivery of television and radio services across Broadcast Operations and MediaHub. Continued television service improvements saw on-air faults fall for the third consecutive year, from 263 in 2012-13 to 257 in 2013-14. Faults-per-hour of broadcast were lower than at any time recorded in the ABC's television history. In 2013-14, there was a total of 183 fault-free days across all television services (186 in 2012-13). Total radio faults (all networks and local services) fell in 2013-14 to 994 incidents (from 1 190 in 2012-13).Available labour and facilities spare capacity was sold to the market, generating a net return of $300 000 (a decrease of $1.35 million from 2012-13). The reduction in revenue was the direct result of significantly reduced market demand. In addition, a high level of ABC television production activity in NSW impacted potential sales revenue, as facilities were largely unavailable for external hire. Capital works In 2013-14, the ABC commenced construction of the ABC's new Melbourne premises in Southbank. In March 2014, the project received local planning approvals from the Victorian State Government and Melbourne City Council, and progressed to the initial stages of demolition and construction. The Southbank facility will accommodate staff and facilities currently located at three sites across the city in a design that integrates the new building with the existing premises to create a single, contemporary workspace. Co-location of the ABC's operations in Melbourne will further encourage engagement with audiences in the city; enable content creation, re-use and delivery; streamline processes and workflows; and facilitate improved flexibility by providing integrated and sustainable systems to keep the ABC on-air and online. Sustainability is a key consideration for the project, which is targeting a Green Star rating for the office design and a 4.5 star energy rating for the base building (see page 103).People The ABC is a diverse organisation with staff working across Australia and the world. The success of the Corporation is built on the commitment, creativity and skills of its people. In 2013-14, the ABC employed 5 444 people across every State and Territory, equivalent to 4 679 full time employees. The majority of staff were content makers. In 2013-14, the ABC's People and Learning Division was restructured. Services were grouped differently to better align with the ABC's strategic priorities, with a focus on advising and providing solutions and support to employees and managers. Business Partners are teamed with the business to support the delivery of key content priorities and corporate projects by providing advice and support about change management, employee relations and training. As part of the restructure, the division was renamed ABC People. For the third year running, the ABC was recognised as Australia's most attractive employer at the annual Randstad awards, which measures employer attractiveness. ABC values and workplace be haviour The ABC strives to foster a values-based culture, incorporating its values\u2014Integrity, Respect, Collegiality and Innovation\u2014into all aspects of its organisational behaviour. The ABC Values, and Values-based behaviour, are embedded in the Performance Management system for all ABC Executives. The Executive Behavioural Framework is a values-based capability framework linked to how Executives achieve their performance objectives. The inclusion of the Framework provides an opportunity to measure how the ABC Values are translated into appropriate behaviours and enables feedback to be given on the way Executives demonstrate the values in action. In 2013-14, the ABC's Bullying, Harassment and Other Workplace Behaviours Policy was reviewed following amendments to the Fair Work Act 2009 regarding bullying, which came into effect on 1 January 2014. Information sessions on the legislative changes and the policy were delivered to managers and Work Health and Safety Committees and will continue to be provided in the next financial year. Different areas across the ABC, including the Operations Group actively promoted and recognised values-based behaviour with recognition programs and awards for employees who best exemplified ABC Values in action. ABC employees: Full-time equivalent \"Full-time equivalent\" positions account for all employees, including those who work part-time or have other flexible working arrangements. 2004-052005-062006-072007-082008-092009-102010-112011-122012-132013-144 679 4 664 4 603 4 599 4 557 4 535 4 499 4 461 4 345 4 298The ABC employed the f 4ull-ti m 67e equiv 9alent of people 80 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Inside the ABC 81 People ABC Memorial Project In July 2013, the ABC Board and Managing Director commissioned the Staff Memorial project to acknowledge the men and women from across the ABC's history that lost their lives in service of the story, the ABC and the Australian people. The ABC consulted with friends and relatives to craft biographies that feature on a dedicated website. Commemorative plaques were installed and dedication events were held in August 2013 to coincide with the second anniversary of the Lake Eyre helicopter crash. Events were held in all capital cities, with staff, family members and friends in attendance. ABC Designer Daniel Mee developed the flame design which adorns the plaques by turning the ABC logo on its side. He used the blank spaces within the logo to create an image that invokes what is both missing but still an important part of the ABC. For more information visit http://www.abc.net.au/corp/memorialTraining and development The ABC provided a range of training and development opportunities focused on both strategic and operational priorities. Training and development was provided via classroom-based courses and seminars, on-the-job projects, coaching sessions, and remotely using webinars and eLearning packages. Formal structured training was offered across a range of skill areas including digital skills, editorial quality, leadership and management, technical operations, cross-media production, and health and safety. In 2013-14, the ABC prioritised the design and delivery of development programs that supported major change initiatives, such as the ABC Newsgathering Project (see page 54). The Regional Training Initiative continued in 2013-14 after a successful pilot program in 2012-13. News and radio staff from seven regional stations across the country participated in the four day program, designed to strengthen regional, cross -di visional teams to develop content-gathering and multiplatform skills. A breakdown of training provided in 2013-14 by category, duration and participation is available at http://about.abc.net.au/how-the-abc-is-run/ what-guides-us/corporate-responsibility/ Total Training Hours Over 53 000 hours of structured training were delivered in 2013-14, supported by less formal development activities such as eLearning, mentoring programs, scholarships and master-classes.

Employees also accessed more informal programs such as 'just in time' learning aids, on the job coaching and mentoring to support their development. Technologies training Digital skills training encompassed training on a range of topics including broadcast technologies, multi -platform production and video journalism. This training enabled staff to keep up-to-date with technological changes and to incorporate new tools and platforms into their work. Over 189 training events were delivered to more than 1 000 staff in this category, with courses ranging from satellite uplinks training to social media. Editorial training Editorial training remained a priority across the Corporation in 2013-14. The Editorial Leadership course ran for the second year in 2013-14 and was attended by 35 editorial decision makers from across the country. The program focused on strengthening editorial leadership at the ABC to support the consistent application of high editorial standards. The Rad io division ran two dedicated Editorial policies months, supported by regular panel discussions with managers and editorial leaders via webinar. Editorial training was also delivered to content makers across News, Television and Innovation via webinar, conference presentations, classroom sessions and online.

At 30 June 2014, 1.98% of ABC staff were Indigenous, just short of the 2% target set in the Reconciliation Action Plan 2013-15 (RAP) . This increase is due to new approaches to recruitment and employment marketing; a renewed careers website; working closely with ABC managers to create more targeted positions; and extending the ABC's reach into Indigenous communities. Future plans include working with Indigenous employees on career planning, learning and development and strategies for staff retention.

Diversity The ABC is required by the Equal Employment Opportunity (Commonwealth Authorities) Act 1987 (the EEO Act) to develop a program designed to eliminate discrimination and promote equal opportunity for women, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People, people form a non-English speaking background, and people with disabilities. The ABC's Equity and Diversity Plan 2012-15 sets out the strategies the Corporation will pursue to achieve its objectives relating to equity and diversity. The Equity and Diversity Plan 2012-15 is based on three key themes: Being Inclusive Being Audience Focused Being Audience Accessible.The ABC is required by s.9(2) of the EEO Act to report its performance annually for the period 1 September to 31 August. The ABC's Equity and Diversity Annual Report is submitted to the Minister for Communications and tabled in parliament. Current and historical Equity and Diversity Annual Reports are available on the ABC's website: http://about.abc.net.au/how-the-abc-is-run/reports-and-publications/ In 2013-14, the implementation of the Equity and Diversity Plan objectives and strategies across the Corporation has been supported by active Divisional leadership and increased participation by dedicated local diversity groups. Specific efforts were directed to the key area of Indigenous recruitment and retention, and increasing the focus on cultural diversity content and employment. One of the major initiatives for increasing cultural diversity was the introduction of an online tool for content makers and policy makers that provides a range of resources to support services and a workforce that reflects the broader Australian comm unity. Industrial instruments The ABC Enterprise Agreement 2013-16 was certified by the Fair Work Commission on 29 October 2013. The finalisation of the Agreement was the result of consultation and negotiation with the Community and Public Sector Union (CPSU) and Media Entertainment Arts Alliance (MEAA) (as bargaining representative for employees). The Agreement sets the terms and conditions of employment for approximately 4 000 employees, who are classified as Content Makers, Technologists or Admin/Professionals. It aims to strike a balance between providing fair working conditions and achieving a sustainable and affordable cost-base for the future. The new Agreement includes: changes to the amount paid and eligibility for meal allowances to reduce expenditure on meal allowances; the introduction of NAIDOC leave for Indigenous staff as part of the ABC's commitment to enhancing the understanding of Indigenous heritage and culture; and the introduction of two weeks paid leave for supporting partners following the birth of a child.

The WHS Management Framework will be finalised and implemented in 20 14-15. Health and Safety Induction In February 2014, the ABC introduced an online induction module for new employees. The module incorporates WHS responsibilities, and information about the ABC's Discrimination, Bullying and other Workplace Behaviours Policy . The induction is accessible via the internet to enable new starters to familiarise themselves with WHS responsibilities and ABC policies before they commence their employment. This induction replaced the former Day One OHS and Workplace Behaviours Induction and the ABC Online Induction programs. In 2013-14, there was a 96% compliance rate with WHS induction requirements (compared with 88% in 2012-13).121 Work-related incidents ABC Worksafe is the ABC's database for recording all WHS incidents, including those involving visitors, contractors and ABC employees. In 2013-14, a total of 271 incidents were reported in ABC Worksafe. Of the 271 incidents reported, 243 were categorised as \"work-related\" (compared with 237 in 2012-13). 122 Of the 243 work-related incidents reported in 2013-14, 10 were notifiable incidents and Comcare was notified accordingly. 123 An incident is notifiable to Comcare if it results in death, medical treatment as an inpatient in a hospital, immediate treatment for a serious injury, infection with a prescribed illness, or if it involves a dangerous occurrence. The ABC must ensure that notification is made to Comcare immediately after becoming aware that a notifiable incident has occurred.Incident SeverityWork Related Incidents% of total No treatment required/ no injury 45 19 Near hit incident/ no treatment required 44 18 Dangerous occurrence 5 2 First aid treatment only 66 27 Personal injury/illness\u2014 Off work for one day or less 54 22 Serious personal injury/illness\u2014 Off work for two days or more 26 11 Medical treatment as an inpatient in a hospital 3 1 Fatality - - Total 243 100 2013-14 work related incidentsWork related incidents signed off% Signed off ABC Commercial 20 16 80% ABC International 1 0 0% ABC People 1 1 100% ABC Resources 103 90 87% Audience and Marketing 0 - - Business Services 21 18 86% Communication Networks 1 1 100% Corporate Management* 3 3 100% Innovation 1 0 0% Legal and Business Affairs 1 1 100% News 30 21 70% Office of the COO 5 5 100% Radio 29 24 83% Technology 18 18 100% Television 9 9 100% Total 243 207 85% * Including Managing Director's office, Boar d Secretariat, Corporate Affairs, Corporate Strategy and Planning, Editorial Policies, and Audience and Consumer Affairs.

A total of 13 incidents were notified by the ABC. Three were downgraded by Comcare as not notifiable.Work health and safety: Incident severity No treatment required/ no injury 19% Near hit incident/no treatment required 18% Dangerous occurrence 2% First aid treatment only 27%Personal injury/ illness\u2014off work for one day or less 22%Serious personal injury/ illness\u2014off work for two days or more 11%Medical treatment as an inpatient in a hospital 1% 90 % of reported incidents resulted in only 1 day off work or less Once an incident is notified in ABC Worksafe, the nominated manager is responsible for managing the incident, investigating the root causes and contributing factors surrounding the incident, and implementing reasonably practicable WHS risk control measures to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. As at 30 June 2014, these steps had been completed in 85% of the work-related incidents which occurred in 2013-14. 124. A total of 64 claims were accepted in 2013-14, including 25 which related to incidents that occurred in previous reporting periods.Workers' compensation claims Of the 243 work-related incidents reported in 2013-14, 39 resulted in claims for workers' compensation which were accepted by Comcare (compared with 43 in 2012-13).124 Analysis of the workers' compensation claims accepted in 2013-14 shows the majority of injuries (61.5%) continue to be body stressing, which includes all musculo-skeletal disorders such as occupational overuse and manual handling injuries. A decreasing number of falls, trips and slips were reported in 2013-14 resulting in fewer claims for that incident group (compared with 2012-13). The number of mental stress claims has decreased significantly compared with previous years. The costs of mental stress claims are high relative to other claim types and therefore represent a significant percentage of total workers compensation costs for the ABC. The two claims covered in the \"other and unspecified\" mechanism of injury category are vehicle accidents. One of the claims has involved an extended period off work which contributed to the relatively high average costs of claims. Notices and investigations Comcare has the power to conduct an investigation at an ABC workplace at any time to ascertain whether the requirements of WHS legislation are being complied with, regarding a breach or suspected breach, or concerning an incident or dangerous occurrence that occurred. During 2013-14, Comcare conducted one inspection as a result of a Comcare notified incident. In May 2014, an ABC worker fell from a two-metre scaffolding and sustained serious injuries resulting in hospitalisation. Comcare was notified of the incident. The ABC's preliminary investigation report identified the contributing factors to the incident and made recommendations to improve procedures relevant to the activity that was being undertaken when the incident occurred. This included reviewing guidance material for Working at Heights and ensuring all ABC workers were consulted about risks and risk controls. Following an investigation, Comcare advised that they were satisfied the ABC had taken appropriate steps to prevent a re-occurrence of a similar incident. No Prohibition Notices, Provisional Improvement Notices or Non-disturbance Notices were served on the ABC during 2013-14. At 30 June 2014, there were no outstanding actions arising from or relating to previous years. 86 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Inside the ABC 87 Work health and safety Number of claims by mechanism of incident group Mechanism of Incident Major GroupsAverage cost-to-date (2013-14)2013-14* 2012-13* 2011-12* 2010-11* Falls, trips and slips of a person $1 658 6 15 18 19 Hitting objects with a part of the body $3 248 3 3 7 6 Being hit by moving objects $79 2 3 6 5 Sound and pressure $0 - 1 - 1 Body stressing $8 257 24 32 54 49 Heat, electricity and other environmental factors $1 605 1 1 - 1 Chemicals and other substances $0 - 2 - 1 Biological factors $0 - - - - Mental stress $38 709 1 4 3 5 Other and unspecified $9 812 2 3 2 5 All claims $7 127 39 64 90 92 * The data is immature and the ultimate number and cost of accepted claims may dif fer from the data reported as new claims may be lodged in a later period.

Data is accurate as at 30 June 2014. Claim costs are based on estimates as 30 June 2014 Workers' compensation premiums In April 2014, the ABC premium rate for 2013-14 was revised down from 1.63% to 1.48%. This revision was in response to the developments in the lifetime cost estimates for ABC employees who suffered compensable injuries in 2010, 2011 and 2012. The revised rate also reflects the ABC's improved WHS and rehabilitation performance during the premium calculation period. The overall premium rate for all Commonwealth agencies increased to 2.12% for 2014-15 to meet costs associated with the increase in the number of claims for psychological injury and the continuing increase in duration of time off work and medical costs.The ABC was due to receive a bonus of $662 500 resulting from the revision of the 2013-14 premium rate. However, Comcare have imposed a contribution on all agencies to restore the central premium pool to full funding, resulting in the imposition of a $999 923 penalty on the ABC. The ABC workers' compensation premium for 2014-15, incorporating the penalty amount, is $7.9 million (compared with $7.2 million in 2013-14).ABC Workers' Compensation premium rates ABC performance against Australian government agencies combined Premium rates 2014-15 2013-14 1.77% 1.41% 1.20% Health and Safety Committees Health and Safety Committees are established in each State and Territory. Health and safety is also monitored nationally by three committees which focus on specific operational areas: the National ABC Resources WHS Committee; National Radio WHS Committee; and the National Technology WHS Representative Committee. Membership of the State and Territory WHS Committees is in accordance with the current ABC Health and Safety Management Arrangements. WHS performance reports are circulated to the State and Territory WHS Committees to provide greater visibility of overall ABC performance as well as local WHS incidents and activities. 88 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Inside the ABC 89 Corporate services The ABC's corporate functions are performed by specialist groups across a number of Divisions. Corporate Strategy and Planning In June 2014, the ABC established a new Corporate Strategy and Planning Division.

The ABC is committed to conducting its day-to-day activities with integrity, and maintaining the trust of the community. Being responsible is a goal in the ABC Strategic Plan 2014-16 . The Corporate Governance department is responsible for the management and coordination of the ABC's corporate responsibility efforts. Responsibility for implementing and demonstrating corporate social responsibility rests with every employee and manager across the Corporation. A number of senior management positions within the ABC include a reference to corporate responsibility priorities in their roles, including: Head Corporate Governance; Director Business Services; Equity and Diversity Manager; Green @ Work National Coordinator; Work Health and Safety Manager; Manager Risk and Insurance; and the State and Territory Directors. The ABC's Corporate Responsibility Policy reinforces the ABC's commitment to acting ethically and responsibly in all areas of its operations. In 2013-14, the Policy was reviewed and updated. The Policy outlines the ABC's commitment to key principles of corporate social responsibility, which include adhering to relevant laws and regulations, respecting human rights, being accountable and transparent, as well as engaging with both internal and external stakeholder groups. The Corporate Responsibility Group (CRG) met on two occasions in 2013-14. Meetings covered topics related to the ABC's sustainability reporting and measurement of environmental impacts. The group considered how the ABC could address areas of corporate responsibility representing the greatest risk to the corporation and the greatest opportunity for improvement in performance.Reporting performance The ABC reports its corporate responsibility and sustainability performance each financial year in the Annual Report, and on the Corporate Responsibility website: http://about.abc.net.au/how-the-abc-is-run/what-guides-us/corporate-responsibility/The ABC uses the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Guidelines and the associated Media Sector Supplement document to report its performance. 125 The GRI framework provides a common language for organisations to measure and report their sustainability performance so that stakeholders are able to view a more complete picture of the organisation's financial and non-financial activities and performance. The Media Sector Supplement contains guidance on reporting key aspects of sustainability performance that are relevant and meaningful to the media sector. In 2013-14, the ABC commenced a review of the framework for achieving the environmental targets of the Corporation. The outcomes of the review will be used to update the strategies and priorities relevant to reducing the ABC's environmental footprint. Scope and boundary Additional corporate responsibility and sustainability information and a GRI Content Index is available on the ABC's website: http://about.abc.net.au/how-the-abc-is-run/what-guides-us/corporate-responsibility/ Other than references to the activities of ABC International, the report is limited to domestic operations within the direct control of the ABC. Sustainability information about the ABC's investments in MediaHub Australia Pty Limited, Freeview Australia Limited, and National DAB Licence Company Limited are not included in the report.

Each year the ABC reviews and updates the materiality analysis. In 2013-14, the relative importance of each indicator in the materiality analysis was determined according to the extent to which it: contributed to the successful implementation of corporate strategy or reinforced ABC Values; presented an opportunity for the ABC to manage its impacts or affect the priorities of its stakeholders; emerged as important to stakeholders; was recognised as a risk in the corporate risk process; constituted a future challenge for the media and broadcasting sector; was regularly reported by others in the industry; and was recognised by experts or the scientific community as a risk for sustainability.

Article 19 of the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights recognises freedom of expression as a fundamental human right. The ABC's commitment to impartiality and diversity of perspectives reflects the need for a democratic society to deliver diverse sources of reliable information and contending opinions. In pursuing impartiality, the ABC is guided by the f ollowing: a balance that follows the weight of evidence; fair treatment; open-mindedness; and opportunities over time for principal relevant perspectives on matters of contention to be expressed. The ABC seeks to balance the public interest in disclosure of information and freedom of expression, with respect for privacy. Improving access to content a nd services In 2013-14 the ABC continued to take steps to improve the accessibility of its content and services. Improving access for people with a he aring impediment Captioning is the process by which speech or scenes are described in text for viewing on screen. Closed captioning indicates the availability of text that can be activated by users if required. The ABC provides a closed captioning television service on ABC1, ABC2, ABC4Kids, ABC3 and ABC News 24. Over 10 000 hours of first-run programming across all channels was captioned. In prime-time (6 pm - midnight), the ABC exceeds the captioning requirements set out in the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Improved Access to Television Services) Act 2012 . In 2013-14, the ABC captioned more than 90% of prime-time television content on all 98% ABC4Kids; and 95% on Between 6 am and midnight, the ABC captioned 94% of all programs broadcast, short of the 95% target for the year. The shortfall was almost entirely due to n on -ca ptioned music clips within the RAGE program, broadcast late on Friday nights and early on S aturday mornings. In 2013-14, 87% of news content broadcast on ABC News 24 in prime-time was captioned. When it is available, news content includes signing for the hearing impaired. The ABC provided greater access to special events by captioning over 30 hours of ANZAC Day content, including marches and memorial services. This content was live-captioned by a team of 12 stenographers and three captioners, assisted by support staff. The ABC also commenced captioning sport including the Winter Paralympics in Sochi; the West Australian Football League (WAFL), the Victorian Football League (VFL) the Northern Territory Football League (NTFL); and the Shute Shield. Closed captions are available on the ABC's internet television service, iview. In 2013-14, all prime-time ABC1 and ABC2 content, including all news and current affairs, was captioned on iview. The ABC captioned a range of content which premiered on iview prior to broadcast, including Jonah Of Tonga ; Fresh Blood ; and Daters . An increased amount of children's content was captioned on iview, with a focus on ABC3 co-productions. In 2013-14, captioning was available on iview for Bushwhacked, Dance Academy, Nowhere Boys, Good Game SP, and Prank Patrol (Road Trip) . In 2013-14, the ABC received a small number of complaints about its captioning service (see p age 1 16). Improving access for people with a visual impairment The ABC has continued to improve the accessibility of online content and services, and is working towards becoming AA compliant in line with the Federal Government's commitment to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0). The 2013 redesign of the iview website in HTML5 improved accessibility of that site for people with a v isual impairment. Access to ABC Shops and products Shop counters are designed to meet the needs of customers in wheelchairs. ABC Shop design and layouts are approved by local councils prior to opening to ensure they meet the appropriate legislative and regulatory requirements for each lo cation.The ABC has given an undertaking to the Australian Human Rights Commission to always attempt to source products that have closed captions (where the Australian distributor has the authorship rights to allow for this). This requirement has been included in ABC Retail's terms of trade with suppliers. The majority of ABC DVDs (excluding pre-school titles) have closed captions. The availability of closed captioned DVDs is clearly signposted in all ABC Shops and Centres. ABC Retail staff are required to be familiar with the Welcoming Customers with Disabilities handbook, published by the Australian Network on Disability. The ha ndbook includes specific guidelines for assisting customers with disabilities in a retail environment. ABC Shops are referred to in the handbook as being a supportive shopping environment for c ustomers with disabilities. Protecting young or vulnerable audiences The ABC Editorial Policies and associated Guidance Notes contain principles and standards relating to Harm and Offence, Children and Young People and Public Access and Participation. In 2013-14, new Guidance Notes were issued for Harm and Offence, and the television classification standards in the ABC Editorial Policies (and in the ABC Code of Practice ) were adjusted following the move of children's programming from ABC1 to ABC3 (see page 73). All ABC Television content is classified by trained classifiers and appropriate viewer information is supplied with programs that some audience members may find confronting. Content for adults is only broadcast in adult classification time zones. News and current affairs programs include appropriate warnings prior to broadcasting violent or potentially disturbing images or coarse language. News programs observe cultural protocols when dealing with images or stories about Indigenous people who have died. The ABC has created safe destinations for younger television audiences on ABC4Kids and ABC3. Content on these channels is specifically targeted and appropriate for younger audiences. Promotion of content during children's classification time zones is also targeted appropriately. A small number of complaints (nine) were received relating to the suitability of promotions during children's viewing times, and at other times that children may have been viewing. The ABC4Kids and ABC3 websites are also designed as safe destinations for younger audiences, where audience participation is closely monitored and pre-moderated. Participation in online services (such as chat rooms) is limited by tools that restrict the type and extent of content that can be posted on the website, including children's names and photos. Publication of personal and identifying information about schools or sports teams is monitored by trained m oderators. Content for children on ABC Splash is carefully selected and is consistent with the ABC Editorial Policies . All user-generated content and live chats are moderated by an editorial team. All DVDs are classified by the Classification Board and display appropriate warnings or guides. CDs display appropriate warnings related to language and c ontent. The ABC contracts the management of events to third party promoters. The event management agreements require promoters to warrant that each event will be safe and fit for purpose, and will be conducted in accordance with all relevant laws, including those related to work health and safety. The promoters are required to undertake appropriate Working with Children Checks , and to provide evidence to the ABC that the checks have been conducted satisfactorily. Improving digital literacy ABC Open is a unique initiative which, as well as enabling Australians in rural and regional areas to share their stories on ABC platforms, provides opportunities for them to develop digital media skills. In 2013-14, ABC Open producers held more than 2 440 workshops and small group multimedia training sessions, attracting more than 11 200 attendees (see page 36). To facilitate this level of activity, ABC Open has partnered with a diverse range of regional partners, including libraries, museums, historical societies, councils, educational institutions, local clubs and associations, as well as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island groups, art galleries, disability and health services and festivals. The ABC's education portal, ABC Splash, enables the Corporation to share its extensive archive of educational content, and to engage with teachers and students using the digital technologies that are increasingly available in classrooms and homes (see page 36). In 2013-14, the ABC conducted a series of Splash Live events through the education portal ABC Splash. The events involved live, hosted webcasts that were streamed into homes and classrooms around Australia. Students and teachers developed their digital skills through live, moderated chat streams. Participants were able to generate and contribute content as part of the event.98 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Corporate Responsibility 99 Environmental responsibility In 2013-14 the ABC continued to implement a range of initiatives designed to contribute to its environmental sustainability. 126 Energy In 2013-14, the ABC's total energy consumption decreased by 4 711GJ or 2.8% from 2012-13 levels.

Gas consumption is based on 68% actual consumption and 32% forecast consumption. 2012-13 data is actual billed electricity and gas consumpt ion. In 2013-14, the ABC sought to implement a range of initiatives to improve energy consumption. The nature of the ABC business, in particular the reliance on technology, necessarily involves high levels of energy consumption. This is reflected in the energy use figures for New South Wales and in Victoria where there is a significant concentration of the ABC's workforce. The ABC continued to convert fluorescent and halogen lights to energy-efficient light emitting diode (LED) light fittings at sites across the country. The new LED's are estimated to save 20 734kWh per annum, equivalent to a saving of approximately $4 260.Lighting upgrades were undertaken at the following locations: Albany, WA\u2014general office lighting replaced with LEDs (estimated to reduce the electricity consumed by 29%); Canberra, ACT\u2014Exit and corridor lights replaced with LEDs; LED lights installed in fire stairs (estimated to reduce the electricity consumed by 69%); Hobart, Tasmania\u2014field crew garage lights replaced with LEDs (estimated to reduce the electricity consumed by 85%); Launceston, Tasmania\u2014Dichroic lights installed in the radio studio (estimated to reduce the electricity consumed by 42%); Burnie, Tasmania\u2014Office lighting replaced with LEDs (estimated to reduce the electricity consumed by 72%); and East Perth, WA\u2014House and studio lighting was replaced with LEDs (estimated to reduce the electricity consumed by 70%). ABC Retail installed LED lighting at a number of sites and upgraded in-store screens from plasma televisions to liquid crystal display (LCD) screens, which are more energy efficient. Upgrading outdated systems provided an opportunity to explore ways to reduce energy consumption. In Hobart, the office heating and cooling system was upgraded; energy efficient chillers and fans were installed and the electric boiler was replaced with a gas one; all of which are expected to deliver significant electricity savings over the coming years. Solar hot water systems are installed at ten sites: Brisbane and Gold Coast (Queensland), Port Pirie (South Australia), Launceston (Tasmania), Albany and Broome (Western Australia), Canberra (Australian Capital Territory), Alice Springs (Northern Territory), Port Macquarie and Newcastle (New South Wales). The impact of the ABC's solar hot water usage on energy consumption is not measured.95 % Percentage o f paper purchased that contains recycled content1 Tonn 48 es of car4 bon o ffset by ABC trees planted8 Amo76 unt of ra kL inwa ter collected at ABC sites2.8 % Decrease in G reenhouse Gas Emissions The use o f blended E10 fuels is reported in the emissions table (see below).

Total recycled waste was approximately 2 940m3 representing 45.6% of total waste disposed. Approximately 3 512 m3 of waste was sent to landfill. Overall, the proportion of waste recycled, and waste going to landfill, was similar to 2012-13. Waste is made up of secure waste, co-mingled recycling, recycled paper and cardboard, and landfill. Waste disposal data is currently reported for capital city sites only, based on billing information received from the ABC's waste disposal contractors. All capital city sites have co-mingled recycling facilities as well as recycling of batteries, fluorescent tubes and printer cartridges. Mobile phone recycling is in place at all capital city sites and some regional sites. E-waste recycling of old computer hard drives, screens, cables and other technological equipment is available at all capital city sites. In 2013-14, a sustainable catering kit was made available for hire at ABC Ultimo for staff functions. This prevented the purchase of over 2 500 disposable items, contributing to savings in terms of both cost and waste. During refurbishments and rebuilding of offices the ABC endeavours to recycle as much old material as possible. During the refurbishment of the RN offices at Ultimo, New South Wales 92% (29 m\u00b3) of construction waste was recycled rather than sent to landfill. During the building upgrade at Albany, Western Australia, 20% (65 m\u00b3) of materials were recycled rather than sent to landfill.

Materials In 2013-14, the ABC purchased 29 501 reams of paper of which 95% contained over 50% recycled content. The ABC's environmental program Green@Work ran several campaigns to raise awareness about the impact of alternative materials choices (see page 103). The ABC negotiated a new agreement for the provision of mobile phone recycling. The arrangement will deliver better information about the volume of mobile phones recycled.The ABC has taken a number of steps to reduce the use of paper and other resources, for instance: Television Marketing has moved their paper and DVD based publicity guides to an online publicity portal with electronic file delivery. The process for managing production rights information has moved to an electronic file-based system with folder sharing across relevant departments. Work is continuing on file-based pathways for other production areas such as cameras, through to playout and archive. Production areas are working to reduce their reliance on tape-based workflows by migrating to electronic file based systems.Materials consumed 2013-14 2012-13 Copy Paper Volume purchased (reams)* 29 501 30 700 % of total copy paper purchased containing more than 50% recycled content 95% 86% Paper recycled 172 m3139m3 Toner Quantity (units purchased)967 1 180 % recycled material in toner purchased 19% 29% Number of toner and other print consumables disposed of by recycling 1 844 2 062 Volume of toner and other print consumables disposed of by recycling (tonnes) 1.3 1.5 Mobile Phones Volume recycled or diverted from landfill \u00a7 (kilograms) 42.9 39.4 * Based on supplier purchasing reports.

Mandatory environmental standards (ES1 and ES2) of the Federal Government's ICT Sustainability Plan 2010-2015 are applied to all ABC procurements of ICT equipment. All ABC magazines are printed under ISO 14001 Environmental Certification. In addition, the Organic Gardener magazine is printed on Forest Stewardship Certified (FSC) from Mixed Sources paper. All ABC Harper Collins black and white book titles on paper, such as paperbacks and non-pictorial items, are printed on paper manufactured from wood grown in sustainable plantation forests. The fibr e source and manufacturing processes meet recognised international environmental standards and carry certification.Travel and transport The nature of the ABC's operations, in particular its news and current affairs activities, necessitates frequent domestic and international travel. ABC staff travelled a total of 26 412 407km by air in 2013-14, compared to 23 324 606km in 2012-13, a 13% increase. In 2013-14, domestic fleet vehicles travelled 4 227 585km, a decrease of 9.7% from 4 680 534km in 2012-13. Of the 408 vehicles in the fleet: Seven (1.7%) are hybrid vehicles; and 233 (57.1%) have a Green Vehicle Guide (GVG) rating of 10 or more. In 2013-14, the ABC's consumption of fuels directly related to transport was 685 584L, a decrease of 3.3% from 2012-13 (709 049L). Fuel consumption (LPG, E10, Petrol, Diesel and Aviation turbine) is reported at page 99. In 2013-14, 1 484 tonnes of the ABC's fleet related GHG emissions were offset through arrangements with the not-for-profit organisation, Greenfleet. 126 The ABC encourages staff to use sustainable travel methods to get to and from work such as walking, cycling or taking public transport. End-of-trip facilities for staff including secure bike parking, showers and lockers are provided at most capital city and some regional sites. Information about public transport is provided on the ABC intranet. In 2013 the ABC conducted a survey of staff travel in all capital city sites. It provided extensive data on staff commuting habits and led to an increase in the number of bicycle spaces from eight to 24 in Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, and the installation of new lockers in Ultimo, New South Wales. The ABC continues to support and promote National Walk to Work Day and National Ride to Work Day with staff participating at many capital city and some regional sites. 127. Emissions were offset by the planting of 5 539 trees. The num ber of trees planted is a reasonable estimate made by Greenfleet of the number of trees required to be initially planted to sequester the total quantity of carbon purchased and takes into account that not all trees initially planted will survive due to the natural survival rate of trees. Accordingly, trees that do not survive following initial plantation may not necessarily be rep lanted.102 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Corporate Responsibility 103 Environmental responsibility Water consumption In 2013-14, the ABC's water consumption was 74 902 kL, similar to 2012-13.

Not all sites have metered collections.In 2013-14, the ABC collected rainwater from 28 tanks in locations around the country. Metering on the tanks indicated that a total of 876kL of rainwater was collected over the year. Harvested rain water was used for toilet flushing, irrigation and cooling tower supply. Capital works In March 2014, the ABC commenced construction on the Melbourne Accommodation Project in Southbank. The new facility will collocate staff that are currently located across three sites into one integrated facility in Melbourne. The ABC has set a number of environmental targets for the development around energy and water consumption, indoor environment quality, materials and environmental management. The building design and location aims to minimise motor vehicle travel by providing infrastructure for staff and visitors which encourages, walking, cycling and public transport use. The design will maximise natural air-flow and lighting, passive heating and the efficient use of electricity, gas, water as well as water storage tanks and efficient stormwater treatment. In 2013-14, the ABC implemented cloud computing services, to enable large amounts of data to be stored in a way that is energy efficient and will streamline future infrastructure requirements (see page 75). The ABC has been upgrading the local network capacity in each capital city to ensure there is sufficient capacity to meet business demands for the next three to four years, without the need for a major capital investment. Newer technology utilised in this area is increasing capacity significantly without a correspondingly significant energy increase. A further major focus of the past year has been increasing the network capacity for the ABC's regional offices, recognising that there is considerably more output, especially video, being generated from the sites. The ABC's Heritage Strategy was prepared in accordance with s341ZA of the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth) (the EPBC Act). The EPBC Act sets out the ABC's responsibilities to protect and conserve the Commonwealth Heritage values of places which it owns or controls. In 2013-14 the ABC commenced a review of its Heritage Strategy.Green@Work The Green@Work program coordinated various campaigns and events throughout the year to raise awareness amongst staff on how they can lessen their impact on the environment. National 'Switch Off' campaigns over Easter, Christmas and New Year generated awareness about the actions staff can take to be more energy efficient in their working environment. Electricity usage at ABC sites was measured over the duration of the campaigns to show staff the difference their efforts can make in reducing the ABC's electricity use. During 2013-14 the ABC reduced its electricity use by over 4% during each campaign period when compared to the same period in the previous year. Other events were organised to raise environmental awareness and promote sustainability beyond the workplace: The ABC, in partnership with their stationery supplier, held sustainable product expos in most capital city sites during the first half of 2014. This was a chance for ABC departmental buyers to learn about recycled and recyclable alternatives to everyday stationery products and papers. Expos were held in Ultimo, Brisbane, Melbourne, Darwin, Perth and Adelaide. A lunchtime gardening workshop in Ultimo, New South Wales led by Gardening Australia presenter Costa Georgiadis demonstrated to staff how they can grow their own vegetables in containers at home and how to reduce waste. The third annual Green Week in Ultimo, New South Wales was a collaboration between the ABC, University of Technology, Sydney and Ultimo TAFE. A range of events were held to educate and inform staff and students about the environment, including a photo competition, various films, market days and a rooftop garden tour. Staff community gardens in Ultimo (NSW), Adelaide (SA), Perth (WA), Melbourne (Vic), Brisbane (Qld), Canberra (ACT) and Hobart (Tas) provided staff with the opportunity to learn organic gardening techniques.104 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Corporate Responsibility 105 Social responsibility The ABC has a long history of contributing social value to the communities in which it operates. It does this through activities such as emergency broadcasting, Community Service Announcements that support Australian communities, and contributing to the development of media organisations in the Asia-Pacific region. ABC in the Community Community Service Announcements The ABC broadcasts announcements about community issues or events which are in the public interest, subject to the ABC Editorial Policies Standard 9 (Public access and participation). Due to its localisation and immediacy, radio is the primary medium for the ABC to broadcast Community Service Announcements. Examples of Community Service Announcements broadcast in 2013-14 include: Throughout the year Local Radio broadcast a number of Community Service Announcements on how to prepare for and what to do in emergency situation s. In October 2013, ABC Local Radio supported the Great Garage Sale Trail initiative nationally through a range of activity including Community Service Announcements. The initiative aims to encourage people to recycle rather than adding to landfill. In December 2013, Community Service Announcements on Local Radio promoted appeals to raise funds and donations for those who are less advantaged and in need during the festive season. Local Radio worked in conjunction with charities such as: The Samaritans, Foodbank, The Salvation Army, Kids in Care and the Department of Communities.Workplace giving In 2013-14, ABC employees raised $104 627 for charities through the ABC's Workplace Giving program. This represented a 7.9% increase in contributions over 2012-13. In addition, over $50 000 was donated by ABC employees as part of charitable fund-raising events, including the Biggest Morning Tea, Steptember, and the CEO Sleepout. Connecting with communities The ABC provides both community groups and staff with the opportunity to jointly recognise commemorative days which draw attention to environmental, health or other community issues. During 2013-14, regional and capital city offices in each State and Territory took part in a variety of activities related to Harmony Day, Green Week, International Women's Day, National Diabetes Week, Reconciliation Week, National Indigenous Literacy Week, Walk to Work, Ride to Work, and NAIDOC Week. 1233 ABC Newcastle partnered with the Hunter Institute of Mental Health to promote the Living Well Community Forum at Newcastle City Hall on 4 June. The event attracted a capacity crowd of 800. Craig Hamilton, Saturday Breakfast presenter, ABC Grandstand sports commentator and mental health advocate, was a guest speaker and driver of the event. Other speakers included Newcastle Knights' coach, Wayne Bennett and CEO of Hunter Institute of Mental Health, Jaelea Skehan. Emerging from a drive to increase the diversity on the ABC's airwaves, 612 ABC Brisbane ran a pilot Community Correspondent program. The program recruited people through a campaign that was conducted on air, through social media and through local press. The 30 Community Correspondents come from a diverse range of backgrounds, demographics and locations across Brisbane. The youngest Correspondent was nine years old. Profiles of the Community Correspondent are available at http://abc.net.au/local/stories/2014/04/30/3995242.htm?site=brisbane&section=competitionsHumanitarian appeals The ABC works with aid agencies during crises and humanitarian aid appeals when it is appropriate and possible to do so. In 2013-14, the ABC raised awareness for disaster relief in the Syrian Humanitarian Aid appeal, the Asian Typhoon Recovery appeal, and in April 2014 the Solomon Islands Flooding appeal. The ABC's Role as Emergency Broadcaster During times of emergency the ABC provides an important service to communities. Emergency broadcasting Local Radio stations in affected communities broadcast updates, emergency information and warnings as required. Updates were provided on television, social media, streamed online, and through the ABC Emergency website. During the year, the ABC updated its flagship app to include national emergency announcements. Emergency broadcasts in 2013-14 included: In October 2013, Local Radio stations in NSW provided rolling coverage to the communities affected by major fires in the Blue Mountains, Lithgow, Central Coast and Southern Highlands, with online producers rostered to provide social media coverage 24-hours a day as required. In mid-January 2014, 891 ABC Adelaide provided rolling coverage of four major fires at Eden Valley, Ngarkat, Billiatt, Bangor and the Riverland in South Australia over a 72-hour period. ABC North and West provided overnight coverage for two days following a flare up at the Bangor fire. In February 2014, flooding in the Kimberley area of Western Australia and fires in Tasmania required the local stations to drop out of national cricket coverage for up to four hours each to provide continuous warnings and updates. During March and early April 2014, a number of other incidents were monitored with alerts broadcast as required. These included: Tropical Cyclone Gillian which threatened the vulnerable community of Christmas Island. From 21-22 March, the local community radio station switched to ABC North West (Karratha) coverage which provided hourly warnings and interviews. Local Radio in Western Australia and Victoria broadcast a range of alerts, emergency warnings and total fire ban warnings in several regions in their States experiencing fires. On 11 April, ABC Far North (Cairns) provided emergency coverage around Tropical Cyclone Ita which crossed the Queensland coast near Cape Flattery as a category four cyclone. The Standard Emergency Warning Signals (SEWS) were broadcast as required by the Bureau of Meteorology and rolling coverage provided at the height of the emergency. The ABC Extra digital service carried ABC Far North's coverage, also streamed online. The ABC Emergency website published extensive information on what to do 'before, during and after' a cyclone. In February 2014, 774 ABC Melbourne Mornings devoted significant airtime to the mine fire in the Victorian town of Morwell. Issues raised during the broadcast formed key elements of the terms of reference for the inquiry into the fire. ABC Gippsland and 774 ABC Melbourne produced a joint program, live from the Morwell Central Business District that gave locals a forum to raise their concerns. Contributing to community resilience The ABC's expertise in emergency broadcasting means that as well as the national emergency broadcasting coverage provided across its platforms, the ABC contributes to initiatives designed to raise awareness and resilience in times of emergency. The ABC in South Australia met with SA Health to assist with the framing of operational responses to emergency situations, particularly aged care facilities and formulating an emergency response policy. The ABC Local Radio South Australia's Regional Content Director took part in a community resilience exercise conducted by the State Emergency Recovery Committee. All major emergency and government agencies took part in the exercise. The destruction of major infrastructure in a remote township formed the basis of the exercise. In August 2013, the ABC Local Radio Content Manager Tasmania, spoke at the Tasmanian Fire Service charitable Workplace Giving program51.2 % Percentage of AB C workforce that is female106 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Corporate Responsibility 107 Social responsibility In September 2013, ABC Local Radio Queensland staged its first Emergency Week, which drew attention to the importance of preparedness for the storm season and complemented the Get Ready Queensland campaign. The ABC worked with the Brisbane City Council and Emergency Management Queensland (EMQ). In October 2013, ABC Local Radio Tasmania dedicated a day of broadcasting to fire awareness and preparat ion. Helping communities rebuild In 2013-14, the ABC played an active role in the physical and emotional recovery of communities affected by emergencies. The ABC's Local Radio network provided opportunities for communities to discuss and share the impact of an event, and to bring survivors together to support their emotional recovery. For instance: In December 2013, 702 ABC Sydney Mornings presenter Linda Mottram broadcast live from the Bells Line of Road, Lithgow and Mt Victoria region to report on the aftermath in these areas and talk with communities about their experiences and the rebuilding and recovery phase now underway. In December 2013, Local Radio Weekends presenter Simon Marnie broadcast live from Winmalee High School in NSW as part of the Community Recovery Picnic Day. The broadcast included a community cricket match between members of the Springwood Cricket Club, Warrimoo and Valley Heights Rural Fire Service (RFS) volunteers, Australian fast bowler Pat Cummins, Phil Davis and Steve Coniglio from the Greater Western Sydney (GWS) GIANTS Football Club, Mitchell Allgood and Brenden Santi from the Parramatta Eels. An idea suggested by a listener resulted in 702 ABC Sydney raising $29 000 for Blue Mountain bushfire relief. An on-air auction of five canvas prints of a photograph titled The Cricketers : (see below). In May 2014, a Bushfire recovery Outside Broadcast was mounted by Local Radio Western Australia in Kalamunda, following the devastating losses in the Perth Hills in January 2014. A large live audience listened to personal stories, practical information and descriptions about the way the community rallied. 702 ABC Sydney has raised $29 000 for Blue Mountain bushfire relief with yesterday's on air auction of five canvas prints of the poignant image, \"The Cricketers\". The prints were auctioned by presenters in Breakfast , Mornings , Afternoons , Drive and Evenings programs. \"The Cricketers\", taken by ABC Local Radio's John Donegan, shows Warrimoo RFS volunteer fire fighters enjoying a break with some backyard cricket in the Blue Mountains. John spent much of the October emergency in the Blue Mountains, capturing the drama faced by both residents and fire fighters. The Cricketers shows a lighter moment in what were often difficult conditions. Warrimoo RFS enjoy a break from the October bushfires out the back of Norman Lindsay House, Faulconbridge.

Product Responsibility Product information and labelling The ABC ensures all products are appropriately labelled. No changes to policy or practice regulating product information or labelling were made during 20 13-14. Where it is appropriate, packaging displays information about appropriate disposal of packaging. Examples include: \"Warning! Plastic Bag can be dangerous. To avoid danger of suffocation keep this bag away from babies and children please dispose of all packaging responsibly.\" \"Dispose of all packaging ties before giving to your child.\" \"Battery disposal notification symbol.\" ABC licensed merchandise packaging is clearly marked if the packing is a potential hazard. Information on DVD packaging is provided about the nature and classification of the content, including running time; aspect ratio; sound format; region encodi ng; number of discs; and captioning information. Consistent with safety testing procedures for toys (such as AS/NZS ISO 8124), products were appropriately labelled. For instance, products which contain small parts included a \"Not suitable for children under 18 months of age\" warning. Quality assurance All licensees of ABC branded merchandise have contractual obligations to manufacture high quality products that meet Australian Standards applicable to the product. Children's products are Safety Tested to the Standards AS/NZS ISO 8124 parts 1, 2 and 3 if applicable. Products aimed at adults may also be required to be tested to relevant standards. Licensees are required to provide certificates to prove the test results. If there are no applicable Australian Standards or testing procedures for a product aimed at children, the ABC requires that licensees or manufacturers perform tests that conform to American or European testing, to safeguard product safety and quality. Licensees test for colourfastness, shrinkage and flammability of apparel products. These products are required to meet retailer's individual standards.Product complaints and recalls During the reporting period ABC Commercial developed a comprehensive procedure for managing customer complaints regarding ABC branded/licensed product. The procedures set in place guidelines for ABC Commercial to follow in the event of a complaint that may prompt a product recall and establish the broad steps that need to be taken for the product recall to be initiated. Once a product recall has been initiated the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission guidelines are followed. In 2013-14, ABC Retail updated their Policy and Procedures Manual to codify and specify the actions which retail staff must take when a complaint is made regarding a product which may be faulty or have caused harm or injury. There were no product recalls during the reporting period. Protecting Privacy Information about the ABC's compliance with privacy obligations is set out at page 115. Social responsibility in the workplace Values at work The ABC is committed to demonstrating values-based leadership, fostering the attitudes and behaviours that contribute to a safety conscious, creative and vibrant working environment that fosters innovation. In 2013-14 a new online induction module was developed to promote ABC values, work health and safety responsibilities, and the new bullying and workplace behaviours policy. The induction is accessible to all new starters before they join the ABC (see page 84). Specific divisional activities have been utilised to promote ABC values in action. For instance, the Technology division ran team sessions on Creating a Positive Workplace Culture, to explore how the ABC Values and workplace behaviours are embedded in how they do business.108 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Corporate Responsibility 109 Workplace health and safety Information about workplace health and safety management and performance is set out at page 84. Dealing with significant change In 2013-14, the ABC implemented two significant projects which involved fundamental changes to structures and workflows\u2014the Vertical Integration project and the Newsgathering Project. The Vertical Integration project redistributed the centralised pool of production operations resources staff into the News and Television divisions. The Newsgathering Project involved a fundamental transformation of the structures and focus of the News Division to better meet the needs of audiences. The People Division teamed up with partners across the corporation to develop ways to manage change and the impact on employees. Assistance included change and communications planning, targeted training and development initiatives, and organisation design. Consultation with staff and unions was conducted as required. Information about the Vertical Integration and Newsgathering Projects is provided at page 53. Mental health in the workplace In 2013-14 the ABC appointed a new Employee Assistance Provider (EAP) following a public tender process. The EAP provides solution-based counselling sessions for a range of personal and work related issues to ABC staff and their immediate fam ilies. The ABC is aware of the potential risks to the mental health of employees who are involved in the production of news and current affairs, particularly when dealing with stories which are confronting or distressing. Trauma Awareness training was provided in 2013-14 to twelve staff members, including new Cadets. Surviving Hostile Environments training was provided in conjunction with the external company Dynamiq to 15 employees. In August 2013 the ABC hosted a one day forum for journalists on 'Reporting Responsibly on the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse'. The forum was part of an initiative aimed at promoting accurate, ethical and informed coverage of the issues. The forum was funded by the Dart Centre Asia-Pacific and supported by the Mindframe National Media Initiative, the Media Entertainment and Art Alliance, and the ABC. The ABC also offered workshops aimed at building resilience to all staff covering the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. In October 2013, the CEO of Sane Australia, Jack Heath, was invited to share his insights into mindfulness and fostering positive mental health in the workplace. The session was recorded and streamed live for staff who were unable to attend. Diversity in the workplace Whilst the ABC is not governed by the Workplace Gender Equality Act 2012 , the gender equality indicators in that legislation provide a useful benchmark for monitoring gender equality. Additional information about equity and diversity is at page 82. Gender profile The overall proportion of men and women employed is consistent across the ABC, and is relatively evenly balanced. The higher number of women working in the retail group is reflected in the lowest salary ranges.

Flexible working arrangements In 2013-14, flexible working arrangements were available and utilised by staff to support family or caring responsibilities. A total of 241 employees took parental leave in 2013-14, comprising 235 women and six men.Under the ABC's Leave Policy , additional leave may be available to employees to meet particular needs. In addition to entitlements to personal leave and parental leave, employees may apply for Miscellaneous Paid Leave or Leave Without Pay. Section 12 of the ABC Enterprise Agreement 2013-2016 makes specific provision for Individual Flexibility Arrangements to be entered into. Continuous learning and skills development Over 9 000 staff attended over 2 000 training events that were delivered internally, externally, online and via webinar, totalling 54 270 participant hours. In line with industry trends and emerging approaches to learning, there was significant shift from formal classroom based courses to more flexible methods of delivery, as well as an increase in informal training. Examples include: ABC development teams ran a number of 'hackathon' events through the year, where those involved in software development and computer programming collaborate to understand a problem or develop solutions. Events included a detailed analysis of the ABC search data and work on a custom tool to help ABC website owners achieve website best practice. ABC Shops continued to run Accredited Training programs delivered by the Australian Retailers Association Retail Institute in both Certificate IV in Retail Management for Shop Managers and Certificate III in Retail Operations for Shop Assistants. Three Shop Managers and 10 Shop Assistants successfully completed their respective courses in 2013-14. Small, informal workshops were conducted to familiarise ABC Magazines' staff and external magazine publishers with the Guidance Note: Advertising and Sponsorship\u2014 ABC Commercial . The ABC provided a number of internal training opportunities across content and operation areas of the ABC, as well as in Marketing and Technology for Indigenous staff. The ABC partnered with the Australian Film and Television and Radio School (AFTRS) to provide Indigenous staff at the ABC with access to AFTRS short courses. Additional information about training and development is at page 80.Social responsibility Staff volunteers at the Lunar New Year broadcast.

The ABC is accountable to all Australians for the delivery of high-quality media content in an efficient and responsible way. The ABC's strong governance framework ensures it fulfils its formal obligations as a statutory corporation. The ABC recognises its responsibility to the Australian people as a publicly-funded broadcaster, and adopts high standards of corporate governance. By setting meaningful and measurable strategic goals, the ABC can assess its performance and consistently deliver a valued and valuable service to all Australians. The Ten , ABC Open contributor Steven Powell. Secret Harbour, WA. 112 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Governance 113 Corporate governance The ABC Board and management apply a corporate governance framework that aims to balance the ABC's performance as a creative media organisation, on the one hand and its need to comply with the formal obligations of a statutory corporation on the other. Enabling legislation ABC corporate objectives, strategies, policies and activities derive from the requirements of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 (\"ABC Act\"). In particular, s.6 of the Act\u2014the ABC Charter\u2014outlines the functions of the Corporation and s.8 lays out the duties of the Board (see Appendix 1, page 196). The ABC Act expressly provides for both the editorial and administrative independence of the Corporation, thereby investing the Board with considerable discretion. In acknowledgement of that independence, the ABC accepts the obligation to meet the highest standards of public accountability. Governance and management processes Board Governance The roles and responsibilities of the Board are described on page 10. The ABC Board held six meetings during 2013-14.The Audit and Risk Committee met on five occasions and the Finance Committee met on four occasions. The Human Resources Committee did not meet during 2013-14, as all pertinent matters were dealt with by the full Board. Further information about the ABC Board and its Committees is provided in Appendix 2 (see page 197). Management Processes The Managing Director chairs a monthly meeting of the ABC Executive, comprising Divisional Directors and the Heads of specialist support units reporting to him. This group also convenes briefly each Monday mor ning. The Audience Strategy Group, comprising the Managing Director, Chief Operating Officer and Directors of content areas (Radio, News, Television and Innovation) is responsible for coordinating the ABC's cross-divisional content strategy.The ABC's governance framework includes a number of executive and advisory groups which provide guidance and leadership around areas such as digital strategy, risk management, information technology, work health and safety, and policy development. Internal Audit Group Audit provides an independent and objective audit and advisory service which is designed to add value and improve the Corporation's operations. Group Audit helps the ABC to achieve its objectives by bringing a systematic and disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of risk management, control and governance processes. In 2013-14, Group Audit completed scheduled audits which included comprehensive, compliance, information technology and project assurance audits. Group Audit also performed unscheduled reviews at the specific request of management and continued to use technology to undertake continuous auditing and monitoring of transactional data. As in previous years, Group Audit used a combination of in-house staff and external companies to deliver audits and provide the most appropriate industry experience and technical expertise. Group Audit also provided guidance and advice to ABC management and staff on good governance, risk management, controls and policies. As part of the ABC's best practice arrangements, the Head Group Audit met regularly with the Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee during the course of the year in addition to formal Committee meetings. Further information is provided in Appendix 2 (see page 198).Fraud Control In 2013-14, the ABC updated its Fraud Control Plan for 2014-2016 to ensure the Corporation met the requirements of the Commonwealth Fraud Control Guidelines. It promoted awareness of its fraud control measures, including the Confidential Fraud Hotline. The Corporation also participated in the annual ABC Commonwealth Fraud Control Guidelines Annual Reporting Survey, which was administered by the Australian Institute of Criminology. The Managing Director is satisfied that the ABC has prepared fraud risk assessments and fraud control plans, and has in place appropriate procedures and processes relating to fraud prevention, detection, investigation, reporting and data collection, which meet the requirements of the Commonwealth Fraud Control Guidelines. Risk Management The ABC conducts a review of the ABC's Corporate Risk Profile of strategic risks twice annually to ensure they adequately reflect the current operating environment. The review is conducted by the Executive Risk Committee, which comprises representatives from each Division. The outcome of that review is discussed and endorsed by the ABC Executive and the Audit and Risk Committee. Operational risks are identified and reviewed on an ongoing basis, and may be proactive and relate to planning activities, or reactive and relate to incidents that have occurred. The operational risks managed through this ongoing process provide a day-to-day identification and reporting mechanism within divisions. The ABC participated in Comcover's 2014 Risk Management Benchmarking Survey of 135 government agencies, which rated the Corporation's risk management practices as \"Structured\", representing a score of 8.1 out of 10. The ABC continues to maintain strong results when compared to the average maturity level of overall Commonwealth government departments and agencies, and in relation to the ABC's peer group. The ABC is committed to maintaining the stability and resilience of its operations, as well as prioritising the safety and wellbeing of employees during and after any business disruption event. The ABC's Business Continuity Management program independently operates within and supports the Corporation's broader governance, policy and risk management framework to maintain and improve the planning and response activity to adverse events that may impact ABC people, facilities or operations. The Business Continuity Management program aims to continually improve the leadership, process and communications requirements of the ABC emergency coordination, crisis management and business continuity and recovery processes. Understanding and effectively managing these risks through the Business Continuity Management program is part of the ABC's commitment to building organisational resilience. Corporate Strategy Setting Section 31A of the ABC Act requires the Board to develop corporate plans that set out the strategic direction for the ABC. In 2013, the ABC developed a new three-year Strategic Plan for the period 2013-16. The ABC Strategic Plan 2013-16 was approved by the Board and commenced on 1 July 2013. The Strategic Plan 2013-16 continues to focus on the six goals set out in the previous plan, which remain an accurate reflection of the ABC's Values, Charter obligations and strategic direction: Audience-focused High-quality Innovative Values-based Efficient Responsible. The Strategic Plan 2013-16 meets the requirements of s.31B(1) of the ABC Act by setting out the objectives of the Corporation; outlining the overall strategies and policies that the Corporation will follow; including a forecast of the revenue and expenditure of the Corporation and its subsidiaries; and including appropriate performance indicators and targets.114 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Governance 115 Corporate governance Corporate reporting and compliance Compliance Reporting In June 2008, the Department of Finance and Deregulation issued Finance Circular No. 2008/5 relating to Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 (\"CAC Act\") bodies in the general government sector. The Circular requires the ABC Board to report on compliance with the CAC Act, CAC Orders 2011 and CAC Regulations 1997 and the Corporation's financial sustainability to the Minister of Finance and Deregulation and the ABC's responsible Minister by 15 October each year. To meet these requirements, the ABC has established an i nternal compliance reporting framework. The Board signed and submitted the Compliance Report relating to the 2012-13 reporting period before the due date in October 2013. Annual Report The ABC is required by s.9 of the CAC Act to prepare an annual report. The report must be submitted to the responsible minister for presentation to the Parliament. The ABC 2013 Annual Report was submitted to The Honourable Malcolm Turnbull, Minister for Communications and was tabled in Parliament on 18 October 2013. Report against the ABC Strategic Plan The ABC Strategic Plan 2013-16 sets out the strategies which will be pursued in order to achieve the ABC's goals of being Audience Focused, High Quality, Innovative, Values Based, Responsible and Efficient. Assessment of progress is based on ten performance areas, which reflect the key elements of the ABC's strategies. Performance against the ABC Strategic Plan 2013-16 is set out at page 118.Freedom of Information The Freedom of Information Act 1982 (\"FOI Act\") gives the public the right to access documents held by the ABC. During 2013-14, the ABC received 39 requests for access to documents under the FOI Act. Three requests were granted, three were granted in part, 15 were refused, 15 were withdrawn or deemed to be withdrawn, and one was dealt with outside of the formal FOI process. Two requests were still being processed at the end of the financial year. Of the 15 requests which were refused, three were outside the scope of the FOI Act. Part II of Schedule 2 of the FOI Act specifically excludes documents relating to the ABC's program material from the operation of the FOI Act. One matter was the subject of Internal Review. Access to documents was refused on review on the basis that the documents were program material and outside the scope of the FOI Act. In 2013-14, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner finalised eight matters which were the subject of Information Commissioner Review, five of which related to applications made in previous reporting periods. Of the eight matters, the OAIC upheld the ABC's decision in five matters; determined not to undertake a review in two matters in two matters; and closed one matter on the basis that no documents existed. In accordance with s.8(1) of the FOI Act, the ABC has prepared an Agency Plan which describes how the ABC will comply with the Information Publication Scheme requirements set out in Part II of the FOI Act. The ABC's Agency Plan and Disclosure Log are published on the ABC's website: http://about.abc.net.au/how-the-abc-is-run/what-guides-us/freedom-of-information/Privacy In 2013-14, the ABC implemented changes to policies and procedures in response to significant amendments to the Privacy Act 1988 which came into effect on 12 March 2014. Changes included updating the ABC Privacy Policy to reflect the new Australian Privacy Principles and implementing a new internal Information Handling Policy . In November 2013, the ABC became aware of a privacy breach which resulted in the disclosure of personal information concerning approximately 100 ABC employees. An investigation determined that the information had been inadvertently disclosed in October 2012, and portions of that information were subsequently published by a third party to the world at large. Employees affected by the disclosure were notified and steps were taken to contain the breach and guard against similar breaches in future. The ABC notified the Privacy Commissioner of the breach. Audience contact An important avenue for assessing the ABC's performance with its core constituency is through audience feedback, including complaints. Written complaints about issues such as factual inaccuracy, bias or inappropriate content are referred to the ABC's Audience and Consumer Affairs unit. Audience and Consumer Affairs is independent of ABC program areas and can investigate written complaints referring to possible breaches of the ABC Editorial Policies or ABC Code of Practice . The unit also coordinates responses to a range of programming and policy enquiries. The Reception Advice Line is the first point of contact for viewers and listeners experiencing technical problems receiving ABC television or radio. A summary of audience contacts to the Reception Advice Line is set out at page 124. In 2013-14, Audience and Consumer Affairs logged 52 287 audience contacts, a 10.8% increase on the 47 205 contacts logged by Audience and Consumer Affairs in 2012-13.The profile of contacts reported by Audience and Consumer Affairs reflects the particular remit of the unit. Written complaints alleging a breach of the ABC Code of Practice or ABC Editorial Policies received elsewhere in the ABC are required to be referred to Audience and Consumer Affairs in the first instance, whereas requests, suggestions, praise and other comments are not. This, and the unit's specialist complaints-handling focus, means that the proportion of contacts received by Audience and Consumer Affairs which are complaints will generally be higher than the proportion received elsewhere throughout the Corporation. Summary of Contacts Received Contact type Email/Letter/Other Number % Complaint 26 484 50.6 Request/Suggestion 19 607 37.5 Appreciation 4 112 7.9 Other 2 084 4.0 Total 52 287 100.0 Subject Matter of Contacts Received SubjectEmail/ Letter/Other% Total Requests for information, programs, product availability and other matters 21 69 1 41.5 Complaints about program standards, scheduling and other matters 19 385 37.1 Appreciation of programs and presenters 4 112 7.9 Party political bias 2 812 5.4 Bias (other than party political)* 2 038 3.9 Complaints of factual inaccuracy 1 439 2.7 Lack of balance 810 1.5 Total 52 287 100.0 * Includes claims of bias in relation to issues such as sport and religion. Key concerns reflected in audience contacts received by Audience and Consumer Affairs this year included 1 175 complaints about the March 2014 redesign of the iview service. These were largely about the useability of the new design, described by complainants as less user-friendly, and about technical bugs that affected some functionality such as saving programs to viewers' watchlists.116 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Governance 117 Corporate governance There were 979 complaints about the ABC's coverage of the 2013 Federal Election, 51% of which were allegations of bias. Of these, 48% alleged that coverage favoured the Government, 42% alleged that the Opposition was favoured and 10% were unspecified or alleged other bias. Audience and Consumer Affairs logged 800 complaints in relation to promotions. Concerns included that promotions were too intrusive (particularly television promotions shown during end credits and those broadcast in-program) and that some programs were not broadcast as promoted. There were 542 complaints about the ABC's 2013 New Year's Eve coverage. The vast majority of these complaints were in relation to the general quality of the broadcast. Of the 26 484 complaints received, 4 850 were claims of party political or other bias, 810 alleged lack of balance and 1 439 were claims of factual inaccuracy. These complaints related to a broad range of ABC programs and services. Accessibility complaints The ABC received some complaints during 2013-14 regarding closed captioning and audio description ser vices: Closed captioning \u2014107 complaints were made about closed captioning of television programs in the reporting period. These included complaints about the quality of captions as well as complaints about a failure to provide captions on various programs. Seven of the complaints investigated by Audience and Consumer Affairs resulted in findings that the ABC had failed to satisfy the requirements set out in the Broadcasting Services Act (1992) . The ACMA advised that it finalised one investigation into a complaint about closed captioning; no breach was found. Audio description \u2014The Australian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) notified the ABC that they accepted 21 complaints regarding the lack of on-going audio description on ABC Television programs. The ABC received funding to conduct a trial of the audio description service for a limited period in 2012 to test technical feasibility. Funding was only provided to cover the trial period, and there were a number of technical difficulties with the trial. The ABC does not consider that the failure to provide audio description services amounted to discrimination (whether direct or indirect) under the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 . The ABC advised the AHRC of its willingness to participate in a conciliation process with the AHRC and the complainants. Timeliness Audience and Consumer Affairs seeks to reply to all contacts requiring response within 30 days of receipt, in accordance with the timeliness standard for complaint handling that is specified in the ABC's Complaint Handling Procedures. In 2013-14, ABC Audience and Consumer Affairs responded directly to 14 775 audience contacts. Of these, 13 073 (88.5%) received responses within 30 days. Complaint outcomes During 2013-14, 26 666 written complaints were finalised by Audience and Consumer Affairs. The unit provided a personal response to 8 014 of these complaints (comprising 8 228 issues), of which 6 518 (81.3%) received responses within 30 days. 12 244 complaint contacts were referred to other areas of the Corporation for direct response and no substantive response was required for 6 408 complaint contacts. These 8 014 responses to complaints sent by Audience and Consumer Affairs this year includes two distinct groups of complaints: complaints investigated by Audience and Consumer Affairs which alleged breaches of the ABC Editorial Policies or ABC Code of Practice ; and complaints about matters of personal preference which do not raise issues of compliance with the ABC's editorial standards, and for which Audience and Consumer Affairs provide an audience liaison service.This latter group of complaints makes up the larger number of the total. As these complaints do not go to the ABC's editorial standards, they are not formally investigated and are not capable of being upheld. During 2013-14, 2 717 complaint issues were investigated. A total of 202 (7.4%) were upheld in cases where Audience and Consumer Affairs determined that ABC editorial standards had not been met. A further 300 issues were resolved (11.0%) after the relevant content area took prompt and appropriate action to remedy the cause of the complaint. All findings in relation to upheld and resolved complaints are brought to the attention of the senior editorial staff responsible. In 2013-14, actions taken in response to upheld and resolved complaints included written apologies to complainants; on-air corrections; counselling or other action with staff; removal of inappropriate content or correction of material on ABC Online; and reviews of and improvements to procedures. Summaries of upheld and resolved complaints are published on abc.net.au as individual complaints are finalised, providing timely access to complaint decisions. The ABC also publishes a quarterly statistical overview of audience contacts on its website.Australian Communications and Media Au thority Members of the public who complain to the ABC about matters covered by the ABC Code of Practice and who are dissatisfied with the ABC's response, or who do not receive a response to their complaint within 60 days, may seek review from the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA). During 2013-14, the ACMA advised the ABC that it had finalised investigations into 59 such matters (compared with 47 in 2012-13). In one case in 2013-14, the ACMA found a breach of the ABC Code of Practice : Harm and offence: ACMA concluded that a segment on The Hamster Decides which contained a manipulated image of journalist Mr Chris Kenny was intrinsically likely to have caused a high level of offence which was not justified by the editorial context.

Photo: Anastasia Konstantelos.The Bonner Committee is the ABC's primary advisory body on issues relating to Indigenous staff, content and communities. It is responsible for monitoring progress against the ABC's Reconciliation Action Plan 2013-15 . The Bonner Committee The Committee comprises a geographically -diver se mix of Indigenous and non-Indigenous staff. The Committe e's Chair is responsible for providing advice to the Managing Director in relation to issues of relevance to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander staff and relationships with Indigenous communitie s. The Committee met four times during the reporting period. The Bonner Committee discussed and considered a range of issues, including progress against RAP targets, advancing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander employment in the ABC, developing cultural protocols for content makers dealing with Indigenous communities, communicating Indigenous achievement within the Corporation and appropriate coverage of Indigenous ceremonies in news stories. The Committee is named after the late Neville Bonner AO, who was an ABC Board Director from 1983-91 and Australia's first Indigenous Senator. Reconciliation Action Plan In 2013-14, the ABC continued to pursue the commitments in RAP. The RAP commits the ABC to a set of concrete objectives and actions that acknowledge and value Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and their heritage and culture, as well as increasing employment opportunities and developing content that is about, created by, or features Indigenous Australians. The RAP operates on a calendar year basis. The ABC reported its performance most recently for the period 1 January to 31 December 2013. The RAP and the ABC's performance reports are also published on the Corporation's website: http://about.abc.net.au/ how-the-abc-is-run/our-plans/ . At 30 June 2014, the ABC had made good progress against the actions identified in the RAP, particularly in the area of employment. To support the achievement of the ABC's Indigenous employment objects established in the RAPO, the ABC is implementing an Indigenous Employment Strategy. The strategy includes actions intended to attract and retain Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander employees, including development of strategic partnerships and relationships with secondary and tertiary institutions. At 30 June 2014, the ABC employed 95 Indigenous staff, representing 1.98% of the workforce. The Corporation anticipates reaching and exceeding the 2% target early in the next financial year (see page 82).The ABC continued its project of installing plaques in ABC offices, designed and produced by Indigenous artists, to acknowledge the traditional owners of the land on which the building stands. In 2013-14, work was initiated to develop an ABC Editorial Policies Guidance Note to provide advice regarding Indigenou s content and coverage of Indigenous issues. The ABC developed and broadcast a broad range of programming across both of television and radio programs featuring Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, perspectives or issues (see pages 40 and 52). Consistent with the ABC's commitment to broadcasting content which reflects Australia's cultural diversity, the ABC continued to find opportuni ties for Indigenous employees to perform on-air roles, as well as in broader content -making areas. The RAP focuses on building relationships and community links. The ABC's State and Territory Directors continued to develop partnership and projects with Indigenous communities and organisations across the country. The ABC's procurement policies and procedures were reviewed to explicitly refer to the use of Indigenous suppliers. A range of activities and events were organised to recognise NAIDOC Week 2013 and Reconciliation Week 2014 in each State and Territory. The ABC's pop-up digital radio station was used to create ABC NAIDOC and ABC Reconciliation, which broadcast for the duration of each week (see page 52). Local Radio are producing station IDs incorporating Indigenous language wherever possible.The RAP 2013-15 comprises the following 25 initiatives across four key areas of focus: Respect Support the Bonner Committee, the ABC's Indigenous advisory group, which monitors and coordinates the ABC's Reconciliation Action Plan Provide staff with ongoing access to the \"Indigenous Culture in the ABC\" program Use appropriate cultural protocols including Acknowledgement or Welcome to Country at events Adopt appropriate cultural protocols for content makers Continue to recognise and participate in NAIDOC Week Establish an Indigenous site on the ABC Intranet to provide a unified source of information in relation to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander staff and issues Install signage and other physical recognition of the traditional owners of land and the contribution of Indigenous ABC staff in the public foyers and reception areas of ABC offices.

The ABC has a duty to use its funding efficiently and effectively. Good financial management is essential for the ABC to deliver its Charter obligations and provide maximum benefit to Australians. Across all demographics, the ABC gives Australians the opportunity to create and share their own stories. The ABC is embracing the democratisation of content creation, offering a unique environment in which to connect, learn and contribute, in a way that is open and accessible.

Financial Outcome 2013-14 As in previous years, the ABC operated within its total sources of funds and revenue from Government for the 2013-14 financial year. Sources of Funds 2013-14 The ABC was allocated $1 077.2 million in the May 2013 Federal Budget. The ABC also received $158.5 million from other sources, including ABC Commercial. The chart \"ABC Source of Funds\" depicts the ABC's budgeted funds for the various categories against actual sources for 2013-14 and its budgeted sources for 2 014-15.Application of Funds The chart \"ABC Split of Actual Expenditure\" broadly represents how the ABC allocated its funds by function in 2013-14. The Year Ahead Revenue from Government In the May 2014 Federal Budget, the Government announced a 1% ongoing reduction to the ABC's funding base as part of its ABC and SBS efficiency savings measure. The 1% reduction was described as a 'down payment' on the ABC and SBS Efficiency Study announced in January 2014. Funding provided to the ABC in May 2014 Budget included increases in previously announced Triennial Funding initiatives, with an additional $2.1 million for Enhanced News Services, and $7.0 million for Digital Delivery of Content. Funding also included $50 million of previously announced loan funding for the Melbourne Accommodation Project.134 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Financial Performance 135 Financial summary The ABC's funding for the 2014-15 financial year is: $m Total revenue from Government per Outcomes 1, 2, 3 and 4 and including equity injection/loan 1 113.6 Less Analog Transmission funds 76.1 Less Digital Television Transmission funds 115.0 Less Digital Radio Transmission funds 3.8 Less Loan funds 50.0 Total Revenue from Government 868.7 The chart \"ABC Revenue from Government by Output\" broadly represents the ABC's budgeted appropriation of funds by output for the 2014-15 financial year. In the May 2014 Federal Budget the Government also announced the termination of the Australia Network Service contract with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), with a total reduction of $196.8 million over the next nine years, including a reduction of half the previously budgeted funding for 2014-15. The Australia Network revenues are not included in the ABC's Revenue from Government appropriations, but are instead received as contract of service revenues directly from DFAT.Budget Strategy The Government's 1% efficiency reduction to base funding and cessation of the Australia Network contract have placed great pressure on ABC budgets. This comes on top of the continuing pressures from decline in contributions from ABC Commercial and ABC Resource Sales due to deteriorating market conditions, as well as increases in insurance, employer superannuation, and rights and royalty costs. With the Government still to announce the full impact on funding of the ABC and SBS Efficiency Study , the ABC faces an uncertain budget environment. Comparative Revenue from Government The 2014-15 operational revenue from Government of $869 million represents a decrease in real funding of $274 million or 24.0% since 1985-86, as depicted in the chart \"ABC Operational Revenue from Government\".

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies The principal accounting policies adopted in preparing the financial statements of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (the \"Corporation\" or \"ABC\") are stated to assist in a general understanding of these financial s tatements. The financial report for the Corporation for the year ended 30 June 2014 was authorised for issue by the Directors on 25 July 2014. 1.1 Objectives of the Corporation The Corporation is an Australian Government controlled not-for-profit entity. The objectives of the Corporation are derived explicitly from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 and are: Objective 1\u2014Ensure the Corporation's independence, integrity and high standards; Objective 2\u2014To be recognised as the leading Australian public media space where people engage with issues and ideas; Objective 3\u2014Deliver maximum benefit to the people of Australia through the effective and efficient delivery of the Corporation's services; and Objective 4\u2014Sustain and grow the Corporation through high quality leadership and an environment of responsibility and opportunity. The Corporation is structured to meet four outcomes: Outcome 1\u2014Informed, educated and entertained audiences throughout Australia and overseas through innovative and comprehensive media and related services; Outcome 2\u2014Audience access to ABC satellite and analog terrestrial radio and television transmission services is, at a minimum, maintained year-on-year through the management of Transmission Service Agreements; Outcome 3\u2014Audience access to ABC digital television services is provided, in accordance with Government approved implementation policy, through the roll-out and maintenance of the associated distribution and transmission infrastructure; and Outcome 4\u2014Audience access to ABC digital radio services is provided, in accordance with Government approved implementation policy, through the rollout and maintenance of the associated distribution and transmission infrastructure. The continued existence of the Corporation in its present form and with its present programs is dependent on Government policy and on continued funding by Parliament for the Corporation's administration and programs. 1.2 Basis of Preparation of Financial Statements The financial statements are general purpose financial statements and are required by clause 1(b) of Schedule 1 to the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 . The financial statements and notes have been prepared in accordance with: Finance Minister's Orders (FMOs) for reporting periods ending on or after 1 July 2013; and Australian Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) that apply for the reporting period. The Corporation's financial statements have been prepared on an accrual basis and in accordance with the historical cost convention, except for certain assets and liabilities which are at fair value. Except where stated, no allowance is made for the effect of changing prices on the results or the financial position. The financial statements are presented in Australian dollars and values are rounded to the nearest thousand dollars unless otherwise specified.148 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Financial Performance 149 Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2014Financial statements 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued 1.2 Basis of Preparation of Financial Statements continued Unless alternative treatment is specifically required by an accounting standard or the FMOs, assets and liabilities are recognised in the Statement of Financial Position when and only when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Corporation or a future sacrifice of economic benefits will be required and the amounts of the assets or liabilities can be reliably measured. However, assets and liabilities arising under executory agreements are not recognised unless required by an accounting standard. Assets and liabilities that are unrecognised are reported in the Schedule of Commitments or the Schedule of Contingencies (other than unquantifiable or remote contingencies, which are reported at Note 15: Contingent Assets and Liabilities). Unless alternative treatment is specifically required by an accounting standard, income and expenses are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income when and only when the flow, consumption or loss of e conomic benefits has occurred and can be reliably measured. 1.3 Significant Accounting Judgements, Estimates and Assumptions Significant Accounting Judgements In the process of applying the accounting policies listed in this note, the Corporation has taken the fair value of freehold land to be the market value of similar locations and the fair value of freehold buildings to be the depreciated replacement cost, as determined by an independent valuer. Significant Accounting Estimates and Assumptions The Corporation has applied the following estimates and assumptions: Long service leave, as detailed in Note 1.11: Employee Benefits and disclosed in Note 13A Employee p rovisions; Provision for make good, as detailed in Note 1.12: Leases and disclosed in Note 13B Other Provisions; Valuation of properties, plant and equipment, as detailed in Note 1.22: Property (Land and Buildings), Infrastructure, Plant and Equipment, Assets Held for Sale and disclosed in Note 10 Non-Financial Assets; Depreciation, as detailed in Note 1.22: Property (Land and Buildings), Infrastructure, Plant and Equipment, Assets Held for Sale and disclosed in Note 4C Depreciation and amortisation and Note 1 0 Non-Fi nancial A ssets; Impairment of non-financial assets, as detailed in Note 1.23: Impairment of Non-Current Assets; and Program amortisation, as detailed in Note 1.25: Inventories and disclosed in Note 10 Non-Financial Assets. No other accounting assumptions or estimates have been identified that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next year. 1.4 New Australian Accounting Standards Adoption of New Australian Accounting Standard Requirements No accounting standard has been adopted earlier than the application date stated in the standard. The following adopted requirements have affected the amounts reported in the current or prior periods or are estimated to have a financial effect in future reporting periods. AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement . AASB 13 has been issued to ensure consistency of fair value measurement and disclosure. It provides a single set of rules for how to measure fair value but does not specify when fair value should be applied as specified in the relevant Standard and the FMOs. The fair value hierarchy included within AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement is extended to all measures of fair value. This requires entities to classify fair value measurements into three levels of the fair value hierarchy. AASB 13 requires a number of significant new detailed disclosures for assets and liabilities carried at fair value. Comparatives are not required for the year ended 30 June 2014.Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2014 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued 1.4 New Australian Accounting Standards continued Adoption of New Australian Accounting Standard Requirements continued AASB 2011-4 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards to Remove Individual Key Management Personnel Disclosure Requirements . This removes the requirements to include individual key management personnel disclosures in the notes to the financial statements. The ABC follows the disclosure requirements as set in the FMOs, hence its disclosure requirements are governed accordingly. AASB 2012-2 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards Disclosures\u2014Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (June 2012) . AASB 7 is amended to increase the disclosures about offset positions, including t he gross position and the nature of the arrangements. AASB 119 Employee Benefits . A ASB 119 (reissued) introduces a single approach for the recognition and measurement of defined benefit plans although this change is not applicable to the ABC. Of greater significance to the ABC are the amended definitions of short-term and other long-term employee benefits. The change in definition shifts the focus to when the benefit is expected to be wholly settled rather than when it is due to be settled. This has implications for measurement of the annual leave benefit, on a discounted basis. It also changes the presentation of employee benefit amounts for key management personnel. While measurement of the liability may change, presentation of annual leave as a current liability will not. AASB 2011-8 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards arising from AASB 13 . This Standard amends existing fair value definitions, measurement requirements, disclosures and guidance located in other standards to ensure consistency with AASB 13 . AASB 2011-10 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards arising from AASB 119 (September 2011) . This Standard makes consequential amendments to other standards arising from the reissued A ASB 119 . AASB 2012-7 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards arising from Reduced Disclosure Requirements . The objective of this Standard is to make amendments to: AASB 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures ; AASB 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities ; AASB 101 Presentation of Financial Statements ; and AASB 127 Separate Financial Statements . Only minor impacts are expected. AASB 2012-10 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards\u2014Transition Guidance and Other Amendments . The objective of this Standard is to make amendments to: AASB 1 First-time Adoption of Australian Accounting Standards ; AASB 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations ; AASB 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures ; AASB 8 Operating Segments ; AASB 10 Consolidated Financial Statements ; AASB 11 Joint Arrangements ; AASB 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities ; AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement ; AASB 101 Presentation of Financial Statements ; and AASB 102 Inventories . This takes effect for reporting periods ending on or after 1 January 2013. The major impact on the ABC, being a not-for-profit organisation is to defer the implementation of AASBs 10, 11 and 12 until 1 January 2014. Other new, revised or amending standards or interpretations that are applicable to the current reporting period did not have a material financial impact, and are not expected to have a future financial impact on the Corporation. Future Australian Accounting Standard Requirements The following new standards, amendments to standards or interpretations have been issued by the AASB but are effective for future reporting periods. The impact of adopting these pronouncements, when effective, will not have a material financial impact on the Corporation's financial statements. AASB 9 Financial Instruments . AASB 9 incorporates the classification and measurement requirements for financial liabilities, and the recognition and de-recognition requirements for financial instruments, in addition to the classification and measurement requirements for financial assets (representing the first phase of a three phase project to replace AASB 139 ). This takes effect for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015. AASB 10 Consolidated Financial Statements . AASB 10 introduces a new approach to determining which investees should be consolidated. An investor controls an investee when the investor is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. It is expected to have minimal impact on the ABC. This takes effect for not-for-profit entities for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014.150 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Financial Performance 151 Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2014Financial statements 1. S ummary of Significant Accounting Policies continued 1.4 N ew Australian Accounting Standards continued Future Australian Accounting. Standard Requirements continued AASB 11 Joint Arrangements . This standard defines a joint arrangement as one where two or more parties are in a contractual agreement which binds them and gives them joint control over the joint arrangement. The standard distinguishes between joint operations whereby the controlling parties have contractual rights and obligations to individual assets and liabilities and joint ventures whereby the controlling parties have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. This takes effect for not-for-profit entities for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014. AASB 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities . AASB 12 contains the disclosure requirements for entities that have interests in subsidiaries, joint arrangements, associates and/or unconsolidated structured entities. This takes effect for not-for-profit entities for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014. AASB 128 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures (2011) . Limited amendments have been made, including the application of AASB 5 Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations to interests in associates and joint ventures and how to account for changes in interests and joint ventures. This takes effect for not-f or -p rofit entities for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014. AASB 2010-7 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards arising from AASB (December 2010) . This adds the requirements in AASB 139 in relation to the de-recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities to AASB 9. AASB 9 retains but simplifies the mixed measurement model and establishes two primary measurement categories for financial assets; amortised cost and fair value. The basis of classification depends on the entity's business model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset. The Standard applies to reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015. AASB 2011-7 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards arising from the Consolidation and Joint Venture Standards . This standard gives effect to many consequential changes to a number of standards arising from the new consolidation and joint arrangements standards. This takes effect for not-for-profit entities for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014. AASB 2012-3 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards\u2014Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (June 2012) . The amendments to AASB 132 clarify when an entity has a legally enforceable right to set off financial liabilities permitting entities to present balances net on the Statement of Financial Position. This takes effect for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014. AASB 1055 Budgetary Reporting . This standard requires reporting of budgetary information by not-for-profit entities within the General Government Sector (however, comparative information is not required). In particular, the original budget presented to Parliament, variance of actuals from budget; and explanations of significant variances are required. For-profit entities are excluded, as are Public Financial Corporations, Public Non-Financial Corporations and universities. This takes effect for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2014. Other new, revised or amending standards or interpretations that were issued and are applicable to future reporting periods are not expected to have a material financial impact on the Corporation in future reporting periods. 1.5 F oreign Currency Transactions The Corporation enters into foreign currency hedging arrangements to protect its purchasing power in relation to foreign currency exposures. Revenues and expenditures denominated in foreign currencies are converted to Australian dollars at the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction, or at the hedged rate. All gains and losses are taken to profit or loss with the exception of forward exchange contracts that are classified as cash flow hedges used to hedge highly probable transactions. Gains and losses on cash flow hedges held at balance date are taken to equity. All monetary foreign currency balances are converted to Australian dollars at the exchange rate prevailing at balance date. Monetary assets and liabilities of overseas branches and amounts payable to or by the Corporation in foreign currencies are translated into Australian dollars at the applicable exchange rate at balance date. 1. S ummary of Significant Accounting Policies continued 1.6 R eporting by Outcomes and Segments A comparison by outcomes relevant to the Corporation is presented in Note 23: Reporting by Outcomes. Any intra-government costs are eliminated in calculating the actual budget outcome for the Government overall. The Corporation principally provides a national television, radio and digital media service within the broadcasting industry. It is therefore considered for segmental reporting to operate predominantly in one industry and in one geographical area, Australia. 1.7 Revenue Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when: the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer; the Corporation retains no managerial involvement or effective control over the goods; the revenue and transaction costs incurred can be reliably measured; and it is probable that the economic benefit associated with the transaction will flow to the Corporation. Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised at fair value of the consideration received net of the amount of GST upon delivery of the goods to customers. Revenue from rendering of services is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of contracts at the reporting date. Revenue is recognised when: the amount of revenue, stage of completion and transaction costs incurred can be reliably measured; and the probable economic benefits with the transaction will flow to the Corporation. The stage of completion of contracts at the reporting date is determined by reference to the proportion that costs incurred to date bear to the estimated total costs of the transaction. Credit sales are on normal commercial terms. Receivables for goods and services, which have 30 day terms, are recognised at the nominal amounts due, less any impairment allowance for bad and doubtful debts. The collectability of debts is reviewed at the balance date. Provisions are made when the collectability of debt is no longer probable. Interest revenue is recognised using the effective interest method as set out in AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement . Subsidies, grants, sponsorships and donations are recognised on receipt unless paid to the Corporation for a specific purpose where recognition of revenue will be recognised in accordance with the agreement. Revenue from Government Parliament appropriates monies to the Department of Communications, which is then distributed to the Corporation and recognised as revenue from Government. The full amount received in respect of departmental outputs for the year is disclosed in Note 6: Revenue from Government. Revenues from Government receivable are recognised at their nominal amounts. 1.8 G ains and losses Sale of Assets Gains or losses from disposal of assets are recognised when control of the asset has passed to the buyer. 1.9 Grants The Corporation receives grant monies from time to time. Most grant agreements require the Corporation to perform services or provide facilities, or to meet eligibility criteria. A liability in respect of unearned revenues is recognised to the extent the services or facilities have not been provided or eligibility criteria have not been met.152 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Financial Performance 153 Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2014Financial statements 1. S ummary of Significant Accounting Policies continued 1.10 T ransactions with the Government as Owner Where the Corporation is required to return unspent funds to the Government and this return is discretionary, amounts returned are recognised as a return of equity in the year in which the Minister agrees to the return amount. Equity Injections Amounts appropriated by the Parliament as equity injections are recognised as contributed equity in accordance with the FMOs. Other Distributions to Owners The FMOs require that distributions to owners be debited to contributed equity unless it is in the nature of a dividend. Contributions Income is measured at the fair value of the contributions received or receivable. Income arising from the contribution of an asset to the Corporation is recognised when the entity obtains control of the contribution or the right to receive the contribution, it is probable that the economic benefits comprising the contribution will flow to the Corporation and the amount of the contribution can be measured reliably. 1.11 E mployee Benefits Liabilities for services rendered by employees are recognised at the reporting date to the extent that they have not been settled. Liabilities for short-term employee benefits (as defined in AASB 119 Employee Benefits ) and termination benefits expected to be wholly settled within twelve months are measured at their nominal amounts. The nominal amount is calculated with regard to the rates expected to be paid on settlement of the liability. All other employee benefit liabilities are measured at the present value of the estimated future cash outflows to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the reporting date. Leave The liability for employee benefits includes provision for annual leave and long service leave. No provision has been made for sick leave as all sick leave is non-vesting and the average sick leave taken in future years by employees is estimated to be less than the annual entitlement for sick leave. The leave liabilities are calculated on the basis of employees' remuneration at the estimated salary rates that will apply at the time the leave is taken, including the employer superannuation contribution rates to the extent that the leave is likely to be taken during service rather than paid out on termination. The liability for long service leave for the Corporation has been determined by reference to the work of an actuary, PricewaterhouseCoopers Securities Ltd, as at 30 June 2014. The liability for long service leave represents the present value of the estimated future cash outflows to be made by the Corporation resulting from employees' services provided up to the balance date. The estimate of the present value of the liability takes into account attrition rates and pay increases through promotion and inflation. Superannuation Employees are members of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme (CSS), Public Sector Superannuation Scheme (PSS), the Public Sector Superannuation Accumulation Plan Scheme (PSSap) or another non-C ommonwealth Superannuation fund. The CSS and PSS are defined benefit schemes for the Australian Government. The PSSap and other non-C ommonwealth funds are defined contribution schemes. The liability for defined benefits is recognised in the financial statements of the Australian Government and is settled by the Australian Government in due course. This liability is reported by the Department of Finance's administered schedules and notes.1. S ummary of Significant Accounting Policies continued 1.11 E mployee Benefits continued Superannuation continued The Corporation makes employer contributions to the employee defined benefit superannuation schemes at rates determined by an actuary to be sufficient to meet the current cost to the Government of the superannuation entitlements of the Corporation's employees. The Corporation accounts for the contributions in the same manner as contributions to defined contribution plans. The liability for superannuation recognised as at 30 June 2014 represents outstanding contributions at the end of the period. 1.12 Leases A distinction is made between finance leases and operating leases. Finance leases effectively transfer from the lessor to the lessee substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of leased non-current assets. An operating lease is a lease that is not a finance lease. In operating leases, the lessor effectively retains substantially all such risks and benefits. Operating lease payments are expensed on a straight line basis which is representative of the pattern of benefits derived from the leased assets. Operating lease rentals are not segregated between minimum lease payments, contingent rents and sublease payments, as required by AASB 117 Leases , as these components are not individually material. Lease incentives taking the form of 'free' leasehold improvements and rent holidays are recognised as liabilities. These liabilities are reduced by allocating lease payments between rental expense and reduction of the liability. Provision for Make Good A provision for make good exists when the Corporation has an obligation to 'make good' leased properties at the end of the lease term. As many of the leases are negotiable, the Corporation has determined the provision as set out below. Retail leased premises A provision has been recognised for retail leases where the Corporation is obligated per the lease agreement to make good the site or where the Corporation believes there is some probability that it will incur costs to make good the site. The provision is calculated based on the estimated average cost to make good each site, plus an allowance for inflation. Other leased premises A provision has been recognised for other leases where the Corporation is obligated per the lease agreement to make good the site or where the Corporation believes there is some likelihood that it will incur costs to make good the site. The provision is calculated based on the estimated cost to make good each site, plus an allowance for inflation. 1.13 B orrowing Costs All borrowing costs are expensed as incurred. 1.14 F air Value Measurement The Corporation has adopted the following general policies relating to the fair value treatment of non-current assets. The Cost approach, more specifically depreciated replacement cost, is the basis for valuing the buildings, fit-out and site improvements as they are typically specialist in nature as they are typically built with broadcasting in mind. This also applies to the Corporation's plant and equipment which is specialised in nature. The Market approach is the basis for valuing the land component of ABC property because it is possible to base the fair value on recent sales of comparable sites. The Corporation's valuers have detailed these reference sites in individual valuation reports for each property.154 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Financial Performance 155 Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2014Financial statements 1. S ummary of Significant Accounting Policies continued 1.14 F air Value Measurement continued Generally the fair value of the Corporation's financial assets and liabilities (excluding long term loans) is deemed to be their carrying value. The fair value of long term loans is the net present value of future discounted cash -fl ows arising. 1.15 C ash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents are recognised at their nominal amounts. Cash and cash equivalents include: cash on hand; and cash at bank and short term deposits with an original maturity of 3 months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. 1.16 F inancial Assets The Corporation classifies its financial assets in the following categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss; held-to-maturity investments; available-for-sale financial assets; and loans and receivables. The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition. Financial assets are recognised and derecognised upon trade date. Effective Interest Method The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset and of allocating interest income over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset, or, where appropriate, a shorter period. Income is recognised on an effective interest rate basis except for financial assets that are recognised at fair value through profit or loss. Financial Assets at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss Financial assets are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) where the financial assets: a) h ave been acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the near future; b) a re derivatives that are not designated and effective as a hedging instrument; or c) a re parts of an identified portfolio of financial instruments that the Corporation manages together and has a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking. Assets in this category are classified as current assets. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised in profit or loss. The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss incorporates any interest earned on the financial asset. The Corporation's financial assets in this category are forward exchange contracts which are derivative financial instruments. Gains and losses on these items are recognised through profit or loss except if they are classified as a cash flow hedge where they are recognised in the hedging reserve within equity. Derivatives Forward exchange contracts are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which the contract is entered into and are subsequently revalued to reflect changes in fair value. Forward exchange contracts are carried as assets when their net fair value is positive and as liabilities when their net fair value is negative. For the purpose of hedge accounting, the Corporation's hedges are classified as cash flow hedges when they hedge exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable either to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset, liability or to a highly probable forecast transaction.1. S ummary of Significant Accounting Policies continued 1.16 F inancial Assets continued Financial Assets at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss continued At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Corporation formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which the Corporation wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the Corporation will assess the hedging instrument's effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item's fair value or cash flow attributable to the hedged risk. Such hedges are expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows and are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that they actually have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which they were designated. The effective portion of the gain or loss on the cash flow hedge is recognised directly in equity, while the ineffective portion is recognised in profit or loss. Amounts taken to equity are transferred to profit or loss when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when hedged income or expenses are recognised or when a forecast sale or purchase occurs. When the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or liability, the amounts taken to equity are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability. If the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in equity are transferred to profit or loss. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recognised in equity remain until the forecast transaction occurs. If the related transaction is not expected to occur, the amount is taken to profit or loss. Held-to-Maturity Investments Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity dates that the Corporation has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity investments in accordance with AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement . Held-to-maturity investments are recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest method less impairment, with revenue recognised on an effective yield basis. Surplus cash has been invested into short term investments with maturities at acquisition date of greater than three months. These investments are included as 'other receivables'. Loans and Receivables Trade receivables, loans and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are classified as loans and receivables in accordance with AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement . They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the Statement of Financial Position date. These are classified as non-current assets. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less impairment. Interest is recognised by applying the effective interest rate. Trade receivables are normally settled within 30 days unless otherwise agreed and are carried at amounts due, less an allowance for impairment. Impairment of Financial Assets Financial assets are assessed for impairment at each balance date. Financial assets held at amortised cost If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred for loans and receivables or held to maturity investments held at amortised cost, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the asset's original effective interest rate. 156 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Financial Performance 157 Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2014Financial statements 1. S ummary of Significant Accounting Policies continued 1.16 F inancial Assets continued Impairment of Financial Assets continued The carrying amount is reduced by way of an allowance account. The loss is taken to the Statement of Comprehensive Income. Bad and doubtful debts The Corporation makes a specific provision for debts considered doubtful by conducting a detailed review of material debtors, making an assessment of the likelihood of recovery of those debts and taking into account past bad debts experience. Bad debts are written off when identified. 1.17 F inancial Liabilities Financial liabilities are classified as 'other financial liabilities' in accordance with AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement . Other Financial Liabilities Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. The fair value of loans from Government is deemed to be the initial principal amount. Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period. Loans are classified as current liabilities unless the Corporation has the unconditional right to defer settlement for at least 12 months after the Statement of Financial Position date. Supplier and other payables are recognised at amortised cost. Liabilities are recognised to the extent that the goods or services have been received (and irrespective of having been invoiced). Standard ABC settlement terms are 30 days commercial. 1.18 Re pairs and Maintenance Maintenance, repair expenses and minor renewals which do not constitute an upgrade or enhancement of equipment are expensed as incurred. 1.19 J oint Ventures Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method in accordance with AASB 128 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures and the FMO. Further details relating to joint ventures, to which the Corporation is a party, are provided in Note 9: Investments Accounted for Using the Equity Method. 1.20 C ontingent Assets and Contingent Liabilities Contingent assets and contingent liabilities are not recognised in the Statement of Financial Position but are disclosed in the Schedule of Contingencies and Note 15: Contingent Assets and Liabilities. They may arise from uncertainty as to the existence of an asset or liability, or represent an asset or liability in respect of which the amount cannot be reliably measured. Contingent assets are disclosed when settlement is probable but not virtually certain and contingent liabilities are disclosed when settlement is greater than remote. 1. S ummary of Significant Accounting Policies continued 1.21 Ac quisition of Assets Assets are recorded at cost at the time of acquisition except as stated below. The cost of acquisition includes the fair value of assets transferred in exchange and liabilities undertaken. Assets acquired at no cost, or for nominal consideration, are recognised as assets at their fair value, at acquisition date. 1.22 P roperty (Land and Buildings), Infrastructure, Plant and Equipment, Assets Held for Sale Asset Recognition Threshold Purchases of property, infrastructure, plant and equipment are recognised initially at cost in the Statement of Financial Position. Purchases costing less than $2 000 are expensed in the year of acquisition except where they form part of a project or group of similar items, which are significant in total. Basis of Revaluation Land, buildings, infrastructure, plant and equipment are carried at fair value. Fair values for each class of asset are determined as shown below. Asset Class Fair Value Measured at Freehold Land Market value Freehold Buildings Depreciated replacement cost Leasehold Land Depreciated replacement cost Leasehold Buildings Depreciated replacement cost Leasehold Improvements Depreciated replacement cost Infrastructure, plant and equipment Depreciated replacement cost Following initial recognition at cost, property, infrastructure, plant and equipment are carried at fair value less subsequent accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Valuations are conducted with sufficient frequency to ensure that the carrying amounts of assets do not materially vary, with the assets' fair values as at the reporting date. The regularity of independent valuations depends upon the volatility of movements in market values for the relevant assets. Revaluation adjustments are made on a class basis. Any revaluation increment is credited to equity under the heading of revaluation reserve except to the extent that it reverses a previous revaluation decrement of the same asset class that was previously recognised through profit or loss. Revaluation decrements for a class of assets are recognised directly through profit or loss except to the extent that they reverse a previous revaluation increment for that class. Any accumulated depreciation as at the revaluation date is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the asset restated to the revalued amount. Depreciation Depreciable property, infrastructure, plant and equipment assets are written-off to their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method of depreciation. Leasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the estimated useful life of the improvements or the unexpired period of the lease. Depreciation rates (useful lives) and methods are reviewed at each reporting date and necessary adjustments are recognised in the current, or current and future reporting periods, as appropriate.158 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Financial Performance 159 Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2014Financial statements 1. S ummary of Significant Accounting Policies continued 1.22 P roperty (Land and Buildings), Infrastructure, Plant and Equipment, Assets Held for Sale continued Depreciation continued Depreciation rates applying to each class of depreciable asset are initially based on the following useful lives: 2014 2013 Leasehold land\u2014long term 99 to 120 years 99 to 120 years Buildings on freehold land 50 years 50 years Leasehold buildings Life of Lease (up to 50 years) Life of Lease (up to 50 years) Leasehold improvements 5 to 50 years 5 to 50 years Infrastructure, plant and equipment 3 to 15 years 3 to 15 years The aggregate amount of depreciation and amortisation allocated for each class of asset during the reporting period is disclosed in Note 4C: Depreciation and amortisation. Assets Held for Sale Assets held for sale are stated in the Statement of Financial Position at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. Impairment losses are recognised for any initial or subsequent write-down of assets classified as held for sale to their fair value less costs to sell. Any gains for subsequent increases in fair value less costs to sell for assets classified as held for sale are recognised only to the extent that they are not in excess of the cumulative impairment losses that have been recognised in accordance with AASB 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations or previously in accordance with AASB 136 Impairment of Assets . If any assets classified as held for sale no longer meet the criteria under AASB 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations , the Corporation will cease to classify the asset as held for sale. Non-current assets that cease to be classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of: a. t he carrying amount before the asset was classified as held for sale, adjusted for any depreciation, amortisation or revaluations that would have been recognised had the asset not been classified as held for sale; and b. t he recoverable amount at the date of the subsequent decision not to sell. 1.23 I mpairment of Non-Current Assets All non-current assets except: inventories; assets arising from employee benefits; financial assets that are within the scope of AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement ; and non-current assets (or disposal groups) classified as held for sale in accordance with AASB 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations ; are subject to an assessment as to indicators of impairment under AASB 136 Impairment of Assets . At the reporting date, the Corporation has assessed whether there are any indications that assets may be impaired. Where indications of impairment exist, the asset's recoverable amount is estimated and an impairment adjustment made if the asset's recoverable amount is less than its carrying amount.1. S ummary of Significant Accounting Policies continued 1.23 I mpairment of Non-Current Assets continued Recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset. Where the future economic benefit of an asset is not primarily dependent on the asset's ability to generate future cash flows, and the asset would be replaced if the Corporation were deprived of the asset, its value in use is taken to be its depreciated replacement cost. 1.24 I ntangible Assets The Corporation's intangibles comprise software for internal use, broadcast licences and spectrum provided by the Australian Government. Software is initially recognised at cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over anticipated useful lives between 3-8 years (2013 3-8 years). These assets are assessed for indications of impairment. The carrying amounts of impaired assets are written down to the lower of their net market selling price or depreciated replacement cost. The Corporation's right to use broadcast licences and spectrum are held at their fair value. 1.25 Inventories Inventories held for resale are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Inventories not held for resale are valued at the lower of cost, adjusted for any loss in service potential, based on the existence of a current replacement cost that is lower than the original acquisition cost or other subsequent carrying amount. Produced Programs Television programs are produced for domestic transmission and include direct salaries and expenses and production overheads allocated on a usage basis to the program. Production overheads not allocated to programs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. External contributions received in respect of co-production of television programs are offset against production costs which are recorded as Inventories in the Statement of Financial Position. The cost of produced television program inventory is amortised as follows: News, Current Affairs and Live Programs\u2014100% on first screening; Factual and Entertainment programs based on current topics\u2014100% on first screening; Childrens, Education and Movies\u2014straight line over three years from completion of production; All other programs not covered above\u201490% first screening and 10% second screening or in third year; and Programs not shown within three years of completion or purchase to be amortised 100% in year three. The costs of programs produced for Radio are expensed as incurred. Such programs are normally broadcast soon after production, stock on hand at any time being minimal. Purchased Programs Purchased program inventory is amortised in accordance with the policy noted above or over the rights period of the contract (whichever is lesser). Subsequent sales of residual rights are recognised in the period in which they occur. Write-down of Merchandise Inventory The amount of any write-down of inventories to net realisable value and all losses of inventory are recognised as an expense in the period the write-down or loss occurs. The amount of any reversal of any write-down of inventories arising from an increase in the net realisable value will be recognised as a reduction in the amount of inventories recognised as an expense in the period in which the reversal occurs.160 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Financial Performance 161 Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2014Financial statements 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued 1.25 Inventories continued Write-down of Inventory Held for Distribution When inventories held for distribution are distributed, the carrying amount of those inventories is recognised as an expense. The amount of any write-down of inventories for loss of service potential, and all losses of inventories are recognised as an expense in the period the write-down or loss occurs. The amount of any reversal of any write-down of inventories arising from a reversal of the circumstances that gave rise to the loss of service potential will be recognised as a reduction in the amount of inventories recognised as an expense in the period in which the reversal occurs. 1.26 P rovisions Provisions are recognised when the Corporation has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, where it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. 1.27 Taxation Income tax The Corporation is not subject to income tax pursuant to Section 71 of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 . The Corporation's controlled entities, Music Choice Australia Pty Ltd and The News Channel Pty Limited, while subject to income tax, have been inactive since the year ended 30 June 2000 up to and including 30 June 2014. The Corporation's equity interests in MediaHub Australia Pty Limited, Freeview Australia Pty Limited and National DAB Licence Company Limited are subject to income tax. Goods and Services Tax (GST) Revenues, gains, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of GST except where the amount of GST incurred is not recoverable from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). In these circumstances, the GST is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the revenue or expense. Receivables and payables are stated with the amount of GST included. The net amount of GST receivable from the ATO is included as a financial asset in the Statement of Financial Position while any net amount of GST payable to the ATO is included as a liability in the Statement of Financial P osition. Cash flows are included in the Cash Flow Statement on a net basis. The GST components arising from investing and financing activities which are recoverable from or payable to the ATO are classified as operating cash flows. Commitments and contingencies are disclosed on a net basis. Net GST commitments recoverable from, or payable to the ATO are disclosed. 2. Events after the Reporting Period Australia Network Service On 13 May 2014, the ABC received a notice of termination from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) concerning the contract to deliver the Australia Network Service, consisting of Radio Australia, the Australian Network TV Service and multimedia digital services. This notice was a termination for convenience requiring the ABC to deliver the service until 18 September 2014. Under the terms of the contract, the ABC was entitled to recover any amounts that had been Legally Committed for Expenditure from DFAT, subject to the appropriation of funds being made available to DFAT for the purpose of reimbursing the ABC. The Federal Budget, without any consultation with the ABC, provided DFAT with $10 588 000 to fund the operation of the service up until 18 September 2014, and to reimburse the ABC for any monies that have been Legally Committed for Expenditure in accordance with the contract, which is entitled Funding Agreement for the Provision of a Multiplatform International Media Service . DFAT, without reference to, or assistance from the ABC, determined that $4 588 000 would be provided in relation to the continuation of the service to 18 September 2014, and $6 000 000 would be made available to reimburse the ABC for any Legally Committed Expenditure. As at 25 July 2014, the Australian Government Solicitor (AGS), acting on behalf of DFAT, has approved $3 041 126 for reimbursements related to Legally Committed Expenditure, being $1 389 000 in relation to Program Inventory, and $1 652 126 in relation to various contracts. This leaves an amount of $2 958 874 outstanding and available to offset other Legally Committed Expenditure, including redundancy costs. Separately, the AGS has indicated that redundancy costs will only be considered for reimbursement once the actual redundancy payments have been made to employees. The ABC estimates that the redundancy costs associated with the closure of the service will be around $10 700 000. In view of the gap between the amount available from DFAT, and the estimated redundancy payments for the Australia Network staff, the ABC reached agreement with DFAT on 9 July 2014 to permit the service to be closed ahead of the 18 September 2014 date, with savings achieved through the early termination, able to be applied against the shortfall in termination costs. Work to achieve an early closure is currently underway within the ABC. On 14 July 2014, the ABC entered into consultation with staff over the final closure of the Australia Network Service, including associated redundancies. This consultation is continuing. 162 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Financial Performance 163 Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2014Financial statements 3.

As at 30 June 2014 the Corporation had returned $10 865 833 (2013 $8 555 207) as a repayment of capital related to unspent transmission revenue in previous years. 7. Fair Value Measurements The Corporation has adopted the amendment to AASB 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures , which requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level in accordance with the following fair value measurement hierarchy: Level 1\u2014quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2\u2014inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices); and Level 3\u2014inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). The Corporation does not hold any assets or liabilities that are classified as Level 1 inputs (i.e. with reference to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities). Consequently there have been no recurring fair value measurements transferred between Level 1 and Level 2 for assets and liabilities to 30 June 2014. The fair values of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example over the counter derivatives) are determined using valuation techniques. The Corporation uses a variety of methods and makes assumptions that are based on market conditions at the end of each reporting period. The fair value of forward exchange contracts are determined using a Level 2 technique based on the forward exchange rates at the end of the reporting period. The fair value of forward exchange contracts at 30 June 2014 was a liability of $184 8 97 (2013 asset of $413 868). The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, financial assets and non-interest bearing financial liabilities (with the exception of derivatives used for hedging) of the Corporation approximates their fair value and as such they ha ve been omitted from these disclosures.166 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Financial Performance 167 Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2014Financial statements 7.

The Corporation's policies are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in the Corporation's activities. There has been no change in the policies from the previous year. Compliance with policies and exposure limits are reviewed by the Corporation's internal auditors on a continuous basis. To meet the Corporation's financial risk management objectives, surplus cash is invested into short term, highly liquid investments with maturities at acquisition date of greater than three months. These investments are included as 'other receivables'. The Corporation's Treasury function provides advice and services to the business, coordinates access to foreign currency contracts and monitors and assesses the financial risks relating to the operations of the Corporation through internal risk reports. Where appropriate, the Corporation seeks to minimise the effects of its financial risks by using derivative financial instruments to hedge its risk exposures. The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Corporation's policies as approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on foreign exchange risk, credit risk, the use of financial derivatives and investment of funds. The Corporation does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.20. F inancial Instruments continued 20.4 F air Values of Financial Instruments Forward exchange contracts The fair values of forward exchange contracts are taken to be the unrealised gain or loss at balance date calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles. Loans from Government The fair values of long term borrowings are estimated using discounted cash flow analysis, based on current interest rates for liabilities with similar risk profiles. At 30 June 2014, the Corporation had drawn down a $20 000 000 (2013 Nil) loan from the Department of Finance, maturing on 8 April 2017. This is part of a $90 000 000 loan facility to cash-flow the construction of a purpose-built facility in Southbank, Melbourne. The above methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values as summarised in the table below: 20.4A Fair value of financial instruments Carrying amount 2014 $'000Fair value 2014 $'000Carrying amount 2013 $'000Fair value 2013 $'000 Financial Assets Forward exchange contracts - - 371 371 Total - - 371 371 Financial Liabilities Loans from Department of Finance 20 000 20 176 - - Forward exchange contracts 290 290 - - Total 20 290 20 466 - - 20.5 C redit Risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Corporation. Credit risk arises from the financial assets of the Corporation, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, available-for-sale financial assets and derivative instruments. The Corporation has adopted a policy of only dealing with credit worthy counterparties and obtaining collateral where appropriate, as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults. The Corporation assesses credit ratings through independent ratings agencies and if not available, uses publicly available financial information and its own trading record to rate customers. The Corporation manages its credit risk by undertaking credit checks on customers who wish to take on credit terms. The Corporation has policies that set limits for each individual customer. Ongoing credit evaluations are performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable. The Corporation has no material concentration of credit risk with any single customer as the Corporation has a large number of customers spread across a range of industries and geographical areas. The credit risk arising from dealings in financial instruments is controlled by a strict policy of credit approvals, limits and monitoring procedures. Credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors. The Corporation does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty. The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with credit ratings of at least A- as assigned by Standard & Poors.188 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Financial Performance 189 Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2014Financial statements 20.

The Corporation's activities expose it primarily to the financial risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates arising from transactions and assets and liabilities that are denominated in a currency that is not Australian dollars. The Corporation enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge the foreign exchange rate risk arising from some of these transactions. These forward exchange contracts are not designated as cash flow hedges. The Corporation is exposed to foreign currency denominated in United States Dollars (USD), Great British Pounds (GBP) and Euros (EUR). The table at Note 20.7 Market Risk details the effect on the profit and equity as at 30 June 2014 from a 11.5% (2013 15.7%) favourable/unfavourable change in the rate of the Australian Dollar (AUD) against the currencies to which the Corporation is exposed, with all other variables held constant. 20. F inancial Instruments continued 20.9 I nterest Rate Risk Interest rate risk refers to the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Corporation is typically not exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings, as all borrowings are at fixed interest rates. The Corporation derives interest revenue from funds invested, which is impacted by interest rate fluctuations. Although, the Corporation is not dependent on interest revenue to continue operations, the table Note 20.7 Market Risk illustrates the impact of a 0.60% (2013 1.20%) movement in the interest rate, on interest revenues. The change in interest revenue is proportional to the change in interest rates. 20.10 H edging Instruments Specific Hedges The Corporation enters into forward exchange contracts to cover specific foreign currency payments when exposures of $50 000 or greater (equivalent) are entered into under a firm contract for goods or services involving a specific foreign currency amount and payment date. Exposures are covered if they fall within a set period, which can generally be a minimum of 3 months or maximum of 6 months subject to market conditions. The balance of the hedging reserve in equity is zero, partly reflecting a net loss of $149 274 (2013 net gain of $74 231) on specific hedges of foreign currency purchases as at 30 June 2014. The Corporation's cash flow hedges were all effective during the period. The following table sets out the gross value to be received under forward exchange contracts, the weighted average contracted exchange rates and the settlement periods of outstanding contracts for the Corporation.

General cover is typically held between 40% and 60% of estimated exposures for USD, GBP and EUR subject to market conditions. At balance date, the Corporation held forward exchange contracts to buy USD, GBP and EUR. Gains/losses arising from general hedges outstanding at year end have been taken to profit or loss. The net loss of $35 623 (2013 net gain $339 637) on general hedges of anticipated foreign currency purchases from July 2013 to June 2014 has been recognised at balance date through profit or loss.192 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Financial Performance 193 Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2014Financial statements 21.

reporting risk areas.Appendices 200 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Appendices 201 Appendix 3\u2014ABC Organisation, as at 30 June 2014 Managing Director Mark Scott AO Chief of

It made two recommendations and 2 1 c ommendations. Advisory Council members Member Ms Joan McKain, Convenor (Lake Cathie, NSW) Mr Scott Cowans (Ellenbrook, WA) Ms Kate Duncan (Coburg North, Victoria) Mrs Charmaine Foley (Nambour, Queensland) Ms Kez Hall (Darwin, NT) Mrs Rena Henderson (Preston, Tasmania) Mr Nakul Legha (Gungahlin, ACT) Ms Heron Loban (Oxley, Queensland) Mr Rob Ryan (Holland Park East, Queensland) Mr Ben Spence (Narrabri, NSW) Summary of recommendations, responses and commendations 2013-14 Recommendations Recommendation R1/2/13 \u2014Depiction of smoking on television The Advisory Council recommends that the ABC investigate the proliferation of cigarette smoking and other drug use in television programs with a view to ensuring that, as far as possible, any such depiction is not gratuitous and can be justified by context. Director of Television: ABC Television does not believe there has been a proliferation of cigarette smoking or other drug use in its programs, and is confident that depictions of such activities are justified by context.There is a difficult balance to be struck by program makers between the danger of encouraging potentially damaging habits, particularly among the young, and the need to realistically reflect the range of public attitudes and behaviour. The ABC considers that in drama, comedy and factual programs, there are cases where depictions of smoking or drug use are essential to a character or story. In making judgements about the suitability of programs for particular audiences and classification time zones, ABC Television's classifiers take note of smoking and drug use, particularly when programs are directed at a younger audience. ABC Television also takes note of the requirements of the Tobacco Advertising Prohibitions Act 1992 . The Associated Standard on Television Program Classification contains specific guidelines for drug use at each classification level, which are carefully applied by the ABC's classifiers. Depictions of smoking and other drug use are also captured within Section 7 (Harm and Offence) of the ABC Editorial P olicies . Depictions which promote or encourage drug use are n ot permitted at any classification level. In practice, this often means that content will include the depiction of the drug users experiencing negative consequences or living in bleak circumstances; in this way, drug use is neither glorified nor advocated within ABC Television content. Recommendation R1/1/14 \u2014Q&A Following the success of the Q&A program featuring Christine Lagarde, the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, the Advisory Council recommends future Q&A programs focus on single-issue topics with guests who have extensive expertise.Director of Television: Q&A is looking for opportunities to feature single guests rather than a panel to enable in-depth questioning from audiences. The program has traditionally adopted a single -gu est format for significant political leaders such as the Prime Minister. This format has also been used successfully to feature guests such as Bill Gates and Christine Lagarde. Commendations Science Forum The ABC Advisory Council commends the Western Australia State Director and ABC staff for the outstanding Science Forum held in July 2013. Professor Fiona Stanley and Professor Lyn Beazley made a valuable contribution to the event which involved an impressive array of guests. The Council was pleased that Central Perth TAFE students were invited to produce a video of the event. The Checkout The ABC Advisory Council commends the makers of The Checkout for the well-researched programs which meet the ABC's Charter obligations of informing, educating and entertaining Australians. Adam Hills Tonight The ABC Advisory Council commends Adam Hills Tonight for innovative comedic ideas, clever use of audience participation, and entertaining guests. Cliffy The ABC Advisory Council commends Cliffy , the dramatisation of Cliff Young's victory in the 1983 Sydney to Melbourne Ultra Marathon. It was a heart -warming depiction of an epic accomplishment by a unique Australian, featuring an Australian cast. ABC On The Road (ABC Exhibition Trailer) The ABC Advisory Council commends the work of the ABC Exhibition Trailer team. Since its launch, the Exhibition Trailer has exhibited at over 200 events nationally in more than 60 locations. It has travelled around Australia eight times and provided a valuable connection between the ABC and Australian c ommunities. Recognition of Traditional OwnersThe Advisory Council commends the Bonner Committee and State and Territory Directors for the national approach to reconciliation. The ABC has recognised the traditional custodians of the land by unveiling plaques at ABC offices in capital cities.Four Corners \u2014\"Fashion Victims\" The Advisory Council commends Sarah Ferguson and the Four Corners team for Fashion Victims . This powerful documentary revealed the human cost paid by workers engaged in garment manufacturing in Bangladesh for fashion retailers in wealthy nations such as Australia. Autopsy on a Dream and The Dream of P erfection The ABC Advisory Council commends the ABC for delivering the 1968 BBC documentary, Autopsy on a Dream to Australian audiences together with The Dream of Perfection . The two documentaries marked the 40th anniversary of an iconic Australian landmark, the Sydney Opera House. 2013 Federal Election coverage The ABC Advisory Council commends the ABC for its outstanding multi-platform coverage of the 2013 Federal election. The coverage fulfilled the ABC Charter to inform, educate and entertain through the variety of content, competent reporting and presenting, and innovations such as Vote Compass and Fact Check . Management of the ABC The ABC Advisory Council commends ABC management for supporting the reporting of surveillance by intelligence agencies. The story was in the public interest and demonstrates the independence of the ABC. Redesign My Brain with Todd Sampson The ABC Advisory Council commends the production team of the Redesign My Brain with Todd Sampson series. The series was engaging and e ducational. Redfern Now \u2014Series 2 The ABC Advisory Council commends the production team of Redfern Now , Series 2, which explored controversial issues in a realistic manner. The Council was impressed by the storylines, acting and direction. Redfern Now , Series 1 and 2, have made a valuable contribution to reconciliation. Kakadu The ABC Advisory Council commends the production team of the Kakadu series, which showcased the National Park using dramatic cinematography. The series demonstrated the continuing ecological and spiritual value of Kakadu .Appendix 4\u2014ABC Advisory Council continuedAppendices 204 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Appendices 205 Appendix 4\u2014ABC Advisory Council continued Keating The ABC Advisory Council commends Kerry O'Brien and the production team of Keating . Kerry O'Brien's in-depth questioning enabled the audience to gain an understanding of Keating's political life, character and personality. Dr Who The ABC Advisory Council commends the ABC for being the home of Doctor Who in Australia for all of its record-breaking 50-year history. The ABC gave Whovians the chance to celebrate this important anniversary with a live global simulcast, a fast-tracked series, merchandise, events at ABC Shops, hand -pick ed classics on iview and the commemorative exhibition at the ABC Ultimo Centre. Whitlam: The Power and the Passion The ABC Advisory Council commends the ABC for the production of Whitlam: The Power and the Passion . The program was an informative and engaging account of the Whitlam government and serves as an important archive of Australian political history.

I. Regulatory Framework The ABC Board is required, under section 8(1)(e) of the ABC Act, to develop a code of practice relating to its television and radio programming, and to notify this code to the Australian Communications and Media Authority (\"the ACMA\"). A complaint alleging the ABC has acted contrary to its Code of Practice in its television or radio programming may be made to the ABC. A complainant is entitled under section 150 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (Cth) (\"the BSA\") to take their complaint to the ACMA if, after 60 days, the ABC fails to respond to the complainant or the complainant considers the ABC's response is inadequate. Section 150 of the BSA empowers the ACMA to investigate a complaint alleging the ABC has, in providing a national broadcasting service, breached its Code of Practice. The ACMA can decline to investigate the complaint under section 151 of the BSA if it is satisfied that the complaint does not relate to the ABC Code of Practice, or that the complaint is frivolous or vexatious or was not made in good faith. The ACMA's jurisdiction under sections 150-151 does not encompass the ABC's print content or content disseminated by the ABC over the internet or through mobile devices. However, the ACMA has separate jurisdiction under Schedule 7 of the BSA in relation to content hosted on websites or transmitted through mobile services where that content is either \"prohibited content\" 1 or \"age -restricted content\"2. The ACMA is empowered under Schedule 7 to require content service providers and content hosts to remove or prevent access to these types of content. The ABC voluntarily complies with the Content Services Code developed by the Internet Industry Association and registered as an industry code with the ACMA under clause 85 of Schedule 7 of the BSA. The Content Services Code does not apply to content delivered through online or mobile services where that content has been previously transmitted on radio or television. Except as expressly provided by the BSA, the regulatory regime established by the BSA does not apply to the ABC: section 13(5) of the BSA, and section 79 of the ABC Act.II. Scope of the Code The requirements of this Code are set out in the sections dealing with Interpretation and Standards in Part IV and the Associated Standard in Part V. The Standards in Part IV apply to radio and television programs broadcast by the ABC on its free-to-air television or radio broadcasting services. The Associated Standard in Part V applies only to television programs broadcast by the ABC on its domestic free-to-air television services. This Code does not apply to any complaint which the ABC had decided not to investigate or, having accepted it for investigation, decided not to investigate further, where the ABC was satisfied that: the complaint concerns content which is or becomes the subject of legal proceedings; the complaint was frivolous or vexatious or not made in good faith; the complaint was lodged with the ABC more than six weeks after the date when the program was last broadcast by the ABC on its free-to-air radio or television services, unless the ABC accepted the complaint for investigation after being satisfied that it was appropriate to do so, having regard to: -the interests of the complainant in the subject matter of the complaint; -the seriousness of the alleged breach; -the reason(s) for the delay; -the availability of the program content which is the subject of the complaint; and any prejudice the delay may otherwise have on the ABC's ability to investigate and determine the matter fairly; or 1. Prohibited content essentially involves content that is classified either as RC (Refused Classification) or X18+. This includes real depictions of actual sexual activity, child pornography, detailed instruction in crime, violence or drug use; and age-restricted content. 2. Age-restricted content involves content classified as R18+ or MA15+ that is delivered through a mobile device or through a service that provides audio or video content for a fee. This type of content must be subject to a restricted access system, i.e. measures put in place to protect children under the age of 15 from exposure to unsuitable material. This category of content includes material containing strong depictions of nudity, implied sexual activity, drug use or violence, very frequent or very strong coarse language, and other material that is strong in impact. Appendices 206 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Appendices 207 Appendix 5\u2014ABC Code of Practice continued Appendix 5\u2014ABC Code of Practice continued the complainant does not have a sufficient interest in the subject matter of the complaint, where the complaint alleges a breach of Fair and honest dealing (Standards 5.1-5.8) or Privacy (Standard 6. 1). To avoid any doubt, the ABC intends that any complaint falling within the terms of any one of the above categories is not relevant to the ABC Code of Practice, for the purposes of section 151(2)(b) of the BSA. In effect, this means that only complaints which the ABC has accepted for investigation in accordance with the above criteria are eligible under this Code to be reviewed and investigated by the ACMA. III. Resolved Complaints The ABC seeks to comply fully with the Code and to resolve complaints as soon as practicable. A failure to comply will not be a breach of the Code if the ABC has, prior to the complaint being made to the ACMA, taken steps which were adequate and appropriate in all the circumstances to redress the cause of the complaint. To illustrate, a failure to comply with Standards 2.1 or 2.2 (Accuracy) will not be taken to be a breach of the Code if a correction or clarification, which is adequate and appropriate in all the circumstances, is made prior to or within 30 days of the ABC receiving the complaint. IV. Principles and Standards 1. Interpretation In this Code, the Standards must be interpreted and applied in accordance with the Principles applying in each Section. From time to time, the ABC publishes Guidance Notes which do not in themselves impose obligations on the ABC, but which may be relevant in interpreting and applying the Code. The Standards in Parts IV and V are to be interpreted and applied with due regard for the nature of the content under consideration in particular cases. The ABC is conscious that its dual obligations\u2014 for accountability and for high quality\u2014can in practice interact in complex ways. It can be a sign of strength not weakness that journalism enrages or art shocks. The Standards are to be applied in ways that maintain independence and integrity, preserve trust and do not unduly constrain journalistic enquiry or artistic expression.2. Accuracy Principles: The ABC has a statutory duty to ensure that the gathering and presentation of news and information is accurate according to the recognised standards of objective journalism. Credibility depends heavily on factual accuracy. Types of fact-based content include news and analysis of current events, documentaries, factual dramas and lifestyle programs. The ABC requires that reasonable efforts must be made to ensure accuracy in all fact-based content. The ABC gauges those efforts by reference to: the type, subject and nature of the content; the likely audience expectations of the content; the likely impact of reliance by the audience on the accuracy of the content; and the circumstances in which the content was made and presented. The ABC accuracy standard applies to assertions of fact, not to expressions of opinion. An opinion, being a value judgement or conclusion, cannot be found to be accurate or inaccurate in the way facts can. The accuracy standard requires that opinions be conveyed accurately, in the sense that quotes should be accurate and any editing should not distort the meaning of the opinion expressed. The efforts reasonably required to ensure accuracy will depend on the circumstances. Sources with relevant expertise may be relied on more heavily than those without. Eyewitness testimony usually carries more weight than second-hand accounts. The passage of time or the inaccessibility of locations or sources can affect the standard of verification reasonably required. The ABC should make reasonable efforts, appropriate in the context, to signal to audiences gradations in accuracy, for example by querying interviewees, qualifying bald assertions, supplementing the partly right and correcting the plainly wrong. Standards: 2.1 Make reasonable efforts to ensure that material facts are accurate and presented in context. 2.2 Do not present factual content in a way that will materially mislead the audience. In some cases, this may require appropriate labels or other explanatory in formation.3. Corrections and clarifications Principles: A commitment to accuracy includes a willingness to correct errors and clarify ambiguous or otherwise misleading information. Swift correction can reduce harmful reliance on inaccurate information, especially given content can be quickly, widely and permanently disseminated. Corrections and clarifications can contribute to achieving fairness and impartiality. Standards: 3.1 Acknowledge and correct or clarify, in an appropriate manner as soon as reasonably pr acticable: a. significant material errors that are readily apparent or have been demonstrated; or b. information that is likely to significantly and materially mislead. 4. Impartiality and diversity of perspectives Principles: The ABC has a statutory duty to ensure that the gathering and presentation of news and information is impartial according to the recognised standards of objective journalism. Aiming to equip audiences to make up their own minds is consistent with the public service character of the ABC. A democratic society depends on diverse sources of reliable information and contending opinions. A broadcaster operating under statute with public funds is legitimately expected to contribute in ways that may differ from commercial media, which are free to be partial to private interests. Judgements about whether impartiality was achieved in any given circumstances can vary among individuals according to their personal and subjective view of any given matter of contention. Acknowledging this fact of life does not change the ABC's obligation to apply its impartiality standard as objectively as possible. In doing so, the ABC is guided by these hallmarks of impartiality: a balance that follows the weight of evidence; fair treatment; open-mindedness; and opportunities over time for principal relevant perspectives on matters of contention to be expressed.The ABC aims to present, over time, content that addresses a broad range of subjects from a diversity of perspectives reflecting a diversity of experiences, presented in a diversity of ways from a diversity of sources, including content created by ABC staff, generated by audiences and commissioned or acquired from external content-makers. Impartiality does not require that every perspective receives equal time, nor that every facet of every argument is presented. Assessing the impartiality due in given circumstances requires consideration in context of all relevant factors including: the type, subject and nature of the content; the circumstances in which the content is made and presented; the likely audience expectations of the content; the degree to which the matter to which the content relates is contentious; the range of principal relevant perspectives on the matter of contention; and the timeframe within which it would be appropriate for the ABC to provide opportunities for the principal relevant perspectives to be expressed, having regard to the public importance of the matter of contention and the extent to which it is the subject of current debate. Standards: 4.1 Gather and present news and information with due impartiality. 4.2 Present a diversity of perspectives so that, over time, no significant strand of thought or belief within the community is knowingly excluded or disproportionately represented. 4.3 Do not state or imply that any perspective is the editorial opinion of the ABC. The ABC takes no editorial stance other than its commitment to fundamental democratic principles including the rule of law, freedom of speech and religion, parliamentary democracy and equality of opportunity. 4.4 Do not misrepresent any perspective. 4.5 Do not unduly favour one perspective over another.Appendices 208 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Appendices 209 Appendix 5\u2014ABC Code of Practice continued Appendix 5\u2014ABC Code of Practice continued 5. Fair and honest dealing Principles: Fair and honest dealing is essential to maintaining trust with audiences and with those who participate in or are otherwise directly affected by ABC content. In rare circumstances, deception or a breach of an undertaking may be justified. Because of the potential damage to trust, deception or breach of an undertaking must be explained openly afterwards unless there are compelling reasons not to do so. Standards: Dealing with participants5.1 Participants in ABC content should normally be informed of the general nature of their participation. 5.2 A refusal to participate will not be overridden without good cause.Opportunity to respond 5.3 Where allegations are made about a person or organisation, make reasonable efforts in the circumstances to provide a fair opportunity to r espond. Attribution and sources 5.4 Aim to attribute information to its source. 5.5 Where a source seeks anonymity, do not agree without first considering the source's motive and any alternative attributable sources. 5.6 Do not misrepresent another's work as your o wn. Undertakings 5.7 Assurances given in relation to conditions of participation, use of content, confidentiality or anonymity must be honoured except in rare cases where justified in the public interest. Secret recording and other types of deception 5.8 Secret recording devices, misrepresentation or other types of deception must not be used to obtain or seek information, audio, pictures or an agreement to participate except where: a. justified in the public interest and the material cannot reasonably be obtained by any other means; or b. consent is obtained from the subject or identities are effectively obscured; or c. the deception is integral to an artistic work and the potential for harm is taken into consideration.6. P rivacy Principles: Privacy is necessary to human dignity and every person reasonably expects that their privacy will be respected. But privacy is not absolute. The ABC seeks to balance the public interest in respect for privacy with the public interest in disclosure of information and freedom of expression. Standards: 6.1 Intrusion into a person's private life without consent must be justified in the public interest and the extent of the intrusion must be limited to what is proportionate in the circumstances. 7. Harm and offence Principles: The ABC broadcasts comprehensive and innovative content that aims to inform, entertain and educate diverse audiences. Innovation involves a willingness to take risks, invent and experiment with new ideas. This can result in challenging content which may offend some of the audience some of the time. But it also contributes to diversity of content in the media and to fulfilling the ABC's function to encourage and promote the musical, dramatic and other performing arts. The ABC acknowledges that a public broadcaster should never gratuitously harm or offend and accordingly any content which is likely to harm or offend must have a clear editorial purpose. The ABC potentially reaches the whole community, so it must take into account community standards. The ABC must also be able to provide content for specific target audiences whose standards may differ from generally held community attitudes. Applying the harm and offence standard requires careful judgement. Context is an important consideration. What may be inappropriate and unacceptable in one context may be appropriate and acceptable in another. Coarse language, disturbing images or unconventional situations may form a legitimate part of reportage, debate, documentaries or a humorous, satirical, dramatic or other artistic work. Consideration of the nature of the target audience for particular content is part of assessing harm and offence in context, as is any signposting that equips audiences to make informed choices about what they see, hear or read.Standards: 7.1 Content that is likely to cause harm or offence must be justified by the editorial context. 7.2 Where content is likely to cause harm or offence, having regard to the context, make reasonable efforts to provide information about the nature of the content through the use of classification labels or other warnings or advice. 7.3 Ensure all domestic television programs\u2014with the exception of news, current affairs and sporting events\u2014are classified and scheduled for broadcast in accordance with the ABC's Associated Standard on Television Program Classification. 7.4 If inadvertent or unexpected actions, audio or images in live content are likely to cause harm or offence, take appropriate steps to mitigate. 7.5 The reporting or depiction of violence, tragedy or trauma must be handled with extreme sensitivity. Avoid causing undue distress to victims, witnesses or bereaved relatives. Be sensitive to significant cultural practices when depicting or reporting on recently deceased persons. 7.6 Where there is editorial justification for content which may lead to dangerous imitation or exacerbate serious threats to individual or public health, safety or welfare, take appropriate steps to mitigate those risks, particularly by taking care with how content is expressed or presented. 7.7 Avoid the unjustified use of stereotypes or discriminatory content that could reasonably be interpreted as condoning or encouraging prejudice. 8. Children and young people Principles: The ABC aims to provide children and young people (under the age of 18) with enjoyable and enriching content, as well as opportunities for them to express themselves. Children and young people participate and interact with the ABC in various ways\u2014as actors, presenters, interviewees, subjects, content makers and audience members. The ABC has a responsibility to protect children and young people from potential harm that might arise during their engagement with the ABC and its content. The ABC shares this responsibility with parents/guardians and with the child or young person him/herself. In particular, the ABC recommends that parents/guardians supervise children and young people's access to content, their participation in interactive services, and their exposure to news and current affairs. It is not always possible to avoid presenting content that may be distressing to some audience members. Standards: 8.1 Take due care over the dignity and physical and emotional welfare of children and young people who are involved in making, participating in and presenting content produced or commissioned by the ABC. 8.2 Before significant participation of a child or young person in content produced or commissioned by the ABC, or in interactive services offered by the ABC, consider whether it is appropriate to obtain the consent of both the child/young person and the parent/guardian. 8.3 Adopt appropriate measures wherever practicable to enable children and young people, or those who supervise them, to manage risks associated with the child/ young person's participation with, use of and exposure to ABC content and services designed for them. 8.4 Take particular care to minimise risks of exposure to unsuitable content or inappropriate contact by peers or strangers. V. A ssociated Standard: Television Program Classification Status of Associated Standard This Associated Standard is approved by the ABC Board and is binding. It is for consideration by relevant editorial decision-makers when providing advice on compliance and by complaints bodies when dealing with complaints. The Associated Standard is provided to assist interpretation of or otherwise supplement the standard in the Editorial Policies to which the Associated Standard relates. This Associated Standard forms part of the Code of Practice notified to the Australian Communications and Media Authority under section 8(1)(e) of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983. Key Editorial Standard 7.3 Ensure all domestic television programs\u2014with the exception of news, current affairs and sporting events\u2014are classified and scheduled for broadcast in accordance with the ABC's Associated Standard on Television Program Classification.Appendices 210 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Appendices 211 Appendix 5\u2014ABC Code of Practice continued Appendix 5\u2014ABC Code of Practice continued Principles: The ABC applies the classifications listed below to the broadcast of all its domestic television programs with the exception of news, current affairs and sporting events. The ABC classifications are adapted from the Guidelines for the Classification of Films and Computer Games issued by the Classification Board made under the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995 . The guiding principle in the application of the following classifications is context. What is inappropriate and unacceptable in one context may be appropriate and acceptable in another. Factors to be taken into account include: the artistic or educational merit of the production, the purpose of a sequence, the tone, the camera work, the intensity and relevance of the material, the treatment, and the intended audience. Standards: 7.3.1 Television Classifications G - GENERAL (G programs may be shown at any time) G programs, which include programs designed for pre-school and school-aged children, are suitable for children to watch on their own. Some G programs may be more appropriate for older children. The G classification does not necessarily indicate that the program is one that children will enjoy. Some G programs contain themes or storylines that are not of interest to children. Whether or not the program is intended for children, the treatment of themes and other classifiable elements will be careful and discreet. Themes: The treatment of themes should be discreet, justified by context, and very mild in impact. The presentation of dangerous, imitable behaviour is not permitted except in those circumstances where it is justified by context. Any depiction of such behaviour must not encourage dangerous imitation. Violence: Violence may be very discreetly implied, but should: have a light tone, or have a very low sense of threat or menace, and be infrequent, and not be gratuitous.Sex: Sexual activity should: only be suggested in very discreet visual or verbal references, and be infrequent, and not be gratuitous. Artistic or cultural depictions of nudity in a sexual context may be permitted if the treatment is discreet, justified by context, and very mild in impact. Language: Coarse language should: be very mild and infrequent, and not be gratuitous. Drug Use: The depiction of the use of legal drugs should be handled with care. Illegal drug use should be implied only very discreetly and be justified by context. Nudity: Nudity outside of a sexual context should be: infrequent, and not detailed, and not gratuitous. PG - PARENTAL GUIDANCE (Parental Guidance recommended for people under 15 years) Subject to the Implementation Guidelines at 7.3.2, PG programs may be shown in accordance with Time Zone Charts at 7.3.5. PG programs may contain themes and concepts which, when viewed by those under 15 years, may require the guidance of an adult. The PG classification signals to parents that material in this category contains depictions or references which could be confusing or upsetting to children without adult guidance. Material classified PG will not be harmful or disturbing to children. Parents may choose to preview the material for their children. Some may choose to watch the material with their children. Others might find it sufficient to be accessible during or after the viewing to discuss the content. Themes: The treatment of themes should be discreet and mild in impact. More disturbing themes are not generally dealt with at PG level. Supernatural or mild horror themes may be included.Violence: Violence may be discreetly implied or stylised and should also be: mild in impact, and not shown in detail. Sex: Sexual activity and nudity in a sexual context may be suggested, but should: be discreet, and be infrequent, and not be gratuitous. Verbal references to sexual activity should be discreet. Language: Coarse language should be mild and infrequent. Drug Use: Discreet verbal references and mild, incidental visuals of drug use may be included, but these should not promote or encourage drug use. Nudity: Nudity outside of a sexual context should not be detailed or gratuitous.M - MATURE (Recommended for people aged 15 years and over) Subject to the Implementation Guidelines at 7.3.2, M programs may be shown: on weekdays that are school days, between noon and 3.00 pm; and on any day of the week between 8.30 pm and 5.00 am. The M category is recommended for people aged over 15 years. Programs classified M contain material that is considered to be potentially harmful or disturbing to those under 15 years. Depictions and references to classifiable elements may contain detail. While most themes may be dealt with, the degree of explicitness and intensity of treatment will determine what can be accommodated in the M category\u2014the less explicit or less intense material will be included in the M classification and the more explicit or more intense material, especially violent material, will be included in the MA15+ classification. Themes: Most themes can be dealt with, but the treatment should be discreet and the impact should not be strong.Violence: Generally, depictions of violence should: not contain a lot of detail, and not be prolonged. In realistic treatments, depictions of violence that contain detail should: be infrequent, and not have a strong impact, and not be gratuitous. In stylised treatments, depictions of violence may contain more detail and be more frequent if this does not increase the impact. Verbal and visual references to sexual violence may only be included if they are: discreet and infrequent, and strongly justified by the narrative or documentary con text. Sex: Sexual activity may be discreetly implied. Nudity in a sexual context should not contain a lot of detail, or be prolonged. Verbal references to sexual activity may be more detailed than depictions if this does not increase the impact. Language: Coarse language may be used. Generally, coarse language that is stronger, detailed or very aggressive should: be infrequent, and not be gratuitous. Drug Use: Drug use may be discreetly shown. Drug use should not be promoted or encouraged. Nudity: Nudity outside of a sexual context may be shown but depictions that contain any detail should not be gratuitous. MA15+ - MATURE AUDIENCE (Not suitable for people under 15 years) MA15+ programs may be shown between 9.00 pm and 5.00 am on any day of the week. MA15+ programs, because of the matter they contain or because of the way it is treated, are not suitable for people aged under 15 years.Appendices 212 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Appendices 213 Appendix 5\u2014ABC Code of Practice continued Appendix 5\u2014ABC Code of Practice continued Material classified MA15+ deals with issues or contains depictions which require a more mature perspective. This is because the impact of individual elements or a combination of elements is considered likely to be harmful or disturbing to viewers under 15 years of age. While most themes may be dealt with, the degree of explicitness and intensity of treatment will determine what can be accommodated in the MA15+ category\u2014the more explicit or more intense material, especially violent material, will be included in the MA15+ classification and the less explicit or less intense material will be included in the M cla ssification. Themes: The treatment of themes with a high degree of intensity should not be gratuitous. Violence: Generally, depictions of violence should not have a high impact.In realistic treatments, detailed depictions of violence with a strong impact should: be infrequent, and not be prolonged, and not be gratuitous. Depictions of violence in stylised treatments may be more detailed and more frequent if this does not increase the impact. Depictions of sexual violence are permitted only if they are not frequent, prolonged, gratuitous or e xploitative. Sex: Sexual activity may be implied. Depictions of nudity in a sexual context which contain detail should not be exploitative. Verbal references may be more detailed than depictions, if this does not increase the impact. Language: Coarse language may be used. Coarse language that is very strong, aggressive or detailed should not be gratuitous. Drug Use: Drug use may be shown, but should not b e promoted or encouraged. More detailed depictions should not have a high degree of impact. Nudity: Nudity should be justified by context.7.3.2 Implementation Guidelines Application of classifications to specific channels: ABC4Kids\u2014G only programming all day (5.00 am to 7.00 pm) ABC3\u2014M programming will not apply between 12.00 pm and 3.00 pm. The time zones for each program classification are guides to the most likely placement of programs within that classification. They are not hard and fast rules and there will be occasions on which programs or segments of programs appear in other time zones. For example, a PG program or segment of a program designed for teenage viewers could appear between 4.00 pm and 6.00 pm on a week day if that is the time most suitable for the target audience. There must be sound reasons for any departure from the time zone for a program classification. Programs which are serious presentations of moral, social or cultural issues, may appear outside their normal classification time zone, provided that a clear indication of the nature of the content is given at the beginning of the program. Programs, including those having a particular classification under the Classification Board's Guidelines for the Classification of Films and Computer Games, may be modified so that they are s uitable for broadcast or suitable for broadcast at particular times. Broken Hill in New South Wales shares a time zone with South Australia and ordinarily receives the ABC's SA TV services. Given the time zone difference, in the rare cases when Broken Hill receives ABC NSW TV services, some programs may be broadcast outside their classification time zone. 7.3.3 Television Classification Symbols The classification symbol of the PG, M or MA15+ program (except for news, current affairs or sporting events) being shown will be displayed at the beginning of the program. The classification symbol of the PG, M or MA15+ program (except for news, current affairs or sporting events) being promoted will be displayed during the pr omotion. 7.3.4 Consumer Advice Audio and visual consumer advice on the reasons for an M or MA15+ classification will be given prior to the beginning of an M or MA15+ program.7.3.5 Time Zone chart ABC TV CLASSIFICATION TIME Public holidays and W eekendsAppendices 214 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Appendices 215 Appendix 6\u2014ABC Television, Content Analysis ABC1 program hours transmitted\u201424 hours July 2013 - June 2014 Australian Overseas Total First Release RepeatTotal AustralianFirst Release RepeatTotal Overseas 2013-14 2012-13 Arts and Culture 80 87 167 16 80 96 263 329 Children's 9 151 160 8 235 243 403 624 Current Affairs 521 266 788 0 0 0 788 788 Documentary 44 89 133 46 208 254 387 460 Drama 101 190 291 140 869 1 009 1 300 961 Entertainment 1 048 73 1 121 33 350 383 1 503 1 530 Factual 192 291 483 48 347 396 878 999 Indigenous 5 7 12 0 0 0 12 8 Movies 0 0 0 0 596 596 596 462 News 1 702 15 1 717 0 0 0 1 717 1 578 Religion and Ethics 18 30 48 11 27 38 86 94 Sport 198 333 531 0 0 0 531 613 Total Program Hours 3 919 1 531 5 449 302 2 712 3 014 8 464 8 447 % of Total Hours 5 745 3 014 8 760 8 760 % of Total Hours 66% 34% *Other: includes interstitial material, program announcements and community service announcements.
