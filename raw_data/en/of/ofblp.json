[Men play an equal role when it comes to dealing with infertility](https://www.mireproductivemedicine.com/what-we-do/infertility-treatments/infertility-in-men/). According to ASRM, the male partner being the sole cause or contributing cause of infertility is a factor for about 40% of infertile couples. Here are some sperm facts from our Medical Technologist, Chris Maksimovski: * The average ejaculate contains 200 million sperm. * The speed of a swimming sperm is about 1-4 mm per minute. * Sperm cells are constantly being produced and it takes about 2.5 months for completely new sperm cells to form (Spermatogenesis). This can mean a common cold, fever, or flu bug can impact sperm quality/quantity and take up to 90 days to fully recover. * Sperm cells are the smallest cells of the human body. Eggs cells (Oocytes) are the largest cells. * The optimal temperature for sperm production is 7 degrees cooler than the rest of the body. That is why the testes (where sperm is made) are housed inside the scrotum. * Factors such as poor diet, smoking, drinking, and a sedentary lifestyle can negatively impact sperm quantity and quality. * Sitting in a hot tub, using a laptop directly on your lap, or even having your smartphone in your front pocket can negatively impact sperm quality. That is because it causes a rise in temperature near the scrotal region.
