I know that you have many excellent programs across the country to choose from. We are grateful that chose to learn more about Boston Medical Center. We are proud of the training experience we provide our residents and the exceptional care we deliver to our patients. Both of these imperatives are tightly coupled and central to the strategy of our health-system pharmacy department. Each year, our residents' longitudinal quality improvement projects align with our departmental goals and represent the foundation of one of our three strategic pillars - \"Drive continued top-line growth, optimize cost of goods sold, and deliver quality improvement for our hospital pharmacies\". Our department's vision is to \"become the national leader of integrated delivery network (IDN)-based pharmacies, committed to the highest quality patient care, community engagement, and innovation\". One of the ways we strive to achieve this vision is by strengthening our influence at the health-system by solving vexing problems for Boston Medical Center. This past year, we were called upon to improve prescribing for oral COVID-19 therapies. We implemented a system-wide approach that involved our community, ambulatory, oncology, resident, and emergency medicine teams. Our ambulatory care team, working under a collaborative scope of practice agreement, was able to increase prescribing by 250%. Lastly, we deployed some of our residents to the ED to screen patients and prescribe them oral COVID-19 therapies at discharge under another collaborative scope of practice agreement. Our residency program continues to grow proportionally to the value we provide our patients and the organization. This year, we added a Health-System Pharmacy Administration and Leadership (HSPAL) program. This program builds upon our department's efforts to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in our workplace and profession. Its goal is to train and develop racially and ethnically minoritized pharmacy leaders and completes the pipeline that we started with our All-In Scholarship program for minoritized students (https://www.bmc.org/medical-professionals/pharmacy-residency/all-committee). Good luck with your residency program search. I hope to see you next year at Boston Medical Center! Sincerely, Kevin J. Horbowicz, PharmD, BCPS Associate Chief Pharmacy Officer, Inpatient 3Boston Medical Center ANNUAL REPORT 20214 Boston Medical Center ANNUAL REPORT 2022Pharmacy Residency Program in Health- System Pharmacy Administration & Leadership (HSPAL) This inaugural program, set to begin July 2022, will expose pharmacy residents to a solid clinical experience their first year, followed by a second year of a heavy concentration with pharmacy operations and health-system system administrative leadership teams. Learning from some of the best programs in the region, residents will develop relevant clinical pharmacy competencies and work on pharmacy and health-system corporate/business strategy initiatives. The expectation is that residents who complete this program will be formidable candidates for consideration in not only pharmaceutical leadership roles, but also leadership roles across the health care spectrum if they decide to go in that direction. During the two-year program, residents will graduate having gained vast leadership experience while also earning their MBA degree in Health Care Administration from Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University's (FAMU) online program, a historically Black University (HBCU). \"The clinical and leadership exposure from arguably some of the best minds in New England, makes this a highly sought after program on its own. Adding in the intentionality of seeking a diverse pool of candidates, excites and humbles me as its Program Director. \" HSPAL RESIDENCY SPOTLIGHT Sebastian Hamilton, PharmD, MBA, RPh Associate Chief Pharmacy Officer, Outpatient Pharmacy Services, PGY1/2 HSPAL Residency Program Director Associate Chief Pharmacy Officer, Outpatient Pharmacy Services.5 Boston Medical Center ANNUAL REPORT 2022ASHP BEST PRACTICE AWARD Development and Implementation of Emergency Department Pharmacist-Driven Opioid Use Disorder Treatment Initiatives ASHP Best Practices Award is an annual recognition program since 1999 which recognizes outstanding practitioners in pharmacy who have successfully implemented innovative systems. Between April 2018 and July 2021, a quality improvement work group aimed to improve the treatment of patients with opioid use disorder presenting to the ED through provision of harm reduction services and initiation of medications for opioid use disorder (OUD). This QI initiative improved patient access to OUD treatment and naloxone in addition to increasing follow- up at our substance use disorder (SUD) bridge clinic. Natalija M. Farrell, Pharm.D., BCPS, DABAT; Jessica L. I; Jessica Kehoe, Pharm.D., M.B.A.; Lauren M. Nentwich, M.D. Administration of medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) in the ED increased from a baseline of 38 to 98 administrations/month in starting in September 2018 to a new sustained mean of 199.9 administrations/month since January 2019. No patients received rescue naloxone following MOUD administration. No patients discharged from the ED after receiving MOUD returned to the ED within 24 hours for an opioid overdose. Buprenorphine-naloxone discharge prescribing increased from a mean of 0 to 2.3 prescriptions/month starting in September 2018, which further increased to a new average of 8 prescriptions/month beginning in January 2019. ED pharmacist-led buprenorphine-naloxone transitions of care bundle resulted in significantly greater follow-up at the SUD bridge clinic within 7 days (76.7% 42.7%, p<0.001) and naloxone when compared to traditional buprenorphine-naloxone discharge prescriptions. A significant shift change leading to a reduction in ED visits for OUD was observed starting in November 2020. Naloxone take home kit dispenses increased annually and reached a new high of 397. This initiative goes a long way to show that pharmacists are essential to successful implemen - tation of ED-based MOUD and naloxone programs. This award highlights the accomplish - ments and strong work in developing innovative strategies to reducing barriers to treatment and facilitating linkage to outpatient care!6 Boston Medical Center ANNUAL REPORT 2022Megan Seraphin, Pharm.D, BCOP earned her Doctor of Pharmacy degree from Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts in 2016. She completed her PGY-1 Pharmacy Practice residency at Boston Medical Center in 2017. Afterwards, she worked as a clinical pharmacist in hematology/ oncology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston for three years. Now she is currently practicing as a Clinical Pharmacy Specialist for the hematological malignancies service at Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington, DC. WHAT SPARKED YOUR INTEREST AND ULTIMATELY LED YOU TO PURSUE RESIDENCY HERE AT BMC? I think the initial spark that led to me looking into BMC was hearing about the great experiences some of my classmates were having there during their APPE rotations. They raved about the dynamic preceptor group and how much they were able to see in their short time there. I remember thinking if they were so impressed in how much they saw in only six weeks, imagine what their residents see in a year. Seeing their extensive list of rotation offerings also made me confident that their program would give me the opportunity to explore many of my areas of interest. As I researched more into BMC, I found that its mission and values really resonated with me, and I knew that it would be a different, and more fulfilling experience than anything I had done before.WHAT ARE SOME SKILLS THAT YOU EITHER DEVELOPED OR IMPROVED ON DURING YOUR RESIDENCY THAT CONTRIBUTED TO YOUR SUCCESS, EITHER EARLY ON OR EVEN IN YOUR CURRENT CAREER? The most important thing BMC taught me clinically was the ability to quickly triage situations. I ended up having rotations in both the MICU and emergency department during my residency year. Although these specialties were not my calling, my time in the ED trauma rooms and ICU preparing medications during codes definitely taught me to function in high-pressure environments and to anticipate the needs of my team. The pages I received while on-call forced me to assess situations in real time and sift through the information I had available to develop a plan. Professionally, the most important lesson BMC instilled in me was the importance of closing the loop of communication. My co-residents and I joked that we never went a day without hearing the phrase \"close the loop,\" but we soon saw the value in it. To this day, this lesson continues to drive how I provide handoff with my teammates in my department and how I communicate with other members of our multidisciplinary service.QUESTION & ANSWER ALUMNI SPOTLIGHT DR. MEGAN SERAPHIN7 Boston Medical Center ANNUAL REPORT 2022Megan Seraphin, Pharm.D, BCOP earned her Doctor of Pharmacy degree from Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts in 2016. She completed her PGY-1 Pharmacy Practice residency at Boston Medical Center in 2017.

Now she is currently practicing as a Clinical Pharmacy Specialist for the hematological malignancies service at Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington, DC.WERE THERE ANY UNIQUE EXPERIENCES OR MEMORIES AT BMC THAT STAND OUT TO YOU THINKING BACK? There are so many memorable experiences from my residency year, but I would have to say the consistent feeling of being fully embedded in the patient care team, regardless of the rotation I was on. One thing the BMC preceptors did really well was letting us establish ourselves as the pharmacist of the team, while still monitoring and being fully available from the background. I could also see immediately that the providers at BMC not only welcomed, but expected pharmacy's presence and participation. As residents, we were their first-line resource and it was rewarding to have my recommendations taken seriously. WHAT ADVICE DO YOU HAVE FOR INCOMING GRADUATES ON HOW TO BE A SUCCESSFUL RESIDENT? My number one piece of advice would be to keep all lines of communication open with the people around you. Residency, regardless of where you go, is not a walk in the park and it will challenge you in many ways. Your preceptors will not know what you want out of the experience or what you're struggling with unless you tell them. When it comes to your co-residents, learn from each other's successes and mistakes. I can't imagine navigating that year without the support and guidance from those who were going through it with me. Lastly, maintain your relationships with your friends and family. Although it may feel like no one outside of pharmacy understands the residency experience, these relationships are just as important and can provide much needed stress relief.WHAT KEEPS YOU MOTIVATED AND INTERESTED IN YOUR PRACTICE ON A DAY-TO-DAY BASIS? The specialty I have chosen to go into and the patients I care for keep me motivated. My job involves participating in the care of my patients on both the inpatient and outpatient side, so I often find myself getting to know patients and their caregivers quite well. It is a pleasure to serve as an additional resource to them and I am happy to contribute and advocate in any way that I can to ease their experience. WHEN YOU AREN'T WORKING, WHAT DO YOU DO TO RELAX? I'm still relatively new to the DC area, so most recently I've enjoyed exploring the city. Between all the monuments and museums, I'm on a mission to cross them all off my to-do list! 8 Boston Medical Center ANNUAL REPORT 2022Background: Coronovirus-19 (COVID-19) is a respiratory illness caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and was first discovered in Wuhan, China in December 2019. It rapidly spread across the globe and in January 2020, the first United States case was confirmed. Since then, COVID-19 vaccines and therapies have become available to improve patient care and outcomes. As a result of the increasing number of available COVID-19 therapies along with a surge in COVID-19 cases, our pharmacy department at Boston Medical Center (BMC) recognized the need to implement a novel multidisciplinary system to ensure adequate access, support safe and appropriate prescribing, dispensing, and monitoring practices and provide education involving use of these advancing therapies. The Role of Pharmacy Leadership: In early January 2022, the Omicron variant of COVID-19 caused a sudden surge in case numbers and hospitalizations across the nation. Pfizer's oral nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (PaxlovidTM), Merck's oral molnupiravir, and FDA emergency use authorization (EUA). EUA allows for use of unapproved medications or medical products during emergency situations to diagnose, treat, or prevent a life-threatening diseases. Drug supply limitations resulted in the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH) allocating a supply of these medications to our institution to be used for prescribing in the outpatient clinics and emergency department (ED). Pharmacy leadership recognized the organizational challenges of: limited supply, increasing demand, complexity of the therapeutic regimens and lack of prescriber experience. There was also a need to coordinate with pharmacy services due to the narrow time window in which these medications are effective. To overcome these challenges, a pharmacist-driven workflow was proposed that prioritized patients at highest risk of COVID-19-related health decline. The assessment and prescribing of COVID-19 therapies was driven solely by clinical pharmacists with the goal of transitioning the process to be provider-driven. The leadership team rapidly brought together inpatient, outpatient, ambulatory, and residency pharmacy teams to increase patient assessments, prescribing, and meet the unique needs of our patient population The Role of Ambulatory Care Clinical Pharmacy Specialist (CPS) Pharmacists To meet the demand of the COVID-19 surge, ambulatory care CPS expanded their scope of practice to encompass COVID-19 therapeutics under an infectious diseases (ID) physician. Alongside other advanced practice providers, they would respond to COVID-positive test COVID-19 THERAPY PILOT:9 Boston Medical Center ANNUAL REPORT 2022COVID-19 THERAPY PILOT: results by contacting patients, assessing symptoms, and eligibility for outpatient treatment. If eligible, the pharmacist would order appropriate oral antiviral therapy or coordinate an on-sight infusion for a monoclonal antibody. Under the scope of practice, ambulatory care CPS would provide additional supportive care and triage high acuity care to urgent/emergency care. The Role of Emergency Department (ED) Pharmacists During the Omicron surge, our ED was at capacity with limited resources. This resulted in lower than anticipated outpatient COVID-19 therapy assessment and prescribing relative to confirmed cases. We deployed an ED pilot utilizing two PGY1 pharmacy residents under a scope of practice (similar to ambulatory care CPS) with an ID physician to assess and order COVID-19 therapies. Patients confirmed COVID-19 positive in the ED were screened for treatment eligibility by the pilot pharmacists. Similar to the ambulatory CPS process, the ED pilot pharmacists ordered appropriate therapy, provided counseling, and coordinated timely access to therapies with the pharmacy. Our pharmacy team arranged for home delivery of medications, transportation to infusion clinics, and provided language-specific medication counseling sheets to overcome these obstacles. The Role of Outpatient Pharmacists (OPs) OPs played an integral role in access to medications and ensuring patient safety. OPs utilized electronic medical records, prescription insurance claim information, and the patient for medication reconciliation and to identify and manage drug-drug interactions with providers. COVID-19 therapies prescribed during ED pilot hours were delivered by inpatient medication- to-bedside delivery to the ED or by same-day courier service to the patient's preferred location. OPs called patients within four hours of drug receipt to counsel on medication adherence, potential adverse effects, and when to hold and resume home medications if necessary. OPs also counseled patients on continued self-isolation and steps to take if symptoms became worse. In summary, a multidisciplinary approach to the constantly evolving COVID-19 therapy landscape allowed for rapid development and implementation of a clinical assessment tool and medication dispensing process. The utilization of pharmacists across all areas of the institution increased the ability to provide adequate and appropriate COVID-19-related care and improved overall patient care during a time of need.10 Boston Medical Center ANNUAL REPORT 2022 The December REST event took place on a rainy Saturday night at Zoolights at the Stone Zoo. We enjoyed walking through the zoo, seeing all the lights and animal themed lantern displays, and animals; we even got to see one of Santa's reindeer!BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER RESIDENT EMOTIONAL SUPPORT TEAM (REST) ANNUAL REPORT 2021-2022 SEPTEMBER 2021: Residency Retreat OCTOBER 2021: Connor's Farm corn maze and Pharmacy weekDECEMBER 2021: Zoolights at Stone Zoo We started off our first REST event of the year with our annual residency retreat.
