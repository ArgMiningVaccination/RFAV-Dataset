These actions will support fairer assessment of all applicants, recognition of internationally educated psychologists and registration practices that are consistent with the FRPA. Several aspects of the NSBEP's registration practices are commendable. The Board has developed a web-based application system for applicants to submit their application and required documentation online, and is responsive to the need for continuous improvement of its website. On the recommendation of the FRPA Review Officer, NSBEP's staff has created clear, visual pathways to registration for each of the four scenarios outlined on the Board's website, including: psychologists registered in Canada; psychologists licensed in the US; international applicants; and applicants who are not fully registered elsewhere. The last option includes entry-level applicants and those who do not currently hold full registration as a psychologist in another jurisdiction. The NSBEP also provides applicants options for meeting academic requirements; applicants who are missing foundational knowledge coursework can complete the required coursework within a specified period, post candidate registration. The Board has also published all the fees associated with the application and registration process on its website. Considering the NSBEP's commitment to continuous improvement of registration practices, I expect NSBEP to address the following recommendations that have resulted from the FRPA review process: o provide additional information to applicants regarding the justification for, and outcomes of, the transfer interview / oral examination requirement for each pool of applicants; o develop a formal policy around the internal review process and make it available to applicants on the NSBEP website; o create and document internal processes around requests for documentation related to the registration process; o develop and document internal processes for acceptance of alternative information when original documentation cannot be obtained; o make information regarding acceptance of alternative documentation available to applicants on NSBEP's website; o establish and document formal language requirements; o develop a training plan for decision-makers; and o develop a policy on the placement and removal of conditions on registration. We appreciate the NSBEP's cooperation during the conduct of the registration review. Sincerely, Cara Spittal Review Officer, Fair Registration Practices Act Nova Scotia Board of Examiners in Psychology Page 3 FRPA Review Report Introduction The purpose of the Fair Registration Practices Act (FRPA) review is to share the Review Officer's understanding of progress made by the NSBEP regarding the fair consideration of individuals applying for registration.1 During the FRPA review process, a regulatory body's registration practices are measured against both the specific and general duties outlined in the Fair Registration Practices Code\u2014all of which encompass the overarching principles of transparency, objectivity, impartiality and procedural fairness.2 The analysis is based on the FRPA Review Officer's review work with the NSBEP to date. The Nova Scotia Board of Examiners in Psychology 2017 Review captures the results of the FRPA review process and includes an inventory of exemplary licensing practices and an Action Plan that holds the NSBEP accountable for continuous improvement within two years of the review. Through the 2017 FRPA Review, the FRPA Review Officer aims to build on the progress made by the NSBEP to date and identify opportunities to further improve and evolve registration practices. 1 For more information on the FRPA review process, see the Guide to Fair Registration Practices Act: http://novascotia.ca/lae/RplLabourMobility/documents/FRPA_GuidetoReviewProcess_WEB.pdf 2 The Fair Registration Practices Code is delineated in Sections 6-12 of the Fair Registration Practices Act. Government of Nova Scotia. Ch. 38 of the Acts of 2008, as amended by 2014, c. 14. Nova Scotia Board of Examiners in Psychology Page 4 FRPA Review Report Context of the Profession in Nova Scotia Nova Scotia Board of Examiners in Psychology The Nova Scotia Board of Examiners in Psychology (NSBEP) was created as a result of the Psychologists Act (1980). The Psychologists Act was introduced into the Nova Scotia House of Assembly on March 3, 1980, proclaimed into law on December 18, 1980, and amended in 2000. The Organization NSBEP is charged with protecting the public by regulating the practice of psychology in Nova Scotia. This involves setting registration requirements and professional standards and investigating complaints against Psychologists. The Psychologists Act also enables the Board to prosecute anyone holding himself/herself out as a provider of psychological services who is not authorized to do so. Regular Registration Requirements To become registered as a psychologist in Nova Scotia, applicants must meet the entry-to-practice standards of the profession, as established by the NSBEP. These include at least the following: o a doctoral or master's degree in psychology that is acceptable to the Board from an educational institution that is approved by the Board (see the NSBEP website for the criteria for acceptable degrees in psychology, o two years of supervised experience, in the case of a doctoral degree or four years, in the case of a master's degree, and o passage of a standardized, written and oral examinations. Transfer applications under the AIT x Applicants who are fully3 registered in another Canadian jurisdiction may become registered in Nova Scotia, as required by Chapter Seven of the Agreement on Internal Trade (AIT). x Applicants who are approved for a transfer of registration must attend a Transfer Interview with the Board. x Transfer applications are reviewed at the Board's monthly meeting and the Transfer Interview is typically scheduled on the date of the next monthly meeting (pending Board/applicant availability). 3 Fully registered as a psychologist in Canada refers to a psychologist holding a current registration certificate in a Canadian province or territory which is a signatory to Chapter 7 of the Canadian Free Trade Agreement, and the certificate authorizes the use of the title of Psychologist or Psychological Associate and allows autonomous practice of psychology in said jurisdiction. For greater clarity, fully registered does not refer to an individual who: x possesses registration in a country outside of Canada, x possesses registration with a psychology regulatory body that constitutes a provisional type of registration, x possesses registration as a psychologist but in a category that does not represent full registration, e.g. retired registration, non-practising registration, etc, or x possesses registration in another jurisdiction but not with a psychology regulatory body, e.g., counselling, marriage and family therapy, etc. Nova Scotia Board of Examiners in Psychology Page 5 FRPA Review Report International Applicants x The Act includes a provision that enables the Board to consider an international applicant as a Transfer Application where an applicant holds a certificate of registration as a psychologist from another country the standards of which are deemed by the Board to be at least equivalent to the standards required under the Act. x If the registration standards of the country are not deemed to be equivalent, the application will be considered using the regular NSBEP registration requirements. Organizational Structure and Staffing x The Board is comprised of five psychologist Board Members, who are appointed by the Association of Psychologists of Nova Scotia, and two Public Members who are appointed by government. x The Board elects a Chair, Vice-Chair, and Treasurer from among these members. x Board staff includes an Administrative Assistant (part-time), a Registrar (part-time) and an Assistant Registrar (full-time). Registration Categories (numbers as of 2017) x Registrants who are completing supervision and examination requirements are placed on the Candidate Register (82). x Registrants with full active registration are placed on the Register of Psychologists (480). x Registrants whose work involves university teaching and formal research are placed on the Academic Register (no applied practice allowed) (10). x Registrants who reside outside of Nova Scotia and who are registered with the regulatory body of that jurisdiction are placed on the Out-of-Province Register (no practice allowed in Nova Scotia)4 (10). x Registrants who are no longer practicing may withdraw from the Register or be placed the Retired Register (no practice allowed) (29). The Practice of Psychology in Nova Scotia There are currently 572 active registrants with NSBEP (2017). x 456 (79.7%) are working full-time x 96 (16.8%) are working part-time x 20 (3.5%) report that they are not currently working For those working part-time, the median number of hours worked per week is 20. Psychologists frequently practice in more than one setting. Consequently, the numbers provided here do not sum to the totals provided above. 4 This category is for psychologists who are not currently practicing in Nova Scotia and are currently registered and practicing in another jurisdiction. This category allows psychologists to remain a part of the NSBEP and transfer back to practicing in Nova Scotia quickly and easily, but without needing to pay the full annual fee that they would pay if they stayed on the Register of Psychologists. Nova Scotia Board of Examiners in Psychology Page 6 FRPA Review Report x 334 (58.4%) psychologists report that at least part of their work is in private practice x 179 (31.3%) report that at least part of their practice occurs in a hospital setting x 99 (17.3%) report that at least part of their work occurs in a school setting x 93 (16.3%) indicate that at least part of their work occurs in a university or college setting x 34 (6%) indicate that at least a part of their practice occurs in a government setting x 36 (6.6%) report that at least part of their work occurs in a Community Agency x 24 (4.2%) report that at least a part of their practice occurs in a Counselling Centre In describing their practice, some psychologists indicate that their work includes more than one area of practice. Again, the numbers provided here do not sum to the totals provided above. x 373 (65.2%) registrants describe their practice as being in the area of Clinical Psychology x 144 (25.2%) indicate that they work in the area of School Psychology x 116 (20.3%) report that at least part of their practice is in the area of Formal Research x 105 (18.4%) report that they work in the area of Counselling Psychology x 82 (14.3%) indicate that they work in the Academic area x 83 (14.5%) registrants indicate that their practice involves the area of Administration x 25 (4.4%) report that they work in the area of Clinical Neuropsychology, and x 17 (3%) indicate that they work in the area of Industrial /Organizational Psychology Psychologists in Nova Scotia provide services to people from a variety of age groups. x The majority of psychologists report that their practice includes work with adults (78.8%) x Fewer describe their practice as involving work with adolescents (70.8%) or children (55.2%) x Fewer still indicate that at least part of their practice includes work with infants (9.2%) or the elderly (22.4%) Psychologists do not only work with individuals. x Many report that their practice, in part, involves working with couples (24.3%) or families (44.2%) x Somewhat fewer indicate that a portion of their practice includes working with organizations (23.2%) Overview of Registration Process Registration Information All information on the registration requirements and the steps of applying for registration can be accessed on the \"Applicants\" Section of the Board's website: www.nsbep.org Applicants fall into 1 of 4 categories: 1) those who possess full registration as a psychologist in Canada 2) those who possess full registration as a psychologist in the US 3) international applicants, e.g., received their training in a country outside of Canada or the US 4) in all other circumstances, in which case they are considered a regular applicant (entry level) Nova Scotia Board of Examiners in Psychology Page 7 FRPA Review Report Registration Process x All steps of the registration process are numbered x As a first step, applicants are encouraged to perform a self-assessment of their credentials x The applicant completes the online application process and files all application materials x The Board completes an assessment of the completed application materials x The Board informs the applicant of the decision on his/her completed application x If the application can be considered as a transfer applicant, they would complete the transfer interview x Alternatively, if the applicant's academic credentials are approved, but the Board determines that the individual has not met the other criteria for transfer noted on the website, the Board may approve the applicant's name for placement on the Register of Candidates x Payment of the registration fee and issuance of registration Cost of Registration (including payment methods) Application for Registration: $250 Oral Exam / Transfer Interview: $500 Subtotal: $750 Annual Registration Fees: due only at time of registration: For detailed breakdown of Annual Registration Fees, please click here Total: ranges between $817 to $1555, depending on time of year when registration is started Courtesy Register*: $200 *For a period greater than 21 days but not exceeding 40 days of practice (free for 21 days or less) Other Fees: x Criminal Record Check** x Credential Evaluation by WES or CES (for credentials acquired outside Canada or the United States) ** x Other fees charged by third parties for documents such as Transcripts, Letters, Confirmation of Registration (if applicable) ** x **These amounts are not paid to NSBEP, but they are listed here, since they are a required part of the Application for Registration 2016 Registration Data Length of time (from receipt of completed application) registration usually takes is 30 days for domestic, Canadian applicants, and international applicants.

The NSBEP is committed to ensuring that applicants have access to registration practices that are transparent, objective, impartial and procedurally fair. During the FRPA review process, progressive steps that the NSBEP has taken to improve registration practices were brought to light, including: 9 NSBEP enables qualified psychologists with international credentials to obtain full registration without further examinations where they meet the requirements set by the Board for \"transfer applicants\"\u2014i.e. applicants transferring from another Canadian jurisdiction. This information is noted in the international applicants' section. 9 The Board provides an online application system for applicants to submit their application and materials online. The NSBEP also provides an online renewal system used for annual renewal of fees and updating of registration information at renewal and throughout the year. This online system allows applicants and registrants to conveniently pay any fees online. 9 If an applicant is missing foundational knowledge coursework, the Board provides the applicant with the ability to complete the coursework within a specified period, post candidate registration. 9 On the recommendation of the FRPA Review Officer, NSBEP staff worked very hard to quickly amend all sections of the Board's website pertaining to registration pathways in accordance with current website design best practices. Clear pathways to registration for each scenario have now been provided on the Board's website. There are currently four pathways that cover all possible scenarios: psychologists registered in Canada; psychologists licensed in the US; international applicants, applicants who are not fully registered elsewhere. This last option would include entry-level applicants and those who do not currently hold full registration as a psychologist in another jurisdiction. Each category of applicant can find all the information they require in the section that specifically relates to their category of application. Visual Pathway documents were also created for each of the four pathways. 9 On the recommendation of the FRPA Review Officer, NSBEP Staff has ensured that the information related to transfer interview process is accessible to applicants and that the possible outcomes of each application pathway are articulated clearly on the website. 9 On the recommendation of the FRPA Review Officer, a listing of all fees related to the application and registration process was created and made available on the NSBEP website. 9 Like other regulators, NSBEP imposes a deadline for submission of application materials for review by the Board. However, staff work hard with applicants, even when materials are provided beyond the two-week deadline, to assist them with getting the outstanding documents submitted to the Board. Moreover, to ensure that the review at the Board meeting goes as smoothly as possible, staff complete a thorough review of the application in advance of the Board meeting and alert applicants to items that may need to be clarified for the Board. Within one week of the Board meeting, applicants are notified by email with the results of the application review. Nova Scotia Board of Examiners in Psychology Page 10 FRPA Review Report 9 Courtesy Register - NSBEP extends temporary registration to colleagues from other jurisdictions as a courtesy. Psychologists registered and in good standing in other jurisdictions may apply for temporary registration in Nova Scotia. 9 Out-of-Province Register - This category is for psychologists who are not currently practicing in Nova Scotia and are currently registered and practicing in another jurisdiction. This category allows psychologists to remain a part of the NSBEP and transfer back to practicing in Nova Scotia quickly and easily, but without needing to pay the full annual fee that they would pay if they stayed on the Register of Psychologists. 9 The Nova Scotia Board of Examiners in Psychology through its participation in the Association of Canadian Psychology Regulatory Organizations (ACPRO), supports the proposal to ESDC for funding to establish a single point of entry for validation and some assessment of qualifications of foreign trained psychologists seeking entry into the profession in Canada. As the regulator of psychologists in Nova Scotia, we recognize the benefit of having a single point of entry across national jurisdictions to allow for greater consistency, transparency and fairness for international trained applicants. Should this project be completed as planned, the Nova Scotia Board of Examiners in Psychology would seek to make this service the sole point of entry for the registration process for foreign trained psychologists. Nova Scotia Board of Examiners in Psychology Page 11 FRPA Review Report Fair-access Analysis Overall, the NSBEP's registration practices comply with the Fair Registration Practices Code as outlined in Sections 6 to 12 of the Act (FRPA). Per Section 16 of the Act, the registration practices of a regulating body must be reviewed and a public report produced. The FRPA Review Office works with regulatory bodies to assess their registration practices against the Fair-Access Guidelines listed below, and develop an Action Plan to help each body improve their practices and comply with the act. The NSBEP's responses to the FRPA Review Survey are detailed below, along with the Review Finding determined by the Review Officer in accordance with the Act (Fair-access Guidelines).

Applicants with enquiries would receive a response within 48 hours during normal workdays, and sometimes much more quickly than 48 hours. Confirmation of receipt of the enquiry is often sent well before the 48 hours has elapsed. NSBEP's auto -reply email states as follows: \"Thank you for contacting the Nova Scotia Board of Examiners in Psychol ogy (NSBEP). This notification will confirm receipt of your email. Due to the large volume of emails received daily by the main NSBEP email account, there may be a delay in answering your query.

Yes If transcripts cannot be sent directly from institution, then we will accept notarized copies. If the institution can verify the information we have received from the applicant, then we have had cases where we accept this information, if verified by the institution, e.g. course syllabi or other programmatic information. We understand that some regulators have encountered circumstances where it is not practical for the applicant to obtain official documentation. This has not been an issue identified through our experience with prospective registrants or applicants, other than as noted above, which is covered by the policy involving notarization. However, if this were ever identified as an issue, it would be addressed with the individual. Our registration requirements are Level 1 Yes - on a case by case basis Level 2 Yes - examples documented Process not clearly laid out or documented Level 3 Yes - process clearly documented Level 2 9(b), 16(3)(c) Nova Scotia Board of Examiners in Psychology Page 24 FRPA Review Report transparent, and there may be some prospective registrants who see that their qualifications do not meet the requirements of ou r legislation. However, we do not believe that any individual has chosen not to pursue registration with NSBEP based on an inability to obtain adequate educational documentation. We would be willing to include a statement in the PDF that describes our supporting documentation requirements to clarify that if an individual believes they meet all requirements for registration, but are unable to produce educational documentation, that they may contact us for direction on alternative documentation. However, at this time, we do not believe there are any circumstances warranting a revision to the existing policy. 17 What difficulties or obstacles are faced by applicants who received their qualifications in a country other than Canada? Timeliness of WES or CES to complete the review. It can take considerable time to provide these assessments given the documentation and verification of documentation process that is required for a proper evaluation. It could be that additional staff persons could be helpful with CES timeframes. Alternatively, our understanding is that some ot her provinces have their own evaluation services which can provide efficient service for academic equivalency evaluation. This could be an undertaking for governments in the Atlantic provinces to consider. N/A N/A 6, 9(b), 16(3)(c) 18a Do you have a process for which requests for access documentatio n related to registrations are considered? Draft Policy: The applicant can request a copy of their submitted application materials. This would include a letter outlining the Board's reasons for its decision on the application. This would exclude minutes of meetings and copies of references that are provided to the Board as part of the application process under the possible expectation of confidentiality. An electronic copy of the application material s can be provided by email at no charge. A hard copy can be mailed to an applicant for a minimum charge of $20. However, depending on the volume of documentation, an additional surcharge may apply. Level 1 Not documented Level 2 Documented Level 3 Documented and made available to applicants Level 2 12, 16(3)(j) Nova Scotia Board of Examiners in Psychology Page 25 FRPA Review Report The original application materials remain the property of the Board. The Board may return the original copy of the criminal record check and/or child abuse check, once the original has been viewed by Board staff. 18b Is this made available to applicants? No See 18a 18c Do you charge a fee? No 19 Does your Act include an authority to conduct an internal review of the registration decision? No. The Psychologists Act predates the Fair Registration Practices Act. Nevertheless, we have an Internal Review Process that is offered to every unsuccessful applicant. Level 1 N/A Level 2 N/A Level 3 Yes N/A 7(a) 20 Do you have a regulation or by-law that defines the internal review process? This is required by Board Policy and stated in each application pathway on the Board's website. Level 1 N/A Level 2 N/A Level 3 Yes N/A 7(a), 10 21 When are unsuccessful candidates informed of their right to internal review of the registration decision? When the applicant is notified that the Board has not approved their application, they are advised of the opportunity to request the Internal Review Process. Level 1 No specific timeline Level 2 Specific timeline Not documented Level 3 Specific timeline Documented and communicated Level 3 7(a), 10(1) 22a Do you have an internal review process Yes Level 1 Yes Level 2 7(a), 10(1) Nova Scotia Board of Examiners in Psychology Page 26 FRPA Review Report and procedures document (policy document)? Not documented Level 2 Yes Documented Level 3 Yes Documented and available to applicant 22b Does this include time frames for the internal review? Yes 23a With regards to the internal review process you make available to applicants that are not granted registration: summarize the process of the internal review. The applicant is provided with a detailed letter outlining the reasons for the Board not accepting their application for registration. The letter is sent by email to facilitate communication of the information. In this letter, the applicant is advised of the Internal Review Process. The applicant is advised that if they wish to utilize the Internal Review Process they are to inform the Registrar. If they wish to use this process, the materials are provided to the Internal Review Committee. The Internal Review Committee reviews the materials and provides its written decision to the Registrar. The Registrar then provides this letter to the applicant. If an applicant provides new information, this information would be taken back to the Board, as the original decision maker, for review before it would be taken back to the Internal Review Committee. This is because the Board would not have seen the new information. If the new information leads to an approval of the application then there is no Interna l Review. If the new information leads to no change in the decision of the Board then all of the information is provided to the Internal Review Committee. We would like to revisit this item and the rating provided by the Review Officer. Level 1 Not docume nted Level 2 Documented Level 3 Documented and made available to applicant Level 2 7(a), 10, 16(3)(m) Nova Scotia Board of Examiners in Psychology Page 27 FRPA Review Report 23b Describe the opportunities made available to an applicant to make submissions respecting such review. Applicants whose credentials are not approved for registration who wish to provide additional information can provide this information to the Board. The Board will consider new information on a previous application. 23c Specify the format for the internal review submission Written 23d What is the timeline for submitted supporting evidence? Usually the applicant would be provided with 30 days to inform the Registrar if they wish to seek a review. However if they requested more time, the Board would be open to this. However, new information would first be taken back to the Board. 24a Are the results of the internal review made available to applicants in writing with reasons? Yes Level 1 Yes Level 2 Yes Specific timeline Level 3 Yes Specific timeline and communicated Level 3 24b In what timeframe are the results of the internal review made available to applicants? 1-2 months 7(a), 10(3) 24c Are these timelines communicated ? Yes 25 Have individuals who make internal review Yes. A copy of the Training Manual that is provided to all Board members is attached. Such training would have been provided to former members of the Board who comprise the Internal Review Committee, who N/A N/A 7(a), 11, 16(3)(p) Nova Scotia Board of Examiners in Psychology Page 28 FRPA Review Report decisions received appropriate training? would review registration decisions made by the Board. 26 Do you have a prohibition that states that 'no one who acted as a decision - maker in respect of a registration decision acted as a decision - maker in an internal review? Yes this is stated directly in Board Policy. Level 1 N/A Level 2 N/A Level 3 Yes Level 3 7(a), 10(5), 16(3)(n) 27 Do you have any international agreements (i.e. reciprocal recognition) endorsed by your regulatory body or national organization? No However, we do agree to expedite review of registration requirements where psychologists credentialed with the National Register of Health Service Psychologists and possess a Certificate of Professional Qualification (CPQ) from the Association of State and Provincial Psychology Boards (ASPPB). This is stated in Board Policy and on the website. N/A N/A 7 28 Has your organization experienced any unintended consequences \u2014defined as an unintended negative impact on labour market, economic, social or other condition \u2014 arising as a result of the Yes, in the sense that we have had to approve registrations for individuals who would not have been acceptable according to the registration requirements (acceptable degrees in psychology) set according to our provincial legislation. This leads to a situation where some have concerns about fairness in that local applicants are held to a different set of entry level criteria than those who apply on the basis of their registration in another Canadian jurisdiction with different criteria. N/A N/A 3 Nova Scotia Board of Examiners in Psychology Page 29 FRPA Review Report implementatio n of Chapter 7 of the Agreement on Internal Trade? 29 Does your legislation and/or regulations include labour mobility provisions (i.e. the ability to accept applicants already certified in another Canadian jurisdiction regardless of the requirements in the previous jurisdiction? Yes, but this is not specific to Canada. It states: (5) The Board may, in its discretion, waive all or part of the requirements of this Section where an applicant holds a certificate of registration as a psychologist from another province, st ate or country the standards of which are deemed by the Board to be at least equivalent to the standards required by subsection (1) or (2). 2000, c. 32, s. 15. N/A N/A Chapter 7, AIT 30 Do you review the requirements of the other provincial regulatory bodies regularly? Yes. We have some exposure to the processes of other provincial regulators. Through our membership and collective work with the national organization of regulators (ACPR O), we do regularly review other psychology regulator requirements across Canada. N/A N/A 3, Chapter 7, AIT 31a Has your organization made any changes to the occupational standards in your legislation, regulations and/or by -laws (i.e. entry to practice We have not made changes exactly, but to be thorough in our response, we have submitted a proposal for a change to the entry level requirements for new applicants in N ova Scotia (not those whose who would continue to be accepted under the AIT or those already registered) to the doctoral degree, to be in alignment with the National Standard recommended by the Association of Canadian Psychology Regulatory Organizations (A CPRO). However, this submission was provided to the Department of Health and Wellness, upon their instruction, with the understanding that it would N/A N/A 3, Chapter 7, AIT Nova Scotia Board of Examiners in Psychology Page 30 FRPA Review Report standards, continuing education requirements, codes of ethics) within the last two years? eventually go through all the required departments of government. 31b If yes, did you work with the Labour Mobility Coordinator or a Provincial Government representative to complete an AIT notification (i.e. notification form sent prior to approval that informs other Canadian jurisdictions of the proposed change)? No. We began with the Department of Health and Wellness, with the understanding that it would eventually go through all of the required departments of government. We were subsequently been informed that our request was not supported by the DHW at this time. However, the Board plans to make a new submission.

Page 5 of 9 Release of Information If you hold psychology registration then you will need to provide information about your psychology registration in all jurisdiction s where you hold such registration/licensure; and you will need to complete a release allowing the Board to follow up with questions pertaining to you r registr ation, if required . Relevant Employment Fill in this section only in relation to psychology positions. We would consider such a position to either have \"psychology\" or \"psychological\" in the title or be primarily psychologic al in content and involve the practice of psychology in the core competency areas . On the other hand, experience from practica or internships should be noted in the Verification of Practica /Internship Form; and other related work experience (but not strictly a psychology position) sh ould be listed on your CV. Psychological Practice Profile This profile is asking about the work that you intend to do in Nova Scotia. If you do not currently have employment then please answer on the basis of what you would consider to be within your a reas of competence. The profile has three main sections: A, B, C. Part A asks about your employment status, practice setting(s), and language(s)*. Please indicate whether your employment status is full or part time. (Those working part time please indi cate how many hours per week.) Then select the applicable practice setting (s) in which you are employed and identify the applicable languages in which you are comfortable providing services. Part B of the Psychological Pr actice Profile asks you to select the areas of your psychological practice and estimate the percentage of time you spend working in each area. For instance, if you spend four days per week engaged in clinical work and one day per week doing research, you would select #1, Clinical, and #5, Research.

Criminal Record Check Applicants from Canada While the Board does not complete this check, we suggest and provide a link to the website of an online provider: myBackCheck.com . This option is recommended because the results of the check can be provided fairly quickly and directly to the Board by myBackCheck . The added benefit is that the results of your check could be shared with other organizations, if you make this request to myBackCheck . However , you can also use your local police to obtain a criminal record check, but you should be aware that this option will likely take longer, and until the results are received by the Board, this will delay your ability to obtain registration . Please note : that background c hecks must have been completed within the last 6 months from the date of application in order to be considered acceptable to the Board. Applicants from outside Canada Page 9 of 9 While the Board does not complete this check, we suggest and provide a link to the website of an online provider : CSI Background Screening. They can provide background checks fo r countries outside of Canada. This option is recommended because the results of the check can be provided fairly quickly and directly to the Board by CSI. The added benefit is that the results of your check could be shared with other organizations, if y ou make this request to CSI. However , you can also use your local police to obtain a criminal record check , but you should be aware that this option will likely take longer, and until the results are received by the Board, this will delay your ability t o obtain registration . Please note : that background checks must have been completed within the last 6 months from the date of application in order to be considered acceptable to the Board. The above items comprise the steps of the online application process. 1 Registration Requir ements As per the Psychologists Act (2000), applicants for registration as psychologists are required to show they have obtained a master's, doctoral or equivalent degree in psychology that is acceptable to the Board from an educational institution approv ed the Board. As noted, t he above criteria are required by legislation. T he Board does no t have discretion to waive these requirement s. Furthermore, augmenting an insufficient degree by completing coursework or supervision after one has completed his/h er academic degree does not convert an unacceptable degree to one that is acceptable to the Board . This is because the post degree coursework and training was not part of the formal graduate degree . (1) The degree in psychology obtained by the applicant m ust meet the following criteria: i) The program must be an integrated, organized sequence of study, standing as a recognizable, coherent organizational entity within the institution. Wherever it may be administratively housed, the institution's officers m ust identify it as a psychology program, and the majority of its faculty as psychologists. For greater clarity , the Board requires the core faculty and majority of program faculty to be comprised of psychologists. ii) The program must have required an un dergraduate degree in psychology (or equivalent courses in psychology) as part of the entrance requirement. To clarify, this criterion does not simply require the applicant to possess an undergraduate degree in psychology but an undergraduate degree in ps ychology (or equivalent courses in psychology) must be an admittance requirement of the program. iii) The faculty of the program must have clear authority and primary responsibility for the core and specialty areas whether or not the program cuts across a dministrative lines. iv) The program should have a body of resident students who are enrolled in that program. Programs that are primarily based on -line are not acceptable to the Board. For further clarification, the Board has adopted the Section on Resi dency from the Model Licensing Act recently approved by the Association of State and Provincial Psychology Boards. It states: Nova Scotia Board of Examiners in Psychol ogy Suite 455, 5991 Spring Garden Road \"Residency means physical presence, in person, at an educational institution or training facility in a manner that facilitates ac culturation in the profession, the full participation and integration of the individual in the educational, and training experience and includes faculty student interaction. Training models that rely exclusively on physical presence for periods of less tha n one continuous year (e.g. multiple long weekends and/or summer intensive sessions), or that use video teleconferencing or other electronic means as a substitute for any part of the minimum requirement for physical presence at the institution do not meet this definition of residency.\" Note: The minimum period of one continuous year of residency is in addition to any practica or internship completed as part of the program requirements. v) Curriculum requirements of the program must include adequate theore tical content in psychology and supervised practicum, internship, field or laboratory training appropriate to psychology. In order to meet these requirements, the master's level degree must be at least two years in duration. Applicants are assessed with respect to competency in five core areas : Assessment and Evaluation; Intervention; Research; Ethics and Standards; and Interpersonal Relationships. Course work and experience in these areas must be listed. The program must include p ractica and /or internship directly supervised by psychologists . While members of other allied regulated professions may serve as secondary supervisors, the primary supervisor(s) must be a psychologist. The practica must be an organized and integrated compone nt of the graduate training program in psychology. Supervision outside of one's program does not count. The practica must be a minimum of 500 hours . Coursework titles/descriptions must use clear psychological terminology/abbreviations such as the words \"psych ology\", \"psychological\" \"psych .\" vi) In addition to the foregoing, the applicant must demonstrate sufficient foundational knowledge in four general areas: Knowledge o f the biological bases of behaviour; Knowledge of the cognitive -affective bases of behaviour; Knowledge of the social bases of behaviour; and Knowledge of the psychology of the individual. This must be demonstrated with at least one full course or two half courses, in each of the four areas. Introductory level courses are not acceptable for meeting this requirement. (2) The Board will consider whether the educational institut ion has recognized standing or accreditation. (3) Degrees in education, counseling, guidance, family studies, mental health studies, child studies, rehabilitation and other such designations, are not normally considered degrees in psychology. Course/Un iversity Information: 3 To be registered as a psychologist in NS y ou must have a graduate degree in psychology from a program that meets the above requirements. O n-line graduate programs are not acceptable for registration. The MASP (School Psychology) pr ogram at the Mount meets the requirements noted above; the Education Psychology (M.Ed) does not. At Acadia, the counseling M.Ed is not accept ed, but the clinical psychology (M.Sc .) is an acceptable program for registration as a Psychologist. The M.Ed. programs at either of these universities may lead to qualificat ions as a guidance counselor, school counselor or counselor, but they do not lead to psychology registration or prepare you to take the prerequisite examination for Professional Practice in Psycho logy. At times the Board is contacted by individuals who possess a degree in a related field (e.g., counselling); however their degree is not specifically in psychology and/or does not meets the Board's requirements for acceptable degrees in psychology . If applicable, you might consider checking with the Nova Scotia College of Counselling Therapists for registration eligibility. The College of Counselling Therapists is the provincial governing body for counselling therapy . NSBEP does not evaluate individual programs until an application for registration is completed. For graduate programs outside of Nova Scotia, that are not accredited by the Canadian Psychological Association or American Psychological Association: The Board will need access to information about the graduate program and faculty when you the program was taken by the applicant . For example, determining the professional status of faculty members (e.g., whether the majority and core faculty were comprised o f psychologists , etc. ), the admission requirements and other elements of the training program. This information could take the form of a program handbook which provides information about the program, course descriptions, and admission requirements. Gener ally if your graduate program was taken in the last 5 years then such information may be available online via the university's website. You should determine whether this is the case. If this is the case , then it is sufficient to provide website links (fu ll URL address) for information about your program so the Board can quickly verify programmatic information. This information can be provided in your application materials. However, if such programmatic information is not readily available online, the onus to provide complete evidence rests with the applicant and you should not rely on the Board to obtain this information. In such an instance (where information about the program is not readily available online), you should provide documentation about the graduate program along with your application if you possess such documentation (electronic /scanned copies can be provided) . Lastly, you may need to contact the university to request that they obtain programmatic information from their archives and send this information to the Board. 4 Evaluation of the initial application for registration includes ensuring the requirements of the educational program meet the Board's criteria above, checking declared competencies against transcripts, references and any other documentation submitted. Plan for Collegial Consultation In addition to arranging for Board approved supervision, applicants for Candidate Register status will be required to identify psychologists whom they can consult about workplace matters f or day -to-day consultation pertinent to the work environment. The requirement of a plan is to ensure adequate regular collegial consultation. If the workplace setting does not provide regular psychological services, consultation, the applicant must demonst rate that arrangements have been made for such consultation outside the work setting. Examinations If accepted on the Candidate Register the applicant has a period of time which to fulfill any conditions set out by the Board, to acquire a specified amoun t of supervised experience and to pass the Examination for Professional Practice in Psychology (EPPP) and the Oral Examination required for acceptance on the Register of Psychologists. The EPPP must be successfully completed, on or before, the end of the c andidates second year of candidacy. Successful completion of the Oral Exam is the final step before one is transferred to the Register of Psychologists. However, ethical and professional conduct is required from the beginning, and is specifically assessed at the end of the candidacy period along with the other core competencies as necessary. Failure to demonstrate ethical professional practice during the candidacy period and/or in the oral examination can affect progress to the permanent Register of Psycho logists. Supervision All Candidates must receive supervision f or at least 2 hours per month, regardless of whether they are currently employed, or working full time. Failure to maintain adequate supervision and timely reporting may lead to removal of th e Candidate's name from the Register of Candidates. Candidates with a master's degree in psychology acceptable to the Board must complete 4 years of supervised practice. Candidate s with a doctoral degree in psychology acceptable to the Board must complet e 2 years of supervised practice. However, one of the required two years of supervised practice required by the doctoral program may be applied to the 2 year requirement, provided the internship and supervised experience have been adequately and responsib ly supervised in a manner satisfactory to the Board. (An internship program approved by the CPA or APA would meet the requirements.) In the case of a Candidate Registrant, this will reduce the minimum required period of supervised practice to 1 year on th e Candidate Register. 5 Liability Insurance A requirement under the Psychologists Act is that all registrants must carry adequate professional liability insurance. The main insurer of psychologists is BMS Group. This is gained through one's affiliat ion with the Canadian Psychological Association (CPA) or the Association of Psychologists of Nova Scotia. The Board's legislation does not mandate the psychologist to obtain coverage through a specific company; however, registrants must ensure that they ha ve purchased adequate coverage. NSBEP requires all registrants to maintain professional liability insurance in an amount not less than $1,000,000.00 per occurrence. The insurance program from BMS Group is the exclusive and official insurance program endor sed by the Canadian Psychological Association and the Council of Professional Associations of Psychologists (CPAP). Once registered, proof of liability insurance must be provided to the Board within 30 days. Compliance with the Mutual Recognition Agreemen t (under Agreement on Internal Trade) Applicants for registration as psychologists must be able to document and / or otherwise demonstrate an adequate foundation in Psychology and proficiency in at least five core competencies recognized in the MRA. Th e initial application is evaluated by comparing the applicant's declared competencies with the other documentation submitted (e.g., transcripts, references, supervised work experience). After being placed on the Candidate Register, the candidate and the s upervisor must develop goals for supervision that are specifically designed to enhance the candidate's knowledge and skills in the core competency areas. During the period of supervision the regular reports submitted to the Board should address the goals a nd be related to the core competencies. When the candidate has provided documentation of the required supervised work experience and the supervisor has evaluated the candidate's progress in addressing the declared goals and the core competencies, the cand idate may take the oral examination for placement on the Register of Psychologists. The oral examination may address any issues arising from the supervision process, as well as assess the candidate's overall readiness for ethical professional practice. A c andidate may not be moved forward to the Register of Psychologists without passing the oral exam even when all other expectations have been met. Submitting an Application Persons who possess the qualifications for registration may apply to be registered in Nova Scotia. T o complete the online application process and for more information about the application process, please visit the Application section of the Board's website . Consistent with the public protection mandate of the Cana dian Psychology Regulators the following is the position of ACPRO on a National St andard for entry to practice requirements for practice in Psychology. The National Standard for registration as a Psyc hologist is graduation from a doctoral program in Psychology accredited by the Canadian Ps ychological Association (CPA). In the absence of graduation from a CPA accr edited program, a gra duate of a Psychology program that meets the educational qualifications as specified in Appendix A will be deemed to have the knowledge, skills and abilities substantially equivalent to a graduate of a CPA accredited program. All candidates will meet the post-graduate s upervision and examination requirements as specified in Appendix A. There is recognition that there ar e substantial differences in the knowledge, skills and ability in training at the master's level as compared with training at the doctoral level. Master's level individuals may be regulated as p s y c h o l o g i c a l p r a c t i t i oners with a specified scope and with a title that reflects this specified scope. It would be up to individual jurisdictions to determine how, or if, they will regulate master's level prov iders unless or until there is a National Standard developed for this. Appendix A I.

Foundational Knowledge is obtained in an identified Psychology program either at the graduate or senior undergraduate levels. 3. The acceptable credential for licensu re is at the graduate level and has an undergraduate degree underpinning it. II. Training Program Elements 1. Pre-Degree Supervised Practice 1. The formal training program whose credential is ac cepted for licensure must specify in pertinent institutional catalogues and brochures, its intent to train professional Psychologists and must have practical training as an integral part of the program. ACPRO Position Statement - National Standard for Entry to Practice Page 5 Adopted November 16, 2014 2. A minimum of 600 hours of pre-degree practicum experience (including a minimum of 200 hours of face to face client contact) and a minimum of 1600 hours in a pre-doctoral internship/residency is required. This is viewed as one of the necess ary pathways to the development of the core competencies. 3. The experience must be an organized and integrat ed component of the graduate training program. 4. There must be accountability by the practicum s upervisors and internship/residency program to the student's training program. 5. The practicum, pre-doctoral internship (residenc y's) primary supervisor must be a licensed Psychologist in the jurisdiction in which the student is training. 6. There must be planned and purposeful interaction with multiple members of the profession throughout the course of one's graduate training. 7. Members of other allied regulated professions may serve as secondary supervisors during practical training. 8. A minimum of 75% of the supervision during prac tical training should be direct in- person with visual or verbal communication in real time. 9. A formal evaluation of the student must be provide d, must be tied to behavioural exemplars, must clearly outline the activities engaged in, and must indicate that the practicum was successfully completed. The evaluation of a student's skill must be completed by multiple individuals/all supervisors. 2. Post-Licensure Supervised Practice: 1. Without an accredited pre-doctoral internship/resi dency, 1600 hours of supervised post- degree supervised practice is required for licensure. 2. If one has a CPA or Ordre des psychologues du Quebec accredited internship/residency, the requirement for a defined period of post-licensure supervised practice will be waived. However, until all of the requirements for independent licensure are met one must be under direct supervision. 3. The supervision hours will be logged under an approved Supe rvision Plan and Agreement. 4. Supervisors must have a minimum of 2 years of independent licensure and training/ continuing education in the provision of clinical supervision. 5. Supervisors must be licensed/registered Psychol ogists and be competent in the same practice areas to which the supervisee aspires. 6. Members of other allied regulated professions ma y serve as secondary supervisors and must be licensed with their professions' regulatory bodies. 7. A minimum of 75% of the supervision during prac tical training will be direct in-person with visual or verbal communication in real time. ACPRO Position Statement - National Standard for Entry to Practice Page 6 Adopted November 16, 2014 8. A formal evaluation of the supervisee must be pr ovided which is tied to behavioural exemplars, clearly outlines the activities engaged in, and that attests that the post- licensure supervised practice hours were successfully completed. Ev aluations must be completed by multiple individuals/all supervisors. 3. Degree Licensed: 1. Licensure under the title \"Psychologist\" will be for individuals with an applied doctoral degree in Psychology. 2. The necessary education and training for elig ibility for licensure under Psychology regulation includes a graduate degree in Psychology from a recognized program and a recognized institution; non-Psychology degrees do not qualif y for licensure. Graduate degrees without the descriptor \"Psychology\" in the program title w ill not be accepted as substantially equivalent. 3. Degrees in applied areas of Psychology are requi red for licensure (under a Psychology regulator) with the title \"Psychologist''. 4. The graduate degree must be earned prior to application for licensure. 5. Scopes of practice will differ depending on a) the ar ea in which one is trained and b) the level of graduate degree in Psychology under which one is licensing. 4. Faculty: 1. The director of training of an acceptable program must be a licensed Psychologist. 2. The core program faculty must be licensed as Psychologists. 3. The majority of faculty teaching in applie d areas of Psychology must be licensed as Psychologists. 4. The majority of professors in a training program must have a doctoral degree in Psychology. 5. Professors must have demonstrated compet ency in the areas in which they teach. 6. Adjunct faculty may be utilized but must not make up the majority of the faculty in the program. If they are teaching in applied areas they must be licensed. 7. Professors/faculty from other professions may provide training, however, must not make up the majority of faculty in the training program. If th ey are teaching in applied areas they must be licensed in the profession that they represent. 5. Academic Residency: 1. Acceptable programs must have a one-year period of \"in-person\" academic residence that is defined as one continuous academic year or two academic semesters taken in succession. Practicum and internship are not counted toward the academic residence requirement. 2. Periods of documented medical leave or maternity or paternity will not be counted in establishing whether the standard has been met. As such an applicant will not be penalized if a period of ACPRO Position Statement - National Standard for Entry to Practice Page 7 Adopted November 16, 2014 medical leave interrupted her/his academic tr aining. However he/she still must show two academic semesters, one of which is immediately prior to the medical leave and one immediately subsequent to return from that leave. 3. Shorter periods of intensive academic residence th at in combination equal one year of time will not be accepted as meeting the standard. 6. Training Objectives and Degree Granted: 1. See previous standard \"Degree Licensed\". 2. The objective of the training program must be to train the professional Psychologist, as demonstrated in their communications to the public. 3. Training must be organized, sequential, and build u pon itself. It must have the depth, breadth and increasing complexity to prepare students ultimately for practice as a Psychologist. 4. There must be practical experience that is an integral element of the training program, and multiple sources of student evaluation within the program. 5. The degree granted must be a graduate degree in Psychology. 7. Coursework Titles, Credits, Hours, Content: Foundational Knowledge and Core Co mpetency requirements (as outlined in the MRA 2001, 2004) must be earned in Psychology courses as part of un dergraduate and graduate training programs. 1. Course acceptability is established through a revi ew of course syllabi. Course title, number of courses, or number of credit hours is insufficient to establish that a core competency or Foundational Knowledge requirement has been met. 2. Experience does not equate to having taken a formal course. 8. Online/Distance Education: 1. Distance training accepted as meeting the Foundational Knowledge or Core Competency requirements must be from recognized degree granting institutions. 2. Programs delivered entirely via technology are not accepted for licensure. 3. Some training via technology is acceptable, howev er this is only for non-applied theoretical courses. III. Assessment of Core Competencies 1. Only degrees from education and training programs that are housed in recognized degree granting institutions of higher learning will be considered for licensure purposes. 2. Core competencies referenced in this Standard are those elaborated on in the MRA (2001, 2004). ACPRO Position Statement - National Standard for Entry to Practice Page 8 Adopted November 16, 2014 3. Referees must evaluate and indicate the degree to which applicants meet each of the Core Competencies. 4. Graduates of CPA accredited Psychology programs need not provide a list of coursework in their applications for licensure. For non-accredited program graduates however, a listing of courses taken, and a description of how they satisfy the core competencies will be required. Supervision 1. For the purposes of licensure, an applicant's practic um and /or internship must be completed as part of the graduate training in Psychology and primary supervision in these experiences must be provided by a licensed Psychologist. 2. In the case of candidates who have not met the c onditions outlined in II. 2.2., post-degree/post- licensure supervised practice must also be completed. IV. Licensure Examinations 1. The Examination for Professional Practice in Psyc hology (EPPP) is required. Three attempts are permitted. Examinees must pass the EPPP within 2 ye ars from the date at which they are notified of their eligibility to write the Examination. 2. A formal standardized oral examination is u sed as a final step in assessing one's readiness for independent licensure. 3. Candidates must demonstrate their knowledge of lo cal jurisprudence prior to being granted an independent license to practice. Definitions of the Five Core Competency Areas Assessment and Evaluation Definition : A competent professional psychol ogist draws on diverse methods of evaluation, determining which methods are best suited to the task at hand, rather than relying solely or primarily on formalized test ing as an automatic response to situations requiring assessment. The appropriate subject of evaluation may either be an individual person, or a couple, family, organization or system. The skills required for assessment can and should be applied to many situations beyond that of initial evaluation, including, for example, treatment outcome, program ev aluation, and problems occurring in a broad spectrum of non-clinical setti ngs. The primary purpose of psychological assessment is to provide an understanding that informs a prac tical plan of action. It may result in a diagnostic classification or in the identif ication of strengths or competencies. Knowledge should include: Knowledge of asse ssment methods, populations served, human development, diagnosis. Skills should include: Formulation of referra l question(s), sele ction of methods, collection and processing of information, utilization of psychometric methods, formulation of hypotheses, diagnoses, and action plans, and report writing. Interventions Definition : The intervention competency is concep tualized as activities that promote, restore, sustain, and/or enhance positive func tioning and a sense of well-being in clients through preventative, developmental and/or remedial services. A broad, comprehensive vision of the intervention competency should in clude theory as well as the application of knowledge and skills. Knowledge should include: Knowledge of varied interventions with i n d i v i d u a l s a n d systems (e.g., families, organizations); of the relative efficacy of interventions to promote health and wellness; of the positive aspect s of all major approaches, reflecting openness to varied viewpoints and met hods; of when to make appropriate referrals and when to consult; and of cultural context and dive rsity, and implications for intervention. Skills s h o u l d i n c l u d e : T h e s e l e c t i o n o f a p p r o p riate intervention me thods; analysis of information, development of a conceptual fra mework, and communication of this to the client, as appropriate; gathering information about the nature and severity of problems and forming hypotheses about factors contribut ing to the problem through qualitative and quantitative means; establishment and main tenance of professi onal all appropriate interdisciplinary relationships with colleagues; the applic ation of appropriate knowledge to provide effective intervention that addresses the needs of clients Research Definition : P r o f e s s i o n a l p s y c h o l o g i s t s s h o u l d h a v e research training such that they develop a basic understanding of a n d r e s p e c t f o r the scientific und erpinnings of the discipline, knowledge of methods to be good consumers of the products of scientific knowledge, and sufficient skills in the conduct of research to be able to develop and carry out projects in a professiona l or academic context. Knowledge should include: Knowledge of research methods and of the applications of scientific research; applied statistics and measurement theory; the logic of different models of scientific research (from laborat ory experimentation to quasi-experimental and field research); and quantitative and qualita tive research methods (including observation and interviewing), with respect to the nature of reliability and validity in the gathering and interpretation of data. Skills s h o u l d i n c l u d e : C r i t i c a l r e a s oning skills in interpreti ng and evaluating research procedures and findings; appr opriate applications of various research approaches; and ability to write professional and empirically based reports. Ethics and Standards Definition : Psychologists conduct themselves in an ethical manner consistent with the Canadian Code of Ethics for Psychologists. They conduct professi onal relationships within the context of the Code and Standards for the Profession. Knowledge should include: Knowledge of the ethical principles of the Canadian Code of Ethics and the ethical decision making process promoted with the Code, the Standards of Professional Conduct, the Standards for Provi ders of Psychological Services, and, as appropriate, other standards such as Standards for Psychological Tests and Measurements, Standards for Conducting Psyc hological Research, as well as relevant jurisprudence. Skills s h o u l d i n c l u d e : A p p l i c a t i o n o f t h e e t h i cal decision making process, pro-active identification of potential ethical dilemmas a nd application of the process for resolution of ethical dilemmas. Interpersonal Relationships Definition : This basic competency forms part of all the other competencies. Psychologists normally do their work in the context of interpersonal relationships (parent-child, spouses, boss-employ ee, etc.). They must therefor e be able to establish and maintain constructive working alliances with their clients and possess adequate sensitivity to cultural issues. Knowledge should include: Knowledge of theories and empirical data on the professional relationship, such as interpersonal, power relati onships, therapeutic alliance, interface with social psychology, and fluc tuations of the therapeutic/professional relationship as a function of the interventi on setting; knowledge of self, such as motivation, resources, values, personal bias es and factors that may influence the professional relationship (e.g., boundary issues ); and knowledge of others, such as macro-environment in which the person functions (e.g., work, national norms) and micro- environment (e.g., personal differenc es, family, gender differences) Skills should include: Evidence of effective communication, and evidence of establishment and maintenance of rapport, and of trust and respect in professional relationships. APPLICATIONS Policy Number 3 -30 Date of Board Approval: 17th June 2005 SUBJECT: CANADIAN TRANSFERS UNDER CHAPTER 7 OF THE AGREEMENT ON INTERNAL TRADE. POLICY STATEMENT: Applicants, fully registered in another signato ry jurisdiction, who are in good standing qualify for expedited registr ation . PROCEDURE: (1) The Psychologi st wanting to transfer in is required to complete a Transfer Application F orm and to forward a current CV. (2) The Psychologist signs a release to allow NSBEP to communicate with his/her home j urisdiction. This release includes permission f or disclosure of curren t restrictions or limitations on the license, and of unresolved complaints and/or prior disciplinary actions. (3) The Psychologist is required to arrange for a Criminal Record Check and a Child Abuse Register Check. (4) The Psychologist is required to submit the Confirmation of Standing form to their current jurisdiction and arrange for it to be completed and returned directly to NSBEP . (5) Only those Applicants who are fully registered qualify for full registration in No va Scotia . (6) Once the home jurisdiction has confirmed the Applicants status and the AR has searched the ASPPB disciplinary database , if all is in order the Psychologist can be placed on the Courtesy Register, upon request, pending receipt of the Criminal and Child Abuse Register checks. (7) If additional information or clarification is required the AR contacts the home jurisdiction. This communication is noted in a memo to file and placed on the file. (8) Once confirmation of the Criminal Records Check and Chil d Abuse Register Check is received, a transfer interview is arranged. (9) Following the transfer interview, the Psychologist is transferred to th e Register of Psychologists upon payment of the Applicable Registration Fee. (10) If problems/issues were identified in the transfer interview, placement on the Register of Psychologists may involve conditions only if the Board has a permitted Legitimate Objective approved by Government . Such conditions are noted in writing and placed on the p sychologist 's file. The Boar d will provide feedback and is free to make recommendations however. 27th May 2005 Revised August 2009 Form for Notice of Exception to Full Labour Mobility NOTICE OF EXCEPTION TO LABOUR MOBILITY TO MEET A LEGITIMATE OBJECTIVE UNDER CHAPTER 7 OF THE AGREEMENT ON INTERNAL TRADE APPROVED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF NOVA SCOTIA Occupation: Psychologist Name the Province(s)/Territory(ies) whose workers are affected: Alberta, Newfoundland and Labrador , Northwest Territories Under which legitimate objective(s) is the exception being filed: Consumer Protection Rationale /Justification : Psychologist s registered in Nova Scotia are required to have foundational knowledge and core competencies in p sycholog y agreed to by Canadian regulators . Basic requirements are a Masters, Doctorate or equivalent degree in p sychology from an educational program and institution approved by the NS Board of Examiners in Ps ychology as provided for in the Nova Scotia Psychologists Act . In addition, applicants must have an undergraduate degree or equivalent, in psychology and demonstrate compete ncy in the five core areas: Assessment and Evaluation, Ethics and Standards, Intervention, Research and Interpersonal Relationships. Alberta, Newfoundland and Labrador and Northwest Territories accep t applicants for registration from programs which do not meet the Nova Scotia requirements for an approved program or institution . The Board examined the programs accepted in these jurisdictions and identified programs which were found to provide inadequate preparation in two or more of the five core compet encies agreed to by Canadian regulators. Additional Requirements: Supervision by a Registered Psychologist for 2 years with the ability to add conditions if needed . Duration of the additional requirement: Indefinite Date of Notification to FLMM: 2011 / 11 / 16 YY MM DD Nova Scotia Board of Examiners in Psychology Suite 455, 5991 Spring Garden Road Transfer Interviews for Psychologists Registered in Canada All psychologists in Nova Scotia are expected to possess or demonstrate an understanding of professional practice and ethical issues, and have an understanding of the practice of psychology in NS (public and private system). As such, the Transfer Interview serves to introduce and orient psychologists to practice in NS. This may involve a discussion about practice standards and ethics, as well as differences that may exist between NS and other jurisdictions. Panel: The typical panel contains two Board members, one of whom is chair, and one psychologist not on the Board. The interview must be held in-person with the committee members and the applicant. Fee: The fee is Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) and payable one week in advance of the interview. The Board accepts payment online by cheque, Visa, MasterCard, and American Express. All fees (i.e. Transfer Interview and Registration) can be paid online using credit card. To pay your fees online, visit the Applicants section of the website (www.nsbep.org) and select the Online Payments for Applicants tab. Alternatively, you may call or fax your credit card information into the office or send payment by mail. Preparation: This is not specifically a jurisprudence exam; however it would be helpful to consult the Board document \"Standards of Practice\". This document contains the standards, and a listing of relevant legislation and guidelines. The URL is: http://www.nsbep.org/downloads/Binder_Standards_Legislation_Guidelines.pdf The Interview: This is not an open book interview. No books or papers are permitted in the exam room. Electronic devices must be turned off and taping is not permitted. The content is confidential. The chair asks the applicant to describe his or her past work settings, to indicate some ethical dilemmas that have arisen, and to describe how they were resolved. Additionally applicants may be asked to discuss their intended work setting in Nova Scotia. Each member of the panel is free to ask questions and pose problems for the applicant's consideration. Because our registration is generic, the questions tend to focus on the actual work situation of the applicant rather than following a pre-arranged agenda. Nevertheless the panel is not limited to the applicant's own examples, but is free to develop hypothetical scenarios, to ask about issues that the applicant may not have introduced, and so on. The applicant is then asked to leave and to wait nearby until the panel has deliberated and is in a position to offer feedback. Post Interview feedback: When the applicant returns the panel offers feedback. For example, the committee may suggest standards that the psychologist should review and resources that a psychologist could access to facilitate a successful transition to NS. Options for the Panel: The requirement of mobility of Canadian workers is legislated by government through the Canadian Free Trade Agreement (CFTA). The CFTA bypasses the Board's statutory authority and requires registration of individuals who meet the criteria of the CFTA. It does not allow conditions to be placed on the psychologist's registration arising from the interview, unless the Board has a Legitimate Objective. The Panel can offer feedback and make recommendations. For example, the committee may suggest standards that the psychologist should review and resources that a psychologist could access to facilitate a successful transition to NS. However, the Board cannot require any conditions on the registration of a psychologist covered by the CFTA, unless they are the same condition(s) or restriction(s) that exist in the applicant's home jurisdiction. If a condition or restriction exists on the psychologist's registration in the home jurisdiction, this would be stated on the Confirmation of Standing Form completed by the home jurisdiction and submitted to the NSBEP. This matter would be considered when the initial application for registration is reviewed by the Board prior to the interview. The Board has an approved Legitimate Objective. Currently, the Board's Legitimate Objective covers graduates of two programs: The Master of Counselling from Athabasca University and the Master of Education in Counselling Psychology from Memorial University. The graduate's degree would be identified to the Board when the completed application is reviewed. The possibility of a condition would be conveyed to the transfer interview committee prior to the interview. The need for a condition of supervision would be assessed during the transfer interview. If the committee determines that a condition of supervision is warranted, the candidate would be advised of such in the feedback session of the oral exam. The condition would then be noted in writing and placed on the psychologist's file. The criteria used in the assessment process is outlined in the Board's Registration Requirements: http://www.nsbep.org/downloads/Registration_Requirements_CanadianPsychologists.pdf The Legitimate Objective allows the Board to place a condition on the psychologist's registration to require supervision for a period up to two years following registration and to reassess the need for further supervision or conditions after the initial period of supervision has been completed by the psychologist. However, the length of supervision should not be arbitrary. It should be proportional to the identified need and the committee is free to require a shorter period of supervision than two years. For information about the rationale of the above noted Legitimate Objective please visit the following URL: https://www.cfta-alec.ca/labour-mobility/ Last revised November 2017 Nova Scotia Board of Examiners in Psychol ogy Suite 455, 5991 Spring Garden Road Oral Examination Information for Candidates General Information about the Exam This is not an open book exam. No books or papers are permitted in the exam room. Electronic devices must be turned off and taping is not permitted . The content is confidential. The Oral Examination Committee Your committee will consist of two psycholog ists from the Board and a third psychologist from the community. Once your committee has been established, the Assistant to the Registrar will con tact you with the names of the committee members and the date and time of the examination The examiners will review your candidate file prior to the start of the examination. The Format for the Examination The Chair of the committee will introduce all parties and explain to you the three possible outcomes. These are pass, pass with conditions or fail (see below for more details). At this point you will be given the opportunity to ask questions. The examiners conduct a semi -structured interview. You s hould be familiar with the four principals of the Canadian Code of Ethics. You are not expected to be able to recite the many standards that make up the Code but you are expected to be familiar with them. You are also expected to be able to apply the ethic al decision making process to an ethical dilemma related to your area of practice. You will be asked to talk about your practice and to answer a series of questions reflecting issues that may arise in the course of it. You will also be expected to respond to questions involving familiarity with public policy related to your work, such as The Children and Family Services Act. This examination will generally take between one and two hours. At the conclusion of the examination you will be asked to leave the room so that the committee members can deliberate. After they have reached a decision you will be invited back into the room. You will be informed about the results of the examination and the Chair of the Committee will generally inform you of the rationa le for the decision reached. The Outcomes Pass Conditional Pass Fail Referral to Full Board Pass: The chair and committee members will provide you with feedback. You will be welcomed to Register of Psychologists. Conditional Pass: Under 14 (6) of the Psychologists Act (2000): The Board may fix conditions, limitations and restrictions applicable to persons whose names are entered on the Registers. In the case where the Oral Committee identifies areas of deficit that are containable and do not limit readiness for or have negative implications for general practice, they may approve you to the Register of Psychologists but place a condition or restriction on your registration that would limit your practice in some manner. The reason for the restriction /condition will be explained to you and you will have the opportunity to ask questions. Normally you would also be informed of what would be required of you before the Board would consider an application to have the restriction/condition lifted. Fail: Should you fail, the examiners will discuss this decision with you and give you the opportunity to ask questions. They will summarize the examination results and refer you forward for a Full Board Oral. The Assistant to the Registrar will provide you with t he date and time that this will take place. It generally occurs within the next month or two as the intent is to serve as a reliability check with respect to the first result rather than to provide you with an additional preparation time. At the Full Boa rd Oral, the Board has the same three decisions available as the Oral Examination Committee. If they confirm the failure, you will generally not be allowed to re-take the oral examination until you have completed some form of remedial process. A remedial p lan is developed on an individual basis to meet your specific needs. The Assistant to the Registrar will provide you with additional information should this be the outcome of your examination. Should you fail on your second attempt and should the second Full Board Oral confirm the failure, you may be removed from the Candidate Register under 14. (7) of the Psychologists Act for failing to meet a condition of your Candidacy. Referral to Full Board: In the rare ev ent that Committee members cannot reach consensus about their decision with respect to a pass, pass with conditions, or failure, you will be r eferred to the full Board for a second Oral Examination. You will subsequently be informed of the date and time that this will take place. It generally o ccurs within the next month or two Revisions : 22nd June 2015 2nd April, 2012 8th June 2010; 19th October 2007 NOVA SCOTIA BOARD OF EXAMINERS IN PSYCHOLOGY Criteria for Evaluating Candidates GENERAL: Candidates must be able to: identify the four basic principles, how they are ordered and why they are ordered demonstrate awareness of the ethical decision making process and recognize what constitutes an ethical dilemma demonstrate an awareness of the types of issues most likely to occur within his/her practice setting demonstrate awareness of an ethical decisio n making process and apply this to a real or hypothetical dilemma from his/her practice explain what is meant by limits of competence and provide an example of a limit that applies with respect to him/her provide a summary of his/her practice and identify his/her knowledge of theory and best practice in each of the core competency areas. Identify what access they have to other psychologists for the purposes of workplace consultation. Identify legislation relevant to his/her area of practice. APPLICATION O F THE CODE OF ETHICS : In addition to knowing the four principles, the candidate should be able to : Articulate that all four principles are taken into account and balanced in ethical decision making. He/she should also be aware that the principles are ordered according to the weight each generally should be given when they conflict but that the complexity of ethical conflicts precludes a firm ordering of principles. Provide a real or hypothetical dilemma fro m his/her practice and clearly articulate which principles were in conflict and why ; how they balanced the four principles and; the basis for his/her chosen decision . While it is not necessary to identify the steps in the ethical decision making process by name, he/she should give evidence of an understanding of all aspects of the process. List two or more areas within his/her practice where ethical dilemmas are possible and state what form of proactive decision -making might help prevent problems in the two areas identified. 2 LIMITS OF COMPETENCE: A candidate should b e able to : Describe in his/her own words what is meant by the phrase \"limits of competence\". Defin e his/her limits of competence including populations served. Give an example from his/her area of practice that demonstrates awareness of a competence boundary. KNOWLEDGE OF BEST PRACTICE AND THEORY IN THE CORE COMPETENCY AREAS: In addition to knowledge of the Code and the ethical decision making process as it applies to a candidate 's setting they should also be able to describe his/her practice as it relates to each of the other Core Competency areas.

The intention of this practice restricti on is to ensure that candidates have access to registered psychologists for collegial support, consultation and supervision in the workplace. The Board's Supervision Handbook includes a requirement for periodic contact between the candidate's NSBEP Supervisor and his/her workplace supervisor. It is intended that this process will be one of the assessment methods used for monitoring and evaluating the candidate's progress. Candidates need to ensure that they have signed the appropriate consent forms allowing their manager/supervisor to provide feedback to their Board Supervisor. Preferably this manager/supervisor would be a psychologist. If however a psychologist is not available then another manager/super visor who can provide evaluative feedback to the Board Supervisor would be acceptable. In this instance the candidate must have another psychologist for collegial support and consultation, in addition to his/her NSBEP Supervisor. As of January 2012, applicants for placem ent on the Candidate Register will be required to ensure that their Board Supervisor receives a copy of any performance evaluations that are conducted during their employment. Policy statement: Candidates are not permitted to c onduct an independent prac tice. A primary purpose of the candidacy period is to assess the candidate in the core competency areas. Until the candidat e has been assessed as ready for independent practice and has passed the required exam inations, all independent practice activities are vi ewed as inappropriate. Candidates may have provided services under previously acquired credentials. Nonetheless, any related activities which fall within the scope of the practice of psychology are considered to be withi n NSBEP's jurisdiction and must be supervised.

Board members, and those who serve as staff to professional regulatory boards, are some of the most dedicated and least appreciated individuals in both countries. At the same time, from the outset most board members are ill prepared for their jobs as professional regulators. Many have served admirably as members and officers of professional associations whose purposes and goals are quite different from those of regulatory boards. Professional associations exist for a number of reasons, but their primary purposes are the promotion of a profession and its individual members. A professional regulatory board, while typically made up of a majority of professionals, exists to protect the public. Understanding and appreciating this difference is of primary importance to success as a regulator. Professional regulation involves much in the way of legislation and litigation and most board members are not trained in the law. Some struggle with the litigiousness of rule making and adjudication, the two primary functions of any regulatory board. Input from local counsel is essential to understanding the role board members play since statutes and rules vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. This manual is designed to assist board members through the transition from novice board member to experienced professional regulator. This manual can be used to facilitate a workshop or retreat to train new and even experienced board members as they transition into this new role as professional regulator. Organizing a Training Session A successful training session for new and more experienced professional regulators must be comprehensive but streamlined as much as practical and possible. A full day should be allowed for the session, since this manual does not include many issues that may be specific to certain professions. The training session should include the current board chair and chief staff officer or board administrator. Local legal counsel to the board should also be present and prepared to make several presentations on issues outlined in the manual. While such a training session can be conducted off-site, the better approach may be to hold the session in the board's offices. After the introduction of the all participants, the board chair or administrator should introduce each member of the professional staff. Those staff members that have responsibility for important agency functions should be present to describe their responsibilities at the outset of the session. Particular attention should be paid to accurately describing the parameters of special programs, such as an alternative disciplinary program or a dispute resolution process. If possible, those persons should remain available during the day in case questions arise. A tour of the office should occur at some time during the session. 2 Someone other than the board's chair or administrator should be in charge of leading the training session and should begin her/his responsibilities at this point, starting with a review of any other written materials prepared for the training session. Resources Professional Regulators Will Need A good professional regulator has to learn a great deal about state/provincial government in a short period of time. Over the years significant standardization has occurred and there are a number of identifiable documents that every regulator needs to read regardless of the jurisdiction he/she serves. Those include: 1. U.S., Canadian Federal, State, Provincial Constitutions 2. The enabling statute that creates this board 3. The rules and regulations by which the board operates 4. The jurisdiction's Administrative Procedure Act (APA) 5. The jurisdiction's Open Meetings Law 6. The jurisdiction's Public Information Act 7. The jurisdiction's Ethics Law 8. Attorney General's Opinions; Executive Orders 9. Any other statute local counsel suggests adding to this manual There are other resources that some boards will need depending on the size and scope of their responsibilities. Many of these documents are more pertinent to board administrators and staff than board members and typically involve personnel and/or employment matters. Definitions There are some words or terms that are used quite often when regulators discuss the tasks involved in regulating a profession. Some definitions might be helpful to new board members and staff persons. Those include: Adjudication - A decision made by an administrative agency acting in a quasi-judicial capacity; the decision making process for an administrative agency. Administrative Law -The body of law, both statutory and case law, that deals with the manner in which agencies operate. Contested Case - A matter which an agency must deal with in a formal way, under the applicable provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act. Jurisdiction - The legal authority by which an agency exerts its control over a licensee or a professional issue; a geographical and political entity such as a state, province or territory that is empowered to regulate professional activity to protect its citizens. 3 Responsibilities of Regulatory Board Members 1. First and foremost, professional regulatory board exists to serve the people of the jurisdiction and your focus as a board member is to assist in that goal. 2. An individual is a public official and a public servant when serving as a member of a regulatory board. 3. There are many ways in which a board works to achieve its goal of public protection. The first is setting appropriate policies and goals for your administrator(s) and staff. Board members set policies, they don't implement them. Be knowledgeable, be thoughtful, and have purpose when setting policies, then let your administrator(s) carry them out. 4. One of the primary responsibilities of a board member is to ensure that the agency is financially sound and its funds are lawfully and wisely spent. Oversee the expenditure of funds by reviewing finances for the board as a whole, not by personal review of every organizational voucher. 5. A strong board is an asset to the people that you serve. Support your administrator(s) and staff and see that their needs for education, training and staff development are met. 6. Let your board administrator be in charge and responsible for implementing the policies established by the board. Provide adequate compensation, direction, motivation and feedback. 7. Offer your own particular skills to the board and staff when necessary and appropriate. A properly functioning board works as a team. 8. Organize a plan for your board. Consider particular needs, goals, the expertise of various members and terms of office. Make your plan at least three years in length and don't worry about day-to-day activities. See and concentrate on the big picture. 9. Participate in board meetings and other board activities. Respond promptly to requests from the board chair or staff so that the board can discharge its duties in a timely and responsible manner. 10. Finally, don't lose sight of #1. 4 GENERAL RULES FOR BOARD MEMBERS Appointments to Office Board members are typically appointed to office by the executive branch of government, although other methods exist in some jurisdictions. Prospective board members should ascertain that they meet the statutory qualifications for appointment before accepting the appointment. It is very important that members continue to meet the requirements while serving in their official capacities. Failing to do so can result in challenges to official board actions and may result in liability. Once appointed, they should carry out any statutory mandates regarding the oath of office and filing of credentials. Roles and Duties The roles and duties of members of boards are typically defined in statutes and regulations. Members are expected to carry out these duties which typically include: assessing candidates' qualifications for certification and licensure, conducting hearings, adjudicating disciplinary matters, and adopting rules and regulations. These responsibilities are done with the goal of protecting public health, safety, and welfare. On occasion boards are required to cooperate with other state and federal agencies to enforce other laws and regulations. Conflict of Interest Board members are public officials and should conduct their public duties in a manner that avoids criticism and liability. Board members should not attempt to regulate economics of the profession through board activities. When acting as a board member, you should be both seen by others and comfortable within yourself that you can be impartial, reasonable and fair in your judgments and actions. Much thought should be given to the advisability of being both a board member and an officer of a professional association at the same time, or a committee member of such association, if the association's activities could possibly influence decisions to be made as a board member. Participation simply as a member of an association should not be discouraged however. Remember, that problems are created most often by the appearance of impropriety rather than by actual misconduct. Board members who perceive even a potential conflict of interest should act swiftly to resolve the conflict. This may mean resignation from an office or committee membership. In disciplinary matters before the board it may mean that a board member is recused, unless recusal would render adjudication impossible. Remember, sometimes it is only the appearance of impropriety that leads to serious problems. Confidentiality In the very beginning of a term, each board member should ascertain the types of information to which he/she is privy; i.e., what is confidential or privileged and what is public. Some documents and/or records of the agency are public and subject to public scrutiny. 5 However, it is best to avoid disclosure of the sensitive details contained in a licensee's file unless appropriately requested. Timing, as with many things, is an important issue. Consent orders may eventually become public documents, but may be confidential until they are executed. In many jurisdictions, investigatory files are completely confidential. Some discussion should be held on the matter of the appropriateness of public comments by board members and staff. New board members should be cautioned about discussing board related business with licensees involved in the disciplinary process. If possible, some understanding should be reached regarding whose responsibility it is to communicate as the official spokesperson for the agency, particularly if the sources seeking comment are the media or individuals affiliated with the legislative process. PAUSE YOUR DISCUSSIONS AND HAVE STAFF OR COUNSEL DISTRIBUTE COPIES OF YOUR JURISDICTION'S PUBLIC RECORDS LAW(S) AND HAVE THEM COMMENT ON THE FOLLOWING: 1. What board records are open to public inspection without notice? Are there any limitations that can or should be imposed? 2. What are the limitations on public inspection that are contained in statutes such as the Americans with Disabilities Act? 3. Do the copyright laws affect public inspection and/or copying? If so, what does the staff need to know? 4. Can the board charge for making copies of public documents? If so, are there limitations? 5. Who is (are) the official spokesperson(s) for the board? 6. What can board members discuss with other licensees or the press? Notes: 6 CONDUCT OF BOARD MEETINGS Every professional regulatory board holds meetings, but some meet much more often than others. Some suggestions regarding meetings may be helpful. Notices Many states and provinces have statutes that direct agencies to give public notice of the time and place that agency meetings are to be held. These legal mandates normally establish how the notice must be transmitted, and set out the necessary time frames. Agency staff should be responsible for knowing the applicable guidelines and complying with them. PAUSE YOUR DISCUSSIONS AND HAVE STAFF OR COUNSEL DISTRIBUTE COPIES OF YOUR JURISDICTION'S OPEN MEETINGS LAWS AND COMMENT ON THE FOLLOWING: 1. What steps must be taken to advertise a board meeting? Are there exceptions to the general rule? 2. Who is allowed to attend board meetings? Are there any limitations on the attendance by media such as audio/visual recording devices? 3. Under what circumstances can a board meeting be closed to the public? Are these situations mandatory or can they be waived? 4. Are all disciplinary hearings open or closed meetings? And who decides, the agency or the respondent? Quorum Either statute or internal rules and regulations will establish the number of members that must be present for a board to conduct business. Usually a majority is required, but in some circumstances a lesser number may be legally sufficient. Minutes of the meetings should always reflect the presence of the appropriate number of members. Responsibilities of the Chairperson 1. Recognize board members entitled to speak or propose motions. Note: some motions may be made while another member has the floor. Speaker must state the purpose of the interruption so the chair can rule on its validity. 2. Restate motions after they have been made, then open discussion. This ensures that everyone is clear about the action being debated and allows more time for the motion to be accurately recorded. 7 3. Close discussion and put motions to vote. Votes on undebatable motions should be called immediately. If any member objects to closing discussion on a debatable motion, a vote is required in order to close a debate. Restate the motion exactly as it was made or amended before calling for a vote. 4. Announce the result of a vote immediately. A tie vote defeats a motion requiring a majority of those voting. The chair may vote to make or break a tie. 5. Avoid entering into any controversy or interfering with legitimate motions. 6. Maintain order and proper procedure, making necessary rulings promptly and clearly. 7. Expedite board business in every way compatible with the rights of board members. You can allow brief remarks on nondebatable motions, advise board members how to take action (proper motion or form of motion), or propose routine action without a formal vote (\"If there is no objection, these minutes will stand approved as read. Hearing no objections, so ordered.\"). 8. Protect the board from frivolous motions intended to obstruct the board's business. You can refuse to entertain such motions. Never adopt such a course, however, merely to expedite business. 9. Guard the board's time by having them vote to adopt an agenda at the beginning of the meeting. Follow the agenda faithfully. Do not permit unauthorized interruptions by spectators. PAUSE YOUR DISCUSSIONS AND CONSIDER HOW FORMAL YOUR BOARD MEETINGS SHOULD BE. ASK COUNSEL IF THERE ARE STATUTORY MANDATES RELATIVE TO THIS ISSUE. Notes: Principles of Parliamentary Procedure Based on Robert's Rules of Order 1. Parliamentary procedure requires that all board members have equal rights; there be mutual respect among board members; and the rights of the minority to initiate motions, debate, and have their votes counted be protected, while at the same time the will of the majority governs. 2. Only one item may be under consideration at a time. 8 3. The majority vote decides the questions. 4. Any question which limits board members' rights of discussion or which changes the agreed order of business requires a vote of the members present. 5. Any matter once decided cannot be brought up again at the same meeting, except by a motion to reconsider (see Motions, section 2 for procedure). 6. The simplest, clearest and most expeditious way is considered proper, so long as it does not violate the rights of board members. Proposing and Disposing of a Motion 1. Gain floor by being recognized by chair. 2. State motion: \"I move that...\". 3. Motion is seconded by any member without gaining floor. (Second not required under Keesey's Modern Parliamentary Procedure) 4. Chair states motion (if proper) and opens it for discussion (if debatable). 5. During discussion the motion may be amended or disposed of by postponement (to a time certain or indefinitely), referred to a committee, or tabled. 6. The chair puts the motion to a vote when there is no further discussion. 7. The chair announces the outcome of the vote. Motions 1.

Effect Of Motion: Chair must retake vote by show of hands or written vote which can be counted. 14. Appeal Chair's Decision: Requires second, majority vote, debatable, not amendable. A. Purpose: To overrule a decision made by the chair. B. Form: \"Chairperson, I appeal from the decision of the chair\". C. Restrictions: Must be made as soon as the decision is announced. Debatable if pending question is debatable. Can be laid on the table, which takes the pending question with it. D. Effect Of Adoption: If less than majority sustain chair, decision is reversed. 15. Motion To Recess: Requires second, majority vote, not debatable, not amendable. A. Purpose: To provide a short interruption of the meeting. B. Amendable: As to length of recess. C. Restrictions: Treated as a main motion if no other matter pending or if proposed recess is not to be taken immediately. 16. Motion To Adjourn: Requires second, majority vote, not debatable, not amendable. A. Purpose: To end the meeting immediately. B. Restrictions: Treated as a main motion if qualified in any way. 12 C. Effect Of Adoption: chair must adjourn meeting immediately, although necessary announcements may be made and a motion to fix a time for the next meeting may be entertained. 17. Motion To Fix Time For Next Meeting: Requires second, majority vote, not debatable, amendable. A. Purpose: To set time for next meeting (either regular or special). B. Restrictions: Treated as a main motion if no other question pending or if provision has already been made for another meeting on this day or the next. Minutes Many state/territorial/provincial codes require agencies to keep minutes of their meetings. This is a serious mandate and should not be taken lightly. Strict adherence to laws and regulations pertaining to minutes is absolutely necessary. Some states/territories/provinces may also have filing requirements for agency minutes. The form and content of minutes are usually flexible, however they should contain a concise summary of the meeting and business conducted. By all means, make sure that authorizations for travel, or the expenditure of funds, are properly noted in the minutes of the meetings that precede such travel and/or expenditures. Emergency Meetings Most state/provincial notice requirements make provisions for \"emergency\" meetings. The agency will probably be required to state the reason for the \"emergency\" meeting within the notice that will also be required. Such meetings should only be called when an emergency does exist and delayed action would cause serious problems. PAUSE YOUR DISCUSSIONS AND ASK COUNSEL IF THERE ARE STATUTES OR CASE LAW WITHIN YOUR JURISDICTION THAT OUTLINE WHAT CAN OR CAN'T BE DONE IN AN \"EMERGENCY\" SITUATION. Notes: RULEMAKING One of the primary responsibilities of the professional regulatory board is the promulgation of rules to complement the enabling statute. Rulemaking can be laborious, but the process and the product are extremely important. Virtually every statute that creates an agency to regulate any profession, allows the agency 13 to adopt rules and regulations to carry out its statutory mandate. These rules and regulations are absolutely necessary because they provide for the manner in which the agency conducts business. Statutes never can be specific enough to delineate the many facets of professional life; rules and regulations provide the necessary framework. There is no such thing as inherent rule making authority; legislative delegation is required. Once authorized, the failure to make necessary rules may lead to problems. Athay v. State, Dept. of Business Regulation, 626 P.2d 956 (Utah 1981). Definition A \"rule\" or \"regulation\" basically means any agency statement that (a) implements, interprets, or prescribes law or policy, and (b) describes the procedure or practice requirements of an agency. The term does not include statements concerning only the internal management or organization of the agency, not affecting private rights or procedures. Proper Promulgation Almost every jurisdiction has an Administrative Procedures Act (APA). This statute typically dictates the steps that must be taken to adopt an agency rule. The requirements for rule making procedures vary across jurisdictions, but usually include: (1) published notice; (2) explanation or statement of purpose and effect; (3) filing of the proposed rule; (4) statutory authority by which the proposed rule is to be adopted; (5) requests for comment and/or hearing and the procedures for submitting or obtaining same; and (6) necessary deadlines. The publication of adopted rules, proposed rules and repealed rules normally occurs in a jurisdictional official publication. Strict compliance with the mandates for promulgation of a rule is absolutely necessary. Fitzgerald v. Oregon Bd. of Optometry, 706 P.2d 586 (Or. App. 1985). PAUSE YOUR DISCUSSIONS AND HAVE STAFF OR COUNSEL DISTRIBUTE THE RULE MAKING MANDATES OF YOUR JURISDICTION'S APA. Notes: Limitations on Rulemaking While the legislature can delegate to an agency the authority to adopt rules and regulation, there are limitations on the rulemaking authority. First, the scope and effect of rules must remain within statutory parameters. Any rule that exceeds or alters the authority contained in the statute is subject to be voided, if challenged. Dept. of Professional Reg. v. Sherman College, 682 So.2d 559 (Fla.App.1 Dist. 1995); Dioguardi v. Superior Court, 909 P.2d 481 (Ariz. App. 1995). 14 Most APA's contain a provision that allows rules to be challenged in the same manner that contested cases are adjudicated. Should such a challenge be made, a fact-finding hearing may be necessary with an order issued by either a hearing officer or the Board. Rules properly adopted and within legal parameters should be upheld. Marchetti v. Alabama Bd. of Examiners in Psychology, 494 So.2d. 448 (Ala.Civ.App. 1986); 649 N.Y.S. 2d 191 (A.D.3 Dept. 1996); Billings v. Wyoming Bd of Outfitters, 2001 WY 81 (2001). Legislative Oversight Please note that all APA's have a mechanism that allows the legislature or legislative committee to oversee the promulgation of agency rules. Most APA's require an agency to deliver copies of proposed rules to this committee. Given the large number of rules that are proposed each month there is a real question as to how much oversight is actually exercised. However, regular review of proposed rules is a typical assignment for lobbyists for special interest groups. Those individuals usually call legislative attention to rules their employees oppose. Emergency Rulemaking An emergency rule is one that is necessitated by a impending need or an immediate danger. These rules are normally limited to state or provincial action that is deemed necessary to protect the public health, safety, or welfare. The agency must be able to document both the danger and the need to act on an emergency basis. Under most APA's, an emergency rule can only be in effect for a set period of time, i.e., 90 to 120 days. At the end of this period of time, the rule normally cannot be renewed. During the time the emergency rule is in effect, the agency can pursue the usual methods of rulemaking. Emergency rulemaking should not be exercised unless absolutely necessary. Notes: NONCOMPLIANCE ISSUES Alabama has a training manual for the state regulatory boards and commissions. That manual sets out a number of frequent noncompliance issues. The manual explains: \"a review of past legal compliance reports and sunset review reports, reveals that instances of noncompliance have a history of repeating.\" Department of Examiners of Public Accounts, Training Manual for Alabama Regulatory Boards and Commissions, 1st Ed. April 2002. The following is a list of the most common noncompliance issues set out in the manual: 15 Reasonable (advance) public notice of meetings was not given. Improper use of executive session(s). Meetings held by conference call. Minutes of all meetings were not taken. Minutes were not signed. Minutes did not reflect individual votes. Minutes were not approved. Incorrect travel expense reimbursement. Inadequate segregation of duties. Inadequate documentation associated with receipts and/or disbursements. Noncompliance with the Alabama Competitive Bid Law. Charging fees not authorized by law (most frequent enlargement of law issue) Failure to maintain a receipt log and failure to reconcile the receipt log to deposits. Failure to deposit receipts in a timely manner. Non-authorized purchases or purchases not allowed by law. Inaccuracy of recorded leave accrual start dates of employees. Improper accountability for annual, sick, personal and compensatory leave balances. Failure to require a Social Security Number on licensee forms. Inadequate procedures to insure that agency maintains documentation of each licensee's compliance with requirements necessary to do business in Alabama, including paying fees. Failure to obtain and implement a State Records Commission-approved Records Disposition Authority. Implementation of policies that are rules without complying with the Administrative Procedure Act. Charging fees in excess of reasonable cost of copying public records. Inadequate controls over property. 16 Noncompliance with submission of property inventory listings to the State Auditor's Office as required. Failure to send annual reports to the Governor and/or other officials. Failure to establish a recycling program 17 ADJUDICATION The second major function of any administrative agency is adjudication. The subject matter as regards adjudication can vary and does not always involve disciplinary actions. On many occasions decisions that agencies make, if contested by an aggrieved party, become adjudicatory in nature. Denial of an application for initial licensure is a prime example. When this happens, the contested case provisions of most administrative procedure acts are triggered. Contested Cases In the administrative procedure acts of all jurisdictions, there are provisions that instruct the agency on how it must proceed to adjudicate an issue, whether it be the attainment of appropriate educational credentials or a license revocation. Typical provisions tell the agency what it must do in terms of notice, pleadings, and proceedings leading to a formal resolution of the issue at hand. The steps to be taken are in many ways similar to the manner in which an agency must promulgate its rules. Assessing Candidates for Initial Licensure The preliminary denial of a initial application for licensure can trigger the contested case provisions of an administrative procedures act. This will only happen, however, on rare occasions. At the same time, assessing candidates' qualifications for initial licensure is an important part of the life of a regulatory board and its members. With some professions, the education, training and examinations required for initial licensure are so standardized that these functions are handled completely by staff persons. With smaller agencies in other professions where education and training is less standardized, some of these responsibilities lie with individual board members. PAUSE YOUR DISCUSSIONS AT THIS POINT AND ASK STAFF TO DISCUSS THE QUALIFICATIONS FOR LICENSURE IN THE JURISDICTION AND THE WAY IN WHICH THOSE QUALIFICATIONS ARE ASSESSED. Notes: 18 Each board member should satisfy himself/herself that the methods used to assess qualifications for initial licensure are rigorous enough to protect the public and at the same time altogether fair to the applicant. It should be noted that at this point in time, due to the passage of the Americans With Disabilities Act, there is an ongoing legal debate regarding the ability of boards to inquire into applicants past problems with alcohol, drugs and/or emotional or mental illness. PAUSE YOUR DISCUSSIONS AND ASK COUNSEL TO PROVIDE THE PARTICIPANTS WITH THE LATEST ON THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT AND APPLICATIONS FOR AN INITIAL LICENSE. Notes: Informal Resolution of Complaints Every administrative procedure act recognizes the fact that not every complaint or dispute involving a regulatory board requires the formal process that results in a hearing under the contested case provisions of the act. Consequently, each APA contains a method by which these matters can be settled informally. In many ways the word informal is a poor one. Complaints settled informally still involve legal documents that outline rights and responsibilities and contain appropriate waivers. Some APA's refer to settlement by stipulation, consent order or similar words or phrases. Most informal resolutions involve allegations of professional misconduct. However, some such resolutions involve applicants that are licensed on probation due to prior problems with drugs, alcohol or other chemical substances. PAUSE YOUR DISCUSSIONS AND ASK COUNSEL TO DETAIL THE STEPS LEADING TO THE INFORMAL SETTLEMENT OF A COMPLAINT AND TO USE SAMPLES OF LEGAL DOCUMENTS TO ILLUSTRATE THESE COMMENTS: Notes: 19 Disciplinary Actions for Alleged Professional Misconduct While it is sad, it is also true that every year there are thousands of violations of state and provincial practice acts that lead to complaints and to disciplinary actions. Larger agencies typically employ trained investigators to investigate these complaints and work with agency attorneys to draft statements of charges and notice of hearings. In some jurisdictions with some agencies, formal hearings are heard by hearing officers who draft findings of fact, conclusions of law and recommended orders that are reviewed and either accepted or rejected by the boards themselves. In some jurisdictions, with some agencies, boards hear the cases themselves and utilize the services of a hearing officer to rule on evidentiary matters and other legal issues. And, in some jurisdictions, with some agencies, some boards hear cases and the presiding officer of the board actually serves as the hearing officer. Regardless of which model is used to adjudicate, a final order must be produced. The final order will include findings of fact, conclusions of law and a order either dismissing the case or imposing sanctions. PAUSE YOUR DISCUSSIONS AND HAVE COUNSEL DISCUSS ANY NUANCES IN YOUR JURISDICTION'S STATUTE OR CASE LAW THAT AFFECT THE PRECEDING GENERAL INSTRUCTION. ASK COUNSEL TO COMMENT ON THE FOLLOWING ASPECTS OF THE DISCIPLINARY PROCESS AND TO ILLUSTRATE THOSE COMMENTS WITH SAMPLES OF RELEVANT LEGAL DOCUMENTS: 1. The manner in which cases are investigated. 2. The scope of pre-hearing discovery in your jurisdiction. 3. The procedure for notifying respondents and proceeding to hearing. 4. The burden of proof in disciplinary cases and any statute of limitations. 5. The way in which cases are tried including the roles of the prosecutor and the hearing officer. 6. The decision making process. 7. The contents and preparation of the final order. 8. Any other responsibilities of the agency including making orders public and providing an index. Notes: 20 AGENCY AND THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT A professional regulatory board is an agency that operates within the executive branch of government. It has a relationship with the legislative and judicial branches, but also with other agencies within the executive branch. Relationship to Other Executive Agencies Any professional regulatory board is only one of numerous state/provincial agencies; it has to operate in cooperation with certain other agencies. For example, the board's primary counsel will undoubtedly be the Attorney General. A good working relationship with the staff of that agency is critical. The need to cooperate with other agencies can be said of several other agencies such as the State Auditor's Office, the Examiners of Public Accounts, the Secretary of State, and the Legislative Fiscal Office. Board members and staff should know and understand the inter-relationship between the agencies and strive toward a successful, collaborative relationship. Attorney General: In many jurisdictions, an Assistant Attorney General will be assigned to represent the board. A good working relationship is crucial. Often important opinions on legal issues will be requested from the Attorney General; the content can be most critical. Auditors: Virtually every jurisdiction will be audited at least annually by the appropriate state/provincial auditors or examiners of public accounts. Board members should closely supervise staff functions involving governmental funds. Budgetary Process: There is considerable variance in how boards receive their annual funding. Some receive an annual appropriation from their state/provincial legislature; other boards have access to the funds generated from renewals, application fees, and exam fees. Ethics Commission: Many jurisdictions have ethics laws that relate to the activities of board members and public employees. If such statutes, particularly those involving use of public monies and/or equipment are violated, reports must be made to the appropriate individuals or entities. PAUSE YOUR DISCUSSIONS AND HAVE STAFF EXPLAIN THE BOARD'S RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER EXECUTIVE AGENCIES. Notes: 21 THE AGENCY AND THE LEGISLATURE Lawmaking Most state/provincial legislatures are designed similarly to the United States Congress in a bicameral manner. The larger chamber in numerical terms, is typically called the House, while the smaller chamber is often referred to as the Senate. (The nomenclature will differ in Canadian jurisdictions.) While the rules of legislative operation vary from state to state, there are a number of commonalities which can be discussed. A law or statute begins as a bill, introduced in either or both the House or Senate. In both chambers the procedures are likely to be identical. First the bill is read and sent to a committee. This is a very important step in the process. Assignment to the appropriate committee can insure a favorable report, whereas assignment to another committee may result in defeat. The committee room is where the bill must gain momentum or fall by the wayside. There it can be favorably reported and move on its way; it can be amended; it can be indefinitely postponed and thereby killed; and perhaps worst of all, it can languish and never be brought up for a vote. When the bill is favorably reported from committee, it will be read for a second time and placed on the calendar of that chamber. If it has been reported in a form acceptable to its sponsors, they will attempt to move it toward a vote. This is not as simple as it sounds, and here the more technical legislative rules come into play. On the first day of the regular session of any legislature, hundreds, maybe a thousand bills are introduced, read and assigned to committees. A proportionate number of these bills will be reported from committee following their initial meetings. Committees report to the Speaker or Lieutenant Governor in a particular order, normally the financial committees first, then the judiciary committees and on down the line. The bills are placed on the calendar in the same order in which they are reported. If the committee to which your bill was assigned reports tenth, even if it's unopposed in committee, it may take its place on the calendar behind a hundred other bills. You can imagine the effect of a week or two weeks' delay caused by requests for public hearings on the bill. Once it is placed that far down the calendar, its only hope is with the Rules Committee. That committee determines the priority of bills when the regular calendar is abandoned and a special order calendar adopted, and that calendar is likely to change every day according to the wishes of the hierarchy. In any event, assuming the bill comes out of committee, takes its place on the calendar and proceeds to a vote, a number of other things can happen. Again, it can be passed or killed, amended or substituted, or carried over to languish and die. Assuming it passes, it will be transmitted to the other chamber and go through the same process. It will be read, sent to committee if reported favorably, then read again and placed on that chamber's calendar. If it is ultimately voted on and passed in the form it came over in, then it will go to the governor for his signature or veto. If it has been amended, it most probably will go to a conference committee composed of small groups of senators and representatives appointed by the Speaker or Lt. Governor. If the bill can be agreed upon by the conferees prior to the adjournment of the legislature sine die, then it will pass in the agreed upon version and go to the Governor for his signature or possible veto. 22 Most board members are terribly naive about legislative matters. They tend to think that because their particular bill is meritorious that it should pass without objection. They fail to understand that just because they care about a change in licensing law does not mean that anyone else will care, particularly a state, territorial or provincial legislator. Therein lies the key to successful passage of bills. Without a sponsor who is dedicated to working a bill through to final passage, the measure is probably doomed. Simply agreeing to sponsor a bill, for most legislators, means very little and you should understand that early on. Most legislators do understand the word commitment, but alas, most board members do not. If involved in legislative activity, don't assume anything. If a legislator commits to vote for a bill in committee, don't assume she'll vote for it on the floor. Ask her and see. Get her full commitment or find out why she's not willing to give you that. Whatever you do, don't ignore the leadership. A bill that matters to only a few people has very little chance generally, but if it matters to the Speaker or Lt. Governor, its chances improve measurably. Of course, the Governor must be considered also. In most states, he/she has veto power requiring an overriding vote of both chambers. The Governor also has the authority to attach executive amendments which could aid or destroy your efforts so his/her office should not be ignored. PAUSE YOUR GENERAL DISCUSSIONS AND ASK STAFF TO REVIEW ANY KNOWN LEGISLATION YOUR BOARD WILL BE ASKED TO RESPOND TO IN THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE. Notes: Sunset Review Sunset legislation is currently in existence in thirty-plus states of the United States. Statutes vary in form but almost all require automatic termination of state administrative boards and agencies unless the state legislature votes to continue their existence. Normally, a board is notified well in advance of its termination date and informed as to the review procedure. Moreover, it has happened that administrative agencies have not been notified in sufficient time to prepare adequately for sunset review. Consequently, all boards should immediately determine when their sunset review date is and begin to prepare for that review. Perhaps the most important part of Sunset Review is understanding the legislature and the sunset review process. First, it is extremely political in nature as most legislators view sunset as a way of making points with the electorate by reducing state government. To be successful in sunset review, board members have to become politically aware, if not politically active. To do 23 this, they should determine who the Sunset Committee members are and in particular the chairperson or chairpersons of the committee. They should actively seek to determine what the Sunset Committee members are really searching for during the review process. Do they want to know how much money state boards are spending and whether their budgets are too large, or are they utilizing sunset review as an effort to gain some form of executive reorganization? The best source to utilize in obtaining this information is the Sunset Committee staff which is normally charged with the responsibility of compiling reports on all agencies reviewed by the Sunset Committee. The staff is extremely important and its determination may be critical to the success of your board. If a formal staff person is not assigned to a sunset committee for compiling such data, you might inquire with your state Examiners of Public Accounts. Almost certainly there will be an audit conducted prior to sunset review, and this may in some states be the staff assistance provided to the committee. The audit is the key document in the sunset review process. It can make or break the efforts of the agency. Each board must be prepared to defend criticisms within the audit, criticisms which may be leveled by auditors who have little or no understanding of the professions they are reviewing. It is probable, and you should expect the sunset audit to draw critical conclusions, sometimes unsupported by logic or explanatory data. Dealing with such a document is difficult, but even more difficult is obtaining it in sufficient time for rebuttal. The auditor's deadline relates only to the sunset hearing, not to any opportunity for rebuttal of illogical conclusions. You may find the newspaper has a copy before you do. Plan for such possibilities and insist on a chance to rebut the auditor's conclusions. Use any political muscle you can to force the audit into the open in sufficient time for you to prepare to respond. To successfully survive the sunset process, boards must be prepared for their sunset review. In that regard, it is advisable that every board, far in advance of its review date, have a pre-sunset meeting and an extensive self-evaluation session. Some points that boards should consider are: 1. Is the board in harmony with its state association and/or boards with overlapping jurisdiction? Some boards have been sunsetted because of internal dissension among the practicing professionals within the jurisdiction. And, while the board is clearly autonomous from the professional association, it is good to know where criticism will come from. Additionally, a board would be well advised to know in advance if problems exist with other regulated professions and their respective boards. 2. Each board should be prepared to report to the Sunset Committee about consumer complaints that it has received. It is very important that legislators understand the severity of problems with unauthorized and unqualified practitioners. A board might make itself some points for budget hearings in this regard if it can show that more enforcement is needed rather than a cutback. 24 3. A board should be prepared to explain questions relative to limiting competition and should be prepared to answer questions regarding application denials and the reasons for such. It should be prepared to explain the standards for licensure; any uniformity that it can point to with the neighboring states would be helpful. Additionally, each board should be prepared to explain any exemptions in the law and the pros and cons of such exemptions. Knowledge of the board's own practice act is imperative, and the board's spokespersons should be prepared to explain all of its rules and regulations and any prohibitions that it may have on advertising, corporate practice or the like. Information on any disciplinary actions which can be released should be released as evidence of the board's on-going efforts to protect the public. Be cautious in this regard lest you release something that is privileged information. 4. Each board must know its opposition. If allied professions have previously sought licensure status and been unsuccessful in that regard, they may view sunset as a way of accomplishing their goal in another manner. If there have been extensive conflicts with other professions, then the board should be prepared to defend the stand it took. A board would be well advised to consult with the staff of the sunset committee in advance of its hearing to determine if any witnesses are going to appear from out-of-state. It is not unlikely that some member of a consumer group or other individuals will be prepared to appear at a sunset hearing and speak against the continuation of the board. 5. The question of whether a board could/should be merged with another board is likely to come up. Those members present for sunset review should be able to explain what effect it would have on the quality of services if the board is merged with another board and what problems could arise. 6. Each board should be prepared to justify and explain its budget in detail. If its funds are separate and distinct from the state's General Fund, a justification should be ready. If the board is responsible for continuing education and is pursuing its implementation actively, this can be an important point to make during sunset review. 7. One potential point of concern is the question of equal employment opportunities. The board should have some facts and figures readily available on the number of minority applicants, the number licensed and the number refused, as well as, the reason for refusing these applicants. 8. The board should be prepared to explain and defend its application and exam procedures. If complaints have been received about the length of time required for processing and the number of individuals refused or having failed the exam, sufficient explanation should be prepared well in advance of the sunset hearing. 9. Spokespersons for the board should also be prepared to explain, and if necessary to defend, expenditures for out-of-state travel. A few \"Do's\" and \"Don'ts\" might be of some help: Things to DO in regard to your actual sunset hearing: 25 1. DO attend another board's sunset review hearing in advance of your board's review date and observe the sunset review process. The lessons learned by observing other boards in the process can be extremely helpful. 2. DO determine the review authority of the sunset committee and have the board's attorney review any requests for confidential information. He/She should also prepare a list of cases to substantiate your legal authority to regulate the profession. 3. DO compute the value of donated time and be prepared to report on whether or not a state supported super board could replace similar type boards. 4. DO create an office procedures manual if you have not already done so and have it available for the sunset committee staff and the committee. 5. DO document the work that you have done so that nothing is left to the imagination. 6. DO have a good attitude about sunset as it can be very helpful in increasing the effectiveness of the board. A few things that you DON'T want to do in regard to a sunset hearing: 1. DON'T forget your sunshine law if one exists in your state. If you have to have a meeting to prepare for sunset review with other boards or with the sunset staff or with the state association, you may have to give notice to the public in advance of the hearing. 2. DON'T tell the sunset review committee that your profession is unique. Sunset committees no longer accept this rationale for non-conference to statutory mandates. 3. DON'T forget the Governor's office. In all but one state of the Union, the Governor has veto power over legislation and his/her office should not be ignored. Remember that a Governor can refuse to sign a continuation bill passed by the House and Senate and eliminate an agency in this manner. Notes: Legislative Questions Sunset hearings in all jurisdictions are preceded by a lengthy audit. Invariably, questions are put to boards with instructions to answer same in accordance with published criteria and standards. A typical example is set out below. FOR ESTABLISHED PROFESSIONS, THESE QUESTIONS MAY SEEM SUPERFLUOUS, BUT THEY DO RAISE REGULATORY CONSCIOUSNESS. 26 1. Criteria And Standards: A. A profession or occupation shall be regulated by the state only when: (a) It can be demonstrated that the unregulated practice of the profession or occupation can clearly harm or endanger the health, safety or welfare of the public, and the potential for the harm is recognizable and not remote or speculative. (b) The public can reasonably be expected to benefit from an assurance of initial continuing professional ability. (c) The public cannot be effectively protected by other means. B. After evaluating the criteria in subsection A of this section and considering governmental and societal costs and benefits, if the legislature finds that it is necessary to regulate a profession or occupation, the least restrictive method of regulation shall be imposed, consistent with the public interest and this section: (a) If existing common law and statutory civil remedies and criminal sanctions are insufficient to reduce or eliminate existing harm, regulation should occur through enactment of stronger civil remedies and criminal sanctions. (b) If a professional or occupational service involves a threat to the public and the service is performed primarily through business entities or facilities that are not regulated, the business entity or the facility should be regulated rather than its employee practitioners. (c) If the threat to the public health, safety or welfare including economic welfare is relatively small, regulation should be through a system of registration. (d) If the consumer may have a substantial interest in relying on the qualifications of the practitioner, regulation should be through a system of certification. (e) If it is apparent that the public cannot be adequately protected by any other means, a system of licensure should be imposed. C. Any of the issues set forth in subsections 1A and 1B of this section and section 2 below may be considered in terms of their application to professions and occupations generally. 2. Information Requested: Prior to review under this chapter and prior to consideration by the legislature of any bill which proposes to regulate a profession or occupation, the profession or occupation being reviewed or seeking regulation shall explain each of the following factors: A. Why regulation is necessary including: (a) The nature of the potential harm or threat to the public if the profession or occupation is not regulated. (b) Specific examples of the harm or threat identified in subsection (a). (c) The extent to which consumers will benefit from a method of regulation which permits identification of competent practitioners, indicating typical 27 employers, if any, of practitioner. B. The extent to which practitioners are autonomous, as indicated by: (a) The degree to which the profession or occupation requires the use of independent judgment, and the skill or experience required in making such judgment. (b) The degree to which practitioners are supervised. C. The efforts that have been made to address the concerns that give rise to the need for regulation including: (a) Voluntary efforts, if any, by members of the profession or occupation to: (1) Establish a code of ethics. (2) Help resolve disputes between practitioners and consumers. (b) Recourse to and the extent of use of existing law. D. Why the alternatives to licensure specified in this subsection would not be adequate to protect the public interest: (a) Stronger civil remedies or criminal sanctions. (b) Regulation of the business or facility providing the service rather than the employee practitioners. (c) Regulation of the program or service rather than the individual practitioners. (d) Registration of all practitioners. (e) Certification of practitioners. (f) Other alternatives. E. The benefit to the public if regulation is granted including: (a) How regulation will result in reduction or elimination of the harms or threats identified under subsection A of this section. (b) The extent to which the public can be confident that a practitioner is competent. (1) Whether the registration, certification or licensure will carry an expiration date. (2) Whether renewal will be asked only upon payment of a fee, or whether renewal will involve reexamination, peer review, or other enforcement. (3) The standards of registration, certification, or licensure as compared with the standards of other jurisdictions. (4) The nature and duration of the educational requirement, if any, including, but not limited to, whether such educational program includes a substantial amount of supervised field experience; whether educational programs exist in this state; whether there will be an experience requirement; whether the experience must be acquired under a registered, certified, or licensed practitioner; whether there are alternative routes of 28 entry or methods of satisfying the eligibility requirements and qualifications; whether all applicants will be required to pass an examination; and, if an examination is required, by whom it will be developed and how the costs of development will be met. F. The form and powers of the regulatory entity including: (a) Whether the regulatory entity is or would be a board composed of members of the profession or occupation and public members, or a state agency, or both, and if appropriate, their respective responsibilities in administering the system of registration, certification or licensure. (b) The composition of the board, if any, and the number of public members, if any. (c) The powers and duties of the board of state agency regarding examinations. (d) The system for receiving complaints and taking disciplinary action against practitioners. G. The extent to which regulation might harm the public including: (a) Whether regulation will restrict entry into the profession or occupation: (1) Whether the standards are the least restrictive necessary to insure safe and effective performance. (2) Whether persons who are registered, certified or licensed in a jurisdiction which the board or agency believes has requirements that are substantially equivalent to those of this state will be eligible for endorsement or some form of reciprocity. (b) Whether there are similar professions or occupations which should be included, or portions of the profession or occupation which should be excluded from regulation. H. How the standards of the profession or occupation will be maintained: (a) Whether effective quality assurance standards exist in the profession or occupation, such as legal requirements associated with specific programs that define or enforce standards, or a code of ethics. (b) How the proposed form of regulation will assure quality: (1) The extent to which a code of ethics, if any, will be adopted. (2) The grounds for suspension, revocation, or refusal to renew registration, certification or licensure. I. A profile of the practitioners in this state, including a list of associations, organizations, and other groups representing the practitioners including an estimate of the number of practitions in each group. J. The effect that registration, certification or licensure will have on the costs of the services to the public. 29 PAUSE YOUR GENERAL DISCUSSIONS AND DETERMINE WHAT PLANS YOUR BOARD NEEDS TO MAKE REGARDING SUNSET REVIEW. Notes: THE AGENCY AND THE JUDICIAL PROCESS Litigation Lawsuits are commonplace within the world of professional regulation. They can and are filed for a variety of reasons; i.e., admission to exams, to challenge actions taken by boards, to block disciplinary efforts, and so forth. Boards themselves are finding that oftentimes they must initiate litigation in order to effect their own purposes. Just what is litigation? Basically it involves disputes which are properly resolvable by a court of law. There are different types of litigation. This section of the manual is devoted to suits that are not appeals from agency decisions. There are certain basic phases of a lawsuit that all board members should be acquainted with. The first phase can be referred to as the pleadings phase of the suit. A lawsuit begins with the filing of a complaint or petition which sets out the activity complained of, the grounds for relief, and the damages to which the person may be entitled. The person filing the lawsuit is normally referred to as the plaintiff, complainant, or petitioner. Those who must defend the suit are normally referred to as the defendants or respondents. When the lawsuit is filed, an accompanying document called a summons is also prepared. That document, along with a copy of the complaint, is served on each individual who is named as a defendant. The summons gives notice to the defending party as to the plaintiff's name, the court in which the case has been filed, and most importantly, the date by which a responsive pleading is required. It is not unusual for a board member to be sued and consequently receive a summons and complaint. When and if this happens, contact counsel immediately because the time for responding begins to run from the date you are served. The responsive pleadings are normally either a motion to dismiss and/or motion for summary judgment or an answer. Motions to dismiss or for summary judgment are pleadings which are designed to end the litigation without trial based on the law alone. An answer is exactly that. It is the defendant's response by which he admits or denies any wrongdoing and/or liability. There are a number of other documents which may be filed within the pleading phase of the lawsuit, but are more technical than the intent of this manual. The next phase of a lawsuit is the \"discovery\" phase. It is aptly named because each party to the lawsuit, during this phase, attempts to discover what the other's case actually is. This is a step forward from the old days when surprise at trial was the rule, rather than the exception. The rules of civil procedure, which have been enacted in most states now, are designed so that 30 theoretically there are no surprises at the time of trial. This is done in an effort to more equitably serve the rights of the parties. During the discovery each side may utilize various techniques designed to uncover facts and expose weaknesses and strengths of the respective parties. The two most important tools in discovery are written interrogatories and depositions. Written interrogatories are questions propounded to parties which they are required to answer under oath. This is the least expensive form of discovery, but can only be served on other parties. A deposition may be utilized with parties and other witnesses. A deposition is basically a question and answer session involving the prospective witness, counsel for both sides and a court reporter who takes the sworn testimony of the deponent. This discovery tool is used not only to discover the alleged facts of the case, but to preserve testimony which may be used at trial if the witness is unavailable and to observe the demeanor of the potential witness. Should you ever have to answer interrogatories, you will be able to utilize the assistance of counsel in formulating responses. They are questions which must be answered truthfully, and the individual answering the question must so affirm or swear as to their truthfulness. A deposition can be a very effective tool for a litigant since it allows a party to assess the witness' ability to testify, and it provides a fertile ground for producing inconsistent statements that my prove to weaken that side's case. You should never let your deposition be taken without advising your attorney. It is a common ploy of many lawyers to initiate such a lawsuit against a party who will ultimately be dismissed from the case when other parties are added. In the meantime, the party filing the suit, prior to adding the additional parties, will already have noticed and taken the depositions of future parties who unknowingly submit to the deposition without the advice of their attorneys. Discovery is the phase of the lawsuit which takes the longest period of time, and it can go on seemingly forever. It is expensive and time consuming, but it is an absolute necessity if a case is to be tried properly. The next phase of litigation is the trial of the case itself. The party which filed the lawsuit has the burden of going forward with the evidence and proving its case by a preponderance of the evidence. Trials are basically of two types: jury trials and non-jury trials. Compared to jury trials, non-jury trials are quick and relatively simple. The trial judge's responsibilities create the differences. In a jury trial, the judge must be very careful to shield the jury from inadmissible evidence. When a judge sits alone, he can simply disregard improper evidence; further, there is no necessity for written or oral jury charges. Everything has advantages and disadvantages though. So far as decision making goes, juries are much faster than judges, as cases can be taken under advisement for long periods of time. A typical trial of either sort would begin with an opening statement from both plaintiff and defendant. This phase is for the purpose of advising the court or jury of what each side expects to prove from the evidence. This exchange is followed by the plaintiff's case in chief. Evidence is elicited through oral testimony and physical exhibits. Each side has, of course, the opportunity to cross-examine the other side's witnesses following its direct examination. 31 After the plaintiff rests, defense counsel will ordinarily move for a directed verdict. If the plaintiff has produced substantial evidence on each element of his claim, this motion will be denied and the defense will put on its case in the same manner as the plaintiff did. Following the close of the defendant's case, the plaintiff is normally allowed to call any rebuttal witness. The case then goes to the jury following the court's oral charge, or is taken under submission by the trial judge. When a decision is made, various motions may be filed and an appeal may be taken. Appeals are costly, time consuming, and involve the transcription of the record, briefs and argument of counsel. Some appeals may be directly to the highest court of the jurisdiction, while others may lie to an intermediate court. The difference in trial and appeal is principally the manner of presentation of the case. On appeal, evidence is presented through the record made in trial court, and arguments by counsel are limited to written briefs and short oral arguments. Review by the appellate court is for the most part limited to alleged error at the trial stage, although occasionally other issues may be considered. Cases can also remain on appeal for long periods of time, and swift decisions should not be expected. When a decision is made, the appellate court may affirm the lower court's decision, affirm in part and reverse in part, reverse for a new trial or reverse and render. PAUSE YOUR DISCUSSIONS AND ASK COUNSEL TO COMMENT ON THE BOARD'S ROLE IN ANY CURRENT LITIGATION THAT INVOLVES THE AGENCY. Appeals from Agency Decisions Virtually any contested case can result in a decision adverse to a party that can be appealed to a court of general jurisdiction. These \"appeals\" are lawsuits, but they differ markedly from the other type of lawsuits discussed above. Appeals of agency decisions are usually confined to the review of the record of the proceedings that resulted in the agency's decision. In most such appeals the reviewing court is bound to affirm if there is substantial evidence that the agency's decision was correct and not arbitrary or capricious. The reviewing court will also consider challenges to the fairness of the process the board used to reach its decision. Many of the appeals from disciplinary cases involve the adjudication process and situations in which boards disagreed with recommendations made by hearing officers. PAUSE YOUR DISCUSSIONS AND HAVE COUNSEL EXPLAIN THE BOARD'S AUTHORITY TO OVERRULE A HEARING OFFICER'S RECOMMENDATIONS AND THE PROPER WAY TO DO SO. Notes: 32 Liability There are several types of liability which board members should be aware of. First is the liability of the board itself for injunctive relief. Basically there are two types of injunctive relief: mandatory or prohibitory. These are remedies requiring defendants to do or refrain from doing particular acts. In some states, other proceedings may be called by other names, such as writ or mandamus or prohibition, but the results are similar in nature. Injunctive type relief in state court is the least troublesome type of liability since it lies directly against the agency and rarely involves damages or attorney's fees. Other types of liability -- for actual damages, for misconduct or violation of an individual's civil rights -- are far more intimidating. Of particular concern are the far reaching aspects of 42 U.S.C. \u00a71983, et seq., which assess attorney fees almost automatically against unsuccessful litigants even if only injunctive relief has been secured. A board member who cannot bear the threat of litigation needs to resign immediately for his/her own well-being and that of the board. Threats of lawsuits are commonplace, even everyday events for many boards. The handful of suits that do occur are vexious and time consuming. But, liability is not common. There are many defenses to such actions, particularly if the lawsuit involves the exercise of the board's adjudicative function. In fact, when exercising this function there is significant case law that holds that board members are absolutely immune from liability. Hicks v. Georgia Board of Pharmacy, 553 F.Supp. 314 (N.D.Ga. 1982); Bettencourt v. Board of Reg. in Medicine, 904 F.2d 772 (1st Cir.1990); Watts v. Burkhart, 978 F.2d 269 (6th Cir. 1992); O'Neal v. Mississippi Board of Nursing, 113 F.3d 62 (5th Cir. 1996); and Wang v. New Hampshire Board of Registration in Medicine, 55 F.3d 698 (1st Cir. 1995). But see also: Lapides v. of Regents, 122 S.Ct. 1640 (2002); Edwards v. Gerstein, 237 SW 3d 580 (MO.banc 2007). Most state governments have insurance protection that extends to members of professional regulatory boards. However, staff is responsible for compliance with the various regulations that make this coverage available. Make sure these regulations are followed to the letter. Many jurisdictions have statutes that also provide immunity from civil liability to members of non-profit corporations and \"other such boards and commissions\". If a lawsuit occurs these statute(s) should not be overlooked. Board members and staff should also seek competent advice regarding matters related to use of state equipment and reimbursement for travel expenses. Statutes and rules regarding anything involving state monies should be followed to the letter. PAUSE YOUR DISCUSSIONS AND ASK COUNSEL TO DISCUSS ANY THOUGHTS REGARDING BOARD MEMBER LIABILITY IN YOUR JURISDICTION. 33 Occasionally the threat of antitrust liability is raised. The U.S. courts have spoken to this issue on a number of occasions and the state action immunity doctrine has provided a significant umbrella of protection for agency members. Hoover v. Ronwin, 466 U.S. 558 (1982); Brazil v. Arkansas Bd. of Dental Examiners, 593 F.Supp. 1354 (D.C.Ark.1984); Leigh v. Board of Registration in Nursing, 506 N.E.2d (Miss. 1987); Hass v. Oregon State Bar, 883 F. 2d 1453 (9th Cir. 1989); Otworth v. Supp. (M..D.Fla. 1999); South Carolina State Bd. v. F.T.C., 455 F. 3rd 436 (4th Cir. 2006). Of more concern is the agency's liability for violation of more recently passed laws such as the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA), codified as 42 U.S.C. 12001, et. seq.. This law impacts the manner in which the board assesses initial and current fitness to practice. Doe v. State of Conn., Dept. of Health Services, 75 F. 3rd 81 (2nd Cir. 1996). PAUSE YOUR DISCUSSIONS AND ASK STAFF AND COUNSEL TO DISCUSS COMPLIANCE ISSUES RELATIVE TO THE ADA. Notes: THE AGENCY AND THE PUBLIC While the agency is accountable to the legislature each time sunset review occurs, it must be accountable to the public every day. As many critics of professional regulatory boards quickly point out, the purpose of such regulation is to protect the public, not the professions. Other critics say that it's just as important to protect the public from the regulatory boards. Regardless of the point of view, legislatures have made regulatory agencies accountable in a number of ways. State statutes which typically apply to boards and their members, as well as other agencies and employees, may include a competitive bid law, an ethics act, a freedom of information act and a sunshine law. While discussed earlier, this manual would be incomplete without some formal acknowledgment of those laws that relate to the agency and the public. Freedom of Information Acts (Open Records) A number of jurisdictions may have what is commonly referred to as a Freedom of Information Act. The state/provincial act may predate the federal Freedom of Information Act or may be patterned after it. That particular statute was passed in 1967 and amended in 1974. The Act is codified as part of the Federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 552. Its general purpose is to provide citizens access to public information on the federal level. Of course, this handbook is for members of professional regulatory boards. In that regard, most state statutes include Freedom of Information Act. For more information on state FIOA laws, see Project, Government Information and the Rights of Citizens, 73 Mich.L.Rev. 971 (1975). For those U.S. jurisdictions which do not have a similar statute there is also precedent for common law rights of access to information held by state governments. City of St. Matthews 34 v. Voice of St. Matthews, 519 S.W.2d 811. (KY App. 1974). Sunshine Laws (Open Meetings) This particular type of law which could well be described as an open meeting law, had been enacted in all fifty (50) states of the Union before Congress passed the Federal Government in the Sunshine Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(b). The concept embodied in such laws includes the concept that publicity is a helpful preventive for many of the more common ills of those who govern the public. Sunshine Acts open agency meetings to the public and the press. Violation of such acts, for whatever reason, innocent or not, can prove costly and may result in the invalidation of actions taken at such meetings. Polillo v. Deane, 379 A.2d 211 (N.J. 1977). Invalidation is not the only result. Two others which come to mind are adverse publicity and possible repercussions during sunset hearings. Cantrell v. State Board of Registration, 26 S.W. 3d 824, (Mo. App.W.D. 2000); Commonwealth MA v. Bd. Selectmen Town, No. 062167C (Ma.Super. Oct. 30, 2006). In order to conduct your board meetings properly, be sure to consult with counsel and have counsel extract the relevant Sunshine law from your state code. Make sure that your Executive Secretary is aware of any notice requirements within this statute and the manner in which such notice must be given. At the same time, do not ignore the exceptions found in the Sunshine Act. Invariably there will be exceptions to the general rule which will allow for deliberations behind closed doors. There are ten (10) such categories in the federal statute, and while state statutes will probably not contain so many exceptions, you can be assured that such categories as the character or good name of an individual will be included in many such acts. Careful scrutiny of the act may avoid nasty litigation for defamation, libel or slander. 35 THE AGENCY AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS THAT INTERACT WITH PROFESSIONAL REGULATION Association of State and Provincial Psychology Boards The Association of State and Provincial Psychology Boards is the cumulative body of all state, territorial and provincial boards that regulate the practice of psychology in the U.S. and Canada. Currently, ASPPB has 64 state, territorial and provincial members. ASPPB creates the Examination for Professional Practice in Psychology (EPPP), which is used to assess candidates for licensure in most of the member jurisdictions. ASPPB also takes responsibility for maintaining the disciplinary data bank and for transferring EPPP scores among the jurisdictions. ASPPB holds two membership meetings, one in the fall and one in the early spring. Both meetings have educational components in which both plenary and small group sessions are devoted to licensure, discipline and other regulatory issues. ASPPB also produces many publications that it makes available not only to its own members, but to the public and other interested entities. ASPPB is located at 7177 Halcyon Summit Drive, Montgomery, Alabama 36117. Its web site can be found at http://asppb.org. Citizen Advocacy Center Citizen Advocacy Center (CAC) is a private non-profit organization that provides support and training for public members of professional regulatory boards. CAC also conducts research and sponsors educational conferences on public issues related to health care quality assurance. CAC's address is 1424 16th Street, N.W. #105, Washington, D.C., 20036. Council on Licensure, Enforcement and Regulation Council on Licensure, Enforcement and Regulation (CLEAR) is a non-profit organization that is involved in education and training for those involved in professional regulation. CLEAR sponsors a certification course for agency investigators and educational conferences on both the regional and national levels. CLEAR's address is 201 West Short Street, Lexington, Kentucky, 40509; (606) 231-1892. Federation of Associations of Regulatory Boards Federation of Associations of Regulatory Boards (FARB) is a non-profit organization made up of 12 associations of regulatory boards. FARB sponsors three educational conferences per year including the Annual Forum, Attorney Certification Course and Leadership Conference. Information about FARB can be located at www.farb.org.

NOCA can be reached at 1200 19th Street, N.W., Suite 300, Washington, D.C., 20036-2422; (202) 859-1165. Revised: April 14, 2016 1 Part One Explain what measures your organization takes to ensure that any third - party organization that it relies upon to make an assessment: 1. Provides information about assessment practices to applicant Applicants can find most information about the WES process through the WES website. This includes information about WES services and fees, documentation requirements, and the application process. The o n-line status update feature allows applicants to check on their application status 24 h ours-a-day, 7 -days-a- week , and make changes to their evaluation order . However, many applicants email and call as well. We commit to a 48 hour response time when electronic messages are received. Our dedicated customer service staff is available to answer questions by phon e from 9 AM to 2 PM, and electronically during regular business hours 9:00 AM to 5:00 P M EST; no appointment is required. Applications are available in several ways: on our website through a real -time online application . We acknowledge receipt of applic ation in most cases immediately. In cases if documentation or payment is missing applicants are informed by email or mail (if no email address is available). Through Check Status/Your Account, applicants have 24/7 access to the most up -to-date information about their WES evaluation file. Evaluation results are communicated through hard copy evaluation reports and on -line status update. From 2016, WES has instituted nano -Rep service for its applicants. Nano-Rep is a self -service online customer service experience with large database of common queries with answers. WES nano -Rep is designed to increase customer satisfaction and experience. Through partnership s with the Welcome Centres in Ajax and Pickering, Newcomer Information Centre's Lesmill Social Serv ices and with Newcomer Centre of Peel, WES staff provides in-depth advisement to internationally educate d individuals on their need for evaluation and general licensure processes in Ontario and Canada. 2. Utilizes current and accurate information about q ualifications from outside Canada WES evaluation resources and information are stored in a custom -built database that contains information : 200+ countries and jurisdictions 47,000 institutions 12,000 credentials 2,000 grading scales Revised: April 14, 2016 2 Thus far, in Canada, WES ha s evaluated 483,486 academic credentials . The WES database is controlled and maintained by Policy, Knowledge and Data team , a team of professionals whose duty is to gather, verify and enter information. 3. Provides timely decisions, responses a nd reasons to applicants As a part of the application process, applicants are directed to read about the WES process and about which documents are required for evaluation, in what format and from what source. This information is well -researched and countr y specific. Based on when WES receives all required documents , the time frame to complete an evaluation report is 7 business days. . Any time, prior, throughout the evaluation period, and after it is completed, applicants have an option to enquire about th e process or status of their evaluation through email, phone, review their status through self-directed on-line status update feature . WES is committed to a 48 hour response time for emails received from applicants. On- line status update is available 24- hour-a-day, 7 -days -a-week. Free , web-based self such as grade co nversion guide, iGPA C alculator and Degree Equivalency for over 160 countries are available on WES website and are designed to provide an immediate feedback to applic ants and organizational users about credential(s) in question , including institutional status (e.g., recognized) or its elements before formal evaluation process is completed. 4. Provides training to individuals assessing qualifications Formal in -house trai ning of credential evaluators is conducted under the guidance of the Assistant Director and Manager of Evaluation Services . WES evaluators receive thorough, high quality and systematic training in order to ensure that they produce accurate evaluation repor ts which are consistent with WES's established evaluation policies and current research. In addition, to contribute to overall competency of academic credential evaluators, WES offers free Webinars on best practices in document authentication, education s ystems and evaluation methodologies. The free weekly webinars are complemented with annual in -person training workshops and labs. Furthermore, WES maintains an extensive library of printed and electronic resources. Since 199 8, 1,072,978 evaluation report s have been completed in Canada and the US, and the respective academic records are archived and constitute an important resource that is electronically accessible to evaluators. Revised: April 14, 2016 3 WES publishes WENR (World Education News and Reviews) , a monthly electro nic newsletter, which is distributed to subscribers around the world . It contains news on international trends in education, offers \"how -to\" articles on credential evaluation techniques, and profiles educational systems around the world. Evaluators have access to 21 years of articles and information on international comparative education. 2,749 Canadian professionals are registered users of WENR. WES website contains free Resources , Tools , white papers, etc., for practitioners in international academic credential evaluations . More recently, WES has established a Research and Consulting Services to address the needs of institutions and professional licensing bodies outside of mere evaluation services. 5. Provides access to records related to the assessment to applicants An on-line self-directed status update feature allows applicants to receive information about the evaluation process, including specific details regarding which credentials are being assessed, what documents have been received already and w hat is still required. As the file moves through the process , the status is continuously updated. Each time WES receives academic documents, records are reviewed and applicant is informed of the result of this review by email or mail. Upon completion of ev aluation process evaluation results are posted through on -line status update feature. WES then send s a hard copy of the report to the applicant and an y other recipient(s) of their choice. Additional fees are applicable for extra copies. Upon request, appli cants may have access to records concerning their file stored in WES office. In some such cases, WES might decide to redact certain elements of the documents prior to being shared with the applicant, in order to protect the verification process. WES ' procedures for handling personal information are in accordance with the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Document Act (PIPEDA). 6. Accommodates applicants with special needs, such as visual impairment WES applicants may be accommodated on an indi vidual basis, based on identified needs . The WES office adheres to the requirements of Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA) which took effect on January 2012. All WES Customer Service and Client Relations staff s are trained in AODA requirements . Part Two If your organization relies on a third party to conduct credential assessments: Revised: April 14, 2016 4 1. Explain how the third party determines the level (e.g. baccalaureate, master's, PhD) of the credential presented for assessment and describe the criteria that are applied to determine equivalency The WES credential evaluation methodology is based on the level, scope and intent of the program completed. We consider the admission requirement s to the program, the length of the program, the depth and breadth of the curriculum covered, and the options for further study of the degree holder, when formulating our equivalencies. In addition, we examine the official status of the degree - granting institution and the program in the home country's education system, a s well as any official ratings, when establishing our equivalency. These criteria combine and measure credential and educational systemic features to identify if similarities are adequately substantial to grant a Canadian equivalency. WES evaluation repor ts reflect organizational policy and are not the point of view of individual evaluators. 2. Explain how work experience is taken into account WES doesn't evaluate work experience . Part Three Immigration , Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) and Its Immigration Programs : Federal Skilled Worker Program and Express Entry Program Since April 2013, World Education Services has been one of the designated Education Credential Assessment (ECA) agencies of the Canadian government. All candidates for immi gration are required to provide a credential assessment of their academic credentials. Immigration applicants to WES will receive a modified version of the WES Basic Document -by-Document (ICAP) evaluation report. Applicants for licensure who have recei ved a WES report for immigration purposes need to upgrade their evaluation report to WES standard Document -by-Document or Course -by- Course evaluation report as is required by certain regulators in Canada. WES has streamlined its processes for upgrades on Document -by-Document or Course -by-Course credential evaluation s for a fee of $50 or $100 respectively. The upgrade fee includes assessing any new academic credentials completed while waiting to immigrate to Canada. Professional licensing bodies are enc ouraged to inform licensure candidates of this streamlined WES upgrade service . Revised: April 14, 2016 5 Part Four WES Global Talent Bridge (GTB) Global Talent Bridge is an innovative program dedicated to helping skilled immigrants succeed in Canada. We partner with institutio ns and community -based organizations to help skilled immigrants leverage their education and reach their full career potential. GTB activities include: Direct outreach to skilled immigrants, including seminars and comprehensive online resources Research and policy development at the local, provincial and national level Support, training and resources for community organizations, government agencies and employers To learn more about GTB, visit http://www.wes.org /ca/gtb/ Questions for Third Party Organizations Provide links to policy where possible 1. Do you provide some information about assessment practices to applicant? Yes. Information about CES assessment practices is published on the webpages listed below as well as on the reverse side of each Educational Assessment Report. #1 under the heading \"Authentication, Verification, and Equivalency\". 2. Do you provide timely decisions, responses and reasons to applicants? Yes. Explanations are provided where appropriate. 3. Do you provide training to individuals making assessments , decisions, and/or conducting appeals? CES hires with a preference for individuals who hold a M aster 's degree with research experience. As th ere is no institutional training program for academic credential assessors, we use a type of apprenticeship progr am designed to equip assistant assessors to become qualified to become full assessors. We participate in professional development seminars , workshops are attended periodically and we are active members of credential assessment networks that share informat ion freely. 4. Do you have an internal review/appeal process? As a member of the Alliance of Credential Evaluation Services of Canada, CES undergo es rigorous self-assessment process to ensure that it adheres to the Pan -Canadian Quality Assurance Framewor k for the Assessment of Int ernational Academic Credentials as well as the Recommendation on Criteria and Procedures for the Assessment of Foreign Qualifications adopted under the 1997 Lisbon Recognition Convention. CES also follows established methodology and guidelines that conform to the General Guiding Principles for Good Practice in the Assessment of Foreign Credentials of the Canadian Information Centre for International Credentials (CICIC) and reflect the placement practices of Canadian universities. CES periodically reviews its procedures and policies to maintain transparency, accuracy, consistency, and credibility. This is also to ensure that policies are kept current and fair. All applicants may request an explanation of how their particular outcom e was reached. If an applicant is still not satisfied with the explanation provided by an assessor , the individual can initiate a formal appeal . The appeal must be submitted in writing within 90 days of the date when the report was issued. In the appeal l etter, the applicant is expected to indicate the reasons for disagreeing with the outcome and also provide documentation that supports his/her claims. The appeal will be reviewed by the senior assessor. The client is notified of the outcome of the review i n writing . The fee for the appeal is $199 , which should be included with the appeal letter. If the appeal is successful, a revised assessment report will be issued and the $199 fee will be refunded. Information on the appeal process is available at http://learn.utoronto.ca/international - professionals/comparative -education #8 and #9 5. What i s your process regarding access to records related to assessment of applicants? CES abides by the University of Toronto 's privacy and access policies as outlined by the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA). Information can be found at: http://www.fippa.utoronto.ca/about.htm Applicants' records are not disclosed to third parties without applicants' written authorization . To facilitate the process, applicants can complete a form available online at: http://learn.utoronto.ca/wp -content/uploads/2014/10/Release if applicants' documents are found to be falsified or fraudulent, other credential assessment agencies and related Government officials will be notified. Applicants are required to read and agree to the CES terms and conditions before submitting an application. 6. Explain how you determine the level of credential presented for assessment, and describe the criteria that are applied to determine equivalency. The general practice of CES is to view the qualification being processed in terms of the whole educational system of a country and provide a comparison to a credential taken at a Canadian institution. The following factors are taken into consideration: Official s tatus of institution/authority issuing the educational credential, country (including state, province, etc.) in which the institution/authority issued the credential and the year in which the credential was earned. We determine if the institution was authorized to deliver the level of education in its own country during the time when the client completed his/her studies. In some countries, a separate accreditation process may have been established for private institutions or individual programs. In such a case, it has to be determined whether the institution or program was prope rly accredited during the period of client's study . CES assessors and assistant assessors generally use materials in our in -house library, in -house database, external databases, precedents, and official websites respectively to check institution and pro gram status. When such information is not available through our regular sources, inquiry letters will be sent to the institution and/or appropriate authorities. CES staff will also confer with experts in other credential assessment agencies and/or experts in the education system of the cou ntry of the issuing institution; Regular admission requirements for entrance to the program ; Level of the program of study within the education system in which the educational credential was earned and the nature of t he training; Credit requirements for graduation; Official duration on a full -time basis ; Objective of the program of study in the country ; The collected data described above will be used to draw a comparison between the content of an educational pro gram from outside of Canada to a Canadian educational credentia l. The comparison is made by: using as a benchmark the Canadian educational credential that most closely corresponds to the program of study completed outside Canada; s ome of the main resour ces are the Universities Canada's online database of Canadian university study programs ( http://www.universitystudy.ca/search -programs/ ) and the Ontario colleges' website (http://www.ontariocolleges.ca/home ) checking the placement recommendations of the Canadian institutions of higher education for a par ticular educational credential expressing in terms of years of study the equivalent le ngth of the program. The duration of study is taken into consideration but it is not the only factor used to determine the outcome. The program content and design are taken into consideration juxtaposing field of study to educational level. Assessors con firm that a certain major is offered at a given educational level. For example, a Bachelor of Arts degree, majoring in Psychology (http://oraweb.aucc.ca/pls/dcu/dcu_e2?REF_ID=1220 421&SORT_BY=1 ) consulting internal policy manual and precedent cases recorded in the CES database, and deciding whether the pre cedent is valid for application.
