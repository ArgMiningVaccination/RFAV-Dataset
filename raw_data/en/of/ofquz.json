W e will celebrate successes and recognize accomplishments to motivate all Albertans to participate in making Alberta a better place for children to live, learn, and grow O F Contents Alberta's Promise is a movement by caring community partners to create opportunities for our children to be successful, healthy and happy. Alberta's Promise was founded on the belief that it takes an entire community working together to do the best job of raising our children. The formation of Alberta's Promise was announced in April 2003 and was introduced into the legislature as Bill One - the Premier's Council on Alberta's Promise Act. Alberta's Promise is a made-in-Alberta version of a promise initiative rst launched in the United States as America's Promise. Alberta, with the Premier's Council on Alberta's Promise Act, is the rst jurisdiction in Canada to enshrine the Promise initiative in legislation.AL B E R TA 'S Promise Alberta's Promise builds upon the community's desire to support child and youth programs by encouraging companies, foundations and service clubs to form partnerships. Alberta's Promise serves as a link between agencies and the giving community. Alberta's Promise is not involved in fund development nor does the organization deliver programs directly to children and youth or make direct matches between Alberta's Promise partners. 45 The Alberta's Promise Premier's Council is made up of a 70-member volunteer board of community leaders. Premier Ralph Klein is the Chair and Colleen Klein is the Honourary Chair of the Alberta's Promise Council. The Council works towards mobilizing the corporate sector and the community to form partnerships with charitable organizations that provide programs and services to children and youth. OU R S H A R E DPromise6 It is our responsibility to make sure our children's needs are met. By pulling together, we can ensure a healthy and safe environment and encourage Alberta's children and youth to become involved and active members of our society. The result will be a brighter future for all of Alberta's children for generations to come. It all starts now.AL B E R TA 'S F I V E Promises7 Promise One - Providing a Healthy Start \"I am committed to giving Alberta's children a healthy start and a promising future.\" Proper nutrition and exercise are the basic building blocks in any child's life - from conception right through their school years. Leading a happy life begins with a healthy mind and body. A child's rst six years are the most influential in their lives. Promise Two - Safety, Growth and Development \"I undertake the responsibility of working with my neighbours to provide safe and healthy communities for our children's growth, education and development.\" Every child's path crosses many others\u2014families, neighbours, friends, coaches and others in their communities who also want the best for them. We all have a responsibility for helping our children grow and enriching their experiences and opportunities along the way. 8 Promise Three - Interaction, Mentoring and Inspiration \"The power of one person is a remarkable gift. By investing in a child's life, I will lead by example and encourage others to do the same through my own actions.\" Relationships with others are the foundation of trust and growth. Positive relationships are based upon the willingness of adults to contribute time and effort to listen, show and teach.Promise Four - Participation and Volunteering \"I will set an example that the rewards of volunteering are immeasurable. Through my actions, our children will discover the joy and fulllment of participation in community and group projects\". Community service has deep roots in Alberta. It's volunteering to build a playground, to coach a team, or to give music lessons. It's sharing our strengths to help a child develop their own unique skills. It's opening a closed door, giving a hug and most importantly just being there. Promise Five - Leadership and Innovation \"I will strive to seek out the best tools, best models and best examples of other individuals and communities so that, through their positive innovations, Alberta's children may learn, benet and succeed.\" We must be involved in lifelong learning and continually pass on our knowledge and experience to those who can learn from us. The measure of our success may be how well we encourage our children to reach for the stars and seize the unlimited opportunities before them.When many of us look back on our own childhood, many can remember the special day we were given a little red wagon . Or, if we weren't lucky enough to have one of our own, we envied those that did. We pulled it everywhere. We often tried to put everything we owned into it\u2014sometimes too much. We were particularly happy when a parent or adult extended their hand to help us pull the load\u2014it was even better if we were the load. That is what Alberta's Promise is about. It is about adults extending a hand to encourage, support and help our children and youth. The Little Red Wagon symbolizes the commitments of Albertans who support making Alberta the best place in the world to raise our children and youth. The red wagon of Promise has made incredible tracks across Alberta this year. Make a promise, make it happen.TH E LI T T L E RE D Wagon 910 Alberta's Promise Partnerships are created by Promise Agencies, Promise Builders and Promise Communities who share our vision of \"...making Alberta the best place in the world to raise our children.\" Becoming a Promise Builder, a Promise Agency or a Promise Community within Alberta's Promise involves making a commitment to children and youth.Promise Agency Agencies provide services and resources to children and youth. Promise Agencies devote more than 50 per cent of their activities to beneting children and youth. Only non-government, charitable organizations are eligible for partnership with Alberta's Promise. Alberta's Promise distinguishes Promise Agencies into two categories. Service Agencies include agencies that deliver programs and projects directly to children and youth in Alberta communities. Community Funders are United Way types of organizations and Foundations. These organizations direct funds to the service providers and are indirectly involved in providing programs and projects for children and youth. Promise Builder A Promise Builder is a business, corporation, service club, media, industry, professional association or foundation that makes a commitment to donate additional resources to Alberta's children and youth expanding on previous charitable donations. A Promise Builder can contribute through cash, gifts-in-kind, employee volunteerism or undertaking programs and projects that benet Alberta's children and youth.AL B E R TA 'S PR O M I S E PartnershipsPromise Community A Promise Community is a city, town, county, settlement or other municipality that encourages partnerships between their local businesses, foundations, service clubs and agencies for the benet of children and youth. Promise Advocates and Associations are Community Collaborators and/or Child and Youth Advocates and will be considered under the Promise Community category if they include groups working to improve the quality, quantity and efciency of services available to children and youth.11 The world will be a better place because you were important in the life of a child.Premier Klein launched the Alberta's Promise movement on May 20, 2003 to encourage all Albertans to work together to create more opportunities for children and youth to be successful, healthy and happy. He founded the program with the belief that it takes an entire community working together if we are going to do the best job of raising our children. And the movement is working. Over the last two years the Little Red Wagon has come to be recognized by Albertans everywhere as a promise to care for children and youth. We are delighted to report that the Alberta's Promise movement has grown beyond expectations again this year. The bene ts and opportunities for children and youth are revealed within the partner stories that are told in this second Annual Partners' Report. During the rst year of the movement, 118 partnerships were formed. This year 128 new partners came on board, bringing the total partners to 246. Alberta's Promise also grew geographically and there are now Little Red Wagon partners in each of the ten children's services regions of the province. Our business plan called for an increase of three new media partners this year. By the end of the year we were delighted to have welcomed nine new partners to the movement, exceeding the target by six. The Edmonton Journal and Calgary Herald both published major special feature inserts. Business in Calgary did an excellent job of pulling the wagon by featuring Premier Klein, Colleen Klein and the Little Red Wagon on the cover of their March magazine. And Shaw TV Calgary created the holiday season 'Wagon of Wishes' campaign with the Davar Child Care Society. The committed work of these partners to get the Little Red Wagon in front of so many Albertans certainly made a positive difference in spreading the Alberta's Promise message. CORUS Radio joined the movement and immediately started airing Promise partner commitments on their airwaves. Partnership stories air on four stations in Edmonton (880 Cool, 92.5 Joe FM, CISN Country and 630 CHED) and three Calgary stations (Q107, CHQR 770 , Country 105) that remind listeners \"Alberta's Promise partners make a difference.\" CFCN Television (CTV Calgary) took the Alberta's Promise message to their viewers by declaring support for children and youth and by inviting others to join the movement. The CFCN 30-second public service announcement has aired hundreds of times over the last year and helped build brand awareness of the Little Red Wagon throughout Calgary. But recognizing partnerships in print, radio and television was only part of our mission to publicly celebrate and recognize our partners' commitments to children and youth. Hosting and assisting at over 20 partner events like the Calgary Children's Initiative Collaborative Breakfast, Agrium's Employee Recognition event and the Junior League's Junior Chef's program gave us the opportunity to bring additional public awareness to these great events A Promise is de ned as an assurance that one will do something or that something will happen.MessageFORMER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR 'S Keeping PromisesKeeping PromisesKeeping Promises 1213that support children and youth. Ongoing requests for Alberta's Promise involvement at partner events pushed us well past our goal of assisting at 13 partner events and we were excited to participate. Because we wanted to share the valuable stories and news coming out of these partner events, we increased our E-news from a quarterly to a monthly publication. We created a calendar for partner events on our website and also built an electronic calendar that we send out monthly to help publicize upcoming partner events. Our website has been an effective tool for online applications for prospective partners. When approved, we offer all our partners their own web page on our site and this also has been an effective tool for partner recognition and service and especially helpful for agencies working to get their messages to more Albertans. More and more of our partners recognize the value of using the Alberta's Promise logo on their website and now they often link to our site to encourage their visitors to discover Alberta's Promise. Our long-time partner, Canada Safeway has taken the lead on using the Little Red Wagon logo and placed decals on the entry doors in each of the 80 Safeway stores in Alberta. Making children and youth a priority is exactly what Safeway has promised and then con rmed it publicly for all to see by proudly displaying the Little Red Wagon of Alberta's Promise. This initiative by Canada Safeway will result in one million brand exposures in less than one year. Other Promise partners also con rm their commitments to children and use our logo on their letterhead, newsletters and brochures. Partner wagons are on display everywhere in this province from reception areas to front desks to specially created display cases. Wow - so many Albertans pulling together to build an even better province for our kids! As Alberta's Promise moves into year three, more good news will surely follow. Our Minister, the Honourable Heather Forsyth has challenged us to signi cantly increase the awareness of Alberta's Promise during this centennial year. A new Alberta's Promise video will be created and an Alberta's Promise Centennial Celebration is scheduled for later this year. On behalf of Alberta's Promise administrative team I extend a sincere thank you to all Albertans already working together for our children and youth. You made a promise and you made it happen. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the Alberta's Promise team Diana Davidson, Anna Flasch, Rose Heinz, Jennifer Link, Debra Metcalfe and Kevin Weidlich for their dedication and hard work. With a small of ce every team member is involved in every major undertaking. It has been a pleasure and joy to work with this talented and dedicated team. Ron Bell Former Executive Director, Alberta's Promise 14A Promise is de ned as an assurance that one will do something or that something will happen.MessageEXECUTIVE DIRECTOR 'S Keeping PromisesKeeping PromisesKeeping Promises I am honoured to join the team at Alberta's Promise and assume the challenging position as the new Executive Director for the program. In just two short years, Alberta's Promise has evolved into a movement of caring for kids that now reaches into all areas of our province. This year's business plan has expanded to include more partners, more recognition events and more media coverage for all partners. This can only mean even more great promises will be made to care for our youngest citizens. As Premier Klein expressed, 'The next Alberta is for our children and youth and about our children and youth.\" I can only add that kids are everybody's business and every Albertan has something to offer the next generation. I am truly inspired by the vision and the compassion of Alberta's Promise partners as shown in the stories of this Partners' Report. I look forward to being a part of a team of individuals from all sectors of society who, collaboratively, are committed to pulling together for our children and youth. Tyra Henschel Executive Director, Alberta's PromiseMaking a promise and then making it happen is exactly what our partners have accomplished and the impact and end results have made life better for our children and youth. 15 I am thoroughly enjoying the opportunity to work on behalf of the children and youth of Alberta as Minister of Children's Services. One of the real thrills of my job is witnessing the exceptional impact made by the Alberta's Promise partners. In their own way, each is creating a brighter future for Alberta. Alberta's Promise is an excellent example of how government and the community can work together. In this case the government provides the administrative funds, while the corporations, foundations, agencies, and municipalities deliver the program. By putting Promise Builders together with Promise Agencies, who deliver programs, some amazing things have happened. My vision is that Alberta's Promise will have a continually growing impact with more and more Albertans grasping the vision and dedicating their nancial and volunteer efforts to initiatives that benet children and youth. At the same time, I want all Albertans to recognize the unselsh contribution that the partners are making. On a personal note, I want you to know that I have always been an advocate for bettering the lives and opportunities for our young people. I am committed to Alberta's Promise and will do my utmost to see that it continues to grow and flourish. Dear Alberta's Promise Partners, My greatest love is for Alberta's children. I am so pleased that each of you have so willingly embraced the Alberta's Promise concept. Every one of you is making a difference. We have all heard the phrase, \"It takes a whole community to raise a child.\" Nothing could be closer to the truth than the outcomes we see through the efforts of the Alberta's Promise partners. By unselshly giving of your time and nancial resources, children in every part of Alberta are living better lives. As you review the stories in this partners' report, I am condent you will be amazed by the diversity of ideas, activities and successes you have created. Even the smallest gestures are important. You have not only responded to children and youth who need critical help, but also to those who just need a little support and encouragement so they may become all they can be. All of these kids need us. By helping them now we know they will not only have better lives today but for their entire lifetime. Together, we are making Alberta the best place in the world for children and youth. Thank you for pulling the Little Red Wagon . On behalf of the people and Government of Alberta, I am pleased to extend congratulations and thanks to all Alberta's Promise partners. This centennial year is for celebration of both our past and our future. When we look back, we see how our forefathers contributed to the well-being of our province. Their commitment to improving Alberta's quality of life was no different than what is being committed by today's Alberta's Promise partners. All are dedicated to making our province a better place for our children and youth to live, grow and thrive. During the past year, I have welcomed 128 new Alberta's Promise partners. I am inspired by how all partners have kept their promises, and I believe the best is yet to come. We now have 246 Alberta's Promise partners and expect many more to join. Imagine the impact that a thousand committed partners could have upon the well-being of our children and youth. Our most precious resource is our time and volunteering. It is the greatest gift we can give to others. In particular, I express thanks to the members of the Premier's Council for volunteering to guide Alberta's Promise through another year. Continued best wishes to all Alberta's Promise partners for their efforts in making a difference in the lives of our children and youth. Colleen Klein Honourary Chairperson, Alberta's PromiseRalph Klein PremierHeather Forsyth Minister, Alberta Children's Services 1617 It has been an exceptional year. We have more than doubled the number of Alberta's Promise partners and more and more are signing on every day. They are not just joining\u2014they are making signicant commitments to work for the benet of children and youth. The Alberta's Promise staff, led by Ron Bell, our former Executive Director and currently by Tyra Henschel, our new Executive Director, continues to do a stellar job of introducing new people to Alberta's Promise, and more importantly, works with the partners to help them meet their commitments. A special thanks is owed to the media partners who have so generously assisted us in recognizing the contributions our partners have made. More and more I see the Little Red Wagon in corporate boardrooms and reception areas. I personally would like to see a wagon in every ofce in Alberta. There are over 100,000 businesses in Alberta with every one of them a potential partner. With Alberta's Promise it is easy to succeed\u2014all we have to do is put our children rst. That is what it is all about. Let's ll the wagon with kids and keep it moving ahead! This is my second message to readers of the Alberta's Promise Partners' Report. The past year has been exceptional. Each Red Wagon presentation, where we welcomed new partners, has become larger and larger. Most importantly, the new partners represent every positive aspect of our communities. There are large and small companies who donate both nancial and volunteer resources. There are agencies of varied description\u2014some that assist newborns and others that work with young adults. I express special thanks to the partners who have remained with us from the beginning for both maintaining and renewing their commitments and for introducing others to the Alberta's Promise movement. This collective effort is generating huge rewards for our communities. As Co-Chair of Alberta's Promise, I have been blessed to work with enthusiastic members of the Premier's Council. I thank them for their encouragement and vision. They truly represent the spirit of what denes Albertans and makes us great. I am condent that, through their example, thousands more Albertans will understand and share in our vision and the excitement of what it means to pull together for the kids of Alberta - pulling the Little Red Wagon .

The committee's mission is to enhance community capacity to foster a seamless continuum of services that prevents family, sexual and other interpersonal violence. The Action Committee Against Violence has developed the capacity to identify emerging needs in the community, and has led a coordinated response to those needs through its Youth Violence Prevention program, Turn Off the Violence campaign and Peace Heroes program. In the coming year, the Action Committee Against Violence, in partnership with Calgary Family Services and the Calgary Children's Initiative, plans to develop a comprehensive community-based response to bullying. The project will improve coordination and collaboration between agencies and reduce gaps in services and duplication in programs. \"Violence has a profound negative impact on the lives of Alberta's children. We must all work together to ensure all children can participate in the Alberta Advantage,\" said Karen Wolroth, Coordinator.ABC Head Start ABC Head Start originated in 1985 when public health nurses identied that a signicant number of Alberta children's social and academic development was delayed as a result of having limited nancial and other resources. The project aimed to remedy gaps in the children's learning experiences as well as provide support to improve parents' parenting skills. ABC Head Start now helps 288 children and families with early childhood education and family support services in 11 communities across Edmonton. The agency employs more than 80 staff, offers excellent program services and stands on a strong agency infrastructure. Volunteers, partnering community agencies, as well as individual and corporate supporters also contribute to the children's well being. In the coming year, ABC Head Start commits to increasing the number of people volunteering their time in the program by 10 per cent over the next three years. They commit to increasing the hours of volunteer service by 10 per cent over the next ve years, and increasing the number of children and families that use its services by 10 per cent over the next ve years. \"We believe that Alberta's Promise will help us achieve these goals and our mission; working with low-income families and their preschool children to achieve success in learning and life,\" said Kathy Lenihan, Acting Director. Airdrie Boys and Girls Club For over 24 years, the Airdrie Boys and Girls Club has offered high quality, low-cost social, recreational and educational programs to the children, youth and families of Airdrie and surrounding communities. Everyone is welcome to participate, regardless of social, nancial or family situations. The Airdrie Boys and Girls Club continues to work on its goal of fundraising to build an expanded, permanent facility. Along with this project, many other programs and services are continually being improved and expanded. The agency also undertook the development of a Community Haunted House in 2004. Over 500 community youth and residents took in this four-day event. Sponsorship from local businesses and service clubs made this possible. \"We believe 'Every Kid Has Potential',\" said Karen Bannick, Executive Director. Airdrie Boys and Girls Club offers kids plenty of fun times.Airdrie Festival of Lights The Airdrie Festival of Lights is a magnicent light display covering nearly four acres of land in the centre of Airdrie. Visitors from all over Alberta come to enjoy the animates and theme displays, ride Santa's Express and Iron Horse Park's Christmas Train, shop in Santa's Workshop, enjoy tasty treats from the concession and be entertained by local and area performers on the Safeway Stage. Community and charitable groups are invited to raise funds for their organizations by participating in the Festival's Group Volunteer Program. \"During the month of December, over 5000 volunteer hours are required to run the Festival. Many of the volunteers are youth. It is our goal to strengthen, by involving the youth from our community,\" said Peter Pape, President. In the 2004 season, we created \"Santa's Kids,\" as part of the Santa's Kids initiative, children and their families from the Children's Wish Foundation and Kids Cancer Care were bused from Calgary to Airdrie for a free evening at the Festival. \"In creating the Santa's Kids, the organizing committee was hoping to bring a little light to sick children and their loved ones, to take them away from their worries, if only for an evening. Given the overwhelming support and positive responses, Santa's Kids will continue in the years to come,\" said Greg Dyki, Festival Director.Alberta Ballet Alberta Ballet, based in Calgary and Edmonton, is one of Canada's nest creative ballet companies and training institutions. Alberta Ballet recognizes the critical role it plays in providing a performing arts education to Alberta's youth. Its Discover Dance Student Matinee Series offers a unique way for students and teachers to enjoy live dance performance. Students from Edmonton and Calgary can attend a matinee performance arranged exclusively for students rather than public audiences. The matinees reach 5,000 students in a typical season in both cities, and in the coming year, Alberta Ballet will continue to work closely with Calgary's Arts Education Action Committee, Calgary's Arts partners in Education Society and the Edmonton and Calgary Boards of Education toward a common education goal. Alberta Ballet Northern Tights Tour is another component of the educational outreach Discover Dance Program. Through this program, the Company performs for youth in northern Alberta communities and each year over 2,000 students who would not otherwise have the opportunity to experience live ballet are exposed to, and enriched by, this artform. \"The love of dance is limited neither to age nor experience. Alberta Ballet is proud to foster this spirit by presenting Discover Dance Student Matinees to thousands of Alberta school children every year,\" said Jean Grand-Maitre, Artistic Director.Airdrie Family Services Society Airdrie Family Services is a charitable organization that has been providing family support programs and services to Airdrie and surrounding area for 23 years. These support services include counselling for children, youth, families and individuals for relationship issues, a Family Resource Program and access to quality childcare. All services are designed to prevent personal and family breakdown, to enhance the abilities of individuals and families to constructively manage their lives and to enrich the quality of family life. Airdrie Family Services has been named one of 20 ParentLink Centres across Alberta. The intent of these centres is to reduce the barriers for families to accessing programs and services. This has enabled Airdrie Family Services to extend its hours of operation and expanded services providing more opportunities to increase the commitment to children. In addition to regular programs offered, the agency has introduced two new programs this year: \"Share it Forward\" and \"Daddy 'N Me.\" Share it Forward is designed to give parents and care-givers developmental information and play- based activities for children up to the age of ve. Daddy'N Me is an opportunity for fathers and children to meet on a Saturday morning, make new friends, and learn some of the \"nuts and bolts\" of being a Dad. \"I am pleased to embrace the responsibility and opportunity to participate in building needed, sustainable programs that will offer support and lifelong strategies for maintaining healthy relationships within families and within their communities,\" said Donna White, Board Member for Airdrie Family Services. 22 Alberta Ballet Discover Dance Event23Alberta Conflict Transformation Society Alberta Conflict Transformation Society provides the service of community conferencing. Conferencing is a process which teaches people who cause harm to others how to be responsible and accountable directly to those who have been harmed by their actions or behaviours. This process allows all parties the opportunity to address their emotional concerns as victims, offenders and their supporters which are not presently addressed by the justice, health, social welfare or educational systems. This model provides an opportunity to address the harm, and its rippling effect, caused by crime and conflict. Currently, the society is working within the Edmonton Public School Board with students as an alternative to suspension and expulsion. In the coming year the society commits to doubling the number of les it accepts within the Edmonton Public School District to 24, the number of les it works with from Alberta Justice. These translate into an increase in funding of $20,000 and a commitment of 40 volunteer days. \"We are optimistic that as resources can be increased, workload and the number of les dealt with will proportionately increase,\" said Aaron Nichols, Chairperson. Alberta Council of Women's Shelters Formed in 1981, the Alberta Council of Women's Shelters provides a unied voice for women's shelters and the women and children they serve. Alberta Women's Shelters served over 5,000 women and 5,000 children in the last year. The council works to facilitate networking and information sharing, acquire adequate resources for member shelters, influence public policy and systems, increase public awareness of issues related to family violence, and foster professional development within Alberta's sheltering movement. In the coming year, The Alberta Council of Women's Shelters will provide additional educational opportunities through its Children Exposed to Family Violence seminars. \"Kids who feel safe and heard can make dramatic progress, learning the skills they need to choose a different way,\" said Jan Reimer, Provincial Co-ordinator. Alberta Mentor Foundation for Youth The Alberta Mentor Foundation for Youth (AMFY) is dedicated to helping junior and senior high school students achieve their full potential through supportive in-school mentoring relationships. The organization continues to grow and is committed to supporting 300 mentor and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 matches by 2006. In 2004, volunteers donated over 11,000 hours of their time assisting AMFY in fullling its mission. Due to great demand for the program, AMFY is implementing a community-based volunteer recruitment strategy in East Calgary and Airdrie. \"Mentoring makes me feel good about myself. My prot\u00e9g\u00e9 is a great inspiration for me to put aside my 'stuff' and be there for her,\" said one volunteer mentor. Young children offer their hands at ACWS event.

Alberta Ballet Discover Dance EventBig Brothers and Big Sisters of Calgary & Area The mission of Big Brothers and Big Sisters of Calgary & Area is to enrich the lives of children through mentoring. The agency has pledged to increase the number of children matched in a mentoring program from 325 in 2003 to over 600 in 2006, representing a $200,000 investment over a ve-year period. Plans include continuing this increase beyond 2010. In all of 2004, a total of 750 children were served. In the rst two months of 2005, 534 children had already been served. \"I have been very fortunate with the life I have lived. I truly believe becoming an In-School Mentor was one of the best decisions in my life. I know personally I have grown and have gotten back 10 times what I have given to being an In-School Mentor. I get to see the world through a child's eyes. The experience has changed the course of my life,\" said Todd Berry, In-School Mentor and Past President, Canadian Progress Club, Bow River.Between Friends Club for Youth With Disabilities Since 1982 the Between Friends Club has provided year- round recreational and social programs for Calgary's youth with disabilities. The organization believes that every one deserves the chance to meet friends and have fun in an accepting and safe environment, so they provide opportunities for all youth, no matter what their disability. Programming includes Teen Night Out, swimming, drama, music, art, bowling and more. Most parents notice their children's increased self-esteem and improved social skills shortly after participating. In the summer, the agency's focus turns to Camp Bonaventure, its summer day camp that runs four, concurrent two-week sessions during July and August. Camp is offered to those children and young people with any type of disability. Currently, membership consists of 645 young people who are living with 82 different disabilities. Between Friends Club is committed to increasing membership and supporting more young people who have disabilities to enhance their quality of life. \"Alberta Computer Cable Inc. has supported Between Friends Club for over 10 years. We prefer to support participatory activities that staff can be involved in and provide time at work for these activities,\" said Louise Nesterenko, Vice-President.Big Brothers Big Sisters of Canada Big Brothers Big Sisters of Canada (BBBSC) is the leading child and youth serving organization providing mentoring programs across the country. Providing support to more than 300 Canadian communities, over 170 local agencies offer the service that the organization was founded on, one- to-one matching. Men and women give of their time to become a mentor to a youngster who can greatly benet from having an adult role model to look up to. Times change. Volunteers change. Big Brothers Big Sisters of Canada has also changed. In response to the different needs and demands of children, youth and volunteers alike, they have created new programs to t our changing society. Couples for Kids, Cross Gender Matching, Internet Mentoring, In- School Mentoring, BIG/bunch and Kids 'n Kops group programs (for those kids on the waiting lists), and the new Life Skills Program all provide a variety of opportunities for volunteering and support to children and youth.

But home as he knows it doesn't full this boy's needs. So where does he go? Who does he turn to? Let your memories drift back in time to the tenuous days of your teenage years. Those times were critical in so many aspects. How fortunate that most people have families that support, nurture and love them through this incredible stage in life. Not all kids have that. Boys and Girls Club Community Services Avenue 15 can't replace a loving parent. However, it sure does do a great job of helping Calgary's homeless teens. Since 1987, Avenue 15 has done whatever they could to help boys like this. The truth is they have provided a safe, supportive environment for over 8,000 homeless and runaway youth in Calgary alone. Each year, the shelter provides as many as 4,000 safe nights and 12,000 meals to youth in need. Avenue 15 is an active response to the problem of homeless teens, assisting youth ages 12 to 17. Boys and Girls Club Community Services established the program to provide teens with an immediate, accessible, short-term alternative to life on the street. By offering them a place to stay, the shelter demonstrates that someone cares enough to help reduce the risks that affect their healthy development and take them off dangerous streets and out of unsafe family environments. No other facility of its kind is available in Calgary. The shelter is open seven days a week, 24 hours a day, and houses up to 15 youth each evening. It is very closely partnered with the Calgary Police Service, Calgary Rockyview Child and Family Services as well as intervention focused agencies. These kids get all the help the community has to offer. For example, In 2004, Avenue 15 assisted 640 youth in crisis by providing them with a safe place to sleep, and support in resolving their issues. In addition to providing food and shelter, Avenue 15 offers teens emotional, educational and employment support, referral to medical or dental care as needed and family mediation. \"Families are an essential part of our program and we work hard to reunite youth with their families through crisis intervention and family wellness,\" said Cheryl Doherty, Executive Director, Boys and Girls Club Community Services. Over half of Avenue 15's funding is generated through private and corporate donations. Funds raised for the program support the operational costs of the shelter, from heating and laundry to meals and counselling staff support to ensure that all youth in need have a safe place to stay. \"Avenue 15 is a critical community-based runaway and homeless shelter for youth that provides 24-hour-a-day, 365 days per year support to over 600 of Calgary's young people. With the help of companies such as Netlan Consulting and TransCanada Corporation along with other Promise Builders, Boys and Girls Clubs of Calgary provides an essential alternative to life on the street.\" \"Alberta's Promise has been a valuable partner to Boys and Girls Clubs and I would encourage community-minded corporations to consider their participation and investment in what is fundamental to the growth and development of the Province, our young people,\" said Cheryl Doherty, Executive Director, Boys and Girls Club Community Services. 28Boys and Girls Club Community Services The Boys and Girls Club Community Services (BGCCS) is committed to providing safe and positive environments for children and youth to gain life skills and develop meaningful relationships that will help them reach their full potential.

In turn, they partner with 120 child-serving, charitable organizations whose clients become the ticket recipients. Kids are attending major sporting events, concerts, theatre and participate in trips out of town, summer camps and horse-back riding. There are many barriers that keep children from reaching their full potential, and Kids Up Front is helping to open doors to their potential. The tickets translate into hope and possibilities, help to build self-condence and a feeling of \"tting in\" to society. \"With the help of our caring community, Kids Up Front will continue to increase the number of opportunities for kids and families in Alberta,\" said Barb Radu, National and Calgary Executive Director.Kids Up Front Foundation (Edmonton) Kids Up Front Edmonton is a charitable organization that provides entertainment and educational opportunities to children in need. It partners with corporations, entertainment venues and the public to \"recycle\" tickets that would otherwise go to waste. These tickets are given to 75 child-serving agencies, and they in turn distribute them to children and families in need. These opportunities allow these families to have fun and spend quality time together so they can heal, bond and unite. In 2003, Kids Up Front provided 4,750 opportunities valued at $73,681. This year, the agency provided 5,527 opportunities valued at $129,129. All indications for 2005 are that these numbers will be exceeded with over 5,000 opportunities provided in the rst quarter alone. In 2004, the organization teamed up with the RBC Foundation, the Citadel Theatre and the Eldon and Anne Foote Fund to launch a two-year pilot Kids Up Front at the Citadel. During the course of the pilot, Kids Up Front will distribute 500 tickets for the world premiere of A Giraffe in Paris by Mark Haroun. Also in 2004, HSBC Bank of Canada donated 500 tickets to Kids Up Front for Mystery of the Nile, showing at the Odyssium's IMAX Theatre. \"For many, evenings out are rare opportunities to spend quality time with family, have fun and just enjoy being a kid. Although these tickets have a donated value of nearly $350,000, the impact these outings have had on the families is priceless. We are making a difference in someone's life - one ticket at a time,\" said Harold Cornish, Executive Director.Kids with Cancer Society of Northern Alberta The Kids with Cancer Society, established in 1979, is a registered charitable organization providing programs and services for children and their families residing in the Northern Alberta/ Northwest Territories region.

Our signature sponsor, Canada Safeway Foundation, has signed on for the next three years, which is fabulous because it allows us to expand. We have a waiting list of schools and the demand continues to grow. Being a part of Alberta's Promise has been phenomenal, \"says Joanne tar Harmsesl, Project Coordinator, Junior Chefs program. Junior League of Calgary \u00aeThe truth is, there are startling national and local statistics on both child hunger and obesity. That's why the Junior League of Calgary developed the Junior Chefs program to help children ages 9 to 12 years of age to become aware of the long- term nutritional knowledge they need to make healthy food choices. One thing's for sure, when these children learn how to cook for themselves and what foods are better for their well-being, they will automatically take more responsibilities in choosing quality lifestyles. More responsibility translates into solid and condent youth. Here's how the program works. For 90 minutes a week, for eight weeks, students enrolled in Junior Chefs prepare simple, nutritional snacks and small meals. The program teaches food preparation, kitchen safety, table setting, table manners, and the importance of clean up. In short, promoting positive socialization, life skills, school attendance and family time enhances the lives of these children. Of course, this revolutionary program wouldn't be possible without the support of Alberta's Promise partners like Canada Safeway Foundation - who not only fund the program, but donate kitchen equipment and supplies as well. The Junior League of Calgary also provides funding, along with ofce space for the project coordinator, ofce supplies, photocopier, separate telephone and Internet lines, storage space for teaching and equipment supplies and facilities for volunteer training. The program currently draws on over 80 Junior League of Calgary volunteers. Piloted in three Calgary Board of Education (CBE) elementary schools, it is estimated that Junior Chefs has positively impacted over 500 of Calgary's children and their families. The program has been so well received by teachers, principals and parents it has grown to encompass 16 locations across four separate organizations - and promises to grow even further. All of these organizations have requested that Junior Chefs return for the 2004-05 school year, with many other schools and organizations requesting the program. As well, Junior Chefs is already planning to run summer camps at the Junior League of Calgary's facilities during the summer of 2005-06. \"Caring about our children and the communities in which they live has been a Safeway tradition for more than 75 years. The introduction of the Canada Safeway Foundation in 2002 rmly establishes our commitment to helping less fortunate children and their families realize their dreams and their potential. Together with the help of customers, friends and employees the Canada Safeway Foundation has provided over $1.6 million to organizations including: Boys & Girls Club, Junior League - Junior Chef program and Meals on Wheels. These programs teach young people nutrition and help them to develop skills, relationships, values and positive self-esteem. We believe that by working together we are making a positive change in so many children's lives,\" said Sue Bonville, Manager, Canada Safeway Foundation.\"These programs teach young people nutrition...\" Sue Bonville CANADA SAFEWAY FOUNDATION WORKING WITH THE JUNIOR LEAGUE OF CALGARY 5758KidSport Society of Alberta KidSport Alberta strives to help disadvantaged children participate and gain valuable benets from playing organized sport.

LDAA initiated a writing contest for Learning Disabilities Month for children and youth with learning disabilities as a means to focus on their talents, and build condence and self-esteem. \"For success, individuals with a learning disability require early identication and timely specialized assessments and intervention. Involving home, school, community and workplace settings becomes critical to helping these children. With support, these individuals can develop ways around their invisible disabilities to be contributing members of society,\" said Harvey Finnestad, Executive Director. 59Learning Disabilities Association of Alberta - Calgary Chapter In 2004, the Learning Disabilities Association of Alberta - Calgary Chapter (LDAA-CC) continued fostering its commitment to children and youth.

Vocational Design is a pilot program that is currently being developed and tested in three Calgary high schools. This is a transition support program for young adults with learning disabilities. \"I have to admit that before I started working here and getting to know these children, that I, too, was misinformed and very judgmental about learning disabilities. But, after seeing the energy, dedication and spirit that these kids have for life, it has really made me realize how special they truly are,\" said James Woodall, Counsellor.Literacy for Life Foundation Literacy for Life Foundation provides early intervention programs to children and youth in the Municipal District of Foothills #31.

Prairieaction Foundation The Prairie action Foundation exists to fund community- based action research into the disturbing and costly issues of violence and abuse. This research is vital to keep children safe in order for them to reach their highest potential. The Prairie action Foundation believes the best research occurs when academics collaborate with those workers who see the effects of this violence daily. Research must be relevant, it must be community-based and it must produce useful results. Building on Prairie action 's regular nancial support for RESOLVE - which conducts studies into issues of child abuse, bullying, aboriginal youth, youth involved in prostitution and family violence - the foundation launched its National Community Grants Program in 2004. RESOLVE Alberta evaluated the effectiveness of a pilot Community Safe Visitation program at the YWCA Sheriff King Home in Calgary. \"We now know that family violence, in all its forms, is the single biggest impediment to human development. That's why it can no longer be considered an issue affecting only women and children, or any one individual who is abused,\" said Margaret Newall, Chair.

The society does not receive any government funding and relies solely on private and corporate donations. Proceeds offered 'in memoriam' or raised through a variety of fundraising activities also support this valuable concept. The Rainbow Society's goals for the coming year are to continue to work to increase awareness and dollars raised, and to grow the endowment fund to where it can grant a wish to every child diagnosed in Alberta. \"There are no insurmountable obstacles... only dreams and wishes left unful lled.

It begins at birth with a parent as the child's rst teacher. Sharing quality time reading with a child encourages one-to-one bonding. \"Family Literacy\" is the way family members use reading, writing and language at home and in the community to build skills and relationships. The world of books opens doors to a child's future. Families that read together succeed together. Success by 6\u00ae truly believes this and is doing its part to help children reach levels they may not have a chance to reach otherwise. For example, in the last year, the Alberta Prairie COW has worked with over 6,700 rural Alberta children and their parents visiting over 160 Alberta communities with \"Home-Grown Literacy\" events. The program has partnered with 245 community Alberta agencies in creating exciting visits and learning opportunities.

ACRA was formed as a result of a number of municipalities who came together with common concerns and an interest to cooperate on regional issues. The members of the Alliance encourage communities to adopt the Five Promises and form partnerships that further the well-being of children in all communities. \"The Alberta Capital Region Alliance, a community of communities, believes that it takes an entire community to raise a child. Many of our citizens have said that the Capital Region is a great place to raise children. We agree, but there is more to be done. Working together, we can make this the best place in the world to raise our children,\" said Phyllis Kobasiuk, Chair. 134 A Promise is de ned as an assurance that one will do something or that something will happen.FeaturePROMISE PARTNER Keeping Promises Keeping Promises Keeping Promises Youth Helping Youth. \"Our community members are equally dedicated and through Alberta's Promise we will have the opportunity to celebrate with our community well into the future,\" said Strathcona County Mayor, Cathy Oleson. Ever feel like you want to be more involved, make a difference, have a voice in your community. Not sure what impact you have? It doesn't matter what age you are, it's natural to feel uncomfortable. The truth is, for Alberta's youth, everyday life holds its share of issues, complications and discomforts. That's why in Strathcona County, the youth of the community are taking a new approach to dealing with situations that arise. Instead of looking to adults for solutions to youth problems, they've formed a unique and effective youth council. Supported by Strathcona County Family Services, the Strathcona County Youth Council is made up of 20 to 25 volunteer teen members representing the junior and senior high schools in Strathcona County. The objectives of the group are very clear. They are assembled to promote and stimulate public awareness of their needs, concerns and strengths. The group meets every second Monday night during the school year and is committed to making sure everyone understands just what a positive role they can play in their community. But it's more than just talk. Once the council has completed discussion on an issue they develop an action plan. It may mean making recommendations to community agencies, community at large or County Council. They'll even go so far as to plan and implement events, programs and projects that will make life better for youth in the future. Some members of the council noticed that youth issues in the community needed a unique, inclusive youth approach. The group developed a special program that they took to the schools in the district and performed to illustrate their point. Some such programs have included: \"Youth Teaching Youth,\" a seminar called \"OPTIONS\" dealing with choices and decision- making, and \"Stand Up, or Stand By,\" dealing with confrontation and how to deal with bullying behaviours. But the council is about more than youth helping youth, it also supports community and social needs in the community such as the Christmas Bureau and Safe Place Fun Run. Youth Council members join to be involved with their community, develop leadership skills, help other youth and make friends and have fun - while making a difference. \"While the youth council has been in operation for 15 years, what Alberta's Promise has done is help raise awareness within the community about the council and youth issues. Now organizations in the community, when they're faced with youth issues, contact the Strathcona County Youth Council directly for advice and help. Whenever the council delivers a program to a junior high or high school audience, they're delivering information to their peers, their friends - so naturally, they're well received,\" said Corey Stevenson, Development Assets/Prevention Initiatives Worker. \"Strathcona County is committed to the well- being of our children and families within our community.

As such, it is Edmonton's goal to create a community that will advocate on behalf of Edmonton's children to ensure they have the necessary tools and resources to become the community leaders of tomorrow. Almost everything the City does has an impact on the daily lives of more than 160,000 children who call Edmonton home. This was recognized recently when City Council directed the Administration to develop a Children's Services Strategy that will integrate services for children across all agencies and City departments. This strategy, while still in the formative stages, will provide an exciting opportunity for staff from across the corporation to work together to create a child-friendly Edmonton. The City continues to provide administrative and nancial support to their many external partners and to work collaboratively with groups such as: Success by 6\u00ae, the Edmonton Federation of Community Leagues, the Edmonton Sports Council and Edmonton Arts Council. Families First, a major initiative undertaken by the City of Edmonton, the Government of Alberta, Capital Health, and the Community University Partnership, among others, will improve services for children in low- income families. Internally, a strategy to increase access to recreation and related services is being developed and will result in more children participating in healthy activities. As the city begins its second century, the commitment has been made to Edmonton's children to continue to build on a social foundation of services and programs that are already in place. \"By working together we can make our city a better place for children to live, learn and grow. The City of Edmonton will continue to work with our community partners to ensure our children are given every opportunity to succeed in life. By creating a positive, lasting influence, we can help our kids to become productive and caring citizens. They are, after all, our future leaders. It is essential that they have the tools and resources they need today so that Edmonton will remain a strong, competitive and vibrant city in the future,\" said Mayor Stephen Mandel. 136Buffalo Lake Metis Settlement Buffalo Lake Metis Settlement's vision is to build a healthy, happy, viable community that preserves this Alberta community's Metis culture and way of life.

The community is currently working on opening a new ParentLink Centre in the Family Centre, which will be an essential one-stop-shop for all family and child-centred services. In the coming year, the Settlement is committed to renovating its Recreation Centre to add a drop-in centre, and is adding new sports equipment and a tness centre to promote healthy living. \"Buffalo Lake Metis Settlement's mission is to have an effective and accountable government that responds to existing and emerging issues.

Fort Saskatchewan's nearly 50 community groups and organizations work together to deliver a wide range of programs and services for children and youth. In the coming year, the City is seeking potential sponsors to donate signage promoting the City of Fort Saskatchewan as an Alberta's Promise Community. \"We are extremely proud of the fact that the City of Fort Saskatchewan has been recognized as an \"Alberta's Promise\" community.

Once we met with organizations, we found that Alberta's Promise t right into what they are all about,\" said John deBruijn, Director of Community Services, City of Fort Saskatchewan. If ever a community demonstrated care and devotion to its citizens, the City of Fort Saskatchewan undoubtedly shines. In 2004, the City of Fort Saskatchewan was designated as a Promise Community with the goal to encourage 15 local groups and organizations to become Promise Builders within the next year. They've fullled this target and more. Since that time, the City has had a number of successes in the area of \"partnership with children and youth.\" The fact is, a number of Alberta's Promise Agencies and Promise Builders have been present and active in the community - from youth-focused programs that deal with drugs and alcohol, to family focused programs such as those presented by the Fort Saskatchewan Families First Society and Fort Saskatchewan Rhymes and Storytimes. The City's commitment to youth makes it easy and appealing for numerous small charitable organizations to work with them. Families First is one such organization satisfying certain community needs by offering services to parents of young families the opportunity to improve parenting skills and build their condence. A volunteer board of dedicated parents who believe that children deserve a healthy start in a safe, strong community leads the organization. Families First even goes so far as to provide quality childcare to parents and caregivers who attend programs at no charge and free transportation for those without vehicles. Then there's the registered Parent-Child Mother Goose Program. Its contributions are valued and necessary in the City. Rhymes and Storytimes is also a free-of-charge, group experience for parents, caregivers and their babies and young children, focusing on the pleasure and power of using oral rhymes, songs and stories together. Through the program the parent-child bond is strengthened along with family literacy. Parents are also given the opportunity to link with other resources in the community and build a support group where they can feel comfortable. \"We actively sought out groups that would help us support this program - it really wasn't a hard sell. Once we met with organizations, we found that Alberta's Promise t right into what they are all about,\" said John deBruijn, Director of Community Services, City of Fort Saskatchewan. \"On the day we received our wagon from Alberta's Promise - both Family First and Rhymes and Storytimes were thrilled to be included.

Community Outreach Services was designed by the Jasper Community Team, an intersectoral and collaborative network of human services providers and community residents. Community Outreach Services, which is sustained by pooling resources, offers an efcient vehicle for agencies and government to implement any social initiatives at a local level. The Jasper Community Team model demonstrates that, by acknowledging the interconnectedness of agency mandates, pooling resources, and truly collaborating to ll gaps in services, a small community like Jasper can have locally designed, accessible and meaningful services for individuals, children and families. \"The formal designation of Jasper as a Promise Community has multiple benets: it recognizes the efforts of the municipality on behalf of children, while at the same time provides additional opportunities to publicly acknowledge and applaud the contribution of those local business Promise Builders which are the foundation of strong and caring communities, and thereby encourages others to step forward,\" said Richard Ireland, Mayor. 140Elizabeth Metis Settlement Elizabeth Metis Settlement is a community committed to providing programs and opportunities for their young families, children and youth.

Strathcona County provides services to children through Recreation, Parks and Culture programs, Family and Community Services programs, Elk Island Public Schools, Elk Island Catholic Schools and a myriad of other valuable groups and associations. A 1997 federal government study determined that Strathcona County volunteers contributed 1.7 million hours of labour to this community annually. There has been a steady increase in volunteer commitment as the population and volunteer needs increase. Considering the enormous hours of volunteer effort that occurs in Strathcona, it would be difcult to calculate the time spent on commitments specic to children and youth. However, it can be assumed that the hours are indeed signicant. \"Children are life's miracles. The best thing we can do for a child is to provide appropriate resources so they have every opportunity for a positive, healthy life,\" said Mayor Cathy Olesen.
