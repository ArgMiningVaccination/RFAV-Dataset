Extraction of Bioactive Compounds The increasing demand for herbal nutraceuticals that offer a number of health advan- tages, necessitate the importance of efcient extraction methodologies for obtaining optimal amounts of high-quality bioactive compounds in a more efcient and time-efcient manner. Faster extraction methodologies are preferred as they reduce any potential degradation of the active compounds [36]. During traditional times, extracts were prepared by boiling either the specic plant parts, such as leaves, root, flower, or the whole plant in water [ 37]. This process was both time consuming and inefcient. It should be noted that selection of the appropriate extraction techniques is crucial as it greatly affects the nal product obtained [ 38]. Below, we list the various state-of-the-art extraction methodologies, which are both time-efcient and effective. 3.1. Soxhlet Extraction Soxhlet extraction, which is otherwise known as continuous hot extraction, is one of the simplest and most inexpensive extraction methodologies. The extraction is done using a Soxhlet apparatus made of glass. The apparatus has a round distillation flask at the bottom, an extraction tube, a siphon tube, and a condenser at the top. The sample is placed in a porous thimble, i.e., commonly made using a thick lter paper, and it is then loaded into the extraction chamber. The extraction solvent in the round bottom flask is evaporated upon direct heating of the distillation flask and condenses on passing through the condenser. The condensate reaches the extraction chamber from where the desired compounds can be extracted based on the polarity . When the chamber is about to be filled, it is then emptied by a siphon when it reaches a particular level and the solvent moves back into the distillation flask, carrying the analyte to the bulk liquid. The following cycle is repeated many times with the same batch of solvents being recirculated. Once the process is complete, the extracts are filtered and the solvent is removed with the help of a rotary evaporator. The major advantage of this technique is the limited consumption of the solvents as they are recirculated multiple times. However, it may be time-consuming, and since the extraction is done at the boiling point of the solvent, it may not be appropriate for extraction of thermo-labile bioactive compounds [38,39]. 3.2. Ultrasound-Assisted Extraction (UAE) UAE uses high frequency (20 kHz) pulses to generate acoustic waves, which create regions of compression and rarefaction while passing through the solvent and form cav- itation bubbles. The sample and its appropriate solvents can be taken in a volumetric flask and are then sonicated in a temperature controlled ultrasonic bath for a denite time. When the surface area of bubbles increases during the rarefaction process, there is increased gas diffusion and hence the bubbles expand. During compression, the sample undergoes rapid condensation and releases energy. These ejected shock waves enable improved massSeparations 2023 ,10, 177 12 of 28 transfer within the plant cell, thereby releasing the cell contents, which can then be ltered for the separation of the extract from the plant residues. As with every other technology involved in the extraction, this technique is also influenced by certain factors, such as power, intensity, frequency, temperature, period of operation, solvent characteristics, and the characteristics of source material [ 40]. Discoursed specics reveal that acoustic cavita- tion and sonoporation, which are pivotal in the extraction process, are aligned towards the uniformity of source samples. Uniformity of the cellular matrix leads to the uniformity in the pore formation due to cavitation and thereby helps in the effectual release of bioactive components from the matrix [41,42]. The advantages of this technique are its inexpensiveness, simple procedure, rapid nature, and lower solvent consumption, in addition to improved yield and quality of the extract, thus making it a better option for commercial uses [ 43]. It was reported that 20% higher yield of polyphenols was obtained from Salvia ofcinalis with much less sample consumption and 3-fold lower processing time using UAE. Nano emulsion of anise extracts formulated using the ultrasound assisted technique was found to be effective against most of the tested pathogens and exhibited a more notable antimicrobial activity than the bulk extract [ 43,44]. The disadvantage lies in the fact that both yield and kinetics of extraction largely depend on the nature of the plant matrix. Moreover, the active part of the ultrasound waves may be restricted to areas around the ultrasonic emitter only. In addition, optimization of the solvent composition, appropriate agitation, input power, and right time is the major factor that determines the efciency of the method [45,46]. 3.3. Microwave-Assisted Extraction (MAE) MAE is a widely used technique for rapid extraction of compounds from the sample using microwaves with frequencies of around 300 MHz to 300 GHz. Microwaves heat up the solvent mixture of the sample, causing disruption of the cell membranes and thus partitioning the analytes from the sample to the solvent. Liquid solvents, such as water or alcohol, which have the capability to absorb energy from microwaves and elicit differential afnities for the different compounds of interest are used in the process. During the process, heat generated is due to the alignment of the polar compounds in an electric eld; rotation of these molecules at a very high speed further leads to cell disruption. The extraction process begins with an increase in temperature and pressure resulting in the release of solute molecules from the active sites of the sample matrix into the solvent. This coactive amalgamation of heat and mass transfer phenomena, combined with volumetric heat dissipation, are the distinctive features of the technique that generates sufcient internal pressure to cause the rupture of cell walls [ 47,48]. For example, the MAE separation technique has conveniently and effectively been used to isolate the polyphenols including aloe-emodin, aloin A, aloin B, aloeresin D, aloesin, etc. from the aloe vera sample [ 49,50]. Authors involved in this study also noted the importance of the different parameters, such as extraction time, temperature, solvent volume on the extraction yield, and bioactive component quantity [51]. The major advantages of MAE are the requirements of lower extraction time and solvent consumption, simultaneous operation with multiple (up to 40) samples, reduced equipment size, reduced thermal gradients, and increased extract yield. The comparative effectiveness of MAE over Soxhlet extraction has been evidenced in a recent study focusing on oil yield [ 52]. Another advantage when compared with the conventional heating process is its energy efciency. The disadvantages are that it is not appropriate for extraction of non-polar compounds or temperature-sensitive compounds and is incompatible with highly viscous solvents [ 53,54]. The efciency of MAE depends upon several parameters including the properties of the solvents and compound (dielectric constants, polarity, solubility, partition coefcient, mass diffusivity, and volumes of the extracting solvent and sample), microwave power, frequency and duration of irradiation, extraction pressure, and the number of cycles [55,56].Separations 2023 ,10, 177 13 of 28 3.4. Supercritical Fluid Extraction (SFE) SFE enables the extraction of bioactive compounds in a non-degraded form and with very high specificity using supercritical fluids as solvents. Supercritical fluids have higher temperature and pressure than its critical points making the gaseous and liquid phases indistin- guishable. They have similar densities to ordinary fluids, similar to gases, and also enable easy penetration of gases. The density will be changed upon a small change in the temperature or pressure, which can thereby alter the solvation power, allowing convenient separation of extract and solvent. Supercritical CO 2is a widely used solvent in this process due to its moderate temperature (31.3\u000eC) and pressure (72.9 atm), low toxicity , non-inflammable nature, high purity , and because it can be separated by depressurization to yield an extract free of solvent, which can also be reused. As in other separation techniques, operating conditions influence the capacity and quality of the extraction process. Debbabi et al. have reported a change in extraction yield of bioactive components from Calamintha nepeta subsp. nepeta from 0.73 to wt% at 90 and 300 bar, respectively [ 57]. On the other hand, lower pressures of parsley fruit extracts comprised mainly of the phenylpropene, apiole, were reported to have stronger antibacterial effects [58]. Supercritical fluids allow faster mass transfer properties and can readily diffuse through the raw materials giving improved extraction efciency and yield of the bioactive compounds. SFE is ideal for thermally labile compound extraction. Moreover, SFE is environment friendly and less time consuming. The main disadvantages of SFE, however, are its expensiveness and the complex conguration of the system, which requires properly trained personnel to operate the process [ 39,45]. One of other major drawbacks of using supercritical CO 2is its lipophilicity and non-polar nature, which can be resolved by using modiers or co-solvents, such as methanol. Interestingly, SFE can be used in the extrac- tion of carotenoids from tomatoes and to separate lycopene from it by coupling it with supercritical fluid chromatography [59,60]. 3.5. Accelerated Solvent Extraction (ASE) ASE is the process which uses high temperatures of about 50-200\u000eC and pressures (10-15 MPa) to extract compounds from solid or semisolid matrix. The high temperature favors the increased extraction efciency of the analyte and the high pressure helps in preventing the solvent vaporization at temperatures above their boiling point and also increases their mass transfer rates, thereby enhancing the kinetics of reaction. The low solvent viscosity enhances the diffusion rates of analytes into the solvent, enabling a much more efcient and faster extraction process. A variety of solvents can be utilized in the process; however strong acids or bases cannot be used. Advantages of ASE include time-efciency, less solvent consumption and better an- alyte recovery. In fact, it is recognized as a green extraction technique due to the lower consumption of organic solvents for extraction. The major limitations are requirement for an expensive lab equipment and unsuitability for thermally labile compounds. Thus, there are comparatively fewer applications of ASE in the eld of nutraceuticals. Some of these include catechin extraction from green tea, steroids from the leaves of Iochroma gesnerioides , terpenoids from tobacco, etc. [35,39]. 3.6. Hydro-Distillation Extraction Hydro distillation is most widely used for essential oil extraction. It may be in the form of water distillation, water-steam distillation, or steam distillation. For example, steam distillation is used in the extraction of essential oils in saffron [ 61]. Hydro-diffusion, hydrol- ysis, and heat decomposition are the processes involved in this methodology. This process cannot be employed in the extraction of thermo-labile compounds [ 62,63]. The process is carried out in an apparatus called the Clevenger apparatus. When heat or direct steam is applied, the sample solvent mixture placed in a closed chamber vaporizes, and the vapor causes bursting of small sacs containing essential oils. Upon condensation, oils areSeparations 2023 ,10, 177 14 of 28 separated from the water by a density-based separator. The process should be done within a specic duration to ensure complete extraction of oil components. The advantages of this process include cost effectiveness as it requires only water as a solvent. The major disadvantages are the long extraction time, degradation of the compounds, and alterations in the chemical structures [49,64]. 3.7. Ultra High-Pressure Extraction (UPE) UPE is one of the most prominent environment friendly technologies that employs super-high pressure (100 to 1000 MPa) and a mild temperature (20-50\u000eC), enabling the enhanced extraction of thermolabile bioactive compounds. The ultrahigh pressure leads to increased mass transfer rates and induces a greater penetration of solvents, causing the rupture of cellular walls, membranes, and the organelles and thereby enhances the yield of bioactive principles. The raw materials along with solvents in a polythene bag are placed in a pressure vessel. Subsequently, a high pressure is applied at room temperature using an ultrahigh pressure booster pump for 5 to 15 min. Then, the mixture is concentrated using a rotary evaporator. The major advantages of UPE lie in its short extraction time, increased extraction yields, decreased consumption of solvents, and enhanced quality of the extract. However, impurities inthe extract are the major drawback of this method. It was reported that high pressure extraction method, when compared to other methods, such as heat reflux extraction and ultrasonic extraction, gave the shortest time (ca. 1 min) for 30% polyphenols extraction from green tea leaves in water [65]. 3.8. Enzyme-Assisted Extraction (EAE) EAE is a sustainable extraction technique and is highly efcient. Enzymes are biologi- cal catalysts with high specicity and selectivity, enabling the extraction of various bioactive compounds by promoting hydrolysis of plant cell walls, thereby signicantly increasing the extraction yield. The efciency of this process depends greatly on several parame- ters, such as temperature, pH, extraction time, and enzyme concentration. The substrate and its bonding with the components of the cells determine the enzyme type to be used. It was reported that EAE of grape skins can yield high-quality bioactive polyphenols, such as anthocyanins and resveratrol [ 66]. Similarly, notable enhancement of extraction yield was reported by enzyme-assisted extraction of curcumin from turmeric using a mixture of -amylase and amyloglucosidase enzymes [67]. The major advantages of EAE are its high yield with a much higher purity, reduced time of extraction, and diminished solvent requirement. The major limitations are the cost and availability of the enzymes required [68]. 3.9. Pulse Electric Field Extraction (PEF) The pulsed electric eld (PEF) technology is another non-thermal processing method that induces cell membrane permeabilization by using the transmembrane potential across cell membranes, resulting in increased permeability and conductivity. The PEF technique is used to create pores in the cell membranes, which allows large molecules to be transferred across the cell membrane. An optimized pulsed electric eld is applied to the sample for enhanced extraction, resulting in reversible electroporation of the cell membranes and aiding easy mass transfer of compounds through the pores into the surrounding medium. The major advantages of PEF-assisted extraction are its high extract yield, low energy consumption, and shorter treatment time. In addition, using a square wave with larger pulse width can help in saving the energy requirements for the process. Reports show that PEF technology can give enhanced yield in the extraction of intracellular bioactive lycopene, etc. from different plant sources. It has also been observed that polyphenols extracted from red grape show the highest yields regarding the eld strength [69].Separations 2023 ,10, 177 15 of 28 4. Purication and Characterization of Bioactive Compounds Once the extraction is done, the next step is the purification of the bioactive compounds of interest from the extract. Column chromatography can be employed as a simple technique for purification purposes. Complex protocols, such as high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), can accelerate the process and are more efficient. However, column chromatography and thin-layer chromatography remain the methods of choice for many bioactive com- pounds because of their simplicity, cost-efciency, and the ease of availability of stationary phase materials, such as alumina, cellulose, silica, etc. Multiple mobile phases with varied polarity can be utilized in the case of separation of complex component mixtures [64,70]. In many drug development initiatives, the screening of natural products for the dis- covery of novel physiologically active metabolites has been a crucial step. The same applies for the discovery of nutraceuticals. The following discussion covers a few of the current methods for identication, purication, and phytochemical analysis of physiologically active components. 4.1. Ultraltration Combinatorial libraries have been tested using the ultraltration HPLC-MS technique to look for novel therapeutic leads. This technique is largely used to separate active substances for synthetic or combinatorial libraries and to evaluate the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of their ligand-protein binding abilities. The technique has recently been in widespread use for the detection and identication of active chemicals in plant extracts [ 71]. Because ultraltration requires less energy than thermal separation techniques, it may be a desirable concentration alternative in many applications [72]. 4.2. Bioafnity Chromatography (BAC) Bioafnity chromatography (BAC) helps in identifying potential therapeutic molecules based upon their ability to bind to certain biologically relevant ligands. The targets corre- sponding to the pharmacologically active molecules are adhered as the stationary phase in the chromatographic plates. For the investigation of natural products, three BAC modes\u2014 conventional BAC mode, solid phase extraction (SPE) mode, and immobilized enzyme reactors (IMERs) mode\u2014have been frequently used [ 73]. The difference in analyte reten- tion periods on the chromatographic columns is the foundation of the traditional BAC mode. However, most of the natural product extracts contain lower concentrations of the biologically signicant compound. Here, solid phase extraction becomes signicant [ 74]. Immobilized enzyme reactors (IMERs) can be employed when enzymes are being used as the target. They can simultaneously assess the bioactivity of natural product extracts by measuring changes in enzyme activity [75]. 4.3. Cell Membrane Chromatography (CMC) Membrane receptors interact with their ligands in a specic manner inside the body. This specic interaction is the basis for the technique known as cell membrane chromatog- raphy (CMC). Therefore, the CMC approach aids in purication of the specic target molecules from a complex sample [ 21]. CMC rapidly screens complicated samples based on the afnity between a phytomedicine and a membrane receptor. As a result, CMC offers an efcient analytical technique for target identication in complicated samples, drug quality control, drug mechanism research, and new drug discovery [76]. 4.4. Ligand Fishing The protein-coated beads are submerged into the extract using this method, and any substances that have an afnity for the immobilized protein are retained while non- binders are left in the supernatant. This method enables the identication and detec- tion of novel potential therapeutics when combined with chromatographic and spectro- scopic methods. This technique is aptly named the ligand shing screening method [ 71]. The majority of ligand shing techniques exhibit great efciency, specicity, and minimalSeparations 2023 ,10, 177 16 of 28 sample pretreatment, which makes them particularly well-suited for identifying active ingredients in complicated mixtures of natural materials. The two types of ligand shing techniques are online and offline. Active substances that have been trapped on the sta- tionary phase by immobilized biomolecules, such as metabolites, enzymes, or receptors must rst be rinsed off before being analyzed in the off-line mode. After the bio-extraction process, the incubated sample solution is directly examined by chromatographic methods in on-line mode, and the active components in the mixture can be inferred inferentially by comparing the chromatograms of the original sample [77]. 5. Herbal Nutraceuticals in Market Commercialization of herbal and dietary supplements has been on the rise for the last few decades all around the globe, including in India (Table 2). Consumers may be young adults who are into sports, muscle building, and toning of the body that requires the consumption of protein and other supplements. Dietitians also recommend the use of certain nutraceuticals for their therapeutic effect on various diseases, diabetes, kidney disorders, anemia etc. According to the growing market, there is a high demand for fat burners, multivitamins, and branched- chain amino acids (BCAA). The main category of nutraceuticals are organic foods, which are particularly prominent in the increasing population leading sedentary lifestyles [ 78]. This field is further anticipated to bring new products based on the customer interests. The global nutraceuticals market in 2016 was valued at approximately USD 383 billion and by 2022 it is expected to reach USD 561 billion [ 79]. The herbal and dietary supplement industry is said to have an estimated growth of USD 50 billion in countries such as USA and Canada. The growth in dietary supplements is estimated to increase 19.5% and that of herbal products to 11.6%. To meet the increasing demands of proper diet and healthy nutrition, foods are set to become more attractive and fortied in order to eradicate malnutrition in the coming future [ 80]. Thus, the Indian nutraceuticals market was expected to show an increase of 20% by 2020 with sale values up to USD 6.4 billion. While, India constitutes only 2% of the global nutraceutical products based on the per capita spent as per the report of Assocham, functional foods such as beverages including antioxidant supplements may elicit increased demand in the Indian market [78].

A summary of beneficial and adverse effects of nutraceuticals. 6.1. Diabetes Diabetes is a metabolic illness which occurs when the body either produces insufficient insulin or cannot use it as effectively as it should. It affects approximately 422 million individuals globally. Furthermore, diabetes is directly responsible for 1.5 million fatalities annually. In advance of World Diab etes Day, the WHO published a report that details the disturbing state of insulin and diabetes care access globally and concluded that Figure 2.

Diabetes Diabetes is a metabolic illness which occurs when the body either produces insufcient insulin or cannot use it as effectively as it should. It affects approximately 422 million individuals globally. Furthermore, diabetes is directly responsible for 1.5 million fatalities annually. In advance of World Diabetes Day, the WHO published a report that details the disturbing state of insulin and diabetes care access globally and concluded that the main barriers to widespread access are high prices, scarcity of human insulin supply, insulin market dominated by a few manufacturers, and subpar health systems. The overall con- clusion from the research to date suggests that plant-based diets provide a rich source of minerals, vitamins, and phytochemicals, many of which have anti-diabetic properties. Furthermore, taking such meals reduces the negative effects of synthetic chemical medi- cations [ 82]. Genistein, an essential nutraceutical molecule present in soybean seeds, has been discovered to be an effective drug for managing diabetes. According to in vitro inves- tigations, genistein boosted insulin secretion in a line, MIN-6 cells; and in cultured islets from mice and rats [ 83]. In a human study, genistein treatment improved insulin sensitivity scores in postmenopausal women. A daily dose of 54 mg of the compound raised glucose tolerance and improved insulin sensitivity while lowering fasting blood sugar [ 84]. According to an animal study, grape seed proanthocyanidin extracts can considerably lower blood glucose levels in type 2 diabetic rats [ 85]. However, proanthocyanidins isolated from the rhizome of Fagopyrum grape seed proanthocyanidins in anti-diabetic action [ 86]. In several nations, diabetics have been reported to be treated using sage ( Salvia ofcinalis ).Salvia ofcinalis extract is demonstrated to have anti-diabetic properties, which can be attributed to its ability to activate the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) [87]. 6.2. Obesity The abnormal or excessive accumulation of fat that is associated with obesity is a serious condition affecting people all over the world. Many plants, plant extracts, and chemicals produced from plants are being researched for their potential health benets against obesity and liver disorders. The most prevalent liver disease in Western nations is non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is linked to obesity. According to scientic research, Lamiaceae plants may be an affordable source of nutraceuticals and phytochemi- cals that can be used to treat metabolic-related diseases and ofcinalis ) India its medicinal properties. E. ofcinalis consumption reduced liver triacylglycerol and cholesterol levels. It reduces oxidative stress by reversing hyperlipidemia associated with aging. Additionally, studies show that oral delivery of amla results in signicant drop in total cholesterol (TC). It was also found to increase the levels of high-density lipoprotein [ 89].Salvia ofcinalis L. shown signicant lipase inhibition and a considerable reduction in serum triglyceride levels, resulting in robust benecial effects on body weight and obe- sity [ 90]. An animal study proposed that activating TRPV1 channels with dietary capsaicin may result in browning of white adipose tissue (WAT) to combat obesity [ 91]. Additionally, dietary capsaicin diminishes the risk for hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance brought on by obesity in mice [ 92]. In in vitro tests, it was discovered that green tea extract AR25 (Exolise) exerted a direct inhibition of stomach and pancreatic lipases and an activation of thermogenesis, making it a suitable natural product for the treatment of obesity [93]. 6.3. Immunomodulation Immunomodulators enhance the body's defense against infectious diseases and in- juries. Plant-derived nutraceuticals have been proven to have immunomodulatory prop- erties. Rosmanol, a sage and rosemary extract, has anti-inflammatory effects. It acts by blocking the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF- \u0014B) activation [ 94]. Numerous studies conducted over the past two decades have revealed that curcumin with a variety of biological targets, exerts its anti-Separations 2023 ,10, 177 19 of 28 inflammatory actions by suppressing the expression of inflammatory transcription factors (such as NF- \u0014B), enzymes (such as cyclooxygenases, COX-2 carvacrol have also been investigated and found to increase the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin IL-10, while IL-6) in vitro [96]. 6.4. Dementia With more people being diagnosed with dementia, it is not unexpected that more over- the-counter medications and nutraceuticals are being used to treat such cognitive issues. Eight commercially available terpenoids from Salvia lavandulaefolia have had their in vitro anti-acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities examined. The ndings demonstrate that the oil's inhibitory function is the consequence of a complex interplay between its constituent terpenes, which can have both synergistic and antagonistic effects [ 97]. Sage boosts memory in both young and old people, and a randomized controlled experiment demonstrates its positive cognitive and behavioral effects [ 98]. Traditional Chinese medicine has employed the moss Huperzia serrata to treat and prevent dementia. It has huperzine A, an effective anti-AChE alkaloid with prominent neuroprotective properties [ 99]. Caffeine from coffee is a neuroprotective that can potentially reverse memory loss, lower brain beta-amyloid levels in vivo , and can stimulate the central nervous system [ 100]. Lesser periwinkle (Vinca minor L.) has been shown to enhance blood flow to the brain, and vinpocetine, a synthetic vincamine alkaloid derivative, has been shown to elicit signicant neuroprotective qualities. Vinpocetine has also produced some encouraging clinical trial results with regards to cognitive improvement in dementia patients. Indeed, the major metabolite of vinpocetine, cis-apovincaminic acid (cAVA), has multimodal neuroprotective effects [101]. 6.5. Hypertension The worldwide epidemic of hypertension is one of the most signicant causes of serious health concerns. Numerous studies have suggested links between certain dietary components and lowering hypertension. Sour tea ( Hibiscus sabdariffa ) L-ascorbic acid, beta-carotene, pectin, and wax, which play a vital part in decreasing blood pressure. Pre-clinical animal studies have demonstrated that consuming Hibiscus sabdariffa extract lowers blood pressure in a dose-dependent way [ 102]. Ginger used as a supplement has a considerable benecial impact on endothelial function and blood pressure [ 103]. Adding ginger to the diet in amounts of 2-6 g/day has been suggested to signicantly lower blood pressure [ 104]. Low density lipoprotein (LDL) and cholesterol levels are also reduced. Additionally, ginger provides a lot of potassium, which is crucial for controlling blood pressure [ 105]. Recent investigations have shown that saffron's antioxidant and radical scavenger actions underlie its cardioprotective qualities [ 106]. In hypertensive rats, saffron (200 mg/kg/day) supplementation for ve weeks can prevent blood pressure increases and induce aortic remodeling [ 107]. Cinnamon is also useful in treating heart disease, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. It has been shown to lower blood pressure and glucose levels in rodent models [ 108]. In addition, cinnamon's polyphenols help improve insulin sensitivity, which is implicated in blood pressure regulation [109]. 6.6. Antimicrobial Activity According to experimental data, tannins and other phytochemicals from Samanea saman pod may include substantial natural antimicrobials and antifungals that might be used in the production of tannins or energy-rich nutraceutical tea formulations was tested against respiratory-tract pathogens in a study, and the results show that larch bark extract (LBE) had stronger antimicrobial activity than grapefruit seed extract. LBE phytochemicals can therefore be employed as active antibacterials in nutraceutical formulations [ 111]. Quercetin isSeparations 2023 ,10, 177 20 of 28 a flavonoid found primarily in vegetables and fruits that has antiviral, anti-atopic, pro- metabolic, and anti-inflammatory properties. Quercetin's ability to interfere with SARS- CoV-2 replication has been demonstrated using computer modeling in a study aimed at the discovery of candidate chemicals displaying potential efcacy against SARS-CoV-2 viral targets [ 112]. In a broad-spectrum activity evaluation of diverse nutraceutical plant extracts, Psidium guajava demonstrated the best antibacterial activity and may be a promising can- didate in the quest for effective and efcient antimicrobial agents [ 113].In vitro tests of Thymus vulgaris essential oil demonstrated very signicant bactericidal and antifungal activity, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) ranging from 75 to 1100 g/mL and 80 and 97 g/mL, respectively. The plant could therefore be regarded as another ap- propriate natural source for nutraceutical formulations. It can also be used in conjunction with antibiotics as a synergistic agent or as a natural antibacterial and fungicidal [ 114]. Apigenin, a compound found In a double-blind, placebo-controlled research, total cholesterol concentrations were found to have dropped considerably in the red-yeast-rice-treated group when compared to the placebo-treated group [ 116]. Berberine, an isoquinoline alkaloid found in many medicinal plants including Coptis chinensis may lower plasma lipids by decreasing the production of hepatic cholesterol and triglycerides, potentially by activating AMP-activated protein kinase, which then inactivates -hydroxy -methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG- CoA) reductase [ 117]. Human blood lipid concentrations and soy protein intake were compared in a meta-analysis of 38 subjects in a controlled clinical trial study. The ndings showed that consuming soy protein as opposed to animal protein signicantly reduced serum levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol without signicantly influencing levels of HDL cholesterol [ 118]. The effects of the herbal drink derived from the plant tiwai ( Eleutherine americana Merr. ) on individuals with hypercholesterolemia's lipid proles were examined in a clinical trial. According to the ndings, consuming tiwai herbal drink for seven days could lower total cholesterol by 5.33 mg/dL compared to the control [ 119]. Meta-analysis has also been performed to evaluate the effects of tree nuts on blood lipids. As per the ndings, eating tree nuts reduces triglycerides, apolipoprotein B (ApoB), LDL cholesterol, and total cholesterol. Further, nut dose, not the nut type, appears to be the main factor in decreasing cholesterol [120]. 7. Negative Impact of Herbal Nutraceuticals Herbal medications and supplements have been used by people as their primary source of healthcare to treat various illnesses. It was found that sales of herbal supplements in the US grew from 8.8 billion in 1994 to 18.8 billion in 2003; and it is expected to increase further [ 121]. Unfortunately, the notion that herbal dietary products are natural and safe in all doses, and the lack of information regarding the composition of these supplements have led people to adopt detrimental self-medication regimens. This inappropriate use of supple- ments can lead to several toxicities, such as hepatotoxicity, pulmonary toxicity, cytotoxicity, carcinogenicity, nephrotoxicity, hematotoxicity, and cardiac toxicity (Figure 2) [122]. 7.1. Hepatotoxicity Herbal and dietary supplements (HDS) have been linked to liver damage, which appears to be amongst the most common side effect [ 123]. Hepatotoxicity is mainly caused due to the presence of compounds, such as pyrrolizidine alkaloids of comfrey, I It is observable as hepatocellular, cholestasis, or a mix of both patterns, which are similar to the injury caused by drug overuse. The frequency of liver injury is higher in patients using HDS than the conventional medications according to some prospective and retrospectiveSeparations 2023 ,10, 177 21 of 28 studies. The need for liver transplantation is more evidently seen in liver injury caused by HDS [ 124]. There is a broad spectrum of clinical characteristics that result from liver toxicity due to HDS, which includes autoimmune disorders, cirrhosis, hepatic brosis, necrosis, and cholestasis. Young and middle-aged patients with HDS-linked hepatotoxicity are more prevalent since they consume certain HDS to burn fat, lose weight, and as body building supplements. HDS-associated hepatotoxicity can vary from mild liver injury to severe acute liver failure. Furthermore, 88% of patients in the US Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) network showed mild to moderate severity whereas severe to fatal conditions were elicited by 12% of the respondents. Most patients were female in the age range of 48 to 53 [124]. 7.2. Pulmonary Toxicity The injudicious continual use of herbal and dietary supplements has been reported to cause lung cancer. In research conducted on 77,125 patients with HDS regimens, 665 subjects developed lung cancer. The majority of them were males with an average age of 70 years and above. Fish oil, garlic pills, Gingko biloba , ginseng, grape seed, glucosamine, methylsulfonylmethane, St. John's and saw palmetto were the major herbal addi- tives used by these alkaloid identied as monocrotaline (MCT) has been evidenced to cause pulmonary disorders, which include vascular syndrome with pulmonary vasculitis and hypertension in rats. The pathogenesis of MCT-induced pulmonary toxicity is hypothesized based on suggestions that MCT be- comes a reactive compound in the liver which is then transported in the blood to reach and cause injury to endothelial cells of the lung [125]. 7.3. Carcinogenicity Many herbal products claimed to be safe for users, tend to either directly cause carcinogenicity or disturb the cellular homeostasis. A study was conducted in which 30 herbal compounds posed a potential carcinogenic risk for humans. Most of these compounds are alkylbenzenes or unsaturated pyrrolizidine alkaloids, or safrole, which showcased the need for higher priority of risk management [ 126]. Another herbal medicine called comfrey contains 14 pyrrolizidine alkaloids, which may cause carcinogenicity in experimental animals. Studies suggest that certain phytochemicals potentially interact with the genetic material of the endothelial cells and induce cancer development [127]. 7.4. Nephrotoxicity Nephrotoxicity is one of the side effects related to the usage of HDS, which is mainly attributed to Chinese herbs. A few underlying causes of kidney injury are its high metabolic activity, relatively high blood flow, and glomerular reabsorption by the renal tubules, which allows the accumulation of toxic compound inside the cells. Adulteration of potentially detrimental herbal supplements with contaminants, such as dichromate, cadmium, and phenylbutazone may also contribute to nephrotoxicity. The Aristolochiaceae plant family con- tains plants having aristolochic acid, which is associated with the development of cancers and nephropathy (aristolochic acid nephropathy or AAN). AAN is prominently associated with some Chinese herbs. The mechanisms of AAN have been studied using cellular and animal models. According to these studies, AA interacts with oxidases of NADPH or anti- oxidative enzymes to induce oxidative stress in the kidney. It may also cause mitochondrial damage and induce apoptosis in renal tubule cells due to mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum dysfunction, damage to DNA, or due to the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway activation. Induction of pro-inflammatory signaling is another pathway of AAN [128]. 7.5. Cardiac Toxicity HDS that are used to treat cardiovascular diseases may also induce a range of side effects. For instance, in the USA, ephedra was banned in 2004 due to numerous casesSeparations 2023 ,10, 177 22 of 28 of serious cardiovascular side effects, which included infarction, stroke, and even death. Bitter orange is another stimulant that increases heart beat in healthy individuals up to ten beats per minute. It also increases blood pressure in healthy individuals by 9-10 mm Hg when combined with caffeine. Non-stimulant herbal products, such as licorice, may lead to ventricular arrhythmias. Some herbs, such as foxglove, oleander, and squill, contain cardiac glycosides and may lead to digitoxin-type toxicity [129]. 8. Safety, Quality and Regulatory Aspects of Herbal Nutraceuticals The usage of herbal medicine and dietary supplements is on the rise at the global level. In some places, these are used as medication whereas in others, they may be employed as additives to enhance overall well-being [ 130]. Such herbal remedies are classied as food supplements by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and have different regula- tions when compared to the laws governing conventional foods and drugs. Unlike the market drugs, herbal and dietary supplements do not undergo the stringent FDA drug approval process. Only supplements that are adulterated or misbranded are prohibited by the FDA from being marketed. Since 2004, around half of the class 1 drugs have been recalled as they were found to be adulterated dietary supplements contaminated with banned ingredients. Studies on safety, efcacy, and scientic evidence of such products are very limited and little incentive is given by the government for conducting varied and randomized controlled trials. Therefore, there is no legal provision that allows the FDA to examine and sanction herbal supplements. Some frequently used supplements that are known to produce mild to severe side effects are echinacea, garlic, ginkgo, and St. John's wort, which can lead to detrimental interactions between herbal products and drugs [ 131]. Herbal supplements exist either as crude extracts or as commercial products consist- ing of roots, leaves, seeds, or tea, which are mainly used in under-developed countries. These components are mixed to form concoctions containing harmful contaminants, such as heavy metals, corticosteroids, and other banned ingredients. Moreover, commercial dietary supplements in the form of tablets often vary in their constituents and concentrations from batch to batch and also between different manufacturers. Even though known active compounds are standardized, their combination with other compounds may affect the bioavailability and pharmacological interactions in humans [132]. One of the regulatory bodies for HDS, the Dietary Supplement Health and Educa- tion Act (DSHEA), was formed in 1994 and an additional guideline for \"Current Good Manufacturing Practices for Dietary Supplements\" was fomented in 2007. DSHEA's ob- jective is to build a structure that can balance benets and risks of HDS, while providing customers with continuous access and affordability. FDA warnings have been imposed on several products which caused liver injury or failure, such as OxyElite Pro, since the advent of these regulations. According to the DSHEA, a dietary supplement is facilitated to supplement or complement but not to substitute or replace diet [ 124]. Herbal supplements are regulated and monitored in the European Union (EU) under the Traditional Herbals Medicine Products Directive 2004/24/EC. Following this regulation, only if a product has been proven to be used safely for a sufcient amount of time of over 30 years with 15 years of use within the EU, can it be registered through a simple process and may not necessitate any medical prescription. The European Food Safety Authority (AFSA) regulates vitamins and mineral food supplements according to Directive 2002/46/EC while the Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products (HMPC) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) monitors herbal medicinal products. However, many dietary supplements can be bought online without proper legal clearance which makes its more complicated to correctly identify the manufacturers [133]. To reduce the risks and toxicity related issues, patients or consumers need to be ed- ucated about the proper usage of HDS. It should be made clear that not all herbs, and all doses, are free from risk and all the consumers including patients should have in- formation regarding the potential risks and benets associated with any such additives. HDS should be treated as medicinal products so that they may not be consumed care-Separations 2023 ,10, 177 23 of 28 lessly and injudiciously. Anything consumed at more than the necessary dose may lead to calamities; therefore, the consumers should never assume that nutraceuticals are an exception. It is advisable to thoroughly consult physicians, especially if the consumers are on allopathic medication. In the unfortunate event of development of any HDS- linked side effects, the consumers should be advised to halt the regimen immediately. Further, the consumers should be educated to purchase nutraceuticals and related products only from trusted and reputed sources. However, in this respect, it should be noted that, in most cases, the prices of the products are not directly correlated with the quality of the products. Lastly, for consumers who are being nursed or are pregnant or nursing, HDS usage is not recommended unless advised by the health care provider(s). In addition, infants and children may not be advised not to use these supplements [134]. 9. Conclusions Derived from plant sources, nutraceuticals are known to provide health benets including the prevention or treatment of disease. The herbal nutraceutical market has been on the rise for the last few decades around the world including in India due to their perceived therapeutic effect and with the increase in the public inclination towards sports, muscle building and body toning. This review provides a thorough insight into the medicinal properties of nutraceuticals derived from various herbs/plants, and the different approaches to extract and purify them. Foremost sources of these compounds including herbs, such as aloe vera, anise, bay, caraway, dill, holy basil, thyme, saffron, sage, etc., which entail major portions of bioactive components aiding their functional potential were discussed. Bioactivity of these operational components is greatly reliant on different extraction techniques for acquiring high quality and yield of these compounds in a time effective manner. Extraction methodologies range from the traditional Soxhlet extraction method to more recently developed techniques, such as supercritical fluid extraction, microwave assisted extraction, etc. Safeguarding the potential components is feasible with the selection of appropriate extraction technique followed by purication of bioactive components of interest. These strategies were discussed in detail. There is an ever-increasing global market for nutraceuticals, which is anticipated to flourish to USD 561 billion and more in the coming years. With Indian markets contributing only 2% of the global market, there is a need for enhanced fabrication to meet the rising demand. Herbal nutraceuticals aid in advocating and enduring quality of life by overseeing the issues related to widespread human diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, etc. With various formulations of herbal nutraceuticals available in the market, it is crucial to have awareness about both their positive and ill effects. In this regard, future work must concentrate on both ascertaining the therapeutic actions of different bioactive compounds from the herbs, as well as on exploring strategies to identify and minimize the adverse effects associated with herbal nutraceuticals.
