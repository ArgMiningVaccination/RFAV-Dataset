Did you know that allergies, besides making you feel miserable, can affect your overall health? When your immune system is being over-taxed fighting allergens, your risk for other health problems increases. Medicines, while providing temporary relief, only mask the symptoms. Natural treatments such as allergy immunotherapy and IV vitamin drips help you to actually overcome allergies. First, allergies need to be properly pinpointed. From tree pollens, weeds and grass, to animal dander, molds and fungi, to food intolerances and sensitivities, the culprits need to be accurately identified through scratch tests and blood tests. Secondly, treatments need to be customized to your specific allergens. Allergy immunotherapy stimulates your immune system to build resistance to the allergens so symptoms diminish over time. Finally, your immune system needs to be strengthened. IV vitamin drips build up the immune system and boost energy levels by delivering premium nutrients, vitamins and minerals directly into the bloodstream. Scratch Test, Blood Work Provide Accurate Diagnosis Testing many different potential allergens gives a truer perspective of what your actual allergens and sensitivities are. The scratch test combined with blood work will provide a thorough assessment. The [allergy scratch test](/allergy) is a painless application, where drops of suspected allergens are placed on the surface of the skin. The process only takes about 15 minutes because many allergens are tested at the same time. If you are allergic to any of the tests, redness and/or a small bump will appear on the specific area, enabling the medical professional to make the correct diagnosis. Comprehensive blood work will reveal allergens as well as sensitivities, and provides a good cross-check for immune triggers. How Allergy Immunotherapy Works [Allergy immunotherapy](/allergy) works by injecting small amounts of the determined allergens. The injections are easy enough to do yourself. This immunotherapy stimulates your immune system to build up tolerance, causing your allergy symptoms to diminish over time. Made of naturally derived serums, the injections contain just enough allergens to stimulate your immune system, but not enough to cause a significant allergic reaction. The treatment also helps to reduce inflammation. Usually an individual can obtain significant relief and freedom from the allergens within a few months. Vitamin Therapy Boosts Immunity Studies show that [IV vitamin drips](/iv-drips) reduce allergy symptoms and inflammation while strengthening the immune system. High doses of vitamin C, which is nature's antihistamine, along with zinc and magnesium, both integral to building healthy immune systems, are particularly beneficial. [Glutathione IV pushes](/iv-pushes) are also effective in treating allergies. The body's master antioxidant, glutathione is in every cell of the human body and has great restorative as well as preventative capabilities. Much higher doses of vitamins and minerals can be given intravenously than can be taken orally. The absorption level of IV vitamins is superior because they go directly into the bloodstream. In addition, fluid from [IV drips](/iv-drips) provides necessary hydration and helps to flush toxins from the body.
