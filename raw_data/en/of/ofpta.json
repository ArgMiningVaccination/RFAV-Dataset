Verywell Health / Alli Waataja The use of essential oils is a much talked about trend these days, but aromatherapy techniques have been used for almost 6,000 years in countries like India, China, and Egypt. Essential oils are derived from flowers, roots, leaves, stems, and sometimes fruit. Aromatherapy has been studied in more recent years to determine its effects on the human brain and emotions, as well as its role in mood, alertness, and stress management. Research shows that various smells have a profound effect on mood swings and changes. It is believed that mood is a direct result of what the senses take in, and therefore the more pleasant the sensory experience, the more pleasant the mood. This is the theory behind pairing the use of aromatherapy and essential oils with other therapeutic techniques to help decrease symptoms of depression, anxiety, trauma, insomnia, racing thoughts, and even improve meditation practices. Essential oils can be used in several ways, including applied directly to the skin, in a bath, and in a diffuser. A good company will include educational information about how to use the oils, as well as be transparent about how their oils are processed. Look for pure oils extracted from organically grown plants and free from additives, which will be reflected in the price. A general practitioner from our Medical Expert Board reviewed the claims in this article around the uses for essential oils and considerations when shopping for them.

As a Licensed Mental Health Counselor, Mary K. Tatum, MS, LMHC, has worked with people struggling with depression, anxiety, and trauma for 17 years. Since going into private practice, she has always had either peppermint or lavender essential oils in her office. Mary chooses to use a diffuser in both the waiting room and the therapy office. The oil in the waiting room helps calm people before they begin to talk about difficult topics. She uses the scent of the oils in her therapy office to help with a technique called \"grounding,\" where the five senses help bring patients' focus away from trauma and into the \"here and now.\" Personally, she uses peppermint scented essential oils in a diffuser in her own home to help with focus when working and to maintain a serene mood. Serenity has been her daily mantra over the last year. 1 Source Verywell Health uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.
