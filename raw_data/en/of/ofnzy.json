These miraculous tasks are accomplished under the control of the nervous system, the master communication system of the entire body. Pregnancy Dr. Jaci quickly developed a passion for treating pregnant women, helping them to enjoy every step of their special journey through motherhood. Chiropractic treatments promote a healthy, stress-free pregnancy by alleviating joint pain, sciatica, muscle aches and nausea. Morning sickness plagues many pregnant women for a period of their pregnancies, and fortunately, Zofran isn't the only solution! Dr. Jaci is cognizant and well-trained to accommodate the special needs of pregnant women. She has a specialty certification in Webster Technique. Her treatments are modified to each and every pregnancy so that no pressure is applied to the abdomen. Misaligned joints may be caused by the massive changes that occur during a pregnancy. Weight gain, changes to the alignment of the pelvis, changes to posture, atrophy of core musculature and increased curvature of the back all contribute to pain and discomfort. Dr. Jaci's chiropractic and acupuncture treatments can be especially effective in reducing the effects of these physical stresses on the body. Stress to the uterus and its supporting ligaments may be reduced by establishing balance to the pelvis, most often accomplished with Webster Technique. Maintaining healthy spinal alignment will assist the body in functioning more effectively during this significant time of change, in addition, both support a healthier, easier birthing and labor process for mom and baby.

Dr. Jaco's knowledge and care of chiropractic and acupuncture help their tender bodies and nervous systems to properly respond to those stressors. As infants grow and develop, the function of their nervous systems parallels the function of their immune system. By relieving the nervous system of these stressors, it will allow the child to develop to the optimal health. A large body of research supports pediatric chiropractic and acupuncture care for children dealing with conditions like Colic, Asthma, Ear Infections, Bed Wetting, ADHD, Headaches, and many more.
