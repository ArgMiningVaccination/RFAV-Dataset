Experience Shirodhara - Balanced Mind Treatment A Shirodhara is a classic Ayurvedic body treatment. Ayurveda is an ancient science based on the principles of balancing and harmonizing the five elements of our bodies with the five elements found in nature. 'Shiro' in Sanskrit means head or forehead region and 'dhara' means a continuous flow, so Shirodhara translates to a continuous flow of warm herb infused oil on the forehead. The 75 minute treatment begins with a head, neck and shoulders massage to prepare you to receive Shirodhara. Herbally medicated oil chosen for your specific needs is then poured over the forehead in a unique ancient flow pattern for approximately thirty to 45 minutes to stimulate forehead nerves and balance the pituitary and pineal glands. The flow of oil on the head induces pleasurable sensations which can stimulate the production of serotonin. Following the oil flow, indulge in the silence and rest while receiving a final foot massage to complete the session. Shirodhara helps with improving insomnia, stress, depression, anxiety, PTSD, headaches and more. One may feel deeply relaxed and rejuvenated after their Shirodhara treatment. There may be a sense of clarity and peace that arises. 75 minutes $150. Several treatments within a short span of time can provide more long term benefits, as well as regular ongoing treatments. Packages Available in a Series of 3 Treatments for $400. This highly reduced rate is possible since we can re-use the oil for the 3 sessions. Email, text or call to purchase a package or purchase it in person when you come for your first session. This treatment can also be added on to your massage or bodywork session and you will see that option in the online scheduler as well. Email to find out if the treatment is appropriate for you if you have questions. Shirodhara is not recommended during times of nasal congestion or infection. Experience Abhyanga - Ayurvedic Oil Massage During the Abhyanga Massage, a classic Ayurvedic treatment, abundant, warm herbal oils nourish the tissues, calm the nerves, cleanse the lymph system and boost immunity. Abhyanga uses specific strokes to direct the proper flow of energy and friction strokes to help the oils penetrate into the deeper tissue to nourish them as well as loosen toxins. Abhyanga is very nourishing and grounding to the nervous system and excellent for times of stress and anxiety. Of course, it is also amazing for dry skin and dry seasons and for the nervous system. We will provide a warm towel to remove excess oil, but expect to be a bit oily. An ideal follow up would be a warm bath at home to allow the oils to penetrate even deeper before washing off the excess. The purpose of this treatment is to ground, slow down and rejuvenate the body and mind, so keeping silence during the treatment is ideal. It is recommended to avoid stimulating activities and screens for a bit after the treatment. A warm bath or shower is an ideal follow up. Abhyanga is beneficial for acute and chronic stress, anxiety, emotional trauma, insomnia, feelings of ungroundedness, nervous system conditions, aging and more. In Ayurveda, oil or \"sneha\" brings an insulating energy of love and comfort, so this massage is wonderful way to treat oneself to self love and self care. This is also an excellent replenishing treatment after childbirth. 75 minutes combines Shirodhara and Abhyanga for the ultimate in deep relaxation in this 2 hour treatment. The Abhyanga massage prepares the body and mind to fully receive the Shirodhara treatment, and calms the restlessness in the body and mind. The benefits of the Shirodhara are greatly enhanced when they follow the Abhyanga massage, when the body is already relaxed and in a more receptive state. Abhyanga soothes the restlessness in the body, while the Shirodhara soothes the restlessness in the mind. A series of Bliss Therapies or Shirodharas can have a powerful and lasting effect on the nervous system and may produce a deeper mental peace. Outcomes may vary but expect a deeply calming inner experience. The combination therapy is a 2 hour treatment. You will receive a head wrap to take home since your hair will be oily. It is recommended to go home after the treatment and take a warm bath or shower and avoid stimulating activities and screens and take a luxurious moment to slow down and full absorb the benefits. Enjoy! 2 "}
