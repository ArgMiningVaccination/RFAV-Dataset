In this regard, it could be that people simply imbue crystals with the ability to heal, which, in turn, means that they have some healing effect that we then ascribe to them. Although this is a circular argument, it does not take away from the fact that - for many people, at least - crystals are near-magical objects created by [nature](https://www.happiness.com/nature/) that can connect us to the Earth and the wider universe much more profoundly than, at first, might seem to be the case. Scientific research into healing crystals, like other alternative therapies, has little to say that supports the claims for the healing properties of gemstones, however. Consequently, it is largely a matter of faith whether you think crystals can heal or not. Despite some ethical concerns relating to crystal mining, healing crystals have become incredibly popular in recent decades and demand for them is high. As a result, many of the rarer and most sought-after healing crystals can be expensive. Choosing the right ones for you should be a carefully considered process, especially if you want to avoid ending up with a crystal that causes drowsiness, nausea or dizzy spells. Nevertheless, the power of healing crystals is something many people enjoy exploring. Indeed, to some people, using them to restore and heal becomes second nature and a part of their daily routine - whether or not their effects can be quantifiably measured by current scientific practices.
