It is both therapeutic and deeply relaxing. Crystals provide a non-invasive vibrational, energy-based system of wellbeing. Crystals absorb, focus and direct, detoxify, shift and diffuse energy as they interact with the electromagnetic forces and subtle vibrations within the subtle human or environmental energy field. Helps with: Pain Relief Mental clarity and focus Stress and Insomnia Trauma, self-worth and acceptance Goal setting and inspiration Detoxification and immune support ONE HOUR HEALING $120 WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS? Complementary and Alternative Medicine refers to illness and dis-ease as the final manifestation for spiritual, environmental, physiological, psychological, emotional, mental, karmic or ancestral imbalance or distress. Crystal Healing brings balance. Balance brings the mind, body, spirit and environment back into harmony, restoring the body's natural rhythm and equilibrium. It does not imply a cure. WHAT THE TREATMENT INVOLVES Placing Crystals on and around the physical body in geometric patterns to stimulate your own natural healing. Added depth and potency is given to your Crystal Healing with the inclusion of Crystal Ally Oracle Cards. Guidance from the Crystal Oracle includes metaphysical information, affirmations, meditations, and exercises for your ongoing personal growth, divination and healing. "}
