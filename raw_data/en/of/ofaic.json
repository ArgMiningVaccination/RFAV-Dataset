The program has been conducted during hemodialysis session. It will last for 12 weeks, with duration of 15 to 25 minutes, three times a week. | No Intervention: No Control Group | Initially this control group will wait and after 12 weeks this group will receive the intervention - Improvement of symptoms of depression, stress, quality of life, sleep disorders, biochemical parameters resulting from better adherence to treatment [ Time Frame: up to 12 months ] MAAS (Mindful Attention Awareness Scale): Self-report instrument that aims to measure individual differences in the frequency of states of consciousness and mind through time. The greater the more traces of attention (score 15-90). - Improvement of symptoms of quality of life [ Time Frame: up to 12 months ]KDQOL (Kidney Disease Quality of Life): Evaluates the perception of quality of life related to renal disease. The closer to 100 the better the perception of quality of life (Score 0-100 on each item- 24 items) - Improvement of symptoms of depression [ Time Frame: up to 12 months ] BDI (Beck Depression Inventory): From 10 to 18 = mild to moderate depression; From 19 to 29 = moderate to severe depression; From 30 to 63 = severe depression - Improvement of symptoms of sleep disorders [ Time Frame: up to 12 months ] PSQI (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index): Provides a measure of standardized sleep quality, the higher the score, the worse the quality of sleep, PSQI> 5 indicates that the individual is experiencing major difficulties in at least 2 components, or moderate difficulties in more than 3 components - Improvement of symptoms of stress [ Time Frame: up to 12 months ] PSS (Perceived Stress Scale): Evaluates perceived stress, the greater the more perceived stress (score 0-40). - Improve symptoms of depression and stress [ Time Frame: up to 12 months ] SCS (Self-Compassion Scale): The answers are given on a likert scale (1- \"almost never\" to 5 \"almost always\"), when the answers are not compassionate they must be calculated inversely. The scale is subdivided into 6 sub-scales of each of the three mechanisms in their positive and negative characteristics (mindfulness vs. over-identification, self-kindness versus self-judgment, and common humanity vs. isolation). \"Global self-pity scores were calculated by inversely encoding the items of self-judgment, isolation, and over-identification, adding up to the six sub-scales. - Assessment of comorbidities [ Time Frame: up to 12 months ]ICED (Index of coexistent diseases): The utilization of ICED enables stratifying the dialysis patients according to severity of their comorbidities and it is useful to identify the patients with a greater risk of death and hospitalization, as well as to aid in the forecast of and optimization of resources necessary for their treatment. The ICED aggregates the presence and severity of 19 medical conditions and 11 physical impairments within two scales: the Index of Disease Severity (IDS) and the Index of Physical Impairment (IPI). The final ICED score is determined by an algorithm combining the peak scores for the IDS and IPI. The range of the ICED is from 0 to 3, reflecting increasing severity ( 0 - normal, 1 - mild, 2- moderate, 3- severe). Choosing to participate in a study is an important personal decision.
