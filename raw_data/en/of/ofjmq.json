Its incidence has increased by 8% in 2020 compared to 2019 according to the National Cancer Registry 2020. It is the leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for nearly 10 million deaths in 2020 and is the third cause of death in Mauritius, representing 12.8% of total death s. Government has a three -fold objective to address this challenge: cure cancer patients, prolong thei r life and ensure them a good quality of life, through early screening, education, prevention and appropriate treatment . The attainment of this objective requires modern cancer services geared towards providing evidence - based care that is effective, safe , of high quality and patient centered, supported by international standards and clinical guidelines. Government is committed to upgrade cancer care and treatment in line with international recognized Cancer Centres. In this endeavour, it has invested heavi ly in a state -of-the-art modern cancer hospital, equipped with the latest technologies. This hospital will be an all -inclusive Care Centre. Since 2020, chemotherapy and palliative care services have already been transferred to the renovated building in the National Cancer Hospital at Solferino. This facility is expected to be fully operational by 2023. As the incidence and prevalence of cancer are soaring , my Ministry has come forward with a National Cancer Control Programme ( NCC P) with a view to coming up with a holistic, well -structured programme for cancer prevention , early diagnosis, treatment, palliative care as well as research. The NCC P has taken into account both internal and external factors including ageing population, climate change, industriali sation, pollution, change in lifestyle , amongst others , in devising the most appropriate strategies . The NCC P purports to address the needs and requirements of all stakeholders who are involved in cancer care at all levels . Prevention is also a key componen t of any overall cancer control plan. 40% of cancers can also be avoided by adopting a healthy lifestyle, a balanced diet, regular physical activity, refraining from cigarettes smoking, consuming alcohol in moderation and avoiding exposure to harmful chemi cals, amongst others. Further, early diagnosis through screening activities leads to a better overall survival rate and with the advent of modern technology and new targeted therapy, the quality of life of cancer patients can be greatly improved. The NCC P 2022 -2025, elaborated by my Ministry, harnesses Government's vision for the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health which is one of the fundamental rights of every human being and paves the way for a holistic, comprehensive cancer care and treatment strategy for the benefit of all cancer patients and society at large.

Globally, about 1 in 6 deaths is due to cancer. According to the WHO in 2020, around 10 million people were diagnosed with cancer, and it is expected that these figures will nearly double by the year 2040. Mauritius , over the past decades has experienced a gradual rise in the incidence of cancer : breast cancer is the most common malignancy in females, prostate cancer in males and acute leu kaemia in the p ediatric age group. Cancer, in 20 20, was the third cause of death among the Mauritian population , just after cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus . The economic burden borne by cancer is substantial ; it has a direct impact on health care expenditures, loss of productivity , reduced quality of life and premature death. The incidence of cancers is expected to rise with an upsurge in lifestyle -related cancer and an ageing population . It is, therefore, essential for healthcare policy make rs and society to produce and organize a plan of action to address cancer care in all its aspects. However, primary prevention can reduce 30% to 40% of all cancers. This can be achieved through health promotion and sensitization campaign on the risk facto rs for cancers such as smoking, harmful use of alcohol, unhealthy diet, sedentary lifestyles, obesity, excessive sun exposure, carcinogens at work, air pollution, infections with certain viruses and bacteria among others. On the other hand, secondary prev ention through s creening programmes of the targeted population for the common c ancers, namely breast, cervical and colorectal goes a long way in reducing morbidity and mortality among cancer patients . The Ministry of Health and Wellness has been constantl y improving on all the services delivered , to cancer patients. The NCC P 2022 -2025 has been developed to provide the strategic direction for a comprehensive cancer care and treatment , to patients, through health promotion and sensitization campaigns, screen ing activities, use of latest technology in treatment , palliative care modern infrastructure, enhanced skills and competencies of health personnel. This NCC P has prioritized the five common cancers in the Maur itian population, namely breast, cervical, co lorectal, prostate and lung cancers, without leaving behind the other cancers. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 12 NATIONAL CANCER CONTROL PROGRAMME 2022 -2025 Mauritius is an island situated in the middle of the Indian Ocean about 900 kilomet ers to the eas t of Madagascar and 180 kilomet ers to the northeast of R eunion Island. It is about 61 kilometers long and 45 kilomet ers wide with an area of 1,864 kilometres square. The Government of Mauritius provides free health care, at point of delivery, to its population which also covers the islands of Rodr igues and Agalega . The estimated resident population of the Island of Mauritius in 2019 was 1,221,663 (604,499 males and 617,164 females) compared to 1,222,208 in 2018 indicating a negative growth rate of 0.04%.

Death rate due to these non-communicable diseases were 595 per 100,000 population in 2019 as compared to 474 in 2010. Cancer of all sites taken together was in the third position with 1,441 (13.2%) deaths. The most recent summary statistics for cancer in Mauritius are displayed in table below. Cancer trends as per N ational Cancer Registry (2001 -2020) A National Cancer Registry has been maintained on a continuous basis since 1990, initially it was a Hospital -Based registry and was shifted to Population -Based Cancer Registry as from 2000 (PBCR) where all cases diagnosed by private pathologists were also included. As from 2001, dedicated computer software - CANREG 4 - customised by the IARC was in use to maintain the database which was migrated to the newer CANREG5 in 2016. Cancer surveillance is a key component of cancer control and the National Cancer Registry (NCR) provides an accurate picture of the occurrence of cancer in the Republic of Mauritius. The main objective of a cancer registry is to collect and classify information on all types of cancer in order to produce statistics on the occurrence of cancer in a defined population and to provide a frame work for assessing and controlling the impact of cancer on the community.

Amongst deaths (all causes) in 20 20, 1431 deaths were due to cancer. 676 deaths occurred in males whilst 755 deaths were noted in females. 6. In males, cancer of the prostate (n=104, 15.4%) is the leading cause of cancer deaths, followed by lung (n=10 2, 15.1%) and colo rectal cancer (n=74, 10.9 %). 7. In females breast cancer (n=184, 24.4 %) is still the main cause of cancer deaths followed by colo - rectal cancer (n=7 9, 10.5 %) and cervical cancer (n=76, 10.1 %). 8. The Mortality/Incidence (MI) ratios 0.56 for males and 0.45 for females. NATIONAL CANCER CONTROL PROGRAMME 2022 -2025 17 A National Cancer Control Programme ( NCC P) is defined as a public health programme designed to reduce cancer incidence and mortality and improve quality of life of cancer patients through the systematic and equitable implementation of evidence -based strategies for prevention, early detection, di agnosis, treatment and palliation by making use of the available resources and it is considered to be a key element in cancer control. The World Health Organisation identifies NCC Ps as the most appropriate mechanism for exploiting existing knowledge with the potential to save millions of lives (Ngoma 2006). National Cancer Control Programmes \"create multiple opportunities to change national experience from one of fear, loneliness and despair to one of knowledge, support and hope\" (True et al.2005). As per WHO , cancer control is an integral component of the path towards Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and the key recommendations are as follows: - Activate political will, strengthen governance and make a cancer control plan founded on UHC. Identify priorities that are feasible, evidence -based and can be financed. Focus on WHO \"best buys\" for NCD Primary prevention. Prioritise and invest in early diagnosis. Implement effective, feasible cancer management interventions, ensuring high -quality Value -based care. Palliative and survivorship care should be included in all NCC Ps. Strengthen information systems to improve planning and accountability. Fund priorities in cancer interventions and ensure financial protection. Optimise the work force and access to reliable, sustainable medicines and other products. What is a National Cancer Control Programme NATIONAL CANCER CONTROL PROGRAMME 2022 -2025 18 Aims of NCCP The aim of the NCC P is to lower the incidence of cancer, reduce morbidity and mortality indices for cancer through: - Enhanced health promotion and preventive activities Improved diagnostic facilities Holistic approach to cancer care and using the latest technology Objectives General Objectives Prevention of cancer through awareness programmes. Reduction of the mortality and morbidity indices. Provision of screening facilities to the population. Improving the quality of life of cancer patients through timely diagnosis, treatment and palliative care. Specific Objectives To determine the incidence and prevalence of cancer. To educate the population about cancer, primary and secondary prevention of cancer, the importance of early detection through screening, to recognise signs and symptoms of common cancer. To reduce mortality due to cancer by optimizing treatment. To improve the treatment outcome of cancer patients through timely diagnosis, treatment and palliation. To provide early diagnosis at primary level through educating healthcare professionals through regular seminars, Continuous Medical Education (CME) and workshops. To integrate oncology in the curriculum (syllabus/training) of medical and nursing students. To upgrade the existing oncological services with a special emphasis on new technologies in radiotherapy in line with Standard of Pr ocedures (SOP s) and departmental treatment protocols. To improve the quality of life of cancer patients with psychosocial and physical rehabilitation (palliative care). To further expand and develop palliative care from Hospital centered to community and domiciliary based . To ensure training (both formal and on the job) of all staff involved in cancer care. To increase the five -year survival rate in both sexes by aiming at early diagnosis and optimizing treatment. To set up a research unit in the field of oncology for better cancer control. To improve radiation safety measures in line with the Radiation Safety and Nuclear Security Authority. NATIONAL CANCER CONTROL PROGRAMME 2022 -2025 19 Methodology The NCC P has made use of both quantitative and qualitative data obtained from observation and analysis of the current situation of cancer care. The quantitative data was obtained from the National Cancer Registry 2020, Mauritius Health statistics 2019, NCD survey 2015 and WHO data. The recommendations of the IAEA following an imPACT mission in December 2018 have been included in the NCC P 2022 -2025 as well as those of other stakeholders obtained through several consultative meetings . Strategic Directions of the NCCP 2022-2025 This Strategic Plan has prioritized five most common cancer s occurring in the Mauritian population namely breast, colorectal, prostate, cervix and lung . Strategies will be develop ed to significantly reduce the morbidity and mortality due to cancer. The overall aim is to expand access to cancer awareness, prevention, early detection, treatment, palliative care and rese arch. Each general objective will have specific objectives and key strategies which will be translated into activities to guide the implementation of this plan. These strategic directions are based on a comprehensive approach using the \"Six Health System Building Blocks\" comprising : 1. Leadership and governance 2. Human Resource Planning 3. Medical products and Vaccines 4. Health information systems 5. Service delivery 6. Financing This Plan will address gaps in the cancer management and strives to engage all the stakeholders. It is essential to gear and adhere to this plan so that it can be successfully implemented by 2025. Leadership and Governance The Government of Mauritius has continued to provide appropriate leadership in the implementation of policies and strategies related to cancer . However, gaps in the cancer policy, regulatory, institutional and organizational frameworks will be addressed through this NCC P 2022 -2025 . Methodology and Strategic Directions NATIONAL CANCER CONTROL PROGRAMME 2022 -2025 20 Human Resource (HR) Planning Efficient Human Resource planning will enable the hospital to become a comprehensive cancer centre equipped with the appropriate number of qualified staff with the required competencies and skills . Medical Products and Vaccines Quality, efficacious, safe and affordable essential cancer medicines and medical supplies at all levels of service delivery, should be made available through an efficient effective procurement and logistics management. The safe admini stration of cytotoxic drugs will require trained pharmacists, doctors and nurses . Health Information Systems A population -based cancer registry is available since 1990. The Registry ensures availability of relevant, accurate, timely, and accessible cancer related data, to support the planning, coordination, monitoring and evaluation of cancer services. Strengthen a population -based cancer registry to further improve the usage of the cancer related information to support the programming of cancer services. Service Delivery The renovated building of the National Cancer Hospital is operational since October 2020. Treatment facilities (chemotherapy) are available at the National Cancer Hospital and the Radiotherapy Unit is at Victoria Hospital, Candos . The facility will be fully operational by 2023. Financing Public financial resources have been earmarked for this Plan and additional funds will be allocated as and when new services will be introduced. Stakeholders involved There are also many stakeholders who directly or indirectly contribute in cancer awareness programme s and measures to reduce the incidence of cancer . These include the Ministry of Education, Tertiary Education, Science and Technology, Ministry of Finance, Economic Planning and Development, Ministry of Social Integration, Social Security and National Solidarity , Ministry of Agro Industry and Food Security, Ministry of Gender Equality and Family Welfare , Radiation Safety and Nuclear Security Authority, Mauritius Institute of He alth, University of Mauritius and Non -Governmental Organisations (NGOs) . In the context of the development of the NCC P, the MOHW organised a multisectoral meeting including the above -mentioned stakeholders and recommendations made were included in th is NCC P. NATIONAL CANCER CONTROL PROGRAMME 2022 -2025 21 Implementation of the NCCP 2022 -2025 The increasing burden of cancer in Mauritius requires efficient planning and coordination to ensure adequate sensitization, health promotion, prevention and control of cancer. There is a strong need to set up a Nat ional Steering Committee to monitor, evaluate and implement actions taken for cancer control. Monitoring tools will have to be designed in collaboration with clinicians to be able to achieve quality and timely interventions. The implementation framework sh ould have both legal and regulatory frameworks. The NCC P will be implemented through the National Cancer Hospital (NCH ). The NCH will work closely with the Director Health Services, Non -Communicable Diseases and take the responsibility to coordinate all ac tivities and ensure implementation of the key strategies of this plan. Other stakeholders will also be involved in its implementation. To ensure the highest level of participation and accountability, the NCC P will be responsible for the management, impleme ntation and analysis of the NCC P 2022 -2025. Role of Civil Societ ies The Non -Governmental Organisations (NGOs) operating in the field of cancer, play a crucial role in providing support and care to cancer patients. They are engaged in primary and secondary prevention of cancer, provide psychological support and rehabilitation services. Cancer survivors who are me mbers of the civil societ ies can advise on all the aspects of cancer, by sharing their experiences with patients needing help from the time they are diagnosed and give psychological support during their treatment as well as rehabilitation. They can help to change the mindsets by being an example themselves. They have no bureaucratic barriers and help to fill the gaps. The civil societ ies in Mauritius has helped cancer patients by providing transport facilities to those on treatment, psychological support, breast prosthesis, awareness campaigns, etc. Their presence provides valuable support in the fight against cancer. They can further assist with domiciliary care in the field of palliative care. Situational Analysis on the role of stakeholders Stakeholders Role of Stakeh olders Current Status and future actions MOHW To provide comprehensive cancer care to the general population The Ministry of Health and Wellness has recognized the increasing cancer burden among the Mauritian population. The MOHW is investing on a state -of-the-art Cancer Hospital with the latest technologies and treatment for optimising cancer care. E-Health is being implemented at the national level. Population at large Have general information about cancer Cancer remains a stigma due to lack of information . Patients and relatives live in fear and suffer in silence. To address this issue, the following actions have already been initiated and will be reinforced: Pamphlets on cancer are available in all health services Regular TV and radio programmes are a tool to promote awareness on cancer NATIONAL CANCER CONTROL PROGRAMME 2022 -2025 22 Stakeholders Role of Stakeh olders Current Status and future actions Prevention Symptoms and signs Early Screening, Treatment De-stigmatization of cancer Awareness campaigns will be reinforced through adequate use of technology for information dissemination, behavioural change and community participation Involvement of the community and participation in cancer prevention and control will be reinforced.

To document the progress achieved. 2. To recognize our weaknesses (clinical and infrastructure). 3. To incorporate the experiences learnt in NCC P 202 2-2025. Achievements The Ministry of Health and Wellness has shown strong commitment to the cancer cause. Increased awareness through sensitization campaign s. HPV vaccination form s part of the National Vaccination Programmes (EPI) since 2016. Regular cervical cancer screening programme is being conducted . Chemotherapy -Introduction of targeted therapy and novel agents in breast cancer, lymphoma, carcinoma lung and Hepatocellular Carcinoma . Decent ralisation of chemotherapy services to all regional hospitals. A dedicated 13 bedded paediatric ward at Victoria Hospital has been set up. Increased in number of Radiot herapy Technologist (RTT) personnel. The first palliative care OPD started in 2017 at Dr A.G. Jeetoo Hospital. Palliative care is being offered as both inpatient and outpatient at Victoria Hospital. Additional Clinical and Radiation Oncologists, Medical Oncologists, Medical Physicists and Radiotherapy Technologists have been recruited. Weaknesses A National Steering Committee was not set up to monitor and evaluate the NCC P 2010 -2014. A structured National Screening Programme has not been set up (cervical, breast and colorectal ). Quality Assurance Programmes were not adopted. Absence of legislation for DNR (Do Not Resuscitate) for palliative care patients. Limited research in the field of oncology. NATIONAL CANCER CONTROL PROGRAMME 2022 -2025 26 Interventions at the level of primary prevention is recognised to be the most effective means of reducing the burden related to cancer. A population -based approach, supported by policy and legislative measures are of great importance in encouraging and sup porting people to adopt a healthy lifestyle, screening for early detection and treatment of cancer, thereby improving the quality of life of cancer patients. Primary prevention Primary prevention measures can prevent up to 40% of all cancer types by reduci ng risk factors, such as smoking, lack of physical activity, overweight and obesity, alcohol consumption, unhealthy diet, excessive sunbathing, and the exposure to carcinogenic substances in working environment as well as by providing immunisation against certain types of viruses and bacteria. Secondary prevention Secondary prevention aims at early detection of cancer through mass screening. Timely detection and treatment of cancer improves overall survival rate. Tertiary prevention Tertiary prevention aims at minimizing consequences related to cancer, by reduction of complications, prevention of dysfunction and providing effective rehabilitation and psycho -social support, so as to improve the quality of life of cancer patients. Cancer awareness Cancer Awareness Programmes are measures taken to sensitise the public of the signs, symptoms, risk factors of cancer so that it is detected at an early stage. Such programmes are carried out through mass media, workshops, and health talks at community level. PRINCIPLES OF CANCER PREVENTION AND CONTROL NATIONAL CANCER CONTROL PROGRAMME 2022 -2025 27 Both primary and secondary prevention are internationally identified as key measures towards reduction of cancer burden. A population -based approach, supported by policy and legislative measures, is of great importance in encouraging and supporting people to adopt a healthy lifestyle. Primary prevention 1. Tobacco 2. Alcohol 3. Obesity, Physical Activity 4. Role of nutrition 5. Environment 6. Infection 7. Sexual education 8. Immunisation Tobacco Tobacco smoke has been classified by International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as a Group 1 carcinogen i.e., the chemical is carcinogenic to humans. More than 7000 chemicals have been identified in tobacco smoke and at least 250 of them, are known to be h armful and more than 50 are known to cause cancer. The Republic of Mauritius is one of the first signatory African country of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) and is in alignment with legislative clauses figuring in the FCTC. Mauritius ratified FCTC on 17/05/2004. A National Action Plan on Tobacco Control 2022-2026 is currently being validated . The 6 MPOWER measures have been listed with specific adaptation to the Mauritian context to monitor tobacco use and prevention policies. 1. Monitor tobacco use and prevention policies. 2. Protect people from tobacco use. 3. Offer help to quit tobacco use. 4. Warn about the dangers of tobacco. 5. Enforce bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship. 6. Raise taxes on tobacco. PREVENTION Recommendations To implement the 6 MPOWER . To reinforce legislation on tobacco use . To be part of all sensitisation campaigns on healthy lifestyle . To p romote \"quit cigarette\" campaigns . NATIONAL CANCER CONTROL PROGRAMME 2022 -2025 28 Alcohol Alcohol remains one of the world's top three priority public health areas as per the World Health Organisation. Globally, alcohol is related to 2.5 million deaths per year and 12.5% of these are due to cancer. Worldwide alcohol is responsible for 5.2% of overall cancer s in males and 1.7% in females . Alcohol consumption is associated with cancer of the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, oesophagus, liver, female breast, and colorectal cancer. Its role in other cancer s, such as lung cancer and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, is inconclusive. There is a dose -response relationship between alcohol and head and neck cancer with 2-to 3-fold increased risk per 50g of alcohol per day, depending on the cancer site. Smoking and alcohol consumption has a synergistic action in head and neck cancer. Figure 3. Alcohol consumption profiles based on gender in Mauritius. A National Action Plan to Reduce the Harmful Use of Alcohol (202 0-2024) has been validated in July 2020. Recommendations To ensure the targeted outcome of the National Action Plan to Reduce the Harmful Use of Alcohol (2020 -2024) are met within the set time frame. To conduct aggressive sensiti sation campaign s against alcohol, use all year round. To include t he harmful use of alcohol consumption in all NCD health promotion and sensiti sation campaigns. NATIONAL CANCER CONTROL PROGRAMME 2022 -2025 29 Physical Inactivity, Dietary factors, Obesity and Overweight As per the Non-Communicable Disease Survey 2015, only 23.7% of Mauritian adults aged 25 -74 years reported undertaking sufficient physical activity. The age and gender standardized prevalence of obesity was 19.1% (11.1% in men and 25.9% in women). (Associate Professor D. Magliano, Associate Professor J. Shaw, Professor P. Zimmet, 2015). Overweight and obesity is accountable for approximately 20% of all cancer cases (Kathleen Y. Wolin, 2010). Based on the rising obesity trends prevalent in the Mauritian context, the Government has enacted various national policies (Ministry of Health and Quality of Life, 2009 -2010): The MOHW has taken the following initiatives: - Establishment of health tracks \"parcours de sant\u00e9\" at a national level. Setting up of health clubs to foster a culture of community sport and physical activity in collaboration with other stakeholders . Further strengthen ing of physical activity programmes (yoga, aerobics, zumba and physical exercise) for women, senior citizens and the population at large by the NCD and Health Promotion Unit of the Ministry. Recommendations Physical activity should be included in the curriculum of the primary, secondary and tertiary institutions. Sensitisation campaigns on the benefit of physical activity for healthy ageing should be reinforced. Sports activities must be encou raged for one and all. More health tracks and outdoor gymnasia to be set up by the Ministry of Health and Wellness. NATIONAL CANCER CONTROL PROGRAMME 2022 -2025 30 Role of Nutrition Unhealthy eating habits may lead to overweight and obesity which are accountable for approximately 20% of all cancer cases (Kathleen Y. Wolin, 2010) and they are known precursors for many chronic illnesses such as hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, depression and anxiety among others. The NCD and Health Promotion Unit of the MOHW carr ies out regular sensitisation campaigns as well as screening program mes for early detection of overweight and obesity at school, community and site of work. More than 50% of all cancer s are related to diet and individual habits like alcoholism and smoking. For example, high fat diet and obesity are associated with breast cancer. Deep -fried, burnt food and preserved (high salt) foods are associated with increase in gastric cancer incidence. Food low in fibre content and rich in animal fat increase s the risk o f cancer of stomach and oesophagus. High intake of red meat and low fibre diet are associated with high incidence of gastric cancer in the USA. WHO has classified processed meat as Group 1 (carcinogenic to humans) while red meat classified as Group 2 A (probably carcinogenic to humans) for colorectal cancer. Carcinogenic food/substances The correlation of unhealthy diet and cancer needs to be emphasised. The population needs to be educated on: adopting a healthy eating habit, by reducing the cons umption of fast foods which are deep fried ; increasing the consumption of fruits and vegetables; different carcinogenic substances in food preparation and how to decrease their consumption (see table below) ; protection of consumers through improved food quality and safety with the mandatory introduction of nutritional sign post labelling so as to get an \"at -a-glance\" information about food being purchased at food venues ; and labelling informing buyers of the levels of sugars, fat, saturated fat and salt. NATIONAL CANCER CONTROL PROGRAMME 2022 -2025 31 Carcinogenic Substances Association with Cancer and measures to reduce the Carcinogenic effects Heterocyclic amines (HCA) Are pyrolysis products synthesizes from food during grilling process Epidemiological studies how associations between intakes of Heterocyclic amines -viewed as potential mutagens - and cancer of the colon, rectum, breast, prostate, pancreas, lung, stomach/oesophagus. Polycyclic Aromatic Hydr ocarbons (PAHs) Avoiding direct exposure of meat to an open flame or a hot metal surface and avoiding prolonged cooking times (especially at high temperatures) can help reduce HCA and PAH formation. (Knize MG,2005). Continuously turning meat over on a hig h heat source can substantially reduce HCA formation compared with just leaving the meat on the heat source without flipping it often (KnizeMG,2005). Removing charred portions of meat and refraining from using gravy made from meat drippings can also reduce HCA and PAH exposure. Aflatoxins Aspergillus molds infest staple crops such as maize, peanuts, rice, and wheat throughout the world. Chronic low -level exposure to aflatoxins, particularly aflatoxin B1, is associated with increased risk of developing live r cancer -hepatocellular carcinoma. To reduce aflatoxin exposure, it is advisable to buy only major commercial brands of nuts and nut butters and by discarding nuts that look mouldy, discoloured, or shrivelled (NCI). Aldehydes Heating up vegetable oils leads to the release of high concentration of chemicals called aldehydes, which have been linked to illnesses including cancer, heart disease and dementia. Low -heat cooking or baking (less than 240 degrees celsius) prevent soils or fats from turning carcinogenic. Instead of deep -frying, pan -frying, and saut\u00e9ing, opt for healthier methods such as baking, boiling, steaming, or broiling. Table 4: Measures to reduce the effects of carcinogenic substances NATIONAL CANCER CONTROL PROGRAMME 2022 -2025 32 Proposed Mauritius Food Standards Authority The Government is coming up with the setting up of a Mauritius Food Standards Authority (MFSA) to act as a body assessing and proposing food standards for adoption. The MFSA will be responsible for: a) revising and updating the national food control policy as needed ; b) advising relevant ministry officials on policy, determination of priorities and use of resources for food control ; c) drafting regulations, standards, and codes of practice and promoting their implementation ; d) coordi nating the monitoring performance of the food control system including laboratory analysis ; and e) developing consumer education and outreach activities and material and promoting their implementation. Environment and cancer Environmental pollution which includes air pollution, water pollution and land pollution all have a bearing on the incidence of cancer. The air is polluted mainly by the emission of toxic fumes from the exhaust pipes of vehicles. The Ministry of Environment, Solid Waste and Climate Change. The Road Traffic Control of Emission (Regulations 2022) came into force on Monday 21 February 2022. The smoke meters will allow the detection of the rate of emission from a diesel engine vehicle and the offenders are liable to a fine accordingly. Water and land get polluted by excessive use of plastics, pesticides, insecticides and herbicides. Though th ere exists a dearth of research in the context of exposure to environmental pollutants and cancer, the most dreaded carcinogenic substance of major environmental importance remains asbestos \"l'amiante\". Asbestos was included as a dangerous chemical in the Dangerous Chemicals Act, 2004. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Service (HHS), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) have established the link existing between asbestos and cancer (Registry, September 2001). Asbestos causes mesothelioma, Recommendations To further sensitise the population on the direct correlation of unhealthy diet/ carcinogenic substances and cancers. To encourage healthy eating habits. To reinforce school health programmes on balanced diet. To adopt the recommendations made by the Mauritius Food Standards Authority. NATIONAL CANCER CONTROL PROGRAMME 2022 -2025 33 a relatively rare cancer of the thin membranes that line the chest and abdomen, as well as cancer of the lung, larynx and ovary. The Ministry of Environment, Solid Waste and Climate Change addresse s issues specific to environmental pollution namely Air Quality, Water Quality, Noise Pollution and Ozone Depleting Substances and Persistent Organic Pollutants. The Ministry also controls Ambient Air Quality regulated under the Environment Protection (Sta ndards for Air) Regulations 1998. Ambient air quality In Mauritius, air pollution control is regulated under the Environment Protection (Standards for Air) Regulations 1998. The Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development has got two ambient air quality monitoring station s: 1. The National Environmental Laboratory at Medco, Cassis. 2. A mobile station circumstantially displaced to sites where high pollution levels are suspected. Automatic analysers and equipment at the stations measure the concentrations of major pollutants such as Sulphur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, carbon monoxide, ozone, particulate lead and respiratory suspended particles (PM10). Climate Change and its impact on Cancer Clima te Change will have adverse impacts on human health. According to various studies, Climate Change such as rising temperatures, wildfires and poor air quality could lead to an increased risk of cancer, especially lung, skin and gastrointestinal cancers. Recommendations A surveillance programme for daily monitoring of pesticide residue levels on a representative sample of fresh fruits and vegetables sold on the local markets to be set up in collaboration with the Ministry of Agro Industry and Food Security. The population at large must be educat ed on the dangers of excessive use of pesticides, insecticides, and herbicides amongst others. Routine checks of government buildings that have used asbestos materials to be carried out. Asbestos is a danger to health when its fibres are released in the a ir. NATIONAL CANCER CONTROL PROGRAMME 2022 -2025 34 Infection and cancer There are many sexually transmitted infections (STD s) that predisposes to certain types of cancer namely, Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) can cause cervical cancer, anus and penis; Chronic Hepatitis Band Hepatitis C infections cause liver cancer; HIV infection can cause several types of cancer including Kaposi Sarcoma. Besides, STD s other infections are also known to cause cancer e.g. Helicobacter Pylori causes cancer of the stomach. Infections and Infestations causing cancer Sexual health education Comprehensive sexual education is a curriculum -based process of teaching and learning about the cognitive, emotional, physical and social aspects of sexuality. In Mauritius sexual education has already been incorporated in the curriculum that are currently used in Standards V and VI since 2011. At the primary level, the learning competencies for sexual education is taught under subjec t \"Health Education\". Sexual education is integrated at the secondary level in subjects like Health & Physical Education, Integrated Science and Biology. Some sexually transmitted infections increase the risk for developing certain cancers. HHV is the primary cause of a number of cancers including those of the cervix, anus and penis. Chronic Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C infections cause liver cancers. HIV patients are susceptible to several cancers including Kaposi Sarcoma . NATIONAL CANCER CONTROL PROGRAMME 2022 -2025 35 Immunisation The Republic of Mauritius has a well -established programme of immunization for boy s and girls as follows : - Immunisation for boys and girls Boys Girls Vaccine Recommended age Vaccine Recommended age BCG 0-3 months BCG 0-3 6 PCV1 6 weeks Hexavalent 1 +OPV1 6 weeks Hexavalent 1 +OPV1 6 weeks Rotavirus Vaccine2 10 weeks Rotavirus Vaccine 2 10 weeks Hexavalent 2 + OPV2 10 weeks Hexavalent 2 +OPV2 10 weeks PCV2 14 weeks PCV2 14 weeks Hexavalent 3 +OPV3 14 weeks Hexavalent 3 +OPV3 14 weeks MMR 9 months MMR 9 months PCV3 10 months PCV3 10 months Booster MMR 17 months Booster MMR 17 months Booster Hexavalent + OPV4 18 months Booster Hexavalent + OPV4 18 months DTaP -IPV (school entry) 5 years DTaP -IPV (school entry) 5 years Tdap 11-12 years HPV vaccine 1 (girls only ) 9 years HPV vaccine 2 (after 6 months) ( girl only ) 9 years Tdap 11-12 years Others Table 5: BCG: Vaccine -IPV: Diphtheria, Tetanus, a cellular pertussis, Inactivated Polio Tdap: Tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis NATIONAL CANCER CONTROL PROGRAMME 2022 -2025 36 Hepatitis B Vaccination Hepatocellular cancers are mostly attributable to hepatitis B virus which can be prevented by vaccination. Hepatitis B vaccination is already included in the EPI. According to the National Expanded Programme of Immunisation, the Hexavalent Vaccine which provides immunity against six important preventable childhood diseases including Hepatitis B is given as a single injection. HPV vaccination in the Republic of Mauritius A National HPV Vaccination Programme has been introduced in 2016 in both public and private schools targeting 9 -year -old girls (5 -school -grade) with a two -dose (0 and 6 months) bival ent HPV vaccine. The vaccine is directed against the two strands of HPV most associated with cervical cancer (16 and 18) and has been included in the Expanded Programme of Immunisation (EPI) in line with WHO recommendations. The vaccine is available for Grade 5 school girls and are administered in two doses with at least six months' interval between the doses. As at date , 88,096 students have been vaccinated. Young boys aged 10 -14 years will also be considered for HPV vaccination . Secondary Prevention Secondary prevention aims at an early diagnosis of cancer through screening activities. In the Mauritian context, screening the general public for detectable preclinical cancer will reduce the overall cancer morbidity and mortality. The multi -ethnic composition of the Mauritian population remains an important component while screening as ethno -cultural sensibilities have to be addressed cautiously. The screening activities conducted by MOHW are mainly directed towards breast and cervical cancer s and are offered in dedicated clinics at Primary Health Care Centres and mobile clinics (Caravane s de Sant\u00e9 ). Recommendations To reinforce sexual education in schools. To conduct sensitisation programmes on prevention, early detection and treatment of Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs). To promote immunization against HPV and Hepatitis B vaccine. To include young boys in the HPV vaccination programme. To consider a one -time catch -up HPV vaccination of 14 -18-year -old girls and document adverse events following HPV vaccination carefully to address vaccine safety. To conduct a high -quality survey to evaluate and confirm reported levels of Hepatitis B vaccine coverage. NATIONAL CANCER CONTROL PROGRAMME 2022 -2025 37 Breast Cancer Screening Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in Mauritius. Breast cancer screening is offered to women attending Primary Health Care Centres and the \"Caravane s de Sant\u00e9\" across the island. Clinical breast examination is carried out by primary health care doctors. Breast self- examination is stro ngly recommended and pamphlets are widely distributed both at community level and at site of work. Mammography services are proposed to high -risk cases. Mammography Mammography has been recognised as the only effective population -based strategy for early detection of breast cancer and mitigates the risk for breast cancer -specific morbidity and mortality. WHO recommends a screening interval of two years as from age 50 -69. In United States, the rate of breast cancer mortality has decreased by more than 30% with the advent of mammography screening. NATIONAL CANCER CONTROL PROGRAMME 2022 -2025 38 Screening Mammography Services Cancer Screening Pathways 1. Patient's age 2. Risk factors for breast cancer 3.

Mass screening by Pap-Test/ Liquid -based Cytology are an established effective method of cervical cancer prevention and is the most successful screening programme. Aims To reduce death from cervical cancer by screening. To provide appropriate ablative excisional treatment for precancerous lesions . Near 60% coverage of target population of sexually active women between the ages of 25 to 65 years for a Pap-Test/ Liquid -based Cytology/Co -testing HPV every 5 years till 2025. Method Liquid Based Cytology (LBC)/Bethesda Protocol. Technical Team of LBC who are trained cytoscreeners (already in place to be scaled up as required) . Dedicated colposcopy unit for management/treatment of pre-cancer on an outpatient basis. Centralised information system for data capture, quality assurance, and call/recall/ follow -up and maintaining of database of target population. HPV/Pap Co-Testing It is a procedure in which a human papillomavirus (HPV) test and a Pap test are done at the same time to check for cervical cancer. The HPV test identifies DNA or RNA of certain high -risk types of HPV in samples of cells taken from the cervix. The Pap test detects cervical cancer cells and abnormal cell changes that may predispose to cervical cancer. The HPV test and the Pap test can be simultaneously carried out on the same cell sample. HPV/Pap co -test is recommended for women aged 25 to 65 years every 5 years. Co -testing has a higher sensitivity for detection of abnormal cells in comparison to only a Pap test. NATIONAL CANCER CONTROL PROGRAMME 2022 -2025 41 Cervical Cancer Screening Pathway Figure 6: Cervical Cancer Screening Pathway Recommendations Co-testing should be introduced in the Cervical Cancer Screening Programme by 2023.

Most of the developed countries have taken measures to control and reduce mortality from Colorectal Cancer. A Pilot S tudy has been carried out by the Ministry of Health a nd Wellness in 2018. The conclusion of this Pilot Study indicate (i) The risk for Colorectal Cancer is 60 -70 years with a male predominance; (ii) Obesity and Overweight (59%) are the prominent risk factors; and (iii) FIT test is the first line screening and is highly specific as well as affordable. It is proposed to screen over a period of five years a round 10 ,000 adul ts aged between 60 and 70 years for the presence of occult blood in stools using the Faecal Immunochemical Test (FIT). Participants having a positive oc cult blood need to undergo colonoscopy for confirmation of the presence of cancer or adenomatous polyps and appropriate treatment will be dispensed.

To establish a well -structured National Screening Programme for breast cancer in Mauritius by 2025 for a specific ag e group (50 -65 years) and for high -risk group. To set up a Breast Health Unit in each regional hospital. A pilot project will first be undertaken at Dr. A.G. Jeetoo Hospital. To restructure the existing Cervical Cancer Screening Programme. Co-testing sho uld be introduced in the Cervical Cancer Screening Programme by 2025. To introduce an efficient colorectal screening programme targeting the age group 55 to 65 years. Set up a central database for the National Cancer Screening Programme. NATIONAL CANCER CONTROL PROGRAMME 2022 -2025 45 Treatment delivery (Surgery, Radiotherapy and Chemotherapy) The Department of Radiotherapy at Victoria hospital was inaugurated by in 1969. Cancer patients have access to Radiotherapy, Chemotherapy, Targeted therapy and Endocrine treatment. Novel agents and Immunotherapy have been recently added to the drug formulary. One of the main modalities of treatment in cancer care remains surgery. All malignant cases are diagnosed and managed by surgeons (general sur geon, neurosurgeon, breast surgeons, ENT surgeons, gynaecologists, orthopaedic surgeons, maxillofacial surgeons) and physicians who are posted across all the five regional hospitals and then referred to the Department of Radiotherapy at Victoria Hospital and National Cancer Hospital for neoadjuvant, concurrent, adjuvant and palliative treatment. The present Radiotherapy services at Victoria Hospital are: - 1. Linear Accelerator (Mevatron) 2. Cobalt -60 machines (Theratron and Equinox) 3. One 2 D simulator with Cone beam CT(Mevasim) 4. One LDR Brach ytherapy (Curietron) The renovated block of the National Cancer Hospital has been operational since October 2020 whereby the chemotherapy services have been shifted to the new centre. Inpatient admissions for both curative and palliative care started since February 2021 (1 male ward 29 bedded and 1 female ward 3 8 bedded). There is a 13 bedded paediatric oncology ward which is under the care of both the paediatrician and the oncologist at Victoria Hospital . Patient care Cancer treatment is becoming more integrated with other disciplines and typically includes any or all of the following in any combination. Surgery Chemotherapy Radiotherapy Paediatric oncology Nuclear Medicine Diagnostic services (radiology and pathology) Allied Medicine: physiotherapy, oncology social work, counselling and psychological support, dietetics, palliative supportive care, emergency care etc. SITUATIONAL ANALYSIS AND CANCER MANAGEMENT NATIONAL CANCER CONTROL PROGRAMME 2022 -2025 46 Diagnosis Radiology Unit The Radiology Unit plays a key role in the multi -disciplinary approach in cancer care and treatment. They provide inputs in d iagnosis, response to treatment and detect recurrence of cancer s among st others. Imaging plays an important role in the management of cancer patients and in screening of asymptomatic individuals for early detection of cancer. The steady and rapid advances in imaging technology in the last few decades have changed cancer management. X -Ray, Ultrasonography, CT -Scan, MRI as well as , to a limited extent , interventional radiology are available for all cancer patients. Interventional Radiology Interventional Radiology (IR) is a subspecialty of radiology which deals with diagnosis and treatment, using minimally invasive procedures done under image guidance like ultrasound, Computer Tomography (CT Scan) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) ., chemical ablation, radio frequency ablation, trans arterial chemo embolization, portal vein embolization can also be used as a treatment strategy by interventional technologists . There is a need to recruit experienced interventional radiologist s. Laboratory Services involved in cancer care Cancer -related laboratory services are provided by the Central Health Laboratory (CHL) situated at Victoria Hospital. Basic lab oratory investigations are being carried out at the renovated building of the National Cancer Hospital . In the near future, at the National Cancer Hospital , the services are expected to further expand to cater for all oncology cases and to introduce more sophisticated tests. Histopathology and Cytology The CHL ha s a well -developed histopathology and cytology department with trained laboratory technician s and pathologists. Training of pathologists and introduction of the Immunohistochemistry Unit for confirmation of the type of malignancies need to be catered for . Biochemistry The Biochemistry Department of the CHL carr ies out assays of a selected list of tumour markers. Additional investigations will be soon introduced in the National Cancer Hospital . NATIONAL CANCER CONTROL PROGRAMME 2022 -2025 47 Haematology Haematology services of CHL play a central role in the investigation of leukemias, bleeding disorders and ot her haematological malignancies . Classification of leukemias by Flow Cytometry will be introduced shortly at the National Cancer Hospital . Microbiology The Microbiology and Virology Department identif ies many types of viral, bacterial and other microbial infections through serological and other immunological investigations. These types of infections require reliable laborator y-based diagnosis for appropriate management. Transfusion support in cancer management Transfusion support is an essential component in cancer care and treatment, as many cancer patients particularly in haematological malignancies require transfusion of whole blood or blood components at regular intervals. The National Blood Transfusion Services (NBTS) provide this support by making available a whole range of blood products to cancer patients. The NBTS collects blood from voluntary non-remunerated blood donors. Intensification of therapeutic regimens, improved patient survival, and advances in cytokine and cellular therapies have led to increasingly complex requirements for transfusion and stem cell support in cancer treatment. Improving transfusion support to cancer patient s 1. To strengthen apheresis program me and capacity building to provide blood components in a timely manner through: a. developing strategies for increasing apheresis donor pool; b. reinforcing capacity to perform apheresis through purchase of additional equipment. 2. To support transplantation programme by collecting and banking stem cells and training of staff in stem cell collection. Nuclear medicine Nuclear Medicine uses radioactive substances for the diagnosis and treatment of certain types of cancer. The only Nuclear Medicine facility was set up in May 2001 at Jawaharlal Nehru Hospital in collaboration with International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Nuclear Medicine also assesses th e extent of cancer disease and evaluates treatment response. All Physicians, Physicist s, Radio pharmacist s and Technologists have received training in nuclear medicine, sponsored by the IAEA in reputed cancer centres abroad. NATIONAL CANCER CONTROL PROGRAMME 2022 -2025 48 Patients suffering from breas t and prostate cancer are routinely referred for follow up of bone metastasis by means of scintigraphy. Early diagnosis of bone metastasis ensures timely treatment thereby improving quality of life of these patients. A PET-CT (Positron Emission Tomography hybrid imaging modalities which gives physiological as well as detailed morphological information of tumors, lesions and other diseases. In Oncology, the indications of PET CT Scan are mostly for diagnosis of malignancy, staging, tumour characterization, response assessment, re -staging and surveillance. A PET CT Scan will be procured and installed at the National Cancer Hospital . Recommendations To recruit experienced interventional radiologists. To further expand the services of the National Cancer Hospital to cater for all oncology cases in the future. To introduce more sophisticated tests and additional investigations. Training of pathologists and introduction of the Immunohistochemistry Unit for confirmation of the type of malignancies in patients. To further classify leukemias by Flow Cytometry. To support transplantation programme by collecting and banking stem. Procu rement and installation of a PET CT Scan at the National Cancer Hospital . To strengthen apheresis programme, capacity building and to provide blood components in a timely manner through: (i) developing strategies for increasing apheresis donor pool (ii) reinforcing capacity to perform apheresis through purchase of additional equipment. NATIONAL CANCER CONTROL PROGRAMME 2022 -2025 49 Surgery In Mauritius, cancer patients requiring surgery are performed by general surgeons, neurosurgeon s, ENT surgeon s, maxillo facial surgeons, gynaecologist s and orthopaedic surgeons. According to the EUROCARE -IV study , the absence of guidelines for surgical procedures relating to cancer patients lowers the 5 -year survival by approximately 15% . Therefore, there is a need to set up guidelines for surgical procedures and train surgeons and gynaecologists in oncology to achieve better outcomes. A super specialized department of surgical oncology must be created so as to adopt a multidisciplinary team approach in the management of cancer cases. Radiotherapy Radiation therapy is available only at Victoria Hospital . Radiation therapy accounts for approximately 60% of the treatment modality for cancer patients and is potentially curative in cervical cancer, prostate, anal canal and early lung cancer among st others. It improves cancer survival when used as an adjuvant treatment in cancer such as breast cancer, brain tumour and colorectal carcinoma. Radiotherapy also plays a very important ro le in palliation of pain, haemorrhage, superior venacava obstruction, spinal cord compression, and raised intra cranial pressure and thus improves the quality of life of cancer patients. Conventional Radiotherapy is still being used to treat patients in th e department. 3D Conformal Radiotherapy, Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy, Stereotactic Radiotherapy is now the international standard of care. Two new Linear Accelerators with multi -leaf collimators will soon be procured and installed at the National Cancer Hospital . Training will be provided to Radiation Oncologists, Medical Physicists and Radiotherapy Technologists by IAEA under the Project TC/MAR/6015. Patients will then benefit from modern sophisticated techniques.

Every semester, Photon dosimetry is carried out as per TRS398 using Farmer Chamber, Roos Chamber and electrometer. Dose measurement using Linac check Detector is also carried out. Radiation Protection/Radiation Safety Radiotherapy has benefited beyond doubt many patients over the years, few accidents have occurred worldwide during its administration leading to disastro us consequences. More importantly, many incidents with lesser clinical impact can occur daily, putting at risk the safety of patients. Radiation safety is an essential component of radiation care. It has been proved that whenever safe procedures have been ensured during the delivery of radiotherapy, not only lesser incidents/near misses have occurred, but also better treatment quality has been observed. To ensure radiation safety in a Radiotherapy Unit, the following measures should be reinforced: 1. Effective trained and active regulatory authority. 2. Adequate infrastructure and facility. 3. Adequate number of trained staff. 4. Appropriate treatment equipment for the disease specific sites. 5. Support equipment for QA and optimization. 6. Commitment to safety (safety systems and culture) 7. Appointment of Radiation Protection Officer Recommendation It is highly advisable to appoint a Radiation Protection Officer to ensure the safe practices and procedures in relation to Radiotherapy. QUALITY ASSURANCE IN RADIOTHERAPY NATIONAL CANCER CONTROL PROGRAMME 2022 -2025 53 Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is one of the main modalities of treatment in cancer care. Other pharmacological treatment used in cancer care is hormonal, biological or a combination of all of them. In the public health sector, treatment is available free of charge . The hospital drug list formulary is constantly reviewed and updated for novel therapy. Patients benefit from immunotherapy for various cancers. Pharmacy services There is a well -structured Pharmacy services at the level of the MOHW for procurement and managing the supply chain of drugs, from the central store, to all the health points for dispensing to users. The hospital drug formulary consists of 65 drugs used for cancer patients. However, for any patient requiring a non-listed drug, a therapeutic board is held at the hospital level, for its approval. Recommendations 1.The range of drugs used for Chemotherapy and Immunotherapy must be extended to include all drugs approved by WHO. 2.Novel therapy needs to be added in our existing drug formulary. 3.A continuous supply of chemotherapeutic agents should be ensured. 4.The Pharmacy Board should be regularly h eld at a 3 -months interval. NATIONAL CANCER CONTROL PROGRAMME 2022 -2025 54 Introduction Palliative Care is an approach which improves the quality of life of patients and families facing the problem of life-threatening illness es through the prevention and relief of suffering by means of early identification and impeccable assessment and treat ment of pain and other problems, physical, psycho -social and spiritual (WHO 2002). About five million people in the world die of cancer each year without having benefitted from palliative care . In 2020, 1431 cancer -related deaths occurr ed in Mauritius and most of them benefitted from palliative care. Road Map to Palliative Care in Mauritius The roadmap to Palliative Care in Mauritius was drawn by a team of Oncologists with the help of WHO. Palliative care services for cancer patients were started in 2017 at Victoria Hospital with one out- patient clinic and two in -patient wards ; one female and one male. The out -patient clinics are conducted by a multidisciplinary team comprising the following: - Patient and family Oncolog ist Palliative Care Physician Nurses (male and female) Nutritionist Psychologist Medical Social Worker Health Care Assistant The same team also provide s this service in four regional hospitals namely: Victoria Hospital, Dr A.G. Jeetoo, Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam National Hospital and Jawaharlal Nehru Hospital. In 2017, funding for a \"Training for Trainers\" course in Palliative Care was sponsored under the WHO Biennium work plan. This course was jointly provided by the University of Cape Town, St Luke's Hospice, and the Hospice and Palliative Care Association of South Africa. One Oncologist, four (4) nurses from Mauritius, one (1) nurse from Rodrigues and one (1) medical social worker were sent for the training. Drugs for Palliative Care Patient The list of drugs for palliative care in cancer patients includes sustained and immediate release morphine, fentanyl patches, tramadol and others listed in the International Association for Hospice and Palliative Care list of essent ial medicines. The way forward Palliative Care now forms an integral part of the services offered to cancer patients through the, National Cancer Hospital and its outstation units . PALLIATIVE CARE NATIONAL CANCER CONTROL PROGRAMME 2022 -2025 55 However, the Palliative Care Services for cancer patients will need to be expanded over the coming four years. The services will further be developed at the following levels: i. Hospital inpatient ii. Community iii. Domiciliary However, without the provision of adequate training to all Palliative Care Team members, the expansion of the services will remain restricted. Hospital based palliative care for cancer patient Hospital based palliative care will mainly refer to specialist palliative care. It will consist of the following : - Inpatient palliative care facilities Outpatient palliative care. Short term goals 2022 Mid-term goals 2023 -2024 Long term goals 2025 To strengthen the existing inpatient and outpatient palliative care services through further training of the health care personnel.

NATIONAL CANCER CONTROL PROGRAMME 2022 -2025 58 In Mauritius, paediatric malignanc ies account for around 0.55 % of all new cancer cases registered in 2020 . The incidence of childhood malignancies, across the world is much less compared to adult malignancies. The survival rates (5 years survival) are significantly higher in high -income count ries reaching an average of 84% and are steadily improving due to research and modern technologies. However, the incidence of childhood cancer is on the rise as per the International Association of Cancer Registries (IARC). The paediatric cancer patients are taken care jointly by the Paediatric ian and Oncologist. There is a dedicated 13 bedded paediatric oncology ward at Victoria Hospital. Recommendations To train /recruit paediatric Oncologists. To introduce High dose chemotherapy and bone marrow trans plant unit . To twin w ith a centre of excellence in paediatric oncology. PAEDIATRIC ONCOLOGY NATIONAL CANCER CONTROL PROGRAMME 2022 -2025 59 Breast Cancer Breast cancer is the most common cancer in the female population and accounts for about 20% of the total number of cancer cases registered in Mauritius .

A hospital -based study in Mauritius showed that more than half of cases present with pT2 (2 -5cm) breast lesion. A large majority of patients still present with locally advance d/ Metastatic Breast Cancer , as compared to that of developed countries. Patients with early stage (0, I, at the most stage II) disease have a better overall survival. Primary and secondary prevention are of utmost importance for better control and survival. A well -established, efficient and well -structured screening programme for breast cancer will considerably decrease the morbidity and mortality. Early and appropriate treatment, will lead to an improvement in the overall survival of breast cancer patients. Breast Cancer Screening There is an urgent need to set up an organized mammography screening programme f or breast cancer for women aged 50 to 69 years. The implementation will require trained radiologists and technicians in mammography services. This screening programme will t arget at least 50% of women aged 50-69 by 2025 and high risk cases. Main Objective To expand access to breast can cer prevention, early detection, timely treatment and care to reduce mortality significantly by 40% by 2025. Specific Objectives To ensure that a healthy lifestyle is adopted by the general population which can significantly reduce the incidence of breast cancer. To establish a National Screening Programme in Mauritius for a specified age group (50 -69 years) and for high -risk group s. To increase awareness of breast cancer in the general population by 60% by 2025. To introduce genetic counselling and genetic testing targeting the high -risk group initially. Key Strategies To establish Breast Health Units (BHU) in each regional Hospital. To increase coverage of mammography services by 50% in Mauritius. To educate the health professionals of all cadres about signs, symptoms, clinical examination and importance of early diagnosis and improve referral system (fast track the referral system for women with stage 0 or abnormal results needing further management ). To implement a National Screening Programme on breast cancer. To introduce genetic testing and counselling. NATIONAL CANCER CONTROL PROGRAMME 2022 -2025 61 Breast Health Unit A multi -disciplinary Breast Health Unit needs to be set up. This unit will provide a personalized service to patients with breast lumps . \"One stop shop\" breast clinic where clinical examination, investigations (ultrasound, contrast enhanced high resolution MRI) and biopsies will be performed on a fast -track basis. It is to be noted that around 50 cases of hereditary BCs (10% of breas t cancer are hereditary) are diagnosed in Mauritius every year. Hence the importance of contrast enhanced high resolution MRI. Genetic counselling and genetic testing (BRCA1/ BRCA2) will be offered. Breast conserving surgery/modified radical mastectomy and breast reconstruction for suitable/eligible patients will be made available. Psychological support and lymphedema care among others will be provided. \"High risk\" breast cancer screening and counselling will be carried out . Composition of the Breast Health Unit Radiologist Surgeon Anaesthetist Pathologist Visiting oncologist Visiting Psychologist Female Nurses Female Health Care Assistant Attendant The facilities provided should include: - Breast Cancer screening (Mammography and Ultrasound) and counselling. Ultrasound guided trucut biopsy and fine needle aspiration cytology. Early referral for surgery breast conserving surgery/modified radical mastectomy, breast reconstruction and sentinel lymph node bio psy. Advantages Patients will be treated according to international guidelines/standards in a timely manner. Patients will be able to benefit from breast conserving surgery instead of routinely performed mastectomy. Accurate preoperative diagnosis reduces the need for unnecessary surgical procedures/ biopsies. Prompt discharge from hospital leading to cost -effective use of available resources (Evidence based management). NATIONAL CANCER CONTROL PROGRAMME 2022 -2025 62 Recommendations Setting up of Breast Health Units (BHU) in each regional Hospital. A Pilot Project in Dr. A.G. Jeetoo Hospital to be set up.

This will build our understanding of cancer , develop new therapeutic and diagnostic designs of new treatment and prevention strategies. Adequate research on the causes and cure of cancer can save live s and to develop safe and effective methods for its prevent ion, detect ion, diagnos is, treat ment and cure. Research will help the medical cadres gain extensive knowledge about the biological processes involved in cancer onset, growth, and spread in the human body. This will lead to the development of effective and targeted treatments and prevention strategies. In this respect, it is recommended to partner and collaborate with international centres or researche rs who may contribute their know -how for the setting up of a Research Unit at the National Cancer Hospital . Advances on research are the result of constantly building on earlier discoveries and observations in order to come up with ideas and solutions combining today's evolving technology proposing a better treatment outcome for the future. RESEARCH NATIONAL CANCER CONTROL PROGRAMME 2022 -2025 87 Quality control in implementation of National Cancer Control Programme An important component of the NCC P is to have a strong leadership which will ensure that the main pillars of cancer control and cancer prevention are evaluated and monitored so that the NCC P's goals can be achieved. NCCP Steering Committee A Steering Committee will be set up under the chair of the Director General Health Services to oversee the implem entation of cancer control activities . It will comprise Officers from the Ministry of Health and Wellness, representatives of other key ministries and Non -Government Organisations . Sub-Committees on Cancer Awareness (Health Education), National Cancer Scre ening Programme, Diagnostics and T reatment, Palliative Care and Research will be also set up. The Committee will be held every 3 months to supervise and evaluate the fulfilment of the key strategies and specific objectives of the programme. Deviations from the set objectives of the programme will be identified in the quarterly meeting s and measures will be taken to improve the necessary activities so as to reach the objectives. The management, implementation, evaluation and the analysis o f NCC P 2022 -2025 indicator s falls under the NCC P Steering Committee . Objectives of the Committee To provide professional management and coordinate the implementation of the Programme. To carry out an annual draft report on the achievements of the Programme . To act as a facilitator in the adoption of NCC P. PLANNING CANCER CONTROL PROGRAMME NATIONAL CANCER CONTROL PROGRAMME 2022 -2025 88 Healthcare Financing for Cancer Services 1.1 The development of a National Cancer Cont rol Programme ( NCC P) for the period 202 2-2025 conforms to Government's policy in the health sector, which aims at achieving the highest standards of good health among people. A prerequisite for the successful implementa tion of the plan will be the earmarking of sufficient public financial resources to expand access to needed health technologies, acquire the necessary manpower and build skills in order to develop a comprehensive range of affordable and effective services for cancer patients in Mauritius. 1.2 Health financing consists of the mobilization, accumulation and allocation of money to cover the health needs of the population, individually and collectively. In practice, financing a complex set of services such as those in cancer control requires consi derable analysis and contextualization if the objectives of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) are to be met. Consideration such as allocation of funds for cancer within the overall UHC envelope , benefits from the allocation, beneficiaries targeted , are generally addressed in an investment case. 1.3 The Government of Mauritius is fully aware that cancer patients have a better overall survival when they have access to affordable early cancer detection and treatment. As per Budget 2021 -2022, the estima ted project value of the National Cancer Hospital (NCH ) with a total surface area of approximately 14,630 square metres at Solferino, for the provision of state -of-the art facilities to these patients, is around Rs 1.6 billion . The main objectives of improving funding for cancer control are to promote UHC through equitable and greater financial risk protection, reduce out -of-pocket payments for expensive cancer treatments and improve access to high -quality cancer services in the country. Costing Metho dology 2.1 Key stakeholders were interviewed and information has been provided by the user departments on the human resources and training requirements, equipment specificities and activities/ interventions to be undertaken. 2.2 The costing of the human resources has been based on the range of salaries of the different cadres as stipulated in the Pay Research Bureau Report 2021. The estimated cost of equipment has been benchmarked from the prevailing market prices. The costing has been done for the remain ing four years of the Plan that is 2022 to 2025 . The CHL participated in the provision of estimated costs for the laboratory related services. The Nuclear Medicine Department of the Jawaharlal Nehru Hospital provided the necessary information on the provis ion of new Nuclear Medicine Services at NCH . The NCD, Health Promotion and Research Unit came up with an estimated costs for Cervical Cancer Screening. FINANCING OF NATIONAL CANCER CONTROL PROGRAMME 2022 - 2025 NATIONAL CANCER CONTROL PROGRAMME 2022 -2025 89 Main Costs Elements of NCCP 3.1 The major startup costs for strengthening cancer services in Mauritius as determined by the user department include investment in infrastructure, human resources and equipment. Funds for the procurement of major equipment for the NCH have already been earmarked by Government. 3.2 Costs of human resources for the initial oper ations and services at the NCH have been earmarked in the current budget. No additional costs will be incurred for staff that has been redeployed. Over the coming years, as and when new specialized services will be introduced, new posts will be created for required specialized staff and the availability of additional funds will be ensured through the annual recurrent budget. 6.
