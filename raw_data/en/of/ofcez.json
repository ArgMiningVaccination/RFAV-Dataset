The service has now been extended to December 2024. The CanTEST Health and Drug Checking Service is operated by [Directions Health Services](https://directionshealth.com/cantest) in partnership with [Pill Testing Australia](https://pilltestingaustralia.com.au) and Canberra Alliance for Harm Minimisation and Advocacy. This is a free service. Drug checking is a harm reduction service (also known as pill testing) that analyses the contents of drugs to help service users better understand the unknown and potentially dangerous substances in illicit drugs. Appropriate information, counselling and advice are provided to service users based on their specific test result, to encourage choices that reduce overall drug use and the harms associated with taking illicit drugs. ACT Health has also developed [The Festivals Pill Testing Policy](https://www.health.act.gov.au/sites/default/files/2020-09/The%20Festivals%20Pill%20Testing%20Policy_September%202020.pdf), which provides guidance to event planners regarding harm minimisation at large events such as music festivals.

The second Australian trial of a drug checking service was conducted by Pill Testing Australia at the Canberra Groovin the Moo festival in April 2019 as one element of a broader harm reduction approach. This followed the first drug checking trial at the same festival in 2018. The 2019 trial was independently evaluated by the Australian National University - research that is a first of its kind in Australia.
