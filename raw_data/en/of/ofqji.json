The standard first-line treatment for PDAC is gemcitabine chemotherapy which, unfortunately, offers only limited chance of a lasting cure. This review further evaluates the hypothesis that the effectiveness of gemcitabine can be improved by combining it with evidence-based complementary measures. Previously, supported by clinical trial data, we suggested that a number of dietary factors and nutraceuticals can be integrated with gemcitabine therapy. Here, we evaluate a further 10 agents for which no clinical trials have (yet) been carried out but there are promising data from in vivo and/or in vitro studies including experiments involving combined treatments with gemcitabine. Two groups of complementary agents are considered: Dietary and emodin). i n addition, we identified seven promising agents for which there is currently only basic (mostly in vitro) data. Finally, as a special case of combination therapy, we highlighted synergistic drug combinations involving gemcitabine with \"repurposed\" aspirin or metformin. we conclude overall that integrated management of PDAC currently is likely to produce the best outcome for patients and for this a wide range of complementary measures is Thymoquinone 1. Introduction Pancreatic form of which is \"pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma\" (PDAC), is one of the hardest to treat cancers both because of the diffi- culty of early diagnosis and the limited effectiveness of the available therapies (1-3). With a five-year sur - vival rate of only some 6%, the associated mortality rates are regional (deaths per 100,000 people) being ca. 7.2 (Europe), 6.5 (North America) and 1.2 (East Africa) (4 ). PDAC is age-related; its incidence has been rising steeply for a number of years, and it is expected to become the most common cause of cancer-related deaths in the USA by 2030 (5 ). PDAC arises in the pancreatic ducts which perform the gland's main exo- crine functions. The liver is often the first major organ to be metastasized due to the proximity of the hepatic portal vein (6 ). In fact, liver failure is frequently the first sign and the main cause of death from PDAC. In the context of integrated management, therefore, treat- ments should ideally protect also the liver. The most common first-line treatment for PDAC is gemcitabine chemotherapy (7 , 8). Gemcitabine is an \"antimetabolite\" pro-drug which becomes active once phosphorylated into diphosphate or triphosphate inside cells at very specific phases of the mitotic cycle. Thus, it works most effectively on fast-dividing cells, hence cancer cells. The basic mechanism of cell death is DNA damage ( 9). Apart from its inherent limited effectiveness and the common undesirable side effects of the treat- ment, use of gemcitabine suffers from the eventual onset of resistance to the drug. In these respects, there- fore, any adjustment to gemcitabine chemotherapy that 2021 the a uthor(s).

B. A. DJAMGOZ AND v. JeNTZSCH will increase its sensitivity (and hence lower its dosage of use) and lengthen its period of effectiveness (e.g., overcoming resistance) would be welcome. Our hypoth- esis is that these are possible by combining the gem- citabine chemotherapy with evidence-based complementary agents. Indeed, use of complementary agents in cancer treatment generally is increasingly, being favored by patients as well as by oncologists (10-14). In the first instance, an association between dietary/nutritional lifestyle and PDAC is apparent epidemiologically from the fact that the PDAC inci- dence and mortality rates are much higher in rela- tively developed countries with diets rich in fatty, oily or sweet foods (4 ). Whilst our understanding of this association has come a long way over the years, we know much less about how dietary and nutraceutical agents, as well as lifestyle factors, could associate with PDAC during treatment (15). In our previous review, we advanced the hypothesis that the best outcome for PDAC currently would be obtained by integration of clinical medicine with evidence-based natural complementary agents and lifestyle factors (16). Of the former, 9 (six dietary and three nutra- ceutical compounds) were chosen based upon evi- dence from clinical trials as the essential criterion, as well as meta-analyses and in vivo and in vitro experiments. In addition, however, there is a range of natural agents that did not meet all of those strict criteria but may do so in the future as more evidence is gathered. Here, we evaluate this second group of \"emerging\" agents incorporating both dietary factors and nutraceuticals. For all these, there is both in vivo and/or in vitro evidence including combination treatments. in vivo animal models include molecu- larly appropriate transgenic models wherever possi- ble. As regards in vitro experiments, the data used come mainly from human cells. Central to our approach, again, is the epigenetic nature of cancer, including PDAC, which means that genes and their products can be regulated signifi- cantly including by dietary and lifestyle factors (16- 20). Indeed, overall, ca. 40% of cancers are due to modifiable, hence reversible factors (www.cancer.org/ latest-news/more-than-4-in-10-cancers-and-cancer- deaths-linked-to-modifiable-risk-factors.html). Not surprisingly, therefore, the link between nutrition and cancer has been questioned for over a century (21). Since pancreas is a strongly hormonal (both endo- crine and exocrine) organ, PDAC would be expected to be particularly sensitive to the body's biochemistry and chemical balance (e.g., Refs. (22-25)).2. Dietary Factors In our previous review we considered dietary factors in 3 different categories (16). General/background con- ditioners included acidity, glycaemic index and choles- terol. As multifactorial foodstuffs, we covered red and processed meat, fish, fruit and vegetables, dairy, honey and coffee. Finally, as specific dietary agents the fol- lowing satisfied our full criteria: Vitamins A, C, D, and E, curcumin and genistein. Here, we have accepted for further consideration six specific dietary factors for which significant in vivo and in vitro data were avail- able. The emphasis again is on the possible potentiating effect of these agents on gemcitabine chemotherapy. Such dietary agents can also be taken as supplements. 2.1. Resveratrol Resveratrol is a natural phytoalexin that is produced in plants as a defensive response against fungal infec- tions and other environmental stressors. It is particu- larly abundant in the skin of red grapes, blueberries, raspberries, mulberries and nuts (Table 1A). Resveratrol has been shown to inhibit proliferation and invasiveness of PDAC cells by reducing \"nuclear factor -light-chain-enhancer of activated B (25-27). Furthermore, markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), an early event in invasiveness, were suppressed (28). A synthetic, more stable derivative of resveratrol (tri- acetyl resveratrol) also selectively induced apoptosis in PDAC cells in vitro without affecting normal pancreatic ductal cells and this occurred via downregulation of hedgehog signaling (29). Combined treatment of PDAC cells with gemcitabine and resveratrol (i) increased apoptosis highly significantly and (ii) reduced gemcit- abine resistance in vitro and this involved adenosine monophosphate kinase (AMPK) (30, 31). Also, in vitro, the inhibition of colony formation by gemcitabine was enhanced by resveratrol addition, again, involving an enhanced pro-apoptotic effect (Figure 1A ) (27). Consistent with this, in an in vivo orthotopic mouse model of PDAC, the anti-tumorigenic effect with resvera- trol ( Figure 1B) (32). These results were confirmed by Gupta et al. and Xu, Q. et al . (33, 34). Importantly, also, resveratrol suppressed both the \"basal\" stemness of PDAC cells and that promoted by gemcitabine (Figure 1C) (27). In addition, pterostilbene, a natural analogue derived from resveratrol, enhanced gemcit- abine sensitivity in part by inhibiting expression of the multi-drug resistance gene, MDR1 (35).NUTRiTiON AND CANCeR 1141 Interestingly, addition of resveratrol to the com- bined application of gemcitabine and capsaicin restored the effectiveness of chemotherapy and increased radio- sensitivity in in vivo (xenograft) models of human PDAC ( 36, 37). These studies would raise the possi- bility of extending the integrated management to triple (or more) combinations without incurring antagonism, as we suggested earlier (16). Finally, resveratrol reduced the undesirable side effects of chemotherapy on heart and liver by increasing the activity of anti- oxidant enzymes (38). In conclusion, resveratrol has excellent properties both by itself as an anti-PDAC agent and for possible integration with gemcitabine chemotherapy in the future. 2.2. Epigallocatechin Gallate Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is abundant in teas, especially green tea, and fruits, especially berries (Table 1A). Epidemiological studies have shown ben- eficial effects of green tea on cancers of lung, breast, esophageal, stomach, liver and prostate (39, 40). As regards PDAC, however, such studies have given somewhat inconsistent results. Most meta-analyses concluded (i) that green tea consumption was not associated with PDAC risk and (ii) that high con- sumption was associated with slightly lower risk (41). This seemed more pronounced among Chinese pop- ulations (42, 43). Abe et al. recently evaluated the available epidemiological evidence for green tea con- sumption and showed that whilst PDAC risk was not affected, several other cancers were associated signifi- cantly with reduced risk (44). These included, impor - tantly, liver cancer. Possible reasons for the discrepancy between the epidemiological data could include (i) the ranges of green tea consumption and (ii) com- pounding lifestyle factors especially smoking. Importantly, however, no adverse effect has been reported. Furthermore, green tea consumption could be beneficial indirectly by reducing the impact of diabetes, obesity and inflammation including pancre- atitis ( 40, 45-47). There is a wealth of in vitro evidence showing that green tea and one of its most active ingredients, EGCG, inhibit development and progression of cancer, includ- ing PDAC (48, 49). As regards \"combination therapies, \" an initial in vitro study suggested significant synergistic effects of gemcitabine with EGCG (over a range of concentrations). This involved increased expression of \"signal transducer and activator of transcription 3\" (STAT3) target genes and enhanced apoptosis (Figure 2A) (50). More recently, EGCG was able to enhance the gemcitabine-induced reduction in insulin-like Figure 1. e ffects of a dietary compound on Pda C: r esveratrol.

In conclusion, the evidence for EGCG as an anti-PDAC agent is overall positive, albeit limited. The evidence is stronger for liver cancer. Hence, this agent would be worth considering for possible inte- gration with gemcitabine chemotherapy in the future. 2.3. Vitamin B9 Vitamin B9 (folate) is one of eight B vitamins. It is abundant in foods such as citrus fruits, green leafy veg- etables and legumes (Table 1A) (53). Taken as folic acid, it is converted to folate by the body. Folate deficiency has been shown to induce chromosomal breaks and mutations in tumor suppressor genes, hence its supple- mentation proved beneficial against PDAC (54). The level of reduced risk from increased folate intake varied between studies, but importantly, no adverse effect has been reported (53, 55). Lin, H. et al. found in a meta-analysis that a high intake of folate, especially as part of diet, reduced the relative risk of PDAC by as much as 34% (Figure 3) (53). This conclusion was sup- ported by Y allew et al. , also reporting a significant inverse association between folate intake and PDAC (56). Studies have suggested that folate supplementation may be most beneficial when taken with certain folate-rich foods, e.g., spinach and asparagus (56). Although vitamin B9 has not been tested in combination with gemcitabine systemically, it is one of the four com- ponents of the FOLFIRINOX regime, which is given to cases advanced (metastatic) PDAC. So, it can be con- sidered acceptable for integrated management of PDAC. In conclusion, we consider vitamin B9 to be an effective complement to gemcitabine chemotherapy of PDAC. We should note, however, that B vitamins are sometimes taken as a \"complex\" of the various forms, but this should best be avoided, since there is some evidence that B12 may promote cancer including PDAC ( 57). The latter is consistent with dietary sources of B12 (animal products such as meat, dairy etc.) also being undesirable (16). 2.4. Capsaicin Capsaicin is the active ingredient of hot red peppers (Table 1A) (58). It has anticancer properties through its ability to induce cell cycle arrest and cause apop- tosis (58). Capsaicin reduced the growth of PDAC xenografts in mice by promoting apoptosis mediated (59). Additionally, capsa- icin downregulated PI3 kinase signaling, leading to an increase in cell cycle arrest. Through the inhibition of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, capsa- icin could generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increase DNA damage, without affecting healthy pan- creatic cells (60). There is no study on the possible effects of combining capsaicin with gemcitabine. However, in cases where gemcitabine monotherapy Table 1. d ietary and nutraceutical agents with emerging anti-Pda C effects. a. dietary agent Formula Mechanisms of action/Cellular effects Food sources resveratrol C14H12o3 Multiple - anti-inflammatory; antioxidant; inhibition of growth and stemnessred grapes (especially the skin), blueberries, raspberries, nuts eGCG C22H18o11 Multiple - anti-inflammatory; antioxidant; anti-angiogenic; pro-apoptotic; effects B9 oxidative stress immune responseVegetables, (especially green whole grains, eggs, legumes, cherries, red raspberry, onions B.

This effect occurred through apoptosis. If, however, gemcitabine was at its full effectiveness, no increase following treatment with resveratrol and capsaicin was observed. Combinations of resveratrol and capsaicin were also able to sensitize some PDAC cell lines to radiotherapy, leading to fur - ther reduction in tumor volume in vivo (Figure 4B) (36). Capsaicin may also benefit patients through pain relief and reduction of inflammation (61). In conclusion, capsaicin has excellent properties for possible integration into management of PDAC, both directly and as regards side effects of the treatment. 2.5.

Although by itself it is not readily bioavailable, its various metabolites (present in sys- temic circulation after consumption) demonstrate sig- nificant biological (antioxidant and anti-inflammatory) activity. In vitro, quercetin suppressed a range of PDAC cell behaviors by regulating a variety of sig- naling pathways. Cell viability was suppressed dose-dependently (Figure 5A) (62, 64). Apoptotic cell death was increased significantly (Figure 5B) (e. g., Ref. (63)). The pro-apoptotic/anti-tumor effect of quercetin was confirmed in frozen tissue sections of human PDAC xenografts and shown to involve miR-let-7c as an intermediary (65). Importantly, also, in human primary PDAC cells, quercetin upregulated miR-200b-3p expression and inhibited Notch signal- ing, resulting in inhibition of stemness and self-renewal (66). Parallel to these effects, quercetin strongly down- regulated the expression of a range of EMT markers (Figure 5C ) (28, 64). Consistent with these effects, taken together, cellular invasiveness was significantly decreased, and this was dose dependent (Figure 5D) (64). There is also some evidence from human PDAC cells in vitro that quercetin potentiates the effective- ness of gemcitabine in inhibiting cell viability and promoting apoptosis (Figures 5A and B). Also, on two human PDAC cell lines, Serri et al. used biode- gradable nanoparticles and showed, again, that quer - cetin could enhance the impact of gemcitabine on cell viability by 15-20% (67). Consistent with these results, Lan et al. showed that quercetin had a remark- able pro-apoptotic effect on a gemcitabine-resistant variant of Mia-Paca-2 cells (Figure 5E) (62). This was extended recently to several other gemcitabine-resistant PDAC as well as hepatocarcinoma cell lines by Liu ZJ et al. ( 68). This effect was revealed to involve the \"receptor for advanced glycation end products\" (RAGE) (62). In a further study, a natural isoform of quercetin, quercetin-3-O-glucoside, exhibited synergy with low concentrations of gemcitabine on human PDAC CFPAC-1 and SNU-213 cells in suppressing transverse migration induced by basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) (69). In vivo, also, quercetin caused a significant reduc- tion of tumor volume in a xenograft model of PDAC, again involving let-7c (Figure 5F) (65). However, less work has been done to test the possible effectiveness of combining quercetin with gemcitabine in vivo. In the one available study, Angst et al. showed in an orthotopic model of PDAC that quercetin maintained Figure 4. e ffects of a dietary compound on Pda C: Capsaicin. a. e ffects on tumorigenesis of treatment with gemcitabine coupled with capsaicin (C aPS) and resveratrol (reS) com- bined in a xenograft (Capan-2) model of pancreatic cancer. tumorigenesis was quantified as tumor weight expressed relative to control. the treatments were as follows: control (1), high-dose GeM (2 ), high-dose GeM coupled with C aPS and reS combination (3 ), low-dose GeM (4 ), and low-dose GeM coupled with C aPS and reS combination (5 ). there was no added effect of treatment with high-dose G eM com - bined with C aPS + reS, suggesting a saturating effect of the chemotherapy (3 vs. 2). a lthough low-dose GeM had no effect on tumorigenesis (4 ), combination with C aPS + reS produced a marked inhibitory effect (5 vs. 4, statistics not specified). d otted horizontal line indicates null effect.

Modified from Naumann et al. ( 75).its anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects and reduced tumor weight ( 70). In combination with gem - citabine, quercetin had a noticeably (ca. two-fold) greater effect on proliferative activity. In contrast, the additional effects of quercetin combined with gem- citabine on apoptosis and tumor weight were modest (ca. 10%). However, these effects did not reach sig- nificance, probably due to the limited number of animals used (n = 6) and the inherent variability of in vivo testing especially with combinations of agents (70). In conclusion, the evidence is consistent that quer - cetin suppresses PDAC and potentiates the effect of in vitro. In vivo, also, quercetin produces noticeable anti-PDAC effects, but more work is required to substantiate the evidence for the added benefit of combination with gemcitabine. 2.6. Sulforaphane Cruciferous vegetables, named as such for their cross-shaped flowers, are rich in sulforaphane (other active ingredients include indole-3-carbinol and 3,3-diindolylmethane). Sulforaphane-rich foods include broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, collard greens and kale (Table 1A) (71). Appari et al. showed that three servings of cruciferous vegetables per day was associated with a 50% decrease in PDAC risk ( 72). A more extensive meta-analysis of four cohort and five case-control studies also found that a high intake of cruciferous vegetables decreased PDAC risk significantly by some 20% (71). This was extended to a clinical trial (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ ct2/show/NCT01879878). Thus, Lozanovski et al. reported that PDAC patients consuming sulforaphanes (freeze-dried broccoli) whilst undergoing palliative chemotherapy experienced improved survival albeit for limited time (Figure 6A) (73). A range of anti- cancer modes of action has been associated with sul- foraphane ( 76). In one study, indole-3-carbinol reduced the assembly of prostate cancer cells into organoids (77). This finding could be significant to PDAC due to some similarities with prostate cancer, especially hormone (insulin) sensitivity. Both are also cancers of affluence and express similar stem cell markers (78, 79). Sulforaphane suppressed the genetic damage of carcinogens, induced apoptosis and inhibited prolif- eration of PDAC cells, in culture as well as in vivo (80). Specifically, combining sulforaphane with \"tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand\" (TRAIL) was able to reduce resistance to the drug (81). Furthermore, using a xenograft model of PDAC, synergy between sulforaphane and gemcitabine has been demonstrated in suppressing tumorigenesis and NUTRiTiON AND CANCeR 1147 this involved suppression of Notch signaling and can- cer stem cells (CSCs) (Figure 6B) (74). Finally, com- bining sulforaphane with radiotherapy suppressed PDAC cell viability by increasing cell cycle arrest (Figure 6C) (75). Interestingly, attempts are being made to develop stable synthetic variants of sulfora- phane as anticancer drugs (https://evgen.com/). In conclusion, the available evidence for sulfora- phane is promising as regards its potential both as a preventative agent by itself as well as in combination with chemotherapy, including gemcitabine. 3. Nutraceutical Agents Nutraceuticals are defined generally as natural sub- stances that are not a part of normal diet but can be formulated and consumed as extracts or supplements. We have identified four nutraceutical compounds for which there are promising therapeutic effects (in vitro and/or in vivo) against PDAC and in some cases the associated organs, especially the liver (82). These are listed in Table 1B alongside their chemical formulae, main modes of action/cellular effects and natural sources. 3.1. Artemisinin This compound is isolated from Artemisia annua , sweet wormwood, a herb commonly employed in traditional Chinese medicine against malaria (83). Artemisinin and its derivatives (e.g., dihydroartemisinin) produced a variety of in vitro and in vivo effects against PDAC, including inhibition of growth and induction of apop- tosis (84-86). These effects have been associated with the upregulation of several miRNAs (83). It has also been suggested that artemisinin generates ROS to induce oxidative stress and thereby cell death in PDAC cell lines (87). Additionally, dihydroartemisinin increased T-cell proliferation and activity, which could promote an anticancer immune response (88). Importantly, dihydroartemisnin increased the sensitivity of PDAC in vitro and in vivo to therapies including gemcitabine and TRAIL (85, 89). In a xenograft model of PDAC, dihydroartemisinin significantly potentiated the effect of gemcitabine in supressing tumorigenesis by some 25% (Figure 7A) (85). Histochemical analyses of the tissues from the in vivo experiments showed that the enhancing effect of dihydroartemisinin involved suppression of proliferation and increased apoptosis (Figure 7B and C) (85). Additionally, dihydroartemis- inin was able to sensitize liver cancer cells to gemcit- abine in vivo, thereby further reducing tumor burden significantly (90).In conclusion, artemisinin and its derivatives can produce anti-PDAC effects and potentiate the effec- tiveness of gemcitabine. In addition, it may support liver function (Table 1B). Altogether, therefore, it has great promise for integration into chemotherapy of PDAC.

For both parameters, the effect of the combination was greater than the effect of gemcitabine alone (P < 0.05). From Wang, SJ. et al. ( 85).1148 M. B. A. DJAMGOZ AND v. JeNTZSCH 3.2. Garcinol This is a derivative isolated from Garcinia indica , a plant of the mangosteen family, commonly known as \"kokum\" . It is a potent inhibitor of histone acetyl- transferases, a modulator of gene expression, both in vitro and in vivo. Garcinol could produce a variety of anti-PDAC effects, promoting apoptosis by increas- ing activities of caspase-9 and caspase-3 In Vitro (91). By modulating the expression of miRNAs involved in chemoresistance, garcinol also allowed gemcitabine to become significantly more effective in suppressing proliferation and promoting apoptosis In Vitro (92). Importantly, garcinol could also suppress the self-renewal and tumor-forming ability of CSCs (93). Alone or in combination with gemcitabine, garcinol suppressed tumor growth in a transgenic (KPC) mouse model of PDAC (Figure 8A) (94). Furthermore, pancreatic intraep- ithelial neoplasia (PanIN), combined treatment resulted in disease remaining in earlier stages. Thus, compared with gemcitabine treatment alone, PanIN lesions of all grades were consistently fewer in the combination treatment ( Figure 8B) (94). In conclusion, the available evidence suggests con- sistently that garcinol has significant effects against PDAC in vitro and in vivo and would seem ready to be tested in gemcitabine combination treatments. 3.3. Thymoquinone This is an active ingredient isolated from the black seed, Nigella sativa (Table 1B). It has been investigated for its anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities against PDAC, both in vitro and in vivo, and was found to be effective without significant side effects (95). Thymoquinone also has anticancer including anti-metastatic properties (96). Mahmoud & Abdelrazek reviewed these properties as well as the hepatoprotec- tive effects of thymoquinone (97). Specifically, in PDAC, thymoquinone downregulated the expression of the anti-adhesive protein MUC4, thereby leading to decreased cell motility (98). Several studies have sug- gested a synergistic effect of thymoquinone in combi- nation with gemcitabine. When these agents were combined in vitro, cell viability fell by more than 50% compared with monotherapy (Figure 9A) (99). In a xenograft model of PDAC, combination of thymoqui- none with gemcitabine produced a significantly greater effect (by some 80%) on tumor weight compared with gemcitabine alone (Figure 9B) (99). This effect involved potentiation of caspase (3 and 9) activation, leading to apoptosis (100). This pro-apoptotic effect appeared to be specific to PDAC cells (101). Thymoquinone-induced histone acetylation was proposed to be the basis of its synergy with gemcitabine (102). In conclusion, from the available in vivo combina- tion evidence, supported by in vitro data, we conclude that thymoquinone has excellent potential to be incor - porated into an integrated management regimen for PDAC. 3.4.

Compared with gemcitabine alone, the combination produced consistently greater effects on both PaniN lesions, but noticeably more on PaniN3. However, significance was not reached, probably due to the limited number of animals used in the study (n = 8 in each group) and the inherent variability of the pathology. redrawn from data given in Saadat et al. ( 94).NUTRiTiON AND CANCeR 1149 suppressor genes sup- pressed PDAC cell proliferation ( treatments in vitro, emodin \"sensitized\" a drug-resistant cell line to gemcitabine (Figure In an orthotopic xenograft model of PDAC, emodin promoted the effect of gemcitabine in suppressing tumorigenesis (Figure 10B) (106). The effects of emodin involved increased apoptosis and inhibited angiogenesis with possible transcriptional control via NF-B (106-109). Finally, in a mouse model of PDAC, emodin dose-dependently decreased metastasis to liver by up to ca. 50% whilst \"normalising\" miR1271 expression and inhibiting EMT (107). In vitro and in vivo, liver cancer itself benefited from emodin treatment which also enhanced the effectiveness of a biological (sorafenib) therapy (110). Finally, also in an in vivo mouse model, cachexia could be reversed by long-term treatment with emodin and this occurred through decreased hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) - 1 signaling (111). In conclusion, emodin can produce beneficial effects against PDAC, as well as liver cancer, by itself and can potentiate the effectiveness of gemcitabine in vitro and in vivo. Thus, it could be considered for clinical application.

Further Emerging Potential Complementary Agents We should note that there are a number of other \"agents\" (dietary and nutraceutical) with anti-PDAC properties but for which evidence is mainly from In Vitro experiments and no In Vivo combination data are available. Such emerging agents are noted here with the expectation that the evidence in their favor could become stronger in time. Some examples of these emerging agents include the following. 4.1. Lycopene This is the red pigment that gives red and pink fruit, such as tomatoes, watermelons, pink grapefruit and guava their characteristic color. A meta-analysis of 18 eligible studies concluded that lycopene intake and PDAC risk were inversely correlated (112). This con- clusion was supported later by the mechanistic demon- stration that lycopene induces apoptosis in PDAC cells (113). Thus, the overall evidence for the anti-PDAC role of lycopene is significant. However, it has never been tested in combination therapies. Lycopene can also protect against acute pancreatitis and diabetes (e.g., Refs. 114, 115). Accordingly, lycopene may cur - rently be used in a preventative setting. Although it is not known if it would potentiate gemcitabine che- motherapy of PDAC, it could reduce or even prevent the side effects of chemotherapy due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties (116, 117). 4.2. Zinc This is an essential mineral found naturally in high concentrations in oysters, crab, beans and pumpkin seeds. It is frequently mentioned as an anticancer agent but the evidence for its possible anti-PDAC effect is quite contradictory (118-120). This is prob- ably due to the multi-faceted role of this metal as a structural component of many proteins and a co-factor in enzymatic reactions. Overall, a meta-analysis con- cluded that high consumption of zinc was associated with a decreased risk of PDAC ( 121). Consistent with this, more recent evidence has concluded that zinc dyshomeostasis (caused by the dysfunction of zinc transporters) can contribute to the initiation and/or progression of various cancers, including PDAC (122). Accordingly, the zinc ionophore, clioquinol, was sug- gested to be efficacious against PDAC (123). Furthermore, \"Bhasma\" (incinerated processed zinc widely used in Ayurveda for various ailments) could also be effective against PDAC (124). Finally, zinc could protect against cachexia in PDAC (125). While there is no evidence for possible synergy between chemotherapy and zinc, it has been deemed acceptable for treatment of liver disease (126, 127). 4.3. Selenium Selenium is a trace element that plants accumulate from soil and convert to organic forms. Thus, it is naturally present in many foods, especially Brazil nuts, seafood, pasta and eggs. Han X et al. originally reported anti-PDAC effects of selenium (128, 129). A meta-analysis and a later nested case-control study found no adverse effect on PDAC but a negative asso- ciation was apparent for patients with body mass index (BMI) higher than 25 (130, 131). Beneficial effects and no adverse effects have also been reported against diabetes (132-134). However, high-level con- sumption could promote insulin resistance and should be avoided (135). 4.4. Magnesium Magnesium-rich foods include dark-green leafy veg- etables, seeds, wholegrains, fish and nuts. A recent study revealed significantly lower levels of magnesium in urine of PDAC patients compared to healthy con- trols ( 136). Consistent with this, a prospective cohort study showed that magnesium supplementation may help prevent PDAC (137). Mechanistic evidence sug- gested (i) that Mg2+-permeant ion channels associate with PDAC (138) and (ii) that the Mg2+ transporter protein SLC41A1 could be a viable anti-PDAC target (139). Indirectly, also, magnesium may reduce the risk of PDAC through its well-established negative rela- tionship with diabetes (140, 141). 4.5. Plumbagin This is a derivative of naphthalene obtained from the roots of the \"chitrak\" that has been used in Ayuverdic medicine for more than 2,500 years. A bioinformatics study revealed several \"mainstream\" cancer signaling mechanisms whereby plumbagin could affect survival, apoptosis and metabolism in PDAC cells (142). Indeed, experimentally, plumbagin has been shown to inhibit the growth of PDAC cells (including CSCs) and induce autophagy in vitro and in vivo and may target the tumor suppressor p53 (142-145). Most recently, Pandey et al. showed that plumbagin induced apoptosis in PDAC cells both in monolayers and three-dimensional tumor spheroids (146). This effect NUTRiTiON AND CANCeR 1151 involved production of ROS and cleavage of caspases 3 and 9. Work is ongoing to develop nanoparticles of plumbagin as an anti-angiogenic drug (147). 4.6. Milk Thistle This has been used as a traditional herbal remedy for almost 2000 years. Its active ingredient, silymarin (major constituent, silibinin/silybin) has been shown to inhibit proliferative activity and angiogenesis in models of PDAC (148). Silibinin also promoted via- bility and promoted apoptosis and autophagy in human PDAC cells (149). These effects were mediated by increased \"stress-activated protein kinase\" (JNK/ SAPK) signaling. Used by itself, silibinin could sup- press tumor growth and cachexia in in vivo mouse models of PDAC (150). Silibinin is also well known for its \"hepatoprotective\" property and for promoting liver regeneration (151). Indeed, a randomized phase two clinical trial on childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) undergoing chemotherapy employed in combination silymarin (milk thistle extract) with the aim of reducing liver toxicity and a positive effect was reported ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/ NCT00055718) (151). 4.7. Berberine This is an isoquinoline alkaloid extracted from a vari- ety of natural herbs ( 152). Its molecular targets include upregulation of tumor suppressor genes, acti- vation of AMPK and downregulation of matrix metal - loproteinase production, leading to decreased cellular proliferation and invasion (153). In vitro, berberine induced apoptosis and suppressed the CSC population in PDAC cell lines even more effectively than gem- citabine (154, 155). Another study showed that ber - berine inhibited PDAC cell viability by dysregulating cellular energetics by targeting citrate metabolism (156). In vivo, also, berberine could reduce tumor growth in mouse models of PDAC (157). In addition, berberine demonstrated insulin-regulating properties and could suppress PDAC also indirectly (158). Consistent with this, it could potentiate the therapeu- tic effect of metformin (see section 5.2) (159). 4.8. Ginseng Panax ginseng (\"ginseng\") is a perennial plant that grows in East Asia. It is a traditional medicinal herb with a unique family of active saponin ingredients called \"ginsenosides\" . It is available in various forms (e.g., fresh, white, steamed, acid-processed and fer - mented) leading to a range ginsenoside compositions with diverse pharmacological properties (160). Yun & Choi found in an early case-control study concluded ginseng consumption would reduce the risk of PDAC and liver cancer (161, 162). Experimentally, extracts of ginseng (leaves, flowers and roots) and some nanoparticle preparations have been tested against various human PDAC cell lines and shown to inhibit cell viability, proliferation and angiogenesis whilst promoting apoptosis (e.g., Refs. 163-165 ). Some anti-PDAC effects have also been reported in vivo (166, 167). Furthermore, ginseng could delay the development of type 1 diabetes and pancreatitis, both PDAC risk factors, in rats (168, 169). Finally, ginseng has also been reported to enhance the effectiveness of in vitro gemcitabine (and some other chemother - apeutic agents) on PDAC cells as well as liver, lung and prostate cancers (170-172). 5. Drug Combinations Drug combinations refer to more than one drug being taken together. Although this topic is outside the immediate scope of the current review, as another \"combination, \" we would like to highlight it here for awareness and possible benefit to patients (173). In fact, use of drug combinations is common in cancer therapy and is already applied to PDAC in the form of FOLFIRINOX. A novel approach is including in the combination a drug that has been developed and prescribed for conditions other than cancer (a practice known as \"repurposing\"). We highlight here two examples of such drug combinations. 5.1. Aspirin This is a natural agent used commonly against pain and inflammation. Its general health benefits including anticancer properties have been highlighted over many years ( 174, 175). However, caution has also been expressed as regards its possible detrimental side effects on uncontrolled high blood pressure, bleeding disorders, asthma and stomach ulcers (176, 177). As regards PDAC, evidence suggests that high and medium usage (one or more 75 mg tablet a day) may reduce the risk by as much as 50%, the risk of those who stop taking it subsequently increasing ( 178, 179). This is through its inhibition of the COX-2 enzyme which indeed is upregulated in PDAC and may pro- mote the disease by enhancing inflammation, a risk factor for PDAC (180). A negative association between 1152 M. B. A. DJAMGOZ AND v. JeNTZSCH aspirin use and PDAC risk was demonstrated from a meta-analysis (Figure 11A) (181, 183). The association was stronger with increased frequency and duration of aspirin consumption (178, 181, 184). The apparent time-dependent correlation could be due to the fact that development of PDAC begins long before its diagnosis so, to derive benefit, consumption of aspirin should start well before occurrence (185). In terms of \"combination therapy, \" aspirin proved an effective adjuvant to gemcitabine in the treatment of PDAC in an in vivo transgenic mouse model (186). This study also showed that the combined treatment prolonged survival by ca. 30% over gemcitabine treat - ment alone. In an extensive, combined in vitro and in vivo study, including cells taken from PDAC patients, aspirin (at clinical doses) enhanced the effec- tiveness of gemcitabine in suppressing tumorigenesis (Figure 11B) (182). The effect involved induction of apoptosis, reduction of cell viability and expression of proteins involved in inflammation and stem cell signaling (182). This study also showed that the aspi- rin + gemcitabine combination significantly prolonged the survival of mice, by some 40%, compared with gemcitabine alone ( Figure 11C ). Importantly, also, aspirin sensitized cells that were resistant to gemcit- abine (182, 187). In a more recent phase 1b clinical trial, aspirin has been included as a part of an immu- notherapy/vaccination regime against PDAC (Ref: CHUV-DO-0017_PC-PEPDC_2017) (188). In conclusion, aspirin can be taken safely in a pre- ventative setting and can also be used in combination with gemcitabine chemotherapy to improve treatment efficacy. 5.2. Metformin Metformin is the most common oral drug prescribed for type II diabetes (189). Epidemiological evidence suggests that diabetics treated with metformin are less likely to develop PDAC (190). Indeed, meta-analyses revealed that metformin treatment increased survival in diabetic PDAC patients as well as presumed non-diabetics (190, 191). By inhibiting oxidative phosphorylation, metformin reduces levels of the energy rich compound adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in cells, which in turn downreg- ulates signaling mechanisms involved in cellular sur - vival and proliferation (192). Consistent with this, a study on a transgenic mouse model found that met- formin reduced PDAC incidence (quantified by PanIN pathology) by up to 50% (193). Importantly, in in Figure 11. d rug combination: effects of combining aspirin with chemotherapy. a.

B and C, from Zhang, Y. et al. ( 182).NUTRiTiON AND CANCeR 1153 vivo mouse models of PDAC, metformin reduced CSC proliferation as well as infiltration and activation of tumor-associated macrophages which contribute to desmoplasia (194). Thus, metformin could induce stromal depletion and enhance penetration of a nanoparticulate form of gemcitabine (195). There is also increasing evidence that metformin can enhance the effectiveness of gemcitabine (196, 197). Li, X. et al. performed a meta-analysis of rather dis- parate data and concluded that patients taking met- formin (with or without chemotherapy) had improved overall survival compared with a control group not taking metformin (Figure 12A) (198). Subgroup analysis showed that the effect of metformin correlated with tumor stage and was associated with improved survival in patients who had surgery or locally advanced cancer, but not in patients with metastatic disease (198). The apparent improvement of effectiveness of che- motherapy by metformin is also supported by in vitro experiments involving several human PDAC cell lines (202, 203). In another study, even resistance to gem- citabine was reversed by metformin, albeit in vitro Figure 12. d rug combination: effects of adding metformin to chemotherapy. a.

However, this study involved (i) murine cell lines and (ii) the concentration of metformin used (20 mM) was rather high (cf. Ref. 192). Also, in an in vivo mouse xeno- graft model of PDAC, metformin demonstrated anti- tumor activity against a drug-resistant tumor (199). Combination of gemcitabine with metformin gener - ated a noticeably further reduction in tumor weight, compared with the effect of gemcitabine alone (Figure 12B) (199). Furthermore, in xenograft and genetically engineered mouse models of PDAC, metformin enhanced significantly the effect of gemcitabine in improving survival (Figure 12C) (200). This enhance- ment effect was suggested to involve inhibition of CSCs and suppression of angiogenesis (200, 206). Synergistic effects of combining metformin with radiation (plus gemcitabine in some cases) were observed in PDAC cells in vitro (Figure 12D) (201). This \"radiosensitization\" effect was thought to involve AMPK (201, 202). Several clinical trials are evaluating the anti-PDAC potential of metformin by itself and in combined administration with chemotherapy (gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel) and radiotherapy. The trials that have been concluded so far were those on late-stage or gemcitabine-resistant disease and, unfortunately, did not find significant improvement by adding metformin (207, 208). Other trials are still to report. In conclusion, there is promising preclinical evi- dence that metformin can be added safely as an adju- vant to chemotherapy of PDAC. Currently, this would appear more promising for early-stage disease. 6. Future Perspectives and Conclusion In our previous study, supported by clinical trial data, we identified six dietary and three nutraceutical agents for integration with gemcitabine chemotherapy of PDAC ( 16). Here, based upon more limited available evidence, we evaluated another 10 agents (six dietary and four nutraceutical) which, in due course, may be added to the kind of integrative scheme we presented earlier. In fact, remembering the direness of PDAC, these 10 agents could even be introduced into inte- grated management now since, although the evidence in their favor is limited, there is no associated adverse effect. In addition to the incorporation of such agents, one should remember that integrative lifestyle factors should also be considered for completeness. These would include limited alcohol intake, no smoking, and regular exercise and avoiding obesity (16). In overall conclusion, cancer-causing processes can be suppressed, and current treatment methods can be potentiated significantly by integrating with comple- mentary factors to the extent that it may ultimately be possible to live with cancer chronically (Figure 13) (209). In fact, any improvement to life expectancy would be hugely beneficial to PDAC patients as research continues intensely in this field and new clinical therapies as well as novel integration regimes can be expected. In further evaluating the kinds of dietary and nutraceutical agents covered here, a number of issues should be born in mind. These were covered in some detail by Jentzsch et al. ( 16). Some key issues are the quality of the agents and the possible personalized nature of their effects. Future research should aim at ascertaining such issues as well as determining the molecular mechanisms/modes of action of the emerg- ing agents and, most importantly, extending the eval- uations to clinical trials. In overall conclusion, both existing and emerging evidence strongly suggests that introduction of com- plementary agents and lifestyle factors into main- stream treatment of PDAC can produce significant beneficial effects, as regards both disease status and its side effects (16, 210).
