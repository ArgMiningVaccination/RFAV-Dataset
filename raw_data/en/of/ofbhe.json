There are many forms of meditation, but the meditation taught at Simply Sentient Detox is based on the principle \"as you think so you become\". In meditation one should concentrate one's mind on a positive and uplifting thought. If one does this on a regular basis it leads to a profound state of peace and harmony. Our instructors, who have years of experience, will show you how to meditate using proven techniques that will enable you to withdraw your mind from the distractions of the \"outside\" world and concentrate within. Meditation quiets the central nervous system, lowers blood pressure by as much as 20% and has a profound effect on physical health. In addition the regular practice of meditation builds up a person's capacity to pay attention and learn anything, making it the best form of mental exercise. As the mind is drawn within we experience a deeper sense of peace and harmony with life by concentrating on the infinite. With a calm body, a controlled mind and a blissful spirit, we become more ideal human beings, who are ready to render dynamic social service to the world.
