Ayurveda \u2014 which means \"science of life\" \u2014 is a traditional system of medicine originating in ancient India. Ayurveda is a comprehensive, prevention-oriented system of natural health that addresses the body, mind and environment of the individual in order to provide a holistic cure. MIU teaches Maharishi AyurVeda, a unique form of ayurveda that has been re-evaluated from a scientific perspective for modern day use. Our programs integrate Maharishi AyurVeda with the modern, scientific understanding of health to take an integrated approach to medicine. Prevention-oriented Healthcare In a world where medicine mostly revolves around the treatment of illness and disease, the ability to prevent illness in the first place is becoming increasingly valuable. Prevention is a core trait of Maharishi AyurVeda. Through a variety of healing modalities, Maharishi AyurVeda works to create total health in the individual, therefore stopping illness and disease before they even arise. Approaching Health from Every Angle Maharishi AyurVeda is a comprehensive system that takes mind, body, behavior and environment into consideration when recommending treatments. Treatments often include diet and lifestyle recommendations that promote general wellness. For example, ayurvedic health tips include getting the right amount of sleep every night, eating lunch as the largest meal of the day, and using healthy spices (like turmeric) in cooking. Other treatment modalities common in Maharishi AyurVeda include: - Practice of the Transcendental Meditation\u00ae technique to bring balance and peace to the mind and body - Use of yoga poses (asanas) to bring balance, flexibility, and coordination to the mind and body - Reading the pulse to detect imbalances and conditions - Preparing herbal formulas and specialized diets to promote and restore mental and physical balance - Aligning one's daily and seasonal routines with the cycles of nature Self Care and Student Health Students at MIU learn to use many of the modalities of Maharishi AyurVeda to maintain their own health, including self-pulse assessment, yoga asanas, the Transcendental Meditation technique, individualized diet, and daily and seasonal routine.
