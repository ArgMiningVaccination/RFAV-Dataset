Cooler air will enter through the many small holes that go down through the surface of the memory foam and out through the convoluted channels on the firmer base foam.It also works in reverse, as air can enter through the sides and up through the surface holes. This unique system also allows a heat transfer as the warmer air radiates off the body and ventilates down through the holes and out the sides of the mattress. That is why breathable fabric is always where the channels exit on the sides of the mattress. In addition, a greater volume of airflow transfer will occur with even the slightest movements that occur throughout the sleeping process. While some mattress companies offer airflow through the middle layer of the mattress, they fall short of allowing the mattress user to receive any airflow benefit, since it is well known that good quality memory foam as well as gel infused foam does not breathe well due to its heavier weight and compact cell structure (the very reason that memory foam feels so dense when you lay on it). That is why this patented airflow circulation technology will really keep your body temperature constant throughout the night. Call us today for all of the details and why we recommend it so highly!
