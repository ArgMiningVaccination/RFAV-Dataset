BC Cancer Protocol Summary (Patient Version) LUSCDURPE (Carboplatin Option) Page 3 of 14 Developed: 1 Oct 2022 Revised: What will happen when I get my drugs? A blood test is done within one month of starting treatment. A blood test is also done each cycle, on or before the first day of each cycle. The dose and timing of your chemotherapy may be changed based on your blood counts and/or other side effects. You will see a physician or nurse practitioner every 3 or 4 weeks, before each cycle. Your very first treatment will take longer than other treatments because a nurse will be reviewing the possible side effects of your chemotherapy plan and will discuss with you how to manage them. It is a good idea to bring someone with you to your first chemot herapy appointment. You will be given a prescription for anti -nausea medications (to be filled at your regular pharmacy). Please bring your anti -nausea medications with you for each treatment. Your nurse will tell you when to take the anti -nausea medication. You will also need to take your anti -nausea drugs at home after therapy. It is easier to prevent nausea than to treat it once it has occurred, so follow directions closely.
