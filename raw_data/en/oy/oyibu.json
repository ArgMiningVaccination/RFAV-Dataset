Innovation One successful CMI project involves several National Lab Team Members and Eck Industries. This project produced castable Ce-modified Al alloys that have the ability to fill a vacant spot in the aluminum alloys family. The alloys maintain their mechanical properties to a higher temperature than currently available alloys and thus create a high temperature aluminum alloy with mechanical characteristic improvements upwards of 30% over other Al alloys in similar high temperature applications. Previously existing aluminum alloys which can function at high temperature are too cost prohibitive for wide - spread application due to the ir use of elements such as scandium and zirconium. Cerium modification of Aluminum alloys will serve to create an as -of-yet unseen opportunity for Aluminum alloys to be utilized in high temperature applications, such as automotive engines; where before, s uch an application was limited to much denser and thus heavier alloys. Outcomes Technology Advancement The CMI's emphasis on collaboration at every stage of research and development has produced over 100 invention disclosures since its inception in 2013, r esulting in eight patents to date, numerous patent applications, and several technologies licensed. Impact Several of the research projects being undertaken by the CMI include its Industrial Team Members who are participating in the research every step of the way. Using this approach, the CMI is able to consistently focus on the economic and manufacturing feasibility of the technologies it's developing. \"There ha s been tremendous interest from industry due to the unique material properties and low cost of this alloy. This project is a template for rapid development and commercialization. Not only did we bridge the research 'valley of death,' we also developed a highway for communication from our customers to us to help guide the project.\" David Weiss, Vice President of Engineering/R&D, Eck Industries Timeline 2013: DOE establishes the Critical Materials Institute (CMI) headquartered at the Ames Laboratory to develop solutions to domestic shortages of rare earth metals and other materials critical for U.S. energy security. 2015: Several National Lab CMI Team Mem bers -Modified Al Alloys . 2017: Eck Industries exclusively licenses the technology. 2018: Patent issues. 1 U.S. Dept. of Energy, Ames Laboratory mark new era in critical materials research with new Energy Innovat ion Hub (September 10, 2013 Ames Laboratory Press Release ) 2 Eck Industries exclusively licenses cerium -aluminum alloy co - developed by ORNL (June 7, 2017 ORNL Press Release) Picture of aluminum -cerium -magnesium engine part cast by Eck Industries. Success Story from FY17 Published March 2019 energy.gov/technologytransitions Success Stories Moving Innovative Technologies from DOE National Laboratories to the Marketplace Fundamental Advances for High Quality/Low Cost Feedstock Powders Ames laboratory Increasing the quality of gas atomization for powder production. Innovation Fundamental process modeling and simulation enables precise gas atomization to produce highest quality additive manufacturing ( AM) feedstocks by high volume/low cost manufacturing method. Conventional gas atomized powders, even those produced by aerospace -qualified powder makers, are far from ideal feedstock powders for either laser or e -beam melted (EBM) methods of AM. Also, EBM pow ders tend to have \"satellite\" projections and poor flowability for build layer spreading and high internal porosity (20 -30%) that causes harmful porosity in AM builds. Atomization process modeling, verified by experiments, demonstrated efficiency and effec tiveness at solving these problems. Outcomes Technology Advancement Adaptation of compressible flow modeling to incorporate high density liquid metals permitted ground -breaking simulation of supersonic gas atomization of molten metal in full 2 -D to analyze melt break -up into droplets that solidify into sp herical powders for use in AM. 2-D break -up simulations compared well with high speed video imaging of comparable gas atomization experiments (see Figure), permitting selection of modest gas velocities for producing EBM powder feedstock with extremely low interior porosity (4%), compared to 20 -30% for typical commercial powder. While further 3 -D simulation of droplet breakup will permit powder size predictions, empirical data allowed a greatly enhanced (3x ) powder yield (50 -60%) to be achieved in experiments performed with AMES gas atomizer, compared to commercial practice . Impact With sufficient industry adoption of the methods and controls for precision gas atomization from this project, the cost for highes t quality powder (500 -1000/kg), from plasma rotating electrode process (PREP), can be reduced by about 10 times . \"One of the highest barriers to broad adoption of additive manufacturing will tumble down if precision gas atomization becomes common industrial practice.\" Dr. Iver Anderson, Senior Metallurgist, Ames Laboratory Timeline 2017: Ames shipped re -designed MAR -M-247 powder to ORNL for AM trails where the EMB powder yield was 56 %.1,2 1 Hernandez, F.H., Riedemann, T., Tiarks, J., Kong, B., Anderson, I.E., Ward, T., Regele, J.D. \"Simulation of primary breakup in planar close -coupled gas atomization,\" in proceedings of 14th International Conference on Liquid Atomization and Spray Systems, 198 (2018). 2 Hernandez, F.H., Riedemann, T., Tiarks, J., Kong, B., Anderson, I.E., Ward, T., Regele, J.D. \"Close -coupled gas atomizati on and nozzle gas dynamics, part (2): Simulation,\" in proceedings of Advances in powder metallurgy and particulate materials, pp. 35 -54.

Innovation Titanium powder cr eated with Ames Laboratory -developed gas - atomization technology is being successfully marketed by Praxair Inc., which offers fine, spherical titanium powder for additive manufacturing and metal injection molding of aerospace, medical and industrial parts. It marks the first time large -scale amounts of titanium powder are available to industry with a potential for low -cost, high -volume manufacturing. Outcomes Technology Advancement Titanium's strength, light weight, biocompatibility and resistance to corrosi on make it ideal for use in parts ranging from aircraft wing structures to replacement knee joints and medical instruments. Using ultra -fine, high -purity spherical titanium powder to 3 -D print or mold these parts generates 10 times less metal waste than tr aditional casting of parts. Impact Two former Ames Laboratory employees Joel Rieken and Andy Heidloff, created a spinoff company, Iowa Powder Atomization Technologies (IPAT), to exclusively license Ames Laboratory's titanium atomization patents. IPAT scien tists worked to further optimize the titanium atomization process and along the way won several business and technology awards for their efforts, including the Department of Energy's Next Top Energy Innovator competition in 2012. IPAT was acquired by Praxa ir, a Fortune 250 company and one of the world's largest producers of gases and surface coatings in 2014, and Praxair began marketing titanium powder the following year. \"Titanium powder made with this technology has huge potential to save manufacturers materials and money.\" Dr. Iver Anderson, Senior Metallurgist, Ames Laboratory \"Praxair Surface Technologies has chosen to commercialize the titanium ato mization technology from Ames and also to hire two of the three investigators (Heidloff and Rieken) that were responsible for this unique titanium atomization process.\" Dean Hackett, Vice President Praxair Surface Technologies, Inc.

Success Story from FY16 Published March 2019 energy.gov/technologytransitions Success Stories Moving Innovative Technologies from DOE National Laboratories to the Marketplace Argonne helps Aramco Research Center -Detroit Slash Engine and Fuel Design Time and C ost Argonne National Laboratory in conjunction with Aramco Research Center -Detroit Accelerating engine design through supercomputing. Innovation In 2017, Argonne scientists and engineers pinpointed engine designs for a given fuel using the Mira supercomputer at the heart of the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility, a Department of Energy Office of Science User Facility. Outcomes Technology Advancement With Mira's supercomputing prowess, Argonne's Virtual Engine Research Institute and Fuels Initiative (VERIFI) team simulated more than 2,000 engine design combinations. The simulations were conducted with design scenarios from the Aramco Research Center -Detroit, one of three U.S. -based research centers operated by Saudi Aramco's North American subsidiary, Aramco Services Company . The work was conducted as part of a Stra tegic Partnership Project (SPP) . Impact The Argonne approach \"reduced design time from months to weeks,\" said Sibendu Som, group leader and principal computational scientist at Argonne. This significant reduction i n design time translated to significant cost savings. \"The simulations performed by Argonne found two optimized fuel -engine concepts that could improve fuel efficiency substantially.\" Yuanjiang Pei, Lab Scientist, Aramco Research Center -Detroit Timeline 2017: Argonne scientists use Mira supercomputer to pinpoint engine designs By tapping into Argonne 's high -performance computing resources and expertise, Aramco Research Center -Detroit streamlined its engine and fuel design process. Success Story from FY17 Published March 2019 Success Story from FY17 Published March 2019 energy.gov/technologytransitions Success Stories Moving Innovative Technologies from DOE National Laboratories to the Marketplace Companies T ap into Argonne's Self-Healing Coating that could Revolutionize Lubrication Argonne National Laboratory in conjunction with the DOE Office of Science and Lawren ce Be rkeley National Laboratory Developing a self -lubricating film that can greatly improve engine durability. Innovation Argonne researchers have developed an ultra -durable, self - lubricating tribofilm - a film that forms between moving surfaces - that could have profound implications for the efficiency and durability of engines and other machinery with moving metal parts . Outcomes Technology Advancement The tribofilm reduces friction by 25 -40 percent a nd wear to unmeasurable values. As such, it holds promise for significantly reducing energy consumption in a range of applications and greatly extending the life of hardware. In addition, because the tribofilm regenerates itself as it is worn away, it coul d greatly reduce the need for maintenance and the associated costs. Impact In 2017, Argonne entered into Strategic Partnership Project s (SPP 's) with Nissan - which has production facilities in Tennessee and Mississippi - and Hyundai - which has a production facility in Alabama - to explore application of the technology in the automaker s' engines. Also in 2017, Argonne and Magna Services of America - headquart ered in Troy, Mich. - won a Technology Commercialization Fund award from the Department of Energy (DOE) to explore the application of the technology to increase the service interval of automotive powertrain applications. \"This is a ver y unique discovery. We have developed many types of diamond -like carbon coatings of our own, but we've never found one that generates itself.\" Ali Erdemir, Argonne Distinguished Fellow, Argonne National Laboratory 1 \"Hard, Slick and Ready to Roll.\" Automotive Engineering . March shmoil Argonne creates regenerating engine coating .\" Chicago Tribune 2016. from lubricating oils .\" Nature 536 67-71 (August 2016). Argonne researchers have demonst rated that, with the design of catalytically active surface layers, they can crack long -chain hydrocarbon molecules of base oils and turn them into diamond -like carbon tribofilms and other forms of carbon nanostructures on rubbing surfaces. Success Story from FY17 Published March 2019 energy.gov/technologytransitions Success Stories Moving Innovative Technologies from DOE National Laboratories to the Marketplace Argonne's NMC Cathode T echnology a \"Game -Changer\" in the Batter y Industry Argonne National Laboratories in conjunction with the Department of Energy Improving cathode technology to make lithium -ion battery technology cheaper and more efficient. Innovation Argonne's Nickel Manganese Cobalt (NMC) cathode technology represents an advancement in lithium -ion battery technology from earlier cathode chemistries. Nickel and manganese are considerably cheaper than cobalt, and batteries wit h NMC cathodes perform better than those with alternative cathode chemistries . Outcomes Technology Advancement NMC has become a dominant focus for cathode mat erial development in the market, as it improves lithium -ion battery performance while reducing manufacturing cost and environmental impac t. Applications for the technology include batteries in personal electronic devices, power tools, and hybrid electric vehicles. Additionally, NMC promises to be a key technology for enabling large -scale energy grid storage. Impact In 2008, the NMC technology was licensed by Toda Kogyo, a respected supplier of materials in the lithium -ion and nickel - metal hydride battery markets. In 2009, BASF Corporation, the largest affiliate of BASF SE and the second -largest producer of chemicals and related products in North America, with 20,000 employees in the U.S., licensed the NMC cathode technology and has invested in further research and development as well as faciliti es to produce NMC -based products. Most notable is a 70,000 -square -foot plant BASF opened in Elyria, Ohio, in 2012 to produce NMC materials. BASF invested $50 million in the construction, which was also supported by a $24.6 million grant from DOE . In 2011, both General Motors and LG Chem licensed the NMC technology. NMC is a key enabling component in the battery that powers GM's Chevrolet Bolt, the 2017 Motor Trend Car of the Year and one of Time magazine's 25 Best Inventions of 2016 . \"NMC has been a game -changer in the industry. People are using this Argonne technology without even knowing it, and we fully expect they will be using it more and more.\" Mike Fetcenko, Director of Battery Materials, BASF C orporation Timeline 2008: NMC technology was licensed by Toda Kogyo 2009: NMC technology was licensed by BASF Corporation 2010: Argonne and BASF received a \"Deals of Distinction\" Award in 2010 from the Licensing Executives Society, Inc. 2011: NMC technology is licensed by General Motors and LG Chem 1 \"BASF Cathode Material Production Plant, Elyria, Ohio, US .\" \" BASF start s electric car battery materials production in Elyria .\" The Plain Dealer .

The T7 RNA polymerase is so active that a small basal level of T7 polymerase can lead to substantial expression of target protein even in the absence of added inducer. If the target protein is sufficiently toxic to the host cell, then the auto induction of the target protein due to the small basal level of T7 polymerase will pose a substantial challenge in the establishment of the target plasmid in the expression host. Dr. Studier addressed this challenge by formulating g rowth media recipes and protocols that allow for reliable growth of T7 expression strains to saturation with little or no induction. Outcomes Technology Advancement The growth media and protocols developed for use with the T7 expression system, are applicable to other existing expression systems inducible by IPTG or arabinose and potentially to any expression system with an inducer whose action is blocked by glucose. The simplicity of the protocol in using the auto - inducing media allows for efficient screening of many clones in parallel for expression and solubility, as cultures have only to be inoculated and grown to saturation. Impact Using the T7 protein expression system, researchers in academia and industry have used E.coli to express several human proteins, including Insulin to treat diabetes . The yields of target protein using the autoinduction media is typically several -fold higher than that obtained by convent ional IPTG induction. EMD Millipore is currently manufacturing and selling the auto induction media to academic institutions, biotech and pharmaceutical companies. The media is being used by biotech companies and pharma to express life -saving proteins incl uding enzymes and therapeutics. \"Auto -induction simplifies, increases the efficiency, and reduces the cost of producing proteins from cloned genes in the T7 expression system in E. coli (a system previously invented and patented at BNL and successfully licensed for commercial use). It also expands the ability to produce many different proteins in parallel and is applicable to other inducible protein - productio n systems as well.\" William Studier Emeritus, Brookhaven National Laboratory Timeli ne 2003: Auto -induction media was licensed by EMD Biosciences and the licensee launched the auto -induction media in the market 2007 -2008: Follow -on patent applications were filed 2017 : The licensee sublicensed the technology to additional companies 2018: Dr. Studier, the inventor of the technology, was elected as the fellow of the National Academy of Inventors for his work on this technology and the T7 protein expression system that is widely used by scientists to express recombinant proteins in bacteria Better recombinant protein yields with Overnight Express auto -induction (OEI) media compared to manual IPTG induction protocol.

Innovation The KRUSTY demonstration, co -funded by NASA and the Department of Energy (DOE) / National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), is a milestone in the creation of a small, safe, reliable nuclear power source . The Kilopower concept, a kilowatt -range nuclear reactor using an HEU -Mo metallic fuel core, was a 2013 R&D 100 Award winner (Los Alamos National Laborato ry, NASA, and National Security Technologies). Outcomes Technology Advancement With the expertise and creative thinking of Y -12 engineers and fabricators, Y -12 successfully provided depleted uranium - molybdenum prototype components to Glenn Research Center for preliminary thermal testing in November 2016. NASA personnel and other team members, including Y -12 personnel assembled and initiated electrically heated thermal testing of the prototype power system. Based on the prototype test results and fabricatio n and project lessons learned, Y -12 was able to cast and machine the HEU -Mo components that were delivered to NNSS for testing that resulted in the reactor subassembly (core, reflector, and shielding) achieving criticality on Nov. 16, 2017. With the valid ation of the reactor subassembly, Los Alamos National Laboratory and NASA engineers/scientists will now integrate the reactor with the power subassembly and proceed toward the full power, full temperature KRUSTY demonstration by the end of the 2nd Quarter FY18. Impact This nuclear power source is under consideration for NASA as a method for spacecraft and planetary surface power for long - term missions. This experiment also allowed NNSA to obtain valuable benchmark nuclear cross -section data for DOE/NNSA's Nuclear Criticality Safety Program (NCSP).

Innovation Fermilab has partnered with the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) to develop a powerful, compact and inexpensive particle accelerator that can be used to strengthen materials such as plastics, rubber and industrial coatings. The accelerator will direct a high -power beam of electrons at the material, altering its properties. The result would be a higher -durability surface whose extended life could translate into enormous economic benefits. And thanks to the accelerator's portability \u2014 less th an a meter -and-a-half long \u2014 materials can be treated in situ. Outcomes Technology Advancement The accelerator, which is currently in development, is based on high -efficiency, superconducting radio -frequency technology (SRF), which allows it to operate wi th very low cooling losses. This in turn lets operators dispense with the cryogens typically used in accelerator operation, dramatically simplifying the system and reducing the machine's size and weight. Impact One of the areas where such a compact acceler ator could have a significant impact is in extending the life of roads and pavement, potentially saving the United States billions of dollars per year on road repair. Small and light enough to be skid-mounted, the accelerator could be taken directly onto t he roadways to treat the asphalt. Through an Interagency Agreement between the ERDC and the U.S. Department of Energy, the Illinois Accelerator Research Center (IARC) at Fermilab is working with ERDC to develop the advanced materials and accelerator techno logies that will improve the strength, weather resistance, toughness, chemical resistance, and service life of paved surfaces. And its use would extend beyond industrial materials. Electron beams generated by a compact SRF accelerator could cleanly and ch eaply treat wastewater and sterilize medical equipment or build parts and tooling in the additive -metal manufacturing industry, where current machines are limited by beam power. \"The Compact SRF Accelerator technology developed by Fermilab and the IARC team has many applications to ERDC research that could advance technology breakthroughs. We are particularly interested in the Compact SRF Accelerator's potential application in nov el, high -performance pavements. Because it is small and light enough to be truck -mounted, the Compact SRF Accelerator can be used to crosslink or polymerize new pavement materials in situ , giving engineers more freedom to tailor the material to the environment and its purpose. We are collaborating with IARC to study a variety of promising materials.\" John F.

Innovation The electromagnetic mop system works b ecause micron -sized magnetite particles will mix with oil more readily than water when these filings are spread on an oil -water mixture. The particles form a unique and preferential bond with the oil due to a combination of forces, forming a loose colloida l suspension. The filings are magnetic, so they can be moved by a typical magnet. This allows one to use magnetic fields to manipulate, trap, and remove the oil in an environmentally safe manner with high efficiency. Natural Science is applying the license d technology to an electromagnetic boom system that will replace the standard (and inefficient) passive boom and skimmer systems used today. Outcomes Technology Advancement Natural Science, LLC and Fermilab announced an exclusive field - of-use license agreement that grants Natural Science rights to Fermilab's electromagnetic boom and environmental cleanup technologies for use in conjunction with magnetizable oil. The Natural Science team is developing an elec tromagnetic mop system that may be able to extract over ninety percent of the oil from the surrounding water, a substantial gain over traditional methods. If the technology is successfully commercialized, it could become an industry standard for oil spill remediation. Impact Natural Science can use and develop electromagnetic oil recovery boom technologies across a broad range of applications, including on - and off -shore oil remediation and control management systems as well as produced water hydrocarbon remediation. Through this exclusive field -of-use agreement, Natural Science customers will now have access to innovative technology that is environmentally safe and outstrips current solutions in terms of efficiency. \"This license agreement, with one of the most recognized laboratories in the world, represents our commitment to finding the best technologies and delivering the best solutions to our customers ...

Innovation Coordinating with a CFD program from WindSim1, the INL team developed General Line Ampacity State Solver (G LASS)2, which offers the ability to blend data from weather monitors and electric utility system data with CFD -enhanced weather analysis algorithms. Outcomes Technology Advancement Since 2010, INL has collaborated with Idaho Power Company on dynamic line r ating concepts, and recently finished a full instrumentation of two test beds with weather stations and line rating software in Idaho. With GLASS , Idaho Power has been gathering weather data and the ability to calculate steady state, transient, and what IN L calls \"true dynamic liner rating\" ampacities .3 The next step is ramping up the software to calculate forecasted line ampacities and temperatures. INL also has completed a cooperative research and development agreement with AltaLink LLC \u2014Alberta, Canada's largest regulated electric transmission company \u2014on a field study of four transmission line segments in support of a wind project's expansion request .4 Impact In recognition of its potential to strengthen and secure the power grid, GLASS was named a finali st for the 2017 R&D 100 Awards. INL has also received a Technology Commercialization Fund award from the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Technology Transfer. In 2018 and 2019, INL plans to refine the GLASS software with another industry partner, testin g endurance and possibilities for commercialization. In its seven -year evolution, GLASS has undergone three formal peer reviews and two merit reviews. More than 70 people from around the world, representing the utility industry, academia, and local, state and federal government, came to Idaho Falls Nov. 7 -8 for an INL -hosted Dynamic Line Rating workshop. \"While WindSim was originally a software program designed to optimize placement and performance of wind turbines, the company's collaboration with INL has allowed the company to broaden their solutions.\" Catherine Meissner, Software Development Manager, WindSim Timeline 2010 : INL researchers worked with WindSim to start studying how transmission lines cooled by the wind can handle more electricity.

Innovation A nuclear industry task force led by INL human factors researcher Johanna Oxstrand is instrumental in ongoing efforts to leverage the efficiency and safety benefits of computer - based procedures and work processes.1 The industry task force is known as DIRECTOR - an acronym for \"Dynamic Instructions Editing Tool Requirements\". The DIRECTOR initiative is a follow - on to the \"Nuclear Electronic Work Packages - Enterprise Requirements\" task force led by Ms. Ox strand, 2015 -2017. The 110 participants in the DIRECTOR task force represent 19 utilities, 11 research organizations, and 16 vendors as well as multiple standards organizations. Outcomes Technology Advancement The strong industry engagement in both DIRECTOR and NEWPER mirrors an industry -wide attitude shift toward phasing out the use of paper -based work processes in favor of streamlined electronic processes. The main goal of the DIRECTOR and NEWPER initiative s is to define functional and design requirements for electronic work packages (eWP) and computer based procedure solutions, that each utility can use and tailor to their specific needs Impact NEWPER published a large set of utility -generic functional requirements for eWP solutions. These re quirements describe the fundamental functionality needed for all roles involved in the work management process, such as planners, supervisors, craft, and archiving staff. The final NEWPER functional requirements report for advanced and adaptive smart docum ents was published as a Procedure Professionals Association standard in 2017.2 \"NEWPER is a critical element of a fundamental shift within the nuclear industry away from paper.

Innovation In a joint development project with industry and academia1, Idaho National Laboratory's Energy Storage Group have developed the Impedance Measurement Box (IMB), a device that can generate battery impedance data in 10 to 15 seconds. Outcomes Technology Advancement As battery technology becomes more complex and user s' expectations become more pronounced, there is a pressing need for highly accurate assessment techniques that can give state -of-health readings in conditions approaching real time. Until now, embedded monitoring has relied on passive measurements of volt age, current and temperature, or on impedance methods that can take as long as 10 minutes. In addition to testing electric vehicle batteries, the IMB diagnostic tool can be used to test batteries for many uses including military, telecommunications and cri tical infrastructure. The latest development is a third -generation device, able to assess a 50-volt system, making it applicable for testing on battery modules. The overarching technological purpose of IMB is the development of smarter and better energy st orage and management systems that can more accurately detect pending failures, assist with warranty, and enable smarter management for extended battery life. Impact INL has teamed with Colorado based Dynexus Technology, Inc., to provide the energy storage industry with this first -of-a-kind technology for advanced battery health diagnostics. Under an exclusive licensing agreement, Dynexus will commercialize IMB as an embedded wideband impedance technology for analyzing and forecasting the health, aging and s afety characteristics of advanced energy storage devices2. \"This technology could help assess the resale value of a used electric vehicle, or provide remaining life and safety insights for repurposing those batteries into secondary applications.

Innovation As liquefied natural gas (LNG) advances toward widespread commercial use, the prospect of producing it where it will be distributed commercially has become increasingly attractive. An invention by the LNG research team at Idaho National Laboratory has made this prospect a reality by developing a small -scale methane liquefaction plant. Small -scale liquefaction plants are advantageous because their compact size enables the production of LNG close to the location where it will be used. Th is proximity decreases transpor tation and LNG product costs for consumers. Outcomes Technology Advancement The small -scale LNG plant also allows localized peak shaving to occur - balancing the availability of natural gas during high and low periods of demand. It also makes it possible for communities without access to natural gas pipelines to install local distribu tion systems to supply stored LNG. INL liquefaction technology is designed to draw natural gas from a transmission pipeline at a point where the pressure is dropped to accommodate commercial distribution. The plant is powered mainly by the energy created through this pressure drop. As the gas enters the plant, some of it is allowed to expand, and as it expands, it cools. This allows the process to use the natural gas as a coolant in the liquefaction process. Impact Texas based Nu Blu Energy, LLC exercised their option to license this liquefaction technology and the complementary liquid and compressed natural gas fueling system developed by researchers at INL. Nu Blu is moving ahead to finalize the design and engineering of these systems to enable commercial deployment at a location in Port Allen, LA. \"We are excited to bring the INL technology to LNG market. The NuBlu facility in Port Allen, Louisiana, is producing cold LNG for all energy markets. We are working to get all the LNG prescribed so we can duplicate our efforts to expand the plant to 90,000 gallons per day.\" Cory Duck , Vice President of Corporate Growt h & Development NuBlu Energy Timeline 2000: INL begins collaboration to build and demonstrate small scale LNG plant in Sacramento, CA 2002: First natural gas liquefaction facility commissioned in Sacramento, CA1 2005: C/LNG Fueling system developed at INL deployed in Fresno, CA 2006: INL small scale LNG technology wins R&D 100 Award 2015: INL LNG technologies licensed to Nu Blu Energy 1 eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2002 -06/dne -icg062002.php A liquid and compressed natural gas fueling station in Fresno, California.

Innovation One of first projects identified as a new priority by The Kansas City National Security Campus (KCNSC) is developing next generation radar. As general university collaborations proved successful, the concept evolved into a more strategic process for maturing technology and un iversity partnerships with the Radar 2021 Consortium. As part of their partnership w ith the University of Kansas, The KCNSC Radar Consortium recently investigated the snow and ice sheet thicknesses in the Arctic , Greenland, and the Antarctic by testing a KU/KCNSC radar flying over the North Pole. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) P -3 plane measured and charted the snow sheet thickness over 89.993\u00ba North at an altitude of 1,500 feet. Outcomes Technology Advancement Another university partner designed and fabricated a miniaturized agricultural radar that operates in the 22 - 26GHz range using a laminate substrate material as part of the Technology Demonstration Panel (TDP) philosophy that was created within this consortium . A second uni versity team designed and fabricated miniaturized additively manufactured (AM) electrical shields to achieve isolation between signal lines on this radar Impact This flight was a high -priority mission over sea ice and a repeat of a flight line surveyed yea rly since 2013 (Fig. 1). NASA was able to benefit from the greatly increased resolution (less than 2cm, Fig. 2) of the KU/KCNSC Radar, while the KCNSC was able to benefit from flight testing and learning more about the application of some of the newly -deve loped Radar Consortium technology such as miniaturization and increased power. The first iteration included a miniaturized RF section (~5x smaller), increased power (~10x increase), and stretched processing capability for long -range measurements (>12x airp lane altitude increase while maintaining high resolution of <2cm). \"Current and future work are geared toward the incorporation of novel packaging technologies developed within the Consortium to further increase performance while reducing the ins trument's size, weight, and power requirements.\" Fernando Rodriguez -Morales, Professor at KU \"Application of this techn ology to oil and gas 1 Morales, F.

One of the \"game changing\" technologies identified for expansion by the KSNSC is Polymer Additive Manufacturing (AM). Innovation One of the \"game changing\" technologies identified for expansion by the KSNSC is Polymer Additive Manufacturing (AM). KCNSC strategically selected specific university, laboratory, and industry partners for its Polymer AM Consortium because of the considerable amount of fundamental, basic, and applied research required. Polymer AM provides rapid development from concept to the manufacturing floor with a less expensive alternative to metals in certain circumstances. The KCNSC works with a myriad of polymeric materials that are used in tooling, fixtures, and war r eserve parts, and has the ability to rapidly scan objects and use Polymer AM to reproduce these objects on -site and on - demand. Typically referred to as Rapid Prototyping, this technique can be used very effectively to provide quick answers to evolving tech nical questions about processes or products. Outcomes Technology Advancement KCNSC's Polymer AM Consortium worked closely with university collaborators and a vendor to develop polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) powders with appropriate particle sizes for use in low-temperature Powder Bed Fusion (PBF, also known as Selective Laser Sintering - SLS) processing. These materials have great potential for use as encapsulant molds including, but not limite d to, potting shells, dams, and sealers. The rapid turn - around by the university collaborators to focus heavily on PPS processing and the relationship developed with the vendor has given the KCNSC an unprecedented ability to conduct R&D toward the developm ent and potential implementation of a science -based manufacturing approach using PBF that will allow high fidelity parts to be fabricated for future mission assignments. \"This Consortium, while highly focused on various aspects of Polymer AM, is also a conduit to rapidly enhance our knowledge and capabilities as a whole .\" Jamie Messman , Principle R&D Scientist and Polymer Additive Manufacturing Consortium Leader \"Application of this technology to oil and gas Scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of pillar microstructure of silicone elastomer printed using stereolithography, a polymer additive process.

Success Story from FY16 Published March 2019 energy.gov/technologytransitions Success Stories Moving Innovative Technologies from DOE National Laboratories to the Marketplace A Cancer Vaccine Delivery Technology Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory with support from NIH, DTRA, and industry partners A vehicle for drug delivery with broad applications. Innovation A team of scientists at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) has developed a technology that has a broad commercial potential as a vehicle for the delivery of drugs and vaccines and certain other applications. The technology is based on the use of synthetic nanometer -sized nanolipoprotein particles (NLPs) that mimic the naturally occurring high -density lipoprotein (HDL) particles in the blood, which are evolved for the transport of cholesterol and other lipid molecules in the body. Outcomes Technology Advancement In a personalized vaccine approach, a cocktail of synthetic versions of some of these peptides carrying new antigenic determinants can be used to vaccinate the patient to stimulate a powerful anti -cancer immune response. But, the delivery of synthetic peptides in free form is not very efficient party due to the degradation of peptides in the body. However, such peptides are protected from degradation in the body when they are embedded on the surface of LLNL -developed NLPs. Moreover, adjuvants required for inducing a strong immune response to destroy cancer cells can also be conjugated on the surface of NLPs carry ing peptides. Thus, the use of NLPs enables the co -delivery of peptides and adjuvants to lymph nodes at the same time and in a particulate form for optimum anti -cancer immune response. Impact The NLP technology has been licensed to Ann Arbor, Michigan - base d startup company, EVOQ Therapeutics, for development of a peptide -based human cancer vaccine. EVOQ hopes to start clinical trials using this approach within two to three years. The NLP technology has many additional applications including the development of vaccines for Francisella tularensis (rabbit fever), influenza and Chlamydia; the in vivo delivery of nucleic acids; formulating drug molecules to enhance their efficacy; and the shuttling of therapeutics across the blood -brain barrier. \"I saw [the development of NLPs] as an important advance for understanding the mechanics of drug transport into cells and potentially as a platform for the development and delivery of vaccines. Without the support of the LDRD Program, the NLPs wouldn't be where they are today.\" Paul Hoeprich Bio-organic Chemist and one of the original inventors of NLPs, LLNL Timeline 2005: NLP technology development begins at LLNL with internal LDRD funding. 2014: First patent, in e xtensive intellectual property portfolio, issued . 2017: EVOQ Therapeutics licenses LLNL intellectual property. as cation of this technology to oil and gas A concept of personalized cancer vaccine Success Story from FY17 Published March 2019 energy.gov/technologytransitions Success Stories Moving Innovative Technologies from DOE National Laboratories to the Marketplace ALE3D for Industry (ALE3D4I): Multiphysics Simulations for Advanced Manufacturing Solutions Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Software code that simulates process used in advanced manufacturing made available to industry. Innovation For over 30 years, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) developed and utilized ALE3D - a unique finite element based, multi -physics software code that simulates processes commonly used in today's Advanced Manufacturing processes. Until recently, ALE3D has only been available for U.S. Government use. LLNL has recently introduced a version of ALE3D modified for industrial use by leveraging internal development funding (LLNL's Innovation Development Fund). The new ALE3D For Industry (ALE3D4I) can now be used on LLNL's HPC systems with non -Governmental U.S. pa rtners to develop solutions to industry's Advanced Manufacturing problems. Outcomes Technology Advancement ALE3D4I, like its parent Government -only software ALE3D, enables simulating several key processes used in Advanced Manufacturing. Through previous Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs) with industrial partners, LLNL has used ALE3D to simulate production processes for manufacturing metal parts via laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing - a field that is growing exponentially . Transitioning metal additive manufacturing from production of prototypes to production of critical parts (like those used in safety -critical systems in automobiles and airplanes) is hindered by a lack of confid ence in the quality of the part . Published studies based on the ALE3D code demonstrate the importance of recoil pressure and Marangoni convection in shaping the melt pool flow and how denudation, spattering, and pore defects emerge and become part of a laser bed -fusion process. Now with ALE3D4I, manufacturers interested in using this additive manufacturing process to produce critical parts can simulate their manufacturing process and better understand the effect on their product before they spend significant manufacturing resources and time. \"U.S. industry is looking for a competitive edge by leveraging HPC...We're confident that ALE3D -4I is going to fill a need that the engineering software industry can't currently provide.\" Chad Noble, ALE3D Team Lead, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Timeline 1990s: LLNL begins publishing research papers on ALE3D 2016: LLNL funds internal development of ALE3D4i to make an industry -usable version of its national security code ALE3D 2017: LLNL launches ALE3D4i for industrial use Simulation of laser based additive manufacturing (AM) on the powder scale to determine spattering associated with the AM process.

Innovation Over the past six years, through a CRADA and license, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and EmiSense Technologies, LLC developed and commercialized LLNL's novel NOx sensing technology. Existing sensors are both expensive and fragile, limiting adoption in applications looking to keep costs down. The combination of smart electronics and simplified ceramics results in a more sensitive and durable sensor that is easier and more cost effective to produce. Outcomes Technology Advancement The sensor is comprised of a rugged probe designed to survive the harsh environment of an exhaust pipe, connected to a sensor -control module, which performs the signal processing and enables signal extraction. A novel measurement principle sometimes referred to as multi -wave time differential sensing, simplifies the ceramic sensing element contained in the probe, uses impedance spectroscopy to simultaneously differentiate various gas species, inclu ding NO, NO 2, and O 2. The technology fit was good for Emi Sense, which develops commercially -viable advanced automotive sensors from laboratory -scale technologies by developing and validating material sets, designing circuits, selecting components that are cost -effective and approved for automotive applications, and by coding embedded software that delivers selectivity, accuracy, and robust self -diagnostics. Impact Over time, the solid -state NOx sensor may become as inexpensive as $50 per unit, lowering many of the biggest barriers to adoption in new vehicles, stationary eng ines, generators, port equipment, and combined heat and power systems. Such advantages open the door to a projected $2.5 billion -dollar industry by 2023, as regulation of diesel engines expands to light passenger vehicles, commercial and marine vehicles, l ocomotives, and construction and mining equipment. aboratories Timeline 1999: Scientists at LLNL start working on NOx detection 2009: EmiSense was formed 2011: EmiSense executed an exclusive license agreement for the LLNL NOx sen sor portfolio, followed with a 30 month CRADA Prototype NOx sensor cross section Success Story from FY17 Published March 2019 energy.gov/technologytransitions Success Stories Moving Innovative Technologies from DOE National Laboratories to the Marketplace Revolutionary Suppressor for U.S. Soldiers and Law Enforcement Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory The first -ever practical suppressor for single -shot and automatic weapons on the battlefield Innovation Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) developed a revolutionary technology that upends the previous century of firearm suppressor design. The key feature of the technology is a flow -through design that simultaneously limits blowback, flash, noise, and temperature, lasting the lifetime of the barrel on single -shot and fully automatic weapons. In addition, the flow -through design requi res only minimal maintenance. These features result in the first practical suppressor for battlefield use. Outcomes Technology Advancement Developed in partnership with the U.S. military, this novel suppressor design simultaneously limits weapon blowback, flash, noise and temperature to a degree previously thought impossible by leading manufacturers. With these benefits, the suppressor will also help reduce one of the most prevalent injuries to the modern warfighter: long -term hearing loss.

The HPC4Mfg project aimed to better understand the material properties of metal objects made using additive manufacturing technology. The joint research team simulated the crystal structure of metals grown during the melting and freezi ng processes that metal powders experience as they are added layer by layer to the part being built. Material properties can be derived from knowledge of the crystal structure. The team focused on a nickel -iron-niobium alloy, an approximation for the IN 7 18 alloy used in the aerospace industry. Outcomes Technology Advancement The project utilized parallel phase -fields codes at ORNL and LLNL, along with the high -performance computing (HPC) capabilities existing at the two labs to demonstrate the simulation of multiple dendrite gr owth in three -dimensions (3 - D). The computational results were compared with experimental results obtained through work at UTRC. Impact The project is the first step towards the full 3 -D implementation of the integrated m icrostructural modeling framework for AM envisioned by UTRC.

Innovation Using commercial and state -of-the-art research codes, LLNL researchers identified the major sources of turbulence production in ZoomEssence dryers and characterized the turbulence intensity throughout the dryer. LLNL researchers chose two separate methodologies to simulate the drying physic s in the ZoomEssence system. This work provides a direct characterization of the impact of t urbulence on drying and provided guidelines for increase the impact of turbulence on drying rates. Outcomes Technology Advancement ZoomEssence developed the DriZoom spray drying technology, which uses less energy and results in a higher quality product than traditional spray drying. However, the optimal design of this new method relies on a deep understanding of the fluid dynamics and thermodynamics of the drying process that is not captured by the currently available analysis methods. Advanced CFD codes which can accurately model both major flow structures simultaneously with fine turbulence structure were used to diagnose the flow conditions in the dryer. Researchers found that turbulence aids in mixing the fluid, and that if it is increased further, it could greatly enhance particle drying. The results from the commercial and research turbulence simulations were consistent with these results. Further, in low turbulence environments, the lower fidelity simulations provide an effective tool for studying th e particle drying dynamics. Impact A very conservative estimated reduction of the energy requirements which could be achieved by this study through implementation of turbulent mixing with no -heat spray drying reduces the energy required to evaporate a ton of water from 4.8 GJ/ton to ~240MJ/ton of evaporated water energy savings per spray dryer. This gives an estimated domestic energy savings on the order of 114,000 GJ just in spray dried food products. \"Research partners can use these high - performance computing systems to work on modeling, simulating, and analyzing cutting - edge industrial products and processes, giving them a resource that no internat ional competitor can match.\" Mark Johnson, Director, DOE's Advanced Manufacturing Office, speaking about the HPC4Mfg Program in a 2016 published i nterview Timeline 2015: DOE announces the new High Performance Computing for Manufacturing (HPC4Mfg) Program. 2016: The HPC4Mfg program announces 10 new projects, including the collaborative research partnership between LLNL and Zoomessence, Inc. 2017: LLNL and Zoomessence complete work under the Cooperative Research and Development (CRADA) agreement; the publi shed poster summarizing the project shows tangible benefits, including \" Design guidance at costs of ~$100Ks as opposed to pilot plants running costs of ~$10M .\" HPC modeling and simulation shows the turbulent kine tic energy in the flow of an industrial scale drier.

Innovation An ongoing research effort at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) could lead to a cleaner method to transform acrylonitrile (ACN) into carbon fiber, replacing petrochemicals with biomass as the starting point . They did this using nitrilation, a renewable alternative to the petrochemical method which eliminates toxic byproducts, requires less energy, uses inexpensive catalysts, and can be performed in a simple reactor configuration with no explosion hazards. Outcomes Technology Advancement NREL mana ged to successfully produce 50 grams of bio -derived ACN in a reactor similar to those used in industry today. That capped the first phase of the program. The second phase, now under way, calls for the production of 50 kilograms of ACN that will be converte d into carbon fiber and tested. Impact Driven in part by the interest in using carbon fiber for lightweighting vehicles and aircraft that will save money on fuel costs, the demand for carbon fibers is projected to increase 11% to 18% annually. And given th at the carbon fiber industry is especially sensitive to price fluctuations in their base chemical ACN (it takes roughly 2 pounds of ACN to generate 1 pound of carbon fiber), there is a clear need to develop alternative cost - competitive processes. NREL esti mates the new process could put the selling price of biomass -derived ACN below $1 per pound from cellulosic biomass or starch -based sugars. This target was deemed necessary for cost competitiveness with conventionally prod uced acrylonitrile. The process produced a 98% yield of ACN.

Success Story from FY1 6 Published March 2019 energy.gov/technologytransitions Success Stories Moving Innovative Technologies from DOE National Laboratories to the Marketplace Geometrically Enhanced Photocathodes for Improved High -Efficiency in X -Ray Detectors Nevada National Security Site New photocathode technology that may revitalize the U.S. capability to manufacture imaging dete ctor systems for critical national security applications. Innovation Researchers at the Nevada National Security Site funded through the Site -Directed Research and Development Program (SDRD) have conceived a way to break the limits of detector efficiency and performance in the soft x -ray range, which is largely limited by the total quantum electron yield. Most x -ray detectors operate at normal incidence (i.e., x -ray photons are at a 90\u00b0 incid ence angle to the photocathode) and suffer a loss in quantum efficiency at energies greater than 5 keV. But improvements in yield of up to 20 times have occurred with grazing incidence geometry due to the larger path length of the x-ray photons, which bett er matches the secondary elec tron escape depth within the ph otocathode material. Outcomes Technology Advancement The cathode in the SDRD design can be as large as 5 -8 inches in diameter, is free standing, and can be coated with any coating (i.e., Au, CsI, KBr). Also, the cathode can be used at photon energies below 1 keV, with even greater improvement in signal. This design is adaptable to any x -ray detector, allowing for ease of use without compromising performance parameters such as spatial and temporal resolution. The geometrically enhanced photocathode also increases the measured total electron yield by up to 3 times in the 1 -12 keV energy range. Impact This technology addresses a problem that exists in the stagnating photomultiplier tube (PMT) industr y, which is no longer developing the PMTs that were commonplace in legacy testing days. This R&D has spawned more research in semiconductor -based photocathodes and high -density microchannel designs for developing more efficient high -speed imaging systems. \"The geometrically enhanced photocathode proves that we can push the limits on what we can do in quantum efficiency - that is, improve our ability to see finer detail in the dynamics of fusion experiments. With this geometrically enhanced photocathode, we're getting better and more data, and it lets us view the dynamics of fusion more clearly.\" Howard Bender, Distinguished Scientist NNSS Los Alamos Operations Timeline 2014: Feasibility study completed under Site - Directed Research and Development 2016 : Demonstration of first use in streak camera 2017: Received R&D 100 award Recessed cone and pyramid structures were considered. Full -length and shallow structures are shown. It was determined that the pyramid structures were more efficient and easier to fabricate; therefore, full-scale and shallow recessed pyramids were made, characterized, and tested in a National Ignition Facility streak camera, SPIDER. Results show an increase in electron yield of up to 3.5x in 7.5 keV.

Improving the ability to detect and identify radioactive sources in order to use unmanned aerial vehicles to measure radioactivity. Innovation The NNSS Remote Sensing Laboratory (RSL) relies upon state - of-the-art sensors to detect, measure and identify radioactive sources. As part of the research and development efforts, scientists and engineers from the NNSS integrated the H3D sensors with unma nned aerial systems, creating a more flexible and agile vehicle for measuring radiation. Outcomes Technology Advancement The first tests were completed in September 2017 at the Unmanned Systems Inc. (USI) facility in Columbia Falls, Montana and data analys is was finalized in December 2017. The first test provided excellent results that will be used to refine further flights. The CRADA allows NNSS to leverage commercialized radiation detectors and UAS technology, enabling it to deploy them in an entirely ne w way; the new methods are a new asset for responding to nuclear emergency situations. Impact H3D's technology grew out of research conducted at the Nuclear Engineering department at the University of Michigan. The technology was further funded in large part by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA). The ongoing partnership between H3D and the NNSS will provide research into the trade -offs between sensitivity and resolution of the compact radiation detectors. Integrating the sensor technology with unmanned aerial vehicles has the potential to enhance the next -generation radiation detection capabilities for RSL and other emergency response agencies. \"H3D views aerial radiation detection platforms as a key growth area for our organ ization and we are fortunate to have NNSS as a partner in this effort.\" Willy Kaye , Founder and CEO, H3D, Inc.

Innovation The BES C research team showed that a key gene can reduce lignin content in plant cells by up to 50 percent in poplar (Populus trichocarpa) and plants carrying this variant of the lignin -producing gene showed an increase in sugar release of up to 280 percent. This increase in sugar release resulted in a 250 percent increase in ethanol yield from the biomass that was not chemically or mechanically pretreated. Outcomes Technology Advancement ORNL researchers also applied the same gene altering method used on poplar trees to Medicago truncatula, a model system used for alfalfa, which is widely used for animal feed. This resulted in a 25 percent reduction in lignin and a 250 percent increase in flavonoid content. Industry believes this innovation could have a dramatic impact on forage crops by reducing the lignin barrier for improved digestibility while also improving the nutritional quality with increased flavonoids. Impact ORNL continues to collaborate with both GreenWood Resources and Forage Genetics International as the companies conduct field studies over the next few years to validate this novel plant system in the co mpanies' commercial varieties. ORNL's Technology Innovation Program (TIP) support efforts at ORNL to collaborate with each company during their field trials to provide an accelerated timeline to develop this innovation for the marketplace. \"Incorporating this technology into GreenWood's poplar breeding program will lead to a new, superior class of bioenergy plantation varieties with which biorefineries can produce transportation fuels at a reduced cost, owing to significant savings during th e pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis stages.

Innovation Hyperion is a cyber security technology that can alert a user to the existence of sleeper code embedded within executable compu ter files to thwart malicious activity. Outcomes Technology Advancement Hyperion's earliest foundations can be traced to work at IBM in the 1990s in functional and denotational semantics followed by additional work in function extraction at Carnegie Mellon University's Software Engineering Institute in 2004. But it was the vision of ORNL researchers who identified the key technical advances that enabled them to take the nascent technology to a deployable form. Work began at ORNL in 2010 on improvements in core algorithms for performance, better semantic handling, and better maintainability, which resulted in today's Hyperion. Impact From a cyber security perspective, it is advantageous to understand and analyze the functionality of binary executables of ne wly developed software or acquired software prior to installing and running these programs on a computer. This is very difficult to do. The Hyperion system was designed to 'look inside' an executable program and determine software's function or 'behavior ' without the use of the software's source code. These behaviors can be automatically checked for known malicious signatures and inspected by domain experts to assure correct operation and the absence of malicious content. The closest commercial products s tart from the perspective of \"presumed innocent\" code, whereas Hyperion treats all code as a suspect. \"For us, software with unknown behavior has unknown security, which is problematic for global cybersecurity. Current methods are increasingly overwhelmed by the sophistication of attacks often precipitated by stealthy zero -day or sleeper code vulnerabilit ies. With Hyperion, we're offering a new class of cyber protection.\" B.K.

Innovation Researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) have developed a high -performance lignin -based thermoplastic that will be useful for industrial plastic resins and commercial materials. The thermoplastic product is an unmodified solvent - extracted melt -stable lignin combined with non -lignin thermoplastic polymer segments. Named ABL, the new material is a drop -in replacement for ABS, providing both performance and cost benefits. Outcomes Technology Advancement To accelerate commercial deployment, ORNL invested a portion of its royalty funds to mature this technology under its Technology Innovation Program (TIP). Under TIP, researchers worked to make the technology more commercially ready while technology transfer office staff members conducted an aggressive outreach campaign.

An ORNL developed method to produce quantum light in more controlled deterministic matter which can improve the speed and security of sharing encrypted data. Innovation Systems that emit single photons typically do so at random times, and it is difficult to generate them as needed, or deterministically. The ORNL team turned to a method known as down -conversion, a process in that yields not one, but two photons. The detection of one of these photons \"heralds\" the presence of the other. Arranging many photon sources together increases the probability of generating at least one photon pair when needed, even though the individual sources emit at random. This method was licensed t o Qubitekk Inc. Outcomes Technology Advancement To keep from losing the photon pairs, the team built upon existing ideas of multiplexing, an approach that uses a series of light source systems comprising components common in fiber - optics. The systems switch the speed and frequency of the heralded photon. ORNL's innovation carries out the switching in the frequency domain that potentially reduces significant single -photon loss. \"The goal is to specify and control every aspect of the photon's quantum st ate, constraining everything to a single mode so that the photons emitted from the single - photon source are identical - each one indistinguishable from the next,\" ORNL co -inventor Nicholas Peters said. The identical photon pairs can be used in developing q uantum key encryption technologies that protect information from cyber threats when shared over existing machine -to-machine networks. Impact Qubitekk has been developing and commercializing quantum cryptography solutions based on its compact and robust entangled photon sources since 2012. The company has focused specifically on the development of quantum key distribution (QKD) systems for machine -to-machine communications associated with distributed control. \"The idea of a nearly on -demand, single - photon source can be used to increase the speed, or data rates, and the distance you can send the quantum keys when transmitting encrypted information \" Duncan Earl , President and CTO, Qubitekk Timeline 2012: Qubitekk starts developing commercializing quantum 2017: Qubitekk partnered with ORNL under a CRADA to collaborate a related project (Scalable Quantum Cryptography Network for Protected Automation Commu nication ) funded by the Cybersecurity of Energy Delivery Systems Program. 1 UTB ID 201603700, Deterministic Single Photon Source based on Spectral Shift of a Herald Photon, U.S. Patent Applications 15/829,349 filed December 1, quantum encryption technology Success Story from FY17 Published March 2019 energy.gov/technologytransitions Success Stories Moving Innovative Technologies from DOE National Laboratories to the Marketplace Cerium Alu minum (Ce -Al) Alloys Provide an Improved Material for Casting Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in conjunction with Ames Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and Eck Industries A new Ce-Al alloy with multiple beneficial characteristics that allow it to fulfill multiple applications.

These characteristics make this alloy ideal for automotive, aerospace, power generation, and other applications. Outcomes Technology Advancement This team has shown that this Ce -Al alloy is stable at a temperature of 500 \u00b0C. This high temperature material can be incorporated into engines to allow the engine to run hotter for a more complete fuel combustion while being lighter in weight for better fuel efficiency. This alloy also offers improved production methods by not requiring additional thermal processing during the casting process and uses standard aluminum foundry practices w ithout a protective atmosphere. Avoiding the thermal processing and the resulting machining to address thermal distortion will save up to 50 -60% of the cost of casting traditional alloys. Impact Eck Industries sees tremendous interested from their existing and potential customers due to the unique material properties of this low -cost alloy. With this alloy making use of cerium, the U.S. manufacturing sector will benefit from low production costs and suppliers in the U.S. domestic rare earth mining operations will have a new commercial opportunity f or an element that make up as much as half of the mined rare earths. \"There has been tremendous interest from industry due to the unique material properties and low cost o f this alloy.

But, instead of using sugars and yeast to make alcohol, waste carbon -rich gases \u2014such as those found at industrial manufa cturing sites \u2014are converted by bacteria to fuels and chemicals, like ethanol. The ethanol can be used for a range of low carbon products, including alcohol -to-jet synthetic paraffinic kerosene (ATJ -SPK), which now is eligible to be used in commercial fligh ts at up to 50 percent blends with conventional jet fuel. Outcomes Technology Advancement LanzaTech turned to the catalytic expertise of PNNL, which developed a unique catalytic process and proprietary catalyst to upgrade the ethanol to (ATJ -SPK). PNNL's catalyst removes oxygen from the ethanol in the form of water, and then combines the remaining hydrocarbon molecules to form chains large enough for jet fuel without forming aromatics that lead to soot when burned. Impact After PNNL produced five gallons o f the desired fuel, LanzaTech then scaled up the entire process. The ethanol was converted to 4,000 gallons of ATJ -SPK at LanzaTech's Freedom Pines facility in Georgia and met all the specifications required for use in commercial aviation. In April 2018, a n international standards body approved the ethanol -to-jet fuel pathway for aviation turbine fuel at up to a 50 percent blend ratio with standard, petroleum -based jet fuel based on LanzaTech's Research Report \u2014the culmination of a multi -year collaboration with PNNL.

Innovation Using PNNL's electrolyte chemistry, the vanadium redox flow battery can store 70% more energy and operate over a wider temperature range than similar batteries, making it much more efficient and cost -effective. The inventors at PNNL were so excited about t he potential of the new battery that they formed a startup company to commercialize it. UniEnergy Technologies (UET), near Seattle, Washington, was launched in 2012 with a technology license from PNNL. With private funding, the company began building a 60, 000-square -foot manufacturing facility to make the battery systems, which are housed in portable shipping containers. Outcomes Technology Advancement As energy distributors and users realized the value of UET's battery, the company began attracting collab orators. In 2014, Washington State's Clean Energy Fund awarded $10.5 million in matching grants to two utilities to lead energy storage projects featuring UET's battery. This built on other grid modernization initiatives, including DOE's Pacific Northwest Smart Grid Demonstration Project and Smart Grid Investment Grant funding. Impact As of 2016, UET had almost 20MW/80MWh of energy storage systems deployed, ordered, or awarded in the utility, micro grid, and commercial and industrial sectors. In addition to bolstering the nation's energy system, UET has also attracted $25 million in private investments to make, demonstrate, and sell its batteries and created 50 jobs. \"Our partnership with PNNL has been critical in successfully pioneering a new generation of vanadium redox flow batteries from basic chemistry developed at the Lab to field deployment of multi -MW systems in the fast growing, grid storage market.

This new imaging apparatus will make significant contributions to EUV lithography at wavelengths in the range from 10 to 15 nm, which is presently being developed for the manufacturing of the next -generation of computer processors and other semi -conductor integrated circuits. Outcomes Technology Advancement EUV lithography uses reflectors to diffract EUV light off a mas k that has an image of the information that will be imprinted on the chip. But, current EUV lithography technology, which is still being developed, can only do this by scanning a tiny piece of the image onto the chip at once. The new invention uses a multi -layered structure to reflect the EUV beams to produce a wider beam of light. This captures all the information on the mask and imprints it onto the computer chip without the need for scanning. The new EUV imaging apparatus is expected to lead to substanti al advancements and cost savings in the manufacturing process. Impact The optimization of EUV lithography for the manufacture of the next -generation integrated circuits is a subject of intense research in industry and laboratories worldwide. The new EUV imaging apparatus is considered the next generation of computer chip manufacturing because the EUV light, called soft X-rays, allows designers of computer chips to place 100 times more components, like transistors, in the same area of tiny computer chips. A nd, the linear distance between components is also 10 times shorter, which means the speed of the chip could be 10 times faster.

Compared to conventional methods, which are very expensive and time -consuming, this production technique allows for rapid, cost -efficient construction of new wind blade designs , reducing the production of custom molds from 16 months to just three. Outcomes Technology Advancement 3D printing, or additive manufacturing, is drastically reducing the time and cost associated with building new wind blade designs. It allows blade designs to move directly from computer models to mold production, bypassing some of the expensive and time -consuming steps of more traditional manufacturing. By streamlining the mold -making process, advanced designs can be tested more quickly, accelerating the introduction of new technology and leading to lowered costs for wind energy. Impact The prot otype blades that were printed by ORNL and assembled by TPI Composites are being flown by Sandia at the Scaled Wind Farm Technology (SWiFT) facility as part of an effort to conduct basic science research on wind plant performance. Additionally, this first test of using additive manufacturing is being analyzed by ORNL. With more large 3D printers becoming available in the marketplace, TPI Composites is deciding if 3D printing could be feasible not only for producing molds for subscale blade prototypes, but a lso for larger scale blade manufacturing. \"Working with Sandia has been a great experience.

Innovation SRNL's Porous Walled Hollow Glass Microspheres were originally developed as part of an improved system for hydrogen isotope separations in tritium production applications. Hollow glass microspheres have been used for years in lightweight filler material, insulation, abrasives and other applications. The SRNL -developed microspheres are unique because of a network of interconnected pores in the microsphere walls, which allo w the tiny microspheres to be filled with, hold and release gases and other materials. Because the glass microspheres provide a protective environment, or cocoon, for their contents, they can be used to hold reactive or flammable absorbents or stored mate rials, including solids, liquids or gases. This has the potential to provide a safe method of handling, storing or delivering a variety of materials. The microspheres also have an application as part of security inks for anti -counterfeiting purposes. Outc omes Technology Advancement A modified version of the microspheres could be used to deliver medication on target, releasing the drug at will and on a schedule. SpheroFill, a biomedical startup, will initially focus on developing microsphere -based treatment s for voice disorders in older individuals and as tissue filler for cosmetic surgery. The company also plans to develop the technology for muscle and bone repair for military use. Impact The long -term goal involves cancer treatment.

Innovation An energy -saving technology called the \"Ganni Cycle\" has been developed at Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility for application to cryogenic refrigeration systems. The Ganni Cycle (named after a cryogenic expert at Jefferson Lab) has been proven to reduce energy consumption for cryogenic refrigeration systems by 20 to 45 percent. Since these systems tend to be very energy intensive, the resulting cost savings are substantial. Outcomes Technology Advancement The portions of the Ganni Cycle that can be used for existing systems have slashed the power requirements of Jefferson Lab's refrig eration system, while still meeting the Lab's needs. The cycle has dropped the electricity consumption of the Lab's cryogenic systems from 6 Megawatts (MW) to 4.2 MW, resulting in a direct savings of $33,000 each month in electricity costs with cost saving s likely to become even more significant in the future. In addition to energy use reductions and energy costs savings, the Ganni Cycle has the added benefit of reducing maintenance costs, nearly doubling the lifetime of some refrigerator components (a comp ressor increases its life from 45,000 hours to 74,000 hours) and increasing the time between necessary maintenance periods. Impact Already, the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory and the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS ) at Oak Ridge National Lab have both benefited from this innovation and now other facilities are expressing an interest in implementing the process in their cryogenic systems. In addition, this technology was utilized by NASA for testing of the James Web b Space Telescope at conditions it will face in space. Jefferson Lab also successfully licensed this technology to Linde. \"The Jefferson Lab technology saves energy and was inexpensive to implement...The Ganni system increases plant capacity very efficiently when we need it and decreases it when we don't need it, all automatically...\"1 Roberto Than, head of cryogenics for the Collider -Acceler ator Department, BNL Timeline 2007: Patent Application Granted 2007: Received White House Closing the Circle Award \" for efforts that resulted in significant contribution to, or have made a significant positive impact regarding environmental stewardship .\" 2008: Linde BOC Process Plants technology incorp electric costs1 2012: Ganni -cycle based system for NASA space chamber used to test components for the James Webb Space Telescope undergoes successful test 1 goo.gl/9MK9H2 2 goo.gl/TV8mCW Jefferson Lab's Ganni Cycle Cryogenic technology was instrumental in the testing of NASA's James Webb Telescope. Success Story from FY17 Published March 2019 energy.gov/technologytransitions Success Stories Moving Innovative Technologies from DOE National Laboratories to the Marketplace Nuclear Physics Detector Technology is Powerful Tool in Fight Against Breast Cancer Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility in conjunction with Dilon Technologies Non-invasive imaging device for detecting breast cancers Innovation Known as Molecular Breast Imaging (MBI) or Breast Specific Gamma Imaging (BSGI) , the tool is based on gamma -imaging technology developed at the U.S. Department of Energy's Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility in Newport News, VA. MBI is a non -invasive breast imaging procedure that captures the cellular function of breast ti ssue, complementing mammography in helping to resolve difficult -to-interpret cases. Outcomes Technology Advancement MBI is designed for situations where mammography is inconclusive and further evaluation is needed, especially when patients have dense breast tissue, implants, multiple suspicious lesions or clusters of microcalcifications, palpable lesions not detected by ma mmography or ultrasound, post -surgical or post -therapeutic mass, or if they have been taking hormone replacement therapy. MBI relies on the advanced imaging technology of anatomic -specific detectors to detect early -stage cancers. The compact detector devel oped by Jefferson Lab captures vital tumor information by viewing the metabolism of cancerous lesions in the breast via radiopharmaceutical uptake. Impact Dilon Technologies, licensed the high -resolution gamma imaging technology from Jefferson Lab and used it to develop a compact dedicated breast imaging camera. Molecular Breast Imaging is saving lives. Using MBI as an adjunct to mammography results in an almost fourfold increase in invasive cancer detection in women with dense breast tissue. MBI has a high er specificity than MRI and has proven to reduce benign biopsies by 50%. With a negative predictive value of 98% , MBI is the beacon in dense breast tissue. More than 250,000 patients have been screened with BSGI/MBI on a worldwide basis. \"We have been able to make a significant impact by utilizing our licensing agreement with Jefferson Lab to help save lives...More than 250,000 patients have been screened with BSGI/MBI on a worldwide basis.\"1 Bob Moussa President and CEO, Dilon Timeline 1997: Jefferson Lab's nuclear imaging technology was licensed by 2 local businessmen, who formed Dilon Technologies 2004: Dilon 6800, first production unit for breast -specific gamma imaging sold 2009: Technology recognized with an FLC Technology Transfer Award 2011: Dilon Technologies recognized by DOE as a Top National 1 itnonline.com/content/department feder allabs.org/node/144254?tab=successes MBI provides a valuable tool in breast cancer detection, particularly in dense breast tissue. Success Story from FY17 Published March 2019 energy.gov/technologytransitions Success Stories Moving Innovative Technologies from DOE National Laboratories to the Marketplace Nuclear Physics Accelerator Technology Yields New Process for Producing Boron - Nitride Nanotubes Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility supported by DOE, Office of Naval Research, and the Commonwealth of Virginia, in conjunction with NASA Langley Research Center and the National Institute of Aerospace Process to fabricate high -quality boron -nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) Innovation Scientists have capitalized on the core technology that powers the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) to develop and license a process to fabricate high -quality nanotubes from boron nitride. These BNNTs maintain their strength in air to high temperatures (900\u00b0C), efficiently conduct heat but not electricity, can be made to be long and thin, are thought to be non -toxic to living tissues, and may be added to other materials to make composites with enhanced properties. Outcomes Technology Advancement Like carbon nanotubes, boron -nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) are composed of a sheet of atoms that are a single layer thick and are curled up into a tube. These tubes may be composed of one, two, or more rolled sheets of atoms of interlinked boron and nitrogen, with each sheet referred to as a \"wall.\" In 2009, researchers developed a now -patented process to synthesize high -quality BNNTs. Impact Boron -nitride nanotubes are being explored for their potential in a wide ra nge of scientific, industrial, and commercial applications, such as in composites for unmanned aerial vehicles, efficient solar panel arrays, tough coatings, long - lasting batteries, bright LEDs, effective radiation shielding, neutron detection and rugged a erospace components. The material is also being considered for use in many biomedical applications, such as scaffolding for nerve and bone tissue regeneration, targeted drug delivery, and cancer treatments. \"The current world supply of Fibril BNNT is under 10 grams, less than the weight of four pennies, but the demand for this material is tremendous. We believe we can sell as much as we can make. When I visit a lab or company, the final question is always \u2014 when can we have some?\"1 Mike Smith Chief Scientist, BNNT LLC Timeline 1994: Researchers affiliated with DOE's Berkeley Lab theorized that it should be possible to produce nanotubes from a white material called boron nitride 1995: BNNTs were first produced at Berkeley Lab 2009: Researchers developed a now -patented process to synthesize high -quality BNNTs at DOE's Jefferson Lab 2010: Patents for the material develo ped at Jefferson Lab licensed to a small start - up company, BNNT, LLC 2017: BNNT was n amed NASA Invention of the Year Boron Nitride Nanotubes offer game - changing pr operties for applications from biomedical to advanced composites to radiation shielding.
