Children 5 to 11 years old in Ontario are now eligible for a booster dose of a COVID-19 vaccine 6 months after their primary series. Appointments at Ottawa Public Health clinics can be booked via [the provincial booking system](https://covid-19.ontario.ca/book-vaccine/). |New - What information is available on the Pfizer vaccine for children six months to four years?| | | Health Canada has approved the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (3mcg) for children six months to four years of age. The vaccine is a 3-dose primary series. The recommended interval between doses is two months (56 days) between dose one and two, and two months (56 days) between dose two and three. For children who start their primary series with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 (3 mcg dose), they must also get a Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 product for their second and third doses. There is no mixing of COVID-19 vaccine products from different manufacturers for children six months to five years; however, if a child turns five and has not completed the series, they will be provided with the higher dose product appropriate for their age. On December 9, 2022, NACI updated their guidance now recommending that COVID-19 vaccines may be given on the same day as or at any time before or after non-COVID-19 vaccines for children 6 months to 5 years of age. |Why should my 6 months to 5-year-old get the COVID-19 vaccine?| | | Vaccination is the best and safest way to give an extra layer of protection for all children, including those aged six months to under five years. Not all children have only mild symptoms when they are sick with COVID-19. Even if your child has been infected with COVID-19, they should still be vaccinated. Studies in adults show that vaccination following infection provides stronger and longer-lasting protection. Vaccination is one of the best ways for individuals to protect themselves, their families and their communities against severe outcomes from COVID-19. |I have questions about the COVID-19 vaccine for my child. Who can I talk to?| | | The SickKids COVID-19 Vaccine Consult Service is a by-appointment phone service that provides a safe, judgment-free space to have an open conversation about the COVID-19 vaccine. |Learn more about Ottawa Public Health's plan to offer COVID-19 vaccines to children ages six months to 11 years old| | | For children aged six months to under five years, OPH recommends a vaccine appointment, to make sure the proper dose is available. Getting your vaccination will give you greater protection against serious illness and hospitalization from COVID-19. There are two different mRNA vaccines available to children six months of age and older. The vaccine your child gets will depend on availability and supply. Children aged six months to four years may be offered the Pfizer BioNTech 3mcg COVID-19 vaccine. This vaccine is a 3-dose primary series. Each dose is given at least two months (56 days) apart. Children aged six months to four years may be offered the Moderna Spikevax (25 microgram [mcg]) dose. This is a 2-dose primary series. Each dose is given 2 months (56 days) apart. Children aged five to 11 years of age will be offered the 10-mcg dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to start their vaccine series. Children who started a Moderna Spikevax 25 mcg vaccine series will generally complete the primary series with a second Moderna Spikevax dose. The Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty 10 mcg vaccine can be considered interchangeable with Moderna Spikevax 25 mcg to complete a primary series if it is authorized in the child's age group (i.e., age five to 11 years old). This means, that is safe for a child to start their series with a Moderna Spikevax dose and finish their series with a Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty dose. Children aged five to 11 years: Per the Ministry of Health, the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine 10-mcg dose is preferred to start the primary series in children this age over the Moderna (Spikevax) vaccine. This recommendation from the National Advisory Committee on Immunization is out of an abundance of precaution and is based on the higher number of adolescents and young adults who experienced myocarditis/pericarditis after receiving the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (100 mcg dose) versus with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (30mcg dose). For children five years of age starting their COVID-19 vaccine (the age group in which both the Moderna Spikevax (25 mcg) and the Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty primary series are authorized): Moderna Spikevax (25 mcg) may be offered to children five years of age instead of the Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty (10 mcg); however, the use of Pfizer-BioNTech mcg) is preferred to Moderna Spikevax (25 mcg). For children six to 11 years of age: The Moderna Spikevax COVID-19 vaccine will be available upon request at Ottawa Public Health clinic, with informed consent, as an alternative to the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to start or continue the series in children aged six to 11 years of age. PLEASE NOTE: |Booking a vaccine appointment| | | Everyone aged six months and older at the time of their appointment is currently eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. | | Who can receive a COVID-19 vaccine primary series? | | |How can individuals access the Novavax (Nuvaxovid) COVID-19 vaccine?| | | Individuals cannot book through the provincial portal. Booking is done through local public health units. Our COVID-19 vaccine |Who can receive a three dose primary series?| | | A three-dose primary series is recommended for certain individuals. A 'three-dose' primary series refers to a series of three doses of the COVID-19 vaccine to make up a primary series offered to those who are moderately to severely immunocompromised. A third dose is added to the standard two-dose \"primary vaccine series\" to improve the immune response and establish an adequate level of protection for those who did not develop immunity or did not develop an optimal immune response after a 2-dose primary series (the exception is the monovalent Pfizer-BioNTech (3 mcg) primary series for individuals 6 months to 4 years which requires three doses to complete a standard primary series). An extended primary series constitutes administration of an additional dose to complete the primary series. See the COVID-19 chapter in Please see The recommended spacing between doses is eight weeks (56 days). In some cases, the number of days between doses may be shortened as advised by health care providers or specialists. Proof of immune status is no longer required to receive an additional primary series dose or priority access for a booster dose. Please see the |Who can receive a booster?| | | OPH recommends booster doses of COVID-19 vaccine for those who are eligible. Booster eligibility: Booster dose(s) are recommended for all eligible populations based on the ongoing risk of infection due to waning immunity, the ongoing risk of severe illness from COVID-19, the societal disruption that results from transmission of infections, and the adverse impacts on health system capacity from the COVID-19 pandemic. The optimal interval after a previous COVID-19 vaccination or confirmed SARSCoV-2 infection is 6 months. A shortened interval of at least 3 months may be considered in the context of heightened epidemiologic risk and for those at high risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes. Age-Based Recommendations: Infants and children 6 months to 4 years are not eligible for a booster dose at this time. Individuals 5 to11 years are eligible to receive a booster dose after completion of a primary COVID-19 vaccine series. The booster dose is recommended 6 months (168 days) after the previous dose or COVID-19 infection. However, people may choose to receive a booster dose as early as three months (84 days) after their previous dose with informed consent. As per the As per Booster eligibility for people 12 years of age and older People 12 years of age and older are eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine booster dose this 2022-23 respiratory season (after September 1, 2022), regardless of how many booster doses they have already received. The booster dose is recommended 6 months (168 days) after the previous dose or COVID-19 infection. The Ministry of Health strongly All other people may choose to receive their booster dose as early as three months (84 days) after their previous dose with informed consent. As per the People who have already received a booster dose (monovalent or bivalent) this respiratory season (September 1, 2022 onward) do not require an additional booster dose of a COVID-19 vaccine at this time. Both the monovalent and bivalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccines will boost the immune response and are expected to provide good protection. These recommendations are based What is the optimal interval between the first and second dose for 2-dose COVID-19 vaccines for children? The optimal interval between doses of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine is two months or eight weeks. This interval applies to two and three dose primary series. Children aged six months to four years: - Pfizer BioNTech Comirnaty 3mcg dose is a 3-dose primary series. Each dose is given two months (56 days) apart. - Caregivers may choose, with informed consent to follow a shorter interval between the 1st and 2nd doses. The shorter interval is 21 days. The shortest interval between the second and third dose is 56 days. Children aged six months to under five years: Moderna Spikevax 25 mcg dose: - NACI recommends at least eight weeks between the first and second dose. What we know is that a longer interval between doses can provide better protection overall. - In older age groups, longer vaccine intervals have shown to reduce the risk of myocarditis/pericarditis. (To note: in study participants six months to five years, no cases of myocarditis/pericarditis occurred) - Caregivers may choose, with informed consent, to follow a shorter interval between dose one and two. The shorter interval could be as early as 28 days after the first dose. Children aged five to 11 years: - More data has become available that suggests that protection can be improved upon when the interval between the first and second dose are extended beyond the original manufacturer's recommended interval (e.g., 21 days between first and second dose of a Comirnaty/Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine; 28 days between first and second doses of a Moderna Spikevax COVID-19 vaccine for children aged 6-11). - As per NACI, an eight week interval helps balance optimal protection while simultaneously minimizing the time at risk of infection due to having protection from only one dose. There is emerging safety data that suggest that a longer interval between dose one and two may reduce the risk of myocarditis/pericarditis after the second dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. - Individuals may choose to speak with their primary care provider about what interval is best for them considering the local transmission of COVID-19 and the degree of individual risk of exposure. - The authorized interval may still be used with informed parental consent. - You can get your child's second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech 10 mcg as early as 21 days after their first by providing informed consent at one of our clinics or by calling the province at 1-833-943-3900. - You can get your child's second dose of a Moderna Spikevax vaccine as early as 28 days after their first by providing informed consent at one of our clinics and upon request - Interruption of a vaccine series resulting in a greater interval between doses than recommended does not require re-starting the series.

Apply it to the upper, outer thigh for babies 6 months to 12 months 30-60 minutes before the appointment. Follow manufacturer instructions. - Stay calm and use a normal speaking voice. Do not threaten or punish, it will only make them more afraid. - After the vaccine, give comfort (hugs, cuddles) and lots of praise! Young children: - Consider using a topical anesthetic like EMLA or AMETOP. Apply to upper arm (over the deltoid) about 30-60 minutes before the appointment time. Follow manufacturer instructions. - Prepare your child ahead of time by reading stories about what to expect. Be honest and use language they will understand (i.e., it will feel like a pinch). - Tell your child what they can do to ease the pain (for example, sit still, breathe deeply, relax the arm like jello). - Sit them on your lap (for smaller children). The immunizer will instruct you on how to position them and talk you through the injection. - Bring your child's favourite stuffy or blanket for comfort. - Stay calm and distract your child by talking to them and giving encouragement. Do not threaten or punish as this will only make them more afraid. Sing a song, tell a joke or a story. - Give lots of praise once the injection is done! Older children (six years of age and older): - Consider using an anesthetic cream like EMLA or AMETOP (see above section for instructions). - Prepare your child on what to expect, a day or two before the appointment. - Stay calm and encourage your child during the injection. Using threats or punishment only makes the situation more stressful. - Distract them by telling stories, jokes or practicing deep breathing together. - If your child is moving a lot, ask the immunizer to assist you with proper holding techniques that are safest for your older child.

There is a lower percentage of COVID related hospitalizations, ICU admissions, deaths, and severe complications/outcomes with children. The impact of COVID-19 infection may be lesser, but the mental impact on children has shown to be very significant. COVID-19 has resulted in loss of in-person school and reduced social interactions with peers meaning increased stress and negative mental health for children. Vaccination is a means to ensuring children can continue their routines of daily life and not miss out on important things. |What is the difference between 'natural immunity' and 'vaccine induced immunity'? Should I still get my child vaccinated if they have already had a COVID-19 infection?| | | Natural immunity (immunity from exposure) is when the body creates protection against a virus once your body has been exposed or infected by it. Natural immunity means the body has some form of defence against a virus due to exposure or infection - not due to a vaccine. With COVID-19 exposure or infection, natural immunity can protect you, but we don't know how well or for how long. We do know that whatever protection the body has gained weakens over time. Vaccine induced immunity (immunity from a vaccine) is the body's defence against a virus after getting a vaccine. This is a more controlled way (through clinic trials, testing and surveillance) to provide immunity against a virus without the harmful risks of being infected. This is especially true with COVID-19 infection which can cause serious and long-term illness and death. Getting a COVID-19 infection can be very risky, even for children (see post-COVID symptoms). Being infected means you can spread it to others, and some people will develop serious illness, complications or require hospitalization from COVID-19. There is still much we don't know about this virus and its long-term effects on the body. COVID-19 is still present in our community, and variants like Omicron are very contagious, causing a lot of illness in our homes, schools, and child care settings. Choosing to get vaccinated as soon as your child is eligible (including booster doses) will provide the best protection from serious illness and complications from COVID-19. It is recommended to be vaccinated Find out Vaccine safety, approval and myths |How do I know that vaccines are safe?| | | Health Canada has one of the most rigorous scientific review systems in the world and only approves a vaccine if it is safe, works, and meets the highest manufacturing and quality standards. Vaccines undergo a comprehensive review of their safety, quality and efficacy (how well they work) before they are approved and can be used in Canada. After approval, vaccines are continually monitored through a \"vaccine safety surveillance\" to ensure their safety. Ottawa Public Health is involved in this surveillance process by investigating all reports of Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFIs) and reporting them to Public Health Ontario. An AEFI is a serious or unexpected reaction that happens after someone receives a vaccine, which may or may not be caused by the vaccine. In Ontario, health professionals like nurses and doctors are required to report AEFIs to their local public health unit like Ottawa Public Health. For more information on this process you can visit |How the vaccines are studied and tested for children and youth| | | Health Canada evaluates drugs and vaccines before they can be sold in Canada. They also monitor real-world evidence while they are on the market. When a company decides it would like to sell a drug or vaccine in Canada, it files a submission with Health Canada. A new drug submission contains detailed scientific information about the drug's safety, efficacy and quality. Health Canada scientific reviewers evaluate data to assess the potential benefits and risks of a drug or vaccine. They also review the information that will be provided to health care practitioners and consumers about the product. After the review, they may authorize the drug or vaccine for sale in Canada only if the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks.

There were no major safety concerns noted in study participants. Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (10 mcg) for children aged five to 11 years There were no serious side effects related to the vaccine reported in this age group. Local reactions including pain, redness and swelling at the injection site were very common. They were mostly mild to moderate in severity. The local reactions generally started about one to two days after receiving the vaccine and lasted about one to two days. Other reactions included: These reactions occurred more frequently after the second dose and were mild to moderate in severity. They generally started about one to four days after either dose of the vaccine and lasted about one day. Find more information about According to NACI, interim findings from Phase 2/3 clinical trial conducted in the US and Canada did not indicate any safety concerns. However, any rare adverse events would not be known due to the size of the trial. Per the Ministry of Health and in accordance with NACI, the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is preferentially recommended in this age group. It is common to have temporary side effects following vaccination. Local reaction at the injection site include redness, soreness and swelling. The local reactions generally started one to two days after receiving the vaccine and lasted about three days. Other reactions include: If someone experiences an adverse event following immunization (AEFI), they should report it to a healthcare professional (e.g., family doctor). An AEFI is an unwanted or unexpected health effect that happens after someone receives a vaccine, which may or may not be caused by the vaccine. There is a safety system to monitor for AEFIs and to investigate them. You can find more information on what is done if someone develops an adverse reaction here: For more information, please visit: | | What is Hybrid Immunity? | | Hybrid immunity is when you have been sick with COVID-19 and have also had the COVID-19 vaccine. Hybrid immunity gives stronger protection than having the vaccine alone or just being infected with the virus. Many children have been sick with COVID-19 while Omicron has been the main circulating COVID-19 variant. Children can better protect themselves, even if they have been sick with COVID-19, by getting a full vaccination series - including booster doses when eligible. Children 6 months to 5 years of age who are sick with COVID-19, should wait 8 weeks after the symptoms start (or after a positive test if no symptoms) to get a COVID-19 vaccine. To learn more about vaccination after a COVID-19 infection, see: | | What is the risk of myocarditis/pericarditis from the COVID-19 vaccine vs from COVID-19 Infection for children? | | COVID-19 affects children differently than adults. There is a lower percentage of COVID-19 related hospitalizations, ICU admissions, deaths, and severe complications/outcomes with children. But children with COVID-19 infection are at risk of MIS-C (multisystem inflammatory syndrome). MIS-C is a rare but serious syndrome that can occur several weeks after a COVID-19 infection. Myocarditis and pericarditis can also occur as a complication of COVID-19 infection in children, but this is rare. In Canada, there have been reported cases of myocarditis and pericarditis in people 12 years and over who received the 30mcg dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine or the 100mcg dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. It is important to note that the risk is rare. In adolescents and young adults the risk of myocarditis/pericarditis with Moderna Spikevax (100 mcg) was higher than with Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty (30mcg). Currently, the risk of myocarditis/pericarditis in children six months to 11 years, following immunization is unknown. Based on the studies done so far, myocarditis and/or pericarditis were not detected. Safety surveillance data from individuals aged 12 and older does not suggest the risk of myocarditis/pericarditis following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination would be greater in children aged five to 11 years compared to older populations. Also, data from older age groups also suggests that an extended interval between the first and second dose (at least eight weeks) may also be associated with a reduced risk of myocarditis/pericarditis following a second dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Please seek medical attention if your child develops symptoms including chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations following immunization. Health Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada and NACI (National Advisory Committee on Immunization) will continue to monitor and review the emerging evidence on the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine. They will update their recommendation, as well as its strength, as the evidence base evolves. For more information, please read: |Can my child get their COVID-19 vaccine if they have recently received another vaccine or will be getting one soon?| | | For children 6 months to 5 years: On December 9, 2022, NACI updated their guidance now recommending that COVID-19 vaccines may be given on the same day as or at any time before or after non-COVID-19 vaccines for children 6 months to 5 years of age. For children aged five years and older: COVID-19 vaccines may be given at the same time, or before or after a non COVID-19 vaccine. This is done with informed consent. There are no specific safety concerns when routine vaccines are given at the same time or within days of each other. There could be stronger, temporary side effects when a COVID-19 vaccine and another vaccine are given at the same time or within days of each other. | | My child is 5 years old. Should they receive the Moderna Spikevax 25mcg dose? Or the Pfizer Comirnaty 10mcg dose? | | Children five years of age are recommended to start the primary vaccine series with the Pfizer BioNTech Comirnaty (10mcg dose) vaccine. Children who start a Moderna Spikevax (25mcg) vaccine series should generally complete the primary series with a second Moderna Spikevax dose appropriate for their age, at an interval of at least eight weeks. As per the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI): \"If readily available (i.e., easily available at the time of vaccination without delay or vaccine wastage), the same mRNA COVID-19 vaccine product should be offered for the subsequent dose in a vaccine series started with a specific mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. However, when the same mRNA vaccine product is not readily available, is unknown, or is no longer authorized for the age group (e.g., once a child has turned 6 years of age), another mRNA COVID-19 vaccine product recommended in that age group can be considered interchangeable.\" |Can children who have already tested positive for COVID-19 get a COVID-19 vaccine?| | | Yes. According to the For individuals six months and older with a previous COVID-19 infection, it is suggested, they can receive the vaccine eight weeks after symptoms began, or after positive test result (if no symptoms). This interval applies to an infection before a first and second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. For individuals five to 11 years of age who are eligible to receive a booster dose, it is suggested, they can receive their booster dose six months after symptoms began, or after positive test result (if no symptoms). Individuals may receive their vaccine (first, second or booster dose) when they have completed their isolation and no longer have symptoms with informed consent. New evidence shows that a longer interval between a COVID-19 infection and vaccination is associated with improved antibody responses to COVID-19 vaccines. Children with a history of MIS-C (multisystem inflammatory syndrome) may be vaccinated once they have recovered or once it has been more than 90 days since diagnosis, whichever is longer. There is no information that suggests that antibodies from a recent COVID-19 infection would interfere with vaccine efficacy. Vaccination continues to be very important, as individuals previously infected with COVID-19 may remain at risk of Omicron infection. Numerous reports have documented the risk of reinfection with Omicron is higher than risk of reinfection with previous variants. |My child is 11 years old. Should I wait until they are 12 years old and get the 'larger' dose, or get the dose that is available to them now?| | | No, you should not wait until your child is 12 to get the 'larger'/adult dose. Children should get the first COVID-19 vaccine that is available to them. At Ottawa Public Health clinics, children who are 11 at the time of their appointment will receive the 10-mcg dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. The 10-mcg pediatric Pfizer-BioNTech formulation of the vaccine has been assessed for safety in the five to 11 year old population in clinical trials and these trials did not indicate any serious safety concerns. Alternatively, eligible children 11 years can receive the pediatric Moderna Spikevax 50 mcg dose. According to NACI, the use of Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty (10 mcg dose) is preferred to start or continue the primary vaccine series. The 10 micrograms (mcg) Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is approved for use in children aged five to 11 years, compared to the 30-mcg vaccine which is approved for adolescents and adults 12 years of age and older. The Moderna Spikevax 50 mcg dose is approved for use in children aged 6 to 11 years, compared to the 100 mcg dose approved for adolescents and adults 12 years of age and older. According to the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI), clinical trial data indicates the pediatric formulation of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (10 mcg) produces a good immune response in children 5-11 years of age, similar to the response seen in young adults 16 to 25 years of age who receive the adolescent/adult dose (30 mcg). Health Canada has authorized the use of Moderna (Spikevax) 50 mcg vaccine for children aged six to 11 years. Individuals aged 6 to 29 years of age can request Moderna (Spikevax). It can be accessed with informed consent, acknowledging that the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine is preferentially recommended due to the elevated risk of myocarditis/pericarditis associated with the Moderna (Spikevax) vaccine. | | Can I ask that a smaller dose be given to my child if they are smaller for their age or a larger dose if they are bigger for their age? | | Ottawa Public Health will be following the vaccine recommendation based on age and not weight in their clinics. This approach is based on their training and how the companies are saying vaccines should work.

Alternatively, your child can get the 50 mcg dose of the Moderna Spikevax COVID-19 for their first dose and receive the 100 mcg dose of the adolescent/ adult vaccine for their second dose when they are 12. It is important to note that, according to NACI, the use of Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty (10 mcg dose) is preferred to Moderna Spikevax (50 mcg dose) to start or continue the primary vaccine series. According to NACI, children who receive the pediatric formulation of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (10 mcg) for their first dose who turn 12 by the time of their second dose will receive the adolescent/adult formulation of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (30 mcg) to complete their primary series. For more information: See the FAQ: Health Canada has authorized the use of Moderna (Spikevax) 50 mcg vaccine for children aged six to 11 years. Individuals aged 6 to 29 years of age can request Moderna (Spikevax). It can be accessed with informed consent, acknowledging that the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine is preferentially recommended due to the elevated risk of myocarditis/pericarditis associated with the Moderna (Spikevax) vaccine. |Vaccine myths| | | Vaccine confidence is an important focus for Ottawa Public Health.
