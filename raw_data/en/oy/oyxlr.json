Names are PRECOSE or acarbose and GLYSET or miglitol. Treat lows only with glucose. Will not create low sugars when used alone. Biguanides Biguanides (by -GWAN -ides) decrease the amount of glucose made by your liver. Name is METFORMIN or glucophag e. If a liquid, called RIOMET . Take with food to decrease nausea when starting it. Follow your B12 levels to sure sufficient . Do not take on days of surgery, illness, or dye studies until eating and drinking normally, and urinating well. D-Phenylalanine D-Phenylalanine (dee- fen-nel-AL-ah-neen) derivatives help your pancreas make more insulin quickly. Name: PRANDIN or repanglinide. Take just before eating. Do not take if skipping a meal. Do not take with Gemfibrizol, and avoid grapefruit juice. Has ability to lower sugars to too low. DPP-IV Inhibitors DPP-IV inhibitors boost production of the incretin gut hormones GLP -1 and GIP to help lower blood glucose levels. It increases insulin production and cuts down on glucagon production to lessen glucose from the liver. Do not make sugars go too low, if used omargliptin. Report new joint pain immediately. Meglitinide Meglitinide is a type 2 oral medication that helps your pancreas make more insulin right after meals. Name: STARLIX or nateglinide. Take just before eating, skip dose if not eating. Thiazolidinedione Thiazolidinedione (THIGH -ah-ZO-li-deen- DYE- owns) make you more sensitive to insulin. Name: AVANDIA or rosiglitazone , which is not available except through specialty pharmacy. ACTOS or pioglitazone is available. Some weight gain, not used in Congestive Heart Failure, but has long effect on glucose control. Best used in low do sage. Bone loss in females and bladder cancer in men have been reported. Sulfonylureas Sulfonylureas (SUL -fah-nil-YOO -ree-ahs) stimulate your pancreas to make more insulin so have the potential to make glucose go too low. They also contribute to weight gain, especially when used with insulin. Name: Glucotrol (glipizide), Micronase. Diabeta or Glynase are all glyburide. one used most often now is AMARYL or glimepiri de. SGLT -2s This newest class of oral medications works by slowing down the glucose -recovery process initiated by the kidneys. INVOKANA or canagliflozin. Side effect is weight loss an d blood pressure improvement. Some urinary tract infections and yeast, easily treated with over the counter medication. Uncircumcised men not good candidates for this. May pose low blood pressure if glucosuria (sugar in the urine) is extreme. Doctor may lower blood pressure medications to start with or ask you to drink an extra glass or two of water per day at the start. FARXGIA or dapagliflozin is the second drug in this class with many more on the way. Also JARDIANCE or empagliflozin is available. GLP-1 Agonists GLP-1 agonists, administered via injectable devices, work in conjunction with other drugs to help people with type 2 maintain control. Names: BYETTA (exenatide) taken twice a day, VICTOZA (liraglutide ) taken once per day, and BYDUREON (extended release exenatide) taken weekly. Works to decrease appetite, hold liver from releasing too much glucose , increase the insulin production, slow stomach emptying and lead to weight loss in \u00be of the persons who use these products.

Amylin was co -secreted with insulin. The synthetic version, Symlin, replaces the effects of amylin. So slower gastric emptying, less sugar from the liver released and satiety after eating. Much like the GLP effect, but does not increase insulin producti on- it was made with the insulin before diabetes. Combination Oral Medicines BROMOCRIPTINE CYCLOSET is a medication that works on the hypothalamus, an area in the brain to decrease your insulin resistance. Used at low levels, it compliments the use of the GLP -1 drugs. M etformin and pioglitazone have lost patent, so are used for type 2 when response to monotherapy is inadequate, but do no more than what the individual drugs taken separately did. Names: Miscellaneous Agents These agents have a smaller effect on lowering blood sugar . They may be used in cases when just a little help is needed or where other choices are limited. WELCHOL colesevelam is a medication used tob ring LDL cholesterol down, but also has a mild effect on glucose to help along with other medications to lower A1c . RANEXA ranolazine approved for use in angina but has glucose lowering properties. Action results from increased efficiency of myocardial oxygen use when myocardial metabolism is shifted away from fatty acid oxidation toward glucose oxidation. Don't crush tablets and avoid grapefruit juice. NEW PRODUCTS : From SANOFI TOUJEO This is insulin glargine (or Lantus u100) that is more concentrated in a U -300 concentration. The fact that less insulin is needed per depot of injection, the profile is much smoother baseline coverage that lasts better for a 24 hour period than Lantus did. Adlxyin , or . Ad lxyin comes in pre -filled pen. Green pen is the low multiple dose pen. Starting dose is 10mcg daily for 14 days . Burgundy pen is the multiple dose pen and is 20 mcg daily starting on day 15 of treatment.

BASAGLAR The first biosimilar insulin to come to the US market. While used by 30% in Europe, just hitting the US market Dec of 2016. It is the glargine molecule grown by Lilly. Expectation is that it will work like the glargine (Lantus) did before. The major difference will be the much lower price of $316.85 for 5 pens. Appreciably lower than Lantus, Levemir, Toujeo or Tresiba. Has a $5 -Medicare ADMELOG a biosimilar lispro or mealtime insulin, like 12- 11-17 From NOVONORDISK 9-25-2015 TRESIBA u -100 AND u- 200 insulin degludec From Novo Nordisk, a long acting, human basal insulin given once daily, at the same time or anytime of day.

Start at 10 units with Type 2's, make adjustments only after 3- 4 days of treatment to see steady state. Onset in one hour, maximum glucose lowering effect seen in 12 hours . Pen displays in 2 unit increments. *After a pparent clinical recovery from hypoglycemia, continued observation and additional carbohydrate intake may be necessary to avoid recurrence of hypoglycemia. It forms multi -hexamers when injected into sub- q tissue, resulting in a depot. Tresiba is predominantly due to delayed absorption of insulin degludec from the sub- q tissue to the systemic circulation and to a lesser extent due to binding of insulin degludec to circulating albumin. Not studied in children under 18 and is pregnancy Class C. XULTOPHY 100/3.6 (European name) of insulin degludec with liraglutide.

The Ominous Octet Islet -cell Impaired Insulin Secretion Lipolysis Article http://diabetes.webmd.com/alpha- glucosidase- inhibitors -for-type-2-diabetes Diabetes Health Center Alpha -Glucosidase Inhibitors for Type 2 Diabetes Examples Generic Name Brand Name acarbose Precose miglitol Glyset How It Works Acarbose and miglitol help keep blood sugar levels within a target range by slowing the digestion of complex carbohydrates , also called starches. Complex carbohydrates include foods like bread, cereal, grain, pasta, rice, flour, beans, and vegetables like potatoes and corn. These medicines do not change the effect that simple sugars have on blood sugar. Sim ple sugars include foods like fruit, juice, milk, honey, desserts, and candy. The medicine is taken with the first bite of food. These medicines do not cause the pancreas to produce more insulin . They will not cause low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) unless they are used with other oral medicines for diabetes or with insulin . Why It Is Used Alpha -glucosidase inhibitors help people with type 2 diabetes whose blood sugar is highest after eating complex carbohydrates. The medicine may be used alone, with another medicine for diabetes, or with insulin. How Well It Works Type 2 diabetes is a disease that can get worse over time, so medicines may need to change. Diabetes medicines work best for people who are being active and eating healthy foods. When taken with the first bite of food, these medicines have been found to lower blood sugar levels in people who have high blood sugar after eating (postprandial hyperglycemia). Studies have suggested that alpha- glucosidase inhibitors lower hemoglobin A1c by 0.5% to 0.8%.1 Side Effects All medicines have side effects. But many people don't feel the side effects, or they are able to deal with them. Ask your pharmacist about the side effects of each medicine you take. Side effects are also listed in the information that comes with your medicine. Here are some important things to think about: Usually the benefits of the medicine are more important than any minor side effects. Side effects may go away after you take the medicine for a while. If side effects still bother you and you wonder if you should keep taking the medicine, call your doctor . He or she may be able to lower your dose or change your medicine. Do not suddenly quit taking your medicine unless your doctor tells you to. Call911or other emergency services right away if you have: Trouble breathing. Hives . Swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat. Call your doctor if you have: Yellow eyes . Yellow skin. Common side effects of this medicine include: Passing of gas. Feeling bloated. Belly pain. Diarrhea. See Drug Reference for a full list of side effects. (Drug Reference is not available in all systems.) What To Think About These medicines do not cause low blood sugar or weight gain, but you might have low blood sugar if you don't eat or if you exercise, drink alcohol, or use another medicine that causes low blood sugar. When taking this medicine, low blood sugar can be treated with quick -sugar foods except table sugar or regular soda pop, which will not work. If you pass a lot of gas while taking this medicine, your doctor may suggest a lower dose and then increase the dose slowly. Eating a lower -carbohydrate diet can also help. If you have problems with your digestive system , you might not be able to take this medicine. 1. American Diabetes Association (2009). Medical management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: A consensus algorithm for the initiation and adjustment of therapy. Diabetes Care or Galega officianalis So, Metformin came from a plant, and has been used as a tea over 3000 years ago to relieve polyuria (frequent urination) and halitosis (sweet odor on the breath). Both of these are diabetes symptoms. It has been used in the US since 1995 and is the most widely prescribed drug filled yearly worldwide . The mechanism of Glucophage is not fully understood but believed to decrease the production of glucagon (the hormone that causes sugar to appear in the blood stream) which then decreases the amount of sugar the liver releases. It also helps a bit with the insulin sensitization, getting the glucose or sugar into the cells where it is needed. When used in the Diabetes Pre vention Trial, the metformin taking arm of the trial decreased getting diabetes by 31%! It can be started in Pre -Diabetes. The earlier it is taken in the course of diabetes, the longer it is able to control the blood sugars. Metformin has been suggested to be a cancer preventer -lung, colorectal, endometrial, ovarian, pancreatic, breast, prostate tissues. Metformin has modest impact on LDL, HDL, triglycerides and is weight neutral. It d oes not creat hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) by itself. Several cautio ns: Take the first doses with food to decrease any nausea that might happen. Nausea, or diarrhea, are expected to go way down, disappear, over time. Some never get symptoms. Metformin is started low, at 500 mg, then increased as you tolerate it (no nau sea, no diarrhea). The dose you want to be at is 1000mg in the AM and 1000mg in the PM. After you have been on it awhile, taking with food is not important any longer. This is the most effective range for Metformin. Some do better with Glucophage ER or XR. If having tests with dye done, surgery, or acutely ill, do not take Metformin that day and up to two days later when once eating and urinating normally . Staff in surgery or x-ray will help you remember this. If taken while the kidneys are trying to clear the dye, it is a big load and the metformin can become concentrated. A problem called Lactic Acidosis can develop - tummy discomfort, trouble breathing. This disappears as the metformin is cleared. People with low function of the kidneys are not candidates for Metformin. Have B12 checked regularly. We need vitamin B12 to keep our nerves working right. Metformin can interfere with this, so replacement may need to be done. If not, neuropathy (painful nerves) can develop. Once established, taking B12 does not help, so prevention is important. Your providers know this too. A novel cobiotic containing a prebiotic and an antioxidant augments the glucose control and gastrointestinal tolerability of metformin: case report. Greenway S , Heiman M . Source Pennington Biomedical Research Center, Outpatient Clinic, Louisiana State University System, 6400 Perkins Road, Baton Rouge, LA 70808, USA . Abstract The gut microbiome plays an important role in regulation of metabolic processes, including digestion, absorption, and synthesis of bioactive molecules that signal physiological host mechanisms. Changes in the human gut microbiome are associated with type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance. Water -soluble dietary fibres like inulin and beta- glucan the colon, and beta- glucan increases viscosity. Blueberries improve insulin sensitivity through an antioxidant effect. A cobiotic, consisting of purified inulin, sugar -free blueberry pomace extract, and an oat preparation of purified beta -glucan was developed for twice a day (bid) consumption as a smoothie drink to repair the gastrointestinal dysbiosis in type 2 diabetes. A 30- year-old man presented with new onset type 2 diabetes and a fasting glucose (FBS) of 375 mg/dl. Metformin 500 mg bid was initiated and increased to 1 g bid after 1 week. During the first 9 days of metformin treatment, he developed diarrhoea, but his FBS only dropped to 325 mg/dl. The cobiotic bid was added on the 9th day of metformin treatment, and after 2 days, his FBS dropped to 175 mg/dl. After 8 weeks on metformin and the cobiotic, his blood sugar was 100 mg/dl and he lost 5.5 kg. His stools became soft and formed on the cobiotic, reverted to diarrhoea when off of it for 2 days, and returned to normal on resuming the cobiotic formulation. Metformin is a safe, effective and inexpensive generic medication favouring weight loss, recommended as initial treatment of type 2 diabetes by the American Diabetes Association. However, a 20% incidence of diarrhoea limits its tolerability. A safe food supplement that can increase the efficacy of metformin and its tolerability, as occurred in this case report, would have significant positive public health consequences. A controlled clinical trial of the cobiotic with metformin is planned. 1 Medication Guide JANUVIA\u00ae (jah-NEW -vee-ah) (sitagliptin) Tablets Read this Medication Guide carefully before you start taking JANUVIA and each time you get a refill.

What is type 2 diabetes? 6 Type 2 diabetes is a condition in which your body does not make enough insulin, and the insulin that your body produces does not work as well as it should. Your body can also make too much sugar. When this happens, sugar (glucose) builds up in the blood. This can lead to serious medical problems. High blood sugar can be lowered by diet and exercise, and by certain medicines when necessary. What should I know about high cholesterol? Cholesterol is a type of fat found in your blood. Cholesterol comes from two sources. It is produced by your body and it comes from the food you eat. Your total cholesterol is made up of both LDL and HDL cholesterol. LDL cholesterol is called \" bad\" cholesterol because it can build up in the wall of your arteries and form plaque, which can slow or block blood flow to your heart, brain, and other organs. HDL cholesterol is called \" good\" cholesterol because it keeps the bad cholesterol from building up in the arteries. Triglycerides also are fats found in your body.

The risk increases with con ditions such as renal impairment, sepsis, dehydration, excess alcohol intake, hepatic impairment, and acute congestive heart failure. The onset is often subtle, accompanied only by nonspecific symp toms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal distress. Laboratory abnormalities includ e low pH, increased anion gap, and elevated blood lactate. If acidosis is suspected, JENTADUETO should be di scontinued and the patient hospitalized immediately [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE 1.1 Indication JENTADUETO tablets are indicated as an adjunct to diet and exerci se to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus when treatment with both linagliptin and metformin is appropriate [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Clinical Studies (14.1)]. 1.2 Important Limitations of Use JENTADUETO should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes or for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis, as it would not be effective in these settings. JENTADUETO has not been studied in patients with a history of pancreatitis. It is unknown whether patients with a history of p ancreatitis are at an increased risk for the development of pancreatitis while using JENTADUETO [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 2.1 Recommended Dosing The dosage of JENTADUETO should be individualized on the basis of both effectiveness and tole rability, while not exceeding the maximum recommended dose of 2.5 mg linagliptin/1000 mg metformin hydrochloride twice daily. JENTAD UETO should be given twice dail y with meals. Dose escalatio n should be gradual to reduce the gastrointestinal (GI) side effects asso ciated with metformin use. For available dosage forms and strengths see [Dosage Forms and Strengths (3)] . Recommended starting dose: In patients currently not treated with metformin, initiate treat ment with 2.5 mg linagliptin/500 mg metformin hydrochloride twi ce daily In patients already treated with metformin, start with 2.5 mg linagliptin and the current dose of metformin taken at each of th e two daily meals (e.g., a patient on metformin 1000 mg twice daily would be started on 2.5 mg linaglip tin/1000 mg metformin hydrochlor ide twice daily with meals). Patients already treated with linagliptin a nd metformin individual components may be switched to JENTADUET O containing the same doses of each component. No studies have been performed specifically examining the safety and efficacy of JENTADUETO in patients previously treated with other oral antihyperglycemic agents and switched to JENTADUETO. Any change in therapy of type 2 diabetes mell itus should be undertaken with care and appropriate monitoring as changes in glycemic control can occur. 2.2 Concomitant Use with an Insulin Secretagogue (e.g., Sulfonylurea) or with Insulin When JENTADUETO is used in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or with insulin, a lower dose of the i nsulin secretagogue or insulin may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. 3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS JENTADUETO is a combination of linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride. JENTADUETO tablets are available in the following dosage forms and strengths: 2.5 mg linagliptin/500 mg metformin hydrochloride tablets are li ght yellow, oval, biconvex tablet s debossed with \"D2/500\" on on e side and the Boehringer Ingelheim logo on the other side 2.5 mg linagliptin/850 mg metformin hydrochloride tablets are li ght orange, oval, biconvex tablet s debossed with \"D2/850\" on on e side and the Boehringer Ingelheim logo on the other side 2.5 mg linagliptin/1000 mg metformin hydrochloride tablets are li ght pink, oval, biconvex tablet s debossed with \"D2/1000\" on on e side and the Boehringer Ingelheim logo on the other side 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS JENTADUETO is contraindicated in patients with: Renal impairment (e.g., serum creatinine 1.5 mg/dL for men, 1.4 mg/dL for women, or abnormal creatinine cl earance) which may also result from conditions such as cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, and septicemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.3)] Acute or chronic metabolic acidosis, including diabetic ketoacidos is. Diabetic ketoacidosis should be treated with insulin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] A history of hypersensitivity reaction to linagliptin (such angioedema, or metformi n [see PRECAUTIONS Lactic Acidosis Metformin Lactic acidosis is a serious, metabolic complication that can occur due to metformin accumulation during treatment with JENTADU ETO and is fatal in approximately 50% of cases. Lactic acidosis may also occu r in association with a number of pathop hysiologic conditions, including diabetes m ellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (>5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels of >5 \u00b5g/mL are generally found. The reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receivi ng metformin (with fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metf ormin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic aci dosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with sign ificant renal impairment, including both in trinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple 4concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring ph armacologic management, particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia due to unstable or acute failure, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal impairment and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin. In particular, treatment of the elde rly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal functio n. Metformin treatment should not be initiated in any patient unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced. In additio n, metformin should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may signi ficantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin should be avoided in patients w ith clinical or laboratory evidence of he patic impairment. Patie nts should be cautione d against excessive alcohol intake when taking metformin, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin on lactate metabo lism. In addition, metformin should be te mporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure necessitating restricted intake of food or fluids. Use of topiramate, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, in e-dependent metabolic acidosis the risk of [see Drug Interactions . The onset of lactic acidosis is often subtle, and accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory di stress, increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal distress. More severe acidosis may be associated with signs such as hypothermia, hypotension, and resist ant bradyarrhythmias. Patients should be educated to recognize and promptly report these symptoms . If present, JENTADUETO should be discontinued un til lactic acidosis is ruled out. Gastrointestinal symptoms, which are commonly reported during initiation of metfor min therapy are less frequently observed in subjects on a chro nic, stable, dose of metformin. Gastrointestinal symptoms in subjects on chronic, stable, dose of metformin could be caused by lactic acidosis or other serious To rule out lactic serum electr olytes, ketones, blood glucose, blood pH, lactate levels, and blood metformin levels m ay be useful. Levels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in patients ta king metformin do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be due to other mechanisms, such as poorly-controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity , or technical problems in sa mple handling . Lactic acidosis should be suspected in an y diabetic patient with metabolic acidosis lacking evidence of ketoacidosis (ketonuria and ketonemia) . Lactic acidosis is a medical emergency that must be treated in a hospital setting. In a patient with lactic acidosis who is taking metformin, the dr ug should be discontinued immediately and supportive measures promptly instituted. Metformin is dialyzable (clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditi ons) and prompt hemodialysis is recommended to remove the accumulated metformin and correct the me tabolic acidosis. Such management often results in prompt rev ersal of symptoms and recovery [see Boxed Warning]. 5.2 Pancreatitis There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis, including fatal pancr eatitis, in patients taking linagliptin. Take careful notice of potential signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue JENTADU ETO and initiate appropriate management. It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for th e development of pancreatitis while using JENTADUETO. 5.3 Monitoring of Renal Function Although linagliptin undergoes minimal renal excretion, metformin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney. The risk of metformin accumulation and lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, JENTADUETO is contraindicated in patients with renal impairm ent. Before initiation of therapy with JENTADUETO and at least annually thereafter, renal function shoul d be assessed and verified t o be normal. In patients in whom development of renal impairment is anticipated (e.g., elderly) , renal function should be assessed more frequently and JENTADUET O discontinued if evidence of renal impairment is present. Linagliptin may be continued as a single entity tablet at the same total daily dose of 5 mg if JENTADUETO is discontinued due t o evidence of renal impairment. No dose adjustment of linagliptin is recommended in patients with renal impairment. Use of concomitant medications that may af fect renal function or metformin disposition : Concomitant medication(s) that may affect renal function or result in significant hemodynamic change or interfere with the disp osition of metformin should be used with caution [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Radiological studies and surgical procedures: Radiologic studies involving the use of intr and computed tomography) can lead to acute alteration of renal function and ha ve been associated with lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin. Therefore, in patients in whom any such study is planned, JENTADUETO shoul d be temporarily discontinued at the time of or prior to the procedure, and withheld for 48 hours subsequent to the procedure and reinstituted only after renal f unction has been confirmed to be normal. JENTADUETO should be temporarily discontinue d for any surgical procedure (except minor procedures not associated with restricte d intake of food and fluids) and should not be restarted until the patient's oral intake has resumed and renal function has been evaluated as normal. 5.4 Impaired Hepatic Function Because impaired hepatic function has been associated with some cases of lactic acidosis with metformin therapy, JENTADUETO sho uld generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laborat ory evidence of hepatic disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 5.5 Use with Medications Known to Cause Hypoglycemia Linagliptin Insulin secretagogues and insulin are known to cause hypoglycemia. The use of linagliptin in combin ation with an insulin secret agogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) was associated with a higher rate of hypoglycemia compared with placebo in a clinical trial [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . The use of linagliptin in combination with insulin in subjects with severe renal impairment was associated with a higher rate of hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . Therefore, a lowe r dose of the insulin secretagogue or insulin may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with JENTADUETO [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Metformin Hypoglycemia does not occur in patients receiving metformin alone under usual circumstances of use, but could occur when calori c intake is deficient, when strenuous exercise is not compensated by caloric supplementation, or duri ng concomitant use with other gluc ose-lowering agents (such as S Us and insulin) or ethanol. Elderly, debilitated, or malnourished patie nts, and those with adrenal or pituitary insu fficiency or alcohol intoxication are particular ly susceptible to hypoglycemic effects. Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in the elderly, and in people who are taking -adrenergic blocking drugs. 55.6 Vitamin B 12 Levels In controlled, 29-week clinical trials of metformin, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B 12 levels, without clinical manifestations, was observed in approximately 7% of metformin-treated patien ts. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B 12 absorption from the B 12-intrinsic factor complex, is, however, very rarely associated with anemia or neurologic manifestations due to the short duration (<1 year) of the clinical tr ials. This risk may be more relevant to patients receiving long-term treatment with me tformin, and adverse hemato logic and neurologic reacti ons have been reported post marketing. The decrease in vitamin B12 levels appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B 12 supplementation. Measurement of he matologic parameters on an annual basis is advised in patients on JENTADUETO and any apparent abnormalit ies should be appropriately investigated and managed . Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B 12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B 12 levels. In these patients, routine serum vitamin B12 measurement at 2- to 3-year intervals may be useful. 5.7 Alcohol Intake Alcohol is known to potentiate the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients, therefore, should be warned against exc essive alcohol intake while receiving JENTADUETO [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 5.8 Hypoxic States Cardiovascular collapse (shock) from whatever cause (e.g., acute congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, and oth er conditions characterized by hypoxemia) have been associated with lactic acidosis and may also cause prerenal azotemia. When such events occur in patients on JENTADUETO therapy, the drug should be promptly discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 5.9 Macrovascular Outcomes There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduc tion with linagliptin or metfor min or any other antidiabetic drug. 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditio ns, adverse reaction rates observe d in the clinical trials o f a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and ma y not reflect the rates observed in practice. Linagliptin/Metformin The safety of concomitantly administered linagliptin (daily dose 5 mg) and metformi n (mean daily dose of approximately 1800 mg) has been evaluated in 2816 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated for 12 weeks in clinical trials. Three placebo-controlled studies with linaglip tin + metformin were conducted: 2 studies were 24 weeks in duration, 1 study was 12 weeks in duration. In the 3 placebo-controlled clinical studies, adverse events which occurred in 5% of patients receiving linagliptin + metformi n (n=875) and were more common than in patients given placebo + metfor min (n=539) included nasopharyngitis (5.7% vs 4.3%). In a 24-week factorial design study, adverse events reported in 5% of patients receiving linagliptin + metformin and were more common than in patients given placebo are shown in Table 1. Table 1 Adverse Reactions Reported in 5% of Patients Treated with Linagliptin + Metformin and Greater than with Placebo in n (%) n (%) n (%) n (%) Nasopharyngitis 1 (1.4) 8 (5.6) 8 (2.7) 18 (6.3) Diarrhea 2 (2.8) 5 (3.5) 11 (3.8) 18 (6.3) Other adverse reactions reported in clinical studies with treatme nt of linagliptin + metformin we icaria, angioedema or bronchial hyperreactivity), appetite, nausea, vomiting, pruritu s, and pancreatitis. Linagliptin Adverse reactions reported in 2% of patients treated with linagliptin 5 mg and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo included: nasopharyngitis (7.0% vs 6.1%), diarrhea (3.3% vs 3.0%), and cough (2.1% vs 1.4%). Rates for other adverse reactions for linag liptin 5 mg vs placebo when linagliptin was used in combination with specific anti-d iabetic agents urinary hyperlipidemi (2.7% 0.8%) and weight (2.3% 0.8%) when was as and constipation (2.1% vs 1%) when linagliptin wa s used as add-on to basal insulin therapy. Other adverse reactions reported in clinical studies with treat ment of linagliptin monotherapy we re hypersensitivity (e.g., urt exfoliation, or bronchial hyperreactivity) and myalgia. In the clinical trial program, pancreatitis was reported in 15.2 cases per 10,000 patient year exposure while being treated with linagliptin compar ed with 3.7 cases per 10,000 patient year exposur e while being treated with comparator (placebo and active comparator, sulfonylurea). Three additional cases of pancreatitis were reported following the last administ ered dose of linagliptin. Metformin The most common adverse reactions due to initiation of metformin are diarrhea, nausea/ vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigesti on, abdominal discomfort, and headache. Long-term treatment with metformin has been associated with a decrease in vitamin B 12 absorption which may very rarely resu lt in clinically significant vitamin B 12 deficiency (e.g., megaloblastic anemia) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] reported in 4 (1.4%) of 286 subj treated with lin agliptin + metformin , 6 (2.1%) of 291 subjects treated with metformin, and 1 (1.4%) of 72 subjects treated with placebo. Wh en linagliptin was administered in combination with metformin a nd a sulfonylurea, 181 (22.9%) of 792 patients reported hypoglycemia compared with 39 (14.8%) of 263 patients administered placebo in combination with metformin and sulfonylurea. Adverse reactions of hypoglycemia were based on all reports of hypoglycem ia. A concurrent glucose measurement was not required or was normal in some patients. Therefore, it is not possible to conclusively determine th at all these reports reflect true hypoglycemia. Linagliptin In the study of patients receiving linagliptin as add-on therapy to a stable dose of insulin for up to 52 weeks (n=1261), no si gnificant difference in the incidence of investigator reported hypoglycemia , defined as all symptomatic or asymptomatic episodes with a self measured blood glucose 70 mg/dL, was noted between the linagliptin- (31.4%) and placebo- (32.9%) treated groups. Use in Renal Impairment Linagliptin was compared to placebo as add-on to pre-existing antidiabetic therapy over 52 weeks in 133 patients with severe re nal impairment (estimated GFR <30 mL/min). For the initial 12 weeks of the study, background antidiabetic therapy wa s kept stable and included insulin, sulfonyl urea, glinides, and pioglitazone. For the remainder of the trial, dose ad justments in antidiabetic backgr ound therapy were allowed. In general, the incidence of adverse events including severe hypoglycemia was similar to those reported in other linagliptin tr ials. The observed incidence of hypoglycemia was higher (linagliptin, 63% compared to placebo, 49%) due to an increase in asymptomatic hypoglycemic events espe cially during the first 12 weeks when background glycemic therapies were kept stable. Ten linag liptin-treated patients (15%) and 11 placebo-treated patients (17 %) reported at least one episode of confirmed symptomatic hypoglycemia (accompanying finger stick glucose 54 mg/dL). During the same time period, severe hypoglycemic events, defined as an event requiring the assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon or othe r resuscitative actions, were r eported in 3 (4.4%) linagliptin-treated patients and 3 (4.6%) placebo-trea ted patients. Events that were considered life-threatening or required hospitalization were reported in 2 (2.9%) patients on linagliptin and 1 (1.5%) patient on placebo. Renal function as measured by mean eGFR and creatinine clearance did not change over 52 weeks' treatment compared to placebo. Laboratory Tests Changes in laboratory findings were similar in patients treated with linag liptin + metformin compared to patients treated with placebo + metformin. Changes in laboratory values that occurred more frequen tly in the linagliptin + metformin group and 1% more than in the placebo group were not detected. No clinically meaningful changes in vital signs were observed in patients treated with linagliptin. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Additional adverse reactions have been id entified during postapproval use of linaglipti n. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Acute pancreatitis, including fatal pancreatitis [see Indications and Usage (1.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Rash 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Drug Interactions with Metformin Cationic Drugs that are eliminated by renal tubular secretion theoretically have the potential for interacti on with metformin by competing for common renal tubular transpo rt systems. Although such interactions remain theoretical (except for ci metidine), careful patient monitoring and dose adju stment of JENTADUETO and/or the interfering drug is recommended in patients who are taking cationic medications that are excreted via the proximal renal tubular secretory system [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Clinical Carbonic Inhibitors acetazolamide or dichlorphena mide) and induce non-anion gap, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Concomitant use of thes e drugs may induce metabolic acidosis. Use these drugs with caut ion in patients treated with JENTADUETO, as the risk of lactic acidosis may increase [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Drug Interactions with Linagliptin Inducers CYP3A4 Enzymes Rifampin decreased linagliptin exposure, sugge sting that the efficacy of linagliptin may be reduced when administered in combin ation with strong P-gp combination of lin agliptin and metformin, use of alternative treatments (not con taining linagliptin) is strongly recommended when concomitant treatment with a strong P-gp or CYP 3A4 inducer is . 7.3 Drugs Affecting Glycemic Control Certain drugs tend to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of glycemic control. These drugs include the thiazides and oth er diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid products, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenytoin, nicotin ic acid, sympathomimetics, calcium channel blocking drugs, and isoniazid. When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving JENTADUETO, th e patient should be closely obser ved to maintain adequate glycemic control [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. When such drugs are withdrawn from a patient receiving JENT ADUETO, the patient should be obs erved closely for hypoglycemia. 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category B JENTADUETO There are no adequate and well controlled studi es in pregnant women with JENTADUETO or its individual components, and some clinical data is available for metformin which indicate that the risk for major malformations was not increased when metformin is taken during the first trime ster in pregnancy. In addition, metformin was not associated with increased perinatal complications. Nevertheless, because these clinical data cannot rule out the possibility of harm, JENTADUETO should be used during pregna ncy only if clearly needed. 7JENTADUETO was not teratogenic when administered to Wistar Han rats during the period of organoge nesis at doses similar to clin ical exposure. At higher maternally toxic doses (9 and 23 times the clinical dose based on exposure), the metformin component of the combination was associated wit h an increased incidence of fetal rib and scapula malformations. Linagliptin Linagliptin was not teratogenic when administered to pregnant Wistar Han rats and Himalayan rabbits during the period of organo genesis at doses up to 240 mg/kg and 150 mg/kg, respectively. These doses represent approximately 943 times the clinical dose in rats and 1943 times the clinical do se in rabbits, based on exposure. No functional, behavioral, or reproductive toxic ity was observed in offspring of female Wi star Han rats when administered linaglip tin from gestation day 6 to lactation day 21 at a dose 49 times the maximum recommended human dose, based on exposure. Linagliptin crosses the placenta into the fetus following oral dosing in pregnant rats and rabbits. Metformin Hydrochloride Metformin has been studied for embryofetal effects in 2 rat strains and in rabbits. Me tformin was not teratogenic in Sprague Da wley rats up to 600 mg/kg or in Wistar Han rats up to 200 mg/kg (2-3 times the clinical dose based on body surface area or exposure, respectively). At higher maternal ly toxic doses (9 and 23 times the clinical dose based on exposure), an increased incidence of rib a nd scapula skeletal malformations was observed in the Wistar H an strain. Metformin was not teratogenic in rabbits at doses up to 140 mg/kg (s imilar to clinical dose based on body surface area). Metformin administered to female Sprague Dawley rats from ge station day 6 to lactation day 21 up to 600 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum clinical dose based on body surface area) had no effect on prenatal or postnatal development of offspring. Metformin crosses the placenta into the fetus in rats and humans. 8.3 Nursing Mothers No studies in lactating animals have been conducted with the co mbined components of JENTADUETO. In studies performed with the individual components, both linagliptin and metformin were secreted in the milk of lactating rats. It is not know n whether linagliptin is excreted in human milk. Metformin is excreted in human milk in low concentrations. Because the potential for hypoglycem ia in nursing infants may exist, a decision should be made whe ther to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account th e importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of JENTADUETO in pediatric patients under 18 years of age have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Linagliptin is minimally excreted by the kidney; however, metformin is substantia lly excreted by the kidney. Considering that a ging can be associated with reduced renal function, JENTADUETO should be used with caution as age increases [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Linagliptin There were 4040 type 2 diabetes patients tr eated with linagliptin 5 mg from 15 clini cal trials of linagliptin; 1085 (27%) patie nts were 65 years and over, while 131 (3%) were 75 years and over. Of these patients, 2566 were enrolle d in 12 double-blind placebo-contro lled studies; (23%) were 65 years and over, while 82 (3%) were 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed be tween patients 65 years and over and younger patients. Therefore, no dose adjustment is recommended in the elderly popul ation. While clinical studies of linaglip tin have not identified differences in r esponse between the elderly and younger patients, greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Metformin Controlled clinical studies of metformin di d not include sufficient numbers of elderly patients to determine whether they respo nd differently from younger patients, although other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in respons es between the elderly and young patients. The initial and maintenance dosing of metformin should be conservative in patient s with advanced age, due to the potential for decreased renal function in this popul ation. Any dose adjustment should be based on a careful assessment of renal function [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.3), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 10 OVERDOSAGE In the event of an overdose with JENTADUETO , contact the Poison Control Center. Employ the usual supportive measures (e.g., re move unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institu te supportive treatment) as dictated by the patient's clinical s tatus. Removal of linagliptin by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is unlikely. However, metformin is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynami c conditions. Therefore, hemodialysis may be useful partly for removal of accumulated me tformin from patients in whom JENTADUETO overdosage is suspected . Linagliptin During controlled clinical trials in healthy subjects, with si ngle doses of up to 600 mg of linagliptin (equivalent to 120 time s the recommended daily dose), there were no dose-related clinical adverse drug reactions. There is no experience with doses above 600 mg in humans. Metformin Overdose of metformin has occurred, including ingestion of amounts greater than 50 grams. Hypoglycemia was reported in approxim ately 10% of cases, but no causal association with metformin has been estab lished. Lactic acidosis has metformin overdose c ases [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 11 DESCRIPTION JENTADUETO tablets contain 2 oral antihyperglycemic drugs used in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus: linagliptin and m etformin hydrochloride.

Following oral administration, plasma concentrations of linag liptin decline in at least a biphasic manner with a long terminal half-life (>100 hour s), related to the saturable binding of linagliptin to DPP-4. However, the prolonged elimination does not contribute to the accumulation of the drug. The effective half-life for accumulation of linagliptin, as determined from oral administration o f multiple doses of linagliptin 5 mg, is approximately 12 hours. After once-daily dosi ng, steady state plasma concentrations of linagliptin 5 mg are reached by the thir d dose, and C max and AUC increased by a factor of 1.3 at steady-state compared with the first dose. Plasma AUC of linagliptin increas ed in a less than dose-proportiona l manner in the dose range of 1 to 10 mg. The pharmacokinetics of linagliptin is similar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes. Metformin The absolute bioavailability of a metformin hydrochloride 500-mg tablet given unde r fasting conditions is approximately 50% to 60%. Studies using single oral doses of metformin tablets 500 mg to 1500 mg, and 850 mg to 2550 mg, indicat e that there is a lack of dose proportionality with increasi ng doses, which is due to decreased absorption rather than an a lteration in elimination. Distribution Linagliptin The mean apparent volume of distribution at steady state following a single intravenous dose of linagliptin 5 mg to healthy subjects is approximately 1110 L, indicating that linagliptin extensivel y distributes to the tissues. Plasma protein bindi ng of linagliptin is concentration-dependent decr easing 1 to 75% to 89% at 30 nmol/L, reflecting saturation of binding to DPP-4 with increasing concentrati on of linagliptin. At high concentrations, wher e DPP-4 is fully saturated, 70% to 80% of linagliptin remains bound to plasma proteins and 20% to 30% is unbound in plasma. Plasma binding is not altered in p atients with renal or hepatic impairment. Metformin The apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of metformin following single oral doses of immediate-release metformin hydrochloride tablets 850 mg averaged 654\u00b1358 L. Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins, in contrast to SUs, which are more than 90% protein bound. Metformin partitions into erythrocytes, most likely as a function of time. At usual clinical doses and dosing schedules of metformin tablets, steady-state plasma concentrations of metf ormin are reached within 24 to 48 hours and are generally <1 mcg/mL. During controlled clinical trials of metformin, maximum metformin plasma levels did not exceed 5 m cg/mL, even at maximum doses. Metabolism Linagliptin Following oral administration, the majority (about 90%) of linag liptin is excreted unchanged, indicating that metabolism represents a minor elimination pathway. A small fraction of absorbed linag liptin is metabolized to a pharmacologically in active metabolite, which shows a steady-state 13.3% relative to linagliptin. Metformin Intravenous studies in normal subjects demonstrate that metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine and does not u ndergo hepatic metabolism (no metabolites have been identified in humans) nor biliary excretion. Excretion Linagliptin Following administration of an oral [14C]linagliptin dose to healthy subj ects, approximately 85% of the administered ra dioactivity was eliminated via the enterohepati c system (80%) or urine (5%) within 4 days of dosing. Renal clearance at steady state was approximately 70 mL/min. Metformin Renal clearance is approximately 3.5 times greater than creatinine cleara nce, which indicates that tubular secretion is the maj or route of metformin elimination. Following oral administration, approximately 90% of the absorbed drug is eliminated via the renal route within the first 24 hou rs, with a plasma elimination half-life of approximately 6.2 hours. In blood, the elimination half-life is approximately 17.6 hours, suggesting that the erythrocyte mass may be a compartment of distribution. Specific Populations Renal Impairment JENTADUETO: Studies characterizing the pharmacokinetics of linagliptin and me tformin after administration of JENTADUETO in renally impaire d patients have not been performed. Since metformin is contraindicated in patients with renal impair ment, use of JENTADUETO is also contraindicated in patients with renal impairment (e.g., serum creatinine 1.5 mg/dL [males] (4) Precautions (5.3)]. Linagliptin: Under steady-state conditions, linagliptin expos ure in patients with mild renal impairment was comparable to healthy subjects. In patients with moderate renal impairment under steady-state conditions, mean exposure of linag liptin increased (AUC ,ss by 71% and C max by 46%) compared with healthy subjects. This increase was not associated with a prolonged accumulation half-life, terminal half-lif e, or an increased accumulation factor. Renal excretion of linagliptin was below 5% of the administered dose and was not affected by decreased renal function. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and severe renal impairment showed steady-state exposure approximately 40% higher than t hat of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and normal renal function (increase in AUC by 42% and C max by 35%). For both type 2 diabetes mellitu s groups, renal excretion was below 7% of the administered dose. Metformin: In patients with decreased renal function (based on measured cr eatinine clearance), the plasma and blood half-life of metformin is prolonged and the renal clearance is decreased in proportion to the decrease in creatinine clearance [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Studies characterizing the me tformin after administration of JENTADUETO in hepatically imp aired patients have not been performed. However, use of metfor min alone in patients with hepa tic impairment has been associated with some cases of lactic acidosis. Therefore, use of JENTADUETO is not recommended in patients with hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] . Linagliptin: In patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A) steady-state exposure (AUC ,ss) of linagliptin was approximately 25% lower and C max,ss was approximately 36% lower than in healthy subjects. In patie nts with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B), AUC ss, of linagliptin was about 14% lower and Cmax,ss was approximately 8% lower than in health y subjects. Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) had compara ble exposure of linagliptin in terms of AUC 0-24 and approximately 23% lower C max compared with healthy subjects. Reductions in the pharmacokinetic parameters seen in patients with hepatic impairment did not result in reductions in DPP-4 inhibition. 10Metformin hydrochloride: No pharmacokinetic studies of been conducted in pa tients with hepatic impairment. Body Mass Index (BMI)/Weight Linagliptin: BMI/Weight had no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of linagliptin based on a population pharmacokinetic an alysis. Gender Linagliptin: Gender had no clinically meaningful eff ect on the pharmacokinetics of linagliptin ba sed on Metformin hydrochloride: Metformin pharmacokinetic paramete rs did not differ significantly between normal subjects and patient s with type 2 diabetes mel litus when analyzed according to gender. Similarly, in controlled clinical studies in patients w ith type 2 diabetes mellitus, the antihyperglycemic effect of metformin was comparable in males and females. Geriatric JENTADUETO: Studies characterizing the pharmacokinetics of linagliptin after administration of JENTADUETO in geriatric patie nts have not been performed. Based on the metformin component, JENTA DUETO treatment should not be initiated in patients 80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Linagliptin: Age did not have a clinically meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of linaglip tin based on a population pharmacokinetic an alysis. Metformin hydrochloride: Limited data from controlled pharmacokinetic studies of metformin in healthy elderly subjects suggest that total plasma clearan ce of metformin is decreased, the half-life is prolonged, and C max is increased, compared with healthy young subjects. From these data, it appears that the change in metformin pharmacokinetics with aging is primaril y accounted for by a change in renal function. Pediatric Studies characterizing the pharmacokinetics of linagliptin and metformin after administration of JENTADUETO in pediatric patien ts have not yet been performed. Race Linagliptin: Race had no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of linagliptin based on available pharmacokinetic data, incl uding subjects of White, Hispanic, Black, and Asian racial groups. Metformin hydrochloride: No studies of metformin pharmacokinetic parameters according to r ace have been performed. In controlled clinical studies of met formin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the antihyperglycemic eff ect was comparable in Caucasians (n=249), Blacks (n=51), and H ispanics (n=24). Drug Interactions Pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies with JENTADUETO have not been performed; how ever, such studies have been conducted wit h the individual components of JENTADUETO (linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride). Linagliptin In vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions Linagliptin is a weak to moderate inhibito r of CYP isozyme CYP3A4, but does not inhibit other CYP isozymes and is not an induce and inhibits P-gp mediated transport of digoxi n at high concentrations. Based on these results and in vivo drug interaction studies, linagliptin is considered unlikely to cause interactions with othe r P-gp substrates at therapeutic concent rations. In vivo Assessment of Drug Interactions Inducers of CYP3A4 or P-gp (e.g., rifampin) decrease exposure to subtherapeutic a nd likely ineffective concentra tions. For patients requiring use of such drugs, an alternative to linagliptin is strongly recommended. In vivo studies indicated evidence of a low propensity fo r causing drug interactions with substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C8, P-gp, and OCT. No dose adjustment of linagliptin is recommended based on results of the described pharm acokinetic studies.

General toxicity studies in rats up to 13 weeks were performed with JENTADUETO. The following data are based on the findings in st udies with linagliptin a nd metformin individually. Linagliptin Linagliptin did not increase the incidence of tumors in male and female rats in a 2-year study at doses of 6, 18, and 60 mg/kg. The highest dose of 60 mg/kg is approximately 418 times the clinical dose of 5 mg/day based on AUC exposure. Linagliptin did not increase the incidence of tumo rs in mice in a 2-year study at doses up to 80 mg/kg (males) and 25 mg/kg (females), or approxima tely 35 and 270 times the clini cal dose based on AUC exposure . Higher doses of linagliptin in female mice (80 mg/kg) increased the incidence of lymphoma at appr oximately 215 times the clinical dose based on AUC exposure. Linagliptin was not mutagenic or clastogenic with or without metabolic activation in th e Ames bacterial mutagenicity assay, a c hromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes, and an in vivo micronucleus assay. In fertility studies in rats, linagliptin had no adverse effects on early embryonic development, mating, fertility, or bearing live young up to the highest dose of 240 mg/kg (approximately 943 times the c linical dose based on AUC exposure). Metformin Hydrochloride Long-term carcinogenicity studies have been performed in rats (dosing duration of 10 4 weeks) and mice (dosing duration of 91 we eks) at doses up to and including 900 mg/kg/day and 1500 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are bot h approximately 4 times the maximum recommended human daily dose of 2000 mg/kg/day based on body surface area comparisons. No ev idence of carcinogenicity with metformin was found in either male or female mice. Similarly , there was no tumorigenic potential observed with metformin in male rats. There was, however, an increased incidence of benign stro mal uterine polyps in female ra ts treated with 900 mg/kg/day. There was no evidence of a mutagenic pot ential of metformin in the following in vitro tests: Ames test ( Salmonella typhimurium ), gene mutation test (mouse lymphoma cells), or chromosomal aberrations test (human lymphocytes). Results in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test were also negative. Fertility of male or female rats was unaff ected by metformin when administered at doses as high as 600 mg/kg/day, which is appr oximately 2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons. 14 CLINICAL STUDIES The coadministration of linagliptin and metf ormin has been studied in patients with ty pe 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately contr olled on diet and exercise and in combination with sulfonylurea. There have been no clinical efficacy studies conducted with JE NTADUETO; however, bioequivalence of JENTADUETO to linagliptin an d metformin coadministered as individual tablets was demonstrated in healthy subjects. 14.1 Initial Combination Therapy with Metformin A total of 791 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and inadequate glyc emic control on diet and exer cise participated 24-week, randomized, double-blind, portion of this placebo-controlled factoria l study designed to assess the efficacy of linagliptin as initial therapy with metfo rmin. Patients on an an tihyperglyce m ic agent (52%) underwent a drug washout period of 4 w eeks' duration. After the washout period a nd after completing a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period, patients inadequate glycemic control 7.0% to were (A1C 7.5% to <11.0%) not on antihyperglycemic agents at study entry (48%) immediately entered the 2-week single-blind placebo run- in period and then were randomized. Randomi zation was stratified by baseline A1C (<8.5% vs 8.5%) and use of a prior oral antidiabetic drug (none vs monothera py). Patients were randomized in a 1:2:2:2:2:2 ratio to eithe r placebo or one of 5 active-treatment arms. Approximately equal numbers of patients were randomized to receive initial therapy with 5 mg of linagliptin once daily, 500 mg or 1000 mg of metformin twice daily, or 2.5 mg of linaglip tin twice daily in combination with 500 mg or 1000 mg of metformin twice daily. Pat ients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the study were treated with sulfony lurea, thiazolidinedione, or insulin rescue therapy. 13Initial therapy with the combination of lin agliptin and metformin provided significant im provements in A1C, and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) compared to placebo, to metformin alone, and to linagliptin alone (Table 6, Figure 1). Th e adjusted mean treatment diffe rence in A1C from baseline to week 24 (LOCF) -0.5% (95% CI - 0.7, 1000 mg twi ce to p<0.0001) for linagliptin 1000 mg twice daily compared to lin agliptin 5 mg once daily; -0.6% f or mg/metformin 500 mg twice daily compared to metformin 500 mg twice daily; and -0 -0.6; p<0.0001) for linagliptin 2.5 mg/metform in 500 mg twice daily compared to linagliptin 5 mg once daily. Lipid effects were generally neutral. No meaningful change in body weight was noted in any of the 6 treatment groups.

Patients already on metformin (n=491) at a dose of at least 1500 mg per day were randomized aft er completing a 2-week, open-label, placebo run-in period. Patients on metformi n and antihyperglycemic agent (n= 207) were randomized after a run-in period of approximately 6 weeks on metformin (at a dose of at least 1500 mg per day) in monotherapy . Patients were randomized to th e addition of either linaglipti n 5 mg or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specifi c glycemic goals during the studies were treated with glimepiride rescue. In combination with metformin, linagliptin provided statistica lly significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared with placebo (Table 7). Rescue glycemic therapy was used in 7.8% of patie nts treated with linagliptin 5 mg and in 18. 9% of patients treated with placebo. A s imilar decrease in body weight was observed for both treatment groups. 15Table 7 Glycemic Parameters in Placebo-Controlled St udy for Linagliptin in Combination with Metformin* Linagliptin 5 mg + Metformin + Metformin A1C (%) Number of patients n=513 n=175 Baseline 8.0 Change from baseline (adj usted mean***) -0.5 0.15 Difference from Number of patients n=495 n=159 Baseline (mean) 169 164 Change from baseline (a djusted mean***) -11 11 Difference from placebo + metformin (adjusted mean) (95% CI) -21 (-27, -15) -- 2-hour PPG (mg/dL) Number of patients n=78 n=21 Baseline (mean) 270 274 Change from baseline (a djusted mean***) -49 18 Difference from placebo + metformin (adjusted mean) (95% CI) -67 (-95, -40) -- * Full analysis population usi ng last observation on study **Linagliptin 5 mg + Metformin, n=485; Placebo + Metformin, n=163. ***HbA1c: ANCOVA model included and nu mber of prior oral OADs as class-effects, as well as baseline HbA1c as continu ous covariates.

Patients being treated with metformin only entered a run-in period of 2 weeks' duration, wh ereas patients pretreated metformin and one additional antihyperglycemic agent entered a run-in treat ment period of 6 weeks' durati on with metformin monotherapy (d ose of 1500 mg per day) and washout of the other agent. After an add itional 2-week placebo run-in period, those w ith (A1C 6.5% to 10%) were randomized 1:1 to the addition of linagliptin 5 mg once daily or glimepiride. Randomization was st ratified by baseline HbA1c (<8.5% vs 8.5%), and the previous use of antidiabetic drugs (metformin alone vs metformin plus one other OAD). Patients r eceiving glimepiride were given an initial dose of 1 mg/day and t hen electively titrated over the next 12 weeks to a maximum dose of 4 mg/day as needed to optimize glycem ic control. Thereafter, the glimepiride dose was to be kept con stant, except for down-titration to prevent hypoglycemia. After 52 weeks and 104 weeks, linagliptin and glimepiride both had reductions from baseline in glimepiride) from a base line mean of 7.7% (Table 8). The mean difference between groups in A1C change from baseline was 0.2% with 2-sided 97.5% confidence interval (0.1%, 0.3%) for the intent-to-treat population using last observation carried forward. These results were consistent with the completers analysis.

Hypoglycemia incidence (%): Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test was performed on the patient population contained in the treated set, to compare the proport ion of patients with hypoglycemic events between patients treated with linagliptin and patients treated with glimepiride. Patients treated with linagliptin had a mean baseline body weight of 86 kg and were observed to have an adjusted mean decrease in body weight of 1.1 kg at 52 weeks and 1.4 kg at 104 weeks. Patients on glimepir ide had a mean baseline body weight of 87 kg and were observed to have an adjusted mean increase from baseline in body weight of 1.4 kg at 52 weeks and 1.3 kg at 104 week s (treatment difference p< 0.0001 for both timepoints). 1614.4 Add-On Combination Therapy with Metformin and a Sulfonylurea A total of 1058 patients with type 2 24-week, randomized , double-blind, study designed to assess the efficacy of linagliptin in combination with a sulfonylurea and metformin. The most common sulf onylureas used by patients in (26%), and metformin were randomized to r eceive linagliptin 5 mg or placebo, each administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific gl ycemic goals during the study we re treated with pioglitazone r escue. Glycemic end points measured included A1C and FPG. In combination with a sulfonylurea and me tformin, linagliptin provided statistically significant improvements in A1C and FPG co mpared with placebo (Table 9). In the entire study population (patients on linagliptin in combination with a sulfonylurea and metformin), a mean reduction from basel ine relative to placebo in A1C of -0.6% and in FPG of -13 mg/dL was seen. Rescue therapy was used in 5. 4% of patients treated with linag liptin 5 mg and in 13% of patie nts treated with placebo. Change from baseline in body weight did not diffe r significantly between the groups.

Randomization was stratified by baseline HbA1c (<8.5% vs 8.5%), renal function impairment status (based on baseline eGFR), and concomitant use of oral antidiabetic drugs (none, metform in only, pioglitazone only, metformin + pi oglitazone). Patients with a baseline A1C of >7 % and <10% were included in the study including 709 patients with renal impairment (eGFR <90 mL/min), most of whom (n=575) were categorized as m ild renal impairment (eGFR 60 to <90 mL/min). Patients entered a 2-week placebo run-in period on basal insulin (e.g., insulin glargine, insulin detemir, or NPH insulin) with or without metf ormin and/or pioglitazone backgroun d therapy. Following the run-in period, patients with inadequate glycemic control were randomized to th e addition of either 5 mg of linagliptin or placebo, administere d once daily. Patients were maintained on a stable dose of insulin prior to enrollment, during the run- in period, and during the first 24 weeks of treatment. Patient s who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the double-blind treatment period were resc ued by increasing background insulin dose. Linagliptin used in combination with insu lin (with or without metformin and/or pi oglitazone), provided statistically significan t improvements in A1C and FPG compared to placebo (Table 10) after 24 weeks of treatment. Th e mean total daily insulin dose at baseline was 42 units for pat ients treated with linagliptin and 40 units for patients treated with placebo. Background baseline diabetes th erapy included use of: insulin alone (16.1%), insulin combi ned with metformin only (75.5%), insulin combined with metformin and pioglitazone (7.4%), and insulin combined with pioglitazone only (1%). The mean change from baseli ne to Week 24 in the daily dose of insulin was +1.3 IU in the placebo group and +0.6 IU in the linagliptin group. The mean change in body weight from baseline to Week 24 was similar in the two treatment groups. The rate of hypoglycemia, defined as all sympto matic or asymptomatic episodes with a self measured blood gluc ose was also similar in both groups (21.4% linagliptin; 22.9% placebo) in the first 24 weeks of the study.

FPG: ANCOVA model included treatment, cat egorical renal function impairme nt status and concomitant OAD s as class-effects, as well as baseline HbA1c and baseline FPG as continuous covariates. The difference between treatment with linaglip tin and placebo in terms of adjusted mean change from baseline in HbA1c after 24 weeks was comparable for patients with no renal impairment (eGRF 90 mL/min, n=539), with mild renal impairment (eGFR 60 to <90 mL/min, n=565), or with (eGFR 30 to <60 mL/min, n=124). 1714.6 Renal Impairment A total of 133 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a 52 week, double-blind, randomi zed, placebo-controlled trial desi gned to evaluate the efficacy and safety of linagliptin in patients with both type 2 diabetes and severe chronic renal impairment. Participants with an estimated (based o n the four variables modified diet in renal disease [MDRD] equation) GFR value of <30 mL/min were eligible to participate in the study. Randomization was stratified by ba seline HbA1c ( 8% and >8%) and background antidiabetic therapy (insulin or any combination with insulin, SU or glinides as monotherapy and pioglitazone or any other antidiabetics excluding any other DPP-4 inhibitors). For the initial 12 weeks of the study, background antidiabetic therapy was kept stable and included i nsulin, sulfonylurea, glinides, and pioglitazone. For the remainder of the trial, dose adjustments in antidiabetic background therapy were allowed. At baseline i n this trial, 62.5% of patients were receiving insulin alone as background diabetes ther apy, and 12.5% were recei ving sulfonylurea alone. After 12 weeks of treatment, linag liptin 5 mg provided statistically significant impr ovement in A1C compared to placebo, with a n adjusted mean change of -0.6% compared to placebo (95% confidence interval -0.9, -0.3) based on the analysis using last observation carried forward (LOCF). W ith adjustments in antidiabetic background therapy after the initial 12 weeks, efficacy was maintained for 52 weeks, with an adjusted mean change from baseline in A1C of -0.7% compared to placebo (95% confidence interval -1.0, -0 .4) based on analysis using LOCF. 16 HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING JENTADUETO (linagliptin and metformin hydrochlorid e) tablets 2.5 mg/500 mg are supplied as follows: Bottles of 60 (NDC e) tablets 2.5 are supplied as follows: Bottles of 60 (NDC e) tablets 2.5 are supplied as follows: Bottles of 60 (NDC 0597-0148-60) Bottles of 180 (NDC 0597-0148-18) Storage (59\u00b0-86\u00b0F) [see USP Controlled Room Temperature].

Store in a safe place out of reach of children. 17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION See FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide) 17.1 Instructions Inform patients of the potential risks and benefits of JENTADUETO and of alternative modes of ther apy. Also inform patients ab out the importance of adherence to dietary instructions, regular physical ac tivity, periodic blood glucose monitoring and A1C testing, recognition and management of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, and assessment for diabetes complications. Advise patients to seek medical advice prom ptly during periods of stress such as fev er, trauma, infection, or surgery, as medication requirements may change. Inform patients of the risks of lactic ac idosis due to the metformin component, its symptoms, and conditions that predispose to its development [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Advise patients to discontinue JENTADUETO immediately and to notify their doctor promptly if unexplained hyperventilation, ma laise, myalgia, unusual somnolence, slow or irregular heart beat, sensation of feeling cold (especial ly in the extremities), or other nonspecif ic symptoms occur. GI symptoms are common during initiation of metformin treatment and may occur during initiation of JENTAD UETO therapy; however, advise patients to consult thei r doctor if they develop unexplained symptoms. Although GI symptoms that occur af ter stabilization are unlikely to be drug related, such an occu rrence of symptoms should be evaluated to determine if it may be due to metformin-induced lactic acidosis or other serious disease. Inform patients that the risk of hypoglycemia is increased when JE NTADUETO is used in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea), and that a lower dose of the insulin secretagogue may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. Inform patients that acute pancreatitis ha s been reported during postmarketing use of linagliptin. Inform patients that persis tent severe abdominal pain, sometimes radiating to the back, which may or may not be accompanied by vo miting, is the hallmark symptom of acute pancreatitis. Instruc t patients to discontinue JENTADUETO promptly and contact their physician if persistent severe abdominal pain occurs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . Instruct patients to take JENTADUETO only as prescribed. If a dose is missed, advise patients not to double their next dose. Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake, e ither acute or chronic, while receiving JENTADUETO [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. In form patients about the importa nce of regular testing of renal function and he matological parameters when receiving treatment with JENTADUETO. Instruct patients to read the Medication Gu ide before starting JENTADUETO therapy and to reread each time the prescription is r enewed. Instruct patients to inform their doctor if they develop any bothersome or unusual symptom, or if any symptom persists or worsens. 17.2 Laboratory Tests Inform patients that response to all diabetic therapies should be monitored by periodic measurements of blood glucose and A1C l evels, with a goal of decreasing these levels toward the normal range. A1C monitoring is especia lly useful for evaluating long- term glycemic control. Initial and periodic monitoring of hematologic parameters (e.g ., hemoglobin/hematocrit and re d blood cell indices) and renal fu nction (serum creatinine) should be performed, at least on an annual basis.

Pioglitazone Tablets Generic Name: pioglitazone hydrochloride Dosage Form: tablet BOXED WARNING Thiazolidinediones, including pioglitazone hydrochloride, cause or exacerbate congestive heart failure in some patients [see Warnings and Precautions( 5.1)]. After initiation of pioglitazone hydrochloride, and after dose increases, monitor patients carefully for signs and symptoms of heart failure(e.g., excessive, rapid weight gain, dyspnea, and/or edema). If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care and discontinuation or dose reduction of pioglitazone tablets must be considered. Pioglitazone hydrochloride is not recommended in patients with symptomatic heart failure. Initiation of Pioglitazone Tablets in patients with established New York Heart Association(NYHA)Class III or IV heart failure is contraindicated [see Contraindications( 4)and Warnings and Precautions( 5.1)]. INDICATIONS & USAGE Monotherapy and Combination Therapy Pioglitazone Tablets USP are indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus in multiple clinical settings [see Clinical Studies ( 14)]. Important Limitation of Use Pioglitazone Tablets USP exerts its antihyperglycemic effect only in the presence of endogenous insulin. Pioglitazone Tablets USP should not be used to treat type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis, as it would not be effective in these settings. Use caution in patients with liver disease [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3)]. DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION Recommendations for all patients Pioglitazone tablets should be taken once daily and can be taken without regard to meals. The recommended starting dose for patients without congestive heart failure is 15 mg or 30 mg once daily. The recommended starting dose for patients with congestive heart failure (NYHA Class I or II) is 15 mg once daily. The dose can be titrated in increments of 15 mg up to a maximum of 45 mg once daily based on glycemic response as determined by HbA1c. After initiation of pioglitazone hydrochloride or with dose increase, monitor patients carefully for adverse reactions related to fluid retention such as weight gain, edema, and signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( total bilirubin) should be obtained prior to initiating Pioglitazone Tablets. Routine periodic monitoring of liver tests during treatment with Pioglitazone Tablets is not recommended in patients without liver disease. Patients who have liver test abnormalities prior to initiation of pioglitazone hydrochloride or who are found to have abnormal liver tests while taking Pioglitazone Tablets should be managed as described under Warnings and Precautions [see Warnings andPrecautions (5.3) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)]. Concomitant use with an insulin secretagogue or insulin If hypoglycemia occurs in a patient co- administered pioglitazone hydrochloride and an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea), the dose of the insulin secretagogue should be reduced. If hypoglycemia occurs in a patient co -administered pioglitazone hydrochloride and insulin, the dose of insulin should be decreased by 10% to 25%. Further adjustments to the insulin dose should be individualized based on glycemic response Coadministration with strong CYP2C8 inhibitors Coad gemfibrozil, a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, increases pioglitazone exposure approximately 3- fold. Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of pioglitazone tablet is 15 mg daily when used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)]. DOSAGE FORMS & STRENGTHS Round tablet contains pioglitazone as follows: 15 mg: White to off white, circular, flat face, bevelled edge, uncoated tablet debossed with \"ML 86\" on one side and plain on the other side 30 mg: White to off white, circular, flat face, bevelled edge, uncoated tablet debossed with \"ML 87\" on one side and plain on the other side 45 mg: White to off white, circular, flat face, bevelled edge, uncoated tablet debossed with \"ML 91\" on one side and plain on the other side Contraindications Do not initiate in patients with NYHA Class III or IV heart failure [see Boxed Warning].Do not use in patients with a history of a serious hypersensitivity reaction to Pioglitazone Tablets or any of its ingredients. Warnings and Precautions Congestive Heart Failure Pioglitazone hydrochloride, like other thiazolidinediones, can cause dose- related fluid retention when used alone or in combination with other antidiabetic medications and is most common when pioglitazone hydrochloride is used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate congestive heart failure. Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure. If congestive heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care and discontinuation or dose reduction of Pioglitazone Tablets must be considered [see Boxed Warning , Contraindications ( 4), and Adverse Reactions ( 6.1)]. Edema In controlled clinical trials, edema was reported more frequently in patients treated with Pioglitazone Tablets than in placebo- treated patients and is dose- related [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1)]. In postmarketing experience, reports of new onset or worsening edema have been received. Pioglitazone hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with edema. Because thiazolidinediones, including pioglitazone hydrochloride, can cause fluid retention, which can exacerbate or lead to congestive heart failure, pioglitazone hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients at risk for congestive heart failure. Patients treated with Pioglitazone Tablets should be monitored for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1) and Patient Counseling Information ( 17.1)]. Hepatic Effects There have been postmarketing reports of fatal and non- fatal hepatic failure in patients taking pioglitazone tables, although the reports contain insufficient information necessary to establish the probable cause. There has been no evidence of drug - induc ed hepatotoxicity in the pioglitazone hydrochloride controlled clinical trial database to date [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1)]. Patients with type 2 diabetes may have fatty liver disease or cardiac disease with episodic congestive heart failure, both of which may cause liver test abnormalities, and they may also have other forms of liver disease, many of which can be treated or managed. Therefore, obtaining a liv er the patient is recommended before initiating Pioglitazone Tablets therapy. In patients with abnormal liver tests, pioglitazone hydrochloride should be initiated with caution. Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice. In this clin ical context, if the patient is found to have abnormal liver tests (ALT greater than 3 times the upper limit of the reference range), pioglitazone hydrochloride treatment should be interrupted and investigation done to establish the probable cause. Pioglit azone Tablets should not be restarted in these patients without another explanation for the liver test abnormalities. Patients who have serum ALT greater than three times the reference range with serum total bilirubin greater than two times the reference range without alternative etiologies are at risk for severe drug -induced liver injury, and should not be restarted on Pioglitazone Tablets. For patients with lesser elevations of serum ALT or bilirubin and with an alternate probable cause, treatment with Pioglitazone Tablets can be used with caution. Fractures In PROactive (the Prospective Pioglitazone Clinical Trial in Macrovascular Events), 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes and a history of macrovascular disease were randomized to Pioglitazone Tablets (N=2605), force- titrated up to 45 mg daily or placebo (N=2633) in addition to standard of care. During a mean follow -up of 34.5 months, the incidence of bone fracture in females was 5.1% (44/870) for Pioglitazone Tablets versus 2.5% (23/905) for placebo. This difference was noted after the first year of treatment and persisted during the course of the study. The majority of fractures observed in female patients were nonvertebral fractures including lower limb and distal upper limb. No increase in the incidence of fracture was observed in men treated with Pioglitazone Tablets (1.7%) versus placebo (2.1%). The risk of fracture should be considered in the care of patients, especially female patients, treated with Pioglitazone Tablets and attention should be given to assessing and maintaining bone health according to current standards of care. Urinary Bladder Tumors Tumors were observed in the urinary bladder of male rats in the two- year carcinogenicity study [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1)]. In two 3 -year trials in which pioglitazone hydrochloride was compared to placebo or glyburide, there were 16/3656 (0.44%) reports of bladder cancer in patients taking pioglitazone hydrochloride compared to 5/3679 (0.14%) in patients not taking pioglitazone hydrochloride. After excluding patients in whom exposure to study drug was less than one year at the time of diagnosis of bladder cancer, there were six (0.16%) cases on pioglitazone hydrochloride and two (0.05%) cases on placebo. A five -year interim report of an ongoing 10- year observational cohort study found a non- significant increase in the risk for bladder cancer in subjects ever exposed to pioglitazone hydrochloride, compared to subjects never exposed to pioglitazone hydrochloride (HR 1.2 [95% CI 0.9 - 1.5]). Compared to never exposure, a duration of pioglitazone hydrochloride therapy longer than 12 months was associated with an increase in risk (HR 1.4 [95% CI 0.9 - 2.1]), which reached statistical significance after more than 24 months of pioglitazone hydrochloride use (HR 1.4 [95% CI 1.03 - 2.0]). Interim results from this study suggested that taking pioglitazone hydrochloride longer than 12 months increased the relative risk of developing bladder cancer in any given year by 40% which equates to an absolute increase of 3 cases in 10,000 (from approximately 7 in 10,000 [without pioglitazone hydrochloride] to approximately 10 in 10,000 [with pioglitazone hydrochloride]). There are insufficient data to determine whether pioglitazone is a tumor promoter for urinary bladder tumors. Consequently, pioglitazone hydrochloride should not be used in patients with active bladder cancer and the benefits of glycemic control versus unknown risks for cancer recurrence with pioglitazone hydrochloride should be considered in patients with a prior history of bladder cancer. Hypoglycemia Patients receiving pioglitazone hydrochloride in combination with insulin or other anti - diabetic medications (particularly insulin secretagogues such as sulfonylureas) may be at risk for hypoglycemia. A reduction in the dose of the concomitant anti -diabetic medication may be necessary to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2)]. Macular Edema Macular edema has been reported in postmarketing experience in diabetic patients who were taking pioglitazone hydrochloride or another thiazolidinedione. Some patients presented with blurred vision or decreased visual acuity, but others were diagnosed on routine ophthalmologic examination. Most patients had peripheral edema at the time macular edema was diagnosed. Some patients had improvement in their macular edema after discontinuation of the thiazolidinedione. Patients with diabetes should have regular eye exams by an ophthalmologist according to current standards of care. Patients with diabetes who report any visual symptoms should be promptly referred to an ophthalmologist, regardless of the patient's underlying medications or other physical findings [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1)]. Ovulation Therapy with pioglitazone hydrochloride, like other thiazolidinediones, may result in ovulation in some premenopausal anovulatory women. As a result, these patients may be at an increased risk for pregnancy while taking Pioglitazone Tablets [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1)]. This effect has not been investigated in clinical trials, so the frequency of this occurrence is not known. Adequate contraception in all premenopausal women treated with pioglitazone tablet is recommended. Macrovascular Outcomes There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with pioglitazone hydrochloride or any other anti -diabetic drug. Adverse Reactions The following serious adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Congestive heart failure [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1)] Edema [see Warnings and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4)] Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in pr actice. Page 1 of 5 MEDICATION GUIDE OSENI (OH -senn-ee) (alogliptin and pioglitazone) tablets Read this Medication Guide carefully before you start taking OSENI and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking w ith your doctor about your medical condition or your treatment. If you have any questions about OSENI, ask your doctor or pharmacist. What is the most important information I should know about OSENI? OSENI can cause serious si de effects, including: 1. New or worse heart fail ure: Pioglitazone, one of the medicines in OSENI, can cause your body to keep extra fluid (fluid retention), which leads to swelling (edema) and weight gain. Extra body fluid can make some heart problems worse or lead to heart failure. Hear t failure means your heart does not pump blood well enough. Do not take OSENI if you have severe heart failure. If you have heart failure with symptoms (such as shortness of breath or swelling), even if these symptoms are not severe, OSENI may not be right for you. Call your doctor right away if you have any of the following: swelling or fluid retention, especially in the ankles or legs shortness of breath or trouble breathing, especially when you lie down an unusually fast increase in weight unusual tiredness 2. Inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis): Alogliptin, one of the medicines in OSENI, may cause pancreatitis , which may be severe. Certain medical conditions make you more likely to get pancreatitis. Before you start taking OSENI: Tell your doctor if you have ever had: pancreatitis stones in your gallbladder (gallstones) a history of alcoholism kidney problems liver problems Stop taking OSENI and call your doctor right away if you have pain in your stomach area (abdomen) that is severe and will not go away. The pain may be felt going from your abdomen through to your back. The pain may happen with or without vomiting. These may be symptoms of pancreatitis. Page 2 of 5 What is OSENI?

How It Works Sulfonylurea medicines increase the amount of insulin produced by the pancreas , and insulin lowers blood sugar. Why It Is Used Sulfonylurea medicines are prescribed for people with type 2 diabetes when eating healthy foods, weight loss, and exercise do not keep the blood sugar level within a target range. They are helpful for people who cannot make enough insulin or who have become resistant to the insulin the body makes. These medicines can help control blood sugar levels in children and young adults who have type 2 diabetes and are overweight . How Well It Works Type 2 diabetes is a disease that can get worse over time, so medicines may need to change. Diabetes medicines work best for people who are being active and eating healthy foods. Studies have suggested that sulfonylureas lower hemoglobin A1c by 1% to 2%.1 Side Effects All medicines have side effects. But many people don't feel the side effects, or they are able to deal with them. Ask your pharmacist about the side effects of each medicine you take. Side effects are also listed in the information that comes with your medicine. Here are some important things to think about: Usually the benefits of the medicine are more important than any minor side effects. Side effects may go away after you take the medicine for a while. If side effects still bother you and you wonder if you should keep taking the medicine, call your doctor . He or she may be able to lower your dose or change your medicine. Do not suddenly quit taking your medicine unless your doctor tells you to. Call911or other emergency services right away if you have: Trouble breathing. Hives . Swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat. Call your doctor if you have: Seizures . Common side effects of this medicine include: Signs of low blood sugar (sweating, feeling nervous, dizziness , and/or confusion). Hunger . Weight gain. See Drug Reference for a full list of side effects. (Drug Reference is not available in all systems.) What To Think About Sulfonylurea medicines increase insulin levels even if you have not eaten food. Watch for symptoms of low blood sugar, especially if you drink alc ohol. People with kidney or liver problems might not be able to take sulfonylurea medicines. Skin can be more easily sunburned when taking tolbutamide or tolazamide. Chlorpropamide can cause a skin rash. Taking medicine Medicine is one of the many tools your doctor has to treat a health problem. Taking medicine as your doctor suggests will improve your health and may prevent future problems. If you don't take your medicines properly, you may be putting your health (and perhaps your life) at risk. There are many reasons why people have trouble taking their medicine. But in most cases, there is something you can do. For suggestions on how to work around common problems, see the topic Taking Medicines as Prescribed. Advice for women If you are pregnant , breast -feeding, or planning to get pregnant, do not use any medicines unless your doctor tells you to. Some medicines can harm your baby. This includes prescription and over -the-counter medicines, vitamins, herbs, and supplements . And make sure that all your doctors know that you are pregnant, breast -feeding, or planning to get pregnant. Checkups Follow -up care is a key part of your treatment and safety. Be sure to make and go to all appointments, and call your doctor if you are having problems. It's also a good idea to know your test results and keep a list of the medicines you take. Sulfonylurea medicines are an effective treatment for many people who have type 2 diabetes. If one of these medicines keeps your blood sugar within a target range, your risks of long- term complications of diabetes can be reduced. Other important factors that contribute to complications include high blood pressure, being overweight, high cholesterol levels, and smoking .

The Phase 3 clinical program evaluated the safety and of inv estigational canagliflozin across the spectrum of type 2 diabetes management, from adult patients treated only with diet and exercise to those requiring insulin injections to maintain glycemic control, and in three large studies in special populations: older patients with type 2 diabetes, patients with type 2 diabetes who had moderate renal impairment, and patients with type 2 diabetes who had or were at high risk for cardiovascular disease. CANTATA (CANagliflozi n Treatment And Trial Analysis) includes multiple studies assessing the glucose-lowering and safety of canagliflozin in adult patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes failing to achieve glycemic control on diet and exercise and on the background of a var iety of commonly used oral antihyperglycemic agents or insulin. CANVAS (CAN cardio Vascular Assessment Study) assesses the general safety , tolerabilit y and cardiov ascular safety of canagliflozin in approximately 4,330 adult patients with type 2 diabetes, who also hav e either a history or high risk of cardiovascular disease.Media Fact Sheet: Canagliflozin Phase 3 Program FAST FACTS The global Phase 3 program evaluated the safety and efficacy of investigational antihyperglycemic agent canagliflozin, a selective sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, and enrolled 10,285 patients in nine studies. The trials assessed the safety and efficacy of canagliflozin dosed at 100 or 300 mg once daily, when used as monotherapy and in combination with oral antihyperglycemic agents, and in combination with insulin with or without oral antihyperglycemic agents.Phase 3 Clinical Development Program: 9 Studies Conducted DIA3015 Combo with metformin/ sulfonylurea vs. sitagliptin 52 weeks 756 patients (randomized) 2 treatment arms: canagliflozin 300 mg, sitagliptin arms: canagliflozin mg, canagliflozin 300 mg, 100 mg, placebo DIA3002 Combo with metformin/ sulfonylurea 26/26 weeks 469 patients (randomized) 100 mg, canagliflozin 300 mg, 26/26 weeks patients (randomized) 3 treatment arms: canagliflozin 100 mg, canagliflozin 300 mg and placeboDIA3012 Combo with metformin/ pioglitazone 26/26 weeks 344 patients (randomized) treatment controlPlacebo controlSpecial DIA3004 Moderate weeks patients (randomized) 3 treatment arms: canagliflozin 100 mg, canagliflozin 300 mg, placeboDIA3010 Older subjects - bone safety & body comp 26/78 weeks 716 patients (randomized) 3 treatment arms: canagliflozin 100 mg, canagliflozin 300 mg, placeboDIA3008 (CANVAS) CV study Event-driven, up to 9 years in duration 4330 patients (randomized) 3 treatment arms: canagliflozin 100 mg, canagliflozin 300 mg, placebo FEBRUARY 2013 \u00a9 Janssen Research & LLC, SGLT2 Cotransporter Inhibitors in Challenging T2DM Patients Frequently Asked Questions How do SGLT2 inhibitors work to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)? SGLT2 inhibitors hinder glucose reabsorption in the proximal renal tubules, lowering blood glucose independent of insulin. What is the effect of the SGLT2 inhibitor class on blood pressure? SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to lower systolic and di astolic blood pressure. These reductions may be a result of diuresis and body weight changes associated with SGLT2 inhibitors. What is the recommended dosing for the two FDA-approved SGLT2 inhibitors? Canagliflozin is initially dosed at 100 mg once daily and can be increased to 300 mg once daily in patients who require additional glycemic control. For dapagliflozin, the recommend ed starting dose is 5 mg once daily, taken in the morning, with or without food. This dose can be increased to 10 mg once daily for patients who require additional glycemic control. What is the average reduction in A1C seen in patients on an SGLT2 inhibitor? When used in monotherapy, SGLT2 inhibitors can reduce A1 C from 0.5% to 0.9%, with the response usually dependent on baseline A1C. What are the effects of SGLT2 therapy in patients taking insulin? When added to insulin therapy, SGLT2 inhibitors have reduced A1C and weight. What effects on weight have been seen with the SGLT2 inhibitors? Glycosuria resulting from SGLT2 therapy is associated with a net caloric loss of approximately 200 to 300 kcal daily with statistically significant weight loss, when compared with placebo. What effects on lipids have been reported with SGLT2 inhibitors? Dose-related increases in LDL-C can occur with canafliflozin and dapagliflozin, and small increases in non-HDL-C can also occur with canagliflozin. Increases in HDL-C have also been noted with both agents. The cardiovascular significance of these changes is currently unknown and being assessed in long-term trials. Have SGLT2 inhibitors been evaluated in patients 65 years and older? In this patient population, a higher incidence of adverse e ffects related to reduced intravascular volume and smaller reductions in A1C have been reported , compared with younger individuals. Should SGLT2 inhibitors be used in pati ents with moderate renal impairment? Canagliflozin is not recommended for estimated glomerular filtration rates mL/min/1.73m 2 and is contraindicated for eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73m2, while dosage should not be increased above 100 mg daily if eGFR is between 45 and 60 mL/min/1.73m2. Dapagliflozin is not recommended if eGFR is <60 mL/min/1.73m2. What are the effects on infe ctions in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors? Dose-related increases in genital mycotic infections have been reported in both men and women taking SGLT2 inhibitors. In men, these infections are associat ed with balanitis or balanoposthitis. What effects on serum potassium have been repo rted in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors? Dose-related, transient mean increases in serum potassium have been reported early after initiation of therapy, usually in patients with elevated potassium or renal impairment at baseline, or in patients using potassium-sparing diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors , and angiotension receptor blockers. How should SGLT2 inhibitors be used for patients with T2DM? SGLT2 inhibitors can be used as initial monotherapy and in combination with oral agents and/or insulin in patients with T2DM as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control. These medications are contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment or end-st age renal disease and patients on dialysis. INVOKANA cannagliflozin Canagliflozin is a sodium glucose co- transporter 2, (SGLT2) inhibitor for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes. The kidneys of people with type 2diabetes reabsorb greater amounts of glucose back into the body compared to non-diabetic people, which may contribute to elevated glucose levels. Canagliflozin blocks the reabsorption of glucose by the kidney, increasing glucose excretion and lowering blood glucose levels. Type 2 diabetes is a chronic condition that over time may require the use of combinations of antihyperglycemic agents, including insulin, to maintain optimal glycemic control which is a primary goal of treatment. Canagliflozin has the potential to be administered as monotherapy in patients who are inadequately controlled with diet and exercise alone, as an add- on therapy in patients being treated with metformin alone or in combination with sulfonylureas, and in patients with moderate renal impairment. CONTRAINDICATIONS History of a serious hypersensitivity reaction to INVOKANA. Severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2), end stage renal disease, or patients on dialysis. WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS Hypotension: INVOKANA causes intravascular volume cont raction. Symptomatic hypotension can occur after initiating INVOKANA, particularly in patients with impaired renal function (eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2), elderly patients, and patients on either diuretics or medications that interfere with the renin-angiotensin with low systolic blood pressure. Before initiating INVOKANA in patients with one or more of these characteristics , volume status should be assessed and corrected. Monitor for signs and symptoms after initiating therapy. Impairment in Renal Function: INVOKANA increases serum creatinine and decreases eGFR. Patients with hypovolemia may be more susceptible to these changes. Renal function abnormalities can occur after initiating INVOKANA. More frequent renal function monitoring is recommended in patients with an eGFR below 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Hyperkalemia: INVOKANA can lead to hyperkalemia. Patients with moderate renal impairment who are taking medications that interfere with potassium excretion, such as potassium- sparing diuretics, or medications that interfere with the renin -angiotensin-aldosterone system are more likely to develop hyperkalemia. Monitor serum potassium levels periodically after initiating INVOKANA in patients with impaired renal function and in patients predisposed to hyperkalemia due to medications or other medical conditions. Hypoglycemia With Concomitant Use With Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues: Insulin and insulin secretagogues are known to cause hypoglycemia. INVOKANA can increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with INVOKANA. Genital Mycotic Infections: INVOKANA increases the risk of genital mycotic infections. Patients with a history of genital mycotic infections and uncircumcised males were more likely to develop genital mycotic infections. Monitor and treat appropriately. Hypersensitivity Reactions: Hypersensitivity reactions (eg, generalized urticaria), some serious, were reported with INVOKANA treatment; these reactions generally occurred within hours to days after initiating INVOKANA. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue use of INVOKANA; treat per standard of care and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve. Increases in Low -Density Lipoprotein (LDL- C): Dose-related increases in LDL -C occur with INVOKANA. Monitor LDL -C and treat per standard of care after initiating INVOKANA. Macrovascular Outcomes: There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with INVOKANA or any other antidiabetic drug. INTERACTIONS enzymes, UGT1A9, decreased canagliflozin area under the curve (AUC) by 51%. This decrease in exp osure to canagliflozin may decrease UGTs (eg, rifampin, co- administered with INVOKANA (canagliflozin), consider increasing the dose to 300 mg once daily if patients are currently tolerating INVOKANA 100 mg once daily, have an eGFR greater than 60mL/min/1.73 m2, and require additional glycemic control. Consider other antihyperglycemic therapy in patients with an eGFR of 45 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 receiving concurrent therapy with a UGT inducer and requiring additional glycemic control. Digoxin: There was an increase in the area AUC and mean peak drug concentration (C max) of digoxin (20% and 36%, respectively) when co-administered with INVOKANA 300 mg. Patients taking INVOK ANA with concomitant digoxin should be monitored appropriately. USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy Category C: Not for use in pregnancy, nursing mothers or in pediatric patients. Renal Impairment: The efficacy and safety of INVOKANA were evaluated in a study that included patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to < 50 mL/min/1.73 m2). These patients had less overall glycemic efficacy and had a higher occurrence of adverse reactions related to reduced intravascular volume, renal -related adverse reactions, and decreases in eGFR compared to patients with mild renal impairment or normal renal function (eGFR 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2); patients treated with INVOKANA 300 mg were more likely to experience increases in potassium. The efficacy and safety of INVOKANA have not been established in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/ 1.73 m 2), with end- stage renal disease (ESRD), or receiving dialysis. INVOKANA is not expected to be effective in these patient populations. Hepatic Impairm ent: No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. The use of INVOKANA has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment and it is therefore not recommended. OVERDOSAGE There were no reports of overdose during the clinical development program of INVOKANA (canagliflozin). In the event of an overdose, contact the Poison Control Center. It is also reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures, eg, remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointesti nal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive treatment as dictated by the patient's clinical status. Canagliflozin was negligibly removed during a 4-hour hemodialysis session. Canagliflozin is not expected to be dialyzable by peritoneal dialysis. ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common (5%) adverse reactions were female genital mycotic infections, urinary tract infections, and increased urination. Adverse reactions in 2% of patients were male genital mycotic infections, vulvovaginal pruritus, thirst, nausea, and constipation. Your Physician Prescribed Welchol? Welchol\u00ae (colesevelam HCl) is a prescription medication that, along with diet and exercise, can be used to improve blood glucose control in adults with type 2 diabetes who are on certain other anti- diabetic medications for blood glucose. Welchol can also be used along with diet and exercise for people whose LDL-C, the \"bad\" cholesterol, is too high. Your physician may prescribe Welchol together with certain other type 2 diabetes medicines to help control blood glucose. When added to metformin, a sulfonylurea, or insulin, Welchol further reduces blood glucose levels. Welchol can also be prescribed alone or with other cholesterol- lowering medications to lower LDL-C. When used with a statin, Welchol helps lower LDL- C more than a statin alone. How to Take Welchol Welchol\u00ae (colesevelam HCl) should be taken as directed by your physician. Welchol is dosed at 6 tablets per day (either as 3 tablets twice daily, or 6 tablets once daily, taken with meals and a liquid). Although 6 pills may seem like a lot, keep in mind that Welchol is a safe way to effectively lower your blood glucose and/or bad cholesterol. Unlike other type 2 diabetes or cholesterol medications, Welchol does not enter your bloodstream. Your liver or kidneys are not needed to make Welchol work or to remove Welchol from your body. Taking Welchol as prescribed by your physician gives you an opportunity to help reach your blood glucose and/or LDL- C goal Important Information About Welchol Welchol lowers LDL or \"bad \" cholesterol along with diet and exercise. It can be taken alone or with other cholesterol-lowering medications known as statins. Welchol, along with diet and exercise, also lowers blood sugar levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus when added to other antidiabetic medications (metformin, sulfonylureas, or insulin). Ask your doctor if Welchol is right for you. Welchol is not for everyone, especially those with intestinal blockage, those with blood triglyceride levels of greater than 500 mg/dL, or a history of pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) due to high triglyceride levels. Welchol has not been shown to prevent heart disease or heart attacks. Tell your doctor if you have high triglycerides (greater than 300 mg/dL). Tell your doctor if you have stomach or intestinal problems, including gastroparesis (when the stomach takes too long to empty its contents), abnormal contractions of the digestive system, major gastrointestinal tract surgery, if you have trouble swallowing, or if you have vitamin A, D, E, or K deficiencies. Welchol has known interactions with glyburide (a drug for diabetes), levothyroxine (a drug used to treat an underactive thyroid) and certain oral contraceptives. Welchol has not been studied with all combinations of drugs and supplements. Please tell your doctor about all medications and supplements you may be taking before beginning Welchol, as your doctor may tell you to take your other medications and supplements 4 hours before taking Welchol. Remember to tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding. In patients with high LDL (\"bad\" cholesterol) side effects that occurred greater than placebo (a \"sugar\" pill) were constipation (11.0% vs. 7.0%), indigestion vs. runny vs. 3.1%) and muscle aches (2.1% vs. 0.4%). In patients with Type 2 Diabetes side effects that occurred greater than placebo were constipation (8.7% vs. 2.0%), inflamed nasal 1.4%), low blood sugar (3.0% vs. 2.3%), nausea (3.0% vs. 1.4%) and high blood pressure (2.8% vs. 1.6%).

Talk to your doctor for more information about your specific condition. How BYETTA Works In people with type 2 diabetes , high blood sugar (glucose ) is a big concern. After a meal, blood sugar levels rise, often too high. BYETTA slows down the rate at which glucose enters the bloodstream. BYETTA signals the pancreas to make the right amount of insulin at the right time to help blood sugar remain closer to normal. After blood sugar levels off, BYETTA stops signaling the pancreas to produce insulin. This effect helps the body avoid low blood sugar, too (called hypoglyc emia ). As a result, BYETTA may help reduce your high blood sugar levels throughout the day. And that can mean better control, which can be one of the keys to helping manage your diabetes. BYETTA is not insulin and should not be taken instead of insulin. BYETTA actually helps your body make more of its own insulin. When used with a diet and exercise program, BYETTA can help keep your blood sugar under control in at least four ways: Indication BYETTA is an injectable prescription medicine that may improve blood sugar (glucose) control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus, when used with a diet and exercise program. BYETTA is not insulin and should not be taken instead of insulin. BYETTA can be used with Lantus\u00ae (insulin glargine), which is a long -acting insulin, but should not be taken with short - and/or rapid-acting insulin. BYETTA is not for people with type 1 diabetes or people with diabetic ketoacidosis. Important Safety Information for BYETTA\u00ae (exenatide) i njection Serious side effects can happen in people who take BYETTA, including inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) which may be severe and lead to death. Before taking BYETTA, tell your healthcare provider if you have had pancreatitis, stones in your gallbladder (gallstones), a history of alcoholism, or high blood triglyceride levels. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have pain in your stomach area (abdomen) that is severe, and will not go away. The pain may happen with or without vomit ing and may be felt going from your abdomen through to your back. Your risk for getting low blood sugar is higher if you take BYETTA with another medicine that can cause low blood sugar, such as a sulfonylurea or insulin. The dose of your sulfonylurea or insulin medicine may need to be lowered while you use BYETTA. BYETTA should not be used in people who have severe kidney problems and should be used with caution in people who have had a kidney transplant. BYETTA may cause new or worse problems with kidney function, including kidney failure. Before you use BYETTA, tell your healthcare provider if you have severe problems with your stomach, such as delayed emptying of your stomach (gastroparesis) or problems with digesting food. Do not use BYETTA if you have had an allergic reaction to exenatide or any of the other ingredients in BYETTA. Severe allergic reactions can happen with BYETTA. Stop taking BYETTA and get medical help right away. Tell your healthcare provider if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if BYETTA will harm your unborn baby. Talk to your healthcare provider first if you are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. The most common side effects with BYETTA include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, feeling jittery, dizziness, headache, acid stomach, constipation, and weakness. Nausea most commonly happens when first starting BYETTA, but may become less over time. These are not all the side effects with BYETTA. Talk to your healthcare provider about any side effect that bothers you or that does not go away. How Victoza\u00ae works If you have type 2 diabetes, your doctor or diabetes care team may have told you that your body may not produce enough insulin or your body may not respond to the insulin it makes. Insulin helps the sugar in the food you eat move from your blood into your cells. GLP-1 Is a Hormone That Helps Lower Blood Sugar If your body is not making enough of a hormone called GLP-1 or not using it correctly, then you may not be getting the right amount of insulin to help sugar make the transition from the blood to the cells. Victoza\u00ae Is 97% Similar to GLP -1, a Natural Hormone Made in Your Body By acting like GLP -1, Victoza\u00ae helps make more insulin available in your blood to help lower your blood sugar levels quickly. This hormone is released from your small intestine when you eat\u2014and can slow down the process of food leaving your stomach, which helps control your blood sugar levels. Victoza\u00ae Helps Beta Cells Work the Way They Should GLP-1 triggers important cells in your pancreas, called beta cells , to make insulin when your blood sugar is too high. This is important because, over time, beta cells stop working in people with type 2 diabetes. By the time of diagnosis, about 50% of beta cells are no longer working the way they should. Victoza\u00ae Is Not Insulin Victoza\u00ae is taken once a day by injection. It does not contain insulin and should not be taken with insulin. Victoza\u00ae may be taken alone or in combination with one or more common oral type 2 diabetes medications, including biguanides (such as metformin), sulfonylureas (SUs) [rDNA origin] injection) is an injectable prescription medicine that may improve blood sugar (glucose) in adults with type 2 diabetes when used along with diet and exercise. Victoza\u00ae is not recommended as the first medication to treat diabetes. Victoza\u00ae has not been studied in patients with history of inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis). Victoza\u00ae is not a substitute for insulin and has not been studied in combination with prandial (mealtime) insulin. Victoza\u00ae is not for people with type 1 diabetes or people with diabetic ketoacidosis. It is not known if Victoza\u00ae is safe and effective in children. Victoza\u00ae is not recommended for use in children. Important Safety Information In animal studies, Victoza\u00ae caused thyroid tumors\u2014including thyroid cancer \u2014in some rats and mice. It is not known whether Victoza\u00ae causes thyroid tumors or a type of thyroid cancer called medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) in people, which may be fatal if not detected and treated early. Do not use Victoza\u00ae if you or any of your family members have a history of MTC or if you have Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2). While taking Victoza\u00ae, tell your doctor if you get a lump or swelling in your neck, hoarseness, trouble swallowing, or shortness of breath. These may be symptoms of thyroid cancer. Do not use Victoza\u00ae if you are allergic to liraglutide or any of the ingredients in Victoza\u00ae. Serious allergic reactions can happen with Victoza\u00ae. If symptoms of serious allergic reactions occur, stop taking Victoza\u00ae and seek medical attention. Pancreatitis may be severe and lead to death. Before taking Victoza\u00ae, tell your doctor if you have had pancreatitis, gallstones, a history of alcoholism, or high blood triglyceride levels since these medical conditions make you more likely to get pancreatitis. Stop taking Victoza\u00ae and call your doctor right away if you have pain in your stomach area that is severe and will not go away, occurs with or without vomiting, or is felt going from your stomach area through to your ba ck. These may be symptoms of pancreatitis. Before using Victoza\u00ae, tell your doctor about all the medicines you take, especially sulfonylurea medicines or insulin, as taking them with Victoza\u00ae may affect how each medicine works. If you use Victoza\u00ae with insulin, you may give both injections in the same body area (for example, your stomach area), but not right next to each other. Also tell your doctor if you have severe stomach problems such as slowed emptying of your stomach (gastroparesis) or problems with digesting food; have or have had kidney or liver problems; have any other medical conditions; or are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Tell your doctor if you are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is unknown if Victoza\u00ae will harm your unborn baby or if Victoza\u00ae passes into your breast milk. Your risk for getting hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, is higher if you take Victoza\u00ae with another medicine that can cause low blood sugar, such as a sulfonylurea or insulin. The dose of your sulfonylurea medi cine or insulin may need to be lowered while taking Victoza\u00ae. Victoza\u00ae may cause nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea leading to dehydration, which may cause kidney failure. This can happen in people who have never had kidney problems before. Drinking plenty of fluids may reduce your chance of dehydration. The most common side effects with Victoza\u00ae include headache, nausea, and diarrhea. Nausea is most common when first starting Victoza\u00ae, but decreases over time in most people. Immune system related reactions, including hives, were more common in people treated with Victoza\u00ae compared to people treated with other diabetes drugs in medical studies. www.medscape.com Another Positive CV Outcomes Trial for Diabetes Drug: SUSTAIN -6 Lisa Nainggolan |September 16, 2016 second glucagonlike- peptide 1 (GLP -1) agonist has shown positive results in a major cardiovascular -outcomes trial in type 2 diabetes patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease. Patients treated with one of two doses of the investigational agent semaglutide (Novo Nordisk), which has a long half -life and only needs to be injected subcutaneously once a week, had a significant 26% lower risk of the primary composite outcome of first occurrence of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), or nonfatal stroke over 2 years compared with those receiving placebo in the SUSTAIN -6 trial, reported here at the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) 2016 Annual Meeting today. Semaglutide was also a potent glucose- lowering agent, with significant and sustained reductions in HbA 1c levels seen with the agent, as compared with placebo, and similar rates of hypoglycemia, although glucose lowering was not the main point of the trial. The lower cardiovascular risk was principally driven by a significant 39% decrease in nonfatal stroke and a 26% reduction in nonfatal MI (nonsignificant); there was no difference in cardiovascular deaths between the different arms of the trial \u2014 0.5 mg of semaglutide once weekly, 1.0 mg of semaglutide once weekly, and corresponding placebo groups. And the number of patients who would need to be treated to prevent one event of the primary outcome over 2 years was 45. The main results of the 3200 -patient trial conducted in 22 countries were reported by the principal investigator, cardiologist Steven P Marso, MD, of the Research Medical Center, Kansas City, Missouri, to applause from a packed convention hall and were simultaneously published online in the New England Journal of Medi cine. Cardiologist Dr Lars Ryd\u00e9n, from Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden, who was not involved in the SUSTAIN -6 trial but was the designated discussant at the meeting, said the reduction in cardiovascular events seen with semaglutide in the trial \"is quite substantial and better than\" is seen in some studies of cardiology agents \u2014 for example, platelet- stabilizing drugs. However, he noted that the separation of curves \"takes some time, around a year and a half, but from then on [the benefit] expands.\" Given that the primary end point was driven by nonfatal stroke and to a lesser extent MI, but not by death, and that hospitalization for heart failure was not affected, the effect of semaglutide is likely on atherosclerosis, he noted. Regarding the lack of a reduction in cardiovascular deaths with semaglutide in the study, Dr Ryd\u00e9n told Medscape Medical News : \"It takes time for cardiovascular benefits to translate into mortality \u2014 it's only 2.1 years [trial duration]. They had enough events to show what they wanted, but it's still a very short period in the life of people with diabetes.\" There was a concern about higher rates of retinopathy complications in those receiving semaglutide. Vitreous hemorrhage, blindness, or conditions requiring treatment with an intravitreal agent or photocoagulation were significantly higher among those receiving semaglutide, occurring in 3% of patients on the active drug compared with 1.8% of the placebo group, a 76% increase ( P = .02). Presenting this finding as part of the clinical and metabolic outcomes of the study, endocrinologist Tina Vilsb\u00f8ll, MD, DMSc, of the Center for Diabetes Research, Gentofte Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark, said: \"This is the only forest plot that goes in the wrong direction.\" However, she pointed out, \"The signals we saw were mostly only in patients with retinopathy at baseline.\" Nevertheless, she noted that there is an association between rapid glucose lowering and retinopathy \u2014 as seen in the DCCT trial\u2014and this observation requires further investigation. Asked to comment on the findings for Medscape Medical News , endocrinologist Bernie Zinman, MDCM, FRCPC, FACP, from Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, stressed that \"the retinal outcomes [in SUSTAIN - 6] can't be ignored; it's a small number of events, but [ Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes: Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcome Results \u2014A Long Term Evaluation ] LEADER also had it going in that direction, so I think that has to be further evaluated to determine whether it's real or not.\" \"Is it just a worsening of retinopathy when you have rapid improvement and control [of glucose]? Or is there a biological effect on the eye? It remains to be seen.\" Wonderful Era for Diabetes \u2014 GLP -1 Agonist/SGLT ( Victoza), which in June demonstrated cardiovascular benefit when added to standard of care in type 2 diabetes patients at high cardiovascular risk in the LEADER trial. LEADER was the second such mandat ed FDA cardiovascular safety study for a diabetes drug to show cardiovascular benefit, rather than just lack of harm, on top of standard therapy in type 2 diabetes patients at high cardiovascular risk, after the EMPA- REG trial, and the first with an agent from the GLP -1 receptor agonist class. EMPA- REG was the first trial to show a reduction in cardiovascular death with a glucose- lowering drug, the class of contemporary diabetes agent, and this study was reported a year ago, at the EASD meeting in 2015. Importantly, these two classes of glucose -lowering agents, GLP -1 agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors, seem to be reducing cardiovascular events via different mechanisms \u2014 the GLP -1 agonists via a delay in the progression of atherosclerosis while the SGLT2 inhibitors appear to be preventing heart failure and associated deaths. Commenting on how the landscape now looks for contemporary diabetes drugs, Dr Zinman \u2014 who was an investigator for the EMPA -REG trial \u2014 told Medscape Medical News : \"We are in a wonderful era of diabetes. We have drugs that don't cause hypoglycemia or weight gain, and they work very effectively. They can be used in combination \u2014 and I think they should be \u2014 and one has to study whether together they will be even better.\" Regarding SUSTAIN -6 specifically, Dr Zinman said: \"It's exciting to have another positive trial with respect to cardiovascular outcomes. What was prominent was the very robust effect in reducing the primary outcome in a small number of patients over a short period of time. And despite everybody treating to target, the HbA 1c difference was substantial [between semaglutide and placebo], so this is a very potent drug that lowers A 1c very well.\" \"Endocrinologists and primary -care physicians are going to be happy that we now have opportunities to use agents that can reduce cardiovascular outcomes,\" he observed. But, \"as with all trials, new questions are raised,\" Dr Zinman pointed out. \"It's a little bit of a disappointment that there was no change in cardiovascular death, whereas with LEADER there was,\" and he reiterated the further work required to determine whether the retinopathy signal should be of concern or not. Dr Ryd\u00e9n told Medscape Medical News : \"GLP -1 receptor agonists are now shown in two major trials to be not only safe but efficient for glucose lowering, avoiding hypoglycemia, and reducing weight, so they are an ideal drug to use, for instance, with insulin.\" \"Meanwhile, we have to see whether the heart -failure protecting drug, empagliflozin, and [GLP -1 agonist] together will be something even better,\" he added. And he has another message for endocrinologists: \"Why should we ever use a sulfonylurea anymore? There are many observational and registry studies showing that sulfonylurea as an addition to metformin is perhaps not a very good choice.\" SUST AIN-6 Cardiovascular Outcomes In SUSTAIN -6, 3297 patients with type 2 diabetes and an HbA 1c of 7% or more aged at least 50 were randomized. Of them, 2735 had established cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, or both; the remainder were aged at least 60 with at least one cardiovascular risk factor. Mean duration of diabetes was 13.9 years and mean HbA 1c was 8.7%. Most patients (93.5%) were taking antihypertensive medication, 76.5% were receiving lipid- lowering drugs, and 76.3% were receiving antithrombotic medications. The trial is the first preapproval study to demonstrate cardiovascular safety of a potential agent for diabetes, as per the FDA requirement of 2008, and was conducted between February 2013 and December 2013. A fixed- dose escalation procedure was used, with a starting dose of 0.25 mg of semaglutide (or corresponding placebo) for 4 weeks that escalated to 0.5 mg for 4 weeks until the maintenance dose (0.5 mg or 1.0 mg) was reached. No change in the maintenance dose of either semaglutide or placebo was permitted for the duration of the trial. Dr Marso noted the cardiovascular risk reduction seen with semaglutide occurred early \"and extended and diverged over time,\" despite the fact an increase in pulse rate of 2 beats per minute was seen with the active drug compared with placebo. Similar risk reductions were observed with both doses of semaglutide, so they were combined for analysis purposes. Throughout the trial, a greater proportion of patients in the placebo group than the semaglutide group received additional cardiovascular medications, Dr Marso noted. \"The reduction in CV events observed with semaglutide in SUSTAIN -6 is notable, given the small study population and the short duration,\" he concluded. \"These findings are clinically relevant, as CVD is the leading cause of death in people with type 2 diabetes, and new treatment options that can also reduce the risk of CV events are needed.\" Primary and Secondary Cardiovascular and Microvascular Outcomes Outcome Semaglutide, n=1648 (%) Placebo, n=1649 (%) Hazard ratio P Primary composite outcome* 6.6 8.9 0.74 < .001 for noninferiority; 0.02 for superiority Death from any cause 3.8 3.6 1.05 0.79 CV death 2.7 2.8 0.98 0.92 Nonfatal MI 2.9 0.74 0.12 Nonfatal stroke 1.6 2.7 0.61 0.04 Revascularization 5.0 7.6 0.65 0.003 Hospitalization for HF 3.6 3.3 1.11 0.57 Retinopathy complications 3.0 1.8 1.76 0.02 New or worsening nephropathy 3.8 6.1 0.64 0.005 Glucose Lowering, Other Clinical Outcomes, and Safety Dr Vilsb\u00f8ll documented the \"sustained effect\" of semaglutide, with respect to HbA 1c and fasting plasma glucose. From an overall baseline of 8.7%, semaglutide significantly reduced HbA 1c by 1.4% and 1.1% the two doses) vs 0.4% for placebo. \"So 39% of patients on the 0.5- mg dose of semaglutide and 49% of those on 1.0- mg dose achieved the ADA target of HbA 1c < 7.0%,\" she noted, and a higher proportion of patients receiving placebo had to intensify their [other] antihyperglycemic treatment. Rates of hypoglycemia didn't differ between the active and placebo groups, either, she noted. Body weight \"decreased by almost 5 kg with the 1.0- mg dose of semaglutide, from a mean of 92.1 kg,\" compared with weight loss of 3.6 kg, on average, in the 0.5- mg group and 0.5 to 0.7 kg in the placebo recipients. Meanwhile, Lawrence Leiter, MD, FRCP, director of the lipid clinic at St Michael's Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, presented the safety findings from SUSTAIN -6 and noted that the total number of adverse events was comparable between all groups, and few serious adverse events were seen with semaglutide. As would be expected, the most common side effects with the active drug were gastrointestinal in nature; nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, and treatment discontinuation for these reasons was more frequent with semaglutide. Pancreatitis occurred in low and similar numbers in both active- drug and placebo groups, and the frequency and rate of malignant neoplasms was also similar between all arms. Dr Vilsb\u00f8ll discussed the retinopathy outcomes in more detail \u2014 the majority of subjects who developed diabetic retinopathy complications (> 80%) had preexisting retinopathy at baseline, she stressed. Specifically, 38 patients taking semaglutide needed retinal photocoagulation vs 20 on placebo; 16 had a vitreous hemorrhage vs seven; while 16 required treatment with intravitreal agents compared with 13 on placebo; and five of those taking semaglutide experienced the onset of diabetes -related blindness, compared with one in the placebo group. \"We have to look into this more; I don't have the exact explanation of why that is, but the numbers were overall small,\" Dr Vilsb\u00f8ll told Medscape Medical News. In contrast, there was a \"very nice effect\" of semaglutide on nephropathy, she noted. In conclusion, she said: \"It's great to see another trial with a GLP -1 agonist being positive. It is in a high- risk population, and we are not completely sure whether we'll see the same results in a broader population. \"But a risk reduction of 26% overall is really important for me as a diabetologist with this class. It might take a couple of years until we have this agent on the market, but it's good for the class, and it's good for the patient.\" Dr Marso reports personal fees from Novo Nordisk during the conduct of the study; grant support and personal fees from Novo Nordisk, and personal fees from Abbott Vascular and AstraZeneca outside the submitted work.

Article Medscape Medical News \u00a9 2016 WebMD, LLC How BYDUREON Works BYDUREON Helps Your Body Make Insulin Only When It's Needed BYDUREON (exenatide extended- release for injectable suspension) acts like a natural hormone that tells your body when to make its own insulin. Just as a thermostat senses rises in temperature, your body senses rises in blood sugar and BYDUREON works with your body to enhance its ability to release its own insulin, only at the times it's needed. Here's what happens: After you eat a meal, your blood sugar level usually goes up. When your body senses this rise in blood sugar, BYDUREON enhances your body's ability to release its own insulin. When your body senses your blood sugar has come down to the right level, the release of insulin slows. Important Safety Information: Hypoglycemi a Your risk for getting low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) is higher if you take BYDUREON with another medicine that can cause low blood sugar, such as a sulfonylurea. The dose of your sulfonylurea may need to be lowered while you use BYDUREON. Signs and symptoms of low blood sugar may include shakiness, headache, drowsiness, weakness, dizziness, confusion, irritability, hunger, fast heartbeat, sweating, and feeling jittery. Just One Dose Lasts All Week Long Each weekly dose of BYDUREON is made up of microspheres that hold the medicine. Over time the microspheres slowly dissolve, continuously releasing the medicine into your body over an entire week. WHAT IS BYDUREON\u00ae (exenatide extended -release for injectable suspension)? BYDUREON is an injectable prescription medicine that may improve blood sugar (glucose) in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and should be used along with diet and exercise. BYDUREON is not recommended as the first medication to treat diabetes. BYDUREON is a long -acting form of the medication in BYETTA\u00ae (exenatide) injection so both drugs should not be used together. BYDUREON is not a substitute for insulin and has not been studied in combination with insulin. BYDUREON is not for people with type 1 diabetes or people with diabeti c ketoacidosis (a condition caused by very high blood sugar). BYDUREON is not recommended for use in children. It is not known if BYDUREON is safe and effective in people with a history of pancreatitis or severe kidney problems. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION for BYDUREON POSSIBLE THYROID TUMORS, INCLUDING CANCER: In animal studies, BYDUREON caused rats to develop tumors of the thyroid gland. Some of these tumors were cancer. It is not known if BYDUREON causes thyroid tumors or a type of thyroid cancer called medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) in people. Do not take BYDUREON if you or any of your family members have MTC or if you have Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2. While taking BYDUREON, tell your healthcare provider if you get a lump or swelling in your neck, hoarseness, trouble swallowing, or shortness of breath. These may be symptoms of thyroid cancer. Do not take BYDUREON if you have had an allergic reaction to exenatide or any of the other ingredients in BYDUREON. Severe allergic reactions can h appen with BYDUREON. Symptoms of a severe allergic reaction to BYDUREON are severe rash or itching, swelling of your face, lips, and throat that may cause difficulty breathing or swallowing, feeling faint or dizzy and very rapid heartbeat. If you have any symptoms of a severe allergic reaction, stop taking BYDUREON and call your healthcare provider right away. Inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) may happen, which may be severe and lead to death. Before taking BYDUREON, tell your healthcare provider if you have had pancreatitis, stones in your gallbladder (gallstones), a history of alcoholism, or high blood triglyceride levels. Stop taking BYDUREON and call your healthcare provider right away if you have pain in your stomach area (abdomen) that is severe and will not go away, occurs with or without vomiting, or is felt going from your stomach area through to your back. These may be symptoms of pancreatitis. Your risk for getting low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) is higher if you take BYDUREON with another medicine that can cause low blood sugar, such as a sulfonylurea. The dose of your sulfonylurea may need to be lowered while you use BYDUREON. Signs and symptoms of low blood sugar may include shakiness, headache, drowsiness, weakness, dizziness, confusion, irritability, hunger, fast heartbeat, sweating, and feeling jittery. Tell your healthcare provider if you have or had kidney problems or a kidney transplant. BYDUREON may cause nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, leading to loss of fluids (dehydration). Dehyd ration may cause kidney failure; this can happen in people who have never had kidney problems before. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea that will not go away or if you cannot drink liquids. Tell your healthcare provider if you have severe problems with your stomach, such as delayed emptying of your stomach (gastroparesis) or problems with digesting food. The most common side effects with BYDUREON include nausea, diarrhea, headache, vomiting, constipation, itc hing at injection site, a small bump (nodule) at the injection site, and indigestion. Nausea most commonly happens when first starting BYDUREON, but may become less over time. Before using BYDUREON, tell your doctor about all the medicines you take, as taking them with BYDUREON may affect how each medicine works. Tell your healthcare provider if you take other diabetes medicines, especially insulin or a sulfonylurea, or warfarin sodium (Coumadin \u00ae or Jantoven\u00ae). Tell your healthcare provider if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if BYDUREON will harm your unborn baby.

Read the Instructions for Use that comes with TRULICITY. Use TRULICITY exactly as your healthcare provider tells you to. Your healthcare provider should show you how to use TRULICITY before you use it for the first time. TRULICITY is injected under the skin (subcutaneously) of your stomach (abdomen), thigh, or upper arm. Do not inject TRULICITY into a muscle (intramuscularly) or vein (intravenousl y). Use TRULICITY 1 time each week on the same day each week at any time of the day. You may change the day of the week as long as your last dose was given 3or more days before. If you miss a dose of TRULICITY, take the missed dose as soon as possible if there are at least 3 days (72 hours) until your next scheduled dose. If there are less than 3days remaining, skip the missed dose and take your next dose on the regularly schedul ed day. Do not take 2doses of TRULICITY within 3days of each other. You can use TRULICITY with or without food. Do not mix insulin and TRULICITY together in the same injection. You may give an injection of TRULICITY and insulin in the same body are a (such as, your stomach area), but not right next to each other. Change (rotate) injection site with each weekly injection. Do not use the same site for each injection. Do not share your pen, syringe, or needles with another person. You may give another person an infection or get an infection from them.

FDA Approves Albiglutide, a Once -Weekly GLP -1 Injectable Diabetes Drug The Food and (FDA) has approved albiglutide agonist to treat type 2 diabetes.... \"Tanzeum is a new treatment option for the millions of Americans living with type 2 diabetes,\" Curtis Rosebraugh, MD, MPH, director of the Office of Drug Evaluation II in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research is quoted in a press release. \"It can be used alone or added to existing treatment regimens to control blood sugar levels in the overall management of diabetes.\" Albiglutide is indicated as monotherapy or in combination therapy glimepiride, nsulin. Albiglutide, a GLP -1 receptor agonist, is a biological product for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, administered once- weekly using an injector pen supplied with a 5mm 29- gauge thin -walled needle. GLP -1 is an important incretin hormone that helps reduce blood glucose levels but, in people with type 2 diabetes, its production is often reduced or absent. It is not indicated for patients with type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis or as first -line therapy for patients who can't be managed with diet and exercise. The drug will also carry a boxed warning on its label stating that thyroid C - cell tumors have been observed in rodent studies with some drugs in this class but that it is unknown whether this particular drug causes these types of tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), in humans. Albiglutide should not be used in patients who have a personal or family history of MTC or have multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2 (which predisposes them to MTC). The FDA is requiring postmarketing studies, including a trial to evaluate dosing, efficacy, and safety in pediatric patients; an MTC case registry of at least 15 years; and a cardiovascular -outcomes trial in patients with high baseline risk of cardiovascular disease. The most common si de effects in clinical trials of albiglutide were diarrhea, nausea, and injection -site reactions. The FDA approved albiglutide with a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS), where the company has a communication plan to inform healthcare providers about the serious risks associated with it. Albiglutide was approved last month in the European Union under the name Eperzan. In the US, it joins other GLP -1 agonists already on the market, in the wings is Lilly's dulaglutide. The FDA approval of albiglutide is based on the results of GSK's comprehensive Phase III Harmony program, consisting of eight trials and involving over 5,000 patients, over 2,000 of whom were treated with Tanzeum. The Harmony studies evaluated albiglutide against commonly - used classes of type 2 diabetes treatment, including insulin, metformin, glimepiride and pioglitazone, in patients at different stages of the disease, as well as those with renal impairment. Following this approval by the FDA, GSK anticipates the US launch of Tanzeum in the third quarter of 2014.

Monitor renal function in patients with renal impairment reporting severe adverse ga strointestinal reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] . 2.4 Reconstitution of th e Lyophilized Powder The lyophilized powder contained within the Pen must be reconstituted prior to administration. See Patient Instructions for Use for complete ad ministration instructions with illustrations. The instructions may also be found at www.TA NZEUM.com. Instruct patients as follows: Pen Reconstitution a) Hold the Pen body with the clear cartridge poi nting up to see the [1] in the number window. b) To reconstitute the lyophilized powder with the diluent in the Pen, twist the clear cartridge on the Pen in the direction of the arrow until the Pen is felt/heard to \"click\" into place and the [2] is seen in the number window. This mixes the diluent with the lyophilized powder. c) Slowly and gently rock the Pen side-to-side 5 times to mix the reconstituted solution of TANZEUM. Advise the patient to not shake the Pen hard to avoid foaming. d) Wait 15 minutes for the 30-mg Pen and 30 minutes for the 50-mg Pen to ensure that the reconstituted solution is mixed. Preparing Pen for Injection e) Slowly and gently rock the Pen side-to-side 5 additional times to mix the reconstituted solution. f) Visually inspect the reconstituted solution in th e viewing window for particulate matter. The reconstituted solution will be yellow in colo r. After reconstitution, use TANZEUM within 8 hours. g) Holding the Pen upright, attach the needle to th e Pen. Gently tap the clear cartridge to bring large bubbles to the top. 4See Dosage and Administration (2.5) for important administration instructions, including the injection procedure. Alternate Method of Reconstitution (Healthcare Professional Use Only) The Patient Instructions for Use provide directions for the patient to wait 15 minutes for the 30- mg Pen and 30 minutes for the 50-mg Pen after the lyophilized powder and diluent are mixed to ensure reconstitution. Healthcare professionals may utilize the followi ng alternate method of reconstitution. Because this method relies on appropriate swirling and visu al inspection of the solution, it should only be performed by healthcare professionals. a) Follow Step A (Inspect Your Pen and Mix Y our Medication) in th e Instructions for Use. Make sure you have: Inspected the Pen for [1] in the number window and expiration date. Twisted the clear car tridge until [2] appears in the number window and a \"click\" is heard. This combines the medicine powder and liquid in the clear cartridge. b) Hold the Pen with the clear cartridge poi nting up and maintain this orientation throughout the reconstitution. c) Gently swirl the Pen in small circular motions for at least one minute. Avoid shaking as this can result in foaming, which may affect the dose. d) Inspect the solution, and if needed, continue to gently swirl the Pen until all the powder is dissolved and you see a clear yello w solution that is free of particles. A small amount of foam, on top of the solution at the end of reconstitution, is normal. For 30-mg Pen: Complete dissolution usually occurs within 2 minutes but may take up to 5 minutes, as confirmed by visual inspection for a clear yellow solution free of particles. For 50-mg Pen: Complete dissolution usually occurs within 7 minutes but may take up to 10 minutes. e) After reconstitution, continue to follow the steps in the Instructions for Use, starting at Step B: Attach the Needle. 2.5 Important Administ ration Instructions Instruct patients as follows: The pen should be used within 8 hours of r econstitution prior to attaching the needle. After attaching the supplied needle, remove air bubbles by slowly twisting the Pen until you see the [3] in the number window. At the same time, the injection button will be automatically released from the bottom of the Pen. Use immediately after the needle is attached and primed. The product can clog the needle if allowed to dry in the primed needle. 5 After subcutaneously inserting the needle into the skin in the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm region, press the injection button. Hold the inje ction button until you hear a \"click\" and then hold the button for 5 additional seconds to deliver the full dose. When using TANZEUM with insulin, instruct patients to administer as separate injections and to never mix the products. It is acceptable to inje ct TANZEUM and insulin in the same body region but the injections should not be adjacent to each other. When injecting in the same body region, advise pa tients to use a different injection site each week. TANZEUM must not be administered intravenously or intramuscularly. 3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS TANZEUM is supplied as follows: For injection: 30-m g lyophilized powder in reconstitution. For injection: 50-mg 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS 4.1 Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma TANZEUM is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) or in patients with Multiple E ndocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . 4.2 Hypersensitivity TANZEUM is contraindicated in patients with a prior serious hypersensitivity reaction to albiglutide or to any of the product components [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Risk of Thyroid C-cell Tumors Nonclinical studies in rodents of clinically relevant doses of GLP-1 receptor agonists showed dose-related and treatment-dura tion-dependent increases in th e incidence of thyroid C-cell tumors (adenomas and carcinomas). Carcinogeni city studies could not be conducted with TANZEUM because drug-clearing, anti-drug antibodies develop in animals used for these types of studies [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)] . It is unknown whether GLP-1 receptor agonists are associated with thyroid C-cell tumors, including MTC in humans [see Boxed Warning, Contraindications (4.1)] . Across 8 Phase III clinical trials [see Clinical Studies (14)], MTC was diagnosed in 1 patient receiving TANZEUM and 1 patient receiving pl acebo. Both patients had markedly elevated serum calcitonin levels at baseline. TANZEUM is contraindicated in pati ents with a personal or family history of MTC or in patients with MEN 2. Counsel patients regarding the ri sk for MTC with the use of TANZEUM and 6inform them of symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g., a mass in the neck, dysphagia, dyspnea, persistent hoarseness). The clinical value of routine monitoring of serum calcitonin to diagnose MTC in patients at risk for MTC has not been established. Elevated serum calcitonin is a biological mark er of MTC. Patients with MTC usually have calcitonin values >50 ng/L. Patients with thyroi d nodules noted on physical examination or neck imaging should be referred to an endocrinologist for further evaluation. Routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC in patients treated with TANZEUM. Such mon itoring may increase the risk of unnecessary procedures, due to the low specificity of serum calcitonin testing for MTC and a high background incidence of thyroid disease. If serum calcitonin is measured and found to be elevated, the patient should be referred to an endocrinologist fo r further evaluation. 5.2 Acute Pancreatitis In clinical trials, acute pancreatitis has been reported in association with TANZEUM. Across 8 Phase III clinical trials [see Clinical Studies (14)] , pancreatitis adjudicated as likely related to therapy occurr ed more frequently in patients receiving TANZEUM (6 of 2,365 [0.3%]) than in patients receiving placebo (0 of 468 [0%]) or active comparat ors (2 of 2,065 [0.1%]). After initiation of TANZEUM, observe patients ca refully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis (including persistent severe abdom inal pain, sometimes radiating to the back and which may or may not be accompanied by vomiting). If pancre atitis is suspected, promptly discontinue TANZEUM. If pancreatitis is confir med, TANZEUM should not be restarted. TANZEUM has not been studied in patients with a history of pa ncreatitis to determine whether these patients are at increased risk for pancreat itis. Consider other antidiabetic therapies in patients with a history of pancreatitis. 5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use of Insulin Secretagogues or Insulin The risk of hypoglycemia is increased when TA NZEUM is used in combination with insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylureas) or insulin. Therefore, patients may require a lower dose of sulfonylurea or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia in this setting [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Across 8 Phase III clinical trials [see Clinical Studies (14)] , a serious hypersensitivity reaction with pruritus, rash, and dyspnea occurred in a patient treated with TANZEUM. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue use of TANZEUM; treat promptly per standard of care and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve [see Contraindications (4.2)] . 5.5 Renal Impairment In patients treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists, there have been postmarketing reports of acute renal failure and worsening of chronic renal fa ilure, which may sometimes require hemodialysis. Some of these events were reported in pa tients without known underl ying renal disease. A majority of reported events occurred in patien ts who had experienced nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or dehydration. In a trial of TANZEUM in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Studies 7(14.3)], the frequency of such gastrointestinal reactions increased as renal function declined [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] . Because these reactions may worsen renal function, use caution when initiating or escalating doses of TANZEUM in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Us e in Specific Populations (8.6)]. 5.6 Macrovascular Outcomes There have been no clinical trials establishi ng conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with TANZEUM or a ny other antidiabetic drug. 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious reactions are describ ed below or elsewhere in the labeling: Risk of Thyroid C-cell Tumors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Acute Pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use of Insulin Secretagogues or Insulin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Renal Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compar ed with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Pool of Placebo-Controlled Trials The data in Table 1 are derived from 4 placeb o-controlled trials. TANZEUM was used as monotherapy in 1 trial and as add-on therapy in 3 trials [see Clinical Studies (14)] . These data reflect exposure of 923 patients to TANZEUM and a mean duration of exposure to TANZEUM of 93 weeks. The mean age of participants was 55 years, 1% of particip ants were 75 years or older and 53% of participants were male. The population in these studi es was 48% white, 13% African/African American, 7% Asian, and 29% Hispanic/Latino. At baseline, the population had diabetes for an average of 7 years and had a mean HbA1c of 8.1%. At baseline, 17% of the population in these studies reported peripheral neuropathy and 4% repor ted retinopathy. Baseline estimated renal function was normal or m ildly impaired (eGFR >60 mL/min/1.73 m2) in 91% of the study population and moderately im paired (eGFR 30 to 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) in 9%. Table 1 shows common adverse r eactions excluding hypoglycemia a ssociated with the use of TANZEUM in the pool of placebo-c ontrolled trials. These adverse reactions were not present at baseline, occurred more commonly on TANZEUM th an on placebo, and occurred in at least 5% of patients treated with TANZEUM. 8Table 1. Adverse Reactions in Placebo-controlled Trials Reported in 5% of Patients Treated with TANZEUMa Adverse Reaction Placebo (N = 468) % TANZEUM (N = 923) % Upper respiratory tr act infection 13.0 14.2 Diarrhea 10.5 13.1 Nausea 9.6 11.1 Injection site reactionb 2.1 10.5 Cough 6.2 6.9 Back pain 5.8 6.7 Arthralgia 6.4 6.6 Sinusitis 5.8 6.2 Influenza 3.2 5.2 a Adverse reactions reported includes adverse r eactions occurring with the use of glycemic rescue medications which included metformi n (17% for placebo and 10% for TANZEUM) and insulin (24% for placebo and 14% for TANZEUM). b See below for other events of in jection site reactions reported. Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions In the pool of placebo-controlled trials, gastrointestinal complaints occurred more frequently among patients receiving TANZEUM (39%) than pa tients receiving placebo (33%). In addition to diarrhea and nausea (see Table 1), the following gastrointestinal adverse reactions also occurred more frequently in patients receiv ing TANZEUM: vomiting (2.6% versus 4.2% for placebo versus TANZEUM), gastroesophageal reflux disease (1.9% versus 3.5% for placebo versus TANZEUM), and dyspepsia (2.8% ve rsus 3.4% for placebo versus TANZEUM). Constipation also contributed to the frequently reported reactions. In the group treated with TANZEUM, investigators graded the severity of GI reactions as \"mild\" in 56% of cases, \"moderate\" in 37% of cases, and \"severe\" in 7% of cases. Discontinuation due to GI adverse reactions occurred in 2% of individuals on TANZEUM or placebo. Injection Site Reactions In the pool of placebo-controlled trials, injection site reactions occurred more frequently on TANZEUM (18%) than on placebo (8%). In additi on to the term injection site reaction (see Table 1), the following other types of injection site reactions also occurred more frequently on TANZEUM: injection site hematoma (1.9% versus 2.1% for ), erythema (0.4% versus, 1.7% for placebo versus TANZEUM), injection site rash (0% versus 1.4% for placebo , injection ensitivity (0% versus TANZEUM), and hemorrhage (0.6% versus 0.7% for placebo versus TANZEUM). Injecti on site pruritus also contributed to the frequently reported reactions. The majority of inject ion site reactions were judged as \"mild\" by investigators in both groups (73% for TANZEUM versus 94% for placebo). More patients on TANZEUM than on placebo: discontinued due to an injection site re action (2% versus 0.2%), experienced more than 2 reactions (38% versus 20%), had a reaction judged by inves tigators to be \"moderate\" or 9\"severe\" (27% versus 6%) and required local or systemic treatment for the reactions (36% versus 11%). Pool of Placebo- and Active-controlled Trials The occurrence of adverse reactions was also evaluated in a larger pool of patients with type 2 diabetes participating in 7 placebo- and active-controlled trials. Th ese trials evaluated the use of TANZEUM as monotherapy, and as add-on therapy to oral antidiabetic agents, and as add-on therapy to basal insulin [see Clinical Studies (14)] . In this pool, a tota l of 2,116 patients with type 2 diabetes were tr eated with TANZEUM for a mean duration of 75 weeks. The mean age of patients treated with TANZEUM was 55 years, 1.5% of the population in these studies was 75 years or older and 51% of participants were male. Forty-eight percent of patients were white, 15% African/African American, 9% Asian, and 26% were Hispanic/Latino. At baseline, the population had diabetes for an average of 8 year s and had a mean HbA1c of 8.2%. At baseline, 21% of the population reported peripheral neur opathy and 5% reported retinopathy. Baseline estimated renal function was normal or m ildly impaired (eGFR >60 mL/min/1.73 m 2) in 92% of the population and moderately impaired (eGFR 30 to 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) in 8% of the population. In the pool of placebo- and activ e-controlled trials, the types and frequency of common adverse reactions excluding hypoglycemia were similar to those listed in Table 1. Other Adverse Reactions Hypoglycemia The proportion of patients experiencing at le ast one documented symptomatic hypoglycemic episode on TANZEUM and the proportion of pa tients experiencing at least one severe hypoglycemic episode on TANZEUM in clinical trials [see Clinical Studies (14)] is shown in Table 2. Hypoglycemia was more frequent when TANZEUM was added to sulfonylurea or insulin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] . 10Table 2.

More cases of pneumonia in the group receiving TANZEUM were serious (0.4% for TANZEUM vers us 0.1% for all comparators). Atrial r the pool of 7 placebo- and active-controlled tr ials, adverse reactions of atrial fibrillation (1.0%) and atrial flutter (0.2 %) were reported more frequently for TANZEUM than for all comparators (0.5% and 0%, respectively). In bo th groups, patients with events were generally male, older, and had underlying renal impairment or cardiac disease (e.g., hi story of arrhythmia, palpitations, congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy, etc.). Appendicitis In the pool of placebo- and active- controlled trials, serious even ts of appendicitis occurred in 0.3% of patients treated w ith TANZEUM compared with 0% among all comparators. Immunogenicity In the pool of 7 placebo- and active-controlled trials, 116 (5.5%) of 2,098 patients exposed to TANZEUM tested positive for anti -albiglutide antibodies at any time during the trials. None of these antibodies were shown to neutralize the activity of albiglutide in an in vitro bioassay. Presence of antibody did not correlate with redu ced efficacy as measured by HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose or specific adverse reactions. Consistent with the high homo logy of albiglutide with human GLP-1, the majority of patients (approximately 79%) with anti-albiglutide antibo dies also tested positive for anti-GLP-1 antibodies; none were neutraliz ing. A minority of patients (a pproximately 17%) who tested positive for anti-albiglutide antibodies also tran siently tested positive for antibodies to human albumin. The detection of antibody formati on is highly dependent on the sens itivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including a ssay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample coll ection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, the incidence of antibodies to albiglutide cannot be directly compared with the incidence of antibodie s of other products. Liver Enzyme Abnormalities In the pool of placebo- and activ e-controlled trials, a similar proportion of patients experienced at least one event of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increase of 3-fold or greater above the upper limit of normal (0.9% and 0.9% for all comp arators versus TANZEUM). Three subjects on TANZEUM and one subject in the all-comparator group experienced at le ast one event of ALT increase of 10-fold or greater above the upper limit of normal . In one of the 3 cases an alternate etiology was identified to explain the rise in liver enzyme (acute viral hepatitis). In one case, insufficient information was obtained to establish or refute a drug-related causality. In the third 12case, elevation in ALT (10 times the upper limit of normal) was accompanied by an increase in total bilirubin (4 times the upper limit of normal) and occurred 8 days after the first dose of TANZEUM. The etiology of hepatocellular injury was possibly related to TANZEUM but direct attribution to TANZEUM was confounded by the presence of gallstone disease diagnosed on ultrasound 3 weeks after the event . Gamma Glutamyltransferase (GGT) Increase In the pool of placebo-controlled trials, the adverse event of increased GGT occurred more frequently in the group treated with TANZ EUM (0.9% and 1.5% for placebo versus TANZEUM). Heart Rate Increase In the pool of placebo-controlled trials, mean h eart rate in patients treated with TANZEUM was higher by an average of 1 to 2 bpm compared with mean heart rate in patients treated with placebo across study visits. The long-te rm clinical effects of the incr ease in heart rate have not been established [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] . 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS TANZEUM did not affect the absorp tion of orally administered me dications tested in clinical pharmacology studies to any c linically relevant degree [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . However, TANZEUM causes a delay of gastric emptying, and thereby has the potential to impact the absorption of concomitantly admini stered oral medications. Caution should be exercised when oral medications are concomitantly administered with TANZEUM. 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of TANZEUM in pregnant women. Nonclinical studies have shown re productive toxicity, but not teratoge nicity, in mice treated with albiglutide at up to 39 times human exposure resulting from the maximum recommended dose of 50 mg/week, based on AUC [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1, 13.3)]. TANZEUM should not be used during pregnancy unless the expect ed benefit outweighs the potential risks. Due to the long washout period for TANZEUM, consider stopping TANZEUM at least 1 month before a planned pregnancy. There are no data on the effects of TANZEUM on human fertility. Studies in mice showed no effects on fertility [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)] . The potential risk to human fertility is unknown. 8.3 Nursing Mothers There are no adequate data to support the use of TANZEU M during lactation in humans. It is not known if TANZEUM is excreted into human milk during lactation. Given that TANZEUM is an albumin-based protein therapeutic , it is likely to be present in human milk. 13Decreased body weight in offspring was obs erved in mice treated with TANZEUM during gestation and lactation [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.3)] . A decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue TANZEU M, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother and the potential risks to the infant. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of TANZEUM have not been established in pediatric patients (younger than 18 years). 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients (N = 2,365) in 8 Phase III clinical trials who received TANZEUM, 19% (N = 444) were 65 years and older, and <3% (N = 52) were 75 years and older. No overall differences in safety or eff ectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of so me older individuals cannot be ruled out. 8.6 Renal Impairment Of the total number of patients (N = 2,365) in 8 Phase III clinical trials who received TANZEUM, 54% (N = 1,267) had mild rena l impairment (eGFR 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m2), 12% (N = 275) had moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m2) and 1% (N = 19) had severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to <30 mL/min/1.73 m2). No dosage adjustment is required in patie nts with mild (eGFR 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m2), moderate (eGFR 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m2), or severe (eGFR 15 to <30 mL/min/1.73 m2) renal impairment. Efficacy of TANZEUM in patients with type 2 diabetes and renal impairment is described elsewhere [see Clinical Studies (14.3)] . There is limited clinical e xperience in patients with severe renal impairment (19 subj ects). The frequency of GI even ts increased as renal function declined. For patients with mild, moderate, or severe impairment, the respective event rates were: diarrhea (6%, caution recommended when initiating or escalati ng doses of TANZEUM in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warn ings and Precautions (5.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 10 OVERDOSAGE No data are available with regard to overdos age in humans. Anticipat ed symptoms of an overdose may be severe nausea and vomiting. In the event of an overdose, a ppropriate supportive treatment should be initiated as dictated by the patient's clinical signs and symptoms. A pr olonged period of observation and treatment for these symptoms may be necessary, taking into ac count the half-life of TANZEUM (5 days). 11 DESCRIPTION TANZEUM is a GLP-1 receptor agon ist, a reco mbinant fusion protein comprised of 2 tandem copies of modified human GLP-1 genetically fused in tandem to human albumin. The human GLP-1 fragment sequence 7 - 36 has been modified with a glycine substit uted for the naturally- 14occurring alanine at position 8 in order to confer resistance to dipepti dylpeptidase IV (DPP-IV) mediated proteolysis. The human albumin moiety of the recombinant fusion protein, together with the DPP-IV resistance, extends the hal f-life allowing once-weekly dosing. TANZEUM has a molecular weight of 72,970 Daltons. TANZEUM is produced by a strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae modified to express the therapeutic protein. TANZEUM 30-mg Pen for injection (for subcut aneous use) contains 40.3 mg lyophilized albiglutide and 0.65 mL Water for Injection diluent designed to deliver a dose of 30 mg in a volume of 0.5 mL after reconstitution. TANZEUM 50-mg Pen for injection (for subc utaneous use) contains 67 mg lyophilized albiglutide and 0.65 mL Water for Injection diluent designed to deliver a dose of 50 mg in a volume of 0.5 mL after reconstitution. The lyophilized powder of both dose strengths is white to yellow in color and th e solvent is a clear and colorless solution. The reconstituted solution is yellow in color. Inactive ingredients include 153 mM mannitol, 0.01% (w/w) polysorbate 80, 10 mM sodium phosphate, and 117 mM trehalose dihydrate. TA NZEUM does not cont ain a preservative. 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action TANZEUM is an agonist of gluc slows gastric emptying. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics TANZEUM lowers fasting glucose and reduces post prandial glucose excurs ions in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The majority of the observed reduction in fasting plasma glucose occurs after a single dose, consistent with the pharmacokine tic profile of albiglutid e. In a Phase II trial in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who received TANZEUM 30 mg, a reduction (22%) in postprandial glucose AUC (0-3 h) was observed at steady state (Week 16) compared with placebo following a mixed meal. A single dose of TANZEUM 50 mg subcutaneous (SC) did not impair glucagon response to low glucose concentrations. Gastric Motility TANZEUM slowed gastric emptying compared w ith placebo for both solids and liquids when albiglutide 100 mg (2 times th e maximum approved dosage) was ad ministered as a single dose in healthy subjects. Cardiac Electrophysiology At doses up to the maximum recommended dose (50 mg), TANZEUM does not prolong QTc to any clinically relevant extent. 1512.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following SC administration of a single 30-mg dos e to subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, maximum concentrations of albiglutide were reac hed at 3 to 5 days post-dosing. The mean peak concentration (C max) and mean area under the time-concen tration curve (AUC) of albiglutide were 1.74 mcg/mL and 465 mcg.h/mL, respectively, following a singl e dose of 30 mg albiglutide in type 2 diabetes mellitus subjects. Steady-st ate exposures are achieved following 4 to 5 weeks of once-weekly administration. Exposures at the 30-mg and 50-mg dose levels were consistent with a dose-proportional increase. Similar exposure is achieved with SC administration of albiglutide in the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm. The absolute bioavailab ility of albiglutide following SC administration has not been evaluated. Distribution The mean estimate of apparent volume of distri bution of albiglutide following SC administration is 11 L. As albiglutide is an albumin fusion molecule, plasma protei n binding has not been assessed. Metabolism Albiglutide is a protein for which the expected metabolic pathway is degradation to small peptides and individual amino acids by ubi quitous proteolytic enzymes. Classical biotransformation studies have not been perfor med. Because albiglutide is an albumin fusion protein, it likely follows a metabolic pathway si milar to native human serum albumin which is catabolized primarily in the vascular endothelium. Elimination The mean apparent clearance of albiglutide is 67 mL/h with an elimination half-life of approximately 5 days, making albiglutide suitable for once-weekly administration. Specific Patient Populations Age, Gender, Race, and Body Weight: Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis with data collected from 1,113 subjects, age, gender, race, and body weight had no clinically relevant effect on the pharm acokinetics of albiglutide. Pediatric: No pharmacokinetic data are available in pediatric patients. Renal: In a population pharmacokinetic analysis including a Phase III trial in patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, exposures were increased by appr oximately 30% to 40% in severe renal impairment compared with those observed in type 2 diabe tic patients with normal renal function. Hepatic: No clinical trials were conducted to exam ine the effects of mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of albiglutide. Therapeutic proteins such as albiglutide are catabolized by wide ly distributed proteolytic enzyme s, which are not restricted to hepatic tissue; therefore, cha nges in hepatic function are unlik ely to have any effect on the elimination of albiglutide. 16Drug Interactions In multiple-dose, drug-drug interaction trials no significant change in systemic exposures of the co-administered drugs were observed, except simv astatin (see Table 3). When albiglutide was co-administered with simvastatin, C max of simvastatin and its active metabolite simvastatin acid was increased by approximately 18% and 98%, respectively. In the same trial, AUC of simvastatin decreased by 40% and AUC of si mvastatin acid increased by 36%. Clinical relevance of these changes has not been established (see Table 3). Additionally, no clinically relevant pharmac odynamic effects on luteinizing hormone, follicle- stimulating hormone, or progesterone were obser ved when albiglutide and a combination oral contraceptive were co-adminis tered. Albiglutide did not signi ficantly alter the pharmacodynamic effects of warfarin as measured by th e international normalized ratio (INR). Table 3.

Thyroid C-cell tumors were observed in 2-year rodent car cinogenicity studies with some GLP-1 receptor agonists. The clin ical relevance of r odent thyroid findings observed with GLP-1 receptor agonists is unknown. In a mouse fertility study, males were treated with SC doses of 5, 15, or 50 mg/kg/day for 7 days prior to cohabitation with fema les, and continuing through mating. In a separate fertility study, females were treated with SC doses of 1, 5, or 50 mg/kg/day for 7 days prior to cohabitation with males, and continuing through mating. Reductions in estrous cycles were observed at 50 mg/kg/day, a dose associated with maternal toxicity (body weight loss and reduced food consumption). There were no e ffects on mating or fertility in either sex at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day (up to 39 times c linical exposure based on AUC). 13.3 Reproductive and Developmental Toxicity In order to minimize the impact of the drug- clearing, anti-drug antibody response, reproductive and developmental toxicity assessments in the mouse were partitioned to limit the dosing period to no more than approximately 15 days in each study. In pregnant mice given SC doses of 1, 5, or 50 mg/kg/day from gestation Day 1 to 6, there were no adverse effects on early embryonic developm ent through implantation at 50 mg/kg/day (39 times clinical exposure based on AUC). In pregnant mice given SC doses of 1, 5, or 50 mg/kg/day from gestation Day 6 through 15 (organogenesis), embryo-fetal lethality (post-implantation loss) and bent (wavy) ribs were observed at 50 mg/kg/day (39 times clinical exposure based on AUC), a dose associated with maternal toxicity (body weight lo ss and reduced food consumption). Pregnant mice were given SC doses of 1, 5, or 50 mg/kg/day from gestation Day 6 to 17. Offspring of pregnant mice given 50 mg/kg/day (39 times clin ical exposure based on AUC), a dose associated with maternal toxicity, had reduced body weight pre-weaning, dehydration and coldness, and a delay in balanopreputial separation. Pregnant mice were given SC doses of 1, 5, or 50 mg/kg/day from gestation Day 15 to lactation Day 10. Increased mortality and morb idity were seen at all doses ( 1 mg/kg/day) in lactating females in mouse pre- and postnat al development studies. Mortali ties have not been observed in previous toxicology studies in non -lactating or non-pregnant mice, nor in pregnant mice. These findings are consistent with lactational ileus s yndrome which has been previously reported in mice. Since the relative stress of lactation en ergy demands is lower in humans than mice and humans have large energy reserves, the mortalitie s observed in lactating mice are of questionable relevance to humans. The offspring had decr eased pre-weaning body weight which reversed post-weaning in males but not females at 5 mg/kg/day (2.2 times clinical exposure based on AUC) with no other effects on development. Low levels of albiglutide were detected in plasma of offspring. Lactating mice were given SC doses of 1, 5, or 50 mg/kg/day from lactation Day 7 to 21 (weaning) under conditions that lim it the impact of lactat ional ileus (increased caloric intake and 18culling of litters). Doses 1 mg/kg/day (exposures below clinical AUC) caused reduced weight gain in the pups during the treatment period. 14 CLINICAL STUDIES TANZEUM has been studied as monotherapy and in combination with metformin, metformin and a sulfonylurea, a thiazolidined ione (with and without metformin), and insulin glargine (with or without oral anti-diabetic drugs). The efficacy of TANZEUM was compared with placebo, glimepiride, pioglitazone, liraglutide, sitaglip tin, insulin lispro, a nd insulin glargine. Trials evaluated the use of TANZEUM 30 mg and 50 mg. Five of the 8 trials allowed optional uptitration of TANZEUM from 30 mg to 50 mg if glycemic response with 30 mg was inadequate. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, TAN ZEUM produced clinically relevant reduction from baseline in HbA1c compared with placebo. No overall differences in glycemic effectiveness or body weight were observed across demographic s ubgroups (age, gender, race/ethnicity, duration of diabetes). 14.1 Monotherapy The efficacy of TANZEUM as monotherapy was evaluated in a 52-week, randomized, double- blind, placebo-controlled, multicente r trial. In this tr ial, 296 patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on diet and exercise were randomized (1:1:1) to TANZEUM 30 mg SC once weekly, TANZEUM 30 mg SC once weekly uptitrated to 50 mg once weekly at Week 12, or placebo. The mean age of participants was 53 years, 55% of patients were men, the mean duration of diabetes was 4 years, and th e mean baseline eGFR was 84 mL/min/1.73 m2. Primary and secondary efficacy results are presented in Table 4. Figure 1 shows the mean adjusted changes in HbA1c from base line across study visits. Compared with placebo, treatment with TANZEU M 30 mg or 50 mg resulted in statistically significant reductions in HbA1c from baseline at Week 52 (see Table 4). The adjusted mean change in weight from baseline did not differ significantly between TANZEUM (-0.4 to -0.9 kg) and placebo (-0.7 kg) at Week 52. 19Table 4.

Figure 1. Mean HbA1c Change from Baselin e (ITT Population-LOCF) in a Trial of TANZEUM as Monotherapy 14.2 Combination Therapy Add-on to Metformin The efficacy of TANZEUM was evaluated in a 104-week randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial in 999 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled on background metformin therapy ( 1,500 mg daily). In this trial, TANZ EUM 30 mg SC weekly (with optional 20uptitration to 50 mg weekly after a minimum of 4 weeks) was compared with placebo, sitagliptin 100 mg daily, or glimepiride 2 mg daily (with optional ti tration to 4 mg daily). The mean age of participants was 55 years, 48% of patients were men, the mean duration of type 2 diabetes was 6 years, and the mean base line eGFR was 86 mL/min/1.73 m2. Results of the primary and secondary analyses are presente d in Table 5. Figure 2 shows the mean adjusted changes in HbA1c across study visits. Reduction in HbA1c from baseline achieved w ith TANZEUM was significantly greater than HbA1c reduction achieved with placebo, sitagliptin, and glimepiride at Week 104 (see Table 5). The difference in body weight change from ba seline between TANZEUM and glimepiride was significant at Week 104. Table 5.

Mean HbA1c Over Time (ITT Po pulation-LOCF) in a Trial Comparing TANZEUM with Placebo as Add-on Therapy in Patients Inadequately Controlled on Metformin Add-on to Pioglitazone The efficacy of TANZEUM was evaluated in a 52-week randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial in 299 patients with type 2 diabetes me llitus inadequately controlled on pioglitazone 30 mg daily (with or without metformin 1,500 mg daily). Patients were randomized to receive TANZEUM 30 mg SC weekly or placebo. The mean age of partic ipants was 55 years, 60% of patients were men, the mean duration of type 2 diabetes was 8 years, and the mean baseline eGFR was 83 mL/min/1.73 m2. Results of the primary and secondary analyses are presented in Table 6. Compared with placebo, treatment with TANZ EUM resulted in a statistically significant reduction in HbA1c from baseline at Week 52 (see Table 6). The adjusted mean change from baseline in weight did not differ signif icantly between TANZEUM (+0.3 kg) and placebo (+0.5 kg) at Week 52. 22Table 6.

Add-on to Metformin Plus Sulfonylurea The efficacy of TANZEUM was evaluated in a 52-week randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial in 657 patients with type 2 diabetes me llitus inadequately controlled on metformin (1,500 mg daily) and glimepiride (4 mg daily). Patients were randomized to receive TANZEUM 30 mg SC weekly (wit h optional uptitration to 50 mg weekly after a minimum of 4 weeks), placebo, or pioglitazone 30 mg daily (w ith optional titration to 45 mg/day). The mean age of participants was 55 years, 53% of patient s were men, the mean duration of type 2 diabetes was 9 years, and the mean baseline eGFR was 84 mL/min/1.73 m2. Results of the primary and main secondary analyses are presented in Table 7. Treatment with TANZEUM resulted in statis tically significant reduc tions in HbA1c from baseline compared with placebo (see Table 7). Treatment with TANZEUM did not meet the pre- specified, non-inferiority margin (0.3%) against pioglitazone. In this trial, TANZEUM provided less HbA1c reduction than pioglitazone and the tr eatment difference was statistically significant (see Table 7). The change from baseline in body weight for TANZEUM did not differ significantly from placebo but was significantly di fferent compared with pioglitazone (see Table 7). 23Table 7.

Combination Therapy: Active-contro lled Trial versus Basal Insulin The efficacy of TANZEUM was evaluated in a 52 -week, randomized (2:1), open-label, insulin glargine-controlled, non-inferiority trial in 735 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately contro lled on metformin 1,500 mg daily (with or without sulfonylurea). Patients were randomized to receive TANZEUM 30 mg SC weekly (with optional uptitration to 50 mg weekly) or insulin glargine (started at 10 units and titrated weekly per pr escribing information). The primary endpoint was change in HbA1c from baseline compared with insulin glargine. The starting total daily dose of insulin glargine ranged between 2 a nd 40 units (median daily dose of 10 units) and ranged between 3 and 230 units (m edian daily dose of 30 units) at Week 52. Seventy-seven percent of patients treated with TANZEUM were uptitrated to 50 mg SC weekly. The mean age of participants was 56 years, 56% of patients were men, the mean duration of type 252 diabetes was 9 years, and the mean baseline eGFR was 85 mL/min/1.73 m2.

The Medication Guide is cont ained in a separa te leaflet that accompanies the product. Inform patients about self-management practices , including the importance of proper storage of TANZEUM, injection technique, timing of dosage of TANZEUM and concomitant oral drugs, and recognition and ma nagement of hypoglycemia. Inform patients that thyroid C-cell tumors have been observed in rodents treated with some GLP-1 receptor agonists, and the human rele vance of this finding is unknown. Counsel patients to report symptoms of thyroid tumors to their physician [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Advise patients that persistent, severe abdominal pain that may radiate to the back and which may (or may not) be accompanied by vom iting is the hallmark symptom of acute pancreatitis. Instruct patien ts to discontinue TANZEUM pr omptly and to contact their physician if persistent, severe abdominal pain occurs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. The risk of hypoglycemia is increased when TANZEUM is used in combination with an agent that induces hypoglycemia, such as sulfonylurea or insuli n. Instructions for hypoglycemia should be reviewed with patients and reinforced when initiating therapy with TANZEUM, particularly when concomitantly ad ministered with a sulf onylurea or insulin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Advise patients on the symptoms of hypersensi tivity reactions and instruct them to stop taking TANZEUM and seek medical advice promptly if such symptoms occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Instruct patients to read the Instructions for Use before star ting therapy. Instruct patients on proper use, storage, a nd disposal of the pen [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.2), Patient Instructions for Use] . Instruct patients to read th e Medication Guide before starti ng TANZEUM and to read again each time the prescription is renewed. Instruct pa tients to inform their doctor or pharmacist if they develop any unusual symptom, or if any known symptom persists or worsens. Inform patients not to take an extra dose of TANZEUM to make up for a missed dose. If a dose is missed, instruct patients to take a dose as soon as possible within 3 days after the missed dose. Instruct patients to then take their next dose at their usual weekly time. If it has been longer than 3 days after the missed dose, instruct patients to wait and take TANZEUM at the next usual weekly time. 31TANZEUM is a trademark of the GSK group of companies.

There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or your treatment. What is the most important information I should know about TANZEUM? Serious side effects may happen in people who take TANZEUM, including: Possible thyroid tumors, including cancer. Tell your healthcare provider if you get a lump or swelling in your neck, hoarseness, trouble swallowing, or shortness of breath. These may be symptoms of thyroid cancer. In st udies with rats and mi ce, medicines that work like TANZEUM caused thyroid tumors, including thyroid cancer. It is not known if TANZEUM will cause thyroid tumors or a type of thyroid cancer called medullary thyroid carcinoma in people. Do not use TANZEUM if you or your family have ever had a type of thyroid cancer called medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) or if you have an endocrine system cancer called Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2). What is TANZEUM? TANZEUM is an injectable prescripti on medicine that may improve blood sugar (glucose) in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and should be used along with diet and exercise.

SYMLIN can slow down how other medicines pass through your stomach and may affect how much of them get into your body. Therefore, you may have to change the times you take certain medicines. How should I use SYMLIN? You must use SYMLIN exactly as prescribed. The amount of SYMLIN you use will depend on whether you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes. You and your doctor will decide if you can use SYMLIN. Never mix SYMLIN and insulin. You must use different syringes for SYMLIN and insulin because insulin can affect SYMLIN when the two are mixed together. Injecting SYMLIN is similar to injecting insulin. Inject SYMLIN under the skin (subcutaneously) of your stomach area (abdomen) or upper leg (thigh). Inject SYMLIN at a site that is more than 2 inches away from your insulin injection. Allow SYMLIN to warm to room temperature before injecting. Use a U-100 insulin syringe (best to use 0.3 mL [0.3 cc] size) to draw-up and inject SYMLIN. Always use a new syringe and needle for each SYMLIN injection. The dose of SYMLIN that your doctor prescribes should be one in Table 1. Use this table to match your SYMLIN dose to insulin syringe units. Table 1: SYMLIN Dosing Chart Find Your Dose in micrograms (mcg) Draw Up This Amount in U-100 Insulin Syringe (units) 15 2\u00bd 30 5 45 7\u00bd 60 10 120 20 813005-EE NDA 21-332 Page 3 Do not use SYMLIN if the liquid in the vial looks cloudy. If you take more than your prescribed dose of SYMLIN, you may get nauseous or vomit, and you may not be able to eat the amount of food you usually eat. Pay careful attention to the amount of insulin you use at this time as you may be at more risk for low blood sugar. Contact your doctor for guidance. If you miss or forget a dose of SYMLIN, wait until the next meal and take your usual dose of SYMLIN at that meal. Do not take more than your usual dose of SYMLIN . Using SYMLIN and insulin with Type 2 Diabetes (see Table 1) 1. Start SYMLIN at 60 mcg injected under your skin, just before major meals. A major meal must have at least 250 calories or 30 grams of carbohydrate. 2. Reduce your rapid-acting or short-acting insulin doses before meals by 50 percent, including fixed-mix insulins such as 70/30. This means half of the dose you usually use. 3. You must check your blood sugar before and after every meal and at bedtime. 4. Increase your dose of SYMLIN to 120 mcg on your doctor's instructions if you have not had any nausea for 3 days or more. 5. Tell your doctor right away if you have nausea with the 120 mcg dose. Your doctor will tell you how to adjust your dose of SYMLIN. 6. Your doctor may make changes to your insulin doses to better control your blood sugar once you are using the 120 mcg dose of SYMLIN. All insulin changes should be directed by your doctor. Using SYMLIN and insulin with Type 1 Diabetes (see Table 1) 1. Start SYMLIN at 15 mcg injected under your skin, just before major meals. A major meal must have at least 250 calories or 30 grams of carbohydrate. 2. When starting SYMLIN, reduce your rapid-acting or short-acting insulin doses before meals by 50 percent, including fixed-mix insulins such as 70/30. This means half of the dose you usually use. All insulin changes should be directed by your doctor. 3. You must check your blood sugar before and after every meal and at bedtime. 4. Increase your dose of SYMLIN to 30 mcg on your doctor's instructions if you have not had any nausea for 3 days or more. If you have nausea with SYMLIN at 30 mcg, call your doctor right away. Your doctor may decide that you should stop SYMLIN. 5. Increase your dose of SYMLIN to 45 mcg on your doctor's instructions if you have not had any nausea for 3 days or more while using the 30 mcg dose. 6. Increase your dose of SYMLIN to 60 mcg on your doctor's instructions if you have not had any nausea for 3 days or more while using the 45 mcg dose. 7. Call your doctor right away if you are bothered with nausea on the 45 mcg or 60 mcg dose. Your doctor may decide that you should reduce SYMLIN to the 30 mcg dose. 813005-EE NDA 21-332 Page 4 8. Your doctor may make changes to your insulin doses to better control your blood sugar once you are on a dose of SYMLIN that is right for you. All insulin changes should be directed by your doctor. Staying on SYMLIN Once you reach your recommended dose of SYMLIN, talk to your doctor about changing your insulin doses to better control your blood sugar. You may have to increase your long-acting insulin to prevent high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) between meals. Insulin changes should be directed by your doctor based on blood sugar testing. Call your doctor if nausea or low blood sugar continues while on your recommended dose of SYMLIN. Low blood sugar that happens often is a warning sign of possible severe low blood sugar, especially if you have type 1 diabetes. If you stop taking SYMLIN for any reason, su ch as surgery or illness, call your doctor. SYMLIN should be restarted as described in \"How should I use SYMLIN?\" When should I not use SYMLIN? Do not use SYMLIN if: your blood sugar is too low. you do not plan to eat. Do not inject SYMLIN if you skip a meal. you plan to eat a meal with less than 250 calories or 30 grams of carbohydrate. you are sick and can't eat your usual meal. you are having surgery or a medical test where you cannot eat. you are pregnant or breastfeeding and have not talked to your doctor. Talk to your doctor if you have any of these conditions. What should I avoid while taking SYMLIN? Do not drive or operate dangerous machinery until you know how SYMLIN affects your blood sugar. Low blood sugar makes it hard to think clearly, drive a car, use heavy machinery or do other risky activities where you could hurt yourself or others. Discuss with your doctor what activities you should avoid. Alcohol may increase the risk of low blood sugar. Your doctor will tell you which medicines you can take while using SYMLIN. Do not take other medicines that slow stomach emptying. Always have fast-acting sugar (such as hard ca ndy, glucose tablets, juice) or glucagon available to treat low blood sugar. 813005-EE NDA 21-332 Page 5 What are the possible side effects of SYMLIN? Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) SYMLIN is used with insulin to lower your blood sugar, but your blood sugar may drop too low, especially if you have type 1 diabetes. See \"What is the most important information I should know about SYMLIN?\" When starting SYMLIN, reduce your doses of insulin before meals as recommended by your doctor to reduce the chance of low blood sugar. You and your doctor should talk about a plan to treat low blood sugar. You should have fast-acting sugar (such as hard candy, glucose tablets, juice) or glucagon with you at all times. Call your doctor if you have low blood sugar more often than normal or severe low blood sugar. Your chance for low blood sugar is higher if you: do not reduce your insulin dose before meals at the beginning of SYMLIN treatment, as directed by your doctor. use more SYMLIN or insulin than prescribed by your doctor. change your insulin dose without checking your blood sugar. eat less food than your usual meal. are sick and cannot eat. are more active than usual. have a low blood sugar level before eating. drink alcohol. Nausea : Nausea is the most common side effect with SYMLIN. Mild nausea is more likely during the first weeks after starting SYMLIN and us ually does not last long. It is very important to start SYMLIN at a low dose and increase it as directed by your doctor. See \"How should I use SYMLIN?\" If nausea continues or bothers you, call your doctor right away. Other Side Effects : SYMLIN also may cause the following side effects: decreased appetite, vomiting, stomach pain, tiredness, dizziness, or indigestion. SYMLIN also can cause reactions at the injecti on site including redness, minor bruising, or pain. Follow the directions under \"How should I use SY MLIN?\" to reduce the chance of an injection site reaction. Tell your doctor if you have any side effects that bother you or that do not go away. These are not all the side effects with SYMLIN. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information. 813005-EE NDA 21-332 Page 6 813005-EE How should I store SYMLIN?

All rights reserved. Insulin Simplifying one of the most misunderstood medications of all time. By Wil Dubois It's clearer than water from an alpine mountain spring. It's as expensive as French perfume. It's nearly 100 years old. It's been blessed, cursed, feared, and loved. Virtually all animals have it, or something very much like it. Horses have it. Dogs have it. Mice have it. Fish have it. So too do earthworms, fruit flies, and mosquitos. It's insulin . In the Body From the perspective of biology, insulin is the elixir of the Fountain of Life. OK, well, technically it's a peptide hormone, meaning that it's a functional pr otein\u2014 a protein engineered by nature to carry out a specific task. If you want to get even more technical about it, insulin is composed of 51 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 5808. In \"normal\" people and critters, insulin is produced by the body's pancreas . The hormone's job is to guide glucose molecules from the blood stream into individual cells, earning it the title of a \"transport hormone.\" Insulin is a navigator, hunting guide, and traffic cop all rolled into one. If your body fails to produce insulin you have type 1 diabetes , and your blood sugar rapidly skyrockets with potentially deadly effect. If your body produces insulin \u2014but not enough for its needs because of insulin resistance\u2014you have type 2 diabetes , and your blood sugar slowly skyrockets, but still with potentially deadly effect. In the Bottle From the perspective of diabetes therapy, insulin is the ultimate medicine. It always works. It gets along well with other medications . There is no maximum safe amount. It has virtually no side effects \u2014it won't make you cough, ache, burp, or have diarrhea. It's infinitely scalable. It's simple, safe, and natural. Insulin has a long track record, too. It was \"discovered\" and synthesized nearly a century ago by Dr. Frederick Banting and his assistant Charles Best working at the University of Toronto. Over the decades since, insulin has had a number of makeovers, but it's the same basic molecule. It was originally distilled from ground- up animal pancreases, generally from cows and pigs. In recent decades \"human\" insulin has been grown in massive production plants, using either yeast or E.coli bacteria. It has come in a variety of \"strengths,\" and over time various chemicals have been added to slow down its action or speed to it up. So while over the years it has featured different lights, bells, and whistles, it remains the same basic medicine. But I don't want to talk about the body's insulin today. I want to talk about insulin in a bottle. Who Needs Insulin? Everyone, of course. But I guess you were asking which people with diabetes need insulin from a bottle. Actually, the answer is the same: everyone. Now all type 1's need insulin right out of the gate. I think most people know that. Our bodies don't make any at all and to stay alive we must import insulin from outside to keep the sugar in our blood in check. But what is less well known is that virtually all type 2s \u2014in the fullness of time\u2014will also need insulin from outside. The reason for this is simple: Type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease. It gets worse and worse and worse over time. Pills will only go so far. Eventually, most type 2s who live long enough will need insulin. So, given the natural course of diabetes and the almost guaranteed need for insulin, why do so many people freak out about taking it? Well, it might be that taking insulin involves needles. Why a Needle? Insulin needs to be injected. Why? Why can't we have a pill? Well, remember that I told you that it's actually a protein? So if you put it in a pill, your stomach mistakes it for a T - bone steak and digests it. Trust me, pharma companies big and small are working night and day on a work -around to put insulin into a pill, but with no great success yet. OK, why can't we have a patch? Well, remember that I told you insulin has an atomic weight of 5808? In plain English that means it has a very big butt. It's a huge mongo molecule. Too big, in fact, to fit through your skin. That's why nothing happens if you pour insulin onto your hands. But again, the friendly pharma folks are working on ways to stretch the skin to force the molecules in. But don't hold your breath. The I -patch is years away. In the meantime, to get insulin through your skin and into your body without being digested, a needle is involved. That needle might be attached to an ol' fashioned insulin syringe, something called an insulin pen , or to an insulin pump. Page: 1 | 2 Last Modified Date: May 03, 2013 Insulin (Continued) Syringes, Pens, and Pumps, Oh My! I think everyone knows what a syringe is: It's a tube designed to hold a liquid, a plunger to draw the liquid into the tube and push it out again, and a needle to break the human skin to get the liquid where it needs to go. Once upon a time, only a few decades ago, syringes were glass and metal affairs that had to be boiled between uses, and needles were giant stainless steel harpoons that had to be sharpened on whetstones like knives. Now we have disposable plastic one- shot syringes with high -tech needles the size of a human eyelash. Syringes are the traditional way to deliver insulin, and are still commonly in use in the USA today. In some parts of this country, and in most of the rest of the civilized world, the syringe has been replaced by the pen. An insulin pen is a fountain pen- sized multi -shot device with a tiny screw cap needle on one end and a dial to set a dose on the other end. They come in both pre- filled disposable varieties, and in sturdy metal beauties that can be refilled. Lastly, an insulin pump is an alternative way to get insulin into the body. It's a high- tech computerized device that automates some, but not all, of insulin delivery. Instead of one big shot, pumps continuously infuse small amounts of insulin into your body all of the time. A Good Girl with a Bad Reputation Now in all fairness, insulin cannot be said to be n either feminine nor masc uline, but it's certainly one of the most misunderstood medications of all time. I say that because many people are terrified of going \"on\" insulin. Is it just the needle? After all, sticking yourself with a needle is arguably an unnatural (but nowadays painless) act. No, fear of needles isn't the whole story. Because if we look at other injectable diabetes medications like Byetta and Victoza , there's very little resistance from dFolk to taking these meds, which also require needles. So ,does the lure of weight loss overcome the fear of needles, or is there something else going on? How did insulin get such a bum rep? The answer: Stupid doctors. For decades many docs tried to control their patients' behavior by using fear. They'd hold up the vial and syringe like a baseball bat: \"You'd better do what I tell you or I'll have to put you on the needle.\" (A rather short -sighte d motivational technique given that the natural history of diabetes shows us nearly everyone with diabetes will end up on insulin at some point.) Thus, used as a threat, insulin became the de facto medication of last resort. Often the elixir of life was delayed too long. Historically, by the time many type 2s were started on insulin, complications had already set in. Families remembered that grandma was put on insulin and then went blind. Families remembered that grandpa was put on insulin and then his feet were cut off. Avoid insulin: that stuff will kill you! It was the combination of these three factors that ended up giving insulin a bad rep that the best PR firm in the world would have a hard time overcoming. First, doctors in the past used insulin as a threat, creating an atmosphere of fear around the best diabetes medicine in the pharmacy. Second, in most cases, it was started far too late in the disease process, after the damage was already done. If grandma and grandpa had been started on inulin a decade earlier they'd be alive and kicking (with both feet) today. Third, type 2 diabetes is commonly inter -generational: And families have pretty good memories. More about that last one in a minute. Insulin Today Luckily, the vast majority of the medical community has \"gotten with the program.\" Insulin isn't held over patient's heads as a threat anymore. It's started in a timely manner now. In some practices it's viewed as a medicine of first resort, not of last resort. Most patients are told that insulin is in the cards from the very day they are diagnosed. The natural progression of diabetes is carefully laid out so that no fear or self-blame need exist down the road. Still, family lore ,... that's not so easily changed. The mythologies, memories, misgivings and outright fear of insulin generated by the dark history of insulin's use will take much more time to cure. But hopefully not the next 100 years of insulin's history. Wil Dubois is the author of four multi -award- winning books about diabetes. He is a PWD type 1, and is the diabetes coordinator for a rural non- profit clinic. Visit his blog, LifeAfterDX . MEDS 43 TOUJEO (t pens contain insulin glargine (lantus) in a stronger concentration than Lantus. The normal Lantus Solostar uses U -100 insulin, meaning there is 100 units of insulin per ml or cc or the 1.0 mark on a syringe. The Toujeo insulin is U -300 insulin so is three times as strong. The idea is that you use a smaller dose of insulin that is absorbed more evenly from the depot where the dose was put. It has a more even profile than Lantus and less hypoglycemia. Touje o is not for treating DKA and it is not used in children yet. Never share your pen. Do not take if you are having low blood sugar. The dose counter on the Toujeo is exactly what your provider tells you to take. Since the pen is what makes the calculations for being 3 times stronger, you would not use a syringe for this insulin. Do not reuse pen needles, and remove the needle from the pen when dosing is done. Do not store with pen needle on the Solostar pen. Use Toujeo at the same time each day. Rotate where you dose within the abdomen or to an arm, upper outer thigh, or upper buttocks can be used. NEVER mix this insulin with any other insulin. Check your blood sugar regularly to see effects. Remember, the food, exercise, emotions and illness can a ll effect your glucose levels. It is suggested to not drive or operate heavy equipment until you know the effect that Toujeo has. Side effects: Low blood sugars are possible, severe allergic reactions, low potassium, heart failure if used with TZD's (Actos). Medication Guide Rx Only AFREZZA\u00ae (uh-FREZZ-uh) (insulin human) inhalation powder What is the most important information I should know about AFREZZA? AFREZZA can cause serious side effects, including: Sudden lung problems (bronchospasms). Do not use AFREZZA if you have long-term (chronic) lung problems such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Before starting AFREZZA, your healthcare provider will give you a breathing test to check how your lungs are working. What is AFREZZA? AFREZZA is a man-made insulin that is breathed-in through your lungs (inhaled) and is used to control high blood sugar in adults with diabetes mellitus. AFREZZA is not for use in place of long-acting insulin. AFREZZA must be used with long-acting insulin in people who have type 1 diabetes mellitus. AFREZZA is not for use to treat diabetic ketoacidosis. It is not known if AFREZZA is safe and effective for use in people who smoke. AFREZZA is not for use in people who smoke or have recently stopped smoking (less than 6 months). It is not known if AFREZZA is safe and effective in children under 18 years of age. Who should not use AFREZZA? Do not use AFREZZA if you: have chronic lung problems such as asthma or COPD. are allergic to regular human insulin or any of the ingredients in AFREZZA. See the end of this Medication Guide for a complete list of ingredients in AFREZZA. What should I tell my healthcare provider before using AFREZZA? Before using AFREZZA, tell your healthcare provider about all your medical conditions, including if you: have lung problems such as asthma or COPD have or have had lung cancer are using any inhaled medications smoke or have recently stopped smoking have kidney or liver problems are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or are breastfeed- ing. AFREZZA may harm your unborn or breastfeeding baby. Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins or herbal supplements. Before you start using AFREZZA, talk to your healthcare provider about low blood sugar and how to manage it. How should I use AFREZZA? Read the detailed Instructions for Use that comes with your AFREZZA. Take AFREZZA exactly as your healthcare provider tells you to. Your healthcare provider should tell you how much AFREZZA to use and when to use it. Know the strength of AFREZZA you use.

Signs and symptoms that may indicate low blood sugar include: dizziness or light-headedness, sweating, confusion, head- ache, blurred vision, slurred speech, shakiness, fast heart- beat, anxiety, irritability or mood change, hunger. decreased lung function. Your healthcare provider should check how your lungs are working before you start using AFREZZA, 6 months after you start using it and yearly after that. lung cancer. In studies of AFREZZA in people with diabetes, lung cancer occurred in a few more people who were taking AFREZZA than in people who were taking other diabetes medications. There were too few cases to know if lung cancer was related to AFREZZA. If you have lung cancer, you and your healthcare provider should decide if you should use AFREZZA. diabetic ketoacidosis. Talk to your healthcare provider if you have an illness. Your AFREZZA dose or how often you check your blood sugar may need to be changed. severe allergic reaction (whole body reaction). Get medical help right away if you have any of these signs or symp- toms of a severe allergic reaction: a rash over your whole body, trouble breathing, a fast heartbeat, or sweating. low potassium in your blood (hypokalemia). heart failure. Taking certain diabetes pills called thiazolidin- ediones or TZDs with AFREZZA may cause heart failure in some people. This can happen even if you have never had heart failure or heart problems before. If you already have heart failure it may get worse while you take TZDs with AFREZZA. Your healthcare provider should monitor you closely while you are taking TZDs with AFREZZA. Tell your healthcare provider if you have any new or worse symptoms of heart failure including: shortness of breath, swelling of your ankles or feet, sudden weight gain. Treatment with TZDs and AFREZZA may need to be changed or stopped by your healthcare provider if you have new or worse heart failure. Get emergency medical help if you have: trouble breathing, shortness of breath, fast heartbeat, swelling of your face, tongue, or throat, sweating, extreme drowsiness, dizziness, confusion. The most common side effects of AFREZZA include: low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), cough, sore throat These are not all the possible side effects of AFREZZA.

Save time with your new insulin patients and let them know what is available. Print out this handout and give to each patient. Insulin Delivery ChoicesAdvertisement Insulin Delivery Devices More and more of our patients are going on insulin as their diabetes needs more control. We are all familiar with using vials and syringes but the chances for error, es-pecially in our older patients is great. A study done by Novo-Nordisk in 1999 showed that medical professionals have a 40% error rate in drawing up doses of less than 10 units in a 1cc syringe. Can you imagine how far off patients could be. We have multiple choices when it comes to deliver devices, some you have and some you can learn more about. Syringe choices can make a difference. There are 3/10cc, \u00bd cc and 1 cc sizes and the needles come in 28-31 gauge and different lengths. The choice of a 3/10cc syringe for a patient using 13 units allows the patient to be over 60% more accurate. Then there are the Pen Devices . These offer your patients accuracy, convenience and anywhere use.There are disposable devices, as well as reusable devices and knowing which one to recommend can make a difference for your patient. Novo makes the FlexPens including Levemir, a near peakless long acting insulin Novolog, a rapid acting insu- lin and NovoMix 70/30 a combination of both rapid and long acting insulin. All of these come 5 pens in a box and offer 300 units in each disposable pen. They use pen needles from either NOVO or B-D. The pens can be kept out of the refrigerator for 30 -35 days after first use. Sanofi makes pens and refillables for both their near peakless insulin Lantus. There is no device currently available for their rapid acting insulin Apidra. The Solostar comes in a box of 5 disposal pens 300 units each. This is a great thing for patients using a low dose as each pen is good for 30 days after opening. The Opticlick pen uses a special cartridge with the plunger screw built in, and unofficially is be-ing phased out by the company. Eli Lilly has been making their \"Turbo\" pen for the past 10 years. They still make Humulin N and R as well as Humalog, Humalog 75/25 and Humalog 50/50. Since a lot of our patients are having to pay cash for their insulin the use of Humulin insulins reduces cost. Lilly recently added 5 new pens to their lineup the first that came out is the HumaPen Memoir. This device uses the 3ml Humalog Cartridge and has a digital readout. Each dose is stored digitally with the time and date when given. The device stores the last 16 doses and is great for patients who are forgetful and might dose twice. For patients, especially children, who need smaller doses of insulin the HumaPen Luxura HD is a great choice. This device uses the same 300 u cartridge and delivers accurate \u00bd units of insulin. The cartridges come in a box of 5 300u cartridges just like the disposable pens. The new KwikPen is their brand new disposal pen. It is available in Humalog, Huma - log 75/25 and Humalog 50/50. This new pen has an easier to read dial, a short throw distance and is a great improvement over the \"turbo\" pen. The pen is available in boxes of 5 pens with 300 units. Each pen is good for at least 30 day without refrigeration after the first use. If your patients want to try any of the Lilly Pens have then just go to http://kwikpenvoucher.humalog.com/ voucher.cfm and print a coupon for a 5 pack. Pen Needles All pens need needles and the selection of these are varied as well. The 2 most popular brands are B-D and Novo but others are available as well. Often we assume that the smallest finest needle is the best for our pa - tients but depending on the thickness and density of a patient's adipose tissue a longer or thicker needle may be necessary. BD Ultra-Fine needles come in 3 different sizes Mini Pen Needle at 5mm and 31 gauge Short Pen Needle at 8mm and 31 gauge Original Pen Needle at 12.7mm and 29 gauge NovoFine Disposable Pen Needles come in 2 different sizes 31 Gauge x 6 mm 30 Gauge x 8 mm Infusion Ports Many of our patients use 4-6 injections a day and even more need to increase their injections but don't want to stick themselves due to the pain or bruising that can occur. For those patients there is the I-Port altThis device is inserted in the skin every 3 days and then the shot given with a pen or a syringe is given thru the port. So whether it is 3 shots or 5 shots a day the skin is only pierced once every 3 days.

For example, it can be the type of diabetes medicine you take, the site you use to inject into, the needle you use, and/or your technique. Let's take a look at more reasons associated with your site that can cause erratic absorption of insulin. When you were first taught how to take an insulin injection, you may have been taught to rotate sites. Maybe you weren't or maybe you just got in the habit of injecting one or two places. When you inject in the same place, over time, you may develop one of three types of skin irregularities due to changes in your subcutaneous fat. (1) The three types are: Lipohypertrophy. Also known as fat hypertrophy or insulin hypertrophy. \"Lipo\" stands for fat and the word hypertrophy means excessive growth. Lipohypertophy looks like \"grape- like\" lumps under your injection sites. They can feel hard and/or rubbery to touch. It can be caused by insulin itself when repeated injections or insulin at the insulin pump infusion site can cause fat to grow, and by reusing needles. Scarring of fat. This appears like the areas of hypertrophy but harder. This can be caused by overusing a site, reusing needles, and at insulin pump infusion sites that are not changed often enough. Fat scarring can be confused with lipohypertrophy, but they are different. Lipoatrophy. Also known as fat atr ophy. The word \"atrophy\" means the wasting away of a part of the body. (3) It can be caused by insulin, usually impure insulin like the old beef and pork insulins. We don't see it as often now that we have purer insulins, but it can happen with these and at insulin pump sites. (4) It appears as a loss of fat or \"dips or dimples\" in your skin and has a firm, not soft bouncy texture as it should. Some people choose to keep injecting insulin in these sites because the sites are usually less painful or it's just become a habit to inject in these areas. Using these sites or sometimes using them causes glucose variability because, depending where you inject, there can be different absorption of insulin, and different blood glucose levels. What you get is the unexpected blood sugar roller coaster. Remember, these problems are caused by many factors. Some you have control over, some you don't: 1. How long you've been injecting insulin. The longer you have been injecting, the higher your risk. Not controllable. 2. Not rotating insulin injection sites. Using the same site over and over can increase your risk. Controllable. 3. How often you change your needles. Reusing needles can increase your risk. Controllable. 4. Not changing your infusion sites often enough. Contr ollable. 5. Using impure insulins. Controllable. Recommendations to Prevent These Problems Feel your sites before you inject, to avoid injecting into these problem areas, unless otherwise instructed by your diabetes health care professional. Use all 4 injection sites: -Abdomen -Arm -Thigh -Buttocks Use a larger site \"surface\" areas, and change to a new site each week Rotate injections within each site by 1 centimeter (about \u00bd inch) between each injection Use a new needle each time you inject If you wear a pump, follow the above recommendations and change your site more frequently Use pure insulins, such as human and/or insulin analogs as prescribed by your diabetes health care professional Stay tuned for more to come about l ittle-known reasons that could be causing your blood sugar to be all over the place. If you have been using sites which have lipohypertrophy, scars, or lipoatrophy, to inject into, and decide to switch injection sites, talk with your diabetes health care t eam to find out if you need to change the amount of insulin you take since you may have better absorption. When Did I Take Insulin? Tracking insulin injections decreases risk of lows By Bennet Dunlap Starting insulin injections can be stressful. Life has a way of making things routine and injecting insulin can become one. In many ways, that is a good thing. Getting into the habit of taking insulin regularly can help keep diabetes in check. As taking insulin becomes routine, it is more difficult to remember. Not remembering how much or when insulin was taken can lead to taking too much and dangerous lows can be the outcome. Insulin is taken to cover food and correct for high blood sugar. Often people do both at the same time. Insulin takes time to lower blood sugar. If you eat more carbohydrates , more insulin is needed to cover that additional food. The last blood sugar correction may still be working and so an additional correction may not be needed, depending on how recently the correction was taken. A correction on top of a still working correction is called \"stacking insulin.\" Stacking may lead to a risky low blood sugar. When insuli n injections become habit, it is more possible to stack insulin simply as a matter of routine and forgetting when that last injection was. There are tools that can help you remember. Understanding safe insulin practices and professional help in choosing t he right tools for you life style are critical. Like most issues with diabetes, the most important first step is good education. So talk with your diabetes educator about how to avoid stacking insulin. Insulin pump users very likely have an algorithm to track insulin on board or IOB. These pump calculations typically reduce suggested insulin doses to account for IOB. Your pump trainer or support team can help you understand the details of how to make the most of insulin on board calculations. Most people who take insulin do not use pumps. They inject with syringes or pens. Some pens have electronic memory to track the last dose. The NovoPen Echo is one option that is available in the United States. Pens are a more popular choice around the world and more options are available in other countries. These include pens by Lillyand Timesulin's timer cap that fits onto insulin existing pens. Accu -Chek offers insulin injection patients the Aviva Expert meter that combines blood sugar measurement with the IOB tracking and bolus calculating similar to what is offered in pumps. There is technology that can help remember when and how much insulin was injected to help support a successful diabetes management routine. If you think one may help you, start by talking with you care professional to better understand the options available and how they may complement your lifestyle. Read Bennet's bio here.

In addition to evaluating numerous consumer complaints, FDA surveyed the marketplace for illegally sold products promising to treat dia - betes and its complications. In July 2013, FDA issued letters warn - ing 15 companies about selling prod - ucts for diabetes in violation of federal law. These products are sold as dietary supplements; alternative medicines, such as ayurvedics; prescription drugs and over-the-counter drugs, includ - ing homeopathic products: Examples of claims observed on these illegally marketed products include: \"Lower your blood sugar naturally.\" \"Lowers A1C levels significantly.\" \"You'll lower your chances of having eye disease, kidney disease, nerve damage and heart disease!\" \"It can replace medicine in the treatment of diabetes.\" \"For Relief of Diabetic Foot Pain.\" Some of the companies also pro - mote unapproved products for other serious diseases, including cancer, sexually transmitted diseases, and macular degeneration. FDA tested products marketed as \"all natural\" treatments for diabetes and discovered some of them con - tained one or more active ingredients found in prescription drugs to treat type 2 diabetes. Undeclared ingredients can cause serious harm. If consumers and their health care professionals are unaware of the actual ingredients in the prod - ucts they are taking, these products may interact in dangerous ways with other medications. One possible com - plication: Patients may end up taking a larger combined dose of the diabetic drugs than they intended, and that may cause a significant unsafe drop in blood sugar levels, a condition known as hypoglycemia. FDA also looked at sales of pre - scription drugs from fraudulent online pharmacies. Signs that indi - cate an online pharmacy is legiti - mate include: requiring that patients have a valid prescription; providing a physical address in the U.S.; being licensed by a state pharmacy board; and having a state-licensed pharma - cist to answer questions. Some fraud - ulent online pharmacies illegally sell drugs that are not approved in the United States, or sell prescription drug products without meeting nec - essary requirements. One website that is subject to a warning letter shipped a prescrip - tion diabetes drug without requiring a prescription, and even included an unsolicited free sample of a prescrip - tion drug for erectile dysfunction. Moreover, the prescription diabe - tes drug was dispensed without the medication guide and other precau - tions required by FDA to ensure the drug is used safely and appropriately. Although some of these websites may offer for sale what appear to be FDA-approved prescription drugs, FDA cannot confirm that the manu - facture or the handling of these drugs follows U.S. regulations or that the drugs are safe and effective for their intended uses. Also, there is a risk the drugs may be counterfeit, contami - nated, expired or otherwise unsafe. A Far-Reaching Problem There are 26 million people in the U.S. who have diabetes, including about 7 million who are undiag - nosed, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Mil-lions more have pre-diabetes, mean - ing they have higher than normal blood sugar levels and can reduce their risks of developing diabetes through healthy lifestyle changes, including diet and exercise. \"Products that promise an easy fix might be alluring, but consumers are gambling with their health. In gen -eral, diabetes is a chronic disease, but it is manageable and people can lower their risk for developing complica - tions by following treatments pre - scribed by health care professionals, carefully monitoring blood sugar lev - els, and sticking to an appropriate diet and exercise program,\" said Coody.

Wearable glucose meters and insulin pumps are currently being investigated to work together as an \"artificial pancreas,\" but there seems to be a limit to how fast changes in blood sugar can be detected and proper insulin dosages delivered. Now a collaboration between North Carolina State University, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, MIT, and Boston Children's Hospital has developed and is analyzing a new material that can encapsulate insulin and release it as needed into the blood stream. Made of chitosan, a substance often found in the shells of crustaceans, with a bit of chemical trickery the material expands in the presence of high concentrations of glucose, allowing insulin to flow out and immediately counteract the sugar rush. As glucose levels return to normal, th e sponge-like material contracts and stops the flow of insulin. This technique essentially replicates the functionality of -cells within the pancreas, but further research needs to confirm the safety and efficacy of this technology within diabetic patients. Moreover, the technique allows for other therapeutic compounds to be delivered in response to certain biomarkers, potentially allowing for more targeted treatment of cancer and other diseases. More details from North Carolina State: The researchers created a spherical, sponge-like matrix out of chitosan, a material found in shrimp and crab shells. Scattered throughout this matrix are smaller nanocapsules made of a porous polymer that contain glucose oxidase or catalase enzymes. The sponge-like matrix surrounds a reservoir that contains insulin. The entire matrix sphere is ap proximately 250 micrometers in diameter and can be injected into a patient. As the insulin is released, the body's glucose levels begin to drop. This causes the chitosan to lose its positive charge, and the strands begin to come back together. This shrinks the size of th e pores in the sponge, trapping the remaining insulin.When a diabetic patient's blood sugar rises, the glucose Page 1 of 2 Medgadget.com Glucose Sensing Sponge Delivers Insulin Precisely When and Where Neede d 8/4/2017 mhtml:file://D:\\Electronic format of patient materials\\MEDS 40 Med g Sponge Delivers Insulin Prec i...Copyright \u00a9 Medgadget LLC. All rights reserved.triggers a reaction that causes the nanocapsules' enzymes to release hydrogen ions. Those ions bind to the molecular strands of the chitosan sponge, giving them a positive charge. The positively charged chitosan strands then push away from each other, creating larger gaps in the sponge's pores that allow the insulin to escape into the bloodstream. In type 1 and advanced type 2 diabetes, the body needs injections of insulin, a horm one that transports glucose - or blood sugar - from the bloodstream into the body's cells. While this work created hydrogen ions by using enzymes that are responsive to glucose, the technique could be simplified to target cancers by eliminating the enzymes alto gether. Tumors are acidic environments that have high concentrations of hydrogen ions. If the sponge reservoir were filled with anticancer drugs, the drugs would be released when the chitosan came into contact with the hydrogen ions in tumor tissues or cancer cells.

Report: FDA comfortable with EMA's diabetes conclusions July 31 2013 Regulatory concern that diabetes medications known as incretin mimetics could be linked to pancreatic cancer may have eased a bit. Trade publication BioCentury is reporting that the FDA \"concurs\" with the European Medicines Agency that the medications and disease are not linked. The EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use announced July 26 that \"presently available data do not confirm recent concerns over an increased risk of pancreatic adverse events with these medicines.\" The drugs in question include GLP-1 inhibitors like Novo Nordisk's Victoza, as well as DPP -IV drugs like Merck's Januvia. The FDA was not able to confirm the report at press time. [ UPDATE : The FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research tells MM&M that the regulator and the EMA had been in touch regarding the EMA's analyses, and says \"our general view is that their conclusions are consistent with our current understanding of the data.\" C DER says the FDA also says the current GLP -1 labels reflect \"the extent of our understanding of the safety signals at this point in time.\" The FDA's GLP -1 study is ongoing, and CDER says an epidemiological study is also in the works.] CHMP's issue was that the data which appeared to indicate a link had limitations and an underlying potential for bias, as well as differences in age, gender and disease duration among the test subjects, all of which the regulator wrote \"preclude a meaningful interpretation of the results.\" ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum told MM&M at the time that the read -through in terms of the potential impact this decision could have on the US was unclear, but that it wasn't a bad thing. In a July 26 investor note, he called the concern a \"$3 hole\" in Merck shares, and wrote today that BioCentury 's news makes him consider \"this overhang as largely dead.\" Merck's Tuesday Q2 earnings call did not indicate any concern about the EMA's scrutiny, or even its recent conclusion that fear surrounding DPP -IVs was overrated. In fact, sales of the Januvia and Janumet rose during the quarter, before the EMA weighed in. Further, Merck noted that generics don't pose a threat to these DPP -IVs because these drugs are generally used as a second-line treatment for patients who aren't able to adequately control their condition with cheaper metformin. The lack of a clear financial impact should not be surprising -- the American Diabetes Association told MM&M in March that it had not been flooded with patient calls . Leerink Swann analyst Seamus Fernandez was also unperturbed by the report, writing in February \"we are skeptical that this study a lone will have any meaningful impact on use of these therapies.\" Search THE TIMESULIN PEN CA P - A SIMPLE SOLUTION TO A BIG PR OBLEM, \"WHEN DID I LAST TAKE MY INSULIN?\" 5/29/15 - NEW NOW NEXT Share this Article TAGS Twitter summary: A crowdfunding success brings @Timesulin, an insulin pen dose timing cap, to the US, selling at $34.99 Timesulin , a pen cap to help patients remember how long it's been since their last dose of insulin, is now available in the US after raising an impressive $36,189 from a crowdfunding campaign . This is welcome news for patients on injections and comes after Timesulin's popularity in 40 other countries. Anyone interested can visit this link to purchase the Timesulin cap, which costs $34.99 (free shipping in the US) and comes with a 30-day money back guarantee. Timesulin fits all major disposable insulin pens, including the Novo Nordisk Flexpen and FlexTouch , the Sanofi SoloSTAR , Kwikpen . A highlight of the Timesulin pen cap is the focus on ultra simplicity - the timer is built right into the pen cap, and it begins counting once a patient places the cap back on the insulin pen. It's easy to quickly see how long it's been since the last dose of insulin (i.e., the screen shows the clock and nothing else). After removing the cap, taking a dose of insulin, and putting it back on the pen, the clock resets to zero. The timer can count up to 100 hours since the last injection. The cap lasts for 12 months before it needs to be replaced, and it does not require charging. For a one-minute video of how Timesulin works, see its website here. Timesulin solves a very meaningful problem - When did I last inject insulin? - without adding any additional to burden to those using it. In 2013, a Novo Nordisk study suggested one in three people living with diabetes skip or incorrectly take an insulin dose three t imes per month, and that 77% of healthcare providers estimated this number was closer to six times per month. Novo Nordisk has also posted this nice infographic on the problems with insulin dose timing, citing as many as 93% of people with diabetes have problems remembering the timing of their insulin dosing. Timesulin's approach may help many patients remember to take their insulin, as well as avoid dangerous insulin \"stacking\" (taking too many doses too close to each other) that contributes to hypoglycemia. -AB - See more at: you by your diabetes educator and Drugs That Can Affect Blood Glucose Levels Drugs That May Cause Hyperglycemia (High Blood Sugar) Generic Name Brand sodium "}
