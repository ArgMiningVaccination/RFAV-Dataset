A neighbor complains about arthritis, yet feels perfectly healthy otherwise. A friend complains about feeling irritable, depressed and fatigued, but considers this as normal PMS symptoms. A relative is given a clean bill of health, yet he does not feel well at all. Health holds different meanings for different people, and yet it ranks high in importance for everyone. Health is a kind of freedom. Health allows a person to enjoy a long, full life without the need of drugs for hospitalization. Since everyone is constantly adapting to a changing environment, no one can enjoy optimal health all the time. Better stamina and overall health can be achieved just by living a healthy lifestyle, which supports the body's ability to restore and maintain its natural vitality and strength. Our body provides us with a natural ability to fend off illness physically, emotionally and mentally. When we are healthy, we are resistant to disease and recover quickly from injury, illness and emotional trauma. When this natural resistance breaks down, health declines. The weakness shows up as: - Recurrent infections - A greater sensitivity to stress - A noticeable drop in energy - Insomnia - Problems with digestion - gas and bloating, leaky gut - Skin problems - allergic dermatitis, acne, and psoriasis! - Musculoskeletal issues - low back pain, arthritis - Will eating junk destroy my immunity? - Although resistance to disease is highly individual, eating junk food once or twice, or missing a night's sleep or a few days of physical activity will not cause immunity to decline. Rather it is through years of mistreatment that the body's natural resistance can collapse leaving the body more susceptible to illness. BALANCE YOUR LIFESTYLE A balanced lifestyle is essential to achieving and maintaining overall health. The body's resistance rests largely on our individual choices about where to live, what to eat and how to find balance between challenging activity, stress and rest, as well as the cultivation of emotional and spiritual well being. In short, health is achieved when the body, mind and spirit are in balance. Supporting the body's natural need to maintain balance makes a remarkable difference in health.
