When this happens, it may cause you to feel lethargic, unfocused, and even depressed. By utilizing energy therapy techniques including Reiki, healing touch, and vibrational sound healing, your energy fields (chakras and aura) can come back into balance. When your energy system is balanced, you will feel relief from stress, anxiety, and depression issues. Energy therapy can also help you recover and detach from energy vampires and unhealthy relationships. Techniques can also be used to detach energy cords from past lives, remove entities attached to a person and remove curses (including curses from a past lifetime).
