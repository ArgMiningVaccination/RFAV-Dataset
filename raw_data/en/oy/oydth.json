Comirnaty contains tozinameran, a messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule with instructions for producing a protein from the original strain of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Comirnaty is also available as two adapted vaccines: - Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 contains tozinameran and riltozinameran, another mRNA molecule with instructions for producing a protein from the Omicron BA.1 subvariant famtozinameran, another mRNA molecule with instructions for producing a protein from the Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants of SARS-CoV-2. Comirnaty and its adapted vaccines do not contain the virus itself and cannot cause COVID-19. - List item Comirnaty : EPAR - Medicine overview (PDF/164.73 KB) (updated) First published: 23/12/2020 Last updated: 10/08/2023 messenger RNA produced using a cell-free in vitro transcription from the corresponding DNA templates, encoding the viral spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 |International non-proprietary name (INN) or common name|| | |Therapeutic area (MeSH)|| | COVID-19 virus infection |Anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) code|| | J07BN01 |Additional monitoring|| | This medicine is under additional monitoring, meaning that it is monitored even more intensively than other medicines.
