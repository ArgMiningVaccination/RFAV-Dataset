You are all such interesting and intelligent people and your kind words are very rewarding. Many of you have also inspired me to research topics I have not yet written about, am not too familiar with, or in some cases ones that I forgot I even knew about. Anthroposophic medicine is one of those topics. I was fortunate enough to receive an email from a lovely reader, [Sharonah, of Spa Holistica](http://www.spaholistica.com/about.html) in New York City with whom I happen to have a lot in common. She is received her holistic health coaching certification from the [same school as I](http://www.integrativenutrition.com/iinbook?erefer=0015000000aIkyZAAS), and she is also a licensed aesthetician with a holistic approach. We have many other interests in common as well and we decided we wanted to have a phone conversation. During our call, I learned that Sharonah is a Dr. Hauschka certified aesthetician. I had heard about these products many years ago through the Waldorf School crowd, and have seen them at health food stores and have heard rave reviews about them from many different people. Weleda products also stemmed from this community. Both brands are on my radar for future Product Spotlights. Anyway, the reason this is relevant is because Dr. Hauschka products originated from the teachings of Rudolf Steiner, who is also the rounder of the Waldorf education movement. We continued to talk a bit about Steiner, and Sharonah asked me if I had ever heard of anthroposophic medicine. I had heard the word ?anthroposophic? before, again in the Steiner/Waldorf circle of thought, but had not heard of the practice of anthroposophic medicine. A brief intro to Rudolf Steiner |Rudolf Steiner| While it is not possible to discuss Rudolf Steiner, [Waldorf education](http://www.steiner.edu/), or even anthroposophic medicine in one blog post, I can give you a quick rundown of who Steiner was and what he was about, so you can see why his movements (yes, more than one) continue to spread and gain momentum, especially in these days when people are starting to seek a more holistic, balanced approach to their health as well as their lives in general. [Rudolf Steiner](http://web.archive.org/web/20060220200816/http://www.newtimes.org/issue/0305/steiner.htm) lived in Germany in the late 1800s and early 1900s. To say he was a prolific teacher, writer, and lecturer is a huge understatement. Steiner was highly educated and deeply philosophical and taught about several topics back then that have inspired many of the issues we are still trying to adjust to and deal with today as a society: religion/spirituality, death/reincarnation, childhood development and psychology (Waldorf education), organic and biodynamic farming/agricultural practices, speech therapy and different forms of physical/mental/emotional rehabilitation, economics, politics, architecture, drama, medicine?the list goes on and on. He wrote so many books (more than 300) and gave so many lectures, all in German, that many have had a hard time grasping due to language barriers and issues with translation. What is anthroposophy? Anthroposophy was the term he coined that was meant to encompass all of his beliefs, and he formed the Anthroposophic Society (still active today) to continue his teachings. It is difficult to find a single simple definition for anthroposophy because it is not a simple or singular concept. However, in terms of anthroposophic medicine, I was able to find this [explanation](http://www.rudolfsteinerweb.com/Rudolf_Steiner_and_Anthropsophy.php): ?The results of the scientific method of research into the supersensible world founded by Rudolf Steiner?these are also known as \"Spiritual Science\" and are the necessary complement to Natural Science. They are the science of the supersensible constitution of man, of the spiritual beings in the nature and the cosmos, and they are also the extension of historical and other sciences?the application of the results gained through spiritual science in the practical life of the individual or of the community, for example, in education, medicine, curative education, pharmacy, agriculture, sociology, as well as the diverse branches of the arts.? What is anthroposophic medicine? While [anthroposophic medicine](http://www.paam.net/fileadmin/pdf/Anthroposophic-Medicine.pdf) is holistic in nature, it is not intended to be considered ?alternative? medicine. It is more of an extension of conventional medicine. Actually, only licensed MDs are eligible to receive the training necessary to practice anthroposophic medicine. This is actually kind of cool, because if you are lucky enough to have an anthroposophic doctor in your area, it is more likely that your health insurance will cover his or her services than those of a different type of holistic practitioner such as a [homeopath](http://www.holisticallyhaute.com/2011/04/defining-alternative-medicine.html) or [naturopathic](http://www.holisticallyhaute.com/2011/05/defining-alternative-medicine.html) doctor whose services and methods are not recognized as ?medicine? by insurance companies. Anthroposophic medicine is based on the most current medical science and the findings of scientific research. Western allopathic medicine takes this research and the drugs developed from this research and uses it to diagnose diseases based on symptoms alone. Instead, anthroposophic medicine takes this research and applies it in different ways based on the complex needs of each individual whole person. Each symptom or illness means something different to each person, and different people react differently to different treatments based on many factors: physical, psychological, nutrition and lifestyle, spiritual beliefs, etc. Anthroposophic doctors take all of these factors into consideration, and treat each patient individually combining ?scientific findings, medical experience, personal discernment, and intuition? with various therapies such as breathing, sound and movement (eurythmy) and other therapies. [Anthroposophic medicines](http://www.paam.net/fileadmin/pdf/Anthroposophic-Medicines.pdf) are used when necessary, and are very different from conventional drugs. They are plant-based, and come in different forms (homeopathic concentrations, whole extracts, etc), and are produced at a pharmaceutical company in Germany according to pharmacopoeial standards of quality. Here is [how these medicines differ from conventional drugs: ](http://www.paam.net/anthroposophic-medicine.html) ?Where conventional medicine concentrates solely on destroying the agents of disease, suppressing associated processes and replacing missing substances (e.g. vitamins, hormones, blood elements), anthroposophic medicine, wherever possible and sensible, aims to enable the human organism to overcome a disease through its own resources. The emphasis is on restoring the balance of bodily functions and strengthening the forces of individualization and autonomy in the organism.?? These medicines are used successfully in healing the majority of the cases, but allopathic measures are taken when absolutely necessary. Anthroposophic medicine encourages patient responsibility. My favorite part of this branch of medicine is that patients are encouraged to take responsibility, ownership, and accountability in their own care. They are also considered to be equal partners in the process, and their intelligence, individuality, and time are respected. [In ](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CDNEG-PpSFw/T0PzVYlIQ6I/AAAAAAAABNw/2pEGt_lQGB0/s1600/anthro+med.jpg) [my own search for a new primary care provider](http://www.holisticallyhaute.com/2012/02/old-school-hh-my-favorite-rants-about.html) that my insurance company will cover, I have found some doctors who practice integrative, osteopathic, and functional medicine, and have also found two anthroposophic doctors who are not too far away?that's the problem. None of these doctors are convenient. So I will be narrowing down my choices and doing more research about each one to see who might be a good fit for my needs, but in the meantime, I am going to continue my efforts to make my immune system as strong as it can be so that my defend itself from bacteria and viruses and heal itself on its own without the need for medical care. *Image 2 from [RudolfSteinerWeb.com](http://www.rudolfsteinerweb.com/), image 3 from [Community Supported Anthroposophical Medicine](http://www.steinerhealth.org/csam/), image 4 from [Patients "}
