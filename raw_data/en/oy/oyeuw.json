We were so excited to have over 60 people attend! We agreed to speak on the connection between the gut & immune system, as we know how deeply interwoven they are. We shared a lot of information in just a short time. So although this is not comprehensive, here is a portion of our presentation: In Chinese Medicine, the relationship between the Lung (immune) and Large Intestine (gut) meridians: Ways to care for the Large Intestine: - Maintain regular bowel movements through diet and exercise (and if needed, acupuncture & herbs) - Eat foods that are warm and easy to digest (temperature is important to gut) Steam vegetables as opposed to eating them raw (only eat raw in spring and summer) - Be careful with food combinations: Protein, fat, complex carb at every meal. Protein the size of your palm, carbs the size of your fist, fats the size of your thumb. See \"Game On Diet\" by Krista Vernoff - Eat slowly & intentionally. Chew thoroughly. Lung Meridian = - Practice deep breathing - Avoid toxic substances that are inhaled (toxic candles (lead and paraffin which is a petroleum biproduct), fumes, toxic household products) - Cardio exercise (strengthen lung and increase capacity) - Break a sweat (releases toxins) - Keep neck covered in wind/cold/rain - Good foods: Rice, carrot, sweet potatoe, ginger, garlic, seaweeds, fibrous foods such as apples & oats - Not so good foods: Heavy dairy, excessive citrus From Dr. Nicoloff's slides: Healing Leaky Gut There is a simple solution to help transform unhealthy intestinal function back to health: L. acidophilus NCFM / B. lactis BI-07 = probiotics to balance immune function, combat microbial overgrowth, improve lactose digestion, reduce bowel distress. Nutritional & Botanical Therapeutics= I feel so fortunate to have found such a great doctor who takes time with each of his patients and has a background in holistic medicine. And between acupuncture visits and supplements/herbs, the immune & digestive system can be truly repaired. Those who think they have no time for healthy eating will sooner or later have to find time for illness.\" -Edward Stanley (1826-1893) from The Conduct of Life | | "}
