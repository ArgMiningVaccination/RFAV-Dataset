Why? Because many of us associate it with concepts like the meaning of life, religion, the afterlife, and other complex topics. However, it doesn't have to be and it's easy to learn spirituality for beginners. It doesn't matter if you aren't spiritually inclined because your spirituality is yours and yours alone. It's defined by you, so you don't have to worry about your preconceived thoughts on spirituality to begin your own spiritual journey. What is Spirituality for Beginners? While your own spirituality is unique, in general, [spirituality is defined as a connection to something bigger ](https://www.takingcharge.csh.umn.edu/what-spirituality)than ourselves, something universally experienced by humans. While it's often associated with the true meaning of life, spirituality can be related to your purpose as a mother, father, teacher, or anything else. Spirituality relates to the connection to the world around you and how you can live your life accordingly. It doesn't have to relate to a final meaning of life, creator, or afterlife...it could simply be your connection to other people, to nature, to your ethics, or to your self-reflection and mindfulness. That's why tapping into your emotionally healthy spirituality will be 100% unique to you. You may not think you are a spiritual person simply because you don't know how to become spiritual in your own way. Instead of focusing on how other, more spiritually inclined people do it, concentrate on your own version of spirituality.

But that can also be something that prevents you from knowing how to find yourself spiritually because you may think it has to be perfect. It doesn't. Simply forming connections and [building healthy relationships with others](https://mind-bar.com/improve-relationship-dynamics/) can promote emotionally healthy spirituality. Write in a Journal A big part of becoming a spiritual person is self-awareness and introspection. To cultivate an understanding of yourself, try writing in a journal every day. Write what you find meaningful in the small things...what did you do that day that made you feel fulfilled? If you didn't find something meaningful, write why you think that is. In addition, try to express gratitude daily in your journal as well... [doing so encourages happiness. ](https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/giving-thanks-can-make-you-happier) Try Meditation Mindfulness meditation is one of the most popular aspects of spirituality for beginners because it's easy, scientifically proven to promote well-being, and easy to fit into a busy schedule. All you need is 5 to 10 minutes a day to sit in silence without interruption. Focus on your breathing and watch your thoughts pass without judgment. If you get distracted, refocus on your breathing. Spend Time in Nature Nature is truly something bigger than ourselves, but it's also something we are a part of. Despite that, many of us, myself included, often forget how awe-inspiring and meaningful our world is. Sure, it may sound hippy-dippy at first, but almost anyone can learn to appreciate the spiritual side of nature. It can help us find purpose and meaning within something wider than our own human experience.
