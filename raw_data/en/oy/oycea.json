Exposures to environmental and occupational toxins happen daily. Heavy metals such as mercury, lead, cadmium, aluminum, pesticides, solvents, gases or fumes, and chemicals can all effect overall health and contribute to chronic, debilitating diseases. Chronic low energy, neurological complaints, immune system dysregulation, chronic inflammation, and autoimmune complaints can all be influenced by toxins. We offer specific programs based upon intake, exam, and testing to treat and detoxify the body. IV therapy, IV chelation therapy, oral chelation therapy, liver support, GI support, and cleanses are tailored to your medical condition. Big Sky Integrative Health supports healthy weight and life-long fitness goals by creating personalized strategies using cleansing, diet and nutrition guidance, and exercise. The importance of healthy weight continues to become more and more evident. Research in the past 3-5 years shows that fat tissue acts more like endocrine tissue than any other tissue in the body. It releases hormones (leptin, ghrelin, and adiponectin) that interact with cortisol and insulin\u2014two of the body's main hormones affecting metabolism, blood sugars, and fat deposition. Certain dietary and exercise parameters effect these fat-produced hormones to help achieve and maintain a healthy weight. "}
