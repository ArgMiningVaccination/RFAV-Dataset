A2.3 Glossary Introduction In this chapter: What Are Immunization Registries? Why We Need Immunization Registries The New York State Immunization Information System Introduction New York State Immunization Information System 1.1 The following sections are an overview of immunization registries reproduced with the permission of All Kids Count, a nonprofit organization dedicated to the improvement of immunization rates in children. What Are Immunization Registries? Immunization registries are confidential, computerized state- or community -based information systems. In the Healthy People 2010 program, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services set a goal of enrolling 95% of children from birth through age five i n a fully functioning immunization registry, noting \"Population- based immunization registries will be a cornerstone of the nation's immunization system by 2010.\" Registries enable public and private health care providers to consolidate and maintain comput erized immunization records on all children within a given geographic area. They enable multiple authorized health care professionals to access the consolidated information on the immunizations that any child has received. They help doctors remind parents when their children are due or overdue for immunizations. They help health care professionals stay abreast of the complex immunization schedule. Why We Need Immunization Registries The U.S. now enjoys the highest immunization rates and lowest disease lev els ever, but sustaining them is not easy. One of the greatest challenges is the growing complexity and volume of immunization information: Over 11,000 children are born each day, each needing 18 -22 shots by age six to protect them from debilitating, life- threatening diseases. An increasingly complex childhood immunization schedule makes it difficult for health professionals to keep up, even with the help of books, charts, and training. Families are more mobile than ever before. They relocate, change employers, change insurers, and change doctors with increasing frequency. Research shows that many parents whose children are not up to date with their immunizations mistakenly believe that they are. Many doctors also overestimate the coverage of their patients. Because of increasing concerns about vaccine safety, some parents, in the absence of disease, may not choose to immunize their children. Better data about the immunizations given can help address these concerns. Immunization registries help to avoid the \"peaks and valleys\" of disease outbreaks by providing accurate, up -to-date information about the immunizations that children receive. 1.2 New York State Immunization Information System Introduction The New York State Immunization Information System The New York State Immunization Information System (NYSIIS) is a population- based web application containing consolidated demographic and immunization history information. NYSIIS is able to perform a variety of functions for health care providers, including: Recording immunizations, contraindications, and reactions. Validating immunization history and providing immunization recommendations. Producing recall and reminder notices, vaccine usage and patient reports, and Comprehensive Clinic Assessment Software Application (CoCASA) extracts. Managing vaccine inventory. Immunization Information Systems in New York State are not new. The Citywide Immunization Registry (CIR) has been operational in New York City since 1997. Providers practicing in New York City are required to report to the CIR. Separate from the New Y ork City registry, the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) has operated regional software- based voluntary registries since 1997 that cover the areas outside of New York City. These regional registries have been collectively referred to as the New York State Immunization Information System (NYSIIS). Access to the statewide, web- based system will be available through the Health Provider Network (HPN) on the NYSDOH Health Commerce System. CIR and NYSIIS will operate independently as two different r egistries, but patient information may be shared across both registries based on the patient's address. Currently, NYSIIS is receiving weekly updates from the CIR for patients that reside outside the five boroughs but received shots in New York City. In 2006, New York State passed Article 21, Title 6, Section 2168 of the Public Health Law, which requires health care providers to report all immunizations administered to persons less than 19 years of age to NYSIIS beginning on January 1, 2008. NYSIIS cu rrently contains all New York State birth data (excluding New York City births) from January 1, 2004 to the present. Vital statistics are currently loading 500 new records daily. A significant percentage of new birth records (90%+) are in NYSIIS within t wo weeks of birth. When a provider begins participation in NYSIIS, they can manually enter immunization data directly into NYSIIS or utilize their existing electronic data systems to create a data exchange link with NYSIIS. System Requirements In this chapter: Internet Access Hardware Requirements Software Requirements System Requirements New York State Immunization Information System 2.1 Internet Access Since NYSIIS is a web -based application, you will need reliable internet access, preferably with a dedicated high speed connection, to access NYSIIS and the NYSDOH Health Commerce System.

Contact your information technology (IT) staff if you suspect your FTP access is blocked. Optimizing NYSIIS New York State Immunization Information System 4.3 Efficient Sc reen Navigation Microsoft\u00ae Windows\u00ae often allows users several ways to accomplish certain tasks. Because NYSIIS runs under Windows\u00ae, it also allows users to use these methods to enter data. Learning the shortcuts in this section will help you increase your efficiency when entering data in NYSIIS, particularly by reducing the number of times you will need to switch from keyboard to mouse. These shortcuts will work in almost all Microsoft\u00ae software, not just Internet Explorer. Keyboard Shortcuts in NYSIIS Shortcuts below that are marked with an asterisk (*) behave differently in Netscape\u00ae than they do in Internet Explorer. Read the explanation for the shortcut in question for more information. Deleting data: When a field or a portion of a field is highlighted, typing something deletes the highlighted information and replaces it with the characters you typed. If you hit the Delete or Backspace key, the highlighted information is deleted. To place the cursor in a specific position within highlighted text, posit ion the cursor where you want it and click the left mouse button once. Tab*: The Tab key advances the cursor to the next field. Internet Explorer moves through the fields in the order specified by the web page. When the cursor reaches the last field, it advances back to the first field on the screen when Tab is pressed. Shift+Ta b*: Holding down the Shift key and pressing the Tab key will bring the cursor back to the previous field. In Internet Explorer, the cursor will go back to the previous field defined by the web page. Enter*: In most cases, the Enter key will complete ent ry of information on the current screen. Most screens have a default button that is activated when the Enter key is pressed \u2014 this button could be called Save, Submit, OK, etc. (Left Arrow): The left arrow key moves the cursor one character to the left. (Right Arrow): The right arrow key moves the cursor one character to the right. Ctrl+ : Holding down the Ctrl key and pressing the left arrow key moves the cursor one word to the left. Ctrl+ : Holding down the Ctrl key and pressing the right arrow key moves the cursor one word to the right. Ctrl+A: Holding down the Ctrl key and pressing the A key will select all the text in the current field. Ctrl+C: Holding down the Ctrl key and pressing the C key will copy all highlighted text in the current fi eld to the clipboard without changing the highlighted field. Ctrl+V: Holding down the Ctrl key and pressing the V key will insert (\"paste\") the contents of the clipboard at the current cursor position. 4.4 New York Immunization Information System Optimizing N YSIIS Ctrl+X: Holding down the Ctrl key and pressing the X key will cut all highlighted text from the current field and place it on the clipboard. Delete: The Delete key deletes the character to the right of the cursor. If the field is highlighted, all highlighted text is deleted. Backspace: The Backspace key deletes the character to the left of the cursor. If the field is highlighted, all highlighted text is deleted. Home: The Home key positions the cursor to the left of the first character in the field. End: The End key positions the cursor to the right of the last character in the field. Shift: Using the Shift key in conjunction with any key affecting cursor position will highlight all characters in the field between the starting cursor position and the ending cursor position. For example, if the cursor is at the end of a field and Shift+Home is typed, the cursor is repositioned to the left of the beginning of the field and the entire field is highlighted. Ctrl: Using the Ctrl key in conjunction with any key affecting cursor position will move the cursor all the way to either end of the field, or the next space in the indicated direction. Using the Ctrl and Shift keys simultaneously not only moves the cursor, but also highlights all text in the field between the starting cursor position and the ending curso r position. Space: When the cursor is at a check box, the Space bar toggles the check mark on and off.

Manage Inventory New York State Immunization Information System 9. 37 Vaccine Loss Report PDF Report Example: Vaccine Loss Report Spreadsheet Report Example: Managing Patients In this chapter: Finding Patients Use of Dropdown Lists in NYSIIS Editing/Entering Patient Information Saving Patient Information Deduplication of Patients Patient Consent Managing Patient Status Countermeasure and Response Administration (CRA) Module Managing Patients New York State Immunization Information System 10. 1 Because NYSIIS receives immunization information from multiple provider sources, including birth record downloads, you should always attempt to find a patient in NYSIIS before entering them as a new patient . However, NYSIIS will attempt to deduplicate (compare entered information against information saved to the system for duplicate patient s) patient records prior to saving the information on the Enter New Patient screen. Finding Patients As mentioned above, i t is extremely important that you always search for a patient in NYSIIS before entering them as new . This will prevent duplicate patient records from being entered into the system. There are many different combinations of search crit eria that can be used to locate patients in NYSIIS. Remember, when searching for patients in NYSIIS, you are searching on a statewide level and not just within your organization. With this in mind, when searching for an existing patient in NYSIIS , more information is not always better. By entering too much information about a patient (mother's maiden name, phone number, birth date, etc.) you will increase your data entry time and decrease the odds of finding the patient due to typing and interpretation errors. To review recommended searc h criteria examples, please review the section \"Examples of NYSIIS Search Criteria\" later in this chapter. 1. Click on Manage Patient under the Patient s menu group on the menu panel. 2. In the Patient Search Criteria box, you have several options for finding your patient . Last Name: Entering the first three letters of the patient 's last name, along with the first two letters of the first name, will initiate a search of all patient s matching those letters. Entering fewer than three letters in the last name field will result in an exact name search; for example, entering the letters \"Li\" will produce only last names of \"Li.\" If the patient 's name is common, typing in the full name will narrow the searc h. First Name: Entering the first two letters of the patient 's first name, along with the first three letters of the last name, will initiate a search of all patient s matching those letters. If the patient 's name is common, typing in the full name will narrow the search. 10.2 New York State Immunization Information System Managing Patients Entering Names On all first and last names entered into NYSIIS for patient searches, NYSIIS disregards spaces, apostrophes, and hyphens entered. Middle Name: Entering the first two letters of the patient's first name, along with the first three letters of the last name, and the patient's Middle Name will initiate a search of all patients matching those letters. If the patient's name is common, typing in the middle name will narrow the search. Mother's Maiden Last: Enterin g the mother's maiden last name in combination with the data entered in the Last Name and First Name fields, will narrow a search for a patient with a common name. Alternately, you may find all patient s associated with a mother by entering only the mother's first name and maiden last name. Mother's First Name: Entering the mother's first name, in combination with the data entered in the above Last Name and First Name fields will narrow a search for a patient with a common last na me. Alternately, you may find all patient s associated with a mother by entering only the mother's maiden last and first names. Birth Date: Entering the patient 's birth date in conjunction with his or her first and last name will narrow a search for a com mon name. Gender: Indicating the gender of the patient will narrow a search for a common name, especially if the first name is androgynous. Phone: Entering the patient 's phone number only will identify patients with the exact phone number in NYSIIS. However, this method is not recommended, as a phone number may not be entered for a patient and phone numbers may change over time. Patient ID: Entering the Patient ID only will produce a single name match, if the patient ID is unique to the organization. To find a patient using this method, the Patient ID must have been entered previously in the patient record. 3. Press . 4. If multiple records are found matching the criteria you entered, a table listing up to 75 matches with detailed information on each patient will be shown below the Find Patient Information box. To choose a patient from this list, click on the patient 's last name, underlined in blue. Managing Patients New York State Immunization Information System 10. 3 5. If only one patient matches your search, NYSI IS will bring you directly to that patient's demographic screen in NYSIIS. 6. If no patient s match your search, review the search criteria information you entered for accuracy. If you suspect the patient has not been entered into NYSIIS, proceed to \"Entering A New Patient .\" 7. If multiple records are found matching the criteria you entered, and there are over 75 matches, NYSIIS will give a warning that there are too many patients matching your search criteria. Please refine your sea rch criteria to limit your patient list. Finding Patients with no First Name To search for a patient with no first name, you may: Search using only the last name with no other fields filled. Enter the full last name to return patients whose last name matches what is entered and who do not have a first name. Search using the last name and enter \"No First Name\" in the first name field. You may narrow the search of patients with no first name by entering other criteria, such as middle name, gender or birth date, etc. Manage Patient vs. Manage Immunizations Manage Patient and Manage Immunizations are the same query; in other words, they both utilize the patient search function. The difference is that the Manage Patient query will display the Demographic screen, while the Manage Immunizations query will display the patient's Immunization History screen. Examples of NYSIIS Search Criteria It is recommended that users utilize the \"3 -2\" search when attempting to find patients in NYSIIS. The 3-2 search includes the first three letters of the patient's last name, followed by the first two letters of the patient's first name. However, the following alternative search options can help refine or narrow search results: Patient Last Name and Date of Birth (DOB) Patient First Name and DOB Patient DOB and Gender Patient ID Patient DOB It is recommended that additional criteria are used when searching for patients with common names. This will help narrow the list of possible matches in NYSIIS. 10.4 New York State Immunization Information System Managing Patients Use of Dropdown Lists in NYSIIS When entering information on new patient s or editing patient information, you will use dropdown lists for many fields. NYSIIS uses dropdown lists \u2014 fields that contain a list of options from which you may choose \u2014 rather than free text fields for certain input data. The advantages of dropdown lists over free text fields include: Ease of use. Dropdown lists allow users to quickly fill in a d ata field without typing in the information. Health Level 7 (HL7) compliance . HL7 is a method of categorizing data so that it is uniform across all health reporting systems. This standardization allows providers using different systems to transfer data easily. With predefined dropdown lists NYSIIS stays in HL7 compliance. Uniformity of entered data. By choosing information from a dropdown list, users do not risk entering conflicting information that could decrease the accuracy of NYSIIS reports. For example, one user using a free text field might enter a county name using an abbreviation, while another user might spell out the entire name. Confidentiality. By using standard dropdown lists, NYSIIS avoids confidentiality issues associated with the typing of free text that could be construed as medical record information. Editing/Entering Patient Information The demographic screen allows you to update or change specific, non -immunization information relating to any patient in NYSIIS. The Enter New Patient screen, accessed by clicking this option on the menu panel, allows you to input information for a new patient into NYSIIS. The demographic and Enter New Patient screens are divided into the following sections: Personal Information, Patient Information, Address I nformation, Responsible Persons, Patient Comments, and Patient N otes. Note : Organizations participating in a pandemic exercise or event will utilize the CRA Event Information module located directly beneath the Patient Information section of the demographic screen. Managing Patients New York State Immunization Information System 10. 5 Personal Information Section The Personal Information Section at the top of the Demographic/ Enter New Patient screens contains patient -specif ic information used primarily to identify patient s when conducting patient searches.

If, after attempting to save a new patient, you receive a message box titled \" Patient Match Detected,\" NYSIIS has determined that the patient you are attempting to save already exists in the database. A table below the message box will contain one or more names of potential matches within NYSIIS. Click on each last name to display his or her information. NYSIIS will identify matching patient s even if the patient has had a name change; therefore, if you do receive a list of potential matches, click on the link(s) to determine whether one of the links matches your patient 's record. If after reviewing all the names given in the table you do not find a match for your patient , press the button. A confirmation box will appear; press . Be aware that if you do override the listed matches and end up creating a duplicate record for a patient, it will be difficult to manage the patient's immunization and personal information and the registry will lose its accuracy and efficiency. If you identify possible duplicate patient records, you should call the NYSIIS Help Desk immediately. Managing Patients New York State Immunization Information System 10. 17 Patient Consent Patient consent applies to patients who are 19 years of age or older. Patient Consent is written permission the patient gives to the State to allow the entry of their demographic information and immunization records into NYSIIS. The consent indicator displays on the Enter/Edit Patient screen for patients 19 years of age or older. It should be set to Yes if signed written consent from the patient has been obtained. It should be set to No if the patient has refused to give consent o r was once consented, but now wishes to revoke that consent. The consent indicator may be empty or non- specified if there has not yet been any opportunity to verify consent since the patient's 19th birthday. For a patient over 18 years old, setting consent indicator to No or leaving it empty has a significant impact on the patient's record. Users will not be able to edit any information or record or edit immunizations for the patient. However, the patient's data is available for viewing on- line and on all reports because at the time the data was recorded, it was consented or mandated into the registry by legislation. 10.18 New York State Immunization Information System Managing Patients Managing Patient Status From the Patients menu option, applicable user roles within provider organizations can retrieve a group of patients and perform bulk changes to the patient status using the manage patient status hyperlink.

Managing Immunizations In this chapter: Viewing Patient Immunization Information Entering Immunizations Editing Immunizations Countermeasure and Response Administration (CRA) Managing Immunizations New York State Immunization Information System 11. 1 NYSIIS allows you to view and manage historical immunization information and add new immunizations for a patient . It also recommends immunizations based on the ACIP tracking schedule. Immunization information for a specific patient may be accessed one of two ways: 1. Choose Manage Patient under the Patient s section of the menu panel. This will bring up the Find Patient screen. For information on finding patient s, refer to Chapter 10, Managing Patient s. Once a patient is retrieved, select the History Recommend button to display the patient' s Immunization History screen. OR 2. Choose Manage Immunizations under the Immunizations section of the menu panel. This will bring up the Find Patient screen. For information on finding p atient s, refer to Chapter 10, Managing Patients . Once a patient is retrieved, you will be immediately brought to the patient's Immunization History screen. Viewing Patient Immunization Information The Immunization History screen holds a large amount of information on each patient in NYSIIS. The screen has three sections: Patient Information, Immunization History, and Vaccines Recommended by Selected Tracking Schedule. Patient Information The Patient Information section at the top of the Immunization History screen displays information on the patient , such as name, DOB , Tracking Schedule, Address, Patient ID , and a scrollable list of C omments. Use this information to verify that the patient indicated is the patient for whom you were searching. To edit this information, press and refer to the Editing/Entering Patient Information section in Chapter 10, Managing Patient s. 11.2 New York State Immunization Information System Managing Immunizations Immunization History This table lists all the immunizations the patient has received to date that have been entered into NYSIIS. Immunizations are listed alphabetically by vaccine group and ordered by \"Date Administered.\" Vaccine Group: This is the vaccine group name. Date Administered: This date is the actual day the patient was given the vaccine. To view the tracking schedule information for the selected immunization, or an explanation of why an immunization is not valid or appropriate, click on this date. Series: This column denotes the sequence number within the immunization series. A vaccine may show as invalid because the patient was not old enough to receive it or not enough time has elapsed between doses . \"Partial Dose\" will display if the shot is flagged as a partial dosage. Vaccine [Trade Name] : This column displays the Vaccine Name, and the manufacturer's T rade Name of the vaccine is shown in square brackets . Dose: This column indicates whether full, half or multiple doses were administered to the patient . Owned?: If the value in the owned column is blank, the immunization data are owned by your organization. This would be a result of either manual data entry of this information or having sent it via data exchange. This is only an indication of the org anization subm itting the data; i t has nothing to do with the organization that administered the shot to the child. If the value in the owned column is \"no,\" the immunization data are not owned by your organization. This indicates that y our organization did not Managing Immunizations New York State Immunization Information System 11. 3 enter the shot information into NYSIIS. Click on \"no\" to find out who owns the shot information. Reaction: If this column indicates \"Yes\" and appears in red, this means a reaction to a vaccine was r ecorded. To view the patient 's reaction, click on the \"Yes\" link in the Reaction column or click on the notepad icon in the \"Edit\" column. Hist?: If this column indicates \"Yes,\" this record is historical, meaning the immunization was administered by a provider at another organization, not the organization that owns the data. If this column is blank, this indicates the immunization was administered by the o rganization that owns the data ( i.e. entered the data into NYSIIS ). Edit: When you click on the notepad icon in this column, you will be able to edit some fields for the recorded immunization using the Edit Immunization screen, as long as the immunization is owned by your organization or is historical. Note: Owned vs. Not Owned Immunizations A single provider does not own any of the patients within NYSIIS, but an organization does own the immunization data it enters into NYSIIS. If the \"Owned\" column on the immunization History table shows a \"No\" for one or more vaccines, this indicates that another organization entered the vaccine information and is attesting to the validity of the information. Any provider may edit a historical immunization, but \"new\" or non -historical shots may only be edited by the organization that administered the vaccine and entered the data in NYSIIS. Validation of Combination Vaccines NYSIIS validates each vaccine group component separately when recording combination vaccines. For example, if Comvax , which is a combination of Hib and Hep B was administered, and only one component is valid, that component will be treated as if it were a single vaccine and validated. The other component will be displayed as \"Not Valid\". The component that is not valid will not be counted in series. Between the History section and the Recommended Tracking Schedule section, the patient 's exact age is shown in a solid blue field. The age also displays on the printable version of this page. 11.4 New York State Immunization Information System Managing Immunizations Vaccines Recommended by Selected Tracking Schedule This table lists all vaccines recommended by the ACIP tracking schedule associated with the patient . Vaccine Groups are listed alphabetically. Select: Vaccines that are equal to or past their recommended date are automatically selected in the Vaccines Recommended section. You may also manually check other vaccines for inclusion in the Vaccines Recommended section. When the button is pressed the check marked selections will display on the next screen. Vaccine Group: This column lists the vaccine group name. To view the tracking schedul e information for the selected immunization, or an explanation of why an immunization is not valid or appropriate, click on the vaccine group name . Earliest Date: This date is the earliest date that the patient may receive the vaccine. Recommended Date: This date is the recommended date that the patient should receive the vaccine. Overdue Date: This date is the date at which the patient is pas t due for the immunization. This will also trigger the use of an accelerated schedule for future immunizations. Latest Date: This date is the latest date at which the patient may receive the vaccine. Managing Immunizations New York State Immunization Information System 11. 5 Immunization Color Coding The dates found in the Vaccines Recommended by Selected Tracking Schedule table can be shaded with color for emphasis. For a detailed listing of color definitions click on the online help icon on the Immunization History screen in NYSIIS. Some of the more common colors applied to the dates within the columns are defined as follows: Yellow: A date shaded yellow indicates that today's date is equal to or past the earliest date and before the recommended date for an immunization that has not yet been received. Green: A date shaded green indicates that today's date is equal to or past the reco mmended date and before the overdue date for an immunization that has not yet been received. Blue: A date shaded blue indicates that today's date is equal to or past the overdue date and before the latest date (if a maximum age exists) for an immunization that has not yet been received.

Duplicate Immunizations NYSIIS does not allow duplicate immunizations to be entered for a patient . If you attempt to enter an immunizat ion for a patient given within t wo days before or after an existing immunization with the same trade name, you will receive t he message, \"Warning! You are attempting to enter potential duplicate immunization records.\" NYSIIS will then allow you to edi t the entry(s) in question or override the system and save the duplicate immunization. If you receive a duplicate immunization override warning, follow these steps: 1. In the duplicate immunization override warning dialog box, review all immunizations to determine whether there are any duplicates. If the immunization(s) you entered need to be removed or edited, press \" Make Edits \". At the Record Immunization screen, make changes or remove immunizations as needed. Press OK . Managing Immunizations New York State Immunization Information System 11. 17 2. If an Immunization(s) listed in the warning dialog box is not a duplicate, select the checkbox(es) next to the immunization(s) to enter it as a separate vaccine event and press Save S elected. Note: The following scenarios explain how NYSIIS overrides duplicate immunization records: If there is a historical immunization on file and the same imm unization is entered from NYSIIS inventory, no warning message will appear; instead it processes the new imm unization and removes the historical imm unization. If there is a historical immunization on file and a matching imm unization is entered from Other Inventory, a warning message will appear. The user then has the choice to cancel the new immunization or save it anyway (adding a duplicate immunization). The user would need to explicitly delete the historical immunization to remove the duplicate records. Applying a Prerequisite Override to a Patient's Immunization A prerequisite override is a command within a tracking schedule that allows users to override a prerequisite vaccine once a patient reaches a certain age. A prerequisite override is not automatically applied to an individual patient 's immunization record. To apply a prerequisite override to an immunization, follow these steps: 1. Enter the immunization as described in the Entering Immunizations section of this chapter. You may notice that, as in the case of Td, the immunization will appear on the immunization history as one of a series, when in fact it is a booster immunization. The next two steps will correct this. 2. Follow Steps 1- 3 in the Editing Owned Immunization from Inventory section of this chapter. 11.18 New York State Immunization Information System Managing Immunizations 3. In the field marked Disregard Primary Series, choose yes. Note: this field will only appear open if the conditions (the chosen tracking schedule has an override on the vaccine and the age of the patient is greater than or equal to the override age) meet those of the prerequisite override. 4. Press Save. Editing Immunizations Editing Historical Immunizations To edit a historical immunization, use the following steps: 1. On the Immunization History table, select the historical vaccine record you wish to edit by clicking on the vaccine's notepad icon in the \"Edit\" column. 2.

In some cases, specific patient groups may be identified as being at higher risk than the general population and targeted to receive the vaccination first. These groups are called priority groups. The CRA Event Information section is used to collect Public Health data during a pandemic event or preparedness exercise (such as the response event to a Pandemic Influenza outbreak.) If your organization is selected for an event, then the CRA Event Inform ation section will be displayed on the Record Immunizations screen. Based on candidate screening, select the appropriate priority group category for each patient.

Only NYSIIS users with the role of \"MCO Data Exchange,\" or \"\"Admin User\" will be able to perform data exchange. HMO/MCO users will need to follow the steps in the \"HMO Data Exchange\" section of this chapter. Provider Organization Data Exchange Prior to establishing data exchange, the NYSIIS staff must be contacted to arrange for testing a Health Level 7 (HL7) file that your organization will be sending. Please note that the flat file format is currently only available for Health Plan Organizations . No new vendors or provider offices will be able to submit via flat file as of January 2014. NYSIIS prefers to work with the vendor or technical contact to test the file format first. Once that testing is complete, NYSIIS will run a test with each provider organization to ensure the provider organization itself is set up correctly in NYSIIS and is able to upload data into the system. Creating a test file for Data Exchange 1. Contact NYSIIS Help Desk (1-866-389-0371) to receive the most up to date version of the data exchange file specifications. 2. First step in testing is to submit a test message to the Message Conformance NYSIIS test application in the Health Commerce System. Sign into the Health Commerce system (HCS) using your secure User ID and password. Click on the 'My Content' tab Click on 'All Applications' Select HL7 topic (HL7 version, VXU QBP) Complete the necessary information regarding your office and EHR vendor Upload a test message - please remember to upload a single message only for this test A detailed report will be generated for your review. This report will include information on any errors that are found in the file. This information should be shared with your vendor. Once you have passed this test you may proceed to step 3. 3. Send NYSIIS staff a hypothetical sample file of at least 5-10 patient records. Include in this file a range of sample immunizations per \"patient\". NYSIIS will check the file and run it in test mode. All combination vaccines and single vaccines should ultimately be tested. 13.2 New York State Immunization Information System Data Exchange Provide at least 3 records where all patient information that you are allowing your clients to provide is entered (e.g., mother's maiden name responsible person, patient status, etc.). If you are only collecting the required and mandated fields, please let NYSIIS staff know that as well. Review code tables carefully, paying particular attention to spelling and to codes that are only valid during specific time periods or age groups. 4. Send screen shots of your data entry screen so a comparison can be made between how the data is being entered into your system and how it looks in the test data file. 5. Once the file format has been tested and found to be correct, request that each of your provider organizations contact the NYSIIS Help Desk (1-866-389-0371) to set up data exchange. The Help Desk will walk the data exchange representative from each office through the steps for data upload and explain the response files that are created. Please note if you have offices that wish to submit data as a group (in a parent/child format) then NYSIIS will need to be informed prior to the first submission so that the appropriate associations may be made within the NYSIIS system. i. An additional test file may also be requested when submitting in the parent/child format to ensure that patient information will be properly associated with the correct participating organization. Setting up your organization for Data Exchange In order to set up your organization for Data Exchange you must call the NYSIIS Help Desk and provide them with the following information: The name of your provider organization or Health Plan. The name of your vendor (EMR, Billing, Third Party) File format type : Indicate Health Level 7 (HL7) version Flat File or Health Plan query. Note: Files have a size limit of 150 MB combined of the patient, immunization and comment files that can be uploaded via the user interface. If files are larger than 150 MB, they will need to be split into smaller files for loading. Uploading a file for Data Exchange The NYSIIS Help Desk (1-866-389-0371) will assist you with your first data exchange. This file will be sent into NYSIIS in test mode. They will walk you through the data exchange process and explain the response file to you. Once your first file has been accepted in NYSIIS, it will be reviewed by your organization and the NYSIIS Help Desk. If both parties agree that the Data Exchange was successful, then your organization will continue sending data into the NYSIIS Application. Data Exchange New York State Immunization Information System 13.3 To perform a data exchange, follow these steps: 1. Click on Exchange Data under Data Exchange on the menu panel.

There are two main sections used in the Find Student screen. Enter Search Criteria for a Student Search Results Search Criteria Listed below are the main items used to search for a student in NYSIIS. Student Name Mother's Name Birth Date Gender Phone Number Student Name Search In order to locate a student in NYSIIS using his or her name, a certain portion of each of the student's Last Name and First Name must be entered into the respective information fields as described below. Last Name - At a minimum, the first three characters of the student's last name must be entered. A search can be executed using less than three characters for the Last Name. In this case, the system will search the database for a student whose Last Name exactly matc hes the search. 14.2 New York State Immunization Information System School /Camp User First Name - At a minimum, the first two characters of the student's first name must be entered. Middle Name - There is no minimum character entry for the middle name field. The middle name is only functional when used in conjunction with the student's last or first name or both. If the patient does not have a middle initial recorded in NYSIIS, using it in your search will not produce a match. Note : For quicker, more precise searches, entire Last Names and First Names should be used whenever available. The middle name will not function if used with any criteria other than first and last name. Mother's Name Search In order to locate a student in NY SIIS using his or her Mother's Maiden Name, a certain portion of each of the Mother's Maiden Last Name and Mother's First Name must be entered into the respective information fields as described below. The Mother's Name Search can be used independently or in conjunction with the Student Name Search. Mother's Maiden Last - At a minimum, the first three characters of the Mother's Maiden Last name must be entered.

Birth Date - Can be a valid date between 01/01/1880 and the current date and it must be entered in the following format MM/DD/YYYY. The search will return all students whose corresponding birth dates exactly match the date s entered. The Birth Date Search can be used independently, but is recommended that it only be used in conjunction with at least one other set of search criteria, such as Last Name. Typically there may be hundreds of students born on that particular day which will cause NYSIIS to hit the threshold limit. School/Camp User New York State Immunization Information System 14.3 Gender Search The Gender Search can only be used in helping to locate a student in NYSIIS when used in conjunction with one or more other set(s) of search criteria. Gender - Select one of the three options, Male, Female, or Unknown. Phone Number Search In order to locate a student in NYSIIS using his or her Phone Number, the criteria must be entered as described below. Phone Number - A valid seven- digit Phone Number must be entered. The search will only return students whose corresponding Phone Number exactly matches the Phone Number entered.

The Phone Number Search can be used independently or in conjunction with ot her search criteria. Once you have entered all your criteria for the search, click on the button to execute the search. Results are described below. Search Results Exact Student Match - An Exact Student Match means NYSIIS returned only one student. When this occurs, the Student Immunization History screen is displayed containing all of the relevant information regarding the student. An Exact Student Match will usually occur when the search criteria entered contains information inherently specific to a particular student. List of Possible Matches A List of Possible Matches means the search returned more than one and less than or equal to 75 possible student matches. All possible student matches returned are then displayed in a table. The student result table is sorted alphabetically by Last Name. Middle name, birth date and gender are also included in the table for each student. Using the information displayed for each of the students in the table, the student can be selected by clicking on the Last Name. The Student Immunization History screen i s then displayed containing all relevant information regarding the student selected. Threshold Limit When executing a search in the database, NYSIIS may find multiple possible matches from the search criteria entered. If the number of students exceeds 75 available matches, then no students will be listed for further selection. Instead, the following message will display: \"XX students were found. Please refine your search criteria to limit your student list.\" (Where XX is the total number of students found in the search.) This threshold limit occurs to restrict the extremely long lists of possible students. 14.4 New York State Immunization Information System School /Camp User In the event a threshold limit is encountered while executing a student search, the scope of the search must be narrowed. Revisit the search criterion that was previously used, and add additional information available for the student. Be sure to observe the search criteria restrictions listed above in the Student Search Criteria section. Student Immunization History Screen The Student Immunization History screen displays a student's immunization history and provides immunization recommendations based on the selected tracking schedule. From this screen, you are also able to select and add the student to a specific student list. This will allow you to run reports for that student. There are three main sections used in the Student Immunization History screen. Student Informat ion Student Immunization History Recommended Vaccinations School/Camp User New York State Immunization Information System 14.5 Student Information The Student Immunization History screen displays a student information header at the top of the page. This header includes student name, selected tracking schedule, as well as other student -distinct information. The information contained in the header (ex., name , date of birth and gend er) can be used to confirm that you have located the correct student , especially if you have made an exact match and were directed to the Student Immunization History screen following a student search. The Tracking Schedule drop down box is used to choose the tracking schedule that will evaluate the student's immunization history and recommendations. This selected schedule will be used when viewing or printing the student's information. Adding Students to Report List To add a student to a list , you must have first created specific student lists in the Manage Lists section of the application. Click on the drop down box and select your list from the available options. Then click the \" Add this student to a Report List \" hyper link. Once a student has been added to a list , the student cannot be added to the same list again until removed from that list. The student can however be added to more than one list. Student Immunization History The Student Immunization History table lists all vaccinations the selected student has received to date. Immunizations listed in the table are ordered alphabetically first, then by 'Date Administered'. The table columns are defined as follows: Vaccine Group : This co lumn lists the vaccine group name for each immunization received. Date Administered : This column gives the actual day the student was given the vaccine. Series: Validates vaccine administration per the ACIP schedule and denotes the sequence number within the immunization series. Vaccine [Trade Name] : This column displays the vaccine and trade name of the vaccination received. 14.6 New York State Immunization Information System School /Camp User Dose: This column indicates whether full, half or mult iple doses were administered to the student . Reaction: If this column indicates \"Yes\" and appears in red, it means a reaction to a vaccine was recorded. To view the student 's reaction, click on the \"Yes\" link in the Reaction column. Note : The student's age shows in a solid blue field between the student immunization history and before the recommendations. School/Camp User New York State Immunization Information System 14.7 Recommended Vaccinations The recommended vaccinations and corresponding dates for the selected student reside in a table titled 'Vaccines R ecommended By Selected Tracking Schedule'. The vaccine group list appearing in this table represents all vaccinations included in the tracking schedule as signed to this student. The table columns are defined as follows: Vaccine Group : This column gives the vaccine group name. Earliest Date : This column displays dates which note the earliest date the student could receive the corresponding i mmunization. Recommended Date: This column displays dates which note the date that the student is recommended to receive the corresponding immunization. Overdue Date: This column displays dates which note the date that the student is past due for the cor responding immunization. The dates found in the Vaccines Recommended by Selected Tracking Schedule table can be shaded with color for emphasis. The colors applied to the dates within the columns are defined as follows: Yellow will only be applied to those dates in the Earliest Date column. Yellow shading indicates that today's date is equal to or past the earliest date, and is before the recommended date. Therefore, the student could receive the immunization now. Green will only be applied to those dates in the Recommended Date column. Green shading indicates that today's date is equal to or past the recommended date, and is before the overdue date. Therefore the immunization is recommended to be administered now. Blue will only be applied to those dates in the Overdue Date column. Blue shading indicates that today's date is equal to or past the overdue date and before the latest date. Therefore the patient is overdue for the immunization and should receive it as soon as possible. Reflects whether a student has exceeded the maximum age to receive a specific vaccine. For instance, if a student has already reached the age of 5 and hasn't completed the Pneumococcal series, then the recommendation for Pneumococcal at the bottom of the student immunization history will show \"Maximum Age Exceeded\". Indicates the maximum number of doses that can be administered for the specified vaccine series. Indicates that an immunization series has been completed according to the A CIP schedule. 14.8 New York State Immunization Information System School /Camp User Information about printing an immunization record The Student Immunization History screen displays the information held in the NYSIIS database for the selected student.

Managing Blood Lead In this chapter: Background Important Information Risk Assessment and Lead Test Recommendations Viewing a Patient's Blood Lead History Viewing Blood Lead Tests Entering Blood Lead Tests Printing a Blood Lead Report Managing Blood Lead New York State Immunization Information System 15.1 Background As part of New York State (NYS)'s comprehensive public health approach to eliminate lead poisoning, the Department of Health (DOH) seeks to increase routine lead testing of children. NYS state law and regulations require health care providers to test all c hildren's blood lead levels at or around ages one year and again at or around two years, and to assess all children six months to six years of age for risk of lead exposure at least annually as part of routine care, with blood lead testing for children at risk of lead exposure based on those assessments. In 2009, amendments to Public Health Law and implementing regulations authorized: 1) physician office laboratories (POLs) to conduct blood lead testing using devices of complexity appropriate for their level of certification; and 2) the DOH to implement a data exchange between the New York State Immunization Information System (NYSIIS) and the statewide childhood blood lead registry, or LeadWeb. This data exchange will: Populat e NYSIIS with blood lead testing information stored within LeadWeb. Utilize NYSIIS as the primary mode for reporting blood lead test results from private POLs that use portable office -based lead testing devices. Requirements for the NYSIIS/LeadWeb linkage were div ided into four sections, including User Interface, Merges, Data Exchange, and Prompts and Reports. At the time of this module's release all four sections are operational , and enhancements continue to be made. A project involving electronic data exchange with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYCDOHMH) Lead Poisoning Prevention Program (LPPP)'s electronic immunization and lead registry (Online Registry) has been on hold since 2013. Until the project is completed, NYC POLs will cont inue to report using the OR and NYCDOHMH will fax or mail the paper reports for children residing outside of NYC to NYSDOH LPPP. Important Information The Blood Lead module in NYSIIS allows authorized users to view, manage, and add blood lead test results . All NYSIIS standard and administrative users will be able to view lead test results. Users can add blood lead test results only if their organization has Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certification by NYSDOH's Physician Office Laborat ory Evaluation Program (POLEP) , conducted the blood lead test in office, and been approv ed by the NYSDOH LPPP. Test results can also be printed using the Blood Lead Report. Physician Office Laboratories (POLs) that conduct blood lead testing on their pati ents are required to: 1. Be certified by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) through POLEP and have a valid CLIA certificate (CLIA number). 15. 2 New York State Immunization Information System Managing Blood Lead 2. Enroll for reporting blood lead test results by contacting the NYSDOH LPPP at (518) 402- 7600 or email lppp@health.ny.gov . Your office will be assigned a Lead Reporting ID number (LRI), and be issued a customized Blood Lead Test Report form (DOH - 4430). 3. Complete a NYSIIS -Lead training and receive access to the NYSIIS Enter Blood lead Data screen. The self -guided tutorials are approximately five minutes each.

Note: #15 to #18 will instruct you on how to generate blood lead reports Results for all non -NYC children must be reported within 14 business days of analysis. If the child is a NYC resident and the results are: o greater than or equal to 10 mcg/dL, the results must be reported within 24 hrs of analysis to NYCDOHMH LPPP. Reporting to NYSDOH will satisfy the reporting requirements. o less than 10 mcg/dL, the results must be reported to NYCDOHMH within five business days of analysis. Reporting to NYSDOH will satisfy the reporting requirements. Managing Blood Lead New York State Immunization Information System 15.3 Note: For point -of-care testing using waived test methods, such as the LeadCare IITM device, NYS DOH has established a confirmation threshold level of greater than or equal to 5 mcg/dL . Whenev er lead results generated by a waived device are greater than or equal to 5 mcg/dL : record results in NYSIIS with a comment that results of confirmatory testing are pending confirm test results with a venous sample analyzed by a clinical laboratory that holds a NYS permit in toxicology -blood lead. See practice standards for use of CLIA -waived point of care test devices at www.health.ny.gov/environmental/lead . (NYCRR Subpart 67- 1.2) Risk Assessment and Lead Test Recommendations This table displays New York State (NYS) Public Health Law and regulations requiring children to have a blood lead test at 12 and 24 months of age and to be assessed for risk of lead exposure at each well child visit. If found to be at risk, a blood lead l evel should be obtained. Columns for age of child, recommendation, date recommendation is due, if a risk assessment has been done, if a lead test is indicated, date of the test, and status of the recommendation are included on the table. This table will display regardless of age. The current recommendation row based on the child's age will be highlighted in green , unless an \"Action\" is needed (Repeat Test, Requires Venous Test to Confirm, or Requires Follow -up/Management) - then the current recommendation would be shaded gray with red text . Note: Prior elevated blood lead test results require confirmatory venous testing and an alternate follow -up schedule (review the PDF NYSDOH Guidelines for the Identification and Management of Lead Exposure in Children ). 15. 4 New York State Immunization Information System Managing Blood Lead Viewing a Patient's Blood Lead History The Blood Lead History screen is comprised of three sections: Patient Information, Risk Assessment and Lead Test Recommendation, Blood Lead Test History, and Blood Lead Data .
