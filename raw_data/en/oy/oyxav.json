One avenue in which nanome dicine can have a large impact is through immune modulation and \"nano -immunoengine ering\" . Nanoparticle size, design freedoms, and unique cell -particle interaction s can be taken advantage of to influence the immune system in new and efficacious ways. xvii This dissertation will demonstrate how cell membrane coating can be merged with nanoparticle design to facilitate immune modulation for the improvement of a variety of pathological c onditions. The rationale for cell membrane coating and the use of nanoparticles in immune modulation will be discusse d in the first chapter of the dissertation. The second portion of the dissertation will focus on the design of cancer cell membrane -coated nanopa rticles for anticancer vaccination. The nano vaccine is designed to includ e multi -antigenic cancer cell membrane s wrapped around an immune -stimulating nan oparticle core . The codeliver y of both comp onents to the lymphatic system then directs the formation of a strong and specific anticancer immunity . The third portion of the diss ertation will concentrat e on the development of erythrocyte membrane -coated nanoparticles for anti virulence vaccination. Membrane -disrupting pore-forming toxins naturally embed into the red blood cell membrane coating of the na noparticles. The nanoparticle -bound toxins are then safely deliver ed to immune cells for antigenic processing , driving the gene ration of potent anti-toxin antibodies and immunity . Finally, the fourth section of this dissertation will focus on the use of platelet membrane -coated \"nanospong es\" as a therapy for clearing mem brane coating on the nanoparticle accur ately mimic s the surface of a real platelet to enabl e the absorption of anti -platelet antibodies. The bound a ntibodies are then rendered harmless to real platelets and are cleared in a nanoparticle form , ultimately reduc ing autoimmune disease symptoms . xviii This dissertation will serve as an example of rational ly engineering cell membrane -coated nanop articles to enhance the ability of the immune system to resolve different immunological challenges. By harnessing these tools, cell membrane -coated nanoparticles can have a great impact in the field of immunotherapy, and have much potential to be expanded upon for new therapeutic and prophylactic modalities. 1 Chapter 1 Introduction 2 1.1 Introduction Our immune system is a complex network of cells, proteins, and physical barriers that work together to keep the human body free from disease. When mobilized correctly, it has the ability to seek out and eliminate forei gn invaders with exquisite specificity. Malfunctioning or underperforming immunity is often the root cause of many disease states. For example, an overactive immune system can result in autoimmunity, which is characterized by proinflammatory states and leads to the destruction of healthy tissue [1, 2]. On the other hand, an underactive immune system can lead to enhanced susceptibility to infection, which is becoming increasingly dangerous given the rise of antib iotic resistance [3]. With regards to tumorigenesis, it has been shown that the immune system is integral in helping to prevent the proliferation of malig nant cells [4]. It is now known that for tumors to successfully grow, cancerous cells must generally go through a prolonged evolutionary process in order to develop mechanisms for immune evasion [5]. Tumors can manipulate the surrounding microenvironment to support growth and suppress host immune responses using cytokine and growth factor se cretion [6], extracellular matrix restructuring [7], and cellular signaling [8, 9] . It is for this reason that an intense amount of research has been focused on leveraging the immune system to fight off cancer [10]. In general, cancer immunotherapies seek to train, augment, or supplement the body's own ability to eliminate malignant growths. There are numerous classes of immunotherapy, and they can act on 3 different stages of immunity, ranging from initial antigen presentation up to the final effector stages [11, 12] . Depending on the specific type of cancer being treated, early returns have thus far been promising, an d a number of immunotherapie s have proven to be highly potent in scenarios where the previous clinical standard of care had little effect [13-15]. Anticancer vaccination is a class of cancer immunotherapy that focu ses largely on training the immune system to recognize and m ount a response against tumors in an antigenspecific manner [12, 16] . Over the course of recent human history, vaccines have represented an attractive m eans of managing the spread of disease, as most are easy to administer and can promote the development of sterilizing immunity [17]. Particularly in the case infectious diseases, vaccination has proven to be highly effective, having likely helped to prevent millions of deaths as a result of largescale prophylaxis campaigns [18]. Despite the favorable history of antibacterial and antiviral vaccines, ant icancer vaccination unfortunately has not achieved the same level of success [19, 20] . Unlike with those against pathogens, there are additional hurdles that must be overcome in order for vaccines against tumors to be effective. One of the main challenges comes from the fact that most tumors are lowly immuno genic and originate from one's ow n healthy cells. As such, it is incredibly difficult for the immune system to correctly identify malignant tissue. Additionally, vaccines against established tumors must be administered therapeutically, requiring the need f or formulations that are highly p otent in addition to being tumorspecific. This has oftentimes necessitated the use of 4 complex strategies for immune system manipulation [19-21], many of which are lowly viable in a clinical setting given poor costtobenefit ratios. In 2010, the United States Food and Drug Administration approved the first and only therapeutic anticancer vaccine, sipuleucelT [22]. This autologou s cellbased therapy trains patientderived immune cells against a common prostate can cer antigen before reinfusion of the cells back into the patient. The treatment has been shown to marginally increase patient survival time, but the complex logistics and high cost of manufacturing a personalized cellbased vaccine have limited its commercial viability. To address the hurdles faced by traditional vaccination schemes against cancer, many researchers have turned toward nanotechnology to help guide the design of nanovaccines capable of producing poten t, specific, and durable antitumor responses [23, 24] . Compared with traditional vaccines, those manufactured at the nanoscale have unique physical and material properties that make them better suited for immune m anipulation. Through purposeful engineering, nanovaccines can be formulated with antigen and adjuvant payloads in a manner that maximizes immune responses through efficient d elivery to specific cellular subsets. Ultimately, the goal is to leverage such pla tforms for the controlled programing of endogenous immunity to reverse tumor burden. In this review, we start by covering some basic background information regarding anticanc er vaccines and the current state of traditional platforms. We then discuss develo pments in the field of anticancer nanovaccines, focusing on platforms for both nonspecific and 5 antigenspecific immune modulation. Finally, we introduce an emerging class of biomimetic nanoparticles based on cell membrane coating nanotechnology. This topd own strategy directly leverages nature's own design principles as a means of fabri cating multifunctional and multiantigenic nanosystems, which have the potential to play an i mportant role in the future of anticancer vaccination. 1.2 Background on Anticancer V accination 1.2.1 Cancer Immunology and Immunotherapy Cancer is generally characterized by an accumulation of mutations that allows for uncontrolled cell proliferation. As tumors grow, they are in a constant battle with the immune system and must evolve mechani sms for escape over time [5]. Due to the random nature of the mutations that lead to malignancy, phenotypes can vary greatly among different cancers, as well as among cells within the same tumor. This heterogeneity n ot only serves as a challenge for traditional cancer therapeutics, but also acts as an immune evasion mechanism, increasing the likelihood of some muta nt cell populations remaining undetected [20, 25] . Another immune escape mechanism occurs through antigen shedding [26]. As part of thei r normal growth, cells generate a large amount of wast e products, and these unwanted products are commonly secreted through membrane vesicles. When released in large abundance, this process can also deplete the parent cell of tumor 6 specific antigens, thus enabling the altered cancer cells to avoid destruction by cytotoxic T cells. Furthermore, shed antigens released into the bloodstream can act as decoys for neutralizing cancerspecific antibodies. Solid tumors can employ additional means of escape, whereby their local microenvironments are remodeled to promot e immune toleranc e [27]. A better understanding of how cancer interacts with the immune system has allowed for the develo pment of new and effective therapeutics. The goal of ca ncer immunotherapies is to leverage a patient's own immune system to eradicate tumors in a highly specific and relatively safe manner [28]. One example is through an overall activation of the immune system by administering proinflammatory cytokines, which are immunomodulatory molecules released by activated immune cells [29, 30] . Although the immune stimulation caused by these mole cules is nonspecific, an overall boost in immunity can some times strengthen immune cells enough to overcome tumor suppression. More specific, tumortargeted approaches can be achieved using genetically engineered chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) on T cells [31, 32] . In CAR T cell therapy, T lymphocytes are isolated from a patient or a donor through leukapheresis [33]. The cells are then genetically modified to express a receptor t hat can recognize tumorassociated antigens, leading to elimination of the co rresponding cells. Altered T cells are purified, expanded ex vivo, and finally infused back into patients for treatment. For some cancer types, this CAR approach has displayed str iking efficacy in the clinic. 7 Antibodies have also been widely used to elicit antitumor immunity. For example, tumortargeted monoclonal antibodies that recognize tumor antigens can trigger antibodydependent, by conjugating antibodies with chemotherapeutics, these cytotoxic c argos can be more accurately targeted to the tumor site and induce immunogenic cell death [35]. More recently, antibodybased checkpoint inhibitors have been used to directly modulate the function of specific immune cell subsets [36]. Immune checkpoints involve inhibitory r eceptors such as programed cell death protein 1 (PD1) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte -associated protein 4 (CTLA4) that regulate T cells. By presenting the corresponding ligands, the cytotoxic activity of T cells can be i nhibited by tumor cells and regulatory i mmune cells. In checkpoint blockade therapy, antibodies target and block these receptor binding sites, thus removing the inhibitory signals on the T lymphocytes and unleashing their full potential for eliminating can cer cells. Despite their ability to elic it strong antitumor responses, efficacy of checkpoint blockades can vary greatly by patient [37]. This discr epancy may be explained by the fact that the therapy generally relies on the presence of preexisting tumortargeted T cells [38]. For this reason, checkpoint blockades are being actively explored for use in combination with other therapies such as anticancer vaccination, which can help to generate new T cell populations [39, 40] . 8 1.2.2 Current State of Cancer Vaccines Canc er vaccines introduce tumorrelevant antigenic material in a manner that leads to downstream mobilization of the immune system [28]. As the most immunogenic mutations h ave likely already been selected out by the time cancer is detected [5], the presence of tu mor antigens alone is usually not sufficient to drive proper immune stimulation. As such, tumor antigens are almost always co mbined with an adjuvant in order to enhance the immune response [41]. In the basic process, delivered antigens are taken up by profes sional antigenpresenting cells (APCs), such as dendritic cells, which process and break down the antigens, followed by presentation of the peptide fragments via major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs) [42]. With the help of the adjuvant, the APCs mature, enabling engagement and activation of cancerrelevant T cells. Finally, the activated T cells can help to promote tumor elimination, either by further propa gating immune activation or by directly seeking out and destroying the cancer cells. Antigenic delivery to the immune system can be ach ieved in multiple ways. The most straightforward is the direct administration of tumor antigens. In single antigen approaches, a tumor antigen overexpressed on cancer cells is administered parenterally [43]. This has been shown to elicit a robust immune response against the target antig en, especially in combination with an adjuvant; however, this approach may ultimately be thwarted by tumor heterogeneity. Whole cell preparations are another source of antigenic material that can theoretically be used 9 to vaccinate against the full breadth of tumor antigens [44]. However, this strategy often suffers from inadequate antitumor immune responses due to the interference from irrelevant proteins. In response to the often weak immunity generated by the above approaches, dendritic cells can be pul sed with an antigen and stimulated ex vivo [21]. Once this process is completed, the cells are then injected back into the patient in a process similar to CAR T cell therapy. The manipulated dendritic cells can subsequently migrate to the body's immune centers, where they train endogenous T cells. In a final method, antigen ic uptake can happen in situ at the tumor site, taking advantage of processes such as immunogenic cell death, which provide autologous tumor antigens under an immunostimulatory context [45]. In situ vaccinations can also be achieved with oncolytic viruses that sel ectively infect and dest roy cancer cells [46]. In April of 2010, the United States Food and Drug Administration gave its first approval to a therapeutic anticancer vaccine, sipul eucelT, for the treatment of prostate cancer [47]. In this the rapy, patientderived dendritic cells are pulsed with prostatic acid phosphatase, which is expressed in a significant number of patients with prostate cancer [48]. After exposure to the antigen, along with granulocyte macrophage colonystimulating factor, the activated dendritic cells are introduced back into the patient. It was demonstrated in a clinical trial that sipuleucelT was able to extend median surv ival by 4.1 months, which pav ed the way for its eventual approval [47]. The successful tra nslation of this treatment has motivated the further clinical exploration of anticancer vaccine formulations, and a search on 10 ClinicalTrials.gov yields over 200 results for active trials. Examples of current clinical studies include dendritic cell therapie s for glioblastoma (NCT01808820), oncolytic viruses cancer (NCT00408590), peptide vaccines for recurrent glioblastoma (NCT02754362), and whole cell vaccines for breast cancer (NCT00317603). Although cancer vaccines have had some success in the clinic, their limited ability to produce strong antitumor responses has hindered their widespread adoption. Despite its regulatory approval, the longterm financial viability of sipuleucelT has come into question. The laborintensive processes involved in its manufacture necessitate its high cost, which may be hard to justify given that the treatment only modestly prolongs median survival. Singleantigen peptide vaccines are able to elicit potent immune responses against the tumor cells that display the relevant antigenic epitopes; however, due to the heterogeneity of cancers, antigen negative cells can eventually escape detection and proliferate without competition [20]. This approach is also not universal, and personalized identification and manufacture of vaccines based on tumorspecific neoan tigens may not yet be viable on a large scale [49, 50] . Whole cell vaccination with tumor lysates has the potential to elicit multiantigenic immunity, but the final immune response is often dampened by the presenc e of extraneous proteins [44]. This underscores the fact that, even when delivering the correct antigenic material, current vaccination strategies may not have sufficient immunostimulatory capacity to overcome the tolerogenic tumor microenvironment. 11 1.2.3 Adva ntages of Nanovaccines Nanotechnology offers many opportunities for improving the treatment efficacy of cancer vaccine formulations compared to traditional strategies ( Figure 1.1). A major advantage is the ability to formulate the antigen and adjuvant components together in a manner that maximizes immune stimulation [51]. Flexibility in nanoparticle synthesis methods and material choice allows for the incorporation of different classes of molec ules, such as proteins, polysaccharides, nucleic acids, lipids, proteins, and polymers. For example, electrostatic interactions can be used to bind nanoparticles and payloads with opposite charges together [52], or lipidbased cargoes can be incorporated into the bilayer through an insertion technique [53, also be encapsulated through chemical conjugation [55], or they can be decorated onto the nanoparticle surface [56]. Oftentimes, the nanocarriers thems elves can also be fabricated using biologically active vaccine components. For example, it has been demonstrated that both calcium phosphate [57], a mineralbased adjuvant, and certain antigen protein s [58] can be made into nanoparticulate form. Loading of antigen and adjuvant into nanoparticles can serve a variety of purposes. Encapsulation o f vaccine components has been shown to increase immunogen icity by protecting the integrity of the molecules from enzymes in the body, such as nucleases, proteases, and phosphatases [59]. Nanoparticulate delivery not only protects the adjuvant from degradation, but can also protect the 12 body from the systemic toxicity of the adju vants, which can cause side effects such as fever, lethargy , diarrhea, and nausea [60]. Nanoencapsulation can also be used to enhance immune responses by providing extended release properties. Certain gellike or polymeric nanoparticle platforms can act as depots, slowly releasing adjuvants and antigens over a long period of time [61]. Finally, there are a wide range of techniques available for loading both antigens and adjuvants into the same nanocarrier, which has been shown to dramatically increase antigenspecific immune responses by unifying the pharmacokinetics of the coencapsula ted payloads [51]. In terms of payload delivery, nanoparticles can be designed to better target immune cells and immunerich organs. At their size range, nanoparticulate vaccine formulations more easily dr ain into the lymphatic system after administration, enabling efficient delivery to the lymph nodes [62, 63] , which contain high densities of immune cells. The localization of the nanoparticles can be further improved by modifying their outer layer to display ligands specific to immu ne cell surface receptors [64, 65] . Nanoformulations can also be designed to promote intracellular localization in a manner that maximizes the biological activity of the payloads. For example, nucleotidebinding o ligomerization domain -like agonists and small interfering RNA (siRNA) can be delivered directly to the cytosol using nanoparticles designed to penetrate through cell membranes [66], and tolllike receptors (TLRs) can be engaged by various agonists when delivered into cells via an endosomal pathway [67]. Overall, careful choices in the use of materials, 13 loading methods, and synthesis techniques for nanoparticlebased formulations can all lead to improved vaccine efficacy. Figure 1.1: Advantages of nanoparticles for vaccine design. a) Various combinations of adjuvants and antigens can be form ulated using nanoparticle platforms such as liposomes, emulsions, nanogels, and many others. b) Nanovaccines can access the lymphatic drainage system for lymph node delivery while protecting cargoes from environmental deg radation. Once at the lymph nodes, the nanocarriers can deliver their cargoes to antigenpresenting cells (APCs) for immune processing. c) Nanovaccine properties can be tuned to efficiently deliver their cargoes for maximum immune activation. For example, nanoparticles can be modified to ta rget specific subsets of immune cells. They can also be delivered to specific intracellular compartments, where receptors for immune pathways can be triggered. 14 1.3 Nanoparticle -Based Can cer Vaccines 1.3.1 Nonspecific Modulation Some immunomodulatory nanoparticle platforms work to nonspecifically boost immune system function. While not strictly considered vaccines, these systems do rely on a patient's own tumor as the source of antigenic mater ial and work by augmenting immune proc esses such as antigen processing and antigen presentation. This is generally achieved by manipulating the immune system in a way that reduces immunosuppression or activates specific immune cell subsets to potentiate a response against cancer cells. In some cases, these formulations can also be combined with tumor cell killing mechanisms to increase exposure to tumorassociated antigens. 1.3.1.1 Enhancing Physical Proximity of Immune Cells An intuitive method for boosting anti tumor immune activity is to bring the principal immune cells responsible for tumor elimination closer to their target. To achieve this, nanoparticles can be decorated with two different antibodies, one to target and/or activate immune cells, and another to target the tumor cells. By using these bifunctional nanoparticles, nearby immune cells can be targeted to tumors, increasing the chance of exposure to released tumor antigens or apoptotic cancer 15 cells while enhancing immune stimulation. In a first example , biodegradable poly(lactic acid) nano particles were decorated with antibodies against the dendritic cell costimulatory marker CD40, as well as an antibody against human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)/neu, a common tumor antigen overexpressed in human breast cancer [68]. The antiCD40 antibody was found to both bind and activat e dendritic cells, inducing a strong pro inflammatory immune response that could be directed toward neu+ tumors. Intratumoral injection of the nanoparticles yielded 100% rejection, while systemic injections resulted in 70% of mice rejecting neu+ tumors. Imp ortantly, rechallenge of mice that rejec ted the primary tumor did not lead to any subsequent tumor growth. In another example, polystyrene nanoparticles were conjugated with antibodies against HER2/neu and calreticulin, a protein that facilitates phagocyto sis treated with these multivalent nanobioconjugate engagers were able to better take up HER2+ cancer cells and presented tumorassociated antigens via MHC surface complexes. Intratumoral and intravenous injections of the nanoparticles led to higher infiltration of CD8+ T cells and inhibited the growth of HER2expressing tumors. Upon rechallenge, treated mice rejected HER2+ cancer cells but not HER2 cells, demonstrating the specificity of the treatment and the durability of the response. I nstead of binding APCs to tumor cells, it has also been demonstrated that antigenspecific T cells can be linked to cancer cells in a similar manner [70]. Conjugation of nanoparticles with SIY -MHC complexes effectively enabled binding to 2C T cells, while the inclusion of antiCD19 allowed for crosslinking 16 with CD19+ Raji cancer cells. Sh ortly after intratumoral injection of the nanoparticles, mice were inf used with adoptively transferred 2C T cells, which led to significant retardation of tumor growth. 1.3.1.2 Reduction of Immunosuppression The immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment is a hurdl e for most anticancer immunotherapy treatments, as effector cells can be rendered ineffective by inhibitory proteins or antiinflammatory cytokines. For example, a melanoma specific peptide vaccine was found to be effective for early stage melanoma, but it failed to demonstrate efficacy at later disease stages due to increas ed levels of immunosuppressive cytokines like tumor growth factor (TGF) in the tumor microenvironment [71]. To address this, a lipos ome-protamine -hyaluronic acid nanoparticle was designed to deliver siRNA again st TGF into tumor cells [72]. Injection of the nanoparticles halved the levels of TGF in the tumor microenvironment while doubling the efficacy of the vaccine. This improvement was discovered to be caus ed by an increase in CD8+ T cells in the late stage tumor tissue along with a marked decrease in regulatory T cell levels. Other immunosuppressive efforts focus on the expression of signaling proteins on tumor tissue that interact with immune cells. Wellk nown pathways such as PD1 can be intercepted using checkpoint blockades, but systemic administration can have toxic side effects, potentially leading to the development of autoimmune diseases and pathological inflammation [73]. In one recent work, platel etderived 17 microparticles were used as a carrier for antibodies against pr ogramed deathligand 1 (PDL1) [74]. After tumor resection, residual cancer cells can oftentimes start to regrow the tumor or be released into circulation. These remaining cells can express PDL1 in response to inflammat ion, making it highly difficult for the immune system to destroy them an d prevent tumor recurrence. Due to the abundance of exposed collagen in wound sites, platelet microparticles were chosen as the delivery vehicle for antiPDL1 given their inherent targ eting ability. Intravenous injection of the microparticles immediately a fter incomplete tumor resections was shown to greatly reduce tumor regrowth and metastasis formation in both B16F10 melanoma and triplenegative 4T1 breast cancer mouse models. Simila rly, immunotherapy mediated by low dose doxorubicin has been shown to ha ve partial efficacy against BRaf protooncogene mutant melanoma, but it failed at longterm efficacy likely due to the emergence of the Wnt family member 5a (Wnt5a) protein on cancer cells. Wnt5a can induce dendritic cell tolerance and cause fibrosis of tumor tissue, as well as prevent T cell infiltration. A lipid -protamine -DNA nanoparticle loaded with plasmid DNA encoding for a Wnt5a trap was able to transiently reduce Wnt5a levels in the tumor microenvironment and significantly boost treatment efficacy u sing doxorubicin [75]. 1.3.1.3 Immune System Activation The immune system can be boosted through the introduction of immunostimulatory payloads, including pathogenassociated molecular patterns 18 (PAMPs), costimulatory mar kers, cytokines, and other signaling proteins. Adjuvant administration has been found to be a powerful nonspecific modulator to aid in cancer immunotherapy. PAMPs such as singlestranded DNA, doublestranded RNA, and lipopolysaccharides are recognized by the TLRs found on immune cells and help to promote downstream inflammatory responses. Many of these PAMPs, such as CpG oligonucleotides (ODNs) recognized by endosomal TLR9, have been extensively used as adjuvants in conjunction with a coinjection of proteins or peptides to promote specific immune responses [76-80]. Other TLRtargeted PAMPs such [83] have used in nanoparticle formulations as adjuvants, and some PAMPs have even been coloaded together to simultaneously engage multiple different TLRs [84]. Cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs), small nucleic acids characteristic of invading microbes, are a family of type I interferon (IFN) -producing PAMP s. These CDNs are in phase I clinical trials, but they require very high dosages to ensure that adequate amounts can get into the cytosol to interact with their stimulator of interferon genes (S TING) receptor. Encapsulation of CDNs into nanoparticles can improve cytosolic delivery and enhance immune responses at lower concentrations. In one work, cyclic diguanylate was encapsulated into polyethylene glycol functionalized lipid nanoparticles and u sed to adjuvant soluble ovalbumin (OVA) protein [85]. After vaccination, a significant increase in both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells was observed, and T cells restimulated with O VA produced fivefold increases 19 in IFN and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Further, a CDNadjuvanted B16F10 vaccine formulation induced a sevenfold higher frequency of gp100specific CD8+ T cells and significantly delayed B16F10 tumor growth. CDNs have a lso been incorporated into nanoparticles consisting of catio nic poly(amino ester) (PBAE), a polymer widely used for cytosolic delivery of DNA [86]. Delivery of cyclic diguanylate to THP1 cells using a PBAE carr ier yielded an equiva lent amount of IFN regulatory factor 3 activation as free CDN, but at a 100fold lower dose of adjuvant. When the nanoparticles were given as an intratumoral injection along with antiPD1 antibodies, complete remission of B16F10 tumor s was seen at an orde r of magnitude lower CDN dosage than the soluble form. The repetitive protein structure of viral capsids selfassembled into nanoparticles can also serve as a PAMP. For example, cowpea mosaic virus is a noninfectious selfas sembles into hollow, icosahedral which mice increased tumorinfiltrating neutrophils, activated neutrophils in the l ung microenvironment, and elevated levels of neutrophilsecreted cytokines. Significantly delayed tumor growth was seen after injections of the nanoparticles via various routes in multi ple different tumor models. In particular, the viruslike particles were able to eliminate primary B16F10 tumors in half of mice upon intratumoral injection, as well as provide longte rm antitumor immunity as shown by rejection of a contralateral B16F10 rechallenge. Other viruslike particles such 20 as the papaya mosaic virus [89], influenza virus [90], and tomato yellow leaf curl virus [91] have also shown strong adjuvanting propert ies that can be taken advantage of for immune modulation. Cytokines serve a very important role in the adaptive immune system and can also be used for potent immune activation. For instance, mast cells can influence dendritic cell migration to the lymph n odes and upregulate inflammatory responses through the release of granules full of immune mediators like TNF. To mimic this Figure 1.2: Viruslike nanoparticles for in situ anticancer vaccination. a) Schematic depicting the synthesis of empty cowpea mosaic virus (eCPMV) nanoparticles and their expected mechanism of action for tumor treatment. b,c) When used to treat tumor bearing mice, viruslike nanoparticles significantly enhanced sur vival in both a 4T1 luc metastatic breast cancer model (b) and an ID8Def29/VegfA ovarian cancer model (c). Reproduced with permission Copyright 2016, Springer Nature. 21 natural bo osting of the immune system, synthetic mast cell granules were synthesized by trapping TNF into a nanoparticle matrix of c hitosan -heparin [92]. Like real mast cell granules, the particles drained to lymph nodes and promoted germinal center formation. Due to the modular nature of the nanoparti cles, TNF could be replaced with interleukin12 (IL12) to promote polarization of immune cells toward proinflammatory phen otypes, such as IFN secreting T cells. Delivery of IL2, a crucial cytokine for T cell survival and proliferation, has also been explo red as a method to enhance T cell -mediated immunotherapy. Hydroxyethyl starch nanocapsules were coupled with IL2 using copperfree click chemistry, and incubation with T cells resulted in a high level of uptake and a fourfold increase in division index com pared to unmodified nanocapsules. It has been shown previously that nanoparticles delivering a combination of different classes of immuneactivating adjuvants can promote increased therapeutic efficacy [93]. Combinations of cytokines with other molecules, such as PAMPs [94] and costimulatory ligands [95], have also been shown to synerg istically activate immune cells. 1.3.1.4 Immune Activation and Immunosuppressive Intervention Combination Beyond combining different methods of activating immune cells, simultaneous use of immunosuppressive intervention and immune activation can also yield impres sive results. For example, combining IL10 siRNA and CpG ODN 22 into a pathogenmimicking nanoparticle resulted in a balanced Th1/Th2 cytokine response that improved antitumor efficacy [96]. Immune activating R848 has a lso been delivered to T cells by encapsulation in nanoparticles that were targeted to T cells expressing PD1 [97]. To enhance costimulation while reducing immunosuppression, dualtargeted nanoparticles have been dev eloped with both agonistic and antagonistic antibodies conjugated onto the same surface. In one case, anti41BB was attached onto particles to activate the 41BB costimulation pathway on CD8+ T cells, while the conjugation of antiPDL1 served to block PDL 1 expressed on the surface of cancer cells [98]. Alternatively, nanoparticles decorated with antiOX40 and antiPD1 were able to target T cells expressing both receptors, simultaneously activating them and preventing their anergy [99]. In both the cases above, T cells were less inhibited by the immunosuppressiv e tumor microenvironment, leading to enhanced antitumor efficacy in a variet y of mouse cancer models. 1.3.1.5 Combination with Traditional Anticancer Therapies In the examples discussed thus far, it can be understood that the immunostimulatory nanoparticle platforms relied on the natural immune processing of tumor cells as the source of antigenic material. To facilitate the generation of tumor antigens and downst ream immune activation, another strategy is to actively promote the release of material from tumors while concurrently introducing nonspecific immune modulators. For example, admi nistration of the 23 immunotherapeutic potato virus X alone caused a modest decr ease in the growth rate of B16F10 cancer cells, similar to monotherapy with doxorubicin. However, coadministration of both the components led to a significant improvement in antitumor efficacy [100]. In another wor k, cytotoxic cationic silica n anoparticles were used to induce necrotic cell death while delivering a STING agonist to the immune cells in the tumor microenvironment [101]. Finally, \"sticky\" nanoparticles were designed to capture antigens in situ before being phagocytosed by im mune cells [102]. After administration of antiPD1 antibodies, primary tumors we re irradiated and then injected with the antigencapturing nanoparticles. Taking advantage of the abscopal effect, proteinloaded nanoparticles could then travel to the lymph nodes to facilitat e an adaptive immune response, which led to the eventual destru ction of a secondary tumor in 20% of mice. 1.3.2 Specific Modulation The ultimate goal of vaccination is to stimulate the immune system while simultaneously guiding a specific response against the desired target. For cancer immunotherapy, this target is often a lowly immunogenic antigen that is differentially expressed by t umor cells. As a result, an ideal cancer vaccine requires delivery of the relevant antigens along with a potent immunological ad juvant, which can be used to force the immune system to mount an antitumor response. In recent research, nanotechnology has been employed to further improve the efficacy 24 of cancer vaccines using several strategies, including inherent nanoparticle adjuvancy , codelivery of antigen and adjuvant, targeted delivery to immune cells, enhanced immune cell uptake and crosspresentation, and cytosolic delivery. 1.3.2.1 Inherent Nanoparticle Adjuvancy There is a wide variety of materials and structures that can be made into nanoparticles, and one strategy for the formulation of nanovaccines is to carefully choose a material that is naturally immunost imulatory. This can help to streamline nanoparticle fabrication by reducing the complexity of the final formulation. As an examp le, nanoparticles made of viral capsids naturally activate the immune system, largely due to the conservation of repetitive prot ein structures or the retention of nucleic acidbased PAMPs. These viruslike particles can engage TLRs in immune cells while de livering an antigenic payload. Even very lowly immunogenic tumor - associated antigens like idiotypic immunoglobulin from B cell l ymphomas can elicit a strong humoral response when delivered by nanoparticles made of potato virus X coat proteins [103]. Other gellike nanoparticles can be made by crosslinking materials that mimic the structure of PAMPs, such as polymers [104], peptides antigens. dtetrapeptide hydrogels in pa rticular show promise as a vaccine adjuvant. Nanoformulations made by mixing irradiated tumor cells with a self assembling hydrogel made of the d configuration of naphthylacetic acidmodifi ed 25 GFFY peptide were able to significantl y protect mice from both E.G7 and 4T1 tumor challenges [108]. Immune responses to antigens can also be naturally boosted by carefully tuning their release over time. Nanogels are especially adept at this, as pro teinto polymer ratios can be precisely v aried to change matrix spacing and cargo release rates [109, 110] . Some formulations have shown impressive sustained protein release, such as a P BAE layerbylayer microparti cle that extended release hal flife from to 143.9 h [111], or a hyaluronic acidbased nanogel that released proteins for over one week in rats [112]. Antigen delivery can be further improved by modifying nanogels to be retained at the immunization site, promoting sustained release of the payload in the presence of immune cells [113]. Polymeric nanoparticles can also provide sustained protein r elease profiles, as in the case of a poly(lactic coglycolic acid) (PLGA)based formulation that was shown to release OVA protein for over a week [114]. When modified to carry gp100 or B16F10 lysate, the same particles could produce approximately threefold greater T cell activation compared to equivalent doses of protein in soluble form, and this resulted in superior B16F10 tumor suppression. 1.3.2.2 Codeliver y of Antigen and Adjuvant In general, delivery of antigens alone is not enough to trigger a strong immune response, requiring the use of an adjuvant to boost immune activatio n. For example, OVA antigen conjugated to poly(propylene sulfide) nanoparticles sh owed 26 no antiOVA immune response in mice, but high levels of dendritic cell maturation and OVAspecific T cell generation were observed when the same particles were delivered along with an administration of CpG, resulting in protection against influenza -OVA challenge [115]. Furthermore, vaccines generally work the best when the antigen and adjuvant are delivered concurrently to the same APC, which can be readily accomplished using nanoparticlebased systems. This idea was shown systematically with a model cancer vaccine consisting of a polymeric nanoparticle loaded with an OVA peptide and the TLR7/8 agonist R848 [116]. Administration of a payloads resulted in highe r antiOVA IgG production compared to either component in free form, one component in free form and the other encapsulated, or both the components encapsulated separately. In addition, codelivery of both the components together enhanced downstream T cell -mediated lysis of OVAexpressing cells and elicited increased local cytokine production. Many platforms have been designed for the codelivery of antigen and adjuvant together, including interbilayercrosslinked multilamellar vesicles loaded with OVA antige n inside and MPLA interspersed throughout their lipid bilayers [117]. Immunization with this for mulation led to an impressive 28% of CD8+ T cells exhibiting OVA specificity, which was 14 times greater than observed when using soluble OVA and MPLA. These specific T cells also retained their functionality, as shown by high IFN production upon restimul ation with OVA ex vivo . 27 When vaccinating against a heterogenous target like cancer cells, multiepitope vaccine formulations can be employed to prevent immune escape and tumor recurrence [20]. Modular vaccine designs, exemplifi ed by recent work describing designer nanodisks [118], can help overcome this barrier. Synthetic highdensity lipoprotein nanodisks were mixed with cholesterolmodified functionalized neoantigens for specificity. Mice immunized with nanodisks harboring a combination of three antigens experienced an expansion in their pool of antigenspecific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells when compared to those receiving soluble formulations. The multiantigen formulation also showed signifi cantly better control of B16F10 tumor growth compared to singleantigen or dualantigen formulations. Impressively, when mice were vaccinated in combination with anti PD1 and antiCTLA4, 90% were cured of their tumor burden. 1.3.2.3 Immune Cell Targeting Due to the easy surface functionalization properties of nanoparticles, the efficacy and efficiency of nanovaccines can be improved by including an immun e cell targeting moiety. Vaccine processing mainly takes place in APCs, and thus the most common immune cells t argeted are dendritic cells and macrophages. A variety of surface markers can be targeted, such as the Ctype lectin mannose receptor (CD206) by the inclusion the nanovaccine surface [71, 119, 120] . In one example, the targeting ability of mannose was examined, and it was observed 28 that functionalization could increase particle uptake into bone marrow -derived dendritic cells [121]. Strong localized signal of a flu orescently labeled targeted nanovaccine was seen in the draining lymph nodes at 24 h, while particles without mannose start ed to lose signal as early as 12 h after injection. Other surface markers such as CD11c [122], scavenger receptor class B commonly targeted. 1.3.2.4 Efficient Cytosolic Entry Traditional cancer vaccines suffer from difficulty i n entering the cytosol of immune cells. Cytosolic entry can help to facilitate the presentation of antigens by MHCI and subsequent mobilization of CD8+ effector T cells. In addition, there are several ma turation pathways and pathogen recognition receptors located in the cytosol that can be leveraged to boost the potency of vaccine formulations. As most nanoparticles are taken up endosomally, there exist many strategies for facilitating endosomal escape. D ue to the characteristic acidic environment of the e ndosomal compartment, redoxresponsive nanovaccines can be used to achieve this goal. For example, some polymeric nanoparticles can act as proton sponges and induce lysosome swelling and rupture when enco untering low pH environments [126]. Lysosomal rupture -triggered reactive oxygen species have also been shown to enhance proteasome activation, which can help to trigger MHCI antigen presentation [55]. In one case, the common transfection agent, polyethylenimine, 29 was coated onto the sur face of antigenloaded polymeric nanoparticles, and this helped to facilitate crosspresentation of the loaded antigen after uptake [127]. Similar reducible polymeric systems like and cationic dextran nanogels [129] have also shown a similar ability for facilitating MHCI restriction. Besides endosomal escape, there are other ways to enter the cytosol from the endosomal compartment. antigens are diverted into autophagosomes and the delayed antigen degradation allows for increased crosspresentation [130]. By taking advantage of this process, significant levels of OVAspecif ic T cells could b e induced, enabling mice to completely reject established B16OVA tumors in vivo . In another strategy, nanoparticles can be designed to directly cross cell membranes by incorporating cell penetrating peptides onto their surfaces [131-133]. Macropinocytosis of lipidcoated nanovaccines has also been reported [134]. Cytosolic localization gives delivered antigens access to MHCI presentation, but it can also be leveraged to enhance immune stimulation. Recent work has shown that retinoic acidinducible protein 1 ligands and STING ligands may be stronger activators of the immune system than traditional TLRbased adjuvants like CpG and MPLA [85, 135] . PC7A synthetic nanoparticles have been used to deliver antigen while simultaneously activating the STING pathway ( Figure 1.3 ) [136, 137]. When loaded with OVA, the nanoformulation induced a threefold incr ease in antigen crosspresentation due to endos omal disruption by the redoxresponsive 30 PC7A. Once in the cytosol, the PC7A also engaged the STING receptor, resulting in higher immune activation compared to poly(I:C) or other polymeric nanoparticle groups. The combination of potent STING activation and efficient antigen cross presentation led to significant antitumor efficacy against loaded antigens in B16 OVA, B16F10, MC38, and TC1 mouse tumor models. Instead of delivering antigens directly to the cytoso l, some recent work has also focused on delivery of antigenencoding RNA for in situ transcription and antigen production [120, 134, 138] . Aciddissolvable calcium phosphate nanoparticles carrying A) encoding the tumorassociated Figure 1.3: Synthetic nanoparticles activating the STING pathway for vaccina a) Schematic depicting an antigenloaded synthetic nano carrier (PC7A) and its proposed mechanism of action. b,c) When used to treat tumorbearing mice, antigenloaded PC7A nanoparticles significantly enhanced survival in both a B16F10 melanoma model (b) and an MC38 colon cancer model (c). Reproduced with perm ission. Copyright 2017, Springer Nature. 31 tyrosinaserelated protein 2 (TRP2) could elicit stronger antigenspecific T cell responses and humoral responses against B16F10 melanoma compared to peptide delivery [120]. In addition, PDL1 si RNA could be d elivered to directly downregulate PDL1 in dendritic cells to reduce immunosuppression. Cytosolic delivery of both the mRNAs was shown to have a potent antitumor effect, significantly better than cytosolic delivery of either component alone. T his strategy of RNA antigen sourcing has also been implemented using a highly modular RNA - lipoplex platform [134]. RNAcontaining lipoplexes were optimized to target the spleen by modifying the charge ratios of the components , and the resulting formulation was shown to be taken up into the cytoplasm of dendritic cells and macrophages via macropinocytosis. The TLR7 -dependent activation of APCs. Introducti on of antigenencoding RNA induced generation of functional antigen specific T cells and memory cells, which resulted in potent antitumor efficac y in several tumor models. Moving toward clinical translation, three human patients with advanced malignant mel anoma received five doses of the nanovaccine encoding for four tumor antigens. All three patients showed systemic IFN production, along with de novo priming and amplification of T cells against the vaccine antigens. 32 1.3.2.5 Artificial Antigen Presentation Most c ancer vaccines work by manipulating APCs, which can then further stimulate antigenspecific T cells and B cells. Recently, there has been signifi cant interest in developing artificial APCs (aAPCs) that are capable of directly stimulating effector cells [139]. This strategy was originally developed in order to effectively expand T cells ex vivo for adoptive c ell therapies such as CAR T cell therapy [140]. These aAPCs, which include both live cell -based and synthetic micro /nanoparticlebased platforms, mimic professional APCs and can strongly activate T cells while avoiding the intensive labor, high cost, and difficulty in quality control when using autolo gous APCs. Similar to their natural counterparts, aAPCs require at le ast two signals to induce T cell activation. The first signal, a peptide -MHC complex, binds to its cognate T cell receptor (TCR) and establishes antigen specificity. To become fully activ ated, T cells require a second signal in the form of costimulatory mo lecules such as CD80 and CD86, which engage their corresponding receptor on the T cell surface [139]. With these two signals, aAPCs have the poten tial to act as a vaccinelike platform that can expand antigenspecific T cell populations, but without the use of immunological adjuvants. In addition to the minimum two signal requirement, at times a third signal, in the form of solub le cytokines, can fu rther enhance the survivability of the activated T cells [141]. To generate nanoscale aAPCs capable of engaging and activating T cells, MHC -Ig along with a costimulatory signal, in the form of CD80 or anti CD28, has been decorated onto the surface of nanoparticles ( Figure 1.4 ) [142]. When 33 administered drainage compared with microscale aAPCs , which largely remained at the injection site. When administered into tumorbearing mice that received adoptively transferred antige nspecific T cells, the nanoparticles were able to help significantly control tumor growth. It has also been demonstrated t hat aAPCs can be fashioned using magnetic nanomaterials [143]. After incubation with their cognate T cells, these magnetic aAPCs helped to induce significant proliferation and c ould also guide the T cells to tumors with the use of a magnetic field. In the future, such a platform may be directly used in vivo to promote antitumor activity. Interestingly, it has been found that the shape of nanoscale aAPCs can have a significant imp act on their biological activity [144]. Ellipsoid nan oparticles were fabricated by stretching with a gp100 tumor antigen epitope. After intravenous injection, it was observed that the ellipsoid particles could induce more antigen specific T cells in circulation compared with their spherical counterparts. Although there are currently limited ex amples of nanoparticulate aAPCs being used in vivo , this nanovaccinelike platform holds significant potential given its ability to h elp bypass the complicated processes of antigen processing and presentation. 34 1.4 Cell Membrane -Coated Nanovaccines 1.4.1 Background As discussed thus far, nanoparticle technology has the potential to significantly alter the landscape of anticancer vaccination, e nabling the design of Figure 1.4: Quantum dot (QD) nanoparticles for artificial antigen presentation. a) Schematic depicting the artificial antigen presenting cell (aAPC) stru cture, where both the signals are attached to the nanoparticle surface using biotin -avidin interactions. b) When injected intravenously into B16 t umor -bearing mice that were also adoptively transferred with antigenspecific T cells, the aAPCs were able to significantly control tumor growth. Reproduced with permission. Copyright 2014, Elsevier Inc. 35 new nanovaccines with improved efficacy compared with traditional formulations. More recently, there has been a noticeable paradigm shift within the field of nanomedicine in which a greater emphasis has been placed on biomimetic desig n principles [145-148]. Along these lines, a new cell membrane coating approach has emerged in which nanoparticles are cloaked with a layer of cellderived membrane [149-151]. In contrast to traditional bottomup synthetic strategies, top down membrane coating dire ctly leverages naturally occurring biological mater ial for the fabrication of multifunctional nanoparticles. Using red blood cells (RBCs) as the source of membrane material, it was demonstrated that RBC membrane - coated nanoparticles gained the ability to a void immune clearance and circulated for extended p eriods of time ( Figure 1.5 ) [152]. The cellmimicking properties of these biomimetic nanopart from the transference of the originati ng cell's membrane proteins onto the surface of the nanoparticle substrate [153]. This approach for functionalization has proven to be highly generalizable, allowing for the delivery of a wide range of cargoes using different types of materials for the inner core [154, 155] . The outer membrane layer can also be modified with further functionality by facile means, affording additional flexibility to membranecoated platforms [54, 156] first work on RBC mem brane -coated nanoparticles was reported, research on cell membrane coatings has expanded in multiple directions. In addition to modulating the material composition of the inner core, the membrane can be sourced from a plethora of cell types, each resulting in unique formulations with 36 novel properties. For example, platelet membrane -coated nanoparticles exhibit the ability to target bacteria and damaged vasculature [157, 158] , while cancer cell membrane -coated nanoparticles can homotypically target cancer cells [159]. White blood cell membrane, with its various toxin and cytokine receptors, has utility for treating sepsis [160]. Other membranecoated formulat ions have also been reported using stem cell membrane [161], endothelial cell m embrane [162], and even hybrid membranes generated from mul tiple cell types [163]. As a result of all the complex functionalities that can be incorporated, this approach has enabled the resulting biomi metic nanoparticles to excel in nontraditional areas of nanomedicine. A major example is detoxification, where membranecoated particles can act as nanosponges to neutr alize toxins by taking advantage of their Figure 1.5: Functionalization of nanoparticles with a cell membrane coating. Schematic depicting the fabrication of red blood cell (RBC) membrane -coated nanopar ticles. RBC vesicles are obtained by hypotonic treatment, followed by coating onto polymeric nanoparticle c ores using extrusion. The resulting membranecoated nanoparticle exhibits a characteristic core -shell structure. Reproduced with permission. Copyrigh t 2011, National Academy of Sciences. 37 interactions with cell membranes [164-166]. By neutralizing these toxins and preventing them from attacking healthy cells, these nanoscale decoys have utility for the treatm ent of bacterial infections, animal envenoming, and even exposure to chemical warfare agents. The ability of cell membrane -coated nanoparticles to bind and present multiple antigens, combined with the flexibility of choosing various core mate rials, has als o made them suitable for vaccine design [23, 24] . 1.4.2 Cell Membrane -Coated Nanoparticles for Antibacterial Vaccination Overall, vaccines represent one of the most efficient methods of reducing the global health burde n posed by bacterial infections [167]. Toxoid vaccination represents an effective means of disarming bacteria of their virulent proteins, making it harder for the pathogens to colonize their host. This s trategy is currently used in the clinic to vaccinate against tetanus and diphtheria [168]. In order to make bacteria l toxins safe for administration, they are generally inacti vated with harsh chemical or heat treatments that can damage antigenicity and reduce vaccination efficacy. By contrast, RBC nanosponges have demonstrated the ability to naturally detain and neutral ize bacterial toxins when the two are mixed together, formi ng what are referred to as nanotoxoids [167, 169] . Using methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and its major virulence factor hemolysin as a model system, the corresponding nanotoxoid was able to ge nerate 38 significant antitoxin titers, improving overall antibacterial immunity compared to a heatde natured toxoid formulation [170]. While the control toxoid required 60 min of high heat exposure to achieve an acceptable safety profile, the nanotoxoid demonstrated excellent safety on a number of cell types at the outset. In animal models of both systemic and skin toxin burden, nanotoxoid vaccination on a prime with two boosts schedule resulted in almost complete protection. A later study also demonstrated the efficacy of this approach against live MRSA infection [171]. As the mechanism of toxin binding to membranecoated nanoparticles relies on function rather than the specific structure o f the toxin, the nanotoxoid platform can be easily generalized. To generate a multiantigenic nanoto xoid, RBC nanosponges were mixed with a crude hemolytic protein fraction isolated from MRSA culture ( Figure 1.6 ) [172]. It was confirmed that the nanotoxoids contained several toxins on their surface, including hemolysin, hemolysin, and Panton - Valentine leukocidin. Further, the nanotoxoids were found to be completely sa fe, whereas intense heat treatment of the hemolytic protein fraction could not completely abrogate its toxicity. When used as a vaccine, the multivalent nanotoxoids were capable of generating antibody titers against all of the aforementioned toxins, which helped to reduce bacterial burden upon live MRSA challenge. In addition to the nanotoxoid approach, another method of generating multiantigenic vaccines is to directly employ bacteriaderived membrane. Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are secreted from bacteria and are important in 39 pathogenesis as well as celltocell signaling [173]. Some vaccines employing OMVs as the an tigenic material have already been used in the clinic, as is the case with a formulation against meningococcal infection [174]. OMVs are attractive for use as anti bacterial vaccines because they often share a similar biochemical membrane pro file with their parent cell [175]. The utility of OMVs can be further improved by coating the material around a nanoparticulate core. In one instance, Escherichia coli OMVs were coated onto small gold nanoparticles, which Figure 1.6: Membranecoated nanoparticles for antibacterial vaccination. a) Schematic depicting the nanotoxoid concept, which can be used to develop vaccines against bacteriasecreted toxins. b) Vaccination using mult iantigenic nanotoxoids hemolytic secreted protein (hSP) from methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) significantly inhibited lesion formation caused by subcutaneous MRSA challenge, leading to decreased bacteria counts.

Due to the ability to finely control their size, the me mbranecoated particles efficiently localized to the lymph nodes, leading to strong and durabl e immune activation. 1.4.3 Cell Membrane -Coated Nanoparticles for Anticancer Vaccination As a whole, antibacterial vaccines have been extremely successful in reducing mortality rates related to infection. Unfortunately, the same level of clinical success has n ot been achieved for formulations against cancer. Recently, the extension of cell membrane -coated nanoparticles to anticancer vaccination has become an ac tive area of research. In one example, an RBC membrane -based nanocarrier was designed to deliver a hgp 100 tumor antigen peptide and the adjuvant MPLA [177]. The platform was further modified with mannose o n the surface to better target dendritic cells, and this led to enhanced localization to the draining lymph nodes. Both prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy were demonstrated in a B16F10 subcutaneous tumor model, resulting in a slowing of tumor growth an d a reduction in metastasis. Since cancer cell membranes contain a plethora of autologous tumor antige ns, utilizing the purified membrane of cancer cells as the antigenic material can be an effective approach in the design of nanoparticulate anticancer vac cines. This was 41 nanoparticles incorporat ed with MPLA [159]. The formulation significantly increas ed the maturation of bone marrow -derived dendritic cells and enhanced the stimulation of antigenspeci fic T cells. More recently, an indepth set of studies was conducted using a platform in which cancer cell membrane was coated around CpG ODN -loaded polym er cores ( agonist in was encapsulated into PLGA cores through a double emulsion process, and B16F10 membrane was co ated onto the adjuvantloaded cores by bath sonication. When the formulation was administered subcutan eously into mice, increased maturation of dendritic cells in the draining lymph nodes was observed, as indicated by the upregulation of protein markers su ch as CD40, CD80, CD86, and MHCII, when compared to various controls. Notably, CpG encapsulated in nanoparticulate form was able to activate the immune system significantly better than free CpG, likely d ue to the preferential cellular uptake of the nanopa rticles [179-182]. Additionally, it should be noted that TLR9 is located within the endosomal compartment, which highlights the power of leveraging the inherent properties of nanoparticles to purposefully manipulate imm une responses. Mice vaccinated with the nanovaccine were able to generate antigenspecific CD8+ T cells against gp100 and TRP2, both of which are melanomaassociated antigens [183]. When immunized mice were challenged with B16F10 cancer cells, 86% of the mice exhibited no tumor growth, even after 15 0 days. In a therapeutic setting, it was demonstrated that the nanoformulation, along with a cockt ail of antiPD1 42 and antiCTLA4 checkpoint inhibitors, was able to extend the survival of the tumor beari ng mice compared to either treatment alone. Building upon the concept of using cancer cell membrane -coated nanoparticles for antitumor vaccination, var ious strategies have been employed to augment immune responses. For example, mannose was introduced to be stow Figure 1.7: Membranecoated nanoparticles for anticancer vaccination. a) Schematic the of adjuvantloaded cancer cell membrane -coated nanoparticles (CpG -CCNPs) and their propos ed mechanism of action. b,c) When combined with a cocktail of checkpoi nt blockades (antiCTLA4 and antiPD1), treatment of established B16F10 melanoma with the CpG -CCNP nanovaccine resulted in significantly slowed tumor growth (b) and improved survival (c ).

As a result of this additional functionality, the targeted nanovaccine was able to offer better protection f or vaccinated mice. It was claimed that this triple combination of an adjuvant, cancer cell membrane antigens, and a targeting ligand could work togeth er to generate a robust anticancer immune response similar to levels generated against bacterial infecti ons. In another example, immune stimulation was enhanced via the concurrent delivery of multiple adjuvants in an artificial cancer cell membrane - coated nanoparticle [185]. CpGencapsulated calcium phosphate cores were fabricate d by a waterinoil microemulsion process and then coated with a membranemimicking liposome layer. Then, OVAexpressing B16F10 cancer cell membrane proteins were purified by dialyzing the membrane ag ainst a detergent solution. The membrane proteins, along with the dangerassociated molecular pattern Hsp70, were incorporated onto the nanoparticle surface to create the final formulation. This dualadjuvant formulation was able to significantly upregulat e maturation markers such as CD80, CD86, and MHCII, and treated mice had fewer lung metastasis compared to formulations with just the CpG adjuvant. In all, the works described in this section demonstrate that cell membrane -coated nanoparticles have signif icant potential to be used as nanovaccines. Armed with the versatility to easily modulate both the adjuvant and the cancer membrane material, which can eventual ly be derived from a patient's own tumor, this platform may ultimately pave the way for potent, personalized anticancer vaccine therapies. 44 1.5 Conclusion In this review, we have discussed the progress of using nanotechnology toward the design of cancer vaccines. In theory, vaccination represents an attractive option for cancer therapy, but in practice t here are many challenges that need to be overcome in order for such platforms to achieve widespread clinical adoption. Generally, it is highly difficult f or the immune system to generate a potent response against established tumors, which can employ variou s means to lower their immunogenicity over time. With the help of nanoscale delivery vehicles, researchers are exploring the design of novel vaccine formu lations that can elicit immune responses capable of overcoming tumor immunosuppression. Nanocarriers offer many advantages, including the effective localization of payloads to the desired immune cell populations, loading of multiple cargoes into a single nanoparticle, and prolonged release characteristics. More recently, a novel type of biomimetic platform , the cell membrane - coated nanoparticle, has emerged as a strong candidate to drive the further improvement of nanovaccine platforms. Membrane coating pre sents a facile means of introducing multiple functionalities onto the same nanoparticle without the ne ed for complicated synthetic techniques. Regarding anticancer vaccination, the use of cancer cell membrane as the coating material offers an approach for creating vaccine formulations rich in tumor antigens. Combined with a nanoparticulate core carrying po tent immune stimulators and the ability to easily target the resulting 45 nanoparticles to antigen presenting cells, cancer cell membrane -coated nanoparticle s can achieve strong inhibition of tumor growth. These nanoformulations may be further improved throug h the continued optimization of adjuvant and membrane antigen combinations. Methods can also be developed for obtaining membrane material from the resecte d tumors of patients, enabling the facile fabrication of personalized vaccines. Looking toward clinica l translation, a main challenge will be scaling up nanoparticle production in an efficient and costeffective manner. Nanoformulations will avoid many exp enses required for livecell vaccines, but there will likely need to be a substantial investment of ti me and resources to adapt current labscale manufacturing procedures to highthroughput workflows capable of production at the scale necessary for human p atients. These workflows will also need to align with good manufacturing practices to meet quality req uirements for regulatory approval. Finally, significant work will also need to be done on evaluating the synergy between vaccines and other types of cance r therapies. By simultaneously tackling the challenge of cancer treatment on multiple fronts, it may one day be possible to eliminate tumors altogether, regardless of their underlying characteristics.

Despite this fact, an effective anticancer vaccine that is widely applicable and facile to administer, while highly sought after, has continued to remain elusive [4, 5] . Fundamentally, the challenge lies in the need to generate potent and specific immune responses that enable the body to successfully distinguish between healthy and diseased tissue [6]. By the time a neoplastic growth reaches the malignant stage, the most immunogenic tumor specific antigens have generally been eli minated via negative selection [7, 8] . Some promising strategies under clinical investigation have focused on common tumor associated antigens, which are dysregulated wildtype proteins [9, 10]. However, the applicability of such singleantigen approaches is dependent on tumor phenotype, and they may also be subject to some of the same limitations facing targeted monotherapies as tumors evolve mechanisms of escape [11, 12] . On the other end of the spectrum, whole cell vaccine preparations a re capable of delivering a wide range of autologous antigens [13, 14] , but they have traditionally been ineffective. This may be a result of significant interference from a surplus of nontumorrelated antigenic material [15] or difficulties in direct administration, which have necessitated more complex cellbased strategies [14, 16, 17] . Additionally, the immunosuppressive microenvironment of established tumors is 67 often hard to break [18, 19] , leading to suboptimal efficacy despite effective training of the immune system. Advances in genomics have enabled the elucidation of individual canc er mutanomes, which can be leveraged to identify multiple vaccine epitopes on a personalized level [20, 21] . Other studies have demonstrated that high mutational burden can lead to neoantigen targets that are recognized by the immune system, and this correlates with cl inical response to checkpoint blockade therapies [22, 23] . While personalized epitope identificati on and vaccine manufacture may currently not be practical at largescale, these findings confirm that, despite the challenges facing whole cell formulations, there is a wealth of relevant antigens to be found in autologous tumor material. Applying the prin ciples of biomimetic nanotechnology [24-26], we explored the presentation of cancerderived membrane material in a context that could enable potent, multiantigenic immune responses for anticancer vaccine design (Figure 2.1). It was demonstrated that nanoparticulate delivery of the membrane, along with an immunostimulatory adjuvant, could facilitate enhanced antigen presentation, leading to the activation of tumorsp ecific cellular responses. Further, when used in conjunction with checkpoint blockade therapy to help break tumor immunosuppression [27-29], the nanovaccine formulation was able to achieve significant control of tumor growth in a therapeutic setting. 68 2.2 Experimental Methods 2.2.1 B16-F10 Murine Melanoma Cell Culture and Membrane Derivation B16F10 mouse melanoma cells (CRL6475; American Type Culture Collection) were cultured at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO 2 in T175 tissue culture flasks Figure 2.1: Schematic of CpGCCNPs for anticancer vaccination. Membrane derived from cancer cells (purple), along with the associated tumor antigens (small colored spheres), is coated onto adjuvantloaded nanoparticle cores (CpGNPs) to yield a nanoparticu late anticancer vaccine (CpGCCNPs). Upon delivery to antigen presenting cells (blue), the vaccine formulation enables activation of T cells (tan) with multiple specificities. After detecting the antigens present on the tumor, the T cells are capable of initiating cancer cell death (gray). 69 (Becton Dickinson) with Dulbecco's Modified Eagle (Gibco). 80 -90% confluency, 16 -18 million cells flask were collected in phosphate buffered saline (PBS; Mediatech) by scraping, pelleted at 700 \u00d7 g for 7 min in a Sorvall Legend Micro21R centrifuge, then resuspended in a 50:50 solution of cryopreservation medium (Hyclone) and complete DMEM. Cell aliquots were stor ed at 20 \u00b0C before use. To derive membrane, cells were first washed in a starting buffer containing 30 \u00d7 103 m TrisHCl pH 7.0 (Quality Biological) with 0.0759 m sucrose (SigmaAldrich) and 0.225 m Dmannitol (SigmaAldrich), then presence of phosphatase and protease inhibitor 10/35 probe homogenizer at 70% power for 15 passes. Membrane was separated from the resulting homogenate by differential centrifugation using a Beckman Coulter Homogenate was pelleted at 10 000 \u00d7 g for 25 min, and the supernatant was then pelleted at 150 000 \u00d7 g for 35 min. The resulting pellet of cell membrane was washed in 0.2 \u00d7 103 m ethylenediaminetetraa cetic acid (EDTA; USB Corporation) in DNase free/RNase free water (Invitrogen) and stored in the same solution at 20 \u00b0C until use. Total membrane protein content was quantified by a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). 70 2.2.2 Cancer Cell Membrane -Coated Nanoparticle Preparation and Characterization Polymeric cores were prepared process. PLGA was dissolved in dichloromethane at a concentration of 50 mg mL1. 500 \u00b5L of polymer was added to 100 \u00b5L of 200 \u00d7 103 m TrisHCl pH 8 and sonicated using a Fisher Scientific 150E Sonic Dismembrator at 70% power pulsed (2 s on/1 s off) for 1 min. An outer aqueous phase con sisting of 5 mL of 10 \u00d7 103 m TrisHCl pH 8 was added to the polymer solution and sonicated at the same setting for 2 min. The emulsion was then added to 10 mL of 10 \u00d7 103 m TrisHCl pH 8 and magnetically stirred at 700 \u00d7 g for 2.5 h. After stirring, the particles were pelleted at 21 100 \u00d7 g for 8 min, and washed twice in 10 \u00d7 103 m TrisHCl pH 8. Adjuvantloaded polymeric cores (CpGNPs) were made by including CpG oligodeoxynucleotide 1826 (CpG), synthesized using the sequence 5TCCATGACGTTCCTGACGTT3 with all phosphorothioate bonds (Integrated DNA Technologies), at 500 \u00d7 106 m to the inner phase of the double emulsion during nanoparticle synthesis. To optimize the loading, CpGNPs were made with CpG inputs of 250, 500, 1000, and 2000 pmol per 1 mg of PLGA. Each formulation was lyophilized overnight, then resuspended in 1 mL of acetone. PLGA was precipitated and pelleted with the addition of 1 mL water followed by centrifugation at 21 100 \u00d7 g for 20 min. CpG concentration of the supernatants were 71 measur ed using a QuantiT Oligreen ssDNA quantification kit (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. Further studies employed an initial input of 1000 pmol CpG per 1 mg of PLGA. B16F10 cancer cell membranecoated CpGNPs (CpGCCNPs) were made by pelleting the CpGNP cores and resuspending them in solution containing B16 F10 cell membrane. The mixture was sonicated in a 1.5 mL disposable sizing cuvette (Brandtech) using a Fisher Scientific FS30D bath sonicator at a frequency of 42 kHz and a power of 100 W for 2 min. The nanoparticles were washed twice in 10 \u00d7 103 m TrisHCl pH 8, and resuspended to a concentration of 25 mg polymer per 1 mL of solution in 5 \u00d7 103 m TrisHCl pH 7.5 and 0.2 \u00d7 103 m EDTA in DNase free/RNase free water for in vitro studies or in 10% sucrose with the same buffer concentrations for in vivo studies. If not used immediately, particles were stored at 20 \u00b0C. In the study, CpGCCNPs were fabricated with 100 \u00b5g of membrane protein per 1 mg of PLGA. Size and surface zeta potent ial of CCNPs were determined through DLS measurements using a Malvern ZEN 3600 Zetasizer. To test the stability of CCNPs in 10% sucrose solution, particles were stored at 4 \u00b0C for 2 weeks with size measured by DLS every other day. The morphology of CCNPs w as examined by transmission electron microscopy using a Zeiss Libra 120 PLUS EFTEM. Samples were resuspended in 10 \u00d7 103 m Tris HCl pH 8, deposited onto a glow discharged carboncoated 400 square mesh copper grid (Electron Microscopy Sciences), and negat ively stained with 1 wt% uranyl acetate (Electron Microscopy Sciences). 72 2.2.3 Membrane Antigen Retention Identification of characteristic B16F10 tumor antigens was completed via western blotting. B16F10 whole cells were collected from culture by scraping, lysed using 0.2% Triton X100 (SigmaAldrich) in lysed cells, B16F10 membrane, and CpGCCNPs were analyzed for protein content using a BCA assay, then each diluted to 0.2 mg mL1 in water. Each sample was then mixed with NuPAGE 4 \u00d7 lithium dodecyl sulfate sample loading buffer (Novex) and heated for 10 min at 70 \u00b0C. 25 \u00b5L of each sample was loaded into 12 well Bolt 4 -12% BisTris gels (Invitrogen) and run at 165 V for 45 min in 3( N morpholino)propanesulfonic acid ru nning buffer (Novex). Proteins were transferred to 0.45 \u00b5m nitrocellulose membrane (Pierce) in Bolt transfer buffer (Novex) at 10 V for 60 min. After blocking with 5% milk (Genesee Scientific) in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (National Scientific), blots were im MART1 Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The appropriate horseradish peroxidaseconjugated secondary (Biolegend) was used f or secondary staining. Membranes were developed with ECL western blotting substrate (Pierce) in an ImageWorks MiniMedical/90 Developer. 73 2.2.4 In Vitro Uptake and Activity All animal studies were designed and proceeded in compliance to the University of California, San Diego Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Female C57BL/6NHsd mice were obtained at 6 -10 weeks old from Envigo Harlan. BMDC culture was adapted from a previously published protocol [25]. Healthy mice were euthanized using carbon dioxide asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation. Both femurs were dissected, cleaned in 70% ethanol, and cut on both ends. Bone marrow was then flushed out of the bone wit h a 1 mL sterile syringe using warm BMDC basal media consisting of 500 mL Isocove's Modification of DMEM with 2 \u00d7 103 m LGlutamine m 4(2hydroxyethyl)1 acid (HEPES) (Mediatech) supplemented with 50 mL USDA certifi ed fetal bovine serum (Omega Scientific), 500 \u00b5L 55 \u00d7 103 m mercaptoethanol (Gibco), 5 mL 200 \u00d7 103 m LGlutamine (Gibco), and 5 mL penicillinstreptomycin. Cells were then pelleted at 700 \u00d7 g for 5 min, resuspended in BMDC growth media, consisting of the basal media further supplemented with 10 ng mL1 granulocyte/macrophagecolony stimulating factor (GMCSF; Biolegend), to a concentration of 1 \u00d7 106 cells mL1, and plated into petri plates at 2 \u00d7 106 cells per plate. On the third day of culture, 10 mL of BMDC growth media was added to each plate. To make CpGCCNPs with fluorescently labeled polymeric cores, 1,1 (DiD, = added to the PLGA so lution at 0.1 wt% of the polymer during nanoparticle synthesis. For the nanoparticle uptake study, BMDCs were collected on day 5 using 1 \u00d7 103 mEDTA in PBS. Cells were washed once in PBS, resuspended in BMDC basal media, and plated into 24well suspension plates. DiDlabeled CpGCCNPs were added at a final concentration of 1.4 mg mL1. At each timepoint (0, 15, 30 min, 1, 2, 6, 12, 24 h), media was removed, and the cells were detached with trypsinEDTA (Gibco). Cells were collected, washed once in trypsinEDTA, washed twice in PBS, and resuspended in 200 \u00b5L of 10% phosphate buffered fo rmalin (Fisher). The adjuvant uptake study was conducted similarly, instead employing CpGCCNPs synthesized with CpG containing a 5 6FAM modification (Integrated DNA Technologies). Free dye labeled CpG was used at an equivalent concentration for comparis on. For all experiments, after each time point was collected and processed, 1 drop of NucBlue Live ReadyProbe Reagent UV stain (Molecular Probes) was added and data were collected using a Becton Dickinson FacsCantoII flow cytometer. All data were analyzed using Flow Jo software. The activity of delivered CpG was examined using a BMDC cytokine release assay. BMDCs were plated on day 6 into 96well plates at a concentration of 8 \u00d7 104 cells mL1 in BMDC growth media. Dilutions of CpGCCNP or free CpG were add ed to the cells. After 2 h of incubation, the cells were washed three times with fresh BMDC growth media and cultured for another 2 d. Supernatant was then collected and measured for the presence of proinflammatory cytokines 75 using mouse IL6 and IL12p40 E LISA kits (Biolegend) according to manufacturer's instructions. Antigen and adjuvant colocalization by imaging BMDCs incubated ester (Biotium) and used to coat CpGCCNPs fabricated with FAMmodified CpG. BMDCs were seeded into 8well chamber slides at 7.5 \u00d7 104 cells mL1 and incubated with the nanoparticles for 15 min at 0.7 mg mL1. Cells were then washed three times with PBS, fixed with 10% formalin for 30 min, then washed again three times with PBS and mounted onto coverslips using VECTASHIELD mounting media with DAPI (Vector Laboratories). Samples were imaged on a Deltavision RT Deconvolution Microscope at 60 \u00d7 magnification. 2.2.5 In Vivo Cellular Localizat ion and Dendritic Cell Activation To assess in vivo localization, DiDlabeled CpGCCNPs were injected subcutaneously into each hock of female C57BL/6NHsd mice. After 24 h, the popliteal lymph nodes were collected into 500 \u00b5L of dissociation buffer consisting of 1 mg mL1 collagenase D from Clostridium histolyticum (Roche) and 1 mg mL1DNase I grade II, from bovine pancreas (Roche) in Dulbecco's PBS with calcium and magnesium (Gibco). Lymph nodes were dissociated manually by pipetting and then were s tained antibody isotypes (Biolegend) were used for gating purposes with cells from an untreated lymph node. After washing, dead cells were labeled with propidium iodide (Biolegend). Data were collected using a Becton flow cytometer and analyzed using FlowJo software. cell activation following immunization with CpGCCNPs, CpG NPs, CCNPs, or additional controls was determined by testing dendr itic cell maturation and lymph node cytokine secretion. To test vaccines with antigens and adjuvants delivered as separate components, additional controls of CCNP with free CpG and B16F10 whole lysate with free CpG were also administered. The CCNPs with f ree CpG formulation was made by mixing the two components such that the final ratio was 25 mg of PLGA per 3.5 nmol of CpG. Whole cell lysate was prepared by three freezethaw cycles at 80 \u00b0C for 10 min followed by 10 min at 37 \u00b0C. The amount of protein us ed for the formulation was normalized by the amount of Na+K+ATPase, a characteristic membrane protein, compared with CCNPs as determined by immunoblotting. To examine dendritic cell maturation in vivo , 50 \u00b5L of each formulation at 25 mg mL1 of nanopartic le, or equivalent, was injected into the hock. After 24 h, the popliteal lymph nodes of all treated mice were collected into 500 \u00b5L dissociation buffer and manually dissociated. Cells were stained were used for gating purposes with cells from an untreated lymph node. After 30 min of incubation at 4 \u00b0C, the cells were washed and stained with CellTrace Calcein Violet, AM (Molecular Probes) in PBS according to manufacturer's instructions. Data were collected using a Becton Dickinson FACSCantoII flow cytometer and analyzed using FlowJo software. To analyze cytokine production, lymph nodederived single cell suspensions were plated with 500 \u00b5L of BMDC growth media in 24well tissue culture plates. After 48 h, supernatant was collected and analyzed for cytokine content using IL6 an d IL12p40 ELISA kits according to the manufacturer's instructions. 2.2.6 Adoptive T Cell Proliferation and Native T Cell Generation B6.CgThy1a/Cy Tg(TcraTcrb)8Rest/J (pmel1) transgenic mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory at 4 -6 weeks old. The spleen, popliteal lymph node, and inguinal lymph nodes of one pmel1 mouse were collected for dissociation into single cell suspensions. The red blood cells in the spleen were removed using lysis buffer (Biolegend), and all remaining cells were pooled together. CD8+ T cells were separated out using CD8a (Ly2) microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) on Miltenyi Biotec MACS LS separation columns per manufacturer's instructions. After separation, cells were washed in PBS and stained with 78 carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE; eBiosciences). Cells were then diluted to 2.5 \u00d7 106 cells mL1 and 200 \u00b5L was transferred to na\u00efve C57BL/6NHsd recipients. 2 h postinjection, each mouse was injected with 50 \u00b5L of various vaccine formulations in both hocks. 4 d after treatment , the spleens were collected and dissociated into single cell suspensions. Adoptively transferred T cells were stained for using cytometer and analyzed using FlowJo software. CFSE dilution was used to assess the degree of T cell proliferation. To assess the native generation of antigenspecific T cells, C57BL/6NHsd mice were vaccinated subcutaneously with 50 \u00b5L of the different formulations in each hock on days 0, 2, and 4. On day 10, spleens were collected and processed into single cell suspensions using mechanical dissociation. After lysing the red blood cells, 5 \u00d7 106 splenocytes were plated into 6well suspension plates and pulsed with either 1 \u00b5g mL1 of mouse SVYDFFVWL (Anaspec) in BMDC growth media. After 7 d, cells were collected, washed in PBS, and stained with APCconjugated ow 79 2.2.7 In Vivo Immunity and Therapeutic Efficacy To study the protection conferred by vaccination, C57BL/6NHsd mice were vaccinated with 50 \u00b5L of the different formulations at 25 mg mL1 of PLGA, or equivalent, on days 0, 7, and 14. On day 20, the right flank of each mouse was shaved and, on day 21, mice were challenged with 2 \u00d7 105 B16F10 cells subcutaneously on the right flank. Tumors were measured every other day and the experimental endpoint was defined as either death or tumor size greater than 200 mm2. To study the antitumor therapeutic effect, C57BL/6NHsd mice were first challenged on the right flank with 5 \u00d7 104 B16F10 cells on day 0. On days 1, 2, 4, and 7, mice were vaccinated subcutaneousl y in the same flank with 200 \u00b5L of the nanoparticulate formulations. The subcutaneous route was chosen in this case to accommodate the larger dosage that was employed. The checkpoint blockade cocktail, consisting of 100 \u00b5g antiCTLA4 (9H10; BioXCell) was administered intraperitoneally on the same days. Tumors were measured every other day and the experimental endpoint was defined as either death or tumor size greater than 200 mm2. 80 2.3 Results and Discussion CpG oligodeoxynucleotide 1826 (CpG), a nucleic acidbased immunological adjuvant known to trigger the maturation of antigen presenting cells, was encapsulated into biodegradable poly(lactic coglycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticle cores via a double emulsion proc ess (Figure 2.2a). The amount of CpG that could be loaded started saturating at an initial input of 1 nmol per 1 mg of PLGA, and 100 pmol of the ad juvant could be loaded at this ratio. To introduce tumor antigen material, the membrane derived from B16F10 mouse melanoma cells was coated onto CpGloaded PLGA cores (CpGNPs). The process used for coating did not significantly alter the amount of adjuva nt within the polymeric cores. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements showed an increase in nanoparticle size after coating, and the zeta potential of the adjuvantloaded, cancer cell membranecoated nanoparticles (CpGCCNPs) increased to approximatel y that of pure membrane (Figure 2.2b,c). Successful coating was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), which revealed a characteristic core - shell structure (Figure 2.2d). Over time, the CpGCCNPs stayed stable in solution (Figure 2.2e). Impor tantly, the presence of known [30], including MART1, TRP2, and gp100, was confirmed by western blotting (Figure 2.2f). When normalized by total protein amount, significant antigen enrichment was observed on the derived membrane and CpG CCNPs when compared with whole cell lysate. 81 To study the interaction of the nanoformulation with antigen presenting cells, bone marrowderived dendritic cells (BMDCs) were employed. When incubated with dyelabeled CpGCCNPs, quick uptake was observed until saturation was achieved at 6 h ( Figure 2.3a). CpG is known to activate proinflammatory re sponses in antigen presenting cells [31], which is necessary for generati ng potent antitumor immunity. Using a fluorescently tagged CpG, the Figure 2.2: Preparation and charact erization of CpGCCNPs. a) CpG encapsulation into PLGA cores with increasing inputs, normalized by polymer weight (n = 3, mean \u00b1 SD). b) Size of CpGNPs, B16F10 membrane vesicles, and CpGCCNPs (n = 3; mean SD). c) Surface zeta potential of CpGNPs, B16 F10 membrane vesicles, and CpG CCNPs (n = 3; mean \u00b1 SD). d) TEM image of CpGCCNPs negatively stained with uranyl acetate.

To test the implications of this enhanced internalization and confirm the integrity of CpG af ter encapsulation, the biological activity of CpG in free form versus nanoparticulate form was assessed (Figure 2.3c,d). Secretion of two representative proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin6 (IL6) and IL12, was significantly enhanced for the CpGCCNP formulation, which was approximately an order of magnitude more immunostimulatory than free CpG. This effect is likely due to the fact that nanoparticulate CpG more readily localizes to the endosomal compartment during uptake, where it can engage its endos omal recognition site on tolllike receptor 9 (TLR9) [34]. It should be noted that CCNPs without adjuvant induced significantly less cytokine secretion when incubated with BMDCs at equivalent nanoparticle concentrations. While the CpG employed in the studies here was murinespecific, other variant s could easily be substituted to promote immunity in humans [35]. Further, the integrity of the nanoparticle structure was assessed by fluorescent imaging using dyelabeled CpG and membrane protein, and significant colocalization of the two signals confirmed the ability of the CpGCCNPs to co deliver both adjuvant and antigen to the same BMDC (Figure 2.3e). Upon in vivo administration subcutaneously via the hock, the nanoformulation could easily be detected at the draining lymph node after 1 h, with some appearing at an adjacent node after 24 h. Little signal was observed at the sple en given its considerable 83 distance from the injection site. Within the draining lymph node, antigen presenting cells such as dendritic cells and macrophages exhibited the highest percentage of nanoparticle uptake; B cells and granulocytes also displayed so me uptake, while the limited amount of signal observed for T cells was likely the result of nonspecific interactions with the nanoformulation (Figure 2.3f). Figure 2.3: Delivery of antigen and adjuvant to immune cells. a) Uptake kinetics of dyelabeled CpGCCNPs by BMDCs (n = 3; mean \u00b1 SD). b) Uptake kine tics of dye conjugated CpG in free form or within CpGCCNPs by BMDCs (n = 3; IL12p40 (d) by BMDCs when incubated with either free CpG or CpGCCNPs (n = 3; mean \u00b1 SD). e) Confocal microscopy colocalization of CpG and membrane proteins upon uptake of duallabeled CpGCCNPs by a BMDC.

Consistent with the fact that the dendritic cell maturation process is largely driven by the detection of pathogenassociated molecular patterns such as CpG, it was observed that both CpGCCNPs and CpG NPs without any antigen were equally potent. Without CpG, the antigenonly CCNP formulation exhibited significantly decreased activity. A similar pattern was seen when assessing the secreti on of IL6 and IL12 by the BMDCs. When administered in vivo , the CpGCCNP and CpGNP formulations were likewise able to induce significant dendritic cell maturation at the draining lymph node after 24 h (Figure 2.4a-d). They also outperformed additional c ontrols, including CCNPs with free CpG and whole cell lysate with free CpG, highlighting the advantage of nanoparticulate formulations. The level of cytokine secretion at the draining lymph node was shown to be mostly dependent on the presence of CpG, with all adjuvanted formulations performing similarly (Figure 2.4e,f). This effect was localized, as analysis of cytokine levels in the serum did not yield anything significantly above baseline . To confirm the utility of the CpGCCNP formulation for antitumor vaccination, its ability to elicit antigenspecific immune responses was verified using T cellbased assays. First, pmel1 CD8+ T cells, which specifically recognize a gp100 epitope, were adoptively transferred to recipient mice, which were subsequently v accinated with the various formulations ( Figure 2.5a). Treatment 85 with CpGCCNPs resulted in the highest degree of pmel1 T cell proliferation, indicating that the formulation was able to effectively deliver the gp100 antigen for presentation under an immunostimulatory context. Additionally, after a set of vaccinations in na\u00efve mice, the CpGCCNPs were able to promote the native Figure 2.4: Characterization of in vivo dendritic cell maturation.

T cells specific for both gp100 and TRP2 could be isolated and expanded from mice vaccinated with the CpGCCNPs. Further, when cultured ex vivo , immune cell preparations from mice vaccinated with the formulation showed significantly enhanced production of IFN and IL2 when stimulated with a gp100 peptide, a TRP2 peptide, or whole cell lysate, suggesting robust effectorlevel response against those targets. While these studies were generally limited to probing for immunity against well characterized epit opes, it could be reasonably inferred that the CpGCCNP formulation was concurrently generating additional responses against other tumorrelevant antigens. Figure 2.5: Characterization of in vivo T cell responses. a) Proliferation index of adoptively tr ansferred pmel1 CD8+ T cells after in vivo stimulation by CpGCCNPs or various control formulations, including whole cell lysate with free CpG (WC + fCpG), CCNPs with free CpG (CCNP + fCpG), CpGNPs, solution mean \u00b1 SD). b,c) Tetr amer staining analysis of T cells specific for gp100 (b) and TRP2 (c) after ex vivo restimulation of splenocytes from mice vaccinated with CpG CCNPs or various control formulations (n = 3; mean \u00b1 SD). *p < 0.05, **p < < 0.0001 (compared to CpG CCNP); oneway ANOVA. 87 To assess if the enhanced cellular immunity afforded by the CpGCCNP formulation could translate into functional rejection of tumor cells, a prophylactic study using the wildtype B16F10 model, which is poorly immunogenic [21, 36, 37], was carried out ( Figure 2.6a-c). In mice vaccinated with CpGCCNPs, there was significant activity, and tumor occurrence was prevented in 86% of mice 150 d after challenge with the tumor cells. Formulations consisting of either whole cell lysate with free CpG or CCNPs with free CpG both showed modest control of tumor growth, extending median survival from 20 d for the untreated group to 34 and 40 d, respectively. All but one of the m ice in these groups reached the experimental endpoint by day 48 after challenge. CCNPs without adjuvant had minimal protective benefit, with the mice in these groups achieving a median survival of 28 days. Finally, mice vaccinated with CpGNPs that had no antigenic material exhibited tumor growth kinetics identical to the blank control and displayed a median survival of 22 d. The results suggest that codelivery of both tumor antigen material and the CpG adjuvant together in the same vehicle is necessary for eliciting maximal antitumor immunity. The fact that CpGNPs alone had no effect is encouraging and demonstrates that the inclusion of cancer membrane material helped to provide appropriate cues for the specific detection and elimination of malignant cells by the immune system. The utility of the nanoparticulate vaccine formulation was further tested in a more clinically relevant therapeutic setting ( Figure 2.7a-c). In this study, mice 88 were challenged with B16F10 cells and subsequently treated with the nanoformulation. Using this design, CpGCCNPs alone displayed a modest ability to control tumor growth and extend survival. Given the aggressive nature of the B16F10 tum or model, the results were not unexpected, especially given that vaccination largely focuses on the training phase of adaptive immunity. Despite Figure 2.6: Prophylactic efficacy. a -c) Mice immunized with CpGCCNPs and various control formulations, including whole cell lysate with free CpG (WC + fCpG), CCNPs with free CpG (CCNP + fCpG), CCNPs, CpGNPs, and blank solution, on days 0, 7, and 14 were challenged with B16F10 cells on day 21. Average tumor sizes (a), survival (b), and individual tumor growth kinetics (c) were plotted over time ( n = 7; mean \u00b1 SEM). Reporting of average tumor sizes was halted after the first mouse died in each respective g roup. * p < 0.05, *** p < 0.001 (compared to CpGCCNP in survival plot); logrank test. 89 adequately enabling the immune system to recognize the appropriate targets, vaccine formulations for boosting c ellular immunity may not be particularly well suited for potentiating effector functionality in the presence of strong immunosuppression [38]. As such, the CpGCCNPs were combined with a checkpoint blockade cocktail consisting of antiCTLA4 and antiPD1, and treatment with the combination enabled significantly enhanced control of tumor growth. Median survival was extended from 18 d for the blank control to 32 d for the treated group, and 50% of tumors were still below the experimental endpoint Figure 2.7: Therapeutic efficacy. a -c) After challenge with B16F10 cells on day 0, mice were treated using CpGCCNPs combined with a checkpoint blockade cocktail of antiCTLA4 plus antiPD1 (CTLA4/PD1), CpGCCNPs alone, or the checkpoint blockade cocktail alone on days 1, 2, 4, and 7. Average tumor sizes (a), survival (b), and individual tumor growth kinetics (c) were plotted over tim e (n = 6; mean \u00b1 SEM). Reporting of average tumor sizes was halted after the first mouse died in each respective group. * p < 0.05, *** p < 0.001 (compared to CpGCCNP + CTLA4/PD1 in survival plot); logrank test. 90 threshold on day 48 postchallenge. In cont rast, the checkpoint blockades, which have not shown significant efficacy in a related B16 model [39], was about as effective as CpGCCNPs. The results confirm that the nanoparticulate vaccine formulation can act synergistically with other immunotherapies, modulating different aspects of immunity to promote the strongest antitumor responses. 2.4 Conclusion In conclusion, we have reported on a biomimetic nanoparticulate anti cancer vaccine formulation capable of activating multiantigenic immunity. The design leverages the unique advantages of recent nanoparticle technology, delivering both syngeneic cancer material along with a potent immunological adjuvant in a format that pr omotes effective antigen presentation. The final formulation is capable of generating strong antitumor responses in vivo and can work together with other immunotherapies such as checkpoint blockades to help control tumor growth. It is increasingly understood that presentation of tumor antigens alone, even in highly immunogenic contexts, may not be able to overcome the immun osuppressive tumor microenvironment [38, 40] . As such, efforts have shifted toward the rational design of combinatorial approaches that leverage multipl e modes of action [41- 43], including employing such strategies as adjuvant therapies to surgical resection [44]. In doing such, the potential adverse effects of immunomodulatory cocktails will also need to be considered [45]. The present nanoparticlebased cancer cell 91 membrane coating strategy represents a generalizable and effective means of boosting endogenous immunity against autologous material, which may, in the future, be derived from a patient's own resected primary tumor as a means to prevent relapse. All of this is accomplished in a manner that is unique when compared to current strategies and can possibly pave the way for enhanced personalized anticancer vaccines.

The issue continues to rise to the forefront as the development of new antibiotics has slowe d to a near halt [2], prompting physicians and scientists to explore alternative strategies to control bacterial infections [3]. Among the different approaches, antivirulence vaccination is a compelling strategy as it promotes host immunity by training the body to detect and disarm specific mechanisms employed by pathogens during host invasion [4]. This approach has been shown to inhibit the ability of pathogens to colonize within a host and is less suscept ible to the development of resistance as it does not exert direct selective pressure on individual bacterium [5]. Antivirulence vaccination is most commonly accomplished through the use of toxoids, or inactivated forms of live bacterial toxins, which include the commonly used tetanus toxoid [6] and diphtheria toxoid [7]. Conventionally, these toxoids are pr epared by denaturation via either chemical or heat treatment in order to eliminate the dangerous effects of the original toxin [8]. However, such inactivation methods are often disruptive and can lead to altered antigen presentation as well as compromised immunogenicity [9]. To overcome the trad eoff between safety and efficacy, emerging techniques 99 are being developed to produce vaccine candidates that faithfully present antigenic epitopes for immune processing [10]. Methici llinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an antibiotic resistant pathogen that represents a significant threat to public health, especially in hospital environments where many patients have weakened immune systems that are incapable of naturally fend ing off infection [11]. It can cause severe skin lesions and can ultimately be lifethreatening upon systemic invasion [12]. The pace of resistance exhibited by MRSA has severely limited treatment options, with many strains of the bacteria being unresponsive to all of the most commonly used antibiotics [13, 14] . This has led researchers to explore other forms of treatment, including the aforementioned antivirulence therapy. Known to secrete many different ty pes of exotoxins, MRSA represents a good target for such therapies. One of its major virulence factors is hemolysin (Hla) [15], a toxin that forms heptameric pores on cell surfaces, which contributes greatly to the pathogenesis of MRSA during the process of infection [16]. In fact, it has been shown that the virulence of the pathogen correlates strongly with the level of Hla production [17, 18]. Further, immunization with a mutant form of Hla has been shown to confer protection against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) pneumonia in mice [19]. Passive immunization with antiHla antibodies also protected against skin lesions caused by subsequent S. aureus infection, further attesting to the ut ility of such a strategy for combating the pathogen. 100 The application of novel nanomaterials toward vaccine design has the potential to bring about significant improvements via efficient and finely controlled immune manipulation [20-25]. We have previously demonstrated a nanopar ticle mediated toxin detainment strategy for the preparation of a safe and potent toxoid formulation. Biomimetic nanoparticles are fabricated with a cell membranederived coating that presents a natural substrate for poreforming toxins [26, 27] , leading to their stable entrapment onto the nanoparticles and enabling safe delivery in vivo for immune processing [28]. Owing to the nondisruptive approach of this detainment strategy, the platform was demonstrated to be superior to a traditionally formed toxoid by generating higher antiHla titers with i ncreased avidity. Further, vaccination with the detained toxin conferred a significant survival benefit in a murine model of lethal toxin challenge. In the present work, we investigated the protective capabilities of nanoparticledetained staphylococcal Hl a, denoted nanotoxoid(Hla), against live bacterial challenge using a mouse model of MRSA skin infection ( Figure 3.1.1 ). The immune potentiating ct of the nanoparticle formulation was studied more indepth by looking at the formation of germinal centers in the draining lymph nodes (dLNs) of vaccinated mice, which was then correlated to antiHla titer production. The ability of the nanotoxoid(Hla) v accine to protect against MRSA infection and lessen bacterial colonization was evaluated in a mouse model of skin lesion formation. Beyond local infection, the effect of the nanoparticle vaccination on bacterial invasiveness was further studied by enumerat ing the bacterial load in major organs. 101 3.1.2 Experimental Methods 3.1.2.1 Preparation and Characterization of Nanotoxoid(Hla) RBC membranecoated nanoparticles were prepared as previously described [26]. Polymeric cores modified nanoprecipitation method. The polymer was dissolved in acetone at a concentration of 10 mg mL1 and added rapidly to 2 mL of deionized water. The mixture was placed under vacuum fo r 3 h to evaporate the organic solvent. To obtain the membrane material, Figure 3.1.1: Schematic of nanotoxoid(Hla) protection against MRSA infection. a) Under normal conditions, MRSA bacteria employ Hla to help them colonize the site of challenge, resulting in significant skin lesion formation and systemic invasiveness. b) After vaccination with the nanotoxoid(Hla) formulation, antiHla titers are induced. These antibodies neutralize the toxin produced by the MRSA bacteria at the site of challenge, reducing the ability of the pa thogen to colonize and enter into systemic circulation. 102 RBCs collected from 6 week old male CD1 mice (Harlan Laboratories) were treated with hypotonic medium and washed multiple times by centrifugation. The final RBC membranecoated nanop articles, denoted nanotoxoid(), were synthesized by sonicating a mixture of the PLGA cores and RBC membrane using a Fisher Scientific FS30D bath sonicator at a frequency of 42 kHz and a power of 100 W for 2 min. The membrane material from 1 mL of mouse bl ood was used to coat 5 mg of 100 nm PLGA cores. The nanotoxoid(Hla) was generated by incubating 0.2 mg of nanotoxoid() with 3 g of Hla at 37 \u00b0C for 15 min. Nanoparticle concentrations for both the nanotoxoid(Hla) and nanotoxoid() formulations were expre ssed as milligrams of PLGA per 1 mL of solution (mg mL1). The mixture was then filtered through a Sepharose CL4B (SigmaAldrich) column to obtain purified nanotoxoid(Hla) free of unbound toxin. The size and the zeta potential of the different nanoformula tions were measured by dynamic light scattering using a Malvern ZEN 3600 Zetasizer. The structure of the nanotoxoid(Hla) was examined using a Zeiss Libra 120 PLUS EFTEM Transmission Electron Microscope. Samples were negatively stained with 0.1 wt% uranyl acetate prior to visualization. 3.1.2.2 Nanotoxoid(Hla) Loading Analysis An immunogold staining assay was carried out to confirm insertion of Hla onto the RBC membranecoated nanoparticles. One drop of nanotoxoid(Hla) or nanotoxoid() solution was added onto a glowdischarged carboncoated 400mesh 103 copper grid (Electron Microscopy Sciences). The grids were then washed before subjecting to blocking with 1 wt% bovine serum albumin (BSA), primary immunostaining with polyclonal secondary staining with goldlabeled antirabbit IgG antibody (SigmaAldrich). Images were obtained using a Zeiss Libra 120 PLUS EFTEM Transmission Electron Microscope without negative staining. To analyze Hla retention by dot blot analysis , 1 L of nanotoxoid(Hla) solution at 2 mg mL1 was dropped onto a nitrocellulose membrane and allowed to fully dry under vacuum. Afterward, the membrane was blocked with 1 wt% BSA solution and then probed with a polyclonal rabbit antiHla primary antibody IgGhorseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate secondary antibody (Biolegend). The blot was developed with ECL western blotting substrate (Pierce) using a MiniMedical/90 Developer (ImageWorks). Nanotoxoid() so lution at 2 mg mL1 was used as negative control and Hla solution corresponding to 100% loading (30 g mL1) was used as positive control. Blot intensity was measured by analyzing the mean gray values of dots via Image J software. 3.1.2.3 Germinal Center Analysis All animal experiments followed protocols that were reviewed, approved, and performed under the regulatory supervision of the University of California, San Diego's institutional biosafety program and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Sixweek old male CD1 mice (Harlan Laboratories) were immunized 104 subcutaneously in the lateral tarsal region just above the ankle with 0.1 mg of nanotoxoid(Hla). Nanotoxoid() and PBS were used as negative controls. On day 21 postimmunization, the mice were euthanized and the draining popliteal lymph nodes were collected for analysis. For immunohistochemical analysis, the lymph nodes were cryosectioned and stained with antimouse/antihuman B220Pacific Blue, antimouse IgDAlexa and Fluor 647 antibodies (Biolegend). For flow cytometry analysis, Lymph nodes were digested in 1 mg mL1collagenase D (Roche) solution and stained with the above antibodies. Data were collected using a BD FACSCantoII flow cytometer a nd analyzed using Flow Jo software. 3.1.2.4 Anti -Hla Titer Analysis Mice were subcutaneously administered with 0.1 mg of nanotoxoid(Hla), 0.1 mg of nanotoxoid() or PBS, followed by a boost 14 days later ( n = 6). On days 0, 14, and 35, the serum of each mouse was collected to assay for Hlaspecific antibody titers by an enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A 96well plate was coated overnight with 2 g ml1 Hla using commercial coating buffer (Biolegen d). The wells were then blocked with 5 wt% milk before adding serially diluted serum samples as the primary antibody. Goat antimouse IgGHRP (Biolegend) was then employed as the secondary antibody. The plate was developed with 1Step Slow TMBELISA substra te (Pierce) and measured at 450 nm with a Tecan Infinite M200 Multiplate Reader. 105 3.1.2.5 Infection and Vaccine Efficacy The MRSA strain USA300 TCH1516 (American Type Culture Collection) was used in this study. The bacteria were cultured at 37 \u00b0C in t ryptic soy broth, harvested by centrifugation, washed, suspended with PBS, and adjusted to the appropriate concentration by optical density measurements before use. Mice immunized with 0.1 mg of nanotoxoid(Hla), 0.1 mg of nanotoxoid(), or PBS on days 0 an d 14 were challenged with 1 \u00d7 109 CFU of the bacteria on day 35. The bacteria were inoculated subcutaneously in the back region in an area that was carefully shaved using hair clippers before the challenge. The dermonecrotic area was monitored daily and reported as the width multiplied by the length of the visible lesion. On day 6 postchallenge the mice were euthanized; perfused with PBS via the heart; and the skin, heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney of each mouse were excised and processed for enumeration. Briefly, organs were homogen ized in sterile PBS using a Biospec Mini BeadBeater, diluted tenfold serially with PBS, plated onto tryptic soy agar, and finally the colonies were counted after 24 h of incubation at 37 \u00b0C. 3.1.3 Results and Discussion Nanoparticles coated with red blood cell (RBC) membrane were prepared using a previously described protocol [29]. Briefly, mouse RBCs were subjected to 106 hypotonic treatment to obtain purified RBC membrane ghosts, which were then fused onto the surface of preformed nanoparticle cores made using poly(lactic co glycolic acid) (PLGA) through a sonication method. As the RBC membrane coating serves as a natural substrate for the poreforming Hla, nanotoxoid(Hla) complexes were formed by incubating free Hla with unloaded nanoparticles, herein denoted nanotoxoid(). Free Hla w as subsequently removed from the nanotoxoid(Hla) complexes by size exclusion chromatography to obtain a purified formulation. Physicochemical characterization showed that the resulting nanotoxoid(Hla) was about 115 nm in diameter and had a surface zeta pot ential of 32 mV (Figure 3.1.2 a,b), both of which were si milar to those of the unloaded nanotoxoid(), suggesting that toxin insertion did not have a major impact on overall nanoparticle properties. This was further confirmed via transmission electron micr oscopy (TEM) of negatively stained nanotoxoid(Hla), which revealed that the characteristic core -shell structure of the RBC membranecoated nanoparticle was preserved even after toxin loading, consistent with what has been previously observed [26, 28] (Figure 3.1.2c ). To confirm successful detainment of Hla by the RBC membranecoated nanoparticles, different immunoassays were performed. On the TEM image, Hla specific antibody labeling of nanotoxoid(Hla) follow ed by secondary labeling using an immunogold conjugate showed significant colocalization of the electrondense gold signal with regions of intermediate density occupied by the nanoparticles, indicating a significant presence of Hlaspecific epitopes on the nanotoxoid(Hla) 107 (Figure 3.1.2d ). Conversely, no gold signal could be detected in the nanotoxoid() sample subjected to the exact same staining procedure, confirming that the positive signal seen in the nanotoxoid(Hla) was not due to nonspecific antibody s taining. Note that in the absence of negative staining, the morphological appearance of the nanotoxoid differs from what is observed in Figure 3.1.3 c. The uranyl acetate stain can act as a fixative, serving to stabilize the nanoparticles and to enhance the core- shell structure of the nanoparticles. Dot blot analysis was used to further confirm the presence of Hla on nanotoxoid(Hla) samples (Figure 3.1.2e ). Using antiHla as the primary immunostain, nanotoxoid(Hla) gave a positive signal whereas nanotoxoid( ) did not give any discernable signal. As a positive control, free Hla at the initial input concentration used to prepare nanotoxoid(Hla) was tested in parallel, and image analysis of the blot intensities revealed that 95% of the Hla was retained on the n anoparticles after purification, suggesting high affinity of the toxin for the membranecoated nanoparticles. It has been shown previously that the strong sequestration of toxin by the nanoparticle detainment strategy resulted in little release over time, which effectively neutralized the activity of the toxin and enables safe delivery both in vitro and in vivo [28]. Next, the ability of the nanotoxoid(Hla) formulation to promote antiHla immune responses was studied. Of particular interest was the formation of germinal centers (GCs), which is a critical step in the potentiation of the humoral immune response against foreign antigens [30, 31] . It is in these regions that B cells mature, and it has been shown that improved retention of antigens via nanoparticle 108 mediated delivery can better facilitate GC formation [32]. We therefore sought to evaluate lymphatic B cell activation in mice immunized with the nanotoxoid(Hla) formulation. Immunostaining was employed to detect the presence of GCs in the dLNs of mice immunized subcutaneously with the nanof ormulation. PBS and unloaded nanotoxoid() were administered as controls. Histological analysis of the dLNs from mice immunized with nanotoxoid(Hla) revealed GL7+ regions Figure 3.1.2: Nanotoxoid(Hla ) characterization. a) Size and [denoted \"NT()\"] and nanotoxoid(Hla) [denoted \"NT(Hla)\"] ( n = 3).

Quantification by image analysis revealed that 95.2% of the Hla input was retained on the final NT(Hla) formulation. 109 characteristic of GC nucleation (Figure 3.1.3 a). In contrast, there was no visual evidence of GC formation in the PBS or nanotoxoid() immunization groups, confirming the nonimmunogenicity of the naturally derived nanoparticle vector itself [33]. Flow cytometry results ( Figure 3.1.3b) showed that 45.6% of B220+IgDlow B cells in the dLNs of the nanotoxoid(Hla) group exhibited a GL 7+ germinal center phenotype. In contrast, only 15.7% and 13.6% of cells in mice administered with PBS and nanotoxoid(), respectively, exhibited the same phenotype. The ability of nanotoxoid(Hla) to elicit a humoral immune response against Hla was further i nvestigated. Mice were subcutaneously injected with nanotoxoid(Hla), nanotoxoid(), or PBS on day 0 and were subsequently administered a booster on day 14. The serum of the mice in each group was sampled on days 0, 14, and 35 to assess Hlaspecific IgG tit ers (Figure 3.1.3c-e). Nanotoxoid(Hla) vaccination elicited significant antiHla titers on day 14, and there was a further increase when assayed on day 35. In contrast, the nanotoxoid() and PBS vaccinations resulted in no detectable antiHla titers over t he course of the study. The nanotoxoid(Hla)induced antibody responses have previously been shown to be durable, with little to no drop in titers over the course of a fivemonth period [28]. Taken together, the data demonstrates that the nanotoxoid(Hla) formulation can effectively elicit potent antiHla immune responses, despite complete deactivation of the toxin [26]. This is notable finding given that the formulation is absent of immunological adjuvants, which are commonly required 110 for conventional toxoid formulations and help to boost germinal center antibody activity [34]. To evaluate the protective capability of the nanotoxoid(Hla) vaccine against MRSA infection, we employed a mouse skin infection model. MRSA represents one of the most common causes of skin infections, both in the community and in hospitals [12]. Because the pathogen is hard to treat with Figure 3.1.3: Germinal center formation and antibody p roduction induced by nanotoxoid(Hla) vaccination. a,b) Mice were vaccinated with PBS, nanotoxoid() [NT( )], or nanotoxoid(Hla) [NT(Hla)] ( n = 3). The draining lymph nodes were collected 21 d later for the analysis of B220 (blue), IgD (green), and GL7 (re d) expression by either immunohistochemistry (a) or flow cytometry (b). Scale bars = 250 m. For flow cytometric analysis, cells were first gated on B220+IgDlow and the numbers reported are the percentage GL7+ cells within that population. Error bars repr esent the standard error. Statistical significance was determined by oneway ANOVA (** P < 0.01). c -e) Mice were vaccinated with PBS, NT(), or NT(Hla) on day 0 with a boost on day 14 (n = 6). On days 0 (c), 14 (d), and 35 (e), serum was collected and the a ntiHla IgG titers were quantified by ELISA. Lines represent geometric means. 111 common antibiotics, the infection can quickly progress and lead to serious complications, from physical disfigurement to permanent organ damage, and in many cases even death. For this experiment, mice were immunized with nanotoxoid(Hla) on day 0 and given a booster dose on day 14. Mice injected with nanotoxoid() or PBS were used as control groups. On day 35, the mice were subcutaneously challenged with live MRSA bacteria, and the efficacy in the different experiment al groups was assessed over time by monitoring the dermonecrotic area resulting from bacterial burden. The progression of skin lesion development in mice immunized with nanotoxoid(Hla) was significantly attenuated compared with mice in the nanotoxoid() an d PBS groups, which both experienced rapid lesion formation (Figure 3.1.4a,b). On day 6 postinfection , there was an approximately fivefold reduction in dermonecrotic area on mice treated with the nanotoxoid(Hla) formulation compared to the control groups. At the conclusion of the observation period, the bacterial burden was quantified in the infected skin region of each mouse (Figure 3.1.4c). For the nanotoxoid() and PBS groups, the bacterial burdens of the infected skin tissue were 1.7 \u00d7 107 and 2.2 \u00d7 107 CFU, respectively. Mice immunized with nanotoxoid(Hla) showed an average burden of 1.5 \u00d7 106 CFU, re presenting 11.3 and 14.7fold reductions compared with the nanotoxoid() and PBS groups, respectively. It has previously been shown that nanotoxoid(Hla) is capable of significantly inhibiting Hlamediated skin damage in the subcutaneous space, suggesting that the titers generated by the formulation are sufficiently high to enable extravascular 112 neutralizing activity [28]. This prevents the necrotic effect of high Hla concentrations [35], thus preserving integrity of the local tissue. In this study, the nanoparticle vaccine formulation was likewise able to reduce skin lesion formation, demonstrating its ability to facilitate neutralization of Hla produced by the bacteria in situ upon subcutaneous challenge. Given the importance of Hla in MRSA pathogenesis, neutralization of the toxin also resulted in decreased bacterial burden, likely due to increased clearance by immune cells protected from the cytotoxic activity of Hla [36]. Despite the significant reduction in both lesion formation and bacterial load at the site of in fection, the inability of the nanotoxoid(Hla) to completely mitigate disease suggests a sizable role played by other virulence factors, which can serve as targets for future nanotoxoid vaccine formulations. MRSA infections can quickly progress and enter sy stemic circulation, leading to a markedly worse prognosis in the clinic [11]. Patients with invasive MRSA can precipitously develop lifethreatening infections in different organs such as the blood, heart, bone, and kidney. As an MRSA skin infection runs the significant risk of further dissemination, the effect of nanotoxoid(Hla) vaccination on MRSA invasiveness after subcutaneous challenge was studied. Mice were vaccinated with nanotoxoid(Hl a), nanotoxoid(), or PBS on day 0 with a booster dose on day 14 and subcutaneously inoculated with MRSA on day 35. On day 6 postinfection, the bacterial counts in the heart, kidney, spleen, lung, and liver were 113 analyzed (Figure 3.1.5). In most of the organs that were analyzed, the nanotoxoid(Hla ) group showed a significant drop in bacterial burden compared to the nanotoxoid() and PBS control groups. Of note, the kidney and spleen, two organs that traditionally experience heavy bacterial burden per unit weight [37], both had reductions of approximately two orders of magnitude. The sharp decrease in organ penetration can likely be attributed primarily to better immune management at the site of infection, which results in improved integrity of the skin Figure 3.1.4: Effect of nanotoxoid(Hla) vaccination on MRSA skin colonization. Mice vaccinated with PBS, nanotoxoid() [NT()], or nanotoxoid(Hla) [NT(Hla)] on days 0 and 14 were challenged subcutaneously with 1 \u00d7 109 CFU of MRSA bacteria on day 35. a) The skin lesions were monit ored over the course of 6 d ( n = 6).

Additionally, the presence of high amounts of neutralizing titers within the body can further hamper the capacity of invading MRSA bacteria to colonize individual organs, as shown by previous studies on the effect of antiHla vaccination in animal models of sepsis [38]. Overall, the results demonstrate that nanotoxoid(Hla) not only prevents superficial damage, but also decreases MRSA invasiveness, which can ultimately help to prevent many of the harsh complications assoc iated with MRSA infections. Figure 3.1.5: Effect of nanotoxoid(Hla) on MRSA Mice vaccinated with PBS, nanotoxoid() [NT()], or nanotoxoid(Hla) [NT(Hla)] on days 0 and 14 were challenged subcutaneously with 1 \u00d7 109 CFU of MRSA bacteria on day 35. On day 6 postinfection, the major organs, including the a) heart, b) kidney, c) spleen, d) lung, and e) liver were collected and the bacterial burden of each was enumerated ( n = 6). Lines represent geometric means. Statisti cal significance was determined by one way ANOVA (** P < 0.01, *** P < 0.001, and **** P < 0.0001). 115 3.1.4 Conclusion This study investigated the use of nanoparticledetained toxins for antivirulence vaccination as a prophylactic strategy against live MRSA skin infection. Such strategies address an important need in the clinical management of bacterial infections as the r ise of antibiotic resistance has been difficult to overcome. An increasing emphasis has been placed on novel strategies that transcend traditional treatment paradigms. The nanotoxoid(Hla) has been shown capable of safely delivering the Hla toxin in its nat ive form without the need for subunit engineering or denaturation. Additionally, the antiHla titers elicited by the nanoformulation are of high avidity and longlived. In this study, we demonstrated that nanotoxoid(Hla) was capable of promoting strong hum oral immunity in an adjuvantfree setting via efficient germinal center formation. Using a mouse skin infection model, it was demonstrated that immunity could substantially attenuate the ability of live bacteria to colonize and systemically invade their ho sts, which could ultimately abrogate the negative consequences of severe MRSA infections. Successful validation of nanotoxoid(Hla) vaccination for protection against live MRSA challenge opens the door for further development of similar platforms against ma ny other common yet deadly bacterial pathogens. Poreforming toxins are one of the most common protein toxins found in nature and represent a large class of virulence factors that have natural affinity for cell membrane substrates [39], and the reported detainment strategy has been shown effective in neutralizing 116 such toxins secreted by several different organism s, including S. aureus, Escherichia coli, and Helicobacter pylori [26]. By targeting the common mechanism by which many virulence factors function, the nanotoxoid formulation can be applied to an entire class of toxins without specific knowled ge of each toxin's precise molecular structure. This strategy opens the door for the nanotoxoid to be used as a diverse vaccine carrier for multitoxin vaccination, as many pathogens secrete multiple membraneattacking virulence factors [40]. By presenting multiple virulent antigens, nanotoxoid can further increase vaccine efficacy and limit bacterial colonization. In addition, changing the m embrane coating material [41-43] could further broaden applicability to toxins that do not specifically target RBCs. Overall, the nanopart iclebased antivirulence vaccine platform is primed to help usher in a new generation of treatments that can address some of the most critical needs in the current management of bacterial infections. 117 3.1.5 Reference s 1.

Nano Lett, 2015. 15(2): p. 1403 In Situ Multiantigenic Nanotoxoid for Antivirulence Vaccination 3.2.1 Introduction The continued rise of antibioticresistant bacteria poses a significant threat to public health, yet the development of new smallmolecule antibiotics remains slow [1]. An increasing number of lives will be at risk as time progresses, and thus finding new and innovative ways to combat these potentially lethal pathoge ns is of extremely high importance [2-6]. Along these lines, antivirulence therapy is a promising strategy for addressing bacterial infection that focuses on removing the offensive weapons used by bacteria to successfully colonize a host [7-9]. Examples of such factors include proteinbased toxins, which can be used to attack host cells via physical disruption, biochemical degradation, or signaling interruption, the reby preventing immune clearance and providing the nutrients necessary for proliferation [10, 11] . Neutralization of these bacterial virulence factors can have a marked impact on bacteria survivability [12]. One major advantage of employing antivirulence therapy is that, unlike with antibiotics, the treatment itself does not exert direct selective pressure on individual bacterium; by focusing instead on blocking pathogentohost interactions, this st rategy can ultimately translate into a reduced likelihood of developing resistance [13]. Implementation of this strategy 123 has varied, ranging from traditional antibody neutralization [14, 15] , to novel nanotechnologybased complexation [16-19]. While antivirulence can be effective in therapeutic settings, arguably the most impactful applications center around prophylactic vaccination. In fact, commonly used vaccines in the clinic against diphtheria and tetanus are targeted against their respective virulence factors [20], underscoring the usefulness of this strateg y. While the immunity generated through antivirulence vaccination can be used to effectively prevent some bacterial infections, others have proven much more difficult to address [21]. A major challenge for creating vaccines against biological toxins is the balance that must be struck between safety and immunogenicity, which often exhibit an inverse relationship [22]. Toxicity can be attenuated via several differ ent approaches, including heat treatment and chemical modification [23]; however, not all toxins are heatlabile, and denatur ation has the potential to compromise vaccine efficacy due to the modified presentation of epitopic target s[24]. Subunit engineering can eliminate virulence, but requires significant upfront investment of resources and is only applicable towards wellcharacterized target s [25]. Vaccine potency is further challenged by the varying secretion profiles of different bacterial species and strains. As many bacteria produce a wide variety of toxins and other factors [26, 27] , it can be difficult to pinpoint which of these are major contributors to pathogenesis. In some cases, vaccination approaches based on multiple known toxins have been shown to carry great utility [28], but these are hard to pursue given the significant time required for identification and 124 confirmation of new virulence factors. While such approaches will undoubtedly be aided by advances in genomic and proteomic technologies, the history of some wellknown toxins, such as streptolysin S secreted by group A streptococcus, underscores the gap that often exists between knowledge and application [29]. To circumvent the need for identification of individual virulence factors, direct derivation from bacterial protein secretions should represent an attractive method to obtain the material needed for generating antivirulence vaccines. However, this strategy has seldom been studied [30, 31] , likely also due to issues in balancing safety and immunogenicity, with the added challenge of having to manage the presence of irrelevant proteins that dilute immune focus. In this work, we report on a facile approach for generating ondemand nanotoxoids from naturally derived bacterial protein preparations by leveraging the near universal natural affinity of virulence factors for cellular membranes [16, 32] (Figure 3.2.1 a membranecoated nanospon ge construct [17], effectively modulating the surface material composition for custom vaccine applications. Following a generalizable workflow that does not require prior knowledge of secreted constituents, pathogenspecific formulations that are safe, potentially multiantigenic, and epitopically fait hful can be fabricated. The feasibility of this approach is demonstrated using methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which employs multiple well characterized toxins [26, 33], as the model pathogen, along with red blood cell (RBC) membranecoated nanosponges as the model vector. 125 3.2.2 Experimental Methods 3.2.2.1 Preparation of Hemolytic Secreted Protein Fraction The MRSA strain USA300 (BAA1717; American Type Culture Collection) was first plated onto a tryptic soy agar (Sigma Aldrich) plate overnight at 37 \u00b0C. A single colony was cultured in 5 mL of tryptic soy broth (TSB; Sigma Aldrich) for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C, and 1 m L was then transferred to another 100 mL of TSB and cultured for 24 h. The media were collected after spinning down the bacteria at 3 000 \u00d7 g for 20 min. Saturated ammonium sulfate (Sigma Aldrich) Figure 3.2.1: Schematic depicting ondemand fabrication of a pathogenspecific nanotoxoid and its vaccination benefits. A) Pathogens secrete virulence factors, which are capable of inserting into target cells and causing their destruction. B) Using nanosponges prepared with the membrane of target cells and incubating the particles with a bacterial supernatantderived protein fraction, it is possible to generate a nanotoxoid carrying pathogenspecific virulence factors. C) After vaccination using the nanotoxoid, antibodie s against the incorporated virulence factors are elicited and can prevent their toxic effects, leaving the intended targets unharmed. 126 solution was added slowly to the media in a glass beaker wh ile stirring at 4 \u00b0C up to a 25% volume ratio. After stirring for 1 h, the solution was centrifuged at 3 000 \u00d7 g for 20 min to pellet the first fraction. Fractions at 50% and 75% volume ratios were collected in the same manner. Finally, solid ammonium sulf ate was added to obtain the equivalent of a 95% saturated solution volume ratio and stirred overnight before collection of the last fraction. All precipitated protein pellets were dissolved in water and desalted using columns packed with fine G25 Sephadex (GE Healthcare). Only the first protein fraction to pass through each column was collected, ultimately yielding concentrated samples free from most other nonprotein contaminants. Hemolytic activity was assessed by adjusting protein solutions to 1\u00d7 phospha te buffered saline (PBS) and incubating at 1 mg mL1with an equal volume of 2.5% purified RBCs collected from male ICR mice (Envigo). All animal experiments were performed in accordance with NIH guidelines and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of California, San Diego. After 30 min of incubation, the samples were spun down at 2 000 \u00d7 g for 5 min. Hemolysis was determined by measuring the absorbance of the supernatant at 540 nm using a Tecan Infinite M200 p late reader. Fractions demonstrating considerable signal were combined together for further use as the hSP fraction. 3.2.2.2 Preparation and Physicochemical Characterization of Nanosponges and Nanotoxoid(hSP) 127 RBCmembranecoated nanosponges were prepared by a previously reported method [34]. Membrane vesicles collected from male ICR mice were coated by a sonication process onto preformed polymeric cores prepared with to prevent hemolysis by the hSP fraction, 400 \u00b5g of the nanosponges was incubated with varying amounts of pro tein ranging from 1 to 50 \u00b5g in 10 wt% sucrose at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min. The mixtures in a volume of 100 \u00b5L were added to an equal volume of 2.5% mouse RBCs in PBS. Equivalent amounts of free hSP in the absence of nanosponges were used for comparison. After ano ther 30 min of incubation at 37 \u00b0C, samples were spun down at 2 000 \u00d7 g for 5 min. Hemolysis was determined by measuring the absorbance of the supernatant at 540 nm using a Tecan Infinite M200 plate reader. A 100% lysis control was prepared by treating the RBCs with Triton X100 (Sigma Aldrich). Subsequent studies were carried out using a ratio of 400 \u00b5g nanosponges incubated directly with 15 \u00b5g of hSP, the product of which was referred to as the nanotoxoid(hSP) formulation. The size and the surface zeta po tential of the nanoformulations were measured by dynamic light scattering using a Malvern ZEN 3600 Zetasizer. The structure of the nanotoxoid(hSP) was examined after negative staining with 1 wt% uranyl acetate (Electron Microscopy Sciences) on a carboncoa ted 400mesh copper grid (Electron Microscopy Sciences) using a Zeiss Libra 120 PLUS EFTEM transmission electron microscope. 128 3.2.2.3 Protein Characterization To visually confirm the presence of bacterial virulence factors on the resulting nanotoxoid(hSP), dot blots were performed to probe for three known toxins secreted by MRSA (toxin, PVL, and toxin). In addition to hSP, nanosponge, and nanotoxoid(hSP), a washed nanotoxoid(hSP) sample was obtained by centrifugation at 21 100 \u00d7 g to separate out unbound proteins. Nanoparticle samples were run at equivalent nanosponge concentrations, and hSP was run at the same concentration as inputted into the nanotoxoid(hS P) formulation. The samples were prepared using lithium dodecyl sulfate sample loading buffer (Invitrogen), heated at 70 \u00b0C for 15 min, and 5 \u00b5L of each was dropped onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Thermo Scientific) followed by drying under vacuum. Membran es were probed using either a polyclonal rabbit primary antibody along with an HRPconjugated antirabbit IgG (Biolegend) as the secondary antibody. Blots were developed with ECL western blotting substrate (Pierce) using an ImageWorks MiniMedical/90 Developer. Western blotting was carried out to quantitatively determine the amoun t of toxins that remained bound to the nanoparticles. Nanotoxoid(hSP) and washed nanotoxoid(hSP) were prepared in the same manner as above and run on NuPAGE Novex 4% blots were probed toxin, PVL LukS subunit, or toxin B. Band intensities were measured using Adobe Photoshop and normalized to the average values of the no wash nanotoxoid(hSP) sample for each toxin. To determine the composition of the final hSP preparation, different dilutions of the hSP protein, alongside purified toxin (Sigma Aldrich), LukS subunit (IBT Bioservices), and toxin B (IBT Bioservices), were subjected to western blot analysis. Linear standard curves were generated using the hSP dilutions upon probing for each toxin. Composition percentages were determined as the concentration of each purified toxin divided by the interpolated hSP concentration based on the band intensities measured for that specific toxin ( n = 3; mean \u00b1 SD). To perform the release study, nanotoxoid(hSP) at a concentration of 2 mg mL1 was placed into a 300 kDa MWCO FloatALyzer G2 (Spectrum Laboratories) and dialyzed against 2 L of 1\u00d7 PBS. Samples were collected at 0 and 48 h a nd probed for toxin, PVL LukS subunit, or toxin B by western blotting. Values were normalized to the average band intensities of the 0 h samples for each toxin. 3.2.2.4 In Vitro Safety To assess hemolytic activity, hSP (15 \u00b5g), heattreated hSP (15 \u00b5g (400 \u00b5g), and nanotoxoid(hSP) with 15 \u00b5g of hSP for 30 min) were added in 150 \u00b5L of solution to an equal volume of 2.5% mouse RBCs in PBS. Note that the 130 nanoparticle concentration employed was near the maximum feasible value allowed by the nanotoxoid fabrication process. After 30 min of incubation at 37 \u00b0C, each sample was spun down and the absorbance of hemoglobin in the supernatant was measured at 540 n m using a Tecan Infinite M200 plate reader. Bone marrow derived dendritic cells were isolated from ICR mice and cultured as reported before [35]. To assess cytotoxicity, the cells were plated into 96well plates and \u00b5g hSP). After 24 h of incubation with the different samples, the cells were cultured for another 48 h in fresh media. Cell viability was assayed using an MTT reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Untreated cells were used as the 100% viability control. 3.2.2.5 In Vivo Safety Male ICR mice were first shaved to remove the hair on their back. Subsequently, 150 \u00b5L of blank solution, hSP (22.5 hSP) was injected subcutaneously. A fter 48 h, the mice were euthanized, and skin samples at the site of injection, where most of the nanoparticles were expected to remain, were collected for histological processing. Sections were stained either by hematoxylin and using situ apoptosis detection kit (EMD 131 Millipore). Brightfield images were acquired using a Hamamatsu Nanozoomer slide scanning system. 3.2.2.6 Germinal Center Formation Sixweekold male ICR mice were administered with blank solution, heat treated hSP (7.5 \u00b5g), nanosponge (200 with 7.5 \u00b5g hSP) by hock injection. On day 21 after immunization, the draining popliteal lymph nodes wer e collected for analysis. For immunohistochemistry, the lymph nodes were cryosectioned and BZ9000 microscope. For flow cytometric analysis, the popliteal lymph nodes were dissociated into single cell suspensions using 1 mg mL1 collagenase D (Roche ) and 1 mg mL1 DNAse I (Roche). The cells were then stained with the above antibodies followed by data collection on a BD FACSCanto II flow cytometer. Analysis was performed using Flowjo software. 3.2.2.7 Antibody Titer Responses Sixweekold male ICR mice were vaccinated by subcutaneous injections at the neck region with blank solution, heattreated hSP (75 \u00b5g), or nanotoxoid(hSP) (2 mg of nanosponge with 75 \u00b5g hSP) on days 0, 7, and 14. On 132 day 21, the blood of each mouse was collected, and the serum was subsequ ently derived by centrifugation at 700 \u00d7 g. Antibody titers were assessed by an indirect ELISA using plates coated with purified toxin, PVL LukS subunit, or toxin A (IBT Bioservices) following a previously reported protocol [12]. 3.2.2.8 Protective Efficacy against MRSA Infection Sixweekold male ICR mice were immunized using the same formulations and schedule as above. For the subcutaneous model, 1 \u00d7 109 CFU of MRSA USA300 was inoculated into the shaved back region away from the site of vaccination on day 35. The lesion on the skin of each mouse was monitored daily and reported as the width multiplied by the length of the visibly affected area. For the systemic model, 2 \u00d7 106 CFU of MRSA USA300 was injected via the tail vein. On day 3 after challenge, the blood was first collected prior to euthanasia. The mice were then perfused with PBS, and the liver, spleen, heart, lungs, and kidneys of each mouse were collected and processed for bacterial enumeration following a previously published protocol [12]. To obtain the total bacteria count, the values from all collected organs for each individual mouse were summed. 3.2.3 Results and Discussion We first confirmed that RBC nanosponges could be used to effectively neutralize the harmful biological activity of proteins secreted by MRSA strain 133 USA300. Using a hemolytic secreted protein (hSP) fraction collected f rom bacterial culture supernatant via ammonium sulfate precipitation, it was demonstrated that preincubation with a sufficient amount of RBC nanosponges could effectively eliminate the hSP's lytic effects on RBCs ( Figure 3.2.2 A). From the data, 400 \u00b5g of nanosponges could be used to neutralize 15 \u00b5g of the protein, and this ratio was used to fabricate an hSPloaded nanosponge vaccine formulation, termed nanotoxoid(hSP), for further study. According to dynamic light scattering measurements, the size of the nanotoxoid(hSP) was slightly larger and the surface zeta potential was less negative when compared to the blank nanosponges without hSP loading, both suggesting the association of the hSP with the membranecoated nanoparticle substrate (Figure 3.2.2 B,C). T ransmission electron microscopy confirmed that, after protein loading, nanotoxoid(hSP) still exhibited a characteristic core -shell structure [36, 37] , with a membrane layer surrounding the polymeric core (Figure 3.2.2 D). While previous versions of nanotoxoids have worke d with individual, purified toxins [12, 38] , the advantage of the present approach is its ability to entrap and neutralize pathogenspecific virulence factors from a protein preparation with unknown composition. To validate this concept, we probed the nanotoxoid(hSP) formulation for the presence of known virulence factors by immunoblotting (Figure 3.2.2 E). Of the three different antigens that were analyzed, all were easily detectable on the nanotoxoid(hSP). These included toxin, a major MRSA virulence factor that has previously been successfully n eutralized using RBC 134 nanosponges [17], as well as Panton -Valentine leukocidin (PVL), a white blood cell in most communityacquired MRSA variants [39, 40], and toxin, a bicomponent toxin formed from combinations of three different monomers [41]. Quantitative western blot analysis demonstrated that toxin, PVL, and toxin contributed to the total bacterial protein, respectively (see Experimental Section). After subjecting the nanotoxoid(hSP) to a wash step, the three toxins remained strongly present (Figure 3.2.2 F). Additionally, the toxins rem ained mostly bound to the nanoparticles even after dialyzing against physiological buffer for 48 h (Figure 3.2.2 G), which suggested stable and efficient complexation and explained the ability of the nanoparticles to neutralize the toxins' hemolytic activit y. Given the robust binding of the toxins with the nanosponges, we further sought to evaluate the safety of the nanotoxoid(hSP) formulation in various settings. First, we compared the hemolytic capacity of hSP in its native form, when subjected to rigorous heat denaturation, and when in nanotoxoid(hSP) form (Figure 3.2.3 A,B). Native hSP demonstrated complete lysis while nanotoxoid(hSP) fabricated with an equivalent amount of hSP had almost no activity; this neutralization effect has previously been shown to be exclusive to membrane coated nanoparticles [17]. As expected, blank nanosponges were not hemolytic, but it was striking that, even after boiling the hSP for 4 h, 40% of its hemolytic activity was still preserved. While specific toxins secreted by MRSA a re known to be heatlabile [38], the results demonstrated that the more complex hSP preparation 135 contained elements that were not sensitive to temperature. The data also hint that nanospongebased neutralization, despite its nondenaturing approach, may also be more universally applicable. The results were mirrored when the same formulatio ns were incubated with bonemarrowderived dendritic cells (Figure 3.2.3 C). The hSP preparation completely killed the cells in vitro , and the heattreated proteins also Figure 3.2. 2: Synthesis and characterization of hemolyticsecretedprotein (hSP) loaded incubated with varying amounts of hSP in the absence or presence of 400 \u00b5g of RBC nanosponges (n = 3; mean \u00b1 SD). B) Size of RBC nanosponges and nanotoxoid(hSP) as measured by dynamic light scattering ( n = 3; mean \u00b1 SD). C) Sur face zeta potential of nanosponges and nanotoxoid(hSP) ( n = 3; mean \u00b1 SD). D) Transmission electron microscope image of nanotoxoid(hSP) negatively stained with uranyl acetate (scale bar = 100 nm). E) Dot blots probing for toxin, PVL, or toxin in hSP, b lank nanosponges, nanotoxoid(hSP), or nanotoxoid(hSP) subject to a wash step. F) Relative band intensities of western blots probing for toxin, PVL, or toxin in nanotoxoid(hSP) or nanotoxoid(hSP) subject to a wash step ( n = 3; mean \u00b1 SD). G) Retention o f toxin, PVL, or toxin on nanotoxoid(hSP) after dialyzing against 1 \u00d7 PBS for 48 h ( n = 3; mean \u00b1 SD). 136 had significant toxicity, leading to only 20% of the cells remaining viable. On the other hand, both the nanotoxoid(hSP) and blank nanosponges showed no signs of cytotoxicity, again demonstrating the ability of nanocomplexation to much more effectively eliminate the harmful biological effects of the toxins. In vivo , we assessed potential tox icity by administering the different formulations subcutaneously followed by histological analysis after 48 h (Figure 3.2.3 D). Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining showed induced significant atrophy in the squamous epithelium and scattered bleeding in the dermal as well as subcutaneous tissues. Disarrangement and degeneration of collagen fibers were also observed. The toxicity of the protein was further demonstrated by TUNEL staining, which revealed widespread apoptosis throughout. In contra st, there was no obvious skin damage in the other three samples; the structure of the skin remained intact and orderly with minimal signs of apoptosis. While the heated hSP displayed considerable toxicity in vitro , the in vivo results suggest that the part ial attenuation afforded by the heat treatment was sufficient to prevent it from reaching the threshold required for inducing significant damage in a more complex biological setting. Given the relative safety of the heat treated hSP demonstrated here, we e lected to employ it as a control in subsequent functional studies as a comparison against nanotoxoid(hSP). Following the safety evaluation, the ability of the nanotoxoid(hSP) formulation to elicit potent humoral immunity was studied. The induction of germinal centers withi n lymph nodes is one of the critical steps in the immune 137 response against infection, and it is in these regions where affinitybased maturation of B cells occurs [42]. To study the effect of the different formulations on this phenomenon, draining lymph nodes were collected 21 d after immunization and analyzed for the presence of B cells with the corresponding phenotype (Figure 3.2.4 A,B). Flow cytometric analysis revealed that, of the different formulations, only the nanotoxoid(hSP) could significantly raise the percentage of B cells with the germinal center marker GL7, with the value increasing to 44% Figure 3.2. 3: In vitro and in vivo safety studies. A) Comparison of hemolysis induced by hSP, hSP, n = 3; mean \u00b1 SD). B) Representative images demonstrating the varying degrees of hemolysis in the samples from (A). C) Comparison of bonem arrowderived dendritic cell viability after 24 h hSP, heattreated hSP, blank nanosponge, or nanotoxoid(hSP) followed by another 48 h of culture ( n = 4; mean \u00b1 SD). D) Hematoxylin staining of skin samples colle cted from untreated mice or from mice 48 h after subcutaneous injection of hSP, heattreated hSP, blank nanosponge, or nanotoxoid(hSP) (scale bars = 100 \u00b5m). 138 compared with 19% for the blank control. This was also evident by immunofluorescence staining of histological sections, which indicated the presence of several nodules with a high concentration of GL7+ cells in the lymph nodes of mice from the nanotoxoid(hSP) group. Of note, heattreat ed hSP did not result in the formation of germinal centers despite delivering the same antigenic material. Additionally, blank nanosponges had no effect, precluding any adjuvanting contributions from the nanoparticle vector itself and suggesting a favorabl e biocompatibility profile [38]. From the data, it appears that the particulate delivery of undenatured ba cterial hSP facilitates the generation of strong immune responses. To test how the increased response to the nanoformulation would translate into antigenspecific immunity, we quantified the titers generated against known Figure 3.2. 4: Germinal center formation. A) Flow cytometric analysis of cells at the draining lymph node 21 d after administration with blank solution, heattreated hSP, blank nanosponge, or nanotoxoid(hSP) ( n = 4; mean \u00b1 SD). Cells were first gated on the B220+IgDlow population and values are expressed as percentage GL7+. B) Fluorescent images of draining lymph node histological sections stained with antibodies against B220 (green), IgD (blue), and GL7 (red) at different magnifications 4\u00d7 objective, scale bar = 500 \u00b5m; bottom: objective, scale bar = 100 0.001, **** p < 0.0001, oneway ANOVA. 139 constituents present on the nanotoxoid(hSP), including toxin, PVL, and toxin (Figure 3.2.5 A-C). To compare the different antigencontaining formulations, mice were vaccinated with a prime injection plus two boosts on days 7 and 14. On day 21, around the p eak of IgG responses, the serum was sampled and titers analyzed by indirect enzymelinked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). For toxin, which is one of the most highly secreted by MRSA, there was an easily detectable difference in antibody production. This i s consistent with previous reports on a nanotoxoid formulated with purified toxin [12, 38] . Heattreated hSP was approximately two orders of magnitude less effective. For PVL, 57% of the mice exhibited highly elevated titers when vaccinated with the nanotoxoid(hSP), while the other portion were nonresponders. This represented a large improvement compared with the heattreated hSP group, which had titer values near baseline. While the results for toxin were less pronounced, the ef fect of nanotoxoid(hSP) vaccination still bordered on significance. It appeared that the trend in titer production reflected the relative amounts of each toxin in the hSP preparation. In total, the nanotoxoid(hSP) formulation was more adept at eliciting an titoxin immune responses compared with the heattreated protein formulation, despite both delivering the same antigenic material. Finally, we evaluated the effectiveness of nanotoxoid(hSP) vaccination in preventing live bacterial infection by employing MRS A strain USA300 in two 140 separate in vivo models reflective of how the disease presents in the clinic [43, 44]. For both studies , mice were vaccinated with a prime injection plus two boosts on days 7 and 14. On day 35 after the first administration, mice were challenged with bacteria, and the impact of antivirulence immunity on bacterial survival was assessed. In the subcutaneous m odel, which mimics the skin infections common to MRSA [45], the nanotoxoid(hSP) had a striking effect on skin lesion formation (Figure 3.2.6 A). On the final day of the study, those receiving the nanotoxoid(hSP) had, on average, a threefold smaller affected area compared to mice vaccinated with heattreated hSP. Similarly, the nanotoxoid(hSP) performed well in controlling bacterial growth upon intravenous injection, which was used to model potentially lifethreatening systemic MRSA infections [46] (Figure 3.2.6 B,C). Looking at the Figure 3.2. 5: Multivalent antibody responses in vivo . Mice were vaccinated with blank solution, heattreated hSP, or nanotoxoid(hSP) on day 0 with boosts on days 7 and 14. On day 21, the serum was sampled and analyzed for the presence of IgG antibody titers against A) toxin, B) PVL, and C) toxin ( n = 7; geometric mean). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, **** p < 0.0001, oneway ANOVA. 141 total bacterial load 3 d after challenge, mice vaccinated with the nanotoxoid(hSP) were able to much more effectively clear out the MRSA bacteria compared to those receiving heattrea ted hSP. At the organ level, the effect was most apparent in the heart, lungs, and especially the kidneys. Overall, the results are a reflection of the differences seen in titer production among the formulations and highlight the stronger immunity generate d by the nanotoxoid(hSP) formulation, which inhibits the ability of the bacteria to survive over time.

The nanoformulation was able to entrap virulence factors from protein preparations of unknown composition, was safe both in vitro and in vivo , and could elicit functional immunity capable of combating live bacterial infections. Despite containing the same bacterial antigens, the nanotoxoid(hSP) formulation consistently outperformed a denatured protein preparation in all of the metrics studied, which underscores the utility of biomimetic nanoparticlebased ne utralization and delivery. Overall this strategy helps to address major hurdles in the design of antivirulence vaccines, enabling increased antigenic breadth while maintaining safety. Looking forward, the workflow presented here can easily be modified for application toward a variety of different pathogens. It may be possible to employ personalized culture isolates or to change culture conditions such that virulence factor production is modulated. Alternatively, nanotoxoid formulations can be screened to id entify a broadly neutralizing option that is effective across multiple bacterial strains. Other purification or fractionation strategies can be tested to emphasize nonhemolytic virulence factors, and different membrane substrates derived from other cell ty pes can be leveraged [47-49]. The inclusion of immunological adjuvants can also be considered to further boost efficacy [50-52]. Ultimately, the success of antivirulence vaccines may help to control the spread of many deadly diseases and abate the rising threat of antibioticresistant bacteria. 143 Chapter 3, in full, is a reprint of the material as it appears in Advanced Functional Materials , 2016, Fei Wang, Ronnie Fang, Brian Luk, Che -Ming Soracha and Liangfang Zhang, and Advanced Materials, 2017, Xiaoli Wei, Jie Gao, Fei Wang, Man Ying, Pavimol Angsantikul, Ashley Kroll, Jiarong Zhou, Weiwei Gao, Weiyue Lu, Ronnie Fang and Liangfang Zhang.

One of their main functions is to stop bleeding via initiation and propagation of the coagulation cascade [1, 2] . Platelet count is universally regarded as the key indicator of bleeding risk, and the normal range in healthy people sits between 150,000 and 450,000 platelets per microliter of blood. A count under the normal range, termed thrombocytopenia, can be due to either decreased platelet production or increased platelet destruction. Clinically, the disease can manifest itself as purpura, a delay in the normal process of clotting, and spontaneous or excessive bleeding. When platelet counts drop substantially lower than normal values, internal hemorrhaging can occur, a severe condition that can potentially be fat al [3]. Immune thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP), which is oftentimes also referred as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, is an immune -mediated hematological disorder characterized by low level of platelets and easy or excessive bleeding due to the presence of anti -platelet autoantibodies [4, 5] . These pathological antibodies bind to specific a ntigens on the platelet surface, leading to sequestration and destruction by the reticuloendothelial system. The age -adjusted prevalence of ITP is estimated to be 9.5 per 100,000 persons in the United States [6]. While the condition may appear secondary to a known autoimmune condition or infection, oftentimes the underlying etiology is unclear [7-9]. Given this fact, chronic ITP is 151 classically treated using nonspecific therapies such as corticosteroids. While capable of eliciting a rebound in platelet levels in many patients, such treatments are susceptible to relapse and can cause unwanted side effects [5, 10] . For those that fail to respond to frontline treatments, invasive and irreversible splenectomy is a common intervention, but has the chance of postoperative complications such as infection, bleeding, and hospitalization [11, 12] . Other second - carry significant iatrogenic risk given their generally non-specific modes of action. With the probability of high side effects, treatment can ultimately be more burdensome than the original disease. With these consideratio ns in mind, the development of a treatment modality that can specifically target the pathological moieties responsible for ITP is highly desirable. Cell membrane -coated nanoparticles represent an increasingly popular platform for a variety of applications, including drug delivery [17], vaccination [18, 19], and detoxification [20, 21] . A significant factor behind their appeal is the ability to replicate the surface properties of different cell types faithfully on nanoparticle surfaces. Employing biological materials through a top -down coating approach bestows synthetic nanoparticles with native cell functionalities. For example, it has been shown that coa ting with red blood cell membrane actively modulates residence time in the bloodstream via the display of self -markers that are recognized by the immune system [22]. Functionalization with platelet membrane 152 enables biomimetic targeting by taking advantage of the natural interactions between platelet surface markers and different targets, including damaged vasculatu re and pathogens [23, 24] . Given the wide range of biological interactions that natural cell membranes p articipate in, the potential of cell membrane -coated nanoparticles extends far beyond traditional nanodelivery applications. One such area is biodetoxification where the membrane coating serves as an ideal substrate for interaction with biological toxins, enabling their neutralization and subsequent clearance. For example, red blood cell membrane -coated nanoparticles have previously been shown to bind and clear both bacterial toxins [20] as well as small molecule poisons [21]. Here, we demonstrated the use of platelet -derived membrane as a natural biomaterial for the design of nanoparticulate decoys that can effectively bind and clear th e pathological antibodies responsible for ITP ( Figure 4.1) . The binding capacity and specificity of platelet membrane -coated nanoparticles (PNPs) were evaluated before studying the neutralization capacity of PNPs against anti -platelet antibodies both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, an antibody -induced murine model of ITP was employed in order to assess treatment efficacy. As a possible new treatment for ITP, PNP administration holds distinct advantages compared to current therapies. By using the natural subs trate of the pathological agent, the treatment is highly specific, which may prevent the immune compromising side effects commonly seen with other treatments. Further, by diverting anti -platelet antibodies away from healthy platelets, PNPs directly act to preserve normal 153 hemostatic function. Ultimately, employing this biomimetic nanoparticle system for the specific treatment of ITP may se rve to improve patient outcomes in the clinic. Figure 4.1: Schematic of platelet membrane -coated immune thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP). (A) To fabricate PNPs, the plasma membrane from fresh platelets is derived and then coated onto poly(lactic -co- glycolic acid) (PLGA) poly meric nanoparticle cores, transferring the surface antigenic material from the original cells onto the outside of the nanoparticles. (B) Without treatment, ITP is characterized by the binding of pathological autoantibodies to healthy platelets, resulting i n their clearance by the reticuloendothelial system. (C) When PNPs are administered, they act as decoys that bind to the pathological autoantibodies, neutralizing them from circulation and enabling the survival of healthy platelets. 154 4.2 Experimental Methods 4.2.1 Animals Male CD -1mice (6 -week old; 20 -24 g body weight) were purchased from Harlan Laboratories. All animal experiments were performed in accordance with NIH guidelines and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of California, San Diego. 4.2.2 Platelet Isolation and Membrane Derivatio n Whole blood was collected from male adult CD -1 mice (Harlan Laboratories) via puncture of the subm andibular vein with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA; USB Corporation) as the anticoagulant. To isolate platelets, the blood was first centrifuged at 300 g for 5 min at room temperature. The supernatant then was collected and spun at the same speed for another 5 min. The resulting supernatant, representing a platelet rich plasma, was then centrifuged at 2000 g for 4 min in order to pellet down the platelets, which were resuspended in water, aliquoted, and stored at 80 \u00b0C for further use. Platel et membrane was derived by a repeated freeze -thaw process. A frozen aliquot of purified platelets was allowed to thaw at room temperature, centrifuged at 21,000 g for 7 min, and the pellet was resuspended in water. The platelet suspension 155 was refrozen, and the process was repeated three times. The pellet was finally resuspended in water, and the membrane protein concentration was quantified using a commercial BCA assay (Pierce). 4.2.3 Preparation and Characterization of Platelet Membrane -Coated Nanoparticles (PNP s) PNPs were prepared using a previously reported sonication method [24]. Polymeric nano particle cores were a nanoprecipitation process. A volume of 1 mL of a 10 mg/mL PLGA solution in acetone was added rapidly to 4 mL of water. The acetone was then allowed to evaporate under vacuum for 3 h. PNPs were prepared by fusing platelet membrane onto PLGA cores via sonication using a Fisher Scientific FS30D bath sonicator at a frequency of 42 kHz and a power of 100 W for 2 min. The size and zeta-potential of PNPs were measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS) using a Malvern ZEN 3600 Zetasizer. To study the morphology of PNPs by transmission electronic microscopy (TEM), samples were deposited onto a 400 -mesh carbon - coated copp er grid (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and negatively stained with vanadium (Abcam). 156 4.2.4 Platelet Membrane to Nanoparticle Ratio Optimization To optimize the platelet membrane to PLGA core ratio, PNPs were synthesized at membrane -to-core weight ratios ranging from 0.125 to 2 at a final polymer concentration of 1 mg/mL. PLGA cores without membrane coating were included as a control. The sizes of each set of particles were first measured by DLS immediately after synthesis. Afterwards, the particle solutio ns were adjusted to 1 \u00d7 PBS by adding an equal volume of 2 \u00d7 PBS and the particle sizes were measured again. An increase in size upon introduction of PBS was used as an indicator of particle instability. 4.2.5 In Vitro Binding Capacity and Specificity Studies To evaluate the in vitro binding capacity of PNPs, 10 g of the nanoparticles was mixed with different amounts (2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128 g) of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) -labeled polyclonal anti -mouse thrombocyte antibodies (Lifespan Biosciences). The precise antigen specificity of the antibodies was unknown. After mixing the PNPs with antibodies, the fluorescence intensity of the fluorescently labeled antibody was measured using a Tecan Infinite M200 plate reader. The mixtures were in cubated for 10 min at 37 \u00b0C, then centrifuged at 21,000 g for 8 min to pellet the PNP/anti -platelet complexes. The fluorescence intensity of the supernatant was measured and used to calculate the amount of 157 antibody that had bound to the PNPs. To evaluate bi nding specificity, either 10 g of PNPs or 10 g of polyethylene glycol -functionalized nanoparticles (PEG -NPs) [25] were mixed with 32 g of FITC -labeled antibody. To test the binding capacity in serum, 10 g of PNPs were incubated with 128 g of FITC -labeled antibody in either PBS or 50 vol% mouse serum. 4.2.6 In Vitro Neutralization For the pre -incubation study, 20 g of FITC -labeled anti -platelet antibody was incubated with varying amounts of PNP (5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 g) or PBS at 37 \u00b0C for 15 min. The mixture was then added to a solution containing the number of platelets equivalent to 40 g worth of membrane mate rial and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 15 min. For competitive co -incubation study, the same amounts of PNPs and antibody were concurrently added to the platelets. All samples were then washed by centrifugation at 2000 g three times with PBS. The amount of antibod y binding to platelets was measured by flow cytometry on a Becton Dickinson FACSCanto II flow cytometer and analyzed using Treestar Flow Jo. 4.2.7 In Vivo Binding Stability To establish a mouse model of thrombocytopenia, 6 -week old CD -1 mice were injected intraperitoneally with PBS or 50 g of anti -thrombocyte antibody. 158 The mice were bled before injection as well as 4 h and 24 h after injection for platelet enumeration. Male 6 -week old CD -1 mice were injected intraperitoneally with either 50 g of anti-mouse thrombocyte antibody (Lifespan Biosciences) pre - incubated with 100 g of PNPs, 50 g of antibody alone, or PBS. Blood was sampled by submandibular vein puncture both before and 24 h after injection using EDTA as the anticoagulant. To enumerate t he platelets, a 1 L volume of blood was diluted 1000 times in 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma Aldrich) in PBS. The diluted solution was then stained with FITC -labeled anti -mouse CD41 (Biolegend) for labeling of platelets, and flow cytometry was used to cou nt the number of FITC+ events per given volume. 4.2.8 In Vivo Treatment Male 6 -week old CD -1 mice were injected intraperitoneally with 50 g of anti-thrombocyte antibody to induce thrombocytopenia. After 15 min, mice received either 400 g of PNPs, 400 g of PEG -NPs, or PBS via tail vein injection. Blood was sampled both before and 24 h after administration of antibody. To assess the effect of treatment on bleeding time, mice were first anesthetized 24 h after antibody administration with a cocktail of 150 mg/kg ketamine (Zoetis) and 10 mg/kg xylazine (Lloyd Laboratories). For the bleeding time assay, a tail segment 5 mm from the distal end was excised by a sterile blade, and the cut end of the tail was immediately placed into 37 \u00b0C saline solution in a 50 mL tube. The time from 159 amputation to complete cessation of bleeding was recorded for each mouse. Those mice bleeding longer than a pre -determ ined time limit of 20 min were euthanized immediately. 4.3 Results and Discussion PNPs were prepared by fusing mouse platelet -derived membrane onto the surface of poly(lactic -co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticle cores [24]. In brief, platelets collected from whole blood were subjected to repeated freeze -thaw cycles and centrifugation in order to obtain purified membrane. The membrane was then coated onto the surface of preformed PLGA nanoparticles by a sonication process. After the membrane coat ing, dynamic light scattering indicated an approximately 20 nm increase in the average hydrodynamic diameter over that of the bare PLGA cores ( Figure 4.2A). Zeta potential measurements also suggested successful coating, as evidenced by the increase in surf ace charge of the coated nanoparticles to approximately the same level as a membrane vesicle only sample ( Figure 4.2B). Moreover, transmission electron microscopy of negatively stained PNPs revealed a characteristic core -shell structure with a layer of mem brane coated over the polymer core ( Figure 4.2C ). In order to optimize the membrane coating ratio, PNPs were prepared using different membrane to PLGA core weight ratios ranging from 0.125 to 2 ( Figure 4.2D ). After adjusting to 1 \u00d7 phosphate buffered salin e (PBS) solution, which represents physiological salt concentrations, bare PLGA cores with 160 no membrane coating aggregated immediately due to charge screening effects. With increasing amounts of membrane, there was a trend of decreasing aggregation. At a ra tio of 1 to 1, no apparent size increase was observed, and this formulation was chosen for further studies. The particles also demonstrated little change in size and distribution when subjected to high shear conditions. Figure 4.2: Characterization and optimization of PNPs. (A) Hydrodynamic size of bare PLGA cores, platelet vesicles, and PNPs as measured by dynamic light scattering (n = 3; mean \u00b1 SD). (B) Surface zeta potential of bare PLGA cores, platelet vesicles, and PNPs (n = 3; mean \u00b1 SD). (C) Transmission electron microscopy images of PNPs negatively stained with vanadium (scale bar = 75 nm). (D) Sizes of PNPs fabricated with varying membrane protein to PLGA weight ratios measured both immediately after synthesis in deionized wa ter and after adjusting to 1 \u00d7 PBS buffer solution (n = 3; mean \u00b1 SD). 161 To investigate the binding capability of PNPs to anti -platelet antibodies, 10 g (polymer weight) of PNPs were incubated with different amounts of fluorescently labeled polyclonal anti -platelet antibodies ranging from 2 g to 128 g (Figure 4.3A). Quantification based on the fluorescent signal showed a linear increase in antibody binding at lower concentrations, after which the binding plateaued. From the plotted data, it was interpolat ed that 50% binding occurred at a polyclonal antibody input of approximately 25 g. The experiment was also repeated keeping the amount of antibody constant while varying the PNP concentration. To assess the specificity of the PNP -antibody interaction, bin ding was compared to a control polyethylene glycol -functionalized lipid -polymer hybrid nanoparticle (PEG -NP) [25] (Figure 4.3B). Using an equivalent amount of either PNPs or PEG -NPs, it was demonstrated that, comparatively, the PEGylated nanoparticles exhibited the near absence of antibody binding. The different results observed between the two types of nanoparticles indicate that t he platelet membrane bestows specific binding properties. Additionally, an isotype antibody not specific to platelet membrane also showed no binding to the PNPs. Furthermore, to evaluate the effect of the presence of other proteins, the binding of antibody to PNPs was tested in the presence of mouse serum ( Figure 4.3C). Compared with binding in PBS, there was little difference observed for the sample tested in serum, indicating the potential of the nanoparticles retain their function within the complex biol ogical environment found in vivo. 162 To characterize the ability of PNPs to neutralize anti -platelet antibodies in vitro , different amounts of PNPs ranging from 0 to 100 g were pre - incubated with a constant amount of fluorescently labeled anti -platelet antibodies. This was followed by the addition of fresh platelets to the mixture and analysis of antibody binding to the platelets by flow cytometry ( Figure 4.4A and B). It was shown that fluorescent signal sharply decreased with increasing amount of PNPs. Using 20 g of polyclonal anti -platelet antibodies, it was observed that approximately 5 -10 g of PNPs were able to reduce mean fluorescence intensity by 50%, a ratio that was in line with what was observed from the antibody binding study. To evaluate the neutralization capacity in a competitive setting, both PNPs and fresh platelets were simultaneously incubated with the antibodies ( Figure 4.4C Figure 4.3: In vitro binding of anti -platelet antibodies to PNPs. (A) Fluorescent quantification of anti -platelet antibody binding to PNPs. A constant amount of PNPs (10 g) was incubated with varying amounts of fluorescently labeled antibodies (n = 3; mean \u00b1 SEM). (B) Relative binding of anti -platelet antibodies to either PNPs or PEGylated nanoparticles (PEG -NPs) (n = 3; mean \u00b1 SD). (C) Relative binding of anti - platelet antibodies to PNPs in either PBS or mouse s erum (n = 3; mean \u00b1 SD). 163 and D). In this scenario, mean fluorescence intensity was halved at approximately 20 g of PNPs using 20 g of antibodies. The antibody signal on the platelets decreased slower with increasing PNP concentration compared with the pre - incubation scenario, reflecting the increased challenge in neutralizing antibodies when both nanoparticle and fresh platelets comp ete for binding at the same time. Despite this fact, a great deal of neutralization capacity was still observed, indicating strong potential for therapeutic use.

Ctrl = no antibody. 164 After confirming that PNPs could neutralize anti -platelet antibodies in vitro , their binding stability in vivo was assessed ( Figure 4.5). To conduct the experiment, a previously established murine model of immune thrombocytopenia was employed [26]. When anti -platelet antibodies alone were administered intraperitoneally, their diffusion across the peritoneal membrane induced ve ry obvious thrombocytopenia. Platelet counts dropped dramatically even 4 h post -injection and the challenged mice exhibited a more than 90% reduction in platelet counts 24 h post -injection. When the antibodies were pre -incubated with PNPs, followed by inje ction of the mixture, platelet counts were preserved to levels not statistically different from those of mice administered with only blank solution. The results suggest a strong binding interaction of the anti -platelet antibodies with the PNPs, which preve nts the release of the pathological antibodies and thereby preventing their ability to cause the clearance of healthy platelets. The ability of the PNPs to maintain antibody neutralization within the complex in vivo biological environment was encouraging and motivated further study on the ability of the nanoparticles to perform this function in situ in a therapeutic setting. Finally, the ability of PNPs to be used as a means for the therapeutic treatment of immune thrombocytopenia in vivo was assessed. Mice were first intraperitoneally administered a bolus dose of anti -platelet antibodies capable of causing a marked reduction of platelet counts. This was followed by intravenous administration of either blank solution, PEG -NPs, or PNPs. Blo od was sampled both before and 24 h after challenge with anti -platelet antibodies, and platelet count 165 was determined ( Figure 4.6A). Without any treatment, platelet counts dropped dramatically after 24 h and were approximately 10% of their original value. A similar drop was seen when mice were treated with PEG -NPs, which could not bind the antibodies and were unable to rescue pl atelet counts. In contrast, those mice treated with PNPs exhibited a marked increase in preservation of platelet number with final values at approximately 70% of pre -challenge values. In order to demonstrate the importance of this platelet preservation on maintenance of hemostatic capacity, a bleeding time test, which is a commonly used in vivo assay for evaluating platelet function, was carried out ( Figure 4.6B). After tail tip excision and immediate immersion into a warmed saline solution, the amount of time to bleeding cessation was recorded. For unchallenged mice, the Figure 4.5: In vivo neutralization of anti -platelet antibody activity by PNPs. Mice were intraperitoneally administered with PBS, anti-platelet antibodies, or the antibodies pre - incubated with PNPs (n = 8; mean \u00b1 SEM). Blood was collected both before and 24 h after administration to quantify platelet counts. ***P < 0.001, NS = not significant, Student's t-test. 166 bleeding stopped on average between 1 and 2 min after excision, whereas those of anti-plate let antibody -challenged mice with no treatment exhibited increased bleeding times of at least 5 min; more than half of the untreated mice bled longer than a predetermined threshold of 20 min. The same level of bleeding was seen for those mice treated with PEG -NPs, whereas those treated with PNPs had bleeding times that were consistent with the unchallenged group. The results of the bleeding time assay correlate with the post -challenge platelet counts for each group and demonstrate that the amount of platele ts retained in PNP -treated mice is sufficient to retain full hemostatic capabilities. This is in line with previous research that platelet counts need to decrease below a certain threshold in order to translate to increased bleeding times [27]. The treatment efficacy results here confirm the ability of PNPs to bind and neutralize pathological antibodies in circulatio n, thus preserving the function of healthy platelets. ITP is a hematological disorder characterized by a decreased number of circulating platelets, which generally manifests as an increased tendency to bleed as well as susceptibility to bruising. While thi s can generally affect quality of life, severe cases can have serious consequences, such as the induction of intracranial hemorrhaging that carries with it a high mortality rate [28, 29] . The thrombocytopenic condition is very often acute and, in most cases, patients spontaneously recover platelet levels within a short period time without any specific treatment [30]. However, a small proportion may develop chronic ITP, which usually occurs in adults and is characterized by persistence of significantly low 167 platelet counts for longer than 6 -12 months. Unfortunately fo r patients suffering from chronic ITP, the disease commonly occurs in response to an unknown stimulus [31], makin g effective treatment a difficult task for clinicians. Drugs that either modulate or distract the immune system are generally employed, including the use of corticosteroids or IVIg as frontline therapies [32]. Splenectomy is the approach often taken after failure of initial treatment and can lead to the restoration of the platelet counts to a normal level by removing the orga n responsible for both clearance of opsonized platelets and pathological antibody production [33]. The procedure, however, can be associated with infection, bleeding, hospitalization, and vascular complications [11, 12] . Moreover, a splenectomy is irreversible and can likely lead to long -term impairment of hematologic and immunological functions Figure 4.6: In vivo treatment of antibody -induced thrombocytopenia by PNPs. Mice were intraperitoneally administered with anti -platelet antibodies, followed 15 min later by intravenous injections of either blank solution, PNPs, or PEG -NPs via the tail vein. (A) Blood was collected both before and 24 h after administration to quantify p latelet counts (n = 8; mean \u00b1 SEM). (B) Bleeding time from the tail vein into PBS. An upper time limit of 20 min was established prior to initiation of the study. ***P < 0.001, Student's t-test. 168 [12, 34] . Other secondary or tertiary treatment options exist, includ ing use of cytotoxic drugs, platelet transfusions, and thrombopoietin receptor agonists among others. To our knowledge, none of the current available therapies directly address the pathological moieties that contribute directly to the clearance of healthy platelets from circulation. To create a platform capable of specific autoantibody depletion for the treatment of ITP, platelet membrane was directly employed in order to fabricate nanoparticles that mimic the surface properties of the original cell [17, 22] . One major advantage of this approach is that the nanoparticle surface serves as a natural substrate for autoantibodies against endogenous cellular targets [35]. Further, the nanoparticles present the relevant epitopic targets recognized by the antibodies without the need to identify antigen specificity, which can vary among patients [36]. Cell membrane -coated nanoparticles have previously demonstrated favorable safety profiles in vivo as well as lack of both acute and chronic anti -nanoparticle immune responses [19, 37] . Another advantage of the nanoparticulate platform is that storage after lyophiliz ation is common practice [24], significantly extending shelf -life compared with whole platelets, which need to be carefully processed and expire within a week after collection [38]. In the present study, i n vitro binding of PNPs to anti-platelet antibodies was demonstrated to be both stable and specific. According to the information obtained from Figure 4.3A, the apparent weight binding ratio between PNPs and the anti - thrombocyte antibody was approximately 1:5. However, the antibody preparation 169 that we employed was polyclonal, and only about 15% of the antibody was actually specific to platelet membrane. Based on the information from these two pieces of data, we calculated that one PNP could sequester around 280 platelet membrane specific anti -thrombocyte antibodies. Pre -incubation and binding of antibodies to the nanoparticles appeared to preclude further interaction with platelets, a result that was confirmed in vivo. Impressively, the PNPs performed well in a competitive setting. A s shown in Figures 4.4 C and D, 20 g of PNPs, which contain 20 g of platelet membrane material, was able to reduce binding of antibodies to platelets by half, despite the fact that they were in the presence of 40 g worth of membrane material from the na tive platelets. This suggests that nanoparticulate membrane may have an inherent advantage in binding that can be exploited for other biodetoxification applications. Administration of PNPs in a therapeutic scenario demonstrated considerable efficacy, and a bleeding time assay was used to highlight the importance of preserving platelet counts. Compared with a 93% drop in platelet count for the PEG -NP treatment group, PNPs preserved 70% of the platelets, presumably due to their ability to bind the pathologica l antibodies and remove them from circulation. The results are not likely due to any thrombotic effect from the PNPs, as it has been demonstrated that the particles are absent most intracellular activating factors. Given the relative scarcity of platelets in the blood, it should be feasible to administer enough nanoparticles to significantly outnumber healthy circulating platelets. While the long -term consequences of administering cell membrane -derived antigenic material in a nanoparticulate format have yet to 170 be fully explored, it should be noted that platelet transfusion is a well -established clinical procedure; it can be reasonably expected that administration of membrane material only should be less burdensome given the lack of the biologically active components present in the intracellular compartment of intact platelets. 4.4 Conclusion In conclusion, we have successfully demonstrated the application of PNPs towards the treatment of ITP. The nanoparticles showed the ability to specifically bind anti-platelet autoantibodies, which are directly responsible for reducing platelet counts. Upon binding, it was demonstrated that the interaction between the PNPs and the antibodies was strong, effectively neutralizing biological activity in vivo. In an an tibody -induced thrombocytopenia animal model, mice treated with PNPs after challenge with antibodies were able to retain their platelet counts. Further, in a bleeding time assay, mice treated with PNPs exhibited normal hemostasis via effective clot formati on, and average values were nearly identical to unchallenged controls. On the other hand, untreated mice or those administered with control nanoparticles bled excessively due to lowered platelets counts and impaired hemostasis capacity. The ability to spec ifically neutralize anti -platelet antibodies in ITP presents a new option in the current landscape of treatment for the disease. Currently, most therapies are non -specific and can significantly impair broad immune function. By targeting the pathological an tibodies directly, it may be 171 possible to treat the disease while leaving the immunity intact, giving patients an increased opportunity for natural recovery of platelet counts without damaging and irreversible interventions. Alternatively, PNPs may also be used as an adjuvant therapy to either synergize with current treatments or enable a decrease in drug dosages to help limit unwanted side effects. Ultimately, PNPs represent a promising platform for the treatment of ITP and further study towards translation is warranted.

The nanovaccine was rationally designed to prese nt the two major components, the tumor antigens and the adjuvant , in a way that enhances their ability to promote efficient antigen presentation and activation of downstream immune responses. The formulation takes advantage of the small size of nanoparticles for lymphatic drainage and uptake into antigen presenting cel ls, and the endosomal uptake route was complemented by choosing an adjuvant with an endosomal receptor. Further, the cancer cell membrane coating allows for the delivery of multiple tumor antigens to drive a multi -antigenic immune response as a strategy to overcome the tumor heterogeneity that is often responsible for partial treatment responses or recurrence . Ultimately, it is demonstrated that the nanovaccine can elicit potent antitumor immune responses in vivo , including dendritic cell maturation and T c ell expansion . When combined with additional immunotherapies such as checkpoint blockades, the formulation demonstrates substantial therapeutic effect. Overall, the work exemplifies using nano -immunoengineering to create a novel anticancer vaccine that can later be extrapolated for the development of personalized, autologous anticancer vaccines with broad applicability. 178 5.2 Development of Red Blood Cell Membrane -Coated Nanoparticles as \"N anotoxoid\" Antivirulence -coated nanoparticles (RBCNP or \"nanotoxoid\") have great potential as a nanotoxoid vaccine by improving the deactivation and delivery of pore forming toxins for effective antivirulence immune responses . By mimicking the surface of red blood cells , the RBCNP serve s as a decoy to absorb pore-forming toxins that are commonly secreted by pathogenic bacteria as a mechanism to cause cellular damage and increase virulence . Within the nanotoxoid formulation, the toxins are detained to reduce damage to the h ost while also being presented to the immune system in an undenatured form as antigens In the chapter's first example, the efficacy of a biomimetic nanoparticle - based anti virulence vaccine is examined in a mouse model of methicillin - resistant Staphylococ cus aureus (MRSA) skin infection. Vaccination with nanoparticle -detained staphylococcal -hemolysin (Hla) caused strong in vivo immune responses including germinal center formation and high anti -Hla serum titers. This immune response provided protection against MRSA skin infection through both reduced lesion size and reduced bacterial load. This concept was then extended in the second example of the chapter by using MRSA supernatant, which contains a multitude of the nanotoxoid ( this in situ strategy, a multiantigenic nanotoxoid was made to improve vaccine potency by introducing a breadth of antigenic targets for more complete immunity formation. Compared to 179 a traditional anti -toxin vaccination consisting of heat -denatured MRSA supernatant, the nanotoxoid (hSP) caused the formation of higher anti -toxin titers for multiple different toxins. The improved immune response led to superior protection in b oth a MRSA skin infection model and an intravenous model. Importantly, no significant damage was caused by the nanotoxoid in vitro or in vivo . Overall, both examples show the utility of using the red blood cell membrane - coated nanoparticle for concurrent en trapment of toxins as the antigenic vaccine component in a manner that is both safe and highly immunogenic. Notably, this novel vaccination system is a way to combat bacteria without the use of antibiotics, which is important when antibiotic resistance is an increasing global concern. 180 5.3 Platelet Membrane -Coated Nanoparticles as \"Nanosponges\" for Autoantibody Clearance In the fourth chapter, platelet membrane -coated nanoparticles are used as cause a reduction in platelet counts that can lead to uncontrolled bleeding which can be fatal . In the study, the use of platelet membrane -coated nanoparticles (PNPs) is explored as a therapy to specifically clear anti -platelet antibodies. The platelet membrane coating confers the nanoparticles with a n outer surface displaying the full array of native platelet surface protein. In this way, it acts as a decoy to strongly bind the pathological antibodies that are specific to the platelet surface proteins. The ability of the nanoparticles to neutralize th e autoantibody activity was shown both in vitro and in vivo. Ultimately, we leverage the antibody binding of PNPs to therapeutically treat a mouse model of antibody -induced thrombocytopenia . Treatment with the PNPs was efficacious in reducing antibody -medi ated destruction of actual platelets, which allow for reduced bleeding in a bleeding time assay. The platelet membrane -coated nanoparticles exemplify a promising platform for specific ally treating antibody -mediated immune thrombocytopenia by acting as a decoy for anti -platelet antibodies and preserving circulating platelets w hile leaving general immune function s intact. This plat form can also potentially be expanded to address other autoimmune disorders that involve autoantibodies against specific host cells. "}
