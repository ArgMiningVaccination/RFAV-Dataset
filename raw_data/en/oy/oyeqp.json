Learn how to make and enjoy healthy food that helps you feel energized and nourished. Clean eating is about feeling your best and not feeling deprived! Basics of Clean Eating Before we dive in, let's do a review of what clean eating means. There is not one standard definition of clean eating. I define a clean eating diet as one that focuses one eating real, whole foods the majority of the time and choosing organic and sustainable options whenever possible. Clean eating also includes being an advocate for your own health and choosing the whole foods that work best for you and your body. Since we all have to eat several times a day, eating clean also means knowing how to plan for and prepare healthy meals. Learn more about the [basics of what is clean eating](https://www.cleaneatingkitchen.com/about/what-is-clean-eating/). Is Clean Eating a Diet? I think of clean eating as more of a choice and a lifestyle than a diet. There are no strict rules and the implied goal is better health and increased energy, as opposed to just losing weight. So, I think you could argue that clean eating is not a diet, but more of a healthy way of living. I'm a huge advocate of eating healthy without starving yourself. You might know that I have a [history of eating disorders](https://www.cleaneatingkitchen.com/my-journey-clean-eating-health/), so it's important for me to promote a balanced approach. I'm not against using specialized diets to address health issues, but I think it's important to make sure it doesn't get out of control. If you have health issues that you are trying to address with diet, then you might like this article about the [differences between keto, low-carb, vegan, paleo, and clean eating diets](https://www.cleaneatingkitchen.com/paleo-keto-whole30-vegan-diets/). And, yes, you can use clean eating to aid in balanced and healthy weight loss. See my article on [clean eating for weight loss](https://www.cleaneatingkitchen.com/clean-eating-for-weight-loss/). But, if your diet starts to interfere with your relationships or social life, then it's time to take a step back and make sure your relationship with food is still healthy. You may also want to read more about the [dangers of fasting for women](https://www.cleaneatingkitchen.com/dangers-intermittent-fasting-women/). Simply put, our bodies were designed to eat whole vegetable and animal foods throughout the day for nourishment. What If I Don't Know How to Cook? If you're new to cooking or you don't have any idea of how to cook healthy, then you're in the right place! I didn't even know how to boil a water until I was 30 years old (no joke), so this clean eating diet guide is perfect for you. Learn more [about me](https://www.cleaneatingkitchen.com/about/). If you know how to cook but you just want to clean up your technique (no pun intended), then you're also in the right place. My meal planning guide plus cooking tips included in this blog post can help you make healthy food fast. See my related article on the [best kitchen appliances for clean eating](https://www.cleaneatingkitchen.com/best-kitchen-appliances-for-healthy-eating/). What Should I Eat At Each Meal? Generally, most people find that they need around three meals per day, plus a snack. Again, this depends on your unique needs. If you eat enough balanced foods at each meal, three meals and a snack is sufficient for most people. Keep reading to learn more about how you can structure each meal and how to eat clean. See my related list of the [10 healthiest foods to eat every day](https://www.cleaneatingkitchen.com/what-foods-to-eat-everyday/). Is Clean Eating Expensive? Many people are concerned that it's going to be hugely expensive to eat clean. While you can easily overspend on healthy foods, you don't have to! As someone who lived on a very small budget for many years, I have some tips on [how to eat clean on a budget](https://www.cleaneatingkitchen.com/how-to-eat-clean-on-a-budget-tips-meal-plan/). So, while clean eating might be more expensive than eating at fast food restaurants, overall it is going to be less expensive since you will likely have fewer disease-related expenses over time. Think of clean eating as a long-term investment in your health! By committing to the healthy eating habit, you will be less likely to get heart disease, be obese, or have high blood pressure. Even small changes can have a big positive impact. Clean Eating Food Ideas Let's get into some specifics about how to eat clean at each meal. You can also see my full [clean eating shopping list and pantry guide](https://www.cleaneatingkitchen.com/clean-eating-food-list/) if you are ready to go shopping. Again, think of clean eating as an outline rather than a specific diet. You have the whole array of whole, natural foods to start with, and then you can build your meals around a general outline of protein, carbs, and healthy fats. Choose your breakfast, lunch and dinner recipes based around the foods that you like or enjoy. Or, better yet, choose what is in season and available at your local grocery store or farmers' market within your personal budget. Clean foods are ones that are in their natural state without too much processing. Think of foods like fresh fruits, lean proteins, healthy fats, leafy greens and other vegetables, and whole grains. Processed foods would be white bread, cookies, fruit juices with added sugars, candies, and other packaged foods. Healthy Breakfast Ideas Most people need a quick, healthy meal to get them started on the right foot. It's [especially important for women](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/04/140429162110.htm) to start the day with an adequate amount of protein. Including plenty of healthy fats and a generous serving of protein can keep blood sugar stable and help you feel satiated. Foods like green protein smoothies, porridge, toasts, chia puddings, overnight oats, or savory meals like eggs and sausage can often be prepared in advance or quickly cooked. See all of my [clean eating breakfast recipes](https://www.cleaneatingkitchen.com/category/breakfast/). You can also check out my lists of [healthy breakfast ideas for kids](https://www.cleaneatingkitchen.com/healthy-breakfast-ideas-for-kids/) or my [clean eating breakfast ideas](https://www.cleaneatingkitchen.com/healthy-breakfast-ideas-for-school-quick-easy/). Healthy Lunch Ideas Lunch should arguably be your biggest meal, since you'll need the energy to power you through the rest of your day. Focus on lots of healthy fats and protein, plus some energy-dense carbs. Good clean eating lunch options include loaded salads, pastas, beans, soups, and wraps or sandwiches. If you tend to go out to eat during your lunch break, start a new habit of going home for lunch or bringing your own to the office. Check out my article on [meal prep ideas for busy people](https://www.cleaneatingkitchen.com/ten-meal-prep-ideas/) or see this list of the [best clean eating recipes](https://www.cleaneatingkitchen.com/clean-eating-recipes-easy/). Healthy Snacks Snacks should help you fuel between meals, usually between long stretches like lunch and dinner. Snacks are usually lighter than meals and should focus on healthy fats and protein. Don't fall victim to processed foods or junk foods if you get hungry between meals. Prepare and cook your snacks just like you would your meals. Things like homemade jerkies, chia puddings, nuts, nut butters, veggies, fruits, smoothies, crackers, and raw veggie breads are great for a mid-day fuel source. See my full list of [gluten-free and dairy-free snacks.](https://www.cleaneatingkitchen.com/best-gluten-free-and-dairy-free-snacks/) Healthy Dinner Ideas Fueling your body for sleep is just as important as fueling yourself for activity, since our bodies repair and restore themselves during sleep. Many people do well with complex carbohydrates at dinner, mixed with a source of protein and vegetables. Focus on red meat/poultry/fish, potatoes, gluten-free grains, vegetables, and healthy fats. This article from Dr. Lara Briden discusses why [women need a balanced dinner](https://www.larabriden.com/your-hormones-need-dinner/) for our hormones and health.

On a separate note, if you have low energy, you might be interested in my article on [reasons why you're always tired](https://www.cleaneatingkitchen.com/ten-reasons-why-always-tired/). How to Fill Your Clean Eating Plate Still unsure of what your clean eating plate should look like? A good rule of thumb is to fill half your plate with veggies, \u00bc with protein, and \u00bc with complex carbs. Read more about [how to fill a healthy plate](https://www.cleaneatingkitchen.com/what-foods-to-eat-everyday/) and which foods you should be eating every day. Adding 1-2 tablespoons of a healthy fat per meal is also a good idea. Healthy fats like avocado, coconut, ghee, grass-fed butter, nuts, and seeds provide important nutrients and also help you absorb other vitamins, minerals, and phytonutrients. For dessert, enjoy fresh fruit or a healthy homemade baked treat (see all of my [clean eating dessert recipes](https://www.cleaneatingkitchen.com/category/recipe-dessert/)). Clean Eating Diet Food List Here are some tips for filling your kitchen with an abundance of clean eating, whole foods. Rather than browsing each aisle of the store when you're trying to eat clean, focus on the outer aisles where you'll find the produce and protein options. Venture into the inner aisles for pantry staples, and ignore the processed snacks and box dinners. Your clean eating shopping list should include the ingredients below, adjusted and/or expanded to your unique needs. For instance, you may need to adapt your meal plan to avoid the [worst foods for Hashimoto's](https://www.cleaneatingkitchen.com/worst-foods-for-hashimotos/).

Proteins - Ground beef/bison, steak, chicken, ground turkey, lamb, pork, fish, sausage - Clean, whole food protein powder and/or collagen peptides - TIP: buy your meat/fish frozen or in bulk from a local farmer or a quality source Carbohydrates - Sweet potatoes, white potatoes, fruits/veggies, legumes, gluten-free grains - TIP: frozen fruits/veggies are usually more affordable and reduce food waste. Buy grains and legumes in bulk and store in your pantry - See my full list of the [best gluten-free carbs](https://www.cleaneatingkitchen.com/best-gluten-free-carbohydrate-sources/).

Healthy Cooking Techniques Feeling comfortable in the kitchen is an essential part of learning how to eat clean. There are many different cooking techniques you can master to help make preparation easier and completely transform your ingredients. Here are some great clean eating cooking techniques to make the process easier and more efficient. See my full list of the [best clean eating kitchen appliances](https://www.cleaneatingkitchen.com/best-kitchen-appliances-for-healthy-eating/). 1. Slow Cooker (Crockpot) For the easiest meals ever, invest in a slow cooker! Also commonly referred to by the brand name Crockpot, slow cookers are best for multiple-serving meals. I have a [6-quart slow-cooker](https://amzn.to/2WOCrgo). You can put in all of your ingredients, set the slow cooker to low or high (and time, if yours has a timer), and it will slowly cook your meal over the course of several hours. You can even have it cook overnight and set it to warm in the morning to have for that night, or cook it all day and have it ready for when you come home from work. Slow cookers are notorious for making food extra flavorful and tender. See my [clean eating slow cooker recipes](https://www.cleaneatingkitchen.com/category/slow-cooker/). 2. Pressure Cooker These are also commonly referred to by a brand name, Instant Pot. Pressure cookers are like slow cookers, just sped up! They use a sealed pot to create pressure and steam to cook the food. I recommend a [6-quart Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/2TBnlIT) for most people. See my [beginner's guide to the Instant Pot Duo](https://www.cleaneatingkitchen.com/how-to-use-instant-pot-recipes/). Add all your ingredients, set a time and cook setting, and the pressure cooker does the work for you. Use this for quick meals and tender meats. See all of my [Instant Pot recipes](https://www.cleaneatingkitchen.com/category/pressure-cooker/instant-pot-recipes/). 3. Casseroles & One-Pot Meals When you want to get a lot of veggies or ingredients in one dish, consider going for casserole or one-pot recipes. Soups are also a great option for a quick, low-fuss meal that can yield several servings. Here is a lift of my favorite [healthy casseroles](https://www.cleaneatingkitchen.com/category/casseroles/). 4. Sheet Pan Meals Sheet pan meals are another version of a one-pot meal. With sheet pan meals, you can arrange all your ingredients on a metal sheet pan and let them all bake/roast together. You don't really need a recipe for these, unless you want one! Simply toss your favorite veggies and a cut of meat with cooking oil and spices and pop in the oven, checking and turning once or twice. Most sheet pan meals need about 30 minutes at 425 degrees. 5. All-in-One Cooking Appliance Hands down, the most common complaint I get about cooking at home is the lack of time. If that's the case with you, you might consider an \"all-in-one cooking appliance.\" These types of devices are becoming more common and easy to use. The brand I have is called [Multo by CookingPal](https://www.cookingpal.com/CleanEatingKitchen) (read my [full review of the Multo](https://www.cleaneatingkitchen.com/multo-appliance-review/)). If you enjoy using the power of technology in the kitchen, then you should definitely consider this type of device! The Multo is also great because it comes loaded with an extensive library of healthy recipes. 6. Grilling This method is most commonly used for meat, since it imparts food with a distinct flavor from the smoke and charcoal. It's a relatively quick cooking method as well. I like to reserve grilling for the warm summer months, but indoor grills are an option too. Don't limit your grilling to just meats; veggies and tropical fruits are also delicious grilled. 7. Cast iron skillet Cooking with a cast iron is a fantastic way to impart your food with an important nutrient. Well-seasoned cast iron skillets are essentially non-stick without toxic coatings and can last for generations. They hold and distribute heat very well, so food cooks evenly. Cooking in a cast iron skillet gives food a wonderful texture and easy clean up. Cooking in cast iron can also help improve iron levels which can be important for women of child-bearing age. Learn more about the [healthiest cookware options](https://www.cleaneatingkitchen.com/what-is-the-safest-cookware/). Here's a [pre-seasoned cast iron skillet](https://amzn.to/2t9k3RD) to help get you started. 8. Air Fryer Air frying has taken off in recent years! For good reason, as air frying is essentially like using a mini convection oven. Read more about the [pros and cons of air frying](https://www.cleaneatingkitchen.com/air-fryer-pros-and-cons/). It is efficient, fast, and you can cook almost anything including meats, vegetables, and even dessert (check out my recipe for [Air Fryer Bananas](https://www.cleaneatingkitchen.com/air-fryer-bananas/)). Quality air fryer don't have to be expensive, either. Choose from my list to find the [best air fryers under $100](https://www.cleaneatingkitchen.com/best-air-fryers-under-100/) if you're looking to buy one.
