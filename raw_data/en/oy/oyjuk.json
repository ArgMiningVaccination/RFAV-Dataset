SENSE OF CONGRESS. 7 (a) F INDINGS .\u2014Congress finds the following: 8 (1) According to the National Survey on Drug 9 Use and Health, in 2015, there were approximately 10 9,800,000 adults in the United States with serious 11 mental illness. 12 (2) The Substance Abuse and Mental Health 13 Services Administration defines the term ''serious 14 mental illness'' as an illness affecting individuals 18 15 years of age or older as having, at any time in the 16 past year, a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emo- 17 tional disorder that results in serious functional im- 18 pairment and substantially interferes with or limits 19 one or more major life activities. 20 (3) In reporting on the incidence of serious 21 mental illness, the Substance Abuse and Mental 22 Health Services Administration includes major de- 23 pression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and other 24 mental disorders that cause serious impairment. 25 VerDate Nov 24 2008 15:02 Nov 25, 634 (4) Adults with a serious mental illness are at 1 a higher risk for chronic physical illnesses and pre- 2 mature death. 3 (5) According to the World Health Organiza- 4 tion, adults with a serious mental illness have life- 5 spans that are 10 to 25 years shorter than those 6 without serious mental illness. The vast majority of 7 these deaths are due to chronic physical medical con- 8 ditions, such as cardiovascular, respiratory, and in- 9 fectious diseases, as well as diabetes and hyper- 10 tension. 11 (6) According to the World Health Organiza- 12 tion, the majority of deaths of adults with a serious 13 mental illness that are due to physical medical con- 14 ditions are preventable. 15 (7) Supported decision making can facilitate 16 care decisions in areas where serious mental illness 17 may impact the capacity of an individual to deter- 18 mine a course of treatment while still allowing the 19 individual to make decisions independently. 20 (8) Help should be provided to adults with a se- 21 rious mental illness to address their acute or chronic 22 physical illnesses, make informed choices about 23 treatment, and understand and follow through with 24 appropriate treatment. 25 VerDate Nov 24 2008 15:02 Nov 25, 635 (9) There is confusion in the health care com- 1 munity regarding permissible practices under the 2 regulations promulgated under the Health Insurance 3 Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (com- 4 monly known as ''HIPAA''). This confusion may 5 hinder appropriate communication of health care in- 6 formation or treatment preferences with appropriate 7 caregivers. 8 (b) S ENSE OF CONGRESS .\u2014It is the sense of Con- 9 gress that clarification is needed regarding the privacy 10 rule promulgated under section 264(c) of the Health In-11 surance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (42 12 U.S.C. 1320d-2 note) regarding existing permitted uses 13 and disclosures of health information by health care pro-14 fessionals to communicate with caregivers of adults with 15 a serious mental illness to facilitate treatment. 16 SEC. 11002.
