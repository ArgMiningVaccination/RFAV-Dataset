What is mind-body therapy? According to the U.S. [National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health](https://nccih.nih.gov/), mind-body therapies and practices include \"behavioural, psychological, social, expressive, and spiritual approaches\" to healthcare. Or, as described by the University of Maryland Medical Center, mind-body medicine \"uses the power of thoughts and emotions to influence physical health. As Hippocrates once wrote, 'The natural healing force within each one of us is the greatest force in getting well.' This is mind-body medicine in a nutshell.\" Some techniques that are considered mind-body therapies or practices include: - Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) - Biofeedback - Meditation - Spirituality and prayer - Hypnosis - Relaxation through: - Creative arts therapies (art, music, or dance) - Yoga - Tai chi - Guided imagery Why is mind-body therapy so popular? Mind-Body therapies are often used alongside conventional or Western medicine to help relax a patient, improve the ability to cope in stressful situations, reduce tension and pain, and, in many cases, reduce the need for medication. According to NHS Direct, stress is not a disease in itself, but it can cause serious illness if it's not addressed. Mental health issues, including stress, anxiety and depression, are the reason for one-in-five visits to a family doctor. Mind-body therapies are becoming more mainstream and viewed more as complementary rather than a quacky alternative. Is the field of mind-body therapy a growing one? A survey commissioned by the Regus Group, suggests workplace stress is on the increase, with six in 10 workers in major economies experiencing increased stress over the last two years. That, alongside anecdotal results of the effect of mind-body therapies on chronic illnesses such as cancer, would indicate that a career in mind-body therapies might be one that is in ever-increasing demand. Training Every type of mind-body therapy has some form of training, whether that results in a diploma, degree, or certification. A yoga instructor would need to complete a certificate programme whereas a Creative Arts Therapist would most likely be required to take a degree in their subject. There are many centres of excellence that teach several types of therapies requiring certification, such as the Chopra Centre, and several universities that teach degree courses. The best course of action in order to choose a course that is recognised is to contact the association or institute that oversees the field that you are interested in. It's important to be aware of online courses that don't deliver what they appear to offer. ********************************************************************************************************************* Are you looking for a new job or career?
