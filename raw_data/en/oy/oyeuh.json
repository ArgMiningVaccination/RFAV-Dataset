There are 2 main ways to get Medicare: Original Medicare Original Medicare includes Medicare Part A (Hospital Insurance) and Part B (Medical Insurance). You can join a separate Medicare drug plan to get Medicare drug coverage (Part D). You can use any doctor or hospital that takes Medicare, anywhere in the U.S. To help pay your out-of-pocket costs in Original Medicare (like your 20% coinsurance ), you can also shop for and buy supplemental coverage.Medicare Advantage (also known as Part C) Medicare Advantage is a Medicare-approved plan from a private company that offers an alternative to Original Medicare for your health and drug coverage. These \"bundled\" plans include Part A, Part B, and usually Part D. In most cases, you'll need to use doctors who are in the plan's network. Plans may have lower out-of-pocket costs than Original Medicare. Plans may offer some extra benefits that Original Medicare doesn't cover\u2014like vision, hearing, and dental services. Part A Part B You can add: Part D You can also add: Supplemental coverage This includes Medicare Supplement Insurance (Medigap ). See Section 5 (starting on page 75 ) to learn more about Medigap. Or, you can use coverage from a former employer or union, or Medicaid . Part A Part B Most plans include: Part D Some extra benefits Some plans also include: Lower out-of-pocket costs See Section 3 (starting on page 57 ) to learn more about Original Medicare.See Section 4 (starting on page 61 ) to learn more about Medicare Advantage.66 AT A GLANCE Original Medicare vs. Medicare Advantage Doctor & hospital choice Original Medicare Medicare Advantage (Part C) You can go to any doctor or hospital that takes Medicare, anywhere in the U.S.In many cases, you'll need to only use doctors and other providers who are in the plan's network (for non-emergency care). Some plans offer non-emergency coverage out of network, but typically at a higher cost. In most cases, you don't need a referral to see a specialist.You may need to get a referral to see a specialist. Cost Original Medicare Medicare Advantage (Part C) For Part B-covered services, you usually pay 20% of the Medicare-approved amount after you meet your deductible . This is called your coinsurance . Out-of-pocket costs vary \u2014plans may have different out-of-pocket costs for certain services. You pay a premium (monthly payment) for Part B . If you choose to join a Medicare drug plan, you'll pay a separate premium for your Medicare drug coverage (Part D). You pay the monthly Part B premium and may also have to pay the plan's premium . Plans may have a $0 premium and may help pay all or part of your Part B premium. Most plans include Medicare drug coverage (Part D). There's no yearly limit on what you pay out of pocket, unless you have supplemental coverage\u2014like Medicare Supplement Insurance ( Medigap ).Plans have a yearly limit on what you pay out of pocket for services Medicare Part A and Part B covers. Once you reach your plan's limit, you'll pay nothing for services Part A and Part B covers for the rest of the year. You can get Medigap to help pay your remaining out-of-pocket costs (like your 20% coinsurance). Or, you can use coverage from a former employer or union, or Medicaid .You can't buy and don't need Medigap. 77 Coverage Original Medicare Medicare Advantage (Part C) Original Medicare covers most medically necessary services and supplies in hospitals, doctors' offices, and other health care facilities. Original Medicare doesn't cover some benefits like eye exams, most dental care, and routine exams. S ee page 55 .Plans must cover all of the medically necessary services that Original Medicare covers. Most plans offer some extra benefits that Original Medicare doesn't cover \u2014like some routine exams and vision, hearing, and dental services. You can join a separate Medicare drug plan to get Medicare drug coverage (Part D).Medicare drug coverage (Part D) is included in most plans. In most types of Medicare Advantage Plans , you can't join a separate Medicare drug plan. In most cases, you don't have to get a service or supply approved ahead of time for Original Medicare to cover it.In some cases, you have to get a service or supply approved ahead of time for the plan to cover it. Foreign travel Original Medicare Medicare Advantage (Part C) Original Medicare generally doesn't cover care outside the U.S. You may be able to buy a Medicare Supplement Insurance (Medigap) policy that covers emergency care outside the U.S.Plans generally don't cover care outside the U.S. Some plans may offer a supplemental benefit that covers emergency and urgently needed services when traveling outside the U.S. This book explains these topics in more detail: Original Medicare: See Section 3 (starting on page 57 ).

SECTION 1 Signing up for Medicare Will I get Part A and Part B automatically? If you're already getting benefits from Social Security or the Railroad Retirement Board (RRB), you'll automatically get Part A and Part B starting the first day of the month you turn 65. (If your birthday is on the first day of the month, Part A and Part B will start the first day of the prior month.) If you're under 65 and have a disability, you'll automatically get Part A and Part B after you get disability benefits from Social Security or certain disability benefits from the RRB for 24 months. If you live in Puerto Rico, you don't automatically get Part B. You must sign up for it. See page 16 . If you have ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also called Lou Gehrig's disease), you'll get Part A and Part B automatically the month your Social Security disability benefits begin. If you're automatically enrolled, you'll get your red, white, and blue Medicare card in the mail 3 months before your 65th birthday or 25th month of disability benefits, and you don't need to pay a premium for Part A (sometimes called \"premium-free Part A\"). Most people choose to keep Part B. If you don't want Part B, let us know before the coverage start date on your Medicare card. If you do nothing, you'll keep Part B and will have to pay Part B premiums through your Social Security benefits. If you choose not to keep Part B but decide you want it later, you may have to wait to enroll and pay a penalty for as long as you have Part B. See page 23 . If you need to get a replacement Medicare card because it's damaged or lost, log into (or create) your secure Medicare account at Medicare.gov to print or order an official copy of your Medicare card. You can also use this account to manage your personal and other coverage information (like your drug list and claims status). See page 110 for more information about Medicare.gov . You can also call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227) to get a replacement card. TTY users can call 1-877-486-2048. If you need to replace your card because you think that someone else is using your Medicare Number, call 1-800-MEDICARE. 16 SECTION 1: Signing up for Medicare16 Will I have to enroll in Part A and/or Part B? If you're close to 65, but NOT getting Social Security or Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) benefits, you'll need to enroll in Medicare. Visit socialsecurity.gov/benefits/medicare to apply for Part A and Part B. You can also contact Social Security 3 months before you turn 65 to set up an appointment. If you worked for a railroad, contact the RRB. In most cases, if you don't sign up for Part B when you're first eligible, you may have a delay in getting Medicare Part B coverage in the future (in some cases over a year), and you may have to pay a late enrollment penalty for as long as you have Part B. See page 23 . If you have End-Stage Renal Disease ( ESRD) and you want Medicare, you'll need to enroll. Contact Social Security to find out when and how to enroll in Part A and Part B. For more information, visit Medicare.gov/publications to view the booklet, \"Medicare Coverage of Kidney Dialysis & Kidney Transplant Services.\" If you live in Puerto Rico and get benefits from Social Security or the RRB, you'll automatically get Part A the first day of the month you turn 65 or after you get disability benefits for 24 months. However, if you want Part B, you'll need to sign up for it by completing an \"Application for Enrollment in Part B Form\" (CMS-40B). Visit Medicare.gov/forms-help-resources/medicare-forms to get Form CMS-40B in English or Spanish. If you don't sign up for Part B when you're first eligible, you may have to pay a late enrollment penalty for as long as you have Part B. See page 23 . Where can I get more information? Call Social Security at 1-800-772-1213 for more information about your Medicare eligibility and to enroll in Part A and/or Part B. TTY users can call 1-800-325-0778. If you worked for a railroad or get RRB benefits, call the RRB at 1-877-772-5772. TTY users can call 1-312-751-4701. You can also get free, personalized health insurance counseling from your State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP). See pages 117-120 for the phone number. Once you're enrolled in Medicare, it's time to look at your coverage options. People get coverage in different ways. To get the most out of your coverage, review all of your Medicare coverage options and find what best meets your needs. See pages 6-8 for more information. Important!17 SECTION 1: Signing up for Medicare17 If I didn't get enrolled in Part A and Part B automatically, when can I enroll? If you didn't get automatically enrolled in premium-free Part A (for example, because you're still working and not yet getting Social Security or Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) benefits), you can sign up for premium-free Part A (if you're eligible) any time during or after your Initial Enrollment Period begins. See page 22 for more information. If you're eligible for premium-free Part A, you can enroll in Part A any time after you're first eligible for Medicare. Your Part A coverage will go back (retroactively) 6 months from when you enroll, but no earlier than the first month you're eligible for Medicare. You can only sign up for Part B during the periods listed below. Remember, in most cases, if you don't enroll in Part A (if you have to buy it) and Part B when you're first eligible, your enrollment may be delayed and you may have to pay a late enrollment penalty. See pages 22-23 . What are the Part A and Part B enrollment periods? You can only enroll in Part B (and/or Part A if you have to buy it) during these enrollment periods. Initial Enrollment Period You can first sign up for Part A and/or Part B during the 7-month period that begins 3 months before the month you turn 65, includes the month you turn 65, and ends 3 months after the month you turn 65. If you enroll in Part A and/or Part B during the first 3 months of your Initial Enrollment Period, in most cases, your coverage begins the first day of your birthday month. However, if your birthday is on the first day of the month, your coverage will start the first day of the prior month. If you enroll in and are paying for Part A and/or Part B the month you turn 65 or during the last 3 months of your Initial Enrollment Period, the start date for your Part B coverage will be delayed. Special Enrollment Period After your Initial Enrollment Period is over, you may have a chance to enroll in Medicare during a Special Enrollment Period. If you didn't sign up for Part B (or Part A if you have to buy it) when you were first eligible because you have group health plan coverage based on current employment (your own, a spouse's, or a family member's\u2014if you have a disability), you can enroll in Part A and/or Part B: Anytime you're still covered by the group health plan During the 8-month period that begins the month after the employment ends or the coverage ends, whichever happens first Important!18 SECTION 1: Signing up for Medicare18 Usually, you don't pay a late enrollment penalty if you sign up during a Special Enrollment Period. This period doesn't apply if you're eligible for Medicare based on End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), or you're still in your Initial Enrollment Period. Note: If you have a disability, and the group health plan coverage is based on a family member's current employment (other than a spouse), the employer offering the group health plan must have 100 or more employees for you to get a Special Enrollment Period. COBRA (Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act) coverage, retiree health plans, VA coverage, and individual health insurance coverage (like coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace\u00ae) aren't considered coverage based on current employment. There may be reasons why you should take Part B instead of, or in addition to, COBRA coverage. You aren't eligible for a Special Enrollment Period to sign up for Medicare when that COBRA coverage ends. To avoid paying a higher premium , make sure you enroll in Medicare when you're first eligible. Your current coverage may not pay for health services you get if you don't have both Part A and Part B. See page 88 for more information about COBRA coverage. General Enrollment Period If you have to pay for Part A but don't sign up for it and/or don't sign up for Part B (for which you must pay premiums) during your Initial Enrollment Period, and you don't qualify for a Special Enrollment Period, you can sign up during the General Enrollment Period between January 1-March 31 each year. Your coverage won't start until July 1 of that year, and you may have to pay a higher Part A and/or Part B premium for late enrollment. See pages 22-23 . If you aren't sure if you qualify for a Special Enrollment Period, or to learn more about enrollment periods, visit Medicare.gov or call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227). TTY users can call 1-877-486-2048. Important!19 SECTION 1: Signing up for Medicare19 I have other coverage. Should I get Part B? This information can help you decide if you should get Part B based on the type of health coverage you may have. Employer or union coverage If you or your spouse (or family member if you have a disability) are still working and you have health coverage through that employer or union, contact the employer or union benefits administrator to find out how your coverage works with Medicare (see page 21 ). This includes federal or state employment and active-duty military service. It might be to your advantage to delay Part B enrollment while you still have health coverage based on your or your spouse's current employment. Coverage based on current employment doesn't include: COBRA Retiree coverage VA coverage Individual health insurance coverage (like through the Health Insurance Marketplace\u00ae) TRICARE If you have TRICARE (health care program for active-duty and retired service members and their families), you generally must enroll in Part A and Part B when you're first eligible to keep your TRICARE coverage. However, if you're an active-duty service member or an active-duty family member, you don't have to enroll in Part B to keep your TRICARE coverage. For more information, contact TRICARE. See page 90. If you have CHAMPVA coverage, you must enroll in Part A and Part B to keep it. Call 1-800-733-8387 for more information about CHAMPVA. Medicaid If you have Medicaid and don't have Part B, Medicaid may help you enroll. Medicare will pay first, and Medicaid will pay second. Medicaid may be able to help pay your Medicare out-of-pocket costs (like premiums , deductibles , coinsurance , and copayments ). Call your State Medical Assistance (Medicaid) office for more information and to see if you qualify. Visit Medicare.gov/talk-to-someone , or call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227) to get the phone number for your state's Medicaid office. TTY users can call 1-877-486-2048.20 SECTION 1: Signing up for Medicare20 Health Insurance Marketplace\u00ae Even if you have Marketplace coverage, you should generally enroll in Medicare when you're first eligible to avoid the risk of a delay in Medicare coverage and the possibility of a Medicare late enrollment penalty. Here are some important points to consider if you have Marketplace coverage: You need to end your Marketplace coverage in a timely manner to avoid an overlap in coverage. Once you're considered eligible for or enrolled in Part A, you won't qualify for help from the Marketplace to pay your Marketplace plan premiums or other medical costs. If you continue to get help paying for your Marketplace plan premiums after you have Medicare, you may have to pay back some or all of the help you got when you file your federal income taxes. Visit HealthCare.gov to connect to the Marketplace in your state and learn more. To find out how to end your Marketplace plan or Marketplace savings when your Medicare coverage begins, visit HealthCare.gov/medicare/changing-from-marketplace-to-medicare . You can also call the Marketplace Call Center at 1-800-318-2596. TTY users can call 1-855-889-4325. Health Savings Account (HSA) You aren't eligible to make contributions to an HSA after you have Medicare. To avoid a tax penalty, you should make your last HSA contribution the month before your Part A coverage begins. Premium-free Part A coverage begins 6 months before the month you apply for Medicare, Social Security, or Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) benefits, but no earlier than the month you turn 65. If you apply for Medicare during your Initial Enrollment Period or during the 2 months after your Initial Enrollment Period ends, you should make your last HSA contribution the month before you turn 65. If you wait to enroll in Medicare less than 6 months after you turn 65, you can avoid a tax penalty by stopping HSA contributions the month before you turn 65. If you wait to enroll in Medicare 6 or more months after you turn 65, you can avoid a tax penalty by stopping HSA contributions 6 months before the month you apply for Medicare. Note: A Medicare Medical Savings Account (MSA) plan is similar to an HSA plan. See page 67 . For information on the Part B late enrollment penalty, see page 23 .21 SECTION 1: Signing up for Medicare21 How does my other insurance work with Medicare? When you have other insurance (like group health plan, retiree health, or Medicaid coverage) and Medicare, there are rules for whether Medicare or your other coverage pays first. If you have retiree health coverage (like insurance from your or your spouse's former employment)... Medicare pays first. If you're 65 or older, have group health plan coverage based on your or your spouse's current employment, and the employer has 20 or more employees ... Your group health plan pays first. If you're 65 or older, have group health plan coverage based on your or your spouse's current employment, and the employer has fewer than 20 employees ... Medicare pays first. If you're under 65 and have a disability, have group health plan coverage based on your or a family member's current employment, and the employer has 100 or more employees ... Your group health plan pays first. If you're under 65 and have a disability, have group health plan coverage based on your or a family member's current employment, and the employer has fewer than 100 employees ... Medicare pays first. If you have group health plan coverage based on your or a family member's employment or former employment, and you're eligible for Medicare because of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD)...Your group health plan pays first for the first 30 months after you become eligible to enroll in Medicare. Medicare pays first after this 30-month period. If you have Medicaid... Medicare pays first. If you're still working and have employer coverage through work, contact your employer to find out how your employer's coverage works with Medicare. Important!22 SECTION 1: Signing up for Medicare22 Here are some important facts to remember about how other insurance works with Medicare-covered services: The insurance that pays first (primary payer) pays up to the limits of its coverage. The insurance that pays second (secondary payer) only pays if there are costs the primary payer didn't cover. The secondary payer (which may be Medicare) might not pay all of the uncovered costs. If your group health plan or retiree health coverage is the secondary payer, you might need to enroll in Part B before your insurance will pay. Visit Medicare.gov/publications to view the booklet, \"Medicare and Other Health Benefits: Your Guide to Who Pays First.\" You can also call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227) for more information. TTY users can call 1-877-486-2048. If you have other insurance or changes to your insurance, you need to let Medicare know by calling Medicare's Benefits Coordination & Recovery Center at 1-855-798-2627. TTY users can call 1-855-797-2627. If you have Part A, you may get a \"Health Coverage\" form (IRS Form 1095-B) from Medicare. This form verifies that you had health coverage in the past year. Keep the form for your records. Not everyone will get this form. If you don't get Form 1095-B, don't worry, you don't need to have it to file your taxes. How much does Part A coverage cost? You usually don't pay a monthly premium for Part A coverage if you or your spouse paid Medicare taxes while working for a certain amount of time. This is sometimes called premium-free Part A. If you aren't eligible for premium-free Part A, you may be able to buy Part A. For more information on how to pay your Part A premium, see page 24 . If you buy Part A, you'll pay a premium of either $274 or up to $499 each month in 2022 depending on how long you or your spouse worked and paid Medicare taxes. If you think you need help paying your Part A premium, see pages 94-96 . In most cases, if you choose to buy Part A, you must also have Part B and pay monthly premiums for both. If you choose NOT to buy Part A, you can still buy Part B if you're eligible What's the Part A late enrollment penalty? If you aren't eligible for premium-free Part A, and you don't buy it when you're first eligible, your monthly premium may go up 10%. You'll have to pay the higher premium for twice the number of years you could have had Part A but didn't enroll. Example: If you were eligible for Part A for 2 years but didn't enroll, you'll have to pay a 10% higher premium for 4 years.Important!23 SECTION 1: Signing up for Medicare23 How much does Part B coverage cost? The standard Part B premium amount in 2022 is $170.10. Most people pay the standard Part B premium amount. If your modified adjusted gross income is above a certain amount, you may pay an Income Related Monthly Adjustment Amount (IRMAA). IRMAA is an extra charge added to your premium. To determine if you'll pay the IRMAA, Medicare uses the modified adjusted gross income reported on your IRS tax return from 2 years ago. Note: You may also pay an extra amount for your Medicare drug coverage (Part D) premium if your modified adjusted gross income is above a certain amount. See page 82 . If you have to pay an extra amount and you disagree (for example, your income is lower due to a life event), visit socialsecurity.gov or call Social Security at 1-800-772-1213. TTY users can call 1-800-325-0778. What's the Part B late enrollment penalty? If you don't sign up for Part B when you're first eligible, you may have to pay a late enrollment penalty for as long as you have Part B. Your monthly Part B premium may go up 10% for each full 12 months in the period that you could've had Part B, but didn't enroll. If you're allowed to sign up for Part B during a Special Enrollment Period, you usually don't pay a late enrollment penalty. See pages 17-18 . Example: Mr. Smith's Initial Enrollment Period ended December 2019. He waited to enroll in Part B until March 2022 during the General Enrollment Period. His coverage begins July 1, 2022. His Part B premium penalty is 20%, and he'll have to pay this penalty for as long as he has Part B. (Even though Mr. Smith wasn't covered a total of 27 months, this included only 2 full 12-month periods.) Cost & coverage: To learn how to get help with Medicare costs, see Section 7 (starting on page 91 ). How can I pay my Part B premium? If you get Social Security or Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) benefits, your Part B premium will be deducted from your benefit payment. If you're a federal retiree with an annuity from the Office of Personnel Management and not entitled to Social Security or RRB benefits, you may request to have your Part B premiums deducted from your annuity. Call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227) to make your request. TTY users can call 1-877-486-2048.Important!24 SECTION 1: Signing up for Medicare24 If you don't get these benefit payments, you'll get a bill. If you choose to buy Part A, you'll always get a monthly bill for your premium . There are 4 ways to pay your premium bill: 1. Pay online by credit card, debit card, savings or checking account. To do this, log into (or create) your secure Medicare account at Medicare.gov. Paying online is a more secure and faster way to make your payment without sending your personal information in the mail. You'll get a confirmation number when you make your payment. 2. Pay directly from your savings or checking account through your bank's online bill payment services. Ask your bank if it allows customers to pay bills online\u2014not all banks offer this service and some may charge a fee.

Important!2525 Note: See pages 121-124 for definitions of blue words. SECTION 2 Find out if Medicare covers your test, item, or service What services does Medicare cover? Medicare Part A and Part B cover certain medical services and supplies in hospitals, doctors' offices, and other health care facilities. Medicare Part D covers prescription drugs. Your red, white, and blue Medicare card shows whether you have Part A (listed as HOSPITAL), Part B (listed as MEDICAL), or both, and the date your coverage begins. If you have Original Medicare, you'll use it to get your Medicare-covered services. If you join a Medicare Advantage Plan or other Medicare health plan , in most cases, you'll use your plan's card to get your Medicare-covered services. You can get all of the Medicare-covered services in this section if you have both Part A and Part B. Note: If you're not lawfully present in the U.S., Medicare won't pay for your Part A and Part B claims, and you can't join a Medicare Advantage Plan or a Medicare drug plan. What does Part A cover? Part A (Hospital Insurance) helps cover: Inpatient care in a hospital Inpatient care in a skilled nursing facility (not custodial or long-term care) Hospice care Home health care Inpatient care in a religious non-medical health care institution See pages 26-29 for a list of common services Part A covers and general descriptions. For more information on Part A-covered services, visit Medicare.gov/coverage .

Available in the App Store and Google Play. 26 SECTION 2: Find out if Medicare covers your test, item, or service26 What do I pay for services Part A covers? Copayments , coinsurance , or deductibles may apply for each service listed on the following pages. If you're in a Medicare Advantage Plan or have other insurance (like Medigap , Medicaid , or employer or union coverage), your copayments, coinsurance, or deductibles may be different. Visit Medicare.gov/plan-compare or contact the plans you're interested in to find out about costs. Or, call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227). TTY users can call 1-877-486-2048. Part A-covered services Blood If the hospital gets blood from a blood bank at no charge, you won't have to pay for it or replace it. If the hospital has to buy blood for you, you must either pay the hospital costs for the first 3 units of blood you get in a calendar year, or you or someone else can donate the blood. Home health services Part A and/or Part B covers home health benefits. See page 43 . Hospice care To qualify for hospice care, a hospice doctor and your doctor (if you have one) must certify that you're terminally ill, meaning you have a life expectancy of 6 months or less. When you agree to hospice care, you're agreeing to comfort care (palliative care) instead of care to cure your terminal illness. You also must sign a statement choosing hospice care instead of other Medicare-covered treatments for your terminal illness and related conditions. Coverage includes: All items and services needed for pain relief and symptom management Medical, nursing, and social services Drugs for pain management Durable medical equipment for pain relief and symptom management Aide and homemaker services Other covered services you need to manage your pain and other symptoms, as well as spiritual and grief counseling for you and your family. Medicare-certified hospice care is usually given in your home or other facility where you live, like a nursing home. Original Medicare will still pay for covered benefits for any health problems that aren't part of your terminal illness and related conditions, but hospice should cover most of your care. Medicare won't pay room and board for your care in a facility unless the hospice medical team decides you need short-term inpatient care to manage pain and other symptoms. This care must be in a Medicare-approved facility, like a hospice facility, hospital, or skilled nursing facility that contracts with the hospice. 27 SECTION 2: Find out if Medicare covers your test, item, or service27 Medicare also covers inpatient respite care, which is care you get in a Medicare-approved facility so that your usual caregiver (family member or friend) can rest. You can stay up to 5 days each time you get respite care. After 6 months, you can continue to get hospice care as long as the hospice medical director or hospice doctor recertifies (at a face-to-face meeting) that you're still terminally ill. You pay: Nothing for hospice care. A copayment of up to $5 per prescription for outpatient drugs for pain and symptom management. Five percent of the Medicare-approved amount for inpatient respite care. Original Medicare will be billed for your hospice care, even if you're in a Medicare Advantage Plan . When you get hospice care, your Medicare Advantage Plan can still cover services that aren't a part of your terminal illness or any conditions related to your terminal illness. Contact your plan for more information. Inpatient hospital care Medicare covers semi-private rooms, meals, general nursing, drugs (including methadone to treat an opioid use disorder), and other hospital services and supplies as part of your inpatient treatment. This includes care you get in acute care hospitals, critical access hospitals , inpatient rehabilitation facilities , long-term care hospitals , psychiatric care in inpatient psychiatric facilities, and inpatient care for a qualifying clinical research study. This doesn't include private-duty nursing, a television or phone in your room (if there's a separate charge for these items), personal care items (razors or slipper socks), or a private room, unless medically necessary . If you also have Part B, it generally covers 80% of the Medicare-approved amount for doctors' services you get while you're in a hospital. You pay: A deductible and no coinsurance for days 1-60 of each benefit period . A coinsurance amount per day for days 61-90 of each benefit period. A coinsurance amount per \" lifetime reserve day \" after day 90 of each benefit period (up to 60 days over your lifetime). All costs for each day after you use all the lifetime reserve days. You can only get inpatient psychiatric care in a freestanding psychiatric hospital 190 days in a lifetime. Note: Hospitals are now required to make public the standard charges for all of their items and services (including charges negotiated by Medicare Advantage Plans) to help you make more informed decisions about your care. 28 SECTION 2: Find out if Medicare covers your test, item, or service28 Am I an inpatient or outpatient? Whether you're an inpatient or an outpatient affects how much you pay for hospital services and if you qualify for Part A skilled nursing facility coverage. You're an inpatient when the hospital formally admits you with a doctor's order. You're an outpatient if you're getting emergency or observation services (which may include an overnight stay in the hospital or services in an outpatient clinic), lab tests, or X-rays, without a formal inpatient admission (even if you spend the night in the hospital). Each day you have to stay, you or your caregiver should always ask the hospital and/or your doctor, or a hospital social worker or patient advocate, if you're an inpatient or outpatient. Sometimes doctors will keep you as an outpatient for observation services while they decide whether to admit you as an inpatient or release (discharge) you. If you're under observation more than 24 hours, you must get a \"Medicare Outpatient Observation Notice\" (also called \"MOON\"). This notice tells you why you're an outpatient (in a hospital or critical access hospital ) getting observation services, and how it affects what you pay in the hospital and for care after you leave. Religious non-medical health care institution (inpatient care) If you qualify for inpatient hospital or skilled nursing facility care in these facilities, Medicare will only cover inpatient, non-religious, non-medical items and services like room and board, and items or services that don't need a doctor's order or prescription (like unmedicated wound dressings or use of a simple walker). Medicare doesn't cover the religious portion of this type of care. Skilled nursing facility care Medicare covers semi-private rooms, meals, skilled nursing and therapy services, and other medically necessary services and supplies in a skilled nursing facility. Medicare only covers these services after a 3-day minimum (not including the day you leave the hospital), medically necessary, inpatient hospital stay for a related illness or injury. If you're in a Medicare Advantage Plan , you may not need a 3-day hospital stay. Check with your plan. ( Note: You may not need a 3-day minimum inpatient hospital stay if your doctor participates in an Accountable Care Organization or an entity participating in another type of Medicare initiative approved for a Skilled Nursing Facility 3-Day Rule Waiver. See page 114 .) You may get skilled nursing or therapy care if it's necessary to improve or maintain your current condition. You can appeal if you disagree with your discharge, like if the discharge is based solely on a lack of improvement, even though you still require skilled nursing or therapy care to keep your condition from getting worse. See page 100 for more information about your rights to appeal. To qualify for skilled nursing facility care, your doctor must certify that you need daily skilled care (like intravenous fluids/medications or physical therapy) which, as a practical matter, you can only get as a skilled nursing facility inpatient. Medicare doesn't cover long-term care. See page 55 .29 SECTION 2: Find out if Medicare covers your test, item, or service29 You pay: Nothing for the first 20 days of each benefit period . (Note: If you're in a Medicare Advantage Plan , you may be charged copayments during the first 20 days.) A coinsurance amount per day for days 21-100 of each benefit period. All costs for each day after day 100 in a benefit period. What does Part B cover? Medicare Part B (Medical Insurance) helps cover medically necessary doctor's services, outpatient care, home health services, durable medical equipment, mental health services, and other medical services. Part B also covers many preventive services . See pages 30-54 for a list of common Part B-covered services and general descriptions. Medicare may cover some services and tests more often than the timeframes listed if needed to diagnose or treat a condition. To find out if Medicare covers a service not on this list, visit Medicare.gov/coverage or call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227). TTY users can call 1-877-486-2048. For more information on Part B-covered services, visit Medicare.gov/coverage . What do I pay for services Part B covers? The list of covered services (in alphabetical order on the following pages) gives general information about what you pay if you have Original Medicare and see doctors or other health care providers who accept assignment (see page 59 ). You'll pay more if you see doctors or providers who don't accept assignment. If you're in a Medicare Advantage Plan or have other insurance (like Medigap , Medicaid , or employer or union coverage), your copayments, coinsurance, or deductibles may be different. Contact your plan for more information. Under Original Medicare, if the Part B deductible ($233 in 2022) applies, you must pay all costs (up to the Medicare-approved amount ) until you meet the yearly Part B deductible. After you meet your deductible, Medicare begins to pay its share and you typically pay 20% of the Medicare-approved amount of the service (if the doctor or other health care provider accepts assignment). There's no yearly limit on what you pay out-of-pocket. There may be limits on expenses you pay through supplemental coverage you may have, like Medigap, Medicaid, or employer or union coverage. You pay nothing for most covered preventive services if you get the services from a doctor or other qualified health care provider who accepts assignment. However, for some preventive services, you may have to pay a deductible, coinsurance, or both. These costs may also apply if you get a preventive service in the same visit as a non-preventive service. 30 SECTION 2: Find out if Medicare covers your test, item, or service30 Part B-covered services Preventive service Abdominal aortic aneurysm screenings Medicare covers an abdominal aortic aneurysm screening ultrasound once if you're at risk (only with a referral from your doctor or other qualified health care provider). You pay nothing for the screening if your doctor or other qualified health care practitioner accepts assignment. Note: If you have a family history of abdominal aortic aneurysms, or you're a man 65-75 and have smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your lifetime, you're considered at risk. Acupuncture Medicare covers up to 12 acupuncture visits in 90 days for chronic low back pain defined as: Lasting 12 weeks or longer Having no known cause (not related to cancer that has spread, or inflammatory or infectious disease) Pain not associated with surgery or pregnancy Medicare covers an additional 8 sessions if you show improvement. If your doctor decides your chronic low back pain isn't improving or is getting worse, then Medicare won't cover your additional treatments. No more than 20 acupuncture treatments can be given in a 12-month period. Note: Medicare doesn't cover acupuncture (including dry needling) for any condition other than chronic low back pain. Advance care planning Medicare covers voluntary advance care planning as part of your yearly \"Wellness\" visit (see page 54 ). This is planning for care you would get if you become unable to speak for yourself. You can talk about an advance directive with your health care provider, and they can help you fill out the forms, if you prefer. An advance directive is an important legal document that records your wishes about medical treatment at a future time, if you aren't able to make decisions about your care. Consider carefully who you want to speak for you and what directions you want to give. You shouldn't feel forced to go against your values and preferences, and you have the right to carry out your plans without discrimination based on your age or disability. You can update your advance directive at any time. You pay nothing if it's provided as part of the yearly \"Wellness\" visit and your doctor or other qualified health care provider accepts assignment. Note: Medicare may also cover this service as part of your medical treatment. When advance care planning isn't part of your yearly \"Wellness\" visit, the Part B deductible and coinsurance apply. Need help with your advance directive? Visit the Eldercare Locator at eldercare.acl.gov to find help in your community.31 SECTION 2: Find out if Medicare covers your test, item, or service31 Preventive service Alcohol misuse screenings & counseling Medicare covers an alcohol misuse screening if you're an adult (including if you're a pregnant woman) who uses alcohol, but you don't meet the medical criteria for alcohol dependency. If your primary care doctor or other primary care practitioner determines you're misusing alcohol, you can get up to 4 brief face-to-face counseling sessions per year (if you're competent and alert during counseling). You must get counseling in a primary care setting, like a doctor's office. You pay nothing if your qualified primary care doctor or other primary care practitioner accepts assignment. Ambulance services Medicare covers ground ambulance transportation when you need to be transported to a hospital, critical access hospital, or skilled nursing facility for medically necessary services, and transportation in any other vehicle could endanger your health. Medicare may pay for emergency ambulance transportation in an airplane or helicopter to a hospital if you need immediate and rapid ambulance transportation that ground transportation can't provide. In some cases, Medicare may pay for limited, medically necessary, non-emergency ambulance transportation if you have a written order from your doctor stating that ambulance transportation is medically necessary. For example, someone with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) may need a medically necessary ambulance transport to a facility that furnishes renal dialysis. Medicare will only cover ambulance services to the nearest appropriate medical facility that's able to give you the care you need. You pay 20% of the Medicare-approved amount. The Part B deductible applies. Ambulatory surgical centers Medicare covers the facility service fees related to approved surgical procedures provided in an ambulatory surgical center (facility where surgical procedures are performed, and the patient is expected to be released within 24 hours). Except for certain preventive services (for which you pay nothing if your doctor or other health care provider accepts assignment), you pay 20% of the Medicare-approved amount to both the ambulatory surgical center and the doctor who treats you.

Medicare covers counseling, therapy services, and assessments both in-person and by virtual delivery (using audio and video communication technology, like your phone or a computer). Medicare pays doctors and other providers for office-based opioid use disorder treatment, including management, care coordination, psychotherapy, and counseling activities. Under Original Medicare, you won't have to pay any copayments for these services if you get them from an opioid treatment program provider who's enrolled in Medicare. However, the Part B deductible still applies. Talk to your doctor or other health care provider to find out where to go for these services. You can also visit Medicare .gov/talk-to-someone and select \"Opioid Treatment Program Services\" to find a program near you. Medicare Advantage Plans must also cover opioid treatment program services. If you're in a Medicare Advantage Plan, your current opioid treatment program must be Medicare-enrolled to make sure your treatment stays uninterrupted. If not, you may have to switch to a Medicare-enrolled opioid treatment program. Since Medicare Advantage Plans can apply copayments to opioid treatment program services, you should check with your plan to see if you have to pay a copayment. Outpatient hospital services Medicare covers many diagnostic and treatment services you get as an outpatient from a Medicare-participating hospital. Generally, you pay 20% of the Medicare-approved amount for your doctors' or other health care providers' services. You may pay more for services you get in a hospital outpatient setting than you'll pay for the same care in a doctor's office. In addition to the amount you pay the doctor, you'll also usually pay the hospital a copayment for each service you get in a hospital outpatient setting (except for certain preventive services that don't have a copayment). In most cases, the copayment can't be more than the Part A hospital stay deductible for each service. The Part B deductible applies, except for certain preventive services. If you get hospital outpatient services in a critical access hospital , your copayment may be higher and may exceed the Part A hospital stay deductible. Cost & coverage: Visit Medicare.gov/procedure-price-lookup to get cost estimates for hospital outpatient procedures done in hospital outpatient departments.48 SECTION 2: Find out if Medicare covers your test, item, or service48 Outpatient medical & surgical services & supplies Medicare covers approved procedures, like X-rays, casts, stitches, or outpatient surgeries. You pay 20% of the Medicare-approved amount for doctor or other health care provider services. You generally pay a copayment for each service you get in a hospital outpatient setting. In most cases, the copayment can't be more than the Part A hospital stay deductible for each service you get. The Part B deductible applies, and you pay all costs for items or services that Medicare doesn't cover. Physical therapy Medicare covers evaluation and treatment for injuries and diseases that change your ability to function, or to improve or maintain current function or slow decline, when your doctor or other health care provider certifies you need it. You pay 20% of the Medicare-approved amount. The Part B deductible applies. Preventive service Pneumococcal shots Medicare covers pneumococcal shots (or vaccines) to help prevent pneumococcal infections (like certain types of pneumonia). The 2 shots protect against different strains of the bacteria. Medicare covers the first shot at any time, and also covers a different second shot if it's given one year (or later) after the first shot. Talk with your doctor or other health care provider to see if you need one or both of the pneumococcal shots. You pay nothing for these shots if the doctor or other qualified health care provider accepts assignment for giving the shots. Preventive service Prostate cancer screenings Medicare covers digital rectal exams and prostate specific antigen (PSA) tests once every 12 months for men over 50 (starting the day after your 50th birthday). For the digital rectal exam, you pay 20% of the Medicare-approved amount . The Part B deductible applies. You also pay a copayment in a hospital outpatient setting. You pay nothing for the PSA test. Prosthetic/orthotic items Medicare covers these prosthetics/orthotics when a Medicare-enrolled doctor or other health care provider orders them: arm, leg, back, and neck braces; artificial eyes; artificial limbs (and their replacement parts); and prosthetic devices needed to replace an internal body organ or function of the organ (including ostomy supplies, parenteral and enteral nutrition therapy, and some types of breast prostheses after a mastectomy). For Medicare to cover your prosthetic or orthotic, you must go to a supplier that's enrolled in Medicare. You pay 20% of the Medicare-approved amount. The Part B deductible applies. Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supplies (DMEPOS) Competitive Bidding Program: To get an off-the-shelf back or knee brace in most areas of the country, you generally must use specific suppliers called \"contract suppliers.\" Otherwise, Medicare won't pay and you'll likely pay full price. See page 4 0 for more information. Important!49 SECTION 2: Find out if Medicare covers your test, item, or service49 Pulmonary rehabilitation programs Medicare covers a comprehensive pulmonary rehabilitation program if you have moderate to very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and have a referral from the doctor treating this chronic respiratory disease. You pay 20% of the Medicare-approved amount if you get the service in a doctor's office. You also pay a copayment per session if you get the service in a hospital outpatient setting. The Part B deductible applies. Starting January 1, 2022, Medicare will also cover pulmonary rehabilitation if you've had confirmed or suspected COVID-19 and experience persistent symptoms that include respiratory dysfunction for at least 4 weeks. Rural health clinic services Rural health clinics provide many outpatient primary care and preventive health services in rural and underserved areas. Generally, you pay 20% of the charges. The Part B deductible applies. You pay nothing for most preventive services . Second surgical opinions Medicare covers a second surgical opinion in some cases for medically necessary surgery that isn't an emergency. In some cases, Medicare covers third surgical opinions. You pay 20% of the Medicare-approved amount . The Part B deductible applies. Preventive service Sexually transmitted infection (STI) screenings & counseling Medicare covers STI screenings for chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, and/or Hepatitis B. Medicare covers these screenings if you're pregnant or at increased risk for an STI when your primary care provider orders the tests. Medicare covers these tests once every 12 months or at certain times during pregnancy. Medicare also covers up to 2 individual, 20-30 minute, face-to-face, high-intensity behavioral counseling sessions each year if you're a sexually active adult at increased risk for STIs. Medicare will only cover these counseling sessions with a primary care doctor in a primary care setting (like a doctor's office). Medicare won't cover counseling as a preventive service in an inpatient setting, like a skilled nursing facility . You pay nothing for these services if your primary care doctor or other qualified health care provider accepts assignment . Shots (or vaccines) Part B covers: Flu shots. See page 4 1. Hepatitis B shots. See page 4 2. Pneumococcal shots. See page 48 . Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine. See page 37 . Medicare drug coverage (Part D) generally covers all other recommended adult immunizations (like shingles, Tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis vaccines) to prevent illness. Talk to your provider about which ones are right for you.New!50 SECTION 2: Find out if Medicare covers your test, item, or service50 Speech-language pathology services Medicare covers medically necessary evaluation and treatment to regain and strengthen speech and language skills.

You pay nothing for the supplies and 20% of the Medicare-approved amount for your doctor or other health care provider services. You pay a set copayment for these services when you get them in a hospital outpatient setting. The Part B deductible applies. Telehealth Medicare covers certain telehealth services provided by a doctor or other health care provider who's located elsewhere using audio and video communication technology, like your phone or a computer. Telehealth can provide many services that generally occur in-person, including office visits, psychotherapy, consultations, and certain other medical or health services, but only when you're at an office or other medical facility located in a rural area. You can get certain Medicare telehealth services without being in a rural health care setting, including: Monthly End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) visits for home dialysis. Services for diagnosis, evaluation, or treatment of symptoms of an acute stroke wherever you are, including in a mobile stroke unit. Services to treat a substance use disorder or a co-occurring mental health disorder (sometimes called a \"dual disorder\") in your home. You pay 20% of the Medicare-approved amount for your doctor or other health care provider's services. The Part B deductible applies. For most of these services, you'll pay the same amount you would if you got the services in person. Compare: Medicare Advantage Plans and providers who are part of certain Medicare Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) may offer more telehealth benefits than Original Medicare. For example, these telehealth benefits may be available no matter where you're located, and you may be able to use them at home instead of going to a health care facility. Check with your plan to see what benefits they offer. If your provider participates in an ACO, check with them to see what telehealth benefits may be available. See pages 113-114 .51 SECTION 2: Find out if Medicare covers your test, item, or service51 Tests Medicare covers X-rays, MRIs, CT scans, EKG/ECGs, and some other diagnostic tests. You pay 20% of the Medicare-approved amount . The Part B deductible applies. If you get the test at a hospital as an outpatient, you also pay the hospital a copayment that may be more than 20% of the Medicare-approved amount. In most cases, this amount can't be more than the Part A hospital stay deductible. See Laboratory services on page 44 for other Part B-covered tests. Transitional care management services Medicare may cover this service if you're returning to your community after a stay at certain facilities, like a hospital or skilled nursing facility. The health care provider who's managing your transition back into the community will work to coordinate and manage your care for the first 30 days after you return home. They'll work with you, your family, caregivers, and other providers. You'll also get an in-person office visit within 2 weeks of your return home. The health care provider may also review information on the care you received in the facility, provide information to help you transition back to living at home, work with other care providers, help you with referrals or arrangements for follow-up care or community resources, help you with scheduling, and help you manage your medications. The Part B deductible and coinsurance apply. Transplants & immunosuppressive drugs Medicare covers doctor services for heart, lung, kidney, pancreas, intestine, and liver transplants under certain conditions, but only in Medicare-certified facilities. Medicare also covers bone marrow and cornea transplants under certain conditions. Note: Medicare may cover transplant surgery as a hospital inpatient service under Part A. See pages 27-28 . Medicare covers immunosuppressive drugs if Medicare paid for the transplant. You must have Part A at the time of the covered transplant, and you must have Part B at the time you get immunosuppressive drugs. You pay 20% of the Medicare-approved amount for the drugs. The Part B deductible applies. If you're thinking about joining a Medicare Advantage Plan and are on a transplant waiting list or think you need a transplant, check with the plan before you join to make sure your doctors, other health care providers, and hospitals are in the plan's network. Also, check the plan's coverage rules for prior authorization. Note: Medicare drug coverage (Part D) covers immunosuppressive drugs if Part B doesn't cover them. Medicare pays the full cost of care for your kidney donor. You and your donor won't have to pay a deductible, coinsurance , or any other costs for their hospital stay.52 SECTION 2: Find out if Medicare covers your test, item, or service52 Travel Medicare generally doesn't cover health care while you're traveling outside the U.S. (the \"U.S.\" includes the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa). There are some exceptions, including cases where Medicare may pay for services you get while on board a ship within the territorial waters adjoining the land areas of the U.S. Medicare may pay for inpatient hospital, doctor, or ambulance services you get in a foreign country in these rare cases: You're in the U.S. when an emergency occurs, and the foreign hospital is closer than the nearest U.S. hospital that can treat your medical condition. You're traveling through Canada without unreasonable delay by the most direct route between Alaska and another U.S. state when a medical emergency occurs, and the Canadian hospital is closer than the nearest U.S. hospital that can treat the emergency. You live in the U.S. and the foreign hospital is closer to your home than the nearest U.S. hospital that can treat your medical condition, regardless of whether an emergency exists. Medicare may cover medically necessary ambulance transportation to a foreign hospital only with admission for medically necessary covered inpatient hospital services. You pay 20% of the Medicare-approved amount . The Part B deductible applies. Urgently needed care Medicare covers urgently needed care to treat a sudden illness or injury that isn't a medical emergency. You pay 20% of the Medicare-approved amount for your doctor or other health care provider services, and a copayment in a hospital outpatient setting. The Part B deductible applies. 53 SECTION 2: Find out if Medicare covers your test, item, or service53 Virtual check-ins Medicare covers virtual check-ins (also called \"brief communication technology-based services\") with your doctor or certain other practitioners, like nurse practitioners or physician assistants, using audio and video communication technology, like your phone or a computer. Your doctor can also conduct remote assessments using photo or video images you send for review to see whether you need to go to the doctor's office. Your doctor or other provider can respond to you by phone, virtual delivery, secure text message, email, or patient portal. You can use these services if you have met these conditions: You have talked to your doctor or other provider about starting these types of visits. The virtual check-in must not be related to a medical visit within the past 7 days and must not lead to the medical visit within the next 24 hours (or the soonest appointment available). You must verbally consent to the virtual check-in, and your consent must be documented in your medical record. Your doctor may get one consent for a year's worth of these services. You pay 20% of the Medicare-approved amount for your doctor or other health care provider services. The Part B deductible applies. Preventive service \"Welcome to Medicare\" preventive visit During the first 12 months that you have Part B, you can get a \"Welcome to Medicare\" preventive visit. The visit includes a review of your medical and social history related to your health. It also includes education and counseling about preventive services , including certain screenings, shots or vaccines (like flu, pneumococcal, and other recommended shots or vaccines), and referrals for other care, if needed. When you make your appointment, let your doctor's office know that you'd like to schedule your \"Welcome to Medicare\" preventive visit. You pay nothing for the \"Welcome to Medicare\" preventive visit if the doctor or other qualified health care provider accepts assignment . If you have a current prescription for opioids, your provider will review your potential risk factors for opioid use disorder, evaluate your severity of pain and current treatment plan, provide information on non-opioid treatment options, and may refer you to a specialist, if appropriate. Your provider will also review your potential risk factors for substance use disorder and refer you for treatment, if needed. If your doctor or other health care provider performs additional tests or services during the same visit that Medicare doesn't cover under this preventive benefit, you may have to pay coinsurance , and the Part B deductible may apply. If Medicare doesn't cover the additional tests or services (like a routine physical exam), you may have to pay the full amount. New! Important!54 SECTION 2: Find out if Medicare covers your test, item, or service54 Preventive service Yearly \"Wellness\" visit If you've had Part B for longer than 12 months, you can get a yearly \"Wellness\" visit to develop or update your personalized plan to prevent disease or disability based on your current health and risk factors. The yearly \"Wellness\" visit isn't a physical exam. Medicare covers this visit once every 12 months. Your provider will ask you to fill out a questionnaire, called a \"Health Risk Assessment,\" as part of this visit. Answering these questions can help you and your provider develop a personalized prevention plan to help you stay healthy and get the most out of your visit. Your provider will also perform a cognitive assessment to look for signs of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease. Signs of cognitive impairment include trouble remembering, learning new things, concentrating, managing finances, and making decisions about your everyday life. If your provider thinks you may have cognitive impairment, Medicare covers a separate visit to do a more thorough review of your cognitive function and check for conditions like dementia, depression, anxiety, or delirium. See page 34 . If you have a current prescription for opioids, your provider will perform services during your visit. See the \"New!\" flag on page 53 to learn more. Note: Your first yearly \"Wellness\" visit can't take place within 12 months of your Part B enrollment or your \"Welcome to Medicare\" preventive visit. However, you don't need to have had a \"Welcome to Medicare\" preventive visit to qualify for a yearly \"Wellness\" visit. You pay nothing for the yearly \"Wellness\" visit if the doctor or other qualified health care provider accepts assignment . If your doctor or other health care provider performs additional tests or services during the same visit that Medicare doesn't cover under this preventive benefit, you may have to pay a coinsurance , and the Part B deductible may apply. If Medicare doesn't cover the additional tests or services (like a routine physical exam), you may have to pay the full amount.New! New! Important!55 SECTION 2: Find out if Medicare covers your test, item, or service55 What's NOT covered by Part A and Part B? Medicare doesn't cover everything. If you need certain services Part A or Part B doesn't cover, you'll have to pay for them yourself unless: You have other coverage (including Medicaid ) to cover the costs. You're in a Medicare Advantage Plan or Medicare Cost Plan that covers these services. Medicare Advantage Plans and Medicare Cost Plans may cover some extra benefits, like fitness programs and vision, hearing, and dental services. Some of the items and services that Original Medicare doesn't cover include: Most dental care Eye exams (for prescription glasses) Dentures Cosmetic surgery Massage therapy Routine physical exams Hearing aids and exams for fitting them Long-term care Concierge care (also called concierge medicine, retainer-based medicine, boutique medicine, platinum practice, or direct care) Covered items or services you get from an opt out doctor (see page 60 ) or other provider (except in the case of an emergency or urgent need) Paying for long-term care Long-term care (sometimes called \"long-term services and supports\") includes non-medical care for people who have a chronic illness or disability. This includes non-skilled personal care assistance, like help with everyday activities, including dressing, bathing and using the bathroom. Non-medical care also includes home-delivered meals, adult day health care, and other services. Medicare and most health insurance, including Medicare Supplement Insurance ( Medigap ), don't pay for this type of care. You may be eligible for this care through Medicaid, or you can choose to buy private long-term care insurance. You can get long-term care at home, in the community, in an assisted living facility, or in a nursing home. It's important to start planning for long-term care now to maintain your independence and to make sure you get the care you may need, in the setting you want, now and in the future. 56 SECTION 2: Find out if Medicare covers your test, item, or service56 Long-term care resources Use these resources to get more information about long-term care: Visit longtermcare .acl.gov to learn more about planning for long-term care.

SECTION 3 Original Medicare How does Original Medicare work? Original Medicare is one of your Medicare health coverage choices. You'll have Original Medicare unless you choose a Medicare Advantage Plan or other type of Medicare health plan . You generally have to pay a portion of the cost for each service Original Medicare covers. There's no limit to what you'll pay out of pocket in a year unless you have other coverage (like Medigap , Medicaid , or employee or union coverage) or enroll in a Medicare Advantage Plan. See page 59 for the general rules about how it works. Original Medicare Can I get my health care from any doctor, other health care provider, or hospital? In most cases, yes. You can go to any Medicare-enrolled doctor, other health care provider, hospital, or other facility that accepts Medicare patients anywhere in the U.S. Visit Medicare.gov/care-compare to find and compare providers, hospitals, and facilities in your area. Does it cover prescription drugs? No, with a few exceptions (see pages 26-27 , 47, and 51 ), Original Medicare doesn't cover most drugs. You can add Medicare drug coverage (Part D) by joining a separate Medicare drug plan. See pages 79-90 . Do I need to choose a primary care doctor? No. Do I have to get a referral to see a specialist? In most cases, no. Should I get a supplemental policy? You may already have Medicaid, military retiree, or employer or union coverage that may pay costs that Original Medicare doesn't. If not, you may want to buy a Medicare Supplement Insurance (Medigap) policy if you're eligible. See pages 75-78 . 58 SECTION 3: Original Medicare58 What else do I need to know about Original Medicare? You generally pay a set amount for your health care ( deductible ) before Medicare pays its share. Once Medicare pays its share, you pay a coinsurance or copayment for covered services and supplies. There's no yearly limit for what you pay out of pocket unless you have other insurance (like Medigap , Medicaid , or employee, retiree, or union coverage). You usually pay a monthly premium for Part B. You generally don't need to file Medicare claims. Providers and suppliers must file your claims for the covered services and supplies you get. What do I pay? Your out of pocket costs in Original Medicare depend on: Whether you have Part A and/or Part B. Most people have both. Whether your doctor, other health care provider, or supplier accepts \"assignment .\" See page 59 . The type of health care you need and how often you need it. If you choose to get services or supplies Medicare doesn't cover. If so, you pay all costs unless you have other insurance that covers them. Whether you have other health insurance that works with Medicare. Whether you have Medicaid or get help from your state to pay your Medicare costs. Whether you have Medicare Supplement Insurance (Medigap). Whether you and your doctor or other health care provider sign a private contract. See page 60. 5959 SECTION 3: Original Medicare59 How do I know what Medicare paid? If you have Original Medicare, you'll get a \"Medicare Summary Notice\" (MSN) that lists all the services billed to Medicare. You can sign up to get this Notice electronically every month (see below) or a Medicare contractor will mail it to you every 3 months. It's not a bill. The MSN shows what Medicare paid and what you may owe the provider. Review your MSNs to be sure you got all the services, supplies, or equipment listed. If you disagree with Medicare's decision not to pay for (cover) a service, the MSN will tell you how to appeal. See page 99 for information on how to file an appeal. If you need to change your address on your MSN, call Social Security at 1-800-772-1213. TTY users can call 1-800-325-0778. If you get Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) benefits, call the RRB at 1-877-772-5772. TTY users can call 1-312-751-4701. Your MSN will tell you if you're enrolled in the Qualified Medicare Beneficiary (QMB) program. If you're in the QMB program, Medicare providers aren't allowed to bill you for Medicare Part A and/or Part B deductibles , coinsurance , or copayments . In some cases, you may be billed a small copayment through Medicaid , if one applies. For more information about QMB and steps to take if a provider bills you for these costs, see page 94 . Get your Medicare Summary Notices electronically Sign up to get your \"Medicare Summary Notices\" (also called \"eMSNs\") electronically. Visit Medicare.gov to log into (or create) your secure Medicare account . If you sign up for eMSNs, we'll send you an email each month when they're available in your online Medicare account. The eMSNs have the same information as paper MSNs. You won't get printed copies in the mail if you choose eMSNs. You have options in how you get your Medicare claims information. A growing number of computer and mobile apps are connected to Medicare through Blue Button 2.0. If you agree to share your information with one of these apps, it can show you the details of the claims that Medicare has paid on your behalf. See page 111 for more information. What's assignment? Assignment means that your doctor, provider, or supplier agrees (or is required by law) to accept the Medicare-approved amount as full payment for covered services. If your doctor, provider, or supplier accepts assignment: Your out-of-pocket costs may be less. They agree to charge you only the Medicare deductible and coinsurance amount and usually wait for Medicare to pay its share before asking you to pay your share. They have to submit your claim directly to Medicare and can't charge you for submitting the claim. Important!60 SECTION 3: Original Medicare60 Some providers haven't agreed and aren't required by law to accept assignment for all Medicare-covered services, but they can still choose to accept assignment for individual services. The providers who haven't agreed to accept assignment for all services are called \"non-participating.\" You might have to pay more for their services if they don't accept assignment for the care they provide to you. Here's what happens if your doctor, provider, or supplier doesn't accept assignment: You might have to pay the entire charge at the time of service. Your doctor, provider, or supplier is supposed to submit a claim to Medicare for any Medicare-covered services they provide to you. If they don't submit the Medicare claim once you ask them to, call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227). TTY users can call 1-877-486-2048. They can charge you more than the Medicare-approved amount. In many cases, the charge can't be more than an amount called \"the limiting charge.\" If you have Original Medicare, you can see any provider you want that takes Medicare, anywhere in the U.S. Compare: If you have a Medicare Advantage Plan, in most cases, you'll need to use doctors and other providers who are in the plan's network. To find out if someone accepts assignment or participates in Medicare, visit Medicare.gov/care-compare or Medicare.gov/medical-equipment-suppliers . TTY users can call 1-877-486-2048. You can also contact your State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP) to get free help with these topics. See pages 117-120 for the phone number. What if I want to use a provider who opts out of Medicare? Certain doctors and other health care providers who don't want to work with the Medicare program may \"opt out\" of Medicare. Medicare doesn't pay for any covered items or services you get from an opt out doctor or other provider, except in the case of an emergency or urgent need. If you still want to see an opt out provider, you and your provider can set up payment terms that you both agree to through a private contract. A doctor or other provider who chooses to opt out must do so for 2 years, which automatically renews every 2 years unless the provider requests not to renew their opt out status. If you want to find a provider who's opted out of Medicare, visit Medicare .gov/forms-help-resources/find-providers-whove- opted-out-of-medicare . You can search for a provider by their first and last name, National Provider Identifier (NPI) , specialty, or ZIP code. 6161 Note: See pages 121-124 for definitions of blue words. SECTION 4 Medicare Advantage Plans & other options What are Medicare Advantage Plans? A Medicare Advantage Plan is another way to get your Medicare Part A and Part B coverage. Medicare Advantage Plans, sometimes called \"Part C\" or \"MA Plans,\" are offered by Medicare-approved private companies that must follow rules set by Medicare. Most Medicare Advantage Plans include drug coverage (Part D). In most cases, you'll need to use health care providers who participate in the plan's network. These plans set a limit on what you'll have to pay out-of-pocket each year for covered services. Some plans offer non-emergency coverage out of network, but typically at a higher cost. Remember, you must use the card from your Medicare Advantage Plan to get your Medicare-covered services. Keep your red, white, and blue Medicare card in a safe place because you'll need it if you ever switch back to Original Medicare. If you join a Medicare Advantage Plan, you'll still have Medicare but you'll get most of your Part A and Part B coverage from your Medicare Advantage Plan, not Original Medicare. What are the different types of Medicare Advantage Plans? Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) plan: Point-of-Service (HMOPOS) plan: This HMO plan may allow you to get some services out of network for a higher copayment or coinsurance . See page 66 . Medical Savings Account (MSA) plans: See page 67 . Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) plan: See page 68 . Private Fee-for-Service (PFFS) plan: See page 69. Special Needs Plan (SNP): See page 70 . What do Medicare Advantage Plans cover? Medicare Advantage Plans provide all of your Part A and Part B benefits, excluding clinical trials, hospice services, and, for a temporary time, some new benefits that come from legislation or national coverage determinations. Plans must cover all emergency and urgent care, and almost all medically necessary services Original Medicare covers. If you're in a Medicare Advantage Plan, Original Medicare will still help cover the cost for hospice care, some new Medicare benefits, and some costs for clinical research studies. 62 SECTION 4: Medicare Advantage Plans & other options62 Plans can offer some extra benefits Most Medicare Advantage Plans offer coverage for things Original Medicare doesn't cover, like fitness programs (like gym memberships or discounts) and some vision, hearing, and dental services. Plans can also choose to cover even more benefits. For example, some plans may offer coverage for services like transportation to doctor visits, over-the-counter drugs, and services that promote your health and wellness. Plans can also tailor their benefit packages to offer additional benefits to certain chronically-ill enrollees. These packages will provide benefits customized to treat specific conditions. Check with the plan before you enroll to see what benefits it offers, if you might qualify, and if there are any limitations. Medicare Advantage Plans must follow Medicare's rules Medicare pays a fixed amount for your coverage each month to the companies offering Medicare Advantage Plans. These companies must follow rules set by Medicare. However, each Medicare Advantage Plan can charge different out-of-pocket costs and have different rules for how you get services (like whether you need a referral to see a specialist or if you have to go to doctors, facilities, or suppliers that belong to the plan's network for non-emergency or non-urgent care). These rules can change each year. The plan must notify you about any changes before the start of the next enrollment year. Remember, you have the option each year to keep your current plan, choose a different plan, or switch to Original Medicare. See page 71 . Providers can join or leave a plan's provider network any time during the year. Your plan can also change the providers in the network any time during the year. If this happens, you usually won't be able to change plans but you can choose a new provider. You generally can't change plans during the year. Even though the network of providers may change during the year, the plan must still give you access to qualified doctors and specialists. Your plan will make a good faith effort to give you at least 30 days' notice that your provider is leaving your plan so you have time to choose a new provider. Your plan will also help you choose a new provider to continue managing your health care needs. Compare: In most cases, you don't need a referral to see a specialist if you have Original Medicare (see page 57 ). You can also see any provider you want that takes Medicare, anywhere in the U.S.63 SECTION 4: Medicare Advantage Plans & other options63 Read the information you get from your plan If you're in a Medicare Advantage Plan , review the \"Annual Notice of Change\" and \"Evidence of Coverage\" from your plan each year: Annual Notice of Change: Includes any changes in coverage, costs, and more that will be effective starting in January. Your plan will send you a printed copy by September 30. Evidence of Coverage: Gives you details about what the plan covers, how much you pay, and more. Your plan will send you a notice (or printed copy) by October 15, which will include information on how to access the Evidence of Coverage electronically or request a printed copy. If you don't get these important documents, contact your plan. What should I know about Medicare Advantage Plans? Who can join?To join a Medicare Advantage Plan you must: Have Part A and Part B. Live in the plan's service area . Be a U.S. citizen or lawfully present in the U.S. Joining and leaving You can join a Medicare Advantage Plan even if you have a pre-existing condition. You can join or leave a Medicare Advantage Plan only at certain times during the year. See pages 71-72 . Each year, Medicare Advantage Plans can choose to leave Medicare or make changes in coverage, costs, service area, and more. If the plan decides to stop participating in Medicare, you'll have to join another Medicare Advantage Plan or return to Original Medicare. See page 98 . Medicare Advantage Plans must follow certain rules when giving you information about how to join their plan. See pages 105-106 for more information about these rules and how to protect your personal information. What if I have End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD)? If you have ESRD, you can choose either Original Medicare or a Medicare Advantage Plan when deciding how to get Medicare coverage. You can enroll in a Medicare Advantage Plan during Open Enrollment (October 15-December 7, 2021). Your plan coverage will start January 1, 2022. Medicare drug coverage (Part D) Most Medicare Advantage Plans include Medicare drug coverage (Part D). In certain types of plans that don't include Medicare drug coverage (like Medical Savings Account Plans and some Private-Fee-for-Service Plans), you can join a separate Medicare drug plan. However, if you join a Health Maintenance Organization or Preferred Provider Organization Plan which doesn't cover drugs, you can't join a separate Medicare drug plan. Important!64 SECTION 4: Medicare Advantage Plans & other options64 What if I have other coverage? Talk to your employer, union, or other benefits administrator about their rules before you join a Medicare Advantage Plan . In some cases, joining a Medicare Advantage Plan might cause you to lose your employer or union coverage for yourself, your spouse, and dependents and you may not be able to get it back. In other cases, if you join a Medicare Advantage Plan, you may still be able to use your employer or union coverage along with the Medicare Advantage Plan you join. Your employer or union may also offer a Medicare Advantage retiree health plan that they sponsor. You can only be in one Medicare Advantage Plan at a time. What if I have Medicare Supplement Insurance (Medigap)? You can't enroll in (and can't use) Medigap while you're in a Medicare Advantage Plan. You can't use Medigap to pay for any costs ( copayments , deductibles , and premiums ) you have under a Medicare Advantage Plan. If you already have Medigap and join a Medicare Advantage Plan, you may want to drop Medigap. Keep in mind that if you drop Medigap to join a Medicare Advantage Plan, you may not be able to get it back. See page 78 . What do I pay? Your out-of-pocket costs in a Medicare Advantage Plan depend on: Whether the plan charges a monthly premium. Many Medicare Advantage Plans have a $0 premium. If you enroll in a plan that does charge a premium, you pay this in addition to the Part B premium (and the Part A premium if you don't have premium-free Part A). Whether the plan pays any of your monthly Part B premiums. Some Medicare Advantage Plans will help pay all or part of your Part B premium. This is sometimes called a \"Medicare Part B premium reduction.\" Whether the plan has a yearly deductible or any additional deductibles for certain services. How much you pay for each visit or service (copayments or coinsurance ). Medicare Advantage Plans can't charge more than Original Medicare for certain services, like chemotherapy, dialysis, and skilled nursing facility care . The type of health care services you need and how often you get them. Whether you get services from a network provider or a provider that doesn't contract with the plan. If you go to a doctor, other health care provider, facility, or supplier that doesn't belong to the plan's network for non-emergency or non-urgent care services, your plan may not cover your services, or your costs could be higher. In most cases, this applies to Medicare Advantage Plans, Health Maintenance Organizations, and Preferred Provider Organizations. It also applies to Private Fee-for-Service Plans that have a contracted network of providers. Whether you go to a doctor or supplier who accepts assignment (if you're in a Preferred Provider Organization or Private Fee-for-Service plan, or Medical Savings Account plan and you go out of network). See page 59 for more information about assignment. Important!65 SECTION 4: Medicare Advantage Plans & other options65 Whether the plan offers extra benefits (in addition to Original Medicare benefits) and if you need to pay extra to get them. The plan's yearly limit on your out of pocket costs for all Part A and Part B medical services. Once you reach this limit, you'll pay nothing for Part A and Part B covered services. Whether you have Medicaid or get help from your state through a Medicare Savings Program. See pages 94-95 . To learn more about your costs in specific Medicare Advantage Plans , contact the plan or visit Medicare.gov/plan-compare . How do I find out if my plan covers a service, drug, or supply?You or your provider can get a decision, either orally or in writing, from your plan in advance to see if it covers a service, drug, or supply. You can also find out how much you'll have to pay. This is called an \"organization determination.\" Sometimes you have to do this as prior authorization for your plan to cover the service, drug, or supply. You, your representative, or your doctor can request an organization determination. The requested organization determination can be either oral or written. Based on your health needs, you, your representative, or your doctor can ask for a fast decision on your organization determination request. If your plan denies coverage, the plan must tell you in writing, and you have the right to appeal. See pages 98-100 . If a plan provider refers you for a service or to a provider outside the network, but doesn't get an organization determination in advance, this is called \"plan directed care.\" In most cases you won't have to pay more than the plan's usual cost sharing. Check with your plan for more information about this protection.66 SECTION 4: Medicare Advantage Plans & other options66 Types of Medicare Advantage Plans Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) plan Can I get my health care from any doctor, other health care provider, or hospital? No. You generally must get your care and services from doctors, other health care providers, or hospitals in the plan's network (except for emergency care, out-of-area urgent care, or temporary out-of-area dialysis, which is covered whether it's provided in the plan's network or outside the plan's network). However, some HMO plans, known as HMO Point-of-Service (HMOPOS) plans, offer an out of network benefit. Do these plans cover prescription drugs? In most cases, yes. If you're planning to enroll in an HMO and you want Medicare drug coverage (Part D), you must join an HMO plan that offers drug coverage. If you join an HMO plan without drug coverage, you can't join a separate Medicare drug plan. Do I need to choose a primary care doctor? In most cases, yes. Do I have to get a referral to see a specialist? In most cases, yes. Certain services, like yearly screening mammograms, don't require a referral. What else do I need to know about this type of plan? If your doctor or other health care provider leaves the HMO plan's network, your plan will notify you. You may choose another doctor in the plan's network. If you get non-emergency health care outside the plan's network without authorization, you may have to pay the full cost. It's important that you follow the plan's rules, like getting prior approval for a certain service when needed. Check with the plan for more information. Note: HMO POS plans (a type of HMO plan) may allow you get some services out of network for a higher copayment or coinsurance .67 SECTION 4: Medicare Advantage Plans & other options67 Medical Savings Account (MSA) plan Can I get my health care from any doctor, other health care provider, or hospital? Yes. MSA plans usually don't have a network of doctors, other health care providers, or hospitals. Do these plans cover prescription drugs? No. If you join a Medicare MSA plan and want Medicare drug coverage (Part D), you'll have to join a separate Medicare drug plan. Do I need to choose a primary care doctor? No. Do I have to get a referral to see a specialist? No. What else do I need to know about this type of plan? The plan deposits money into a special savings account for you to use to pay health care expenses. The amount of the deposit varies by plan. You can use this money to pay your Medicare-covered costs before you meet the deductible . Money left in your account at the end of the year stays there. If you keep your plan the following year, your plan will add any new deposits to the amount left over. MSA plans don't charge a premium , but you must continue to pay your Part B premium. The plan will only begin to cover your costs once you meet a high yearly deductible, which varies by plan. Some plans may cover some extra benefits, like dental, vision, and hearing services. You may pay a premium for this extra coverage. For more information about using your MSA plan, visit Medicare .gov or check with your plan.68 SECTION 4: Medicare Advantage Plans & other options68 Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) plan Can I get my health care from any doctor, other health care provider, or hospital? Yes. PPO plans have network doctors, specialists, hospitals, and other health care providers you can use. You can also use out-of-network providers for covered services, usually for a higher cost, if the provider agrees to treat you and hasn't opted out of Medicare (for Medicare Part A and Part B items and services). You're always covered for emergency and urgent care. Do these plans cover prescription drugs? In most cases, yes. If you're planning to enroll in a PPO and you want Medicare drug coverage (Part D), you must join a PPO plan that offers drug coverage. If you join a PPO Medicare Advantage Plan without drug coverage, you can't join a separate Medicare drug plan. Do I need to choose a primary care doctor? No. Do I have to get a referral to see a specialist? In most cases, no. But if you use plan specialists (in-network), your costs for covered services will usually be lower than if you use non-plan specialists (out of network). What else do I need to know about this type of plan? Because certain providers are \"preferred,\" you can save money by using them. Check with the plan for more information.69 SECTION 4: Medicare Advantage Plans & other options69 Private Fee-for-Service (PFFS) plan Can I get my health care from any doctor, other health care provider, or hospital? You can go to any Medicare-approved doctor, other health care provider, or hospital that accepts the plan's payment terms, agrees to treat you, and hasn't opted out of Medicare (for Medicare Part A and Part B items and services). If you join a PFFS plan that has a network, you can also see any of the network providers who have agreed to always treat plan members. If you choose an out-of-network doctor, hospital, or other provider who accepts the plan's terms, you may pay more. Do these plans cover prescription drugs? Sometimes. If your PFFS plan doesn't offer drug coverage, you can join a separate Medicare drug plan to get Medicare drug coverage (Part D). Do I need to choose a primary care doctor? No. Do I have to get a referral to see a specialist? No. What else do I need to know about this type of plan? The plan decides how much you pay for services. The plan will tell you about your cost sharing in the \" Annual Notice of Change\" and \"Evidence of Coverage\" documents that it sends each year. Some PFFS plans contract with a network of providers who agree to always treat you, even if you've never seen them before. Out of network doctors, hospitals, and other providers may decide not to treat you, even if you've seen them before. In a medical emergency, doctors, hospitals, and other providers must treat you. For each service you get, make sure to show your plan member card before you get treated. Check with the plan for more information.70 SECTION 4: Medicare Advantage Plans & other options70 Special Needs Plan (SNP) An SNP provides benefits and services to people with specific diseases, certain health care needs, or limited incomes. SNPs tailor their benefits, provider choices, and list of drugs (formularies) to best meet the specific needs of the groups they serve. Can I get my health care from any doctor, other health care provider, or hospital? Some SNPs cover services out of network and some don't. Check with the plan to see if they cover services out of network, and if so, how it affects your costs. Do these plans cover prescription drugs? Yes. All SNPs must provide Medicare drug coverage (Part D). Do I need to choose a primary care doctor? Generally, yes. Do I have to get a referral to see a specialist? In most cases, yes. Certain services, like yearly screening mammograms, don't require a referral. What else do I need to know about this type of plan? These groups are eligible to enroll in an SNP: People who live in certain institutions (like nursing homes) or who live in the community but require nursing care at home (also called an \"Institutional SNP\" or I-SNP). People who are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid (also called a \"Dual Eligible SNP\" or D-SNP). D-SNPs contract with your state Medicaid program to help coordinate your Medicare and Medicaid benefits. People who have specific severe or disabling chronic conditions (like diabetes, End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), HIV/AIDS, chronic heart failure, or dementia) (also called a \"Chronic condition SNP\" or C-SNP). Plans may further limit membership to a single chronic condition or a group of related chronic conditions. An SNP provides benefits targeted to its members' special needs, including care coordination services. Visit Medicare.gov/ plan-compare to find and compare Medicare Advantage Plans . Select \"Special Needs Plans\" to see if an SNP is available in your area. Check with the plan for more information.71 SECTION 4: Medicare Advantage Plans & other options71 You can join, switch, drop, or make changes to your Medicare Advantage Plan Initial Enrollment Period See page 17When you first become eligible for Medicare If you enrolled in a Medicare Advantage Plan during your Initial Enrollment Period, you can change to another Medicare Advantage Plan (with or without drug coverage) or go back to Original Medicare (with or without a separate Medicare drug plan) within the first 3 months you have Medicare. General Enrollment Period See page 18January 1 to March 31If you have Part A coverage and you get Part B for the first time during this period, you can also join a Medicare Advantage Plan. Your coverage will start July 1. Remember, you must have Part A and Part B to join a Medicare Advantage Plan. Open Enrollment PeriodOctober 15 to December 7You can join, switch, or drop a Medicare Advantage Plan during the Open Enrollment Period each year. Your coverage will begin on January 1 (as long as the plan gets your request by December 7). If you join a Medicare Advantage Plan during this period but change your mind, you can switch back to Original Medicare or change to a different Medicare Advantage Plan (depending on which coverage works better for you) during the Medicare Advantage Open Enrollment Period (January 1 - March 31).72 SECTION 4: Medicare Advantage Plans & other options72 Medicare Advantage Open Enrollment PeriodJanuary 1 to March 31If you're in a Medicare Advantage Plan (with or without drug coverage), during this period you can : Switch to another Medicare Advantage Plan (with or without drug coverage). Drop your Medicare Advantage Plan and return to Original Medicare. You'll also be able to join a separate Medicare drug plan. During this period, you can't : Switch from Original Medicare to a Medicare Advantage Plan. Join a separate Medicare drug plan if you're in Original Medicare. Switch from one Medicare drug plan to another if you're in Original Medicare. You can only make one change during this period, and any changes you make will be effective the first of the month after the plan gets your request. If you're returning to Original Medicare and joining a separate Medicare drug plan, you don't need to contact your Medicare Advantage Plan to disenroll. The disenrollment will happen automatically when you join the drug plan. Special Enrollment PeriodQualifying Life EventIn most cases, if you're enrolled in a Medicare Advantage Plan, you must stay enrolled for the calendar year starting the date your coverage begins. However, in certain situations, like if you move or you lose other insurance coverage, you may be able to join, switch, or drop a Medicare Advantage Plan during a Special Enrollment Period. Visit Medicare.gov or check with your plan for more information. 5-star Special Enrollment PeriodDecember 8 to November 30 Note: You can use this Special Enrollment Period only once during this periodMedicare uses star ratings from 1-5 to help you compare plans based on quality and performance. If a Medicare Advantage Plan, Medicare drug plan, or Medicare Cost Plan with a 5-star rating is available in your area, you can use the 5-star Special Enrollment Period to switch from your current Medicare plan to a Medicare plan with a \"5-star\" quality rating. Visit Medicare.gov for more information.73 SECTION 4: Medicare Advantage Plans & other options73 If you drop your Medicare Supplement Insurance ( Medigap ) policy to join a Medicare Advantage Plan , you may not get the same policy back. Rules vary by state and your situation. Also, if you don't drop your Medicare Advantage Plan and return to Original Medicare within 12 months of joining, you may be limited in your ability to get a Medigap policy when you return to Original Medicare. See page 78 . Always review the materials your plan sends you (like the \" Annual Notice of Change\" and \"Evidence of Coverage\"), and make sure your plan will still meet your needs for the following year. You can also visit Medicare.gov/plan-compare to compare other available options with your current plan. Does Medicare offer other types of plans or programs to get health coverage? Yes, some other plans and programs may be offered in your area. Some provide both Hospital (Part A) and Medical (Part B) coverage, while others provide only Part B coverage. Some also provide drug coverage. They have some of the same rules as Medicare Advantage Plans. However, each has special rules and exceptions, so you should contact any plans you're interested in to get more details. Cost Plans Cost Plans are a type of Medicare health plan available in certain, limited areas of the country. In general, you can join even if you only have Part B. If you have Part A and Part B and go to a non-network provider, Original Medicare covers the services. You'll pay the Part A and Part B coinsurance and deductibles . You can join any time the Cost Plan is accepting new members. You can leave any time and return to Original Medicare. You can join a separate Medicare drug plan or you can get drug coverage from the Cost Plan (if offered). Even if the Cost Plan offers drug coverage, you can choose to get drug coverage from a separate Medicare drug plan. Note: You can add or drop drug coverage only at certain times. See pages 80-81 . To see if there are Cost Plans in your area, visit Medicare.gov/plan-compare . You can contact the plan you're interested in for more information. Your State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP) can also help you. See pages 117-120 for the phone number.Important!74 SECTION 4: Medicare Advantage Plans & other options74 Program of All-inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) PACE is a Medicare and Medicaid program offered in many states that allows people who otherwise need a nursing home-level of care to remain in the community, like a home, apartment, or other appropriate setting. To qualify for PACE, you must meet these conditions: You're 55 or older. You live in the service area of a PACE organization. You're certified by your state as needing a nursing home-level of care. At the time you join, you're able to live safely in the community with the help of PACE services. PACE covers all Medicare- and Medicaid-covered care and services, and other services that the PACE team of health care professionals decides are necessary to improve and maintain your health. This includes drugs, as well as any other medically necessary care, like doctor or health care provider visits, transportation, home care, hospital visits, and even nursing home stays when necessary. If you have Medicaid , you won't have to pay a monthly premium for the long-term care portion of the PACE benefit. If you have Medicare but not Medicaid, you'll be charged a monthly premium to cover the long-term care portion of the PACE benefit and a premium for Medicare drug coverage (Part D). However, in PACE, there's never a deductible or copayment for any drug, service, or care approved by the PACE team of health care professionals. Visit Medicare .gov/pace to see if there's a PACE organization that serves your community. Medicare Innovation Projects Medicare develops innovative models, demonstrations , and pilot projects to test and measure the effect of potential changes in Medicare. These projects help to find new ways to improve health care quality and reduce costs. Usually, they operate only for a limited time and for a specific group of people and/or are offered only in specific areas. Examples of current models, demonstrations, and pilot projects include innovations in primary care, care related to specific procedures (like hip and knee replacements), cancer care, and care for people with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). Ask your doctor if they participate in these models, and what it means for your care. To learn more about the current Medicare models, demonstrations, and pilot projects, call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227). TTY users can call 1-877-486-2048.75 75 Note: See pages 121-124 for definitions of blue words. SECTION 5 Medicare Supplement Insurance (Medigap) How does Medigap work? Original Medicare pays for much, but not all, of the cost for covered health care services and supplies. Medicare Supplement Insurance ( Medigap ) policies sold by private companies, can help pay some of the remaining health care costs for covered services and supplies, like copayments , coinsurance , and deductibles . Some Medigap policies also offer coverage for services that Original Medicare doesn't cover, like medical care when you travel outside the U.S. Generally, Medigap doesn't cover long-term care (like care in a nursing home), vision or dental services, hearing aids, eyeglasses, or private-duty nursing. Medigap plans are standardized Medigap must follow federal and state laws designed to protect you, and they must be clearly identified as \"Medicare Supplement Insurance.\" Insurance companies can sell you only a \"standardized\" plan, identified in most states as plans A - D, F, G, and K - N. All plans offer the same basic benefits, but some offer additional benefits so you can choose which one meets your needs. In Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, Medigap plans are standardized in a different way. If you live in one of these states and want more information, visit Medicare.gov or Medicare.gov/publications to view the booklet, \"Choosing a Medigap Policy: A Guide to Health Insurance for People with Medicare.\" Plans C and F are no longer available to people new to Medicare on or after January 1, 2020. However, if you were eligible for Medicare before January 1, 2020, but not yet enrolled, you may be able to buy Plan C or Plan F. People new to Medicare on or after January 1, 2020, have the right to buy Plans D and G instead of Plans C and F. If you're eligible to buy one of these plans, other policies might offer better value. Important!76 SECTION 5: Medicare Supplement Insurance (Medigap) 76 How do I compare Medigap plans? The chart below shows basic information about the different benefits that Medicare Supplement Insurance ( Medigap ) plans cover for 2022. If a percentage appears, the Medigap plan covers that percentage of the benefit, and you're responsible for the rest. Out-of-pocket costs (like deductibles ) might change for 2023. Medigap plans Benefits A B C D F* G* K L M N Medicare Part A coinsurance and hospital costs (up to an additional 365 days after Medicare benefits are 100% Part B excess charges 100% 100% Foreign travel * Plans F and G also offer a high-deductible plan in some states. With this option, you must pay for Medicare-covered costs (coinsurance, copayments, and deductibles) up to the deductible amount of $2,490 in 2022 before your policy pays anything. (You can't buy Plans C and F if you were new to Medicare on or after January 1, 2020. See previous page for more information.) ** For Plans K and L, after you meet your out-of-pocket yearly limit and your yearly Part B deductible ($233 in 2022), the Medigap plan pays 100% of covered services for the rest of the calendar year. ***Plan N pays 100% of the Part B coinsurance. You must pay a copayment of up to $20 for some office visits and up to a $50 copayment for emergency room visits that don't result in an inpatient admission. 77 SECTION 5: Medicare Supplement Insurance (Medigap) 77 What else should I know about Medigap? Before you can buy Medicare Supplement Insurance ( Medigap ), you must have Part A and Part B. You pay the private insurance company a monthly premium for Medigap in addition to the monthly Part B premium you pay to Medicare. Also, if you buy Medigap and a separate Medicare drug plan from the same company, you may need to make 2 separate premium payments. Contact the company to find out how to pay your premiums. A Medigap policy only covers one person. Spouses must buy separate coverage. You can't have drug coverage in both Medigap and your Medicare drug plan. See page 89. It's important to compare Medigap policies since the costs can vary between policies for exactly the same coverage, and may go up as you get older. Some states limit Medigap premium costs. In some states, you may be able to buy another type of Medigap policy called Medicare SELECT. Medicare SELECT is a type of Medigap policy sold in some states that requires you to use hospitals and, in some cases, doctors within its network to be eligible for full insurance benefits (except in an emergency). If you buy Medicare SELECT, you have rights to change your mind within 12 months and switch to standard Medigap. Note: Medigap plans sold to people who are new to Medicare on or after January 1, 2020 aren't allowed to cover the Part B deductible . Because of this, Plans C and F are no longer available to people new to Medicare on or after January 1, 2020. When to buy The best time to buy a Medigap policy is during your Medigap Open Enrollment Period. This 6-month period begins the first month you have Medicare Part B (Medical Insurance), and you're 65 or older. (Some states have additional Open Enrollment Periods.) After this enrollment period, you may not be able to buy Medigap. If you're able to buy Medigap, it may cost more. If you delay enrolling in Part B because you have group health coverage based on your (or your spouse's) current employment, your Medigap Open Enrollment Period won't start until you sign up for Part B. Federal law generally doesn't require insurance companies to sell Medigap to people under 65. If you're under 65, you might not be able to buy the policy you want, or any policy, until you turn 65. However, some states require Medigap insurance companies to sell Medigap policies to people under 65. If you're able to buy one, it may cost more. Check with your State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP) (see pages 117-120 for the phone number of your local SHIP), or your State Insurance Department to learn more about your rights to buy a Medigap policy. A trusted agent or broker may also be able to help.78 SECTION 5: Medicare Supplement Insurance (Medigap) 78 Can I have Medigap and a Medicare Advantage Plan? If you have a Medicare Advantage Plan , it's illegal for anyone to sell you a Medigap policy unless you're switching back to Original Medicare. If you aren't planning to leave your Medicare Advantage Plan, and someone tries to sell you a Medigap policy, report it to your State Insurance Department. If you have Medigap and join a Medicare Advantage Plan, you may want to drop Medigap. You can't use Medigap to pay your Medicare Advantage Plan copayments , deductibles , and premiums because Medicare Advantage Plans provide other protections that Medigap doesn't. If you want to cancel your Medigap policy, contact your insurance company. In most cases, if you drop your Medigap policy to join a Medicare Advantage Plan, you may not be able to get the same policy back. If you join a Medicare Advantage Plan for the first time, and you aren't happy with the plan, you'll have special rights under federal law to buy a Medigap policy and a separate Medicare drug plan if you return to Original Medicare within 12 months of joining the Medicare Advantage Plan. If you had Medigap before you joined, you may be able to get the same policy back if the company still sells it. If it isn't available, you can buy another policy. If you joined a Medicare Advantage Plan when you were first eligible for Medicare (and you aren't happy with the plan), you can choose from any Medigap policy when you switch to Original Medicare within the first year of joining. Some states provide additional special rights to buy a Medigap policy. Note: If you don't drop your Medicare Advantage Plan and return to Original Medicare within 12 months of joining, generally, you must keep your Medicare Advantage Plan for the rest of the year. You can disenroll or change plans during the Open Enrollment Period or if you qualify for a Special Enrollment Period. Depending on the type of Special Enrollment Period, you may or may not have the right to buy a Medigap policy. Where can I get more information? Call your State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP). See pages 117-120 for the phone number. Call your State Insurance Department. Visit Medicare.gov/talk-to-someone or call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227) to get the phone number. TTY users can call 1-877-486-2048.

SECTION 6 Medicare drug coverage (Part D) How does Medicare drug coverage work? Medicare drug coverage (Part D) helps pay for prescription drugs you need. Even if you don't take prescription drugs now, you should consider getting Medicare drug coverage. Medicare drug coverage is optional and is offered to everyone with Medicare. If you decide not to get it when you're first eligible, and you don't have other creditable prescription drug coverage (like drug coverage from an employer or union) or get Extra Help , you'll likely pay a late enrollment penalty if you join a plan later. Generally, you'll pay this penalty for as long as you have Medicare drug coverage (see pages 83-84 ). To get Medicare drug coverage, you must join a Medicare-approved plan that offers drug coverage. Each plan can vary in cost and specific drugs covered. Visit Medicare.gov/plan-compare to find and compare plans in your area. There are 2 ways to get Medicare drug coverage (Part D): 1. Medicare drug plans. These plans add Medicare drug coverage (Part D) to Original Medicare, some Medicare Cost Plans, some Private Fee-for-Service plans, and Medical Savings Account plans. You must have Part A and/or Part B to join a separate Medicare drug plan. 2. Medicare Advantage Plans or other Medicare health plans with drug coverage. You get your Part A, Part B, and Medicare drug coverage (Part D) through these plans. Remember, you must have Part A and Part B to join a Medicare Advantage Plan, and not all of these plans offer drug coverage. In either case, you must live in the service area of the plan you want to join and be lawfully present in the U.S. Both types of plans are called \"Medicare drug coverage\" in this handbook.80 SECTION 6: Medicare drug coverage (Part D)80 If you have employer or union coverage Call your benefits administrator before you make any changes, or sign up for any other coverage. If you sign up for other coverage, you could lose your employer or union health and drug coverage for you and your dependents. If this happens, you may not be able to get your employer or union coverage back. If you want to know how Medicare drug coverage (Part D) works with other drug coverage you may have, see page 88 . When can I join, switch, or drop a plan? You can join, switch, or drop a Medicare drug plan or a Medicare Advantage Plan with drug coverage during these times: Initial Enrollment Period. When you first become eligible for Medicare, you can join a plan. See page 17 . Open Enrollment Period. From October 15 - December 7 each year, you can join, switch, or drop a plan. Your coverage will begin on January 1 (as long as the plan gets your request by December 7). Medicare Advantage Open Enrollment Period. From January 1 - March 31 each year, if you're enrolled in a Medicare Advantage Plan, you can switch to a different Medicare Advantage Plan or switch to Original Medicare (and join a separate Medicare drug plan) once during this time. See page 71 . If you have to pay a premium for Part A and enroll in Part B for the first time during the General Enrollment Period, you can also join a plan from April 1 - June 30. Your coverage will begin on July 1. Special Enrollment Periods Generally, you must stay enrolled in your plan for the entire year. But when certain events happen in your life, like if you move or lose other insurance coverage, you may qualify for a Special Enrollment Period. You may be able make changes to your plan mid-year if you qualify. Check with your plan for more information. How do I switch plans? You can switch to a new Medicare drug plan or Medicare Advantage Plan with drug coverage simply by joining another plan during one of the times listed above. Your old drug coverage will end when your new drug coverage begins. You should get a letter from your new plan telling you when your coverage begins, so you don't need to cancel your old plan. You can switch plans by calling 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227). TTY users can call 1-877-486-2048.Important!81 SECTION 6: Medicare drug coverage (Part D)81 How do I drop my plan? If you want to drop your separate Medicare drug plan or Medicare Advantage Plan with drug coverage and don't want to join a new plan, you can only do so during certain times (see page 80 ). You can disenroll by calling 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227). TTY users can call 1-877-486-2048. You can also send a letter to the plan to tell them you want to disenroll. If you drop your plan and want to join another Medicare drug plan or Medicare health plan with drug coverage later, you have to wait for an enrollment period. You may have to pay a late enrollment penalty if you don't have creditable prescription drug coverage . See pages 83-84 . Read the information you get from your plan Review the \"Evidence of Coverage\" and \"Annual Notice of Change\" your plan sends you each year. The Evidence of Coverage gives you details about what the plan covers, how much you pay, and more. The Annual Notice of Change includes any changes in coverage, costs, provider networks, service area , and more that will be effective in January. If you don't get these important documents in early fall, contact your plan. How much do I pay? Your drug costs will vary based on the plan you choose. Remember, plan coverage and costs can change each year. You may have to pay a premium , deductible , copayments , or coinsurance throughout the year. Learn more about these costs on the next page. Your actual drug coverage costs will vary depending on: Your prescriptions and whether they're on your plan's list of covered drugs (formulary ). See page 85 . What \"tier\" the drug is in. See page 85 . Which drug benefit phase you're in (like whether you've met your deductible, or if you're in the catastrophic coverage phase). See page 83 . Which pharmacy you use (whether it offers preferred or standard cost sharing, is out of network, or is mail order). Your out-of-pocket drug costs may be less at a preferred pharmacy because it has agreed with your plan to charge less. Whether you get Extra Help paying your Medicare drug costs. See page 91 . Cost & coverage: You may be able to lower the cost of your drugs. Some ways include choosing generics over brand name or paying the non-insurance cost of a drug. Ask your pharmacist\u2014they can tell you if there's a less expensive option available. Check with your doctor to make sure the generic option is best for you.82 SECTION 6: Medicare drug coverage (Part D)82 Monthly premium Most drug plans charge a monthly fee that varies by plan. You pay this in addition to the Part B premium . If you're in a Medicare Advantage Plan or a Medicare Cost Plan with drug coverage, the monthly premium may include an amount for drug coverage. Note: Contact your plan (not Social Security or the Railroad Retirement Board (RRB)) if you want your drug premium deducted from your monthly Social Security or RRB payment. If you want to stop premium deductions and get billed directly, contact your plan. If you have a higher income, you might pay more for your Medicare drug coverage. If your income is above a certain limit (in 2022: $91,000 if you file individually or $182,000 if you're married and file jointly), you'll pay an extra amount in addition to your plan premium (sometimes called \"Part D-IRMAA\"). You'll also have to pay this extra amount if you're in a Medicare Advantage Plan that includes drug coverage. This doesn't affect everyone, so most people won't have to pay an extra amount. If you have Part B and you have a higher income, you may also have to pay an extra amount for your Part B premium, even if you don't have Medicare drug coverage (Part D). See page 23 . Usually, the extra amount will be deducted from your Social Security or RRB payment. If Medicare or the RRB bills you for the extra amount instead of deducting it from your Social Security or RRB payment, then you must pay the extra amount to Medicare or the RRB, not your plan. If you don't pay the extra amount, you could lose your Medicare drug coverage (Part D). You may not be able to enroll in another plan right away, and you may have to pay a late enrollment penalty for as long as you have drug coverage. You'll pay Part D-IRMAA payments separately, even if your employer or another third party (like a retirement system) pays your plan premiums. If you have to pay an extra amount and you disagree (for example, you have one or more life changing events that lower your income), visit socialsecurity.gov or call Social Security at 1-800-772-1213. TTY users can call 1-800-325-0778. Yearly deductible This is the amount you must pay before your plan begins to pay its share of your covered drugs. Some plans don't have a deductible . Copayments or coinsurance These are the amounts you pay for your covered drugs after the deductible (if the plan has one). You pay your share and your plan pays its share for covered drugs. If you pay coinsurance , these amounts may vary throughout the year due to changes in the drug's total cost. The amount you pay will also depend on the tier level assigned to your drug. See page 85 . Once you and your plan spend $4,430 combined on drugs (including deductible), you'll generally pay no more than 25% of the cost for prescription drugs until your out-of-pocket spending is $7,050, under the standard drug benefit.Important!83 SECTION 6: Medicare drug coverage (Part D)83 Catastrophic coverage Once your out-of-pocket spending reaches $7,050, you'll automatically get \"catastrophic coverage.\" In most cases, you'll pay no more than 5% of the cost for covered drugs for the rest of the year. Note: If you get Extra Help , you won't have some of these costs. See pages 91-92 . Visit Medicare.gov/plan-compare to get specific Medicare drug plan and Medicare Advantage Plan costs, and call the plans you're interested in to get more details. For help comparing plan costs, contact your State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP). See pages 117-120 for the phone number. What's the Medicare drug coverage (Part D) late enrollment penalty? The late enrollment penalty is an amount that's permanently added to your Medicare drug coverage (Part D) premium . You may owe a late enrollment penalty if at any time after your Initial Enrollment Period is over, there's a period of 63 or more days in a row when you don't have Medicare drug coverage or other creditable prescription drug coverage . You'll generally have to pay the penalty for as long as you have Medicare drug coverage. Note: If you get Extra Help, you don't pay a late enrollment penalty. 3 ways to avoid paying a penalty: 1. Enroll in Medicare drug coverage (Part D) when you're first eligible. Even if you don't take drugs now, you should consider joining a separate Medicare drug plan or a Medicare Advantage Plan with drug coverage to avoid a penalty. You may be able to find a plan that meets your needs with little to no monthly premiums. See pages 5-9 to learn more about your choices. 2. Enroll in Medicare drug coverage (Part D) if you lose other creditable coverage. Creditable prescription drug coverage could include drug coverage from a current or former employer or union, TRICARE, Indian Health Service, the Department of Veterans Affairs, or individual health insurance coverage. Your plan must tell you each year if your non-Medicare drug coverage is creditable coverage. If you go 63 days or more in a row without Medicare drug coverage or other creditable prescription drug coverage, you may have to pay a penalty if you sign up for Medicare drug coverage later. 3. Keep records showing when you had other creditable drug coverage, and tell your plan when they ask about it. If you don't tell your Medicare plan about your previous creditable prescription drug coverage, you may have to pay a penalty for as long as you have Medicare drug coverage. Important!84 SECTION 6: Medicare drug coverage (Part D)84 How much more will I pay for a late enrollment penalty? The cost of the late enrollment penalty depends on how long you didn't have creditable prescription drug coverage. Currently, the late enrollment penalty is calculated by multiplying 1% of the \"national base beneficiary premium\" ($33.37 in 2022) by the number of full, uncovered months that you were eligible but didn't enroll in Medicare drug coverage (Part D) and went without other creditable prescription drug coverage. The final amount is rounded to the nearest $.10 and added to your monthly premium . Since the \"national base beneficiary premium\" may increase each year, the penalty amount may also increase each year. After you enroll in Medicare drug coverage, the plan will tell you if you owe a penalty and what your premium will be. Example: Mrs. Martinez is currently eligible for Medicare, and her Initial Enrollment Period ended on May 31, 2018. She doesn't have prescription drug coverage from any other source. She didn't join by May 31, 2018, and instead joined during the Open Enrollment Period that ended December 7, 2020. Her drug coverage was effective January 1, 2021. 2021 Since Mrs. Martinez was without creditable prescription drug coverage from June 2018-December 2020, her penalty in 2021 was 31% (1% for each of the 31 months) of $33.06 (the national base beneficiary premium for 2021) or $10.25. Since the monthly penalty is always rounded to the nearest $0.10, she paid $10.30 each month in addition to her plan's monthly premium. Here's the math:.31 (31% base rounded the nearest $0.10 = $10.30 $10.30 = Mrs. Martinez's monthly late enrollment penalty for 2021 2022 In 2022, Medicare recalculated Mrs. Martinez's penalty using the 2022 base beneficiary premium ($33.37). So, Mrs. Martinez's new monthly penalty in 2022 is 31% of $33.37, or $10.34 each month. Since the monthly penalty is always rounded to the nearest $0.10, she pays $10.30 each month in addition to her plan's monthly premium. Here's the math:.31 (31% base rounded the nearest $0.10 = $10.30 $10.30 = Mrs. Martinez's monthly late enrollment penalty for 2022 What if I don't agree with the late enrollment penalty? Your Medicare drug plan or Medicare Advantage Plan with drug coverage will send you a letter stating you have to pay a late enrollment penalty. If you disagree with your penalty, you can request a review (generally within 60 days from the date on the letter). Fill out the \"reconsideration request form\" you get with your letter by the date listed in the letter. You can provide proof that supports your case, like information about previous creditable prescription drug coverage. If you need help, call your plan. 85 SECTION 6: Medicare drug coverage (Part D)85 Which drugs are covered? All plans must cover a wide range of prescription drugs that people with Medicare take, including most drugs in certain \"protected classes,\" like drugs to treat cancer or HIV/AIDS. Information about a plan's list of covered drugs (called a \" formulary \") isn't included in this handbook because each plan has its own formulary. A Medicare drug plan can make some changes to its drug list during the year if it follows guidelines set by Medicare. Your plan may change its drug list during the year because drug therapies change, new drugs are released, or new medical information becomes available. Your plan may raise the copayment or coinsurance you pay for a particular brand name drug or generic drug when the manufacturer raises the price, or when a plan starts to offer a generic form of a brand name drug, but you continue to take the brand name drug. Many Medicare drug plans and Medicare health plans with drug coverage place drugs into different levels called \"tiers\" on their formularies. Drugs in each tier have a different cost. For example, a drug in a lower tier will generally cost you less than a drug in a higher tier. Check with the plan to see if a drug is covered for your health condition. A plan may cover a drug for one condition but not another. What happens if my drug is in a higher tier? In some cases, if your drug is in a higher tier and your prescriber (your doctor or other health care provider who's legally allowed to write prescriptions) thinks you need that drug instead of a similar drug in a lower tier, you or your prescriber can ask your plan for an exception to get a lower coinsurance or copayment for the drug in the higher tier. See page 100 for more information on exceptions. Plans can change their formularies at any time. Your plan may notify you of any formulary changes that affect drugs you're taking. Note: Medicare drug coverage (Part D) includes drugs for medication- assisted treatment for opioid use disorders. It also covers drugs like methadone and buprenorphine when prescribed for pain. However, Medicare Part A covers methadone when used to treat an opioid use disorder as an inpatient in a hospital, and Part B now covers methadone when you receive it through an opioid treatment program. See page 47 for more information about opioid treatment programs. Contact the plan for its current formulary, or visit the plan's website. You can also visit Medicare.gov/plan-compare or call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227). TTY users can call 1-877-486-2048. Each month you fill a prescription, your plan mails you an \"Explanation of Benefits\" notice. Review your notice and check it for mistakes. Contact your plan if you have questions or find mistakes. If you suspect fraud, call the Medicare Drug Integrity Contractor at 1-877-7SAFERX (1-877-772-3379). See page 106 . Important!86 SECTION 6: Medicare drug coverage (Part D)86 Plans may have coverage rules for certain drugs Prior authorization: You and/or your prescriber must contact your plan before you can fill certain prescriptions. Your prescriber may need to show that the drug is medically necessary for the plan to cover it. Plans may also use prior authorization when they cover a drug for only certain medical conditions it is approved for, but not others. When this occurs, plans will likely have alternative drugs on their list of covered drugs (formulary ) for the other medical conditions the drug is approved to treat. Quantity limits: Limits on how much medicine you can get at a time. Step therapy: You may need to try one or more similar, lower-cost drugs before the plan will cover the prescribed drug. Prescription safety checks at the pharmacy (including opioid pain medicine): Before the pharmacy fills your prescriptions, your Medicare drug plan and pharmacy perform additional safety checks, like checking for drug interactions and incorrect dosages. These safety checks also include checking for possible unsafe amounts of opioids, limiting the days supply of a first prescription for opioids, and use of opioids at the same time as benzodiazepines (commonly used for anxiety and sleep). Opioid pain medicine (like oxycodone and hydrocodone) can help with certain types of pain, but have risks and side effects (like addiction, overdose, and death). These can increase when you take opioids with certain other drugs, like benzodiazepines, anti-seizure medications, gabapentin, muscle relaxers, certain antidepressants, and drugs for sleeping problems. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions about risks or side effects. Drug Management Programs: Medicare drug plans and health plans with drug coverage have a program in place to help you use these opioids and benzodiazepines safely. If your opioid use could be unsafe, for example due to getting opioid prescriptions from multiple doctors or pharmacies, or if you had a recent overdose from opioids, your plan will contact the doctors who prescribed them for you to make sure they're medically necessary and you're using them appropriately. If your plan decides your use of prescription opioids and benzodiazepines may not be safe, the plan will send you a letter in advance. This letter will tell you if the plan will limit coverage of these drugs for you, or if you'll be required to get the prescriptions for these drugs only from one doctor or pharmacy you select. You and your doctor have the right to appeal these limitations if you disagree with the plan's decision (see page 99 ). The letter will also tell you how to contact the plan if you have questions or would like to appeal. Prescription safety checks at the pharmacy and Drug Management Programs generally don't apply if you have cancer or sickle cell disease, are getting palliative or end-of-life care, are in hospice, or live in a long-term care facility. If you or your prescriber believe that your plan should waive one of these coverage rules, you can ask for an exception. See page 100. 87 SECTION 6: Medicare drug coverage (Part D)87 Important tips if you're prescribed opioids: Opioid medications can be an important part of pain management, but they also can have serious health risks if misused. Talk with your doctor about having naloxone at home. Medicare covers naloxone, a drug that your doctor may prescribe as a safety measure in case you need to rapidly reverse the effects of an opioid overdose. Talk with your doctor about your dosage and the length of time you'll be taking them. You and your doctor may decide later you don't need to take all of your prescription. Talk with your doctor about other options that Medicare covers to treat your pain, like non-opioid medications and devices, physical therapy, acupuncture for lower back pain, individual and group therapy, behavioral health integration services, and more. Never take more opioids than prescribed. Also, talk with your doctor about any other pain medicines you're taking. Safely store and dispose of unused prescription opioids through your community drug take-back program or your pharmacy mail-back program. For more information on safe and effective pain management and opioid use, visit Medicare.gov/coverage/pain-management or call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227). TTY users can call 1-877-486-2048. Do you get automatic prescription refills in the mail? Some people with Medicare get their drugs through an \"automatic refill\" service that automatically delivers prescription drugs before they run out. To make sure you still need a prescription before they send you a refill, drug plans may offer a voluntary auto-ship program. Contact your plan for more information. Medication Therapy Management program Plans with Medicare drug coverage (Part D) must offer free Medication Therapy Management services if you meet certain requirements or are in a program to help members use their opioids safely. If you qualify, you can get these services to help you understand how to manage and use drugs safely. Medication Therapy Management services usually include a discussion with a pharmacist or health care provider to review your medications. These services may vary in some plans. The pharmacist or health care provider may talk with you about: How well your medications are working and any problems you're having Whether your medications have side effects If there might be interactions between the drugs you're taking Whether you can get lower costs How to safely dispose of unused medications Contact your plan for specific details and to see if you're eligible for a Medication Therapy Management program. Or, visit Medicare.gov/plan-compare to find and compare health and drug plans. 88 SECTION 6: Medicare drug coverage (Part D)88 Part D Senior Savings Model You may be able to get Medicare drug coverage that gives supplemental benefits specifically for insulin. The Part D Senior Savings Model is available to all people with Medicare. Plans that participate in this model will offer coverage choices that include multiple types of insulin at a maximum copayment of $35 for a month's supply. (The $35 maximum copayment doesn't apply during the catastrophic phase of Medicare drug plan coverage.) If you're getting full Extra Help , your copayment for insulin is less than $35 outside of the model. How do other insurance and programs work with Medicare drug coverage (Part D)? Medicaid If you have Medicare and full Medicaid coverage, Medicare covers your prescription drugs. Medicaid may still cover some drugs that Medicare doesn't cover. Note: You automatically qualify for Extra Help if you have Medicare and Medicaid. See page 92 . Employer or union health coverage This is health coverage from your, your spouse's, or other family member's current or former employer or union. If you have drug coverage based on your current or previous employment, your employer or union will notify you each year to let you know if your drug coverage is creditable. Keep the information you get. Call your benefits administrator for more information before making any changes to your coverage. Note: If you get Medicare drug coverage, you, your spouse, or your dependents may lose your employer or union health coverage. COBRA This is a federal law that may allow you to temporarily keep employer or union health coverage after the employment ends or after you lose coverage as a dependent of the covered employee. There may be reasons why you should take Part B instead of, or in addition to, COBRA coverage (see page 18 ). However, if you take COBRA and it includes creditable prescription drug coverage , you'll have a Special Enrollment Period to get Medicare drug coverage (Part D) without paying a penalty when the COBRA coverage ends. Talk with your State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP) to see if COBRA is a good choice for you. See pages 117-120 for the phone number. If you have questions about Medicare and COBRA, call the Benefits Coordination & Recovery Center at 1-855-798-2627. TTY users can call 1-855-797-2627.89 SECTION 6: Medicare drug coverage (Part D)89 Medicare Supplement Insurance (Medigap) with drug coverage Medigap policies can no longer be sold with drug coverage, but if you currently have Medigap with drug coverage, you can keep it. You may choose to join a separate Medicare drug plan because most Medigap drug coverage isn't creditable, and you may pay more if you join a drug plan later. See page 82 . You can't have drug coverage in both Medigap and your Medicare drug plan. If you join a separate Medicare drug plan, tell your Medigap insurance company so they can remove the drug coverage and adjust your premiums . Call your Medigap insurance company for more information. Note: Keep any creditable prescription drug coverage information you get from your plan. You may need it if you decide to join a separate Medicare drug plan later. Don't send creditable coverage letters or certificates to Medicare. How does other government insurance work with Medicare drug coverage (Part D)? The types of insurance listed below are all considered creditable prescription drug coverage. In most cases, it's to your advantage to keep this coverage if you have it. Federal Employee Health Benefits Program (FEHB) This is health coverage for current and retired federal employees and covered family members. These plans usually include creditable prescription drug coverage, so you don't need to get Medicare drug coverage (Part D). However, if you decide to get Medicare drug coverage, you can keep your FEHB plan, and in most cases, the Medicare plan will pay first. For more information, visit opm.gov/healthcare-insurance/healthcare , or call the Office of Personnel Management at 1-888-767-6738. TTY users can call 1-800-877-8339. If you're an active federal employee, contact your Benefits Officer. Visit apps.opm.gov/abo for a list of Benefits Officers. You can also call your plan if you have questions. Veterans' benefits This is health coverage for veterans and people who have served in the U.S. military. You may be able to get drug coverage through the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) program. You may join a separate Medicare drug plan, but if you do, you can't use both types of coverage for the same drug at the same time. For more information, visit va.gov or call the VA at 1-800-827-1000. TTY users can call 711.90 SECTION 6: Medicare drug coverage (Part D)90 CHAMPVA (Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs) This is a comprehensive health care program in which the Department of Veterans Affairs shares the cost of covered health care services and supplies with eligible beneficiaries. You may join a separate Medicare drug plan, but if you do, you won't be able to use the Meds by Mail program which can give your maintenance drugs to you at no charge (no premiums , deductibles , and copayments ). For more information, visit va.gov/communitycare/programs/dependents/champva/ or call CHAMPVA at 1-800-733-8387. TRICARE (military health benefits) This is a health care plan for active-duty service members, military retirees, and their families. Most people with TRICARE entitled to Part A must have Part B to keep TRICARE drug benefits . If you have TRICARE, you don't need to join a separate Medicare drug plan. However, if you do, your Medicare drug plan pays first, and TRICARE pays second. If you join a Medicare Advantage Plan with drug coverage, your Medicare Advantage Plan and TRICARE may coordinate their benefits if your Medicare Advantage Plan network pharmacy is also a TRICARE network pharmacy. Otherwise, you can file your own claim to get paid back for your out-of-pocket costs. For more information, visit tricare.mil , or call the TRICARE Pharmacy Program at 1-877-363-1303. TTY users can call 1-877-540-6261. Indian Health Service (IHS) The IHS is the primary health care provider to the American Indian/Alaska Native Medicare population. The Indian health care system, consisting of tribal, urban, and federally operated IHS health programs, delivers a spectrum of clinical and preventive health services through a network of hospitals, clinics, and other entities. Many Indian health facilities participate in the Medicare drug program (Part D). If you get drugs through an Indian health facility, you'll continue to get drugs at no cost to you, and your coverage won't be interrupted. Joining a Medicare drug plan or Medicare Advantage Plan with drug coverage may help your Indian health facility because the plan pays the Indian health facility for the cost of your drugs. Talk to your local Indian health benefits coordinator who can help you choose a plan that meets your needs and tell you how Medicare works with the Indian health care system. Note: If you're getting care through an IHS or tribal health facility or program without being charged, you can continue to do so for some or all of your care. Getting Medicare doesn't affect your ability to get services through the IHS and tribal health facilities.91 91 Note: See pages 121-124 for definitions of blue words. SECTION 7 Get help paying your health & drug costs Get Extra Help paying your Medicare drug costs If you have limited income and resources, you may qualify for help to pay for some health care and drug coverage costs. Extra Help is a program to help people with limited income and resources pay Medicare drug costs. You may qualify for Extra Help if your yearly income and resources are below these limits in 2021: Yearly income Other resources Single person less than $19,320 less than $14,790 Married person living with a spouse and no other dependentsless than $26,130 less than $29,520 These amounts may change in 2022. You may qualify even if you have a higher income (like if you still work, live in Alaska or Hawaii, or have dependents living with you). Resources include money in a checking or savings account, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs). Resources don't include your home, car, household items, burial plot, up to $1,500 for burial expenses (per person), or life insurance policies. If you qualify for Extra Help and join a separate Medicare drug plan or Medicare Advantage Plan with Medicare drug coverage (Part D): You'll get help paying your drug coverage costs. You won't pay a late enrollment penalty. Note: Extra Help isn't available in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, or American Samoa. See page 96 for information about programs available in those areas.92 SECTION 7: Get help paying your health & drug costs92 Cost & coverage: Most people with Medicare can only make changes to their drug coverage at certain times of the year. If you have Medicaid or receive Extra Help , you may be able to make changes to your coverage one time during each of these periods: January - March April - June July - September If you make a change, it will begin the first day of the following month. You'll have to wait for the next period to make another change. You can't use this Special Enrollment Period October - December. However, all people with Medicare can make changes to their coverage October 15 - December 7. The changes will begin on January 1. You automatically qualify for Extra Help if you have Medicare and meet any of these conditions: You have full Medicaid coverage. You get help from your state Medicaid program paying your Part B premiums (in a Medicare Savings Program). See pages 94-96 . You get Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits. Medicare will mail you a purple letter to let you know you automatically qualify for Extra Help. Keep this for your records. You don't need to apply for Extra Help if you get this letter. If you don't already have Medicare drug coverage (Part D), you must get it to use this Extra Help. If you don't have drug coverage, Medicare may enroll you in a separate Medicare drug plan so that you'll be able to use the Extra Help. If Medicare enrolls you in a plan, you'll get a yellow or green letter letting you know when your coverage begins, and you'll have a Special Enrollment Period to change plans if you want to enroll in a different plan than the one Medicare enrolled you in. Different plans cover different drugs. Check to see if the plan you're enrolled in covers the drugs you use and if you can go to the pharmacies you want. Visit Medicare.gov/plan-compare or call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227) to compare your plan with other plans in your area. TTY users can call 1-877-486-2048. If you have Medicaid and live in certain institutions (like a nursing home) or get home- and community-based services, you pay nothing for your covered drugs. 93 SECTION 7: Get help paying your health & drug costs93 If you don't want to join a separate Medicare drug plan (for example, because you want only your employer or union coverage), call the plan listed in your letter, or call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227). TTY users can call 1-877-486-2048. Tell them you don't want to be in a Medicare drug plan (you want to \"opt out\"). If you continue to qualify for Extra Help or if your employer or union coverage is creditable prescription drug coverage , you won't have to pay a penalty if you join later. If you have employer or union coverage and you get Medicare drug coverage (Part D), you may lose your employer or union coverage (for you and your dependents) even if you qualify for Extra Help. Call your employer's benefits administrator before you get Medicare drug coverage. Drug costs in 2022 for people who qualify are generally no more than $3.95 for each generic drug and $9.85 for each brand-name drug. Look on the Extra Help letters you get, or contact your plan to find out your exact costs. If you didn't automatically qualify for Extra Help, you can apply any time: Visit socialsecurity.gov/i1020 to apply online. Call Social Security at 1-800-772-1213. TTY users can call 1-800-325-0778. Note: When you apply for Extra Help, you can also begin the application process for a Medicare Savings Program. These state programs provide help with other Medicare costs. Social Security will send information to your state unless you tell them not to on the Extra Help application. To get answers to your questions about Extra Help and help choosing drug coverage, call your State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP). See pages 117-120 for the phone number. You can also call 1-800-MEDICARE.Important!94 SECTION 7: Get help paying your health & drug costs94 What if I need help paying for my Medicare health care costs? Medicare Savings Programs If you have limited income and resources, you may be able to get help from your state to pay your Medicare costs if you meet certain conditions. There are 4 kinds of Medicare Savings Programs: 1. Qualified Medicare Beneficiary (QMB) Program: If you're eligible, the QMB Program helps pay for Part A and/or Part B premiums. In addition, Medicare providers aren't allowed to bill you for services and items Medicare covers, including deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments. If you get a bill for these charges, tell your provider or the debt collector that you're in the QMB Program and can't be charged for Medicare deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments. If you've already made payments on a bill for services and items Medicare covers, you have the right to a refund. If you're enrolled in a Medicare Advantage Plan, you should also contact the plan to ask them to stop the charges. In some cases, you may be billed a small copayment through Medicaid, if one applies. Note: To make sure your provider knows you're in the QMB Program, show both your Medicare and Medicaid or QMB card each time you get care. If you have Original Medicare, you can also give your provider a copy of your \"Medicare Summary Notice\" (MSN). Your MSN will show you're in the QMB Program and shouldn't be billed. Log into (or create) your secure Medicare account at Medicare.gov at any time to sign up to get your MSNs electronically. If your provider won't stop billing you, call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227). TTY users can call 1-877-486-2048. We can also confirm that you're in the QMB Program. 2. Specified Low-Income Medicare Beneficiary (SLMB) Program: Helps pay Part B premiums only. 3. Qualifying Individual (QI) Program: Helps pay Part B premiums only. Applications are granted on a first come, first-served basis. 4. Qualified Disabled and Working Individuals (QDWI) Program: Helps pay Part A premiums only. You may qualify for this program if you have a disability, you're working, and you lost your Social Security disability benefits and premium-free Part A because you returned to work. If you qualify for a QMB, SLMB, or QI Program, you automatically qualify to get Extra Help paying for Medicare drug coverage (Part D). See pages 91-93 . The names of these programs and how they work may vary by state. Medicare Savings Programs aren't available in Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin Islands. How do I qualify? In most cases, to qualify for a Medicare Savings Program, you must have income and resources below a certain limit. Important!95 SECTION 7: Get help paying your health & drug costs95 States have different limits and ways of counting your income and resources, so you should check with your state Medicaid office to see if you qualify. For more information Call or visit your Medicaid office (State Medical Assistance Office), and ask for information about Medicare Savings Programs. Visit Medicare.gov/talk-to-someone to get the phone number for your state's Medicaid office. First, choose your state from the drop-down under \"What state do you live in?\" and then click \"Go.\" You'll be taken to a page with contact information that's specific for your state. Then, in the left hand column of that page, choose \"Other insurance programs.\" Find \"Medicaid program\" in the list of options under \"Topics: Other insurance programs.\" You can also call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227) to get the phone number for your state's Medicaid office. TTY users can call 1-877-486-2048. Contact your State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP). See pages 117-120 for the phone number. Medicaid Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that helps pay health care costs if you have limited income and (in some cases) resources and meet other requirements. Some people qualify for both Medicare and Medicaid. What does Medicaid cover? If you have Medicare and full Medicaid coverage, most of your health care costs are covered. You can get your Medicare coverage through Original Medicare or a Medicare Advantage Plan . If you have Medicare and full Medicaid coverage, Medicare covers your prescription drugs. You automatically qualify for Extra Help paying your Medicare drug costs (see page 91 ). Medicaid may still cover some drugs that Medicare doesn't cover. People with full Medicaid coverage may get coverage for services that Medicare doesn't cover or only partially covers, like nursing home care, personal care, transportation to medical services, home- and community-based services, and dental, vision, and hearing services. How do I qualify? Medicaid programs vary from state to state. They may also have different names, like \"Medical Assistance\" or \"Medi-Cal.\" Each state has different income and resource requirements. Call your Medicaid office for more information and to see if you qualify. Visit Medicare.gov/talk-to-someone or call 1-800-MEDICARE. Medicare-Medicaid Plans Medicare is working with some states and health plans to offer demonstration plans for certain people who have both Medicare and Medicaid and make it easier for them to get the services they need. They're called Medicare-Medicaid Plans. These plans include drug coverage and are only in certain states. If you're interested in joining a Medicare-Medicaid Plan, visit Medicare.gov/plan-compare to see if one is available in your area. 96 SECTION 7: Get help paying your health & drug costs96 State Pharmacy Assistance Program Many states have State Pharmacy Assistance Programs that help certain people pay for prescription drugs based on financial need, age, or medical condition. To find out if there's a State Pharmacy Assistance Program in your state and how it works, call your State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP). See pages 117-120 for the phone number. You can also visit Medicare .gov/pharmaceutical-assistance-program/#state-programs . Pharmaceutical Assistance Programs (also called Patient Assistance Programs) Many major drug manufacturers offer assistance programs for people with Medicare drug coverage (Part D) who meet certain requirements. Visit Medicare.gov/pharmaceutical-assistance-program to learn more about Pharmaceutical Assistance Programs. Program of All-inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) PACE is a Medicare and Medicaid program offered in many states that allows people who need a nursing home-level of care to remain in the community. See page 74 . Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits SSI is a cash benefit Social Security pays to people with limited income and resources who are blind, 65 or older, or have a disability. These benefits aren't the same as Social Security retirement benefits. You may be able to get both SSI and Social Security benefits at the same time if your Social Security benefit is less than the SSI benefit amount, due to a limited work history, a history of low-wage work, or both. If you're eligible for SSI, you automatically qualify for Extra Help , and are usually eligible for Medicaid. You can visit benefits.gov/ssa , and use the \"Benefit Eligibility Screening Tool\" to find out if you're eligible for SSI or other benefits. Call Social Security at 1-800-772-1213 or contact your local Social Security office for more information. TTY users can call 1-800-325-0778. Note: People who live in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, or American Samoa can't get SSI. Programs for people who live in the U.S. territories There are programs in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa to help people with limited income and resources pay their Medicare costs. Programs vary in these areas. Call your Medicaid office (State Medical Assistance Office) to learn more. Visit Medicare.gov/talk-to-someone or call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227) to get the phone number. TTY users can call 1-877-486-2048.9797 Note: See pages 121-124 for definitions of blue words. SECTION 8 Know your rights & protect yourself from fraud What are my Medicare rights? All people with Medicare have certain rights and protections. You have the right to: Be treated with courtesy, dignity, and respect at all times. Be protected from discrimination. Have personal and health information kept private. Get information in a way you understand from Medicare, health care providers, and, under certain circumstances, contractors. Learn about your treatment choices in clear language you can understand, and participate in treatment decisions. Get Medicare information and health care services in a language you understand. Get your Medicare information in an accessible format, like braille or large print. See \"CMS Accessible Communications\" on page 107 . Note: If you need plan information in a language other than English or in an accessible format, contact your plan. Get answers to your Medicare questions. Have access to doctors, specialists, and hospitals for medically necessary services. Get Medicare-covered services in an emergency. Get a decision about health care payment, coverage of items and services, or drug coverage. When you or your provider files a claim, you'll get a notice letting you know what will and won't be covered. This notice comes from one of these: Medicare Your Medicare Advantage Plan (Part C) or other Medicare health plan Your Medicare drug plan for Medicare drug coverage (Part D) If you disagree with the decision of your claim, you have the right to file an appeal.98 SECTION 8: Know your rights & protect yourself from fraud98 Request a review (appeal) of certain decisions about health care payment, coverage of items and services, or drug coverage. Be able to file complaints (sometimes called \"grievances\"), including complaints about the quality of your care. You can file a complaint if you have concerns about the quality of care and other services you get from a Medicare provider. Visit Medicare .gov or call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227) to learn more about filing a complaint. TTY users can call 1-877-486-2048. What are my rights if my plan stops participating in Medicare? Medicare health and drug plans can decide not to participate in Medicare for the coming year. In these cases, your coverage under the plan will end after December 31. Your plan will send you a letter explaining your options. If this happens: You can choose another plan between October 15-December 7. Your coverage will begin January 1. You'll also have a special right to join another Medicare plan until the last day in February. You may have the right to buy certain Medigap policies within 63 days after your plan coverage ends. What's an appeal? An appeal is the action you can take if you disagree with a coverage or payment decision by Medicare or your Medicare plan. For example, you can appeal if Medicare or your plan denies: A request for a health care service, supply, item, or drug you think Medicare should cover. A request for payment of a health care service, supply, item, or drug you already got. A request to change the amount you must pay for a health care service, supply, item, or drug. You can also appeal: If Medicare or your plan stops providing or paying for all or part of a health care service, supply, item, or drug you think you still need. An at-risk determination made under a drug management program that limits access to coverage for frequently abused drugs, like opioids and benzodiazepines. See page 86 . If you decide to file an appeal, you can ask your doctor, supplier, or other health care provider for any information that may help your case. This will make your appeal stronger. Keep a copy of everything related to your appeal, including what you send to Medicare or your plan. 99 SECTION 8: Know your rights & protect yourself from fraud99 How do I file an appeal? How you file an appeal depends on the type of Medicare coverage you have. If you have Original Medicare Get the \" Medicare Summary Notice\" (MSN) that shows the item or service you're appealing. See page 59 for more information about MSNs. Circle the item(s) on the MSN you disagree with. Write an explanation of why you disagree with the decision. You can write on the MSN or on a separate piece of paper and attach it to the MSN. Include your name, phone number, and Medicare Number on the MSN. Keep a copy for your records. Send the MSN, or a copy, to the company that handles bills for Medicare (Medicare Administrative Contractor) listed on the MSN. You can include any other additional information you have about your appeal, like information from your health care provider. Or, you can use CMS Form 20027. To view or print this form, visit CMS.gov/cmsforms/downloads/cms20027 .pdf, or call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227) to have a copy mailed to you. TTY users can call 1-877-486-2048. You must file your appeal by the date in the MSN. If you missed the deadline for appealing, you may still file an appeal and get a decision if you can show good cause for missing the deadline. You'll generally get a decision from the Medicare Administrative Contractor within 60 days after they get your request. If Medicare will cover the item(s) or service(s), it will be listed on your next MSN. You may have the right to a fast appeal if you think your Medicare services from a hospital or other facility are ending too soon. See page 100. If you have a Medicare Advantage or other Medicare health plan The timeframe for filing an appeal may be different than Original Medicare. To learn more, look at the materials your plan sends you, call your plan, or visit Medicare.gov/claims-appeals/how-do-i-file-an-appeal . In some cases, you can file a fast appeal. See materials from your plan and page 100. If you have a separate Medicare drug plan You have the right to do all of these (even before you buy a certain drug): Get a written explanation for drug coverage decisions (called a \" coverage determination\") from your Medicare drug plan. A coverage determination is the first decision your Medicare drug plan (not the pharmacy) makes about your benefits. This can be a decision about if your drug is covered, if you met the plan's requirements to cover the drug, or how much you pay for the drug. You'll also get a coverage determination decision if you ask your plan to make an exception to its rules to cover your drug. Ask for an exception if you or your prescriber (your doctor or other health care provider who's legally allowed to write prescriptions) believes you need a drug that isn't on your plan's list of covered drugs ( formulary ). Ask for an exception if you or your prescriber believes that your plan should waive a coverage rule (like prior authorization). 100 SECTION 8: Know your rights & protect yourself from fraud100 Ask for an exception if you think you should pay less for a higher tier drug because you or your prescriber believe you can't take any of the lower tier drugs for the same condition. How do I ask for a coverage determination or exception? You or your prescriber must contact your plan to ask for a coverage determination or an exception. If your network pharmacy can't fill a prescription, the pharmacist will give you a notice that explains how to contact your Medicare drug plan so you can make your request. If the pharmacist doesn't give you this notice, ask for a copy. If you're asking for drug benefits you haven't gotten yet, you or your prescriber may make a standard request or an expedited (fast) request by phone or in writing. If you're asking to get paid back for prescription drugs you already bought, your plan can require you or your prescriber to make the standard request in writing. You or your prescriber can call or write your plan for an expedited (fast) request. Your request will be expedited if you haven't gotten the prescription and your plan determines, or your prescriber tells your plan, that your life or health may be at risk by waiting. If you're requesting an exception, your prescriber must provide a statement explaining the medical reason why your plan should approve the exception. What are my rights if I think my services are ending too soon? If you're getting Medicare services from a hospital, skilled nursing facility , home health agency, comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation facility, or hospice, and you think your Medicare-covered services are ending too soon (or that you're being discharged too soon), you can ask for a fast appeal (also known as an \"immediate appeal\" or an \"expedited appeal\"). Your provider will give you a notice called a Notice of Medicare Non Coverage before your services end telling you how to ask for a fast appeal. You should read this notice carefully. If you don't get this notice, ask your provider for it. With a fast appeal, an independent reviewer will decide if your covered services should continue. You can contact your Beneficiary and Family Centered Care-Quality Improvement Organization for help with filing an appeal. See page 115 . A fast appeal only covers the decision to end services. You may need to start a separate appeals process for any items or services you may have received after the decision to end services. Visit Medicare.gov/publications to view the booklet, \"Medicare Appeals.\" How can I get help filing an appeal? You can appoint a representative to help you. Your representative can be a family member, friend, advocate, attorney, financial advisor, doctor, or someone else who will act on your behalf. For more information, visit Medicare.gov/claims-appeals/how-do-i-file-an-appeal . You can also get help filing an appeal from your State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP). See pages 117-120 for the phone number. Important!101 SECTION 8: Know your rights & protect yourself from fraud101 What's an \"Advance Beneficiary Notice of Noncoverage\" (ABN)? If you have Original Medicare, your doctor, other health care provider, or supplier may give you a notice called an \"Advance Beneficiary Notice of Noncoverage\" (ABN) if they think Medicare doesn't cover the care they'll provide. This notice says Medicare probably (or certainly) won't pay for some services in certain situations. What happens if I get an ABN? You'll be asked to choose whether to get the items or services listed on the notice. If you choose to get the items or services listed on the notice, you're agreeing to pay if Medicare doesn't. You'll be asked to sign the notice to say that you've read and understood it. Doctors, other health care providers, and suppliers don't have to (but still may) give you a notice for services that Medicare never covers. See page 55 . An ABN isn't an official denial of coverage by Medicare. If Medicare denies payment, you can still file an appeal once you receive the \"Medicare Summary Notice\" (MSN) showing the item or service in question. However, you'll have to pay for the items or services if Medicare decides that the items or services aren't covered (and no other insurer is responsible for payment). Can I get an ABN for other reasons? You may get a \"Skilled Nursing Facility ABN\" when the facility believes Medicare will no longer cover your stay or other items and services. You may get an ABN if you're getting an off-the-shelf back or knee brace that's included in the DMEPOS Competitive Bidding Program and the supplier isn't a contract supplier. What if I didn't get an ABN? If your provider was required to give you this notice but didn't, in most cases, your provider must give you a refund for what you paid for the item or service. Where can I get more information about appeals and the ABN? Visit Medicare.gov/claims-appeals/how-do-i-file-an-appeal . Visit Medicare.gov/publications to view the booklet, \"Medicare Appeals.\" If you're in a Medicare plan , call your plan to see if it covers a service or item. Note: If you have a Medicare Advantage Plan , you have the right to ask the plan in advance if it covers a certain service, drug, or supply. Contact your plan to request and submit a pre-service organization determination. The plan's response will include instructions to file a timely appeal, if you want one. You also may get plan directed care. This is when a plan provider refers you for a service or to a provider outside the network without getting an organization determination in advance. See page 65 .102 SECTION 8: Know your rights & protect yourself from fraud102 Your right to access your personal health information By law, you or your legal representative generally has the right to view and/or get copies of your personal health information from health care providers who treat you, or by health plans that pay for your care, including Medicare. In most cases, you also have the right to have a provider or plan send copies of your information to a third party that you choose, like other providers who treat you, a family member, a researcher, or a mobile app you use to manage your personal health information. This includes: Claims and billing records Information related to your enrollment in health plans, including Medicare Medical and case management records (except psychotherapy notes) Any other records that have information that doctors or health plans use to make decisions about you You may have to fill out a health information \"request\" form, and pay a cost-based fee for copies. Your providers or plans should tell you about the fee when you make the request. If they don't, you should ask. The fee can only be for the labor to make the copies, copying supplies, and postage (if needed). In most cases, you shouldn't be charged for viewing, searching, downloading, or sending your information through an electronic portal. Generally, you can get your information on paper or electronically. If your providers or plans store your information electronically, they generally must give you electronic copies, if that's your preference. You have the right to get your information in a timely manner, but it may take up to 30 days to fill the request. For more information, visit hhs.gov/hipaa/for-individuals/guidance- materials-for-consumers . If you need help getting and using your health records, the Office of the National Coordinator (ONC) in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) created \"The Guide to Getting & Using Your Health Records.\" This guide can help you through the process of getting your health records and show you how to make sure your records are accurate and complete, so you can get the most out of your health care.

Compare the quality of Medicare health & drug plans When you visit Medicare.gov/plan-compare to find and compare health and drug plans, you'll see a star rating system for Medicare health and drug plans. The overall star rating gives an overall rating of the plan's quality and performance for the types of services each plan offers. For plans that cover health services, this is a summary rating of health plan quality for many medical/health care services that fall into 5 categories and includes: 1. Staying healthy\u2014screenings, tests, and vaccines: Whether members got various screenings, tests, vaccines, and other check-ups to help them stay healthy. 2. Managing chronic (long-term) conditions: How often members with certain conditions got recommended tests and treatments to help manage their condition. 3. Member experience with health plan: Member surveys about the plan. 4. Member complaints and changes in the health plan's performance: How often members had problems with the plan. Includes how much the plan's performance improved (if at all) over time. 5. Health plan customer service: How well the plan handles member calls and questions. For plans that cover prescription drugs, this is a summary rating of drug plan quality for drug-related services that fall into 4 categories and includes: 1. Drug plan customer service: How well the plan handles member calls and questions. 2. Member complaints and changes in the drug plan's performance: How often members had problems with the plan. Includes how much the plan's performance improved (if at all) over time. 3. Member experience with drug plan: Member surveys about the plan. 4. Drug safety and accuracy of drug pricing: How accurate the plan's pricing information is and how often members with certain medical conditions are prescribed drugs in a way that's safer and clinically recommended for their condition. For plans that cover both health services and prescription drugs, the overall star rating for quality and performance covers all of the topics above. 113 SECTION 9: Get more information113 You can compare the quality of health care providers and Medicare plan services nationwide by visiting Medicare.gov or by calling your State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP). See pages 117-120 for the phone number. Medicare is working to better coordinate your care Medicare continues to look for ways to better coordinate your care and to make sure that you get the best health care possible. Here are examples of how your health care providers can better coordinate your care: Electronic Health Records Electronic health records are a history of your medical conditions, health care, and treatment that your doctor, other health care provider, medical office staff, or hospital keeps on a computer. They can help lower the chances of medical errors, eliminate duplicate tests, and may improve your overall quality of care. Your doctor's electronic health records may be able to link to a hospital, lab, pharmacy, other doctors, or immunization information systems (registries), so the people who care for you can have a more complete picture of your health. Electronic prescribing This is an electronic way for your prescribers (your doctor or other health care provider who's legally allowed to write prescriptions) to send your prescriptions directly to your pharmacy. Electronic prescribing can save you money and time, and help keep you safe. Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) An ACO is a group of doctors, hospitals, and/or other health care providers that work together to improve the quality and experience of care you get. These organizations may help health care providers better coordinate your care and are intended to give you better quality care. Coordinated care saves time and costs by avoiding repeated tests and unneeded appointments. It may make it easier to spot potential problems before they become more serious\u2014like drug interactions that can happen if one doctor isn't aware of what another has prescribed. Medicare evaluates how well each organization meets these goals every year. ACOs that do a good job can earn a financial bonus. If they earn a bonus, these organizations may use the payment to invest more in your care or share a portion directly with your health care providers. Sometimes, ACOs may owe money to Medicare if their care increases costs. An ACO can't limit your choice of health care providers. Your Original Medicare benefits aren't changing. You still have the right to visit any doctor, hospital, or other provider that accepts Medicare at any time, just like you do now. It isn't a Medicare Advantage Plan , which is an alternative to Original Medicare, offered by private companies approved by Medicare. It also isn't an HMO plan, or an insurance plan of any kind. 114 SECTION 9: Get more information114 Note: If your primary care provider has notified you that they're participating in an ACO and you need skilled nursing facility care , talk to your provider about the Skilled Nursing Facility 3-Day Rule Waiver. This waiver may allow Medicare to cover certain skilled nursing facility services without requiring you to have a 3-day inpatient hospital stay before getting skilled nursing facility coverage. The 3-Day Rule Waiver doesn't apply if you could be treated as an outpatient, or require long-term care. Sharing your health care information with ACOs To help your providers coordinate your health care better, Medicare gives certain information about your care to ACOs that are working with your health care providers. Giving your data to your ACO and doctor helps make sure all the providers involved in your care have access to your health information when and where they need it. If you don't want Medicare to share your health care information in this manner, call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227). TTY users can call 1-877-486-2048. If you decide you don't want Medicare to give your health care information to your ACO or doctor, Medicare will continue to use your information for some purposes, like evaluating the financial and quality of care performance of the health care providers participating in ACOs. If you have questions or concerns, you can talk about them during your office visit with your health care provider. Note: Patients whose primary care provider participates in an ACO may have access to additional tools or services. Log into (or create) your secure Medicare account at Medicare .gov to select a primary care provider who can help you manage your health care in an ACO.

Assignment An agreement by your doctor, provider, or supplier to be paid directly by Medicare, to accept the payment amount Medicare approves for the service, and not to bill you for any more than the Medicare deductible and coinsurance. Benefit period The way that Original Medicare measures your use of hospital and skilled nursing facility services. A benefit period begins the day you're admitted as an inpatient in a hospital or skilled nursing facility. The benefit period ends when you haven't gotten any inpatient hospital care (or skilled care in a skilled nursing facility) for 60 days in a row. If you go into a hospital or a skilled nursing facility after one benefit period has ended, a new benefit period begins. You must pay the inpatient hospital deductible for each benefit period. There's no limit to the number of benefit periods. Coinsurance An amount you may be required to pay as your share of the cost for services after you pay any deductibles. Coinsurance is usually a percentage (for example, 20%). Copayment An amount you may be required to pay as your share of the cost for a medical service or supply, like a doctor's visit, hospital outpatient visit, or prescription drug. A copayment is usually a set amount, rather than a percentage. For example, you might pay $10 or $20 for a doctor's visit or prescription drug. Creditable prescription drug coverage Prescription drug coverage (for example, from an employer or union) that's expected to pay, on average, at least as much as Medicare's standard prescription drug coverage. People who have this kind of coverage when they become eligible for Medicare can generally keep that coverage without paying a penalty, if they decide to enroll in Medicare prescription drug coverage later. 122 SECTION 10: Definitions122 Critical access hospital A small facility located in a rural area more than 35 miles (or 15 miles if mountainous terrain or in areas with only secondary roads) from another hospital or critical access hospital. This facility provides 24/7 emergency care, has 25 or fewer inpatient beds, and maintains an average length of stay of 96 hours or less for acute care patients. Deductible The amount you must pay for health care or prescriptions before Original Medicare, your Medicare Advantage Plan, your Medicare drug plan, or your other insurance begins to pay. Demonstrations Special projects, sometimes called \"pilot programs\" or \"research studies,\" that test improvements in Medicare coverage, payment, and quality of care. They usually operate only for a limited time, for a specific group of people, and in specific areas. Extra Help A Medicare program to help people with limited income and resources pay Medicare prescription drug program costs, like premiums, deductibles, and coinsurance. Formulary A list of prescription drugs covered by a prescription drug plan or another insurance plan offering prescription drug benefits. Also called a drug list. Inpatient rehabilitation facility A hospital, or part of a hospital, that provides an intensive rehabilitation program to inpatients. Lifetime reserve days In Original Medicare, these are additional days that Medicare will pay for when you're in a hospital for more than 90 days. You have a total of 60 reserve days that can be used during your lifetime. For each lifetime reserve day, Medicare pays all covered costs except for a daily coinsurance. Long-term care hospital Acute care hospitals that provide treatment for patients who stay, on average, more than 25 days. Most patients are transferred from an intensive or critical care unit. Services provided include comprehensive rehabilitation, respiratory therapy, head trauma treatment, and pain management. Medicaid A joint federal and state program that helps with medical costs for some people with limited income and (in some cases) resources. Medicaid programs vary from state to state, but most health care costs are covered if you qualify for both Medicare and Medicaid.123123 SECTION 10: Definitions123 Medically necessary Health care services or supplies needed to diagnose or treat an illness, injury, condition, disease, or its symptoms and that meet accepted standards of medicine. Medicare Advantage Plan (Part C) A type of Medicare health plan offered by a private company that contracts with Medicare. Medicare Advantage Plans provide all of your Part A and Part B benefits, with a few exclusions, for example, certain aspects of clinical trials which are covered by Original Medicare even though you're still in the plan. Medicare Advantage Plans include: Health Maintenance Organizations Preferred Provider Organizations Private Fee-for-Service Plans Special Needs Plans Medicare Medical Savings Account Plans If you're enrolled in a Medicare Advantage Plan: Most Medicare services are covered through the plan Most Medicare services aren't paid for by Original Medicare Most Medicare Advantage Plans offer prescription drug coverage. Medicare-approved amount In Original Medicare, this is the amount a doctor or supplier that accepts assignment can be paid. It may be less than the actual amount a doctor or supplier charges. Medicare pays part of this amount and you're responsible for the difference. Medicare health plan Generally, a plan offered by a private company that contracts with Medicare to provide Part A and Part B benefits to people with Medicare who enroll in the plan. Medicare health plans include all Medicare Advantage Plans, Medicare Cost Plans, and Demonstration/Pilot Programs. Program of All-inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) organizations are special types of Medicare health plans. PACE plans can be offered by public or private companies and provide Part D and other benefits in addition to Part A and Part B benefits. Medicare plan Any way other than Original Medicare that you can get your Medicare health or drug coverage. This term includes all Medicare health plans and Medicare drug plans. Medigap Medicare Supplement Insurance sold by private insurance companies to fill \"gaps\" in Original Medicare coverage.124 SECTION 10: Definitions124 National Provider Identifier (NPI) A unique identification number for covered health care providers. Premium The periodic payment to Medicare, an insurance company, or a health care plan for health or prescription drug coverage. Preventive services Health care to prevent illness or detect illness at an early stage, when treatment is likely to work best (for example, preventive services include Pap tests, flu shots, and screening mammograms). Primary care doctor The doctor you see first for most health problems. They make sure you get the care you need to keep you healthy. They also may talk with other doctors and health care providers about your care and refer you to them. In many Medicare Advantage Plans, you must see your primary care doctor before you see any other health care provider. Referral A written order from your primary care doctor for you to see a specialist or get certain medical services. In many Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs), you need to get a referral before you can get medical care from anyone except your primary care doctor. If you don't get a referral first, the plan may not pay for the services. Service area A geographic area where the plan accepts members. The plan may limit membership based on where people live. For plans that limit which doctors and hospitals you may use, it's also generally the area where you can get routine (non-emergency) services. The plan may disenroll you if you move out of the plan's service area. Skilled nursing facility (SNF) care Skilled nursing care and therapy services provided on a daily basis, in a skilled nursing facility. Examples of skilled nursing facility care include physical therapy or intravenous injections that can only be given by a physical therapist or a registered nurse.125 Medicare d'aider, ) yon w ap ede, gen , se dwa w pou jwenn \u00e8d ak enf\u00f2masyon nan lang ou pale a, pou pa peye pou sa.
